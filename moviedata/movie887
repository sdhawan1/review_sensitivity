     Just when it was starting to look like comedy was plucked, along 
comes the funniest movie of the year to put it back on its perch.  This 
will come as no surprise to fans of Nick Park and Peter Lord, the 
geniuses behind the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit shorts. 
     Park and Lord work in claymation, a process so slow and painstaking 
you can't imagine how they can find anything funny.  But oh, do they!  
In their first feature-length film, produced through Dreamworks, they've 
created a hilarious spoof on WWII POW movies like The Great Escape.  But 
you don't have to know the sources - Chicken Run is funny and endearing 
and completely entertaining in its own right.
     The action takes place on the chicken farm of Mr. And Mrs. Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson), a grim stalag of barracks where 
chickens must produce or perish.  Some of them take it lying down, but 
not Ginger (Julia Sawalha of TV's AbFab), a plucky little hen with 
escape in her blood.  "So, laying eggs all your life and then getting 
stuffed and roasted, that's good enough for you, is it?" she demands, to 
which another chicken (Jane Horrocks of Little Voice) replies "It's a 
living."
     When the Tweedys install a chicken pot pie machine, things get 
desperate - when out of the sky comes what looks like the answer to 
Ginger's prayers: Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson), a refugee from 
a circus who calls himself "The Lone Free Ranger."  She offers to hide 
him if he'll teach them all how to fly.
     What makes Lord and Park's work so great is a deeply wonderful 
sense of humor, both verbal and visual.  It's in the timing, in the 
characters, in the lines, in the lighting and the camera angles and the 
sets and the music (including the R&B classic "Flip, Flop and Fly".)  In 
a world of computerized high-tech, this is basic, and brilliant.

"No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!" is the challenge taken on by one
plucky chicken named Ginger (Julia Sawalha). Ginger wants a better world for 
herself and her friends, the other inmates at the Tweedy's Egg Farm, so she 
attempts one breakout after another, only to end up in solitary every time. 
But, the clock is running out for Ginger and her fowl friends as the evil Mrs. 
Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) finds a new way to feather her nest - instead of 
gathering their eggs, she plans to turn her chickens into pies! With the help 
of a new arrival, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), the self-acclaimed Lone Free 
Ranger, Ginger hatches a spectacular and daring escape plan, a plan that will 
free them all in "Chicken Run."
The makers of "Chicken Run," co-directors and co-producers Nick Park and Peter
Lord, have elevated the art of claymation to a pinnacle with such works as the
Oscar nominated animated short, "Wat's Pig" and Oscar winners, "Creature
Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers" and "A Close Shave." The latter two established
the characters, Wallace and Gromit, as figures of international popularity. So,
the anticipation among the fans of Aardman Entertainment for their first
feature has been long and expectant. And the word?
"Chicken Run" is a parody of and homage to all the great POW and prison break
movies we have seen over the decades. Most prominent is the best of them all,
the 1963 John Sturges classic "The Great Escape," which the Park/Lord film so
lovingly recreates. At the very opening, Ginger is in the midst of breaking out
of her prison, only to be thwarted by the "goons," Mr. Tweedy and his vicious
guard dogs. The following montage shows the indefatigable Ginger trying again
and again, only to fail and end up in the hole. Her spirit never flags, though,
so, when Rocky, quite literally, flies into her life, hope for escape to the
fabled Paradise Farm is rejuvenated.
I don't want to get into the meat of the story of "Chicken Run." That is best
left for the filmmakers to do when you see it yourself, which I hope everyone
does. Suffice it to say that this is the most fun I have had at the movies
since "Toy Story 2." Park/Lord have made an indelible mark in the annals of 
feature animation that rivals The Giant - Disney. The painstaking nature of the
claymation technique requires years to produce a full-length film and the folks
at Aardman took the time to learn their lessons. Their entry into the big time
is nothing less than spectacular.
Don't get me wrong. "Chicken Run" is not a perfect film. At about the 25-minute
mark, the story started to wind down and I thought I would see a good, not
great, animation. Things quickly take a turn for the better as the tale of
escape cranks up, Ginger makes her plans and Rocky provides the beefcake for
the ladies at Tweedy's farm. The story, basically, follows the same plot as 
"The Great Escape," but with the chickens facing a more onerous fate than just 
being prisoners. The imperative of escape reaches serious proportions as their 
true fate - to become the primary ingredient of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken 
Pies - is realized. High drama, comedy and action prevail 'til the end.
Besides "The Great Escape" (the direct references to which had me in stitches)
there are allusions to such other terrific POW films as "Stalag 17." 
The amazing thing about "Chicken Run" is that it takes such subjects as
genocide (or, is that chicken-ocide?) and imprisonment and puts a humorous spin
on it without being silly. Don't get me wrong, there is enough silliness and
dumb, funny humor to appeal to the kids (and "Hogan's Heroes" fans) in the
audience. There is also a plethora of intelligence and wit, coupled with some
very dark humor, to keep the adult population attentive and entertained.
The vocal characterizations, with their onscreen images, are first rate. While
Mel Gibson is the name name, the rest of the cast, led by Sawalha (daughter
Sapphire of "Absolutely Fabulous) as Ginger, are equal to their characters.
Except for Miranda Richardson as the voice of Mrs. Tweedy, you won't recognize
many of the British cast members. Jane Horrocks ("Little Voice," and Bubble in
"Ab Fab") gives voice to the simple, but lovable, Babs, who is forever
knitting.  Stage actress Lynn Ferguson provides an enjoyable Scottish burr to 
Mac, a super-intelligent hen who is the engineering brains of the escape team.
Benjamin Whitrow as the aging rooster Fowler, Tony Haygarth as the dumb but 
observant Mr. Tweedy, Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels as the rat procurers Nick 
and Fetcher all contribute to the depth of character this 86-minute marvel of a 
movie deserves.
The production, especially to those who are familiar with the painstaking
nature of claymation, is a wonder to behold. Within minutes of the start of 
the film, the viewer is completely taken over by the world created by the 
Aardman folks.  The attention to details, such as every chicken being a unique 
character with her own look and personality, is astounding. The current hype, 
today, for computer generated imagery (CGI) is put to shame by the shear 
craftsmanship of this stellar example of such a traditional technique. Stop 
motion animation has been around since the early days of movies and "Chicken 
Run" is at the pinnacle of its art.
"Chicken Run" should be seen by the whole family. Actually, it should be seen
by everyone. It has intelligence, humor, drama and tragedy, dance numbers, 
amour and more, any of which will have appeal to someone out there. The 
sinister aspects of the story may be a bit too dark for younger, sensitive 
kids, but the overall lightness of "Chicken Run's" being should help get 
them by.
I don't say this often enough: I give "Chicken Run" an unbridled A.
Fans of triple-Oscar winner Nick Parks' delightful "Wallace and Grommit"
shorts are rewarded with his (and co-director/producer Peter Lord)
long-awaited claymation feature film debut "Chicken Run."
Ginger (Julia Sawalha, "Absolutely Fabulous") is a resourceful hen
among the downtrodden denizens of Tweedy's Chicken Farm, where Mr. Tweedy
(Tony Haygarth, "London Kills Me") suspiciously patrols the barbed wire
perimeters of his chicken huts with two vicious guard dogs.  Ginger
dreams of a life of freedom, beyond the grassy hills she can she from
the roof of her hut, but although she's capable of escaping herself, her
vision includes all her friends at the farm, who she refuses to abandon.
When one hen fails to produce eggs, she's removed to the chopping block
(reminiscent of Babe's almost-fate) by the unrelentingly mean Mrs. Tweedy 
(Miranda Richardson, "Sleepy Hollow").  To make matters worse, a chicken 
products van arrives delivering a mysterious contraption that's hidden in 
the barn.  Only Mr. Tweedy's problems getting it to work are buying Ginger 
time to plot their escape.
A savior arrives in the form of an arrogant Yank rooster, Rocky (Mel Gibson),
who arrives catapulted over the fence yelling 'Freedom!' at the top of his
lungs (the film's punched up with many movie in-jokes referencing the
likes of "Braveheart," "Stalag 17" and, most notably, "The Great Escape").
Ginger enlists his help to teach her girls how to fly.
The screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick ("James and the Giant Peach") tells
a traditionally simple tale.  The pleasures of "Chicken Run" are to be
found in its marvelous details (a V of geese pass overhead as Ginger 
watches the sun set from behind a fence, two huckster rats pass off a
tub stopper on a chain as a necklace for sale), terrific characterizations
and vocal performances, a darkness reflected in the look of the film 
and the painstaking process of the claymation itself.
Hundreds of distinctly different chickens were created for this film,
several of whom lend terrific support to Ginger and Rocky.  Janes Horrocks
("Little Voice" and another "Absolutely Fabulous" vet) is Babs, a sweetly
dim bird with a serious knitting habit.  Lynn Ferguson (a Scottish stage
actress and standup comedienne) is Mac, the bespeckled engineering genius
who provides a marvelous foil for Rocky's "Braveheart" moments.  Benjamin
Whitrow ("A Man for All Seasons") is Fowler, the elderly RAF vet and house
rooster who resents Rocky's arrival and vents the British spleen at the
Americans late arrival into WWII.
Outside of the chickens, there are only two humans - the Tweedys.  Mrs.
Tweedy is a dried up crone who resents her husband's inability to provide
something better than their bleak farm.  Mr. Tweedy is henpencked indeed
and accused of losing his mind when he suggests their chickens are plotting.
Two rats, Nick (Timothy Spall, "Love's Labour's Lost") and Fetcher (Phil
Daniels, "Bad Behavior") provide comic relief and suggest the "King Rat"
aspect of the farm with their black market trading.
While "Chicken Run" is a delightful achievement, it doesn't quite attain
the constant brilliance of the "Wallace and Grommit" shorts.  Ironically, 
there's no "Feathers McGraw" moment - the startling hilarity of a penguin 
passing himself off as a chicken with a rubber glove on his head in "The 
Wrong Trousers."  Still, kudos to the huge group of filmmakers whose
patience with the stop-motion technique has brought this charmer for young
and old alike to the screen.

     Nick Park's three Wallace and Gromit shorts for Aardman Animation --
A GRAND DAY OUT, THE WRONG TROUSERS and A CLOSE SHAVE -- are examples of
inspired, brilliant film-making. Park's feature film debut -- CHICKEN RUN,
co-directed with Peter Lord -- is not. Sometimes it's hard to accept
simple quality when you've come to expect genius; I suspect I'll cry a
river of tears when John Lasseter finally produces a film that's merely
good. CHICKEN RUN is unlike virtually any other animated film you're
likely to see this summer, and not just because the characters are
manipulated pieces of clay instead of drawings or CGI creations. It's an
appealing, well-crafted film with a unique sensibility and a few
wonderfully imaginative scenes. And its script can't manage one-tenth of
the wit verbally that the rest of the film creates visually.
     The familiar Aardman goggle eyes and extra-wide mouths are attached
to fowl faces in CHICKEN RUN, set at a Yorkshire poultry farm. One
industrious hen named Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is ever plotting her escape
from the clutches of Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) and Mr. Tweedy (Tony
Haygarth), but every plan she hatches is thwarted by her well-intentioned
but bumbling fellow egg-layers. Then a potential savior literally falls
from the sky: Rocky (Mel Gibson), a cocky American cock who has escaped
from his gig as "amazing flying chicken" with the circus. Rocky has
wounded a wing in his crash landing, but Ginger sees him as the final
piece of the escape puzzle. After all, if Rocky can fly, he can surely
teach the chicks of Tweedy Farm a thing or two about getting airborne.
     The broad structure of CHICKEN RUN is a satire of World War II POW
films -- Ginger and her pals are "inmates" of Coop 17 -- but the genre
gags form only a tiny part of the film. The rest of the narrative involves
a fairly banal bickering relationship between Ginger and Rocky,
occasionally jazzed up by a nod to the love-hate relationship between
Brits and Yanks. The dialogue could have stuck to that angle for its
humor, but screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick instead opts for a seemingly
endless litany of ghastly puns. Gibson, Sawalha and many of the other
performers do energetic voice work, despite the absence of much energy
devoted to developing characters. As long as the characters are flapping
their beaks, CHICKEN RUN is fairly limp stuff.
     That CHICKEN RUN soars highest when it's silent probably comes as no
surprise to Wallace and Gromit devotees, who know that Park has a gift for
elaborately constructed sight gags. CHICKEN RUN's finest moments showcase
that gift, from the opening credits montage of Ginger's unsuccessful
escape attempts to the climactic mid-air showdown with Mrs. Tweedy. In
between, there's the deliriously funny sequence in which Rocky comes to
Ginger's rescue when she's strapped into an automated chicken pot
pie-making machine. The clockwork comic timing is vintage Nick Park, with
the nods to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK actually underplayed so that they
simply add flavor to an already priceless set piece. And then there are
tiny pleasures like a teapot disguised as a hen, and a group of hens in a
synchronized tai chi display. The depth and texture of the clay-mation
world is satisfying enough; the things the film-makers do with that world
are a joy to behold.
     There's nothing about the Aardman style that demands the animated
equivalent of silent film storytelling; the classic short CREATURE
COMFORTS wedded person-on-the-street dialogue with clay critters to
charming effect. This particular story, however, has the processed flavor
of a dozen other animated films. The characters never get enough chance to
develop the personality Gromit packs into one furrowing of his plasticine
brow, because they're too busy clucking off Kirkpatrick's one-line 
groaners. I'm thoroughly convinced Nick Park has a positively glorious
feature film in him -- perhaps it's the Wallace and Gromit feature planned
for a few years hence -- but this one isn't quite it. It's an entertaining
warm-up, a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff. In
short, it's simply good. When you've got a genius at your disposal, that's
not quite good enough.

Year: 2000. Starring the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Miranda

Whitrow. Written by Peter Lord & Nick Park (story) and Karey Kirkpatrick
(screenplay). Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Rated G.
I know that "funnest" isn't a word. "Fun" is a noun, and therefore
cannot be conjugated like an adjective. But that's the word that
came to me right after viewing "Chicken Run." No wonder: This is the kind
of movie that reduces you to childish expressions, like "That was the
funnest movie I've ever seen!" So to hell with Webster's --
"Chicken Run" is one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while. I
can't remember the last time I've seen anything funner.
The chickens at Tweedy's Farm are up to something. Living in a
concentration camp-like atmosphere, they are led by one plucky hen called
Ginger (voice of Julia Sawalha) who continually comes up with plans for
escape -- and always gets caught, subsequently spending day after day in
the coal box. One night, a brash American rooster flies in over the
fence, calling himself Rocky (Mel Gibson), famous flying rooster and
circus performer. Rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly, and
the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda
Richardson) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a
pie-selling plan. She orders a huge pie-making machine, cackling,
"Chickens go in; pies come out." What sort of pies? Chicken pies, of
course.
Co-director Nick Park and his studio, Aardman Animation, produced three
Oscar-winning short films: "Creature Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers," and
"A Close Shave." The latter two were the second and third installments of
a trilogy starring the delightful team Wallace & Gromit, a man and his
dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures.
Part of what made the "Wallace" films brilliantly entertaining was
Park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new. "The Wrong
Trousers," for example, pulled out a lot of old Hitchcockian suspense
tricks, and "A Close Shave" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic
detective stories. But in the hands of Park and his team, the stories
felt fresh and inspired, and not the least bit contrived.
Now teaming with co-director Peter Lord, Park has created a similar
creature in "Chicken Run." The plot is largely lifted from "The Great
Escape" (watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene), with
some Spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement. Thing
is, the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from
somewhere else; "Chicken Run" feels fresh, alive, like nothing else ever
done. Part of it is the original idea: Who in the world came up with the
idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens? Park and Lord
milk the incongruity for all it's worth: The characters treat their
situation as if it were dead serious, and to them, it is. But
they're *chickens*, so it's funny to us.
Another thing that helps "Chicken Run" (and most of Park's films)
succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very
films they're cribbing. There are references to "The Great Escape,"
obviously, and "Stalag 17." The chase sequence inside the chicken grinder
parodies both "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom." There's even a nod to "The Blues Brothers," if you can
believe it, and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing
at the expense of their star voice actor, taking a couple of very subtle
jabs at Mel Gibson's nationality and film history. The "Braveheart"
reference is a hoot if you catch it.
When you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and
a redundant one, "Chicken Run" is downright brilliant in its execution.
Consider this: Since July of last year, I've seen dozens upon
dozens of "Blair Witch Project" parodies, on television, on the radio,
and online. Out of all those, maybe one or two were amusing, the rest
tiresome. Why? Because once you got past the thought that "they're
parodying that‘ Blair Witch' movie," most of the parodies had
nothing to offer -- no insight, no original idea, no greater purpose.
They were only funny if you had seen the movie; otherwise, you got
nothing. Conversely, "Chicken Run" doesn't lean on its parodies --
the film references are never the sole focus of any scene. If
you've never seen "Indiana Jones," the chase sequence is still fun.
Even if you have no idea who Mel Gibson is, Rocky remains an interesting
character. Park, Lord, and screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick realize that an
audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's
understood, and as a result, "Chicken Run" is filled with visual and
verbal jabs that are never too obvious, but not quite vague either.
Enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history,
but if you've got it, "Chicken Run" is that much richer.
The voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances, and the characters
they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to
fall in love with every one of them. Ginger is perfect, spunky and
opinionated, but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her
companions behind, and Julia Sawalha (known as the cute mousy girl on
"Absolutely Fabulous") nails it. She has warm, human chemistry with
Gibson, whose Rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho
veneer. The characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel
contrived, but sweet. Poor Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) suspects the
chickens are organizing in some way, but his limited intellect prevents
him from figuring things out, and his overbearing wife certainly
isn't any help. Jane Horrocks delivers a lovely voice
characterization as tragically optimistic Babs (a hen that runs away with
most of the best one-liners, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater),
and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a
Monty Python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central
swing-dancing sequence. They even come up with an inspired riff on
something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for
decades: the chicken vs. egg dilemma. One might have expected this
inevitable joke to come off as wearisome, but as with most of "Chicken
Run," it comes as a delightful surprise.
The film manages to cross all barriers; it should be accessible to both
children and adults, Brits and Yanks, rats and chickens. The animation is
first-rate. Remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way, with
actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by
painstaking bit, and you see just how truly remarkable "Chicken Run"
really is. This movie possesses that same quality that makes Pixar
Studios' animation great: precise and unwavering attention to
detail. As in such top-notch family fare as "A Bug's Life" or "Toy
Story 2," "Chicken Run" has something to offer in nearly every frame.
Certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a
worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes, but a active,
attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all
the details.
Anyway, the movie's just a boatload of fun. Funnest damn movie
I've seen all year.

The escape film is a standard genre which has been employed throughout
motion picture history. Its inherent tension and suspense provide a
natural framework on which to build a gripping story, and this has
been done so often that it is difficult to create anything original
within that genre. However, being such a stalwart formula also makes
it a ripe target for parody, and this film does that by replacing all
the standard human characters with primarily chickens.
The film is an animated feature made by a process of stop motion
animation with clay figures - "claymation", a specialization of
Aardman Production, which produced this film. It is written and
directed by Nick Park (who is known for his claymation shorts Wallace
and Grommit) and Peter Lord. This technique has been in existence
since the early days of film, but has become rare since the
development of less labor intensive special effects, notably computer
generated imagery.
The story takes place at the Tweedy chicken farm, where the resident
chickens (all hens save for one aged rooster) are held captive. They
are constantly searching for a way to escape the unpleasant conditions
at the farm, where they must keep up their egg production quotas or
literally get the axe. They make many attempts to escape, led by
natural leader Ginger (Julia Sawalha), but never meet with any
success. One day they see Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson) fly overhead
and accidentally crash into their fenced compound. In Rocky, they see
someone who could teach them to fly, and thus give them a means to
escape the farm and reach a sanctuary to live a life of freedom.
Although a grim storyline is the basis of the plot, this is actually a
funny and entertaining film. Their enclosure is portrayed as the
common prisoner of war camp of film, and all the components of that
genre are expressed - clandestine meetings, contrived escape plans,
close camaraderie from shared hardship, and a barter economy with
black market traders (in this case, Cockney rats).
Although it may appear derivative, the story goes to such great detail
to anthropomorphize the chickens, that it feels that the genre itself
is the aspect being manipulated to fit the plot. When a formulaic
storyline is used as a shortcut for original, writing, it is dreary.
When it is used as a basis for a genre spoof, it can be the outlet for
intelligent humor. Discerning viewers will notice the multiple layers
employed by the film, and will be impressed by the challenges that the
film sets and meets.
The film is constructed to have appeal for all viewers. It does not
euphemize death and killing for its younger audience, but it also does
not present intentionally disturbing images. For younger viewers, the
film provides colorful characters, typical cartoon action sequences,
and limited musical sequences. For adult viewers, it provides clever
one-liners, caricatures of stereotypical characters, and subtle
references to classic films.
Highly recommended. This film uses a standard storyline to great
effect. It is a simple, common structure that can be followed by
children, and it is also a target for parody that will entertain adult
viewers. It is consistently humorous, entertaining, and clever, and
thus has appeal for a wide audience.

 ChickenRun (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal talents of
Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson, Jane Horrocks, Imelda
Staunton, Benjamin Whitrow, Lynn Ferguson, Tony Haygarth, Timothy Spall
and Phil Daniels. Screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick and Jack Rosenthal.
Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Rated G.
While a student at Ohio University in the late 60s (1960s, that is),
the university had a program called the MIA, which stood for Movies in
Auditorium.
 Every Friday and Saturday night, students would troop to Mem Aud, as we
called Memorial Auditorium, to see a not-so-old movie.
 Two of the most popular - they were screened every quarter - were "The
Magnificent Seven" and "The Great Escape." I saw the latter so many
times that by my senior year, I'd be whistling along with "The Great
Escape's" music track over the opening titles.
 What brought this wave of nostalgia to mind was "Chicken Run," a
wonderfully daft Claymation comedy from the team behind the popular
Oscar-winning `Wallace and Gromit' shorts.
 Trapped behind barbed wire, a group of prisoners plot their escape.
Time after time, they try and fail to flee their barbaric surroundings.
 Only these prisoners are chickens and their stalag is Tweedy's Chicken
Farm where certain death awaits any chicken who doesn't meet her egg
quota.
 Led by Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawahla of "Absolutely Fabulous" fame),
the hens devise plan after plan, including such classic ruses as
tunneling under the compound and cutting through the barbed wire.
 "Chicken Run" utilizes all the clichés from the classic p.o.w.-escape
genre and, in doing so, brings off one of the most entertaining vehicles
of the year.
 For the movie takes all the stereotypical elements found in such
adventures and endows those characteristics in chickens. There's the
Scottish engineer who's always calculating the probability of success or
failure and the veteran sergeant-major type who believes in maintaining
discipline and tradition even under the most dire circumstances.
 Then there''s the solitary Yank, the cocky American who assures the
chickens he can lead them in a successful mass exodus.
 Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) crash lands in the compound, creating the
mistaken belief that he can fly. Rocky enjoys all the clucking and
fussing. But he neglects to inform the others that the only way he can
take to the air is to be shot out of a cannon. Rocky, it is learned, is
an escapee from a nearby circus.
 Cocky Rocky (he calls himself `the lone free-ranger') bamboozles the
hens until the truth is uncovered. But the indomitable Ginger won't give
up, leading to a soaring, splendid finale.
 "Chicken Run" is witty and charming in that veddy, veddy understated
British manner. As directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park, you soon forget
the characters are merely clay figures moved frame-by-frame by hand.
 There are no computer-generated images here. This movie was done the
old-fashioned way, one shot at a time. And the care shows.
 "Chicken Run" contains some wonderful moments. Continually thrown into
`solitary' (actually a coal bin) for her many escape attempts, Ginger,
at one point, begins bouncing a wall off the coal bin wall, a homage to
Steve McQueen and "The Great Escape."
 A wonderfully scary sequence concerns a Rube Goldberg-like contraption
purchased by Mrs. Tweedy who has decided the farm would make more money
selling chicken pies than chicken eggs.
 Ginger, caught in the deadly machinery, is rescued in the nick of time
by Rocky in an exciting sequence.
 The movie's vocal talent is first rate. Gibson gives a sturdy comedic
performance as the self-assured cock of the walk.
 Sawalha is all determination and grit as the leader of the hens, while
Miranda Richardson exudes menace as the evil Mrs. Tweedy, a character
who could cause nightmares for the very young viewers.
 "Chicken Run," at about 80 minutes, never falters. The uplifting finale
will have you cheering. It is an original, entertaining feature the
entire family can enjoy.

     Nick Park is now a three time Academy Award winner having won
Oscars for his shorts "Creature Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers," and
"A Close Shave."  The latter two feature his characters Wallace and
Gromit.  He has made his trademark to have his clay animation
characters have teeth that do not quite fill the cheeks from side to
side so there is a gap on each side.  In this country his style may
best be recognized in some commercials he has done, particularly
Chevron ads with talking cars.  It takes a little chutzpah for him
to do a feature length film with chickens satirizing World War II
POW escape films like THE PASSWORD IS COURAGE, STALAG 17, THE
COLDITZ STORY, and especially THE GREAT ESCAPE.  In the first place
it is a little hard for Park and co-director Peter Lord to sustain
one joke for that length of time.  The joke in his popular Wallace
and Gromit stories are that Wallace is such a dull personality.  It
takes considerably more character value to keep an audience
interested for 85 minutes.  In the second place chickens do not have
teeth or wide cheeks so he must give up his trademark or have his
chickens look not very much like chickens.  He does the latter.
Does the Nick Park charm work for a feature film?  In my opinion,
not really.  There were chuckles throughout the film but the story
is cliched and silly.  Apparently that is part of the point and that
can be done in satire if the film just remains entertaining.  It
becomes a little too much of the same good thing.
     Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is one smart chicken.  She
knows that her days are numbered at the chicken farm where she
lives.  Sooner or later she will stop producing eggs.  And she knows
that when a chicken stops providing breakfast, she provides dinner.
So every night she tries to escape from the barbed wire fences and
every night she is caught and thrown into solitary confinement.
After several attempts and after involving other chickens, she is
about at her chicken-wits' end.
     No escape plan works until an American rooster named Rocky the
Rooster (Mel Gibson) comes flying over the compound one day.  So
chickens can fly!  The news is inspiration to all the hens.  They
convince a reluctant Rocky to teach the group to fly and lead them
all over the fence.  There are a lot of jokes, but most are more
cute than funny.  The few surprises in the plot have a way of
telegraphing themselves.  The plot seems to have been written on
autopilot and, except for the choice of animals, is very familiar.
John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams provide a nice military score
reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein's score for THE GREAT ESCAPE.
     Park and Lord have chosen a number of major British actresses
to voice the chickens and humans, though their names will be
familiar mostly to art house crowds here.  He has Miranda Richardson
(of THE CRYING GAME and MERLIN), Jane Horrocks (of LITTLE VOICE) and
Imelda Staunton.  The main character is played by Julia Sawalha who
is almost unknown in the US.  To balance this, apparently top
billing unjustifiably goes to Mel Gibson.
     Park's cartoons have always had a dark side and this film has a
few grim scenes involving head chopping that could be disturbing to
younger children, so parents should not be fooled by the G-rating.
In some ways this film is even grimmer than the war films it
imitates.  The prisoners in the war had the Geneva Convention to
give them some protection and they could look forward to being
released at the end of the war.  These chickens could be killed any
time at the farmer's will and their captivity would never end of its
own.  So if you look for it the story is fairly grim.  Still, the
script shies away from looking at the implications of the treatment
of domestic animals unlike some better films like Caroline
Thompson's excellent BLACK BEAUTY (1994).
     This film is a "curate's egg" as the British would say. Some
parts are much better than others.  Overall it does not deliver
quite enough.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4
to +4 scale.  Stay through the end of the credits.

DreamWorks has more than made up for its recent family debacle The Road
to El Dorado with Chicken Run, the best children's movie since the
inception of the Toy Story franchise.  The premise  a unlikely blend of
Nick Park's quirky, Oscar-winning animation and British humor combined
with the prison-break genre  hardly seems like the kind of thing a
typical American family would drag their kids to on Saturday afternoon,
but Run is the rare exception of a film that is extremely enjoyable
across the entire demographic board.
Armed with clever television spots that rip off Gladiator (`The egg that
became a chicken') and Mission: Impossible 2 (read C:R-1), Run is set on
Tweedy's Farm, where a large group of chickens lives in constant fear of
the low egg production that would enrage the farm's diabolical owner,
Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson, Sleepy Hollow).  If you don't make with
the embryos, you get the axe, and most of the chickens are happy enough
to go along with the farm's simple rules.  The one exception is a spunky
hen named Ginger (Julia Sawalha, Saffron from Absolutely Fabulous), who
spends her days dreaming up ways to escape.  It's easy enough to for her
to break out on her own, but Ginger is determined to take all of the
other chickens with her, as well.  To get supplies for her schemes, she
trades eggs with two entrepreneurial rats dressed in bad suits.
Run's hilarious opening credits feature a montage of Ginger's failed
Wile E. Coyote-type escape attempts (featuring the funniest blueprints
since Jay and Silent Bob's drafts in Mallrats), each resulting in her
being tossed into the coal bin by the henpecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony
Haygarth) and his two vicious dogs.  One night, while Ginger is
wallowing in self-doubt about her ability to rescue her friends, she
encounters what appears to be a flying rooster that lands in the chicken
compound.  The cock is Rocky `the Rooster' Rhodes (Mel Gibson, Payback),
and as he streaks through the sky, he shouts `Freedom!' like Gibson's
memorable deathbed line in Braveheart.
Ginger and her mates see Rocky as their saving grace and agree to
temporarily hide the rooster from his former keepers (a circus, where he
performed as `The Lone Free Ranger') in exchange for flying lessons.  Of
course, roosters can't fly, and the middle third of the film
concentrates on the American Rocky scamming the British chickens by
saying he'll teach them everything he knows about flying.  Standouts
among the other birds include a dimwitted knitter named Babs (Jane
Horrocks, Little Voice) and a crusty ex-RAF rooster named Fowler
(Benjamin Whitrow).
The need to escape Tweedy's Farm is hastened by the arrival of a
barn-sized machine that makes chicken potpies (`chickens go in  pies
come out').  The contraption is featured in a fantastic scene where
Rocky and Ginger try to escape its gravy-slicked clutches.  It's a
better action sequence that anything in M:I-2 or Gone in 60 Seconds (but
not Gladiator), and it made me incredibly hungry, too.
In addition to sharp marketing slogans (`Escape or Die Frying' and
`Learn to Fly or Bake Like Pie'), Run is full of clever puns (like `It's
raining hen' and  `She's poultry in motion') and makes numerous
references to other films (they meet in Coop No. 17 for their covert
meetings, a la Stalag 17).  At one point, when it's becoming clear that
Rocky might be a scam artist, one hen loudly wonders if the rooster is
even American (Gibson is from Australia).  And on the educational front,
we also learn that chicken not only have teeth, but lips, too (one plays
the harmonica).
Run was co-directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, whose animated Wallace
& Grommit won two Oscars for Best Animated Short.  The screenplay was
written by Karey Kirkpatrick (James & The Giant Peach), who based the
script on an original story by Park and Lord.  Run may be a little
intense for some young children  especially the pie machine, and the
fantastic finale, which I won't even begin to describe here.  The `G'
rating seems a little light here, considering the amount of cowering I
witnessed during these two scenes.

Susan Granger's review of "CHICKEN RUN" (DreamWorks)
What a clever concept! Do you remember "The Great Escape" with
Steve McQueen? It's a W.W.II adventure in which Allied POW's devise a
way out of a Nazi prison camp. Now a similar idea has become an
imaginative claymation comedy, the first full-length feature from
British-based Aardman animation, the Oscar-winning team behind the
popular Wallace & Gromit shorts.
"Chicken Run" follows a group of rebellious chickens imprisoned
at Tweedy's Egg Farm who are determined to break out before they meet
"fowl" play and end up as pot pies. Trapped behind barbed wire and
yearning for freedom, the feisty hen Ginger and her cohorts are
terrorized by menacing, hard-boiled Mrs. Tweedy, who firmly believes,
"Chickens are the most stupid creatures on the planet. They don't
plot; they don't scheme; they don't organize." Until - one day - Rocky
the Rooster, a brash, American "lone free ranger," lands in the
Yorkshire chicken coop. He's on the lam from a circus and, if they
agree to hide him, he promises to teach the entire flock to fly,
despite the obvious aerodynamic deficiencies inherent in the plump
chicken anatomy. "That Yank's not to be trusted" warns the old
R.A.F. rooster named Fowler. Eventually, the scrambling hens hatch an
exciting, if desperate, alternative scheme - with a little help from
two profiteering rats. Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson
and Jane Horrocks head the voice cast and, instead of
computer-generated images, the visual effects are created by
stop-motion animation using clay and silicon models, set in a stylized
universe. Aardman calls it "live action in miniature." On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Chicken Run" is a bright, sunny-side up
9. Good gravy! It's a double-yolk'd chicken delight for the whole
family!

As I watched the sweeping landscapes, gory battles and generally noteworthy 
performances that comprise "The Patriot," a very inappropriate thought simply 
refused to exit my mind: Mel Gibson as a chicken.
Gibson takes on two very different roles in "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run," 
two appropriately diverse films opening in the month of June. In the premier, 
he plays a British-born man who will help lead the American Revolution. In 
the latter, he plays an American-born (?) Rooster who will lead a revolution 
of British chickens. Both very entertaining films - albeit for different 
reasons - the less serious "Chicken Run" is ultimately the superior. 
Nick Park, the possibly-genius director who won an Oscar for his claymation 
"Creature Comforts" and has received wide acclaim for his "Wallace and 
Gromit" films - also claymations - teams up with Peter Lord for "Chicken Run" 
and the product is the first must-see film of the summer and a comedy so 
uproariously funny and unique that it is bound to survive the test of time, 
even if the entire production is nothing more than clay figures being 
meticulously moved very slightly in every frame (24 times every second!) to 
create a live-action appearance. 
"The Patriot," on the other hand, clearly aims for much more than laughs and 
a much more adult audience than the kids who will be most attracted to 
"Chicken Run" (although, the comedy does work on multiple levels and makes a 
great date flick). Unfortunately, "The Patriot" seems to aim too high and 
consequently is only an above-average film, not the great epic that its 
makers clearly set out to create. 
The revolution in "Chicken Run" comes about when a group of already 
disgruntled chickens learn that not only has one of their own been beheaded 
for her inability to lay eggs, but that they are all destined to be baked and 
boxed so that families on the run can zap them in a matter of minutes and 
still have a nutritious meal. Soon after the doomed flock learn this, Rocky - 
the self proclaimed "Lone Free Ranger" - shows up and appears to be their 
ticket to freedom. If the group can learn to fly, they will make it over the 
fence that separates them from freedom and vegetarian pies will have to 
suffice. But the process will be a grueling one in which several cock fights 
will erupt and civility will oftentimes take a back seat to the chaos caused 
by not very fair fowls who are actually rather chicken of what might happen 
to them should their plan fail.
"The Patriot" is decidedly more firmly planted in reality with its entire 
premise being based on the very-real Revolutionary War and a fictional family 
destroyed by it. Screenwriter Robert Rodat takes sole credit for this piece 
and having penned "Saving Private Ryan," - the greatest film ever made in 
this critic's opinion - the similar yet inferior premise is all but marked 
with his own blood. But don't think this production foreign to star Mel 
Gibson either, as the title could well be "Braveheart 2" and few would wince. 
Unfortunately, the plot is overburdened by Rodat's apparent need to kill as 
many people as he can in an attempt to jerk the maximum number of tears 
possible and to try to add excess depth with a slavery based side plot which 
serves no purpose other than to overload the film with morals. 
"The Patriot" does, however, comes across strong with some excellent 
supporting performances, - especially one by Chris Cooper - oftentimes 
breathtaking cinematography and a plot that, like it or not, does tap many 
emotions. 
"Chicken Run," on the other hand, taps many memories. Perhaps Lord and Park's 
brightest move is making the film very much adult-friendly with references to 
older films and a classic television show. When an escape attempt fails, you 
see a character bouncing a ball against the wall and "The Great Escape" comes 
to mind. And when the farm's dim owner continuously spies on his 
fine-feathered animals and then insists to his wife "they are organizing" 
only for them to scatter into chaotic formations when she takes a gander, 
memories of "Bewitched" run free. Other references include, but surely aren't 
limited to, "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Shawshank Redemption," 
"Stalag 17" Charly Chaplin's "Modern Times" and none other than Mr. Gibson's 
"Braveheart."
In the time it takes to watch "The Patriot," you can see "Chicken Run" twice. 
This may not be such a bad idea. Although, if you insist on seeing the longer 
war epic, do so while the movie is still on the big screen as the broad 
cinematography and battle scenes require such size. And if you decide to do 
like I did and see "Chicken Run" first and then "The Patriot," please give 
enough time in between so that you aren't stuck with mental images of a 
chicken in the Revolutionary War. These birds of a feather clearly don't 
flock together.

In the tradition of Toy Story 2, Chicken Run is an animated movie for anyone 
and everyone. Not only do sharp wit, droll one-liners, and hidden inside 
jokes get marvelously packaged into one, Chicken Run is also a remarkable 
looking film. This is one of the few films made with stop motion animation, 
more commonly known as claymation. Veteran animation studio Aardman 
Animations, who created all three of the Wallace and Gromit shorts as well as 
the Academy Award winning short Creature Comforts is behind this movie. 
Director and Aardman head Nick Park (director of the three Wallace and Gromit 
shorts) brings the animals to life. The screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick does 
borrow heavily from several claymation and computer animated movies, but is 
full of brilliant humor. There is a perfect balance of jokes for adults and 
kids, and it's likely to please both audiences. 
Ginger is the ambitious leader of a group of hens. She focuses on getting the 
entire group out of Mrs. Tweedy's egg farm. Mrs. Tweedy is an evil individual 
with a dim-witted husband who always believes the chickens are organizing an 
escape. She ignores her spouse, and often gets angry with him and the 
minuscule profits she's making on the farm. Seeking more money, she orders a 
chicken pie machine and begins to fatten up the chickens. There may be hope 
for the chickens in their time of need though. Rocky the Rooster is a flying 
chicken from the circus. Through several misunderstandings and lies the hens 
believe he can teach them how to fly the coop, so to speak. In actuality, 
Rocky flies because he gets shot out of a cannon. However, he soon has the 
hens doing flying exercises and tries to get them to take off in the air. How 
much longer can he keep up the charade without the others finding out, before 
they all end up as pies?
The comic actions of these chickens as they deploy their genius escape plans 
are ineffable. Chicken Run is really a wonder to behold, a movie you really 
have to see for yourself. The jokes are that funny and unexpected. One of my 
favorite lines occurs when Rocky first meets the hens and tells them he's 
from America, the land of the free. This prompts Mac, the scientific and 
brainy chicken to say, "You mean Scotland!" Another highlight is a 
half-witted hen who views laying several eggs a day only to get killed later 
as a living. There's also two hilarious rats that try to sell a variety of 
small items (like a set of thimbles as a tea set or a shuttlecock as a 
two-way hat) to the flock. All the voices are excellent. Mel Gibson plays the 
perfect womanizing rooster, and Julia Sawalha and Lynn Ferguson are energetic 
and exciting in their roles.
For all of the little touches in Chicken Run, the main plot is rather 
derivative. Elements from all three Wallace and Gromit shorts appear. Another 
large chunk of this movie seems to be from the 1998 computer animated feature 
A Bug's Life. Many movies get spoofed, but just as many movies get copied 
from. The familiarity felt with scenes like Rocky and Ginger getting caught 
in the chicken pie machine (similar to Wallace and Gromit getting caught in a 
dog food machine) hurt my overall enjoyment of the movie. It felt like I'd 
seen this material before. A feeling not felt throughout the rest of the 
movie.
Every chicken in this movie acts like a human, that's one of its many charms. 
You will find people you know resembling these characters. Despite the human 
resemblance, the chickens are never stereotypes of human characters seen in 
other movies. This is a movie intended to get taken lightly. Never before has 
any animated movie kept me needing more like this one has. Chicken Run is 
pure fun that will delight all ages. The crazy antics are unparalleled from 
any other comedy this year. 
Will we be seeing a Chicken Run 2 in the near future? I sure hope so.

Like many of My Fellow Americans, my only real exposure to British
Humour has been through the occasional transplanted TV series made over
for an American audience, and through shows like BENNY HILL and
PRISONER: CELL BLOCK H (yes, I know it was Aussie, and a drama.  Hey,
work with me here).  All the more reason why I enjoyed CHICKEN RUN so
much: I didn't have the added burden of having the ready comparison to
its kin WALLACE AND GROMMIT or THE WRONG TROUSERS, for better or worse.
Without hesitation or excuse, I could (and did), in my Anglo-virgin
eyes, enjoy CHICKEN RUN for what it was.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Life on the farm is anything but fun for dese hea' chicks.
Tired of being cooped up for her purchase of eggs (and of living in fear
that the axe will fall the day that her egg-production days are over),
Ginger (Julia Sawahla) dreams of freedom Somewhere Out There, away from
her oppressors, evil chicken farmer Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) and
her henpecked husband Mr. Tweedy (Anthony Haygarth).  Ginger gets little
help from her fellow cacklers, featherbrained Babs (Jane Horrocks),
rough-and-tumble Bunty (Imelda Staunton), the scholarly Scotschick Mac
(Lynne Ferguson), or the old cock Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), since most
of them are caught up in the slave mentality that tells them they are
destined to live out their lives in captivity.  But Ginger ain't havin'
it; and with the help of packrats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil
Daniels), and Rocky (Mel Gibson), a cocky flying Rhode Island rooster
who falls out of the sky and into their roost, Ginger believes she and
her chick friends might soon gain their freedom after all...
CHICKEN RUN got the adult-to-children entertainment ratio right, even
moreso than TOY STORY 2 did--and TS2 was one of my top ten flicks of
1999, so you know that's saying a lot.   A good mix of clever allusions
to war flicks of the past (especially THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17),
plus quick nods to the likes of COOL HAND LUKE and Gibson's BRAVEHEART,
"Chicken" didn't forget to play for the kiddies as well--and it did so
without patronizing the children or insulting its older audience's
intelligence.  For every adult-type inside joke that went over the wee
tot's heads ("bend over and kiss your bum goodbye!"), there was a
message that could be easily grasped by the young ones.  Would that
DINOSAUR had been scripted by this team of folks; it might've been a
much different flick.
But that's too heavy a statement to make here.  The beauty of CHICKEN
RUN is that it was fun to watch, even with its non-bright colors (done
purposefully, I'd say, to denote a World War II-ish time period, as well
as the comparative bleakness of the setting).  In fact, not having seen
the aforementioned WALLACE AND GROMMIT yet (though I'll be remedying
that right soon, I reckon), I can easily compare it to another animated
favorite of mine, A BUG'S LIFE, in its attention to detail and
surrounding environment.  And, like "Bug" in its climax, "Chicken"
addresses the concept of teamwork, another good lesson for kids to take
away.   Not a shabby one for us adults either, come to think of it.
The animation technique used in CHICKEN RUN - claymation - worked
beautifully; there were only a few moments (primarily when the camera
was pulled back for a long shot) that the "drawings" seemed transparent
and the scene didn't look natural (as if a chicken with teeth, and hands
instead of wings, could possibly look natural).  Still, it was
head-and-shoulders above the schizo animation mix in TITAN A.E. with the
added benefit of looking less polished (and therefore, even more
believable) in its backgrounds.
But as good as the animation was, the voice characterizations were even
better; again, a welcome improvement over "Titan" and "Dinosaur" before
it.  Here, the characters were convincing in their chickdom (and let us
not forget about Nick and Fetcher's ratitude), and more important, the
actors seemed in-touch with their characters; they seemed to be having
fun with them.  From the sweet airheadedness of Jane Horrock as Babs
(her "How did you enjoy your Holiday?" as Ginger was brought back from
time in The Hole, had more sincerity in its English lilt than the same
line from an American Gen X actress could ever hope to deliver), to Phil
Daniels and Timothy Spall's delight in playing a couple'a rats, to Lynne
Ferguson's Mac and her playful nod to Scotty of STAR TREK fame, Julia
Sawahla's dogged determination as Ginger, and the overall image of
chickens running around like their heads were cut off - the actors and
their characters almost all worked for me.
Especially, much to my surprise, Mel Gibson.  After his mugging of the
camera in "Lethal Weapon"s 2, 3, and 4, I was ready to write off his
cute butt as one of those grossly overpaid movie stars who have more
money than talent.  As much as the producers balked at an American
"stealing the show" (it's been reported that the production team
insisted that the Yankee Rocky not be the hero here), that's exactly
what happened in any scene where Gibson laid on his considerable charms
as cocky Rocky.  It wasn't so much that the other actors were
lacking--they weren't--but Gibson just shined a wee bit brighter than
the rest, and most surprising of all, he didn't work that last nerve in
doing so.  But on the other end of the spectrum was Miranda Richardson
as Mrs. Tweedy; I know Richardson has the stuff of a good actress, but
in "Chicken", I just wasn't feelin' her.  Here, she was not only mean
enough, she also wasn't given enough lines, making her character seem
more a supporting player than the lead the story suggested.  A minor
quibble, to say the least; even at its worst, CHICKEN RUN just daggone
fun to watch.
The one head-scratcher I came away with was the attitude of the chickens
to their eggs.  One has to wonder if these chickens grasped the "where
do little chickens come from, mommy?" concept.  This, however, was
counterbalanced by the snicker-funny "which came first?" discussion
between rats Nick and Fetcher--which reminds me to remind you: never
leave an animated movie before the credits are over, or you might miss
something "special".
CHICKEN RUN is one of those flicks I look forward to seeing multiple
times with different age groups, to see the different vibes folks of all
ages get from it.  Can't wait to see it with my young cousins--and with
my mother.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
A clever, funny flick with a good sense of Brit style, and a
surprisingly good (without being overbearingly cloying) vocal
performance by Mel Gibson.  Claymation sure has come a long way since
"The California Raisins", eh?
CHICKEN RUN (rating: greenlight):
Now, who's up for a 2-piece and a biscuit?

Every once in a while filmmakers make major breakthroughs.  In 1995 with
TOY STORY, Pixar showed us what is possible when stellar computer
animation is combined with an equally bright script.  This year it's
DreamWorks' turn as they take clay animation to heights that you would
never think possible and come up with a screenplay that's truly worthy
of the visuals -- something that Disney failed miserably on recently
with DINOSAURS.
In CHICKEN RUN, a chicken-coop-as-concentration-camp tale, DreamWorks
takes the animation crown from Pixar.  They've raised the stakes.  It's
time for Pixar to come up with something as innovative as CHICKEN RUN to
regain the title.  For now, DreamWorks rules, and CHICKEN RUN is king.
In the "Hogan's Heroes" world of the Tweedy Egg Farm, every day is a
good day to try to make the big escape.  And each episode has the birds
failing spectacularly and humorously.  Led by the inexorable Ginger
(Julia Sawalha), who keeps getting thrown into solitary confinement (the
trash bin), the chickens boldly embark on one foolhardy mission after
another.  They live in a produce-or-perish world.  If any come up a few
eggs short, Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) shows up with an axe and
leads them away.  The silliest of the chickens assume that the missing
ones have gone on vacation.  (Actually the script should have said "on
holiday" since all of the characters, save one, are British.)
The movie, which is worth many viewings, takes great care with all of
the details.  The lighting varies from an ominously dark nighttime, when
the escapes are planned, to bright sunshine when the animals try to get
in shape -- more on that later.
The modeling of every character is a complete delight.  My favorites are
the beady eyes, but the large, expressive mouths with the big, clunky
teeth would be a close second.  But then again, their plump torsos are
pretty funny too.
One day to this land of brave losers comes possible salvation in the
form of an American, Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson).  Rocky, who claims
to be known as the "Lone Range Rooster," is a braggart and a bit of a
scam artist.  But since he flew into the chicken coop, the chickens
figure he can teach them to fly out.  Leading them in hilarious daily
calisthenics, he tries, without noticeable success, to work them into
flying shape.
Among the many wonderful supporting characters is a feisty old codger
named Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow).  Fowler, a veteran of the RAF, is a
rooster who likes to begin his thoughts with "Back in my day, ..."  He
doesn't think much of Rocky, remarking, "Pushy Americans, always showing
up late for every war."
Their daily routine of escape and capture comes to a halt when Mrs.
Tweedy discovers a pamphlet in her mail entitled "Sick and Tired of
Making Miniscule Profits?"  This causes her to import a diabolical
machine, which forces the chickens to escalate their training.  "Pain is
your friend," Rocky tells his plump pupils as they almost faint from
exhaustion.  "It's a positive thing."  Eventually, the barnyard
dissolves into some of the funniest gallows humor in years.
This rousing good tale is up-beat but never saccharine.  With enough
poignant moments to make the humor work even better and to endear the
characters to us, the movie is a completely satisfying and magical
experience for young and old.  Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park, who
also provided the story, and writers Karey Kirkpatrick and Jack
Rosenthal clearly have poured their hearts and souls into the movie's
production with magnificent results.
The story is at its best when poking fun at the chicken's foolish
bravado.  "We'll die freeing chickens, or we'll die trying!" Ginger
boldly proclaims.  "Are these the only choices?" asks one of her timid
followers.

Reviewed on June 27th, 2000.
"Chicken Run" is the first full-length feature from Nick Park, creator of 
the popular "Wallace And Gromit" series of short films. Like those 
movies, "Chicken Run" is done entirely in the Claymation style of 
animation (albeit far more advanced than those old Rankin-Bass Christmas 
specials from the Sixties that crop up on TV every December), and 
features a primarily British cast and setting. The result is a lovely 
family film, one which is sure to have tremendous appeal for the children 
while keeping the grown-ups quietly amused, as well.
The Tweedy Chicken Farm is home to hundreds of imprisoned chickens. Some, 
like Bunty (Imelda Staunton), RAF veteran Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) and 
dimwitted Babs (Jane Horrocks) seem to accept their situation. Others, 
like the feisty Ginger (Julia Sawalha from "Absolutely Fabulous") and 
scientific Mac (Lynn Ferguson) are determined to escape. To this end, 
they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but 
every time, they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish Mr Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth). Observes Ginger, it's not enough that just one or two 
chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the Tweedys.
Then one day, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a smooth-talking flying rooster 
from America, lands in the chicken coop with an injured wing. He claims 
he can teach the chickens to fly, igniting Ginger's hopes and dreams one 
more time. But the chickens' mission is given new urgency when 
profit-minded Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), tired of making 
chickenfeed (excuse the pun) selling eggs, purchases a fearsome new 
pie-making machine. "Chickens go in, pies come out," she declares. 
"Oooh," says Mr Tweedy, "what kind of pies?"
Visually, "Chicken Run" is a treat. It doesn't possess the same kind of 
awe-inspiring cinematography as the summer's previous kid-oriented 
picture, "Dinosaur", but rather allows the viewer to feast upon the 
details of its every frame. There's a lot going on in each scene of 
"Chicken Run", and I was particularly impressed by how so many of the 
Claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms, like Babs' constant 
knitting. Claymation is a very different, more tactile style of animation 
than hand-drawn or computerised cartoons, giving the events an extra 
layer of reality, no matter how outlandish the goings-on.
This is particularly effective in scenes like one where Rocky and Ginger 
are trapped in the bowels of the pie machine. The dangers are still 
comical but they feel more real, and the entire voyage through the 
contraption is all the more fascinating because of it. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the movie's outstanding climax, a more thrilling and 
inventive ending than most films so far this year. You'll believe a 
chicken can fly... as it were.
The voicework is generally accomplished, particularly amongst the British 
cast: Mel Gibson does a fine job as Rocky, but he's clearly just playing 
a skewed version of his own public image here. The other artistes give 
their characters more personality, and as a result chickens like Ginger 
and Fowler come across as better-rounded individuals. Indeed, the animals 
of "Chicken Run" are by and large more interesting than the humans in most 
other movies this summer! Richardson, meanwhile, finds just the right 
note as the fiendish but not too-exaggerated Mrs Tweedy. And Horrocks is 
perhaps best of all as the simple-minded, put-upon Mr Tweedy, who is the 
only one aware that the chickens are plotting an escape ("The chickens -- 
they've organised!" he protests to his disbelieving wife).
As a comedy, "Chicken Run" is funny, but I suspect children will get more 
laughs out of it than adults. Certainly, I found the movie made me just 
smile more often than outright guffaw. That said, there are definitely 
elements intended for both age groups, and the screenplay by Karey 
Kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get
-- the chickens meet in Hut 17, for example, a sly reference to the World 
War II internment movie "Stalag 17", starring William Holden. Viewers 
should particularly keep an eye out for the cleverly-named Nick and 
Fetcher (Timothy Spall from "Topsy-Turvy" and Phil Daniels), two rats who 
supply the chickens with merchandise -- for a price. This pair forms a 
hilarious double act, and steal virtually every scene they're in. Be sure 
to stick around for their post-credits conversation.
"Chicken Run" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being 
particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across. 
There's a lot of good stuff here, about teamwork and never giving up, but 
Kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point. He trusts that his audience is 
intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves; I wish 
other movies had this kind of faith.
Parents will also be glad to learn that, content-wise, "Chicken Run" 
should be suitable for just about any age. There are scenes of suspense 
(like the aforementioned journey through the pie machine), but these are 
tempered with a lot of humor and shouldn't prove notably frightening. 
Even scenes depicting the stark reality of the chicken farm -- a chicken 
who can no longer lay eggs is beheaded and cooked for dinner by the 
Tweedys, for instance -- are handled in a careful manner that gets 
the idea across without being unnecessarily traumatising.
"Chicken Run" is just what the box office needed amongst the tidal wave of 
big-budget summer actions flicks: a good-natured, funny movie that pretty 
much anyone can enjoy. Well-written, well-acted and certainly well-made, 
"Chicken Run" may by the best family movie this year.

I can't imagine this film not being a major summer success with kids of all
ages. In fact, I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie a whole lot,
girls, guys, kids, teens and adults alike. For Dreamworks, this film could
easily be the start of a major franchise, with plenty of sequels and
merchandising opportunities yet to come. I will also be the first to admit
that the trailer for this film didn't really turn me on, but once this film
got going, I was hooked, line and sinker. The movie is simply cluckolicious
(sorry, but I couldn't go an entire review without using one stupid chicken
pun...it was just too easy).
PLOT:
A bunch of British hens laying eggs in a chicken farm for a living decide
that it's time to escape their inevitable fates. They organize several
attempts of flight from their coops, but none turn out successful. Just
then, an outside American rooster pops into their lives and raises their
hopes of escape.
CRITIQUE:
A cluckin' good time! A wonderful production featuring impeccable clay
animation effects, a witty and original script, an infectious and booming
score, and the cutest l'il chickens you'd ever want to meet. Chicken has
always been my favorite of the "white meats", but after seeing this movie, I
may have to reconsider ever eating chicken again. They're just so cute and
cuddly! Seriously though, the film is a delight on so many different levels.
It's fun to look at, it's loaded with many funny one-liners, it moves along
at a hardy pace, and overall, it just makes you smile and love movies so
much more. It's also short and sweet, which is always welcome in so-called
"children's movies". The audience I was with seemed to love the film even
more than I did, with many of the attendees laughing out loud on several
occasions. I personally enjoyed much of the film's smart humor, but mostly I
just chuckled and smiled a lot. The British hen accents were also a very
cool and pleasant addition, as well as the hip turn by Rocky the Rooster,
perfectly voiced over by none other than mega-star Mel Gibson.
Any major problems with the film? Not really. Perhaps the addition of a
couple of snappy songs might've added to the proceedings, but any film
featuring a boisterous chicken dance sequence as well as an all-out muddy
cockfight, certainly has enough filling on its plate as it is. I also loved
the movie's many prominent homage scenarios, including the film to which
this one derives its most obvious influence, THE GREAT ESCAPE (just replace
the humans in that movie with chickens). There are also a couple of really
cool action sequences, one reminiscent of INDIANA JONES, and the other
bringing to mind the last 20 minutes of TOY STORY 2 (8/10), two films which
certainly aren't chicken feed on their own right. And if you really pay
close attention, you will note a famous shot from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
done with a chicken standing in the rain here. Pretty funny. I don't like
making predictions either, but this film certainly could be one of the
biggest hits of the summer (a sleeper, some might say), simply because of
its ability to hit many of the tones that people look for in a quality
movie. It's got a great look, a rousing score, plenty of goofs, inside
pranks, emotional scenes, a touch of romance, action, adventure, memorable
characters and just an overall solid feeling of chicken-loving-fun. So drop
the chicken wings, grab the kids, tow the better half along, and prepare
yourself to be entertained for 85 minutes of cluckin' fun!
And who can't love those darn chicken teeth!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
How meticulous is this kind of movie-making? Picture this: There are 24
frames per second of film time, so depending on the action in a sequence of
film time, it is possible to have 24 separate poses to shoot per character
for every second in a scene, each pose involving the tiniest increment of
movement for body, head, arms, legs, hands, fingers, eyes, mouth, clothing
and more. Multiply that by every character in every scene, adding in the
movement of any props that are also on camera, and you begin to get the
picture.
Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park are the Academy Award-winning team behind
the popular Wallace & Gromit shorts. This film needed a total of 40
animators, split into two teams and guided by the two directors. Peter also
had a hand in creating the innovative "Sledgehammer" music video by Peter
Gabriel.
Julia Sawalha, the voice of the lead hen Ginger in this film, is probably
best known for her starring role on the BBC comedy series "Absolutely
Fabulous".
This film was previously known as C:R-1 (a sign of a sequel perhaps?).

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member James Brundage.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/26d2b7f0e671d82188256902000457dc?OpenDocument
Since the beginning of time (or at least the domestication of animals),
the chicken has been man's feathered enigma.  Like so many of its
feathered friends, it has fallen into the realm of the metaphor (i.e.
`He's a chicken.').  Unlike so many of its edible counterparts, it has
survived the hassles of religious communities unscathed (no one will
persecute you for eating a chicken wing).  It has found its way into the
realm of ontological questions (which came first: the chicken or the
egg), as well as into sanguine curiosity (why does a chicken continue
moving around after you cut its head off).  It has become the basic
standard for all foods (taste's like chicken).  It has changed with the
times, entering the debate about genetic engineering (see the
accusations against KFC using frank-n-roosters).  It has even, through
its progeny, entered into the world of our children (I do not like green
eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am).  As long as civilization has
existed, the chicken has haunted our collective hubris with its
often-charming idiocy.
Amongst both edible entrees and feathered friends, the chicken is the
idiot God
In fact, let's admit it: there's NOTHING interesting about chickens.
Even at a petting zoo, your four year old would rather take the chance
of having his shirt chewed up or being spit upon by a lama than bother
at all with the chicken.  These dumb animals simply run away whenever
you get more than five feet from them and, after those few minutes of
chasing chickens at the petting zoo when you are in your younger years,
your fascination with chickendom cracks like an egg broken for the
omelet.  So even after seeing Peter Lord and Nick Park's feature debut,
Chicken Run  by far the single smartest family animation feature I have
seen since Toy Story  I still wonder what the hell enticed these guys
into crafting a story about chickens in the first place.
I don't know why they did it, and I probably never will.  All I know is
that I am glad that they did.
Chicken Run, a version of The Great Escape with Ginger (Julia Swalath)
taking over the part of Steve McQueen, tells the story of a farm full of
chickens at the Audubon-Auswitzch of the Tweedy egg farm.  At the Tweedy
egg farm, things are fairly routine try to escape when you can and lay
your eggs, or it's off to the chopping block for you.  Ginger doesn't
like this life, and dreams of living anywhere outside of the farm.  Baba
(Jane Horrocks) is a complete lemming and has no trouble following
anyone, but believes that whenever Ginger is put in solitary confinement
(the trash can) she is on holiday.  Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), a former
RAF rooster, reminisces about the good old days of fighting Jerry.
Meanwhile, inside of the farm, Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) focuses
herself on transforming the slave labor camp into a full-blown death
camp (by use of a pie machine) while Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) tries
(and fails) to outsmart the chickens.  Everything continues along said
routine until Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson) arrives, having
accidentally hit the weathervane on a misfire from the circus.  His
arrival gets Ginger cooking, and pretty soon she lays the golden egg
that may lead to freedom from the farm they will fly out.
Numerous attempts to do this fail, laughs ensue, and the movie speeds
along at a chipper pace towards a conclusion that makes the rocket
sequence in Toy Story look like child's play.
Chicken Run's main strength as a family film comes in its ability to
seamlessly meld humor that can pander to the children and not go under
adult heads and give more intellectual parodies to adults that will
still seem funny to children, and it does this by always being aware of
just how bizarre a version of The Great Escape with poultry in it really
is (i.e. the advertised line `I don't want to be a pie' is followed by
`I don't even like gravy.').
In the realm of claymation, Chicken Run finds itself only in the company
of itself and other Oscar nominees.  1999's Humdrum (Peter Lord and Nick
Park's Oscar-nominated short), in which shadow puppets played with
shadow puppets, had the same level of detail in character animation,
whereas 1998's More (Mark Osborne's (Dropping Out) Oscar-nominated
short) featured the same level of detail in claymation sets and
lighting.  However, Chicken Run marks the first time near-perfection in
both arenas has come together to form near-perfect claymation it raises
the bar for the genre as a whole.
Of course realistic animation isn't the point with claymation, so don't
expect Chicken Run's chickens to look like the ones you pick up at the
store: therein lies the source of their charm.  While the average
chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck, this film's
chickens are well-defined characters that make you laugh, feel worry for
them, and then laugh even more.
All that, and you only get one `chicken and the egg' joke.

CAST: Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Lynn Ferguson, Miranda Richardson, Tony Haygarth
Dream Works is back! This time with a brilliant animated feature that
might very well be the comedy of the year. From the its first shot,
when a "chicken-ghetto" is shown, lit up by the pale moon, you'll
start chuckling. And when Mel Gibson's (Braveheart) Rocky flies over
it, screaming "FREEDOM", you'll be laughing so hard that you'll get a
nosebleed. The reason for that 'Chicken Run' is so successful is that
the talented Park and Lord found a perfect balance between drama,
satire and comedy. It is much more demanding and intelligent than most
of the stereotype cartoons produced by Disney evey year, and a lot
funnier than Disney's mega-hit "Toy Story 2".
The setting is the Tweedy's, a dank little chicken farm in Yorkshire,
England, populated mostly by hens and a few old roosters who are
living on borrowed time, slowly awaiting their doom. They are under
the mercy of Mrs. Tweedy, a Nazilike woman (voiced by Miranda
Richardson), who demands nothing less than productivity from her
prisoners in the form of eggs and more eggs. But even when her hens
lay eggs at a high rate, it isn't enough for her. The chickens are
helpless, slowly awaiting their doom. Some know, some suspect and
others do not believe it. Only Ginger, a determined feisty hen with a
temper, is trying to escape. She dreams of wild open spaces, freedom
and release from fear. There doesn't go a day by, without her trying
and failing in her escape. But soon she realizes that there is no way
of getting of this farm alive. But everything changes when an upstart
Yank literally falls into the hens' midst. Rocky the Flying Rooster,
the self-described "lone free-ranger," has made his living being shot
from a cannon at a circus. On the lam from his owner, Rocky takes
convenient refuge on the farm and does nothing to discourage the idea
that he can fly, which allows Ginger to pin all her hopes for a mass
escape on Rocky's teaching the girls how to get airborne. At the same
time, however, Mrs. Tweedy, fed up with the "minuscule profits" from
eggs, decides to build a terrible pie-making machine, which works very
simple -- "chickens come in, pies come out". Soon a dark smoke is
forcing itself from old pipes....
 The confining, prison-like setting, which is rarely left during the
film, seems to have placed a sort of dramatic straitjacket on the
filmmakers' impulse for nifty side trips and surprising
digressions. It is a rather risky attempt to paradise the World War II
prison camp thrillers. "Chicken Run" is a holocaust movie about, well,
chickens. It's a very smart film, very alert, but it's also incredibly
dark film - an allegory disguised as a cartoon that comments on, among
other things, our dog-eat-dog society, greed, ruthlessness and
cruelty. The characters, all chickens, are jailed, exploited and
tortured by humans if they don't cooperate - and are sent to the ovens
if they don't reach the daily quota of eggs.
Everything second of what you see on screen is many days of hard
work. Every element is made of Plasticine, which means that the
directors had to move the figures manually for every little
movement. And since there are 24 movements per second, you can imagine
why this film took such a long time to complete. This technique is
very demanding, but it gives the directors complete control. Because
of that there are no accidents, mistakes or surprises during the
production. The good thing is that the enormous efforts have paid
off. Everything is perfect. The figures look like as they have been
made by children - sweet, cartoonish and innocent. The small details
in "set decoration" are incredible. Like 'Antz', 'Chicken Run' is a
film that plays on several levels, and the more you know about
history, films and politics, the more will you enjoy the film. But as
it showed out 'Antz' was more appreciated by adults, rather than
children. 'Chicken Run' on the other hand, despite of its darker
tones, isn't that heavy and thus offers an equal amount of quality
entertainment for children as well as adults. The dialogue is wisely
structured, with incredibly amusing characters and brilliant parodies
on famous Hollywood productions, that are elegantly floating into each
other, creating a bright, comic cocktail.
To be sure, "Chicken Run" is always engaging, full of bright humor,
marvelous stop-motion work with Plasticine figures, dramatic conflict
and wonderfully nuanced characterizations. Indeed, the leading
characters are given unusually fine shadings for animated creations,
which is partly a tribute to the Aardman team's finesse and partly due
to the outstanding casting and performances. Mel Gibson delivers an
energetic at times self ironic performance, and of course "Braveheart"
is not excluded. The rest of the cast consists of marvelous actors,
such as Julia Sawalha and ______ as the proud, elderly chicken
general. With their clipped British voices, the hens are like women in
a World War II POW flick (Glenn Close's recent "Paradise Road" comes
to mind). The Tweedy farm looking like something out of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" (1993), with chicken coops resembling
bunkers and fencing topped with barbed wire. Before our disbelieving
eyes, a pageant of jeopardy, romance and rescue unfolds. Chickens
yelling, "She's gonna blow," chickens jitter-bugging to the classic
"Flip Flop and Fly," chickens creating the kind of rousing action
finale John Woo would relish. The film is funny, without trying too
hard and emotional, without over dramatizing. It's the example of a
perfect film, that should be followed by the producers and directors
of Walt Disney Pictures. I simply can't imagine someone not enjoying
this film. It offers more than enough for any audience member. And let
me put it even more strait -- it's enough to become a vegetarian...for
life!

Running Time: 85 minutes
Sometimes there are animated wonders. The year 1999 had the amazing "Toy 
Story 2", 1998 had the classic "Mulan", and going all the way back to the 
original "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" animation has come a long way. 
However let's not get on the subject of Disney films, but rather Dreamworks 
Animated Movies, whose films include 1998's "The Prince of Egypt", and 2000's 
flop "The Road to El Dorado" has now come out with a new instant classic 
"Chicken Run", a brilliant, funny well animated movie that is worthy of all 
the praise it can get.
Taking place in the 1950's, "Chicken Run" is about a big group of chickens, 
whose farm they live on belonging to the Tweedy's is a bit like a Poultry 
Holocaust setting, they try and try their hardest to get out of this pin, 
because if they do not lay eggs anymore, they die and become friend chicken. 
The main character Ginger (Julia Swalha) is the young chicken who is the one 
that is destined to get out and try if her tries fail. She tries many times, 
but is locked away in a dumpster for a few days to return back to the pin and 
do it all over again. One day a gift from heaven comes, the suave Rocky the 
Rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) who literally flies over their pin, saves the 
day by trying to teach the girls how to fly out of this coop. 
However Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy have something else on their minds, and the 
chickens must get out of the pin and escape or die frying. Along the way they 
have some hilarious misadventures, with sweet and clever dialogue and very 
well developed characters for chickens that is. The voices also are a 
standout with Julia Sawalha being the best out of all of them. She brings out 
her voice and makes it full force as well as hilarious. The supporting 
chickens are funny as well, that at times had me rolling so hard. Mel Gibson 
is a great voice too and fits Rocky the Rooster quite well. Miranda 
Richardson does the spooky character voice for Mrs. Tweedy and sounds very 
nice, as well as mean. Tony Haygarth plays the cowardly Mr. Tweedy who really 
isn't as mean as Mrs. Tweedy is.
The animation on the film is beyond amazing, the claymation used in this film 
is colorful, brilliant and fantastically done. You can really tell in some 
scenes that alot of work (3 years) was put into this film. In the end, 
however it shows wonderfully. The movement of these chickens is smooth and 
makes those old Gumby episodes look like mush. Even with Disneys $200m flop 
'Dinosaur' I would have to pick 'Chicken Run' as having the best animation so 
far this year, not because of the fact that its animated, but because of the 
fact of all the work that was put into this film in the past three years and 
$42 million dollars later. 
The film a wonderful children's movie that kids will sit and enjoy, laugh at 
and be entertained by. Its direction, voices and story are so brought out 
well, that this may be one of the best animated films I've seen. It is 
certainly one of the best films of 2000. There really isn't any flaws in the 
film, which is a rare occasion in Hollywood these days. Last year we had 
"American Beauty" another Dreamworks film, and in 1998 we had "Saving Private 
Ryan" yet another Dreamworks film. If this is the case, I hope Dreamworks 
puts out more films like "Chicken Run". Because as long as they do I will 
certainly be there to watch them.

Every once in a while a so-called children's movie comes along that's NOT 
some wicked preachy/ goofy
musical/promotion for a line of toys and video games. That's what "Chicken 
Run" is - a beautifully
animated lighthearted comedy that will pretty much be considered a kid's 
movie but you don't have to be
eight years old to like it. 
Instead of employing computer animation this movie instead uses the seemingly 
forgotten art of
claymation. Not that there's anything wrong with cartoon and computer 
animation but this gives the film a
refreshing appeal in today's movie market. 
The story revolves around a large group of chickens on an egg farm in 
England. The story is told from the
chickens' point of view so of course we sympathize with their plight of 
trying to escape. They are lead by
Ginger, who dreams of freedom but whose repeated escape attempts always fail. 
One day an American
rooster named Rockey Rhodes ends up in the pen with them and claims he can 
teach them to fly out of
there. 
For the most part, the "story" is predictable, but the way it's told has such 
a smooth style it's very
enjoyable. There's a lot of comedy here, both the generic slapstick but 
there's a lot of layers to satire that
appear upon closer inspection. It's not the most thematic movie ever made, 
but there's nothing wrong with
it either.

Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick,
from a story by Lord and Park. Starring Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson,
Miranda Richardson. Running time: 84 minutes. Rated G by the MFCB.
Reviewed on June 27th, 2000.
"Chicken Run" is the first full-length feature from Nick Park, creator of 
the popular "Wallace And Gromit" series of short films. Like those 
movies, "Chicken Run" is done entirely in the Claymation style of 
animation (albeit far more advanced than those old Rankin-Bass Christmas 
specials from the Sixties that crop up on TV every December), and 
features a primarily British cast and setting. The result is a lovely 
family film, one which is sure to have tremendous appeal for the children 
while keeping the grown-ups quietly amused, as well.
The Tweedy Chicken Farm is home to hundreds of imprisoned chickens. Some, 
like Bunty (Imelda Staunton), RAF veteran Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) and 
dimwitted Babs (Jane Horrocks) seem to accept their situation. Others, 
like the feisty Ginger (Julia Sawalha from "Absolutely Fabulous") and 
scientific Mac (Lynn Ferguson) are determined to escape. To this end, 
they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but 
every time, they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish Mr Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth). Observes Ginger, it's not enough that just one or two 
chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the Tweedys.
Then one day, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a smooth-talking flying rooster 
from America, lands in the chicken coop with an injured wing. He claims 
he can teach the chickens to fly, igniting Ginger's hopes and dreams one 
more time. But the chickens' mission is given new urgency when 
profit-minded Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), tired of making 
chickenfeed (excuse the pun) selling eggs, purchases a fearsome new 
pie-making machine. "Chickens go in, pies come out," she declares. 
"Oooh," says Mr Tweedy, "what kind of pies?"
Visually, "Chicken Run" is a treat. It doesn't possess the same kind of 
awe-inspiring cinematography as the summer's previous kid-oriented 
picture, "Dinosaur", but rather allows the viewer to feast upon the 
details of its every frame. There's a lot going on in each scene of 
"Chicken Run", and I was particularly impressed by how so many of the 
Claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms, like Babs' constant 
knitting. Claymation is a very different, more tactile style of animation 
than hand-drawn or computerised cartoons, giving the events an extra 
layer of reality, no matter how outlandish the goings-on.
This is particularly effective in scenes like one where Rocky and Ginger 
are trapped in the bowels of the pie machine. The dangers are still 
comical but they feel more real, and the entire voyage through the 
contraption is all the more fascinating because of it. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the movie's outstanding climax, a more thrilling and 
inventive ending than most films so far this year. You'll believe a 
chicken can fly... as it were.
The voicework is generally accomplished, particularly amongst the British 
cast: Mel Gibson does a fine job as Rocky, but he's clearly just playing 
a skewed version of his own public image here. The other artistes give 
their characters more personality, and as a result chickens like Ginger 
and Fowler come across as better-rounded individuals. Indeed, the animals 
of "Chicken Run" are by and large more interesting than the humans in most 
other movies this summer! Richardson, meanwhile, finds just the right 
note as the fiendish but not too-exaggerated Mrs Tweedy. And Horrocks is 
perhaps best of all as the simple-minded, put-upon Mr Tweedy, who is the 
only one aware that the chickens are plotting an escape ("The chickens -- 
they've organised!" he protests to his disbelieving wife).
As a comedy, "Chicken Run" is funny, but I suspect children will get more 
laughs out of it than adults. Certainly, I found the movie made me just 
smile more often than outright guffaw. That said, there are definitely 
elements intended for both age groups, and the screenplay by Karey 
Kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get
-- the chickens meet in Hut 17, for example, a sly reference to the World 
War II internment movie "Stalag 17", starring William Holden. Viewers 
should particularly keep an eye out for the cleverly-named Nick and 
Fetcher (Timothy Spall from "Topsy-Turvy" and Phil Daniels), two rats who 
supply the chickens with merchandise -- for a price. This pair forms a 
hilarious double act, and steal virtually every scene they're in. Be sure 
to stick around for their post-credits conversation.
"Chicken Run" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being 
particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across. 
There's a lot of good stuff here, about teamwork and never giving up, but 
Kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point. He trusts that his audience is 
intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves; I wish 
other movies had this kind of faith.
Parents will also be glad to learn that, content-wise, "Chicken Run" 
should be suitable for just about any age. There are scenes of suspense 
(like the aforementioned journey through the pie machine), but these are 
tempered with a lot of humor and shouldn't prove notably frightening. 
Even scenes depicting the stark reality of the chicken farm -- a chicken 
who can no longer lay eggs is beheaded and cooked for dinner by the 
Tweedys, for instance -- are handled in a careful manner that gets 
the idea across without being unnecessarily traumatising.
"Chicken Run" is just what the box office needed amongst the tidal wave of 
big-budget summer actions flicks: a good-natured, funny movie that pretty 
much anyone can enjoy. Well-written, well-acted and certainly well-made, 
"Chicken Run" may by the best family movie this year.

Written by: Peter Lord, Nick Park, Karey Kirkpatrick
The chickens of Tweedy's farm are plotting an escape. They're tired of lives 
filled with nothing but laying as many eggs as possible or being sent to the 
chopping block. One courageous chicken, Ginger (Julia Sawalha), leads the 
group against the evil Mrs. Tweedy (The excellent Miranda Richardson) and 
the clueless Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth). What Ginger lacks in brilliant 
escape plans she makes up for in sheer determination. Unfortunately, Mrs. 
Tweedy has grown tired of the low income from selling eggs and has bought a 
massive pie making machine ("look at the size of that thing!" one character 
says in a nice little "Star Wars" homage). As Mrs. Tweedy says, "Chickens go 
in, pies come out." The chickens grow more and more desperate to escape, but 
all their plans seem to lead to Ginger being tossed in "the hole". Things 
are looking bleak until Rocky, the flying rooster (Mel Gibson), shows up. 
Ginger offers him sanctuary in return for him teaching all the chickens how 
to fly, so they can escape over the fence to freedom. Of course the one 
major problem with this plan is that chickens (and roosters) can't fly. This 
doesn't stop the group from trying, and what follows is a great claymation 
chicken version of "The Great Escape" (how's that for different?).
Okay, I know what everyone's thinking - how good can a goofy looking movie 
about claymation chickens possibly be? That's exactly what I was thinking 
walking into the theater. To say I was shocked by how much I enjoyed 
"Chicken Run" would be an understatement. I was completely bowled over by 
how much I loved this movie - with everything from the eccentric characters 
to the great soundtrack and voice-overs. The one and only complaint I had, 
and the only thing that kept the film from a full five star rating, was that 
Lord and Park (of "Wallace and Gromit" fame) allow the film to get a bit too 
cutesy at times. However, this is a minor complaint about an otherwise great 
movie. "Chicken Run" is the kind of movie Disney used to be able to make: a 
film with a perfect blend of childish humor and subtle jokes for the adults. 
These days Disney grants us movies like "Dinosaur" which look amazing but 
are aimed entirely at little ones. "Chicken Run" may not look amazing, since 
we've all seen claymation a thousand times over, but it's far more endearing 
than "Dinosaur" could ever have hoped to be.
The movie's strongest point is the host of delightfully bizarre characters 
(this was the strong point in "The Big Lebowski" too, and look what a great 
movie that was). Rocky could have been your typical heroic seeming phony, 
but those characters are usually all show on the outside and nothing on the 
inside. Rocky, on the other hand, is very little on the outside (he still 
acts like a chicken) and a lot on the inside. Gibson's voice-over is 
pleasant, but he doesn't add as much to his character as the English actors 
do to theirs. Julia Sawalha turns Ginger into a hilariously manic character, 
who always has a smile plastered to her face (actually, most of the chickens 
are always smiling) and spouts lines like, "We'll die free chickens, or 
we'll die trying!" The real standout performances (so to speak) come from 
two of the supporting cast members: Miranda Richardson ("Sleepy Hollow") as 
the evil Mrs. Tweedy, and Jane Horrocks ("Memphis Belle") as the hysterical 
chicken, Babs. Miranda Richardson, who I've always found to be a wonderful 
actress since I first saw her as Queen Elizabeth in the "Blackadder" British 
comedy series, isn't used as much as I would have liked in "Chicken Run", 
but she's delightful when present. Jane Horrocks' character, the overweight, 
flighty (pardon the pun), slightly neurotic Babs is uproariously funny. She 
has a grin constantly plastered to her face and a sewing kit stuck in her 
hands. She also gets some of the film's best lines like: "Me life flashed 
before me eyes... that was really boring."
I think one of the things I found so endearing about "Chicken Run" was that 
the characters may have acted like typical heroes at times, but they were 
still chickens at heart. Rocky may be all bravado in front of the chickens, 
but whenever a human comes close to him he starts screaming for Ginger to 
hide him. Another great scene like this is where one of the lead chickens 
tries to give her flock courage by saying, "The important thing is not to 
panic." The chickens immediately react by screeching and running around in 
circles. The film's other high points include a great, if slightly underused 
soundtrack; some delightfully over-the-top action sequences (watch for 
Ginger and Rocky's run in with the pie making machine); and more movie 
references than I could count ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The 
Great Escape" just to name a few). To top all this off, the movie runs only 
84 minutes in a time when movies running less than 120 are becoming scarce. 
I'd recommend "Chicken Run" to anyone who likes slightly childish comedies 
and give it a well earned four and a half out of five stars.

"Chicken Run," a fanciful tale about chickens
desperate to escape captivity, is innovative and
clever and is one of the most unique looking films
this year.  On the Tweedy Chicken Farm, life is cruel
and laborious.  These chickens live in a setting
that's reminiscent of a World War II concentration
camp.  The ground is muddied, the area is encircled by
barbed wire, and the perimeter is constantly patrolled
by Mr. Tweedy (voiced by Tony Haygarth) and his two
snarling guard dogs.  Worse, the bitter Mrs. Tweedy
(voiced by Miranda Richardson) oversees the farm.  She
closely examines her production report every week. 
And, if a chicken doesn't lay enough eggs, she takes
the underachiever to the chopping block.  
Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha), the plucky leader,
knows that they'll all meet the same fate sooner or
later.  She moons about freedom and the feeling of
lush grass under her three-toed feet.  She presses
everyone to think about escape.  But all attempts,
which include using a spoon to dig under a fence and
using an eggbeater to drill a tunnel, meet with
failure.  Of course, she could probably escape on her
own.  But the trick is to rescue the entire lot. 
That's no small feat, but these concepts of
selflessness, charity and teamwork are the
underpinnings that make this a heartwarming film.
Ginger's prayers may be answered when Rocky Rooster
(voiced by Mel Gibson) lands in the chicken farm.  She
marvels at his ability to 'fly' and believes that
flight offers the best chance of escape.  She hopes
that he'll teach them but finds it difficult to
establish a working relationship with the cocky
rooster.  He seems more interested in socializing and
boasting and is reluctant to help.  However, after
considerable duress, Rocky agrees to Ginger's request.
The ensuing sequences are hilarious as the chickens
engage in calisthenics, practice martial arts, and
attempt to fly by leaping off rooftops.  But lack of
progress begins to arouse the suspicion of some
others.  Ginger, however, clings on to hope.  "The
chances of us escaping are a million to one," says one
of the demoralized flock.  "Then we still have a
chance," says our optimistic heroine.
Meanwhile, their activities have caught the attention
of Mr. Tweedy.  "The chickens are organizing," he
urges the Missus, to which she replies, "chickens
can't organize."  But, she does notice that egg
production is dropping.  Tired of minuscule profits,
she decides to enter a different business that is even
more threatening to the livelihoods of the chicken
population.  Now, it's a race for survival.  If Ginger
and her flock can not escape in time, they may all
wind up in the frozen food section of the local
supermarket.
"Chicken Run," with its humorous level of mayhem, is a
fun movie for children.  However, it would have been
more appealing if the colors/palettes used weren't so
bleak.  Yet this is a film about a chicken
pen-itentiary, so its hues are understandably grayish.
 Adults will also find the plot engaging and even
dramatic.  And if you're familiar with the creator's
popular "Wallace and Gromit" mini-films, you'll find
many of its charming quirks here, including the heavy
Yorkshire accents, and the lipless faces with mouths
that have more bottom teeth than top ones.
Of greatest note is the amount of work needed to
create this film.  It uses Stop-motion photography in
which the models are minutely reshaped and
repositioned from shot to shot to give the illusion of
3-D movement.  To create one second of film, 24 shots
are required.  Anything less would result in
Gumby-esque choppiness.  Some of the scenes are
wonderfully and incredibly complex, including the
morning roll call; a dance party; and the clever
finale.  "Chicken Run" is fun to watch and amazing to
look at.  It's not as rousing a tale or as colorful as
Toy Story 2, but it's certainly as inventive and as
sweet.

Running Time: 85 minutes
Sometimes there are animated wonders. The year 1999 had the amazing "Toy 
Story 2", 1998 had the classic "Mulan", and going all the way back to the 
original "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" animation has come a long way. 
However let's not get on the subject of Disney films, but rather Dreamworks 
Animated Movies, whose films include 1998's "The Prince of Egypt", and 2000's 
flop "The Road to El Dorado" has now come out with a new instant classic 
"Chicken Run", a brilliant, funny well animated movie that is worthy of all 
the praise it can get.
Taking place in the 1950's, "Chicken Run" is about a big group of chickens, 
whose farm they live on belonging to the Tweedy's is a bit like a Poultry 
Holocaust setting, they try and try their hardest to get out of this pin, 
because if they do not lay eggs anymore, they die and become friend chicken. 
The main character Ginger (Julia Swalha) is the young chicken who is the one 
that is destined to get out and try if her tries fail. She tries many times, 
but is locked away in a dumpster for a few days to return back to the pin and 
do it all over again. One day a gift from heaven comes, the suave Rocky the 
Rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) who literally flies over their pin, saves the 
day by trying to teach the girls how to fly out of this coop. 
However Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy have something else on their minds, and the 
chickens must get out of the pin and escape or die frying. Along the way they 
have some hilarious misadventures, with sweet and clever dialogue and very 
well developed characters for chickens that is. The voices also are a 
standout with Julia Sawalha being the best out of all of them. She brings out 
her voice and makes it full force as well as hilarious. The supporting 
chickens are funny as well, that at times had me rolling so hard. Mel Gibson 
is a great voice too and fits Rocky the Rooster quite well. Miranda 
Richardson does the spooky character voice for Mrs. Tweedy and sounds very 
nice, as well as mean. Tony Haygarth plays the cowardly Mr. Tweedy who really 
isn't as mean as Mrs. Tweedy is.
The animation on the film is beyond amazing, the claymation used in this film 
is colorful, brilliant and fantastically done. You can really tell in some 
scenes that alot of work (3 years) was put into this film. In the end, 
however it shows wonderfully. The movement of these chickens is smooth and 
makes those old Gumby episodes look like mush. Even with Disneys $200m flop 
'Dinosaur' I would have to pick 'Chicken Run' as having the best animation so 
far this year, not because of the fact that its animated, but because of the 
fact of all the work that was put into this film in the past three years and 
$42 million dollars later. 
The film a wonderful children's movie that kids will sit and enjoy, laugh at 
and be entertained by. Its direction, voices and story are so brought out 
well, that this may be one of the best animated films I've seen. It is 
certainly one of the best films of 2000. There really isn't any flaws in the 
film, which is a rare occasion in Hollywood these days. Last year we had 
"American Beauty" another Dreamworks film, and in 1998 we had "Saving Private 
Ryan" yet another Dreamworks film. If this is the case, I hope Dreamworks 
puts out more films like "Chicken Run". Because as long as they do I will 
certainly be there to watch them.

   Everyone except poultry farmers and airline companies
should rejoice at the creation of this wonderful Claymation
movie, one featuring chickens who act more human than we
do and a pair of farmers who behave more like vultures and
jackals than sensitive homo sapiens.  Chicken farmers of the
world have nothing to celebrate, which becomes obvious in
the very first suspense-filled moments of the action since,
after all, we're obliged to sympathize with victims of
oppression and not their jailers.  As for airline companies,
credit Karey Kirkpatrick's hatchet-sharp writing that makes
"Chicken Run" perhaps even more appealing to adults than to
the more-visual-than-literary young 'uns who have towed
them into the theaters.  In one of the film's sharpest lines, a
high-fashion mouse positions himself at the front of a
makeshift aircraft and instructs the fowl who are about to take
off to freedom, "In the event of an emergency, put your head
between your legs...and kiss your butt goodbye."  This may
not be an original gag--it was in fact created by a realistic
cynic during the atomic age to spoof the belief that we could
protect ourselves by hiding under our desks.  But never
before was the quip so neatly placed within the context of a
story.
   In one dramatic scene, Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth), the,
uh, henpecked husband of farm proprietor Mrs. Tweedy
(Miranda Richardson), cries out, "The chickens are revolting!"
to which the Mrs. retorts, "For once we agree."  This is but
one example of the wordplay that makes the story a delight
for adults, a story filled with puns, with metaphoric
expressions made literal ("Hey, this is chicken-feed," says a
mouse upon receiving insufficient payment for a job he is
about to perform), and with jazzy lines.  A World War II
chicken-mascot-veteran, like others of his flock, becomes
human in the way he lives for the memories of his medal-
filled battle experiences and lectures the younger members of
the farm on how easy they have things today despite their
position in a prison camp.
   Though the most obvious take-off is of "Stalag 17," with
one of the huts featuring the number 17 and with the jailbirds
surprisingly content in their captivity, the 1950's British setting
of the project may remind you of George Orwell's "Animal
Farm." (That's the book all high-school kids choose to read
for their required reports because it's regularly the thinnest
text on the list.)  While "Chicken Run" does not really have an
Orwellian political agenda--its directors, Peter Lord and Nick
Park insisting that they are not vegetarians--the film's chicks
are so human that scholars with time on their hands are
bound to make postmodern and Marxist, even feminist
interpretations of the agenda.
    The farm in question exists for the production of eggs. 
When the quota is not met, Mrs. Tweedy enjoys the lazy bird
for dinner.  (A critique of capitalism?)  Early on, one hapless
hen is indeed sent to the execution chamber, its carcass
showing up on the Tweedy table hours later.  This act
motivates the animals to escape a situation that looks
insurmountable.  The fences are high and vicious dogs patrol
regularly.  When Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson)
glides into the compound explaining that he is himself an
escapee from the circus, he is enjoined by the honcho hen,
Ginger (Julia Sawalha), to teach the company how to fly. 
The motivation becomes stronger when Mrs. Tweedy
purchases a chicken-pie making machine, intending to
execute her entire barnyard at once to make quick profits.
(Another critique of capitalism?)  
   "Chicken Farm" stops for air quite a few times during its
brief 85 minutes, allowing the audience to soak in the hip
patter, taking a chance that the kids may fidget during these
absolutely non-MTV moments.  But Lord and Park, aiming to
keep the adults as enthralled as the children, does right in
allowing Karey Kirkpatrick's words to punch in, while in the
best action scene, the directors put the chicks through their
paces inside the huge, Chaplin-esque pot-pie machine.  As
two potential victims duck the sharp blades and parry with the
grinding wheels as though in a Claymation version of
"Modern Times," the audience gets a good look at the second
industrial revolution writ small--what the world was like before
high-tech dissolved much of the need for manual labor and
heavy machinery in the highly developed parts of the world.
   The assorted accents are an added plus, particularly the
combination of Cockney, Scottish, and American English all
competing for attention as the rulers of the roost and their
frightened followers make their dramatic bid for deliverance.
Prison is no fun, but hey, don't look at me: I get eggs only
from free-range chickens.

"Dinosaur" was depressingly recycled and ineffectual, and "Titan A.E." was 
uneven and forgettable, but "Chicken Run," directed by "Wallace and Gromit" 
alums Nick Park and Peter Lord, is a fresh and entertaining animated film, 
filled with originality, wit, and sharp writing that makes it the ideal 
motion picture of the summer that the whole family can go to and 
unadulteratedly enjoy.
Most are comparing the film to a spin on the POW pictures of the past, like 
"The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17," but striking me as more of a 
chicken-based variation on the Holocaust, "Chicken Run" is set at Mr. and 
Mrs. Tweedy's England-based farm, and centers on the poultry inhabitants who 
are constantly making attempts to escape the fenced-in, barbed-wired 
confinement that they have been restricted to. The head of most of the 
chickens' plans is the resourceful Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha, of TV's 
"Absolutely Fabulous"), who dreams of living the rest of her life free to 
roam the world's open spaces without having to worry about laying a certain 
number of eggs in order to survive the clutches of her owners. 
One day, the suave American, Rocky (Mel Gibson), literally drops in on them, 
and billed as "The Amazing Flying Chicken" on a circus poster that was 
attached to him, they view him as their savior. Rocky halfheartedly agrees to 
teach everyone how to fly, but Ginger eventually begins to suspect he is just 
biding his time and doesn't, in fact, know how to fly himself. Their problems 
thicken when the chickens begin to receive overly generous food portions, and 
they soon learn that the evil Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) is planning to 
fatten everyone up and turn them into chicken pies. "I don't want to be a 
pie," the alarmed and fairly naive Babs (Jane Horrocks) replies to the 
distressing news. "I don't even like gravy." Babs' words ring throughout the 
group of chickens, and they all realize it is up to them to escape once and 
for all, or die trying. 
In the vein of the recent "Toy Story 2," "Chicken Run" is a marvelous 
children's movie that is smart enough to not talk down to the young ones, or 
the adults, and is stuffed with more than enough sophisticated jokes that the 
kids will think are silly, and the parents will think are truly droll and 
funny. Using the talents of Aardman Animation Studios, the film is an 
extraordinary example of clay animation at its best. Colorful and smoothly 
constructed, the picture rivals 1993's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" as 
the strongest use of basic claymation seen in a feature film.
Like so many animated films with animals, the chickens are humanized to the 
point where they act and speak like people, but screenwriter Karey 
Kirkpatrick goes one step further and allows you to respect and care about 
the likable characters and their plight. Unlike "Titan A.E.," which contained 
some of the most bland voice-over work in recent memory, everyone in the cast 
of "Chicken Run" fits their characters to a tee, and clearly believe in the 
project. Julia Sawalha is charming as the savvy Ginger, and Mel Gibson equips 
himself with all of the cool swagger and self-optimism that characterizes the 
memorable Rocky, Ginger's potential love interest. Finally, Miranda 
Richardson is convincing as the dastardly Mrs. Tweedy, who looks and sounds 
reminiscent of Margaret Hamilton, as the Wicked Witch of the West, in 1939's 
"The Wizard of Oz."
With this year's animated releases, it seems that the tendency to turn every 
film of its type into a Disney-style musical has finally run its course, and 
rightfully so. While there is no doubt that 1989's "The Little Mermaid" and 
1991's "The Beauty and the Beast" are great films, "Chicken Run," just like 
the "Toy Story" movies, excels in its involvement of the story because it 
does not require its characters to break out into song, and, rather, contains 
only background music to simply set the tone.
At a fast 85 minutes (about the norm for a big-screen animated picture), 
"Chicken Run" whizzes right by, and if there is a complaint to be had, it is 
that the film is over just a little too quickly. By tacking on a few extra 
minutes, the supporting chickens could have been developed more strongly. 
This is a small qualm, however, as "Chicken Run" is a family film full of 
wonder and excitement. It may also even have the power to make you think 
twice the next time you run through the drive-thru at your local KFC.

I know that "funnest" isn't a word. "Fun" is a noun, and therefore 
cannot be conjugated like an adjective. But that's the word that came to 
me right after viewing "Chicken Run." No wonder: This is the kind of 
movie that reduces you to childish expressions, like "That was the 
funnest movie I've ever seen!" So to hell with Webster's -- "Chicken 
Run" is one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while. I can't remember 
the last time I've seen anything funner.
The chickens at Tweedy's Farm are up to something. Living in a 
concentration camp-like atmosphere, they are led by one plucky hen 
called Ginger (voice of Julia Sawalha) who continually comes up with 
plans for escape -- and always gets caught, subsequently spending day 
after day in the coal box. One night, a brash American rooster flies in 
over the fence, calling himself Rocky (Mel Gibson), famous flying 
rooster and circus performer. Rocky promises to teach the chickens how 
to fly, and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious Mrs. 
Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling 
plan for a pie-selling plan. She orders a huge pie-making machine, 
cackling, "Chickens go in; pies come out." What sort of pies? Chicken 
pies, of course.
Co-director Nick Park and his studio, Aardman Animation, produced three 
Oscar-winning short films: "Creature Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers," 
and "A Close Shave." The latter two were the second and third 
installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team Wallace & Gromit, 
a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly 
peculiar adventures. Part of what made the "Wallace" films brilliantly 
entertaining was Park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new. 
"The Wrong Trousers," for example, pulled out a lot of old Hitchcockian 
suspense tricks, and "A Close Shave" owed a great deal of inspiration to 
classic detective stories. But in the hands of Park and his team, the 
stories felt fresh and inspired, and not the least bit contrived.
Now teaming with co-director Peter Lord, Park has created a similar 
creature in "Chicken Run." The plot is largely lifted from "The Great 
Escape" (watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene), with 
some Spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement. Thing 
is, the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else; 
"Chicken Run" feels fresh, alive, like nothing else ever done. Part of 
it is the original idea: Who in the world came up with the idea to make 
a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens? Park and Lord milk the 
incongruity for all it's worth: The characters treat their situation as 
if it were dead serious, and to them, it is. But they're *chickens*, so 
it's funny to us.
Another thing that helps "Chicken Run" (and most of Park's films) 
succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films 
they're cribbing. There are references to "The Great Escape," obviously, 
and "Stalag 17." The chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies 
both "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom." There's even a nod to "The Blues Brothers," if you can believe 
it, and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the 
expense of their star voice actor, taking a couple of very subtle jabs 
at Mel Gibson's nationality and film history. The "Braveheart" reference 
is a hoot if you catch it.
When you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody 
and a redundant one, "Chicken Run" is downright brilliant in its 
execution. Consider this: Since July of last year, I've seen dozens upon 
dozens of "Blair Witch Project" parodies, on television, on the radio, 
and online. Out of all those, maybe one or two were amusing, the rest 
tiresome. Why? Because once you got past the thought that "they're 
parodying that 'Blair Witch' movie," most of the parodies had nothing to 
offer -- no insight, no original idea, no greater purpose. They were 
only funny if you had seen the movie; otherwise, you got nothing. 
Conversely, "Chicken Run" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film 
references are never the sole focus of any scene. If you've never seen 
"Indiana Jones," the chase sequence is still fun. Even if you have no 
idea who Mel Gibson is, Rocky remains an interesting character. Park, 
Lord, and screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick realize that an audience does 
not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood, and as a 
result, "Chicken Run" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are 
never too obvious, but not quite vague either. Enjoyment of this movie 
doesn't require knowledge of film history, but if you've got it, 
"Chicken Run" is that much richer.
The voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances, and the 
characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not 
to fall in love with every one of them. Ginger is perfect, spunky and 
opinionated, but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her 
companions behind, and Julia Sawalha (known as the cute mousy girl on 
"Absolutely Fabulous") nails it. She has warm, human chemistry with 
Gibson, whose Rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho 
veneer. The characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived, but 
sweet. Poor Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth) suspects the chickens are 
organizing in some way, but his limited intellect prevents him from 
figuring things out, and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help. 
Jane Horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically 
optimistic Babs (a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners, 
all while perpetually crocheting a sweater), and two supply-trading rats 
that seem to have walked straight out of a Monty Python sketch nearly 
steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence. They 
even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars 
and theologians alike for decades: the chicken vs. egg dilemma. One 
might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome, but 
as with most of "Chicken Run," it comes as a delightful surprise.
The film manages to cross all barriers; it should be accessible to both 
children and adults, Brits and Yanks, rats and chickens. The animation 
is first-rate. Remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way, 
with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by 
painstaking bit, and you see just how truly remarkable "Chicken Run" 
really is. This movie possesses that same quality that makes Pixar 
Studios' animation great: precise and unwavering attention to detail. As 
in such top-notch family fare as "A Bug's Life" or "Toy Story 2," 
"Chicken Run" has something to offer in nearly every frame. Certainly a 
passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile 
moral and some surprisingly touching scenes, but a active, attentive 
viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details.
Anyway, the movie's just a boatload of fun. Funnest damn movie I've seen 
all year.

Ginger has been taken to the shed. There lies Mrs. Tweedy's new machine -- 
where chickens go in, and pies come out. Rocky runs in to save her, and 
together they must dodge chutes, chopping blocks, mincers, gravy squirters, 
pastry cutters and an oven.
This is an amazing moment in "Chicken Run", the first animated feature to be 
co-directed by Nick Park of "Wallace and Gromit" fame. The plot involves the 
escape attempts of chickens on Tweedy farm, where the lady of the house has 
decided to ditch egg production and focus on selling meat. If everything had 
been in the same vein as the scene above -- vital to the characters, true to 
their nature, staged excitingly -- then the movie might live up to its ad 
campaign, which hypes it as the latest kiddie flick to revolutionise the 
genre. It doesn't, and isn't even a very good film.
The chickens hold meetings in Hutch 17, there is a Cooler King and a 
hyperactive Scot, and a character played by Mel Gibson at one point shouts 
"Freedom!". But references to "Stalag 17", "The Great Escape", "Braveheart" 
and countless other pieces of pop culture feel forced, because they're 
stuffed into scenes without any thought, like a desperate attempt to make the 
humour hip. "The Simpsons" satirises pop culture with subtlety; "Chicken Run" 
feels like "Scream 3" for primary-schoolers.
That might be less irritating if the movie worked on some basic level. "Toy 
Story" allowed us into the world of toys, "Babe" into that of animals -- so 
long as we suspended disbelief enough to accept toys coming to life or 
different species of beasts communicating with each other. The creatures in 
this picture can read words, write maps, sew, conduct detailed medical 
examinations and perform amazing feats of engineering... so what's the point? 
Is there any interest or suspense in watching poultry act human, when there 
is no logic or limitation to their reality? The climax sees them escape by 
building a plane. Go figure.
Small tots will enjoy "Chicken Run" for its visual delights. The Claymation 
process here has advanced significantly from the "Wallace and Gromit" days -- 
it now involves a different form of shooting, and models built around 
detailed synthetic skeletons. For older children and adults, it's thin soup. 
Watching chickens behave like people, even if they have been brought to life 
with fluid dimensionality, is like watching kids dress in their parents' 
clothes -- cute and amusing for about five minutes, and then you just wish 
they'd find another game to play.
