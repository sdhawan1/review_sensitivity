Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat is a living legend, and it's about time
that mainstream America found out.  The ever-charismatic Chow will
certainly have no trouble winning new fans with his English language debut,
Antoine Fuqua's brisk, explosive The Replacement Killers.
In comparison to the dark, complex collaborations with John Woo (who
executive produced) that made Chow an international superstar, Replacement
is not exactly the sturdiest of vehicles.  The entire storyline of Ken
Sanzel's thin script can be summed up by its title.  Chow plays John Lee, a
hitman who wants out of a contract with his mob boss employer (Kenneth
Tsang), who hence dispatches "replacements" to kill him and his ally, a
document forger named Meg Coburn (a game Mira Sorvino, running around in an
open shirt).
The plot is just the glue that holds together what is essentially one long
series of wildly choreographed gunfights, which is far from a bad thing.
Fuqua, whose slick style is best described as a cross between Michael Bay
and (of course) Woo, wisely lets Chow be Chow--in other words, do all the
things that makes him the coolest actor around.  Throughout the film, I
found myself breathing sighs of relief as the outrageous derring-do from
the Chow I know and love appeared onscreen--sliding on floors, flying
through the air, rolling around and flipping, firing from each hand.  Early
on, though, Fuqua makes a serious miscalculation by having Chow hold a gun
with both hands (believe it or not, Columbia Pictures reportedly brought in
someone to teach trigger-happy Chow how to shoot a gun), and his discomfort
is obvious.  But there is only one scene where he does so, and soon after
Chow is allowed to ease into his normal routine.
As well as Chow is serviced by The Replacement Killers, it still only
scratches the surface of his talent.  His dour role erases all traces of
his appealing sense of humor; Fuqua, perhaps caught up in his reverence for
the man, takes Chow's character a bit _too_ seriously, sometimes eliciting
an odd chuckle from the audience.   And the depth of his dramatic range is
only hinted at in the silent, subtly acted scene where Lee cannot go
through with what is to be his last hit. But I suppose all depth will
have to be reserved for when Chow reunites with Woo (which he is slated to
do in the forthcoming action comedy King's Ransom).  Until then,
Replacement will do.  It delivers all the mayhem and thrills one would
want--and expect--from a popcorn action film and serves as a perfectly
adequate American introduction to the living legend that is Chow Yun-Fat.

Though born and raised stateside, I was fortunate enough to watch Hong
Kong action movies growing up.  And though my definition of the ultimate
hero is more Jack Ryan than Jackie Chan, I can still appreciate the
slickness of Chow Yun Fat.  Naturally, I was excited when I heard of his
debut in the American mainstream market in The Replacement Killers. 
The plot is rather wafer thin.  Fat is an assassin who refuses to kill
his mark, a detective's son, and in doing so condemns himself to the ire
of his underworld employer.  To aid in his escape, fat solicits the aid
of forger Mira Sorvino.  
The atmosphere, however, is very Michael Mann-esque slick.  In addition
to Chow Yun Fat's smooth demeanor and solemn expressions, The
Replacement Killers is a cinematic exercise in mood setting.  Peter
Collister has filled every frame with midnight blues and metallic grays
enhanced by a neon-lit background.  The firefight sequences are
choreographed to a dance, with every draw and trigger pull an extension
of the characters themselves.  What Fat does not speak, he more than
expresses with the use of twin 9mm Berettas.  
Yet although the plot is thin, the not all the characters are not
completely uni-dimensional, close but not quite.  Fat's, John Lee, is
one of few words.  His dour face suggests a tortured soul beyond the
cool veneer.  His movement and form is so graceful, he becomes almost
mythological.  Fat certainly has presence, and while that is sufficient
to carry him through this film, his future projects could make better
use of his incredible acting range as yet not witnessed by Hollywood.  
Sorvino, though incredibly arresting and alluring, is wasted here.  Her
Meg Coburn attempts to be both Lee's grounding in sanity and firepower
assistance amidst the chaos.  Though Sorvino gives more than a valiant
attempt to breathe life into Meg, the plot does not give her room to
maneuver.  
The supporting actors, Jurgen Prochnow, Michael Rooker and Danny Trejo,
are all underutilized.  Prochnow impressed everyone as the stolid and
lonely captain in Das Boat.  Rooker was much more animate in
Cliffhanger, Sea of Love, and Days of Thunder, as was Danny Trejo in
Heat.  Being relegated to supporting roles notwithstanding, their
characters should have been more significant.  
The Replacement Killers, like Ridley Scott's Black Rain, is definitely
competent entertainment and not as mind-numbing as it easily could have
been.   Antoine Fuqua attempts to make no social commentary and only a
token address to morality, and thus the audience will find no dose of
profundity.  What the audience does find is Fat and Sorvino, radiating
ambiance behind a glossy backdrop of Los Angeles.

Synopsis: 
The title of this gangster redemption movie THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
might be a reference to THE KILLER, a famous Asian movie about gangster
redemption, starring Chow Yun-Fat. The story is simple:
Hitman John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat), does the honorable thing and refuses his
assignment to terminate a seven-year-old boy. This angers his powerful
mobster boss, and the incensed crime lord hires a swarm of goons
('replacement killers') to kill off John and the kid. At first John's
main concern is to reach China to put his mother and sister out of reach
of the crime lord's vengeance. So he meets up with a forger named Meg
(Mira Sorvino)in order to get a passport. But apparently it's open
season on John and Meg. They're in over their heads and chased around
town by loads of gunslinging goon squads. The rest of the movie is all
high octane 'run and gun.' When the bullets stop flying after the final
confrontation, the movie basically ends.
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is co-produced by John Woo, [Director of
FACE/OFF]. The cinematography is super and so are the shootouts. 
Opinion:
With THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, we're talking about a much beloved plot
formula. Picture a 1950s black and white Japanese samurai movie. Outlaw
samurai blows into town and tries to act honorably. But an even nastier
dishonorable samurai with more men is out to kill innocent townsfolk.
The outlaw hero ends up using his formidable swordsmanship skills to
dispatch blade-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he walks
off into the sunset.
Fast forward to the 1970s. Take the same movie, and make everyone wear a
cowboy hat, boots, and a pancho. Outlaw gunfighter (picture Cline
Eastwood) blows into town and tries to act honorably. But a nastier
outlaw gunfighter with more men is out to kill innocent townsfolk. The
outlaw gunfighter ends up using his formidable shooting skills to cap
gun-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he rides a horse
off into the sunset.
Now it's 1998. Add cool music, artsy cinematography, more shootouts, and
a hot-looking blonde sidekick. The outlaw gunfighter who blows into town
is an oriental gangster who tries to act honorably. But a mafia-type
mobster with loads of men is out to kill an innocent boy. The oriental
assassin ends up using his formidable shooting skills to dispatch
gun-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he rides a plane
off into the sunset.
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is quite thin on suspense and plot, but the
cinematography is excellent and so are the gun battles. Mira Sorvino
does a credible job as Meg, and Chow Yun-Fat may not become as famous as
Clint Eastwood after this flick, but after THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS his
name is sure to become a second tier household word in America. 
Stars:
1.  Chow Yun-Fat
Put simply, Chow Yun-Fat is Asia's top actor - - he's kind of like an
Asian Robert Mitchum; Chow Yun-Fat's a a guy that Asian ladies think is
hunky because he's humble and has a manly charisma at the same time. Fat
was born a poor farm boy on an island near Hong Kong. He began laboring
at age 5 doing farm chores, and selling dim sum in the Hong Kong alleys
and streets with his mother. He never completed a formal education, but
a lucky break occured during school. A TV network sent two applications
for auditions, and when Fat tried out, they gave him a chance as an
actor. The rest, as they say, is history.
Fat - - who hates to be called Mr. Chow and prefers to be called 'Fat'
or his nickname 'Fatboy' - -  doesn't know the first thing about kung
fu, but the man can act. He once played an idiot savant like Dustin
Hoffman's RAIN MAN character. And like Susan Lucci, Chow Yun-Fat was a
prime time soap star with years of TV dramas (over 14 years to be exact)
under his belt. Like Richard Gere, Chow Yun-Fat did cheesy gigolo flicks
in the 1970s. And like James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart, Chow excels
portraying the cool, toothpick-chewing, chain-smoking - - but somehow
noble - - gun-toting gangster. A versatile actor, Fat has also played a
bumbling country oaf. 
Though he has worked primarily in Hong Kong, now Chow Yun-Fat is in
Hollywood and has the attention of big name directors like Oliver Stone,
Quentin Tarantino, and John Woo. It took a year and half of English
lessons for him to learn enough English to star in THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS. The burning question for money-minded moguls of Hollywood is:
Chow Yun-Fat is a great success in Asia, but will an Eastern hero
concept - - an understated blend of humility and charisma in a nonwhite
man - - be marketable to an American audience accustomed to Brad Pitt,
Ethan Hawke, Leonardo DiCaprio, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, and Mel
Gibson?
2. Mira Sorvino 
Mira is a Harvard cum laude graduate. She once spent eight months living
in Beijing, and was a Chinese studies major in college.  She won an
Oscar in 1995 for playing a porn actress in the film MIGHTY APHRODITE.

Los Angeles, Chinatown: Der chinesische Immigrant John Lee (Chow
Yun-Fat) wird von dem Unterwelt-Paten Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang) erpresst.
In Shangai leben noch Lees Mutter und seine Schwester, der Vater diente
mit Wei im Krieg. Heute nun steht Lee unter erheblichen Druck. Wenn er
das Leben und die Gesundheit seiner Familie nicht riskieren will, muί er
fόr Wei riskante Auftrδge όbernehmen - ob er will oder nicht.
Der Triaden-Boί setzt ihn vornehmlich als Profikiller ein. Und Lee macht
seine Arbeit gut, wenn auch widerstrebend. Als er nach einem weiteren
Intermezzo als kaltblόtiger Revolverheld in das Hauptquartier des
Gangsters zurόckkehrt, wartet bereits der nδchste Job auf ihn. Er soll
den Sohn des L.A.-Detectives Stan Zedkov (Michael Rooker) tφten. Zedkov
Senior ist fόr den Tod von Weis Sohn verantwortlich, der bei einer
Drogenrazzia erschossen wurde. Nun sucht Wei Rache fόr sein Fleisch und
Blut...
Mit sichtlichem Unbehagen nimmt John Lee seine Scharfschόtzenstellung in
der Nδhe von Detective Zedkovs Haus ein. Als der Cop am Abend zu seiner
Familie zurόckkehrt und Lee den siebenjδhrigen Jungen ins Visier nimmt,
spielt ihm sein Gewissen einen Streich. Er bringt es nicht όbers Herz
abzudrόcken.
Lee weiί, daί sein Versagen einer Kriegserklδrung an Mr. Wei
gleichzusetzen ist. Er beauftragt einen buddhistischen Mφnch, seine
Familie in Sicherheit zu bringen und begibt sich selbst auf die Flucht
vor den Hδschern des Unterwelt-Bosses. Sein Ziel ist die Rόckkehr nach
China, um seine Familie schόtzen zu kφnnen. John Lee nimmt Kontakt mit
Eddie auf, einem kleinen Ganoven, der die Waffen fόr die Attentate
organisiert. Eddie empfiehlt Lee die Paίfδlscherin Meg Coburn (Mira
Sorvino), um an falsche Papiere fόr eine Einreise in die Volksrepublik
zu gelangen.
Doch der Besuch bei der ebenso selbstbewuίten wie eigenstδndigen Coburn
endet in einem wahren Kugelhagel. Als Weis Killer auftauchen, gelingt
Lee zwar mit der schlagkrδftigen Unterstόtzung von Coburn die Flucht,
sie selbst aber landet in den Armen der Polizei und im Verhφr von
Detective Zedkov. Der setzt sie jedoch rasch wieder auf freien Fuί, um
sie als Lockvogel fόr Mr. Wei zu benutzen.
Der Plan gelingt. Meg Coburn packt eilig ein paar Habseligkeiten, um
sich aus der Schuίlinie zu bringen als John Lee wieder in ihrer Tόr
steht. Die gezogene Automatik lδίt keinen Zweifel daran aufkommen, daί
er ihre Dienste dringend benφtigt. Das Paar wider Willen macht sich auf
den Weg zu Eddies Waschstraίe als Weis rechte Hand, Michael Kogan, mit
seinen Bodyguards auftaucht, um ihnen einen heiίen Empfang zu bereiten.
Eine weitere »Orgie in Blei« findet ihr Ende als Zedkov und seine Mδnner
auftauchen, die sich an Meg Coburns Fersen geheftet hatten. Doch damit
fδngt die Jagd erst richtig an...

        Replacement Killers marks the American debut of Chow-Yun Fat. For 
those not familiar with his work, he has been in the business (TV and 
Film) for a long time. Most famous in America for his work with John Woo: 
The Killer, A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, and Hard Boiled, Chow's repertoire 
is not in any way restricted to action films. He has been in many 
comedies and dramas as well: Hong Kong 1941, God of Gamblers, and All 
About Ah-Long (for which he won a Best Actor award) are some of his best 
work in those areas.  
        Chow, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors who ever lived 
and the fact that Chinese is not my native tongue probably adds more to 
that title.  He was made for the camera.
        Now, it's true that Chow is amazing in gun-toting action roles, 
mainly because of his incomparable coolness and charisma.  It's a fact 
that no one looks better than Chow with a gun in each hand, therefore it 
was inevitable that Chow's first dive into American cinema would be an 
action film.
        Replacement Killers is not, in any way, a bad movie. The best way 
to describe it would be painfully mediocre.  
        The movie starts off well.  A man is being chased through the 
streets, and is captured and killed by a cop.  It turns out that he was 
the child of a very powerful man (Kenneth Tsang).  That powerful man 
wants revenge, the cop must be killed.  Enter John Li (Chow Yun-Fat).  
John is told that he must kill the cop's son and this will be his last 
job.  Well, John can't kill him because he has a heart of gold.  So, 
instead of killing the boy, he basically ruins the rest of his life 
putting himself and his family in danger.
        John needs a fake passport to China, and is sent to Meg Coburn 
(Mira Sorvino), bad guys come to kill her and John, and they fail.  The 
rest is pretty predictable.
        Chow's English is great.  He has two 'speeches' in the movie and 
they are both well-delivered. However, when he speaks in short sentences 
he sounds stiff.
        Well, action movies such as this are not often hailed for their 
intriguing character development.  What usually separates the good from 
the ugly in this genre is style.  Fuqua (whose only credit is directing 
Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise music video) handles the direction nicely.  
The action scenes, for the most part, look good, but never really become 
tense or exciting.  The main characters are 2-dimensional and the bad 
guys, even more-so.  There are quite a few memorable scenes, though. A 
short gun fight in a movie theater was nice.  Chow with a gun in both 
hands shooting down a car going in reverse was definitely cool.  There is 
also an interesting use of colors, neon greens, reds, etc.
        There are quite a few HK movie influences here, and when Fuqua 
gets creative, the result is excellent; but, there is not enough 
originality in this movie.  The atmosphere is cold and humorless, and any
emotion seems out of place.  Chow has an incredible smile, but this film 
never lets him use it.  
The print I saw had no music, and a good score could definitely help the 
movie out.

CAPSULE: Perversely entertaining Hong Kong action with the God of Gamblers
himself, Chow Yun-Fat. Mira Sorvino ain't bad either, but the main
attraction is the movie's glossy look.
Chow Yun-Fat commands the screen the way very few actors do, no matter where
they're from. See him in the dozens of other movies he's done for the Hong
Kong studios (and hang yourself if you haven't seen him in John Woo's
masterpieces THE KILLER and HARD-BOILED). He is one of the few cult-movie
figures who lives up to and beyond the hype. In THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, he
strides onscreen as if just coming in from another HK production without
losing a beat.
HK fan that I am, I held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite
some time. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS was designed to be Chow's big U.S. debut
vehicle, but it also serves as the debut for director Antoine Fuqua (whose
only previous directorial job was the "Gangster's Paradise" video for
Coolio). Both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie,
which helps to buoy it all up out of the routine and into the realm of the
special.
The plot is not the main attraction. Chow plays a hitman who crumbles when
faced with the prospect of having to ice a policeman, and decides to flee
the country. To that end, he enlists Mira Sorvino's character -- a tattooed
forgery artist who lives in an apartment that looks like a close cousin to
the one J.F. Sebastian inhabited in BLADE RUNNER. Then bad guys with tons of
firepower come gunning for both of them, and they have to hit the road.
Fuqua knows his HK action staples. The movie is saturated with highly
choreographed violence. The whole movie glows and glitters: shattering
glass, guns blazing, false-color shots from *inside* a gun as a round is
chambered. Sparks shoot as high-tension lines give when bodies fall on them.
Metal crumples as cars slam into each other, reflecting the moody
green-and-yellow lighting in an underground parking garage. Sunglasses
glint. Put simply, if you don't like movies where these things all figure in
abundance, stay home. If you do, buy three copies. You'll wear them all out
soon enough.
Chow and Sorvino's characters do not like each other very much -- it's hard
to like someone who seems to be responsible for getting your place
torched -- but they form a mutual respect which is credible on-screen, and
work together to get themselves out of trouble. There's also a good
supporting role by Michael Rooker (remember him from HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A
SERIAL KILLER?) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the
outside, and  yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of Jurgen
Prochnow.
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is all surface, but it's a wonderful surface to look
at. Good show all around. Now let's see Chow -- and Fuqua -- in something a
little more substantial. I *know* Chow can handle it.

The Replacement Killers could have been a good, solid action movie.
It could have been a sleeper hit; a movie that decided to break a few
rules and be original and inventive.  Instead it's a boring,
forgettable movie that'll be out of theaters in a few weeks.
It's the American debut of Chow Yen Fat, who's Hong Kong films The
Killer and Hard Boiled made him the best action star in the movies
today.  He has a grace about his characters: he can be somber and
confident at the same time.  When you compare him to American action
stars he seems more real, more identifiable.  After his international
success, he came to Hollywood and was wasted.  While he does manage to
walk out of The Replacement Killers with his reputation intact, but
everything else around him was a waste.  It also stars Mira Sorvino,
who plays your standard breaking the law loner who does everything her
way and fakes passports to make ends meet.  She's totally unbelievable
here and spends most of her time trying to convince us that she's
tough and knows how to shoot a gun.  To describe the plot is to waste
your time and lower your I.Q.  You don't pay attention to the details
in a movie like this, you don't follow the plot holes.  Things like
that will only frustrate you.  Instead, you wait for the action scenes
to come up (there's about five or six), you wait to see the skin shot
of Mira Sorvino (there's only one).  The action scenes were passable,
though they tended to get old after awhile.  Director Anotoine Fuqua
puts a little bit of style in the movie, he tries to give the movie an
Asian feel.  But his problem is that you don't really know if he's
spoofing Fat's movies, or if he's taking them seriously.  There's a
moment towards the end of the movie where Fat makes a stand-off with
the main mean bad guy.  The bad guy is driving down an alley in his
limo (because bad guys always ride in limos in movies like this), the
gates to his fortress open, and there stands Fat, holding seven or
eight handguns. Whether or not it was supposed to be funny, half the
theater laughed.  Fat didn't look confident, he looked ridiculous.
Rather than watch The Replacement Killers, rent Fat's best action
films, The Killer or Hard Boiled.  Those movies also brought director
John Woo to Hollywood.  Woo's first film was a bomb in Hard Target .
Hollywood let him stick around and he eventually made the successful
and acclaimed Face/Off.  Let's hope Fat gets the same chance.
The Replacement Killers (* and half out four).  Directed by Antoine
Fuqua.  Starring: Chow Yen Fat, Mira Sorvino.

It happened with Jackie Chan and John Woo. It happened with Director
Ringo Lam. It even happened with Hong Kong's answer to Steven Spielberg,
Tsui Hark. Hong Kong filmmakers making their first projects for
Hollywood are having a hard time finding projects worthy of their
talents. Columbia / Tri-Stars latest release of "THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS" is unfortunately no exception to this trend.
The plot opens with a stake-out, let by Detective Stan Zedkov (Michael
Rooker -'Harry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', 'Rosewood') to capture
Chinese drug lord, Wei Tong. Things go bad when the gangsters are tipped
off by the early arrival of a police helicopter. A shoot out ensues,
ending with Tong being killed by Detective Zedkov. 
This sets up the films multi-layered revenge plot. At the funeral for
his son, Triad Boss, Mr. Wei confronts Det. Zedkov. Zedkov defends his
actions by saying that "Tong had made his own choice". Mr. Wei counters,
saying  "Some choices are out of our hands." 
John Lee (Chow Yun-fat) is brought in to perform a hit in retaliation
against the Detective. John is a cold and calculated assassin. A man
"who is perfect in his work". John is not an assassin by choice. He is
in servitude to Mr. Wei for some undisclosed debt. John is told that
after this last job, his debt will be paid in full.
John takes the job, but with a sense of reservation. Positioning himself
on a hillside near the Detective's home, John assembles his weapon. He
sights his target.. but finally cannot bring himself to perform the hit,
his eyes reddening with anguish and guilt, (an absolutely marvelous
piece of physical acting, done without the use of optical effects).
This act of defiance sets John at odds with his boss. Mr. Wei orders
that John and his family in China, be killed. John is now a fugitive
from both the law and the lawless. He arranges to meet with a person who
can supply him with a fake passport so that he can leave the country and
return to China in an effort to protect his Mother and Sister. He meets
with Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), a young woman who has made a living on
the opposite side of the law. She is now a forger, expert in creating
false ID's. Unfortunately, John has been traced to her hideout. A
blazing gun-fight erupts, with Meg and John forming an uncomfortable
alliance.
"The Replacement Killers" is one of the more visually stunning films to
come out of a major Hollywood Studio since the '60's. The look of the
film is sumptuous. Almost every frame is a painting, with diffused and
bold colors used to infuse scenes with emotion and mood. Unfortunately,
the film itself is void of those same qualities. Not to take anything
away from the film, the film is generally entertaining. The problem is,
is that there is an emotional distance in the film. There is no feeling
of dread, no feeling of threat, no sense of danger. It's almost as if we
were watching a music video. Director Antoine Fuqua is a marvelous
stylist, his handling of the visual look of the film and his staging of
action scenes is very promising. The film has a tempo and a rhythm that
is remarkable in and of itself. But that also serves to point out the
films biggest failing, his handling of his actors is almost
non-existent. 
Mr. Chow is a marvel to watch .You haven't seen this kind of screen
presents since Steve McQueen. Every time Chow Yun-fat is on screen, your
eyes immediately lock on him. His style and screen presents is the most
riveting thing in the film. No one handles a gun with more flair. Chow
Yun-fat has the grace of Gene Kelly. For the first time in an American
film, you believe that using two guns at once is physically possible.
While having been a major star in Asia for the past 15 years, the U.S.
has not really had the chance to experience this fine actor. It is a
testament to his talent and ability that the film is as captivating as
it is. 
Ms. Sorvino is poorly represented in the film. The character of Meg
Coburn is bereave of any development. She has no arc to her. That is
purely the fault of the script, which places more meaning on the action
than on the characters. But it is still a shame that as talented an
actress as Sorvino can be wasted like this. The scenes between Chow and
Sorvino have a forced, almost staged quality, there is no chemistry
between them. Chow Yun-fat's rescue of Sorvino during a car wash
shoot-out is remarkably forced, as he has no reason to save her life
other than to get his forged passport. There must obviously, be others
in Los Angeles that can perform that duty, so the reasoning behind the
rescue is sorely lacking.
Michael Rooker as Det. Zedkov is given the most ridiculous and out of
place facial hair that any law enforcement officer has ever had. Det.
Zedkov would look more at home being one of the hired assassins that
being an officer of the law. His character is also giving short shift by
the script. We know nothing about his character other than he is a
Detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, and that he has a son
that he adores. While we do see his wife (through the scope of Chow
Yun-fat's rifle) we are not introduced to her, therefore we are given
nothing to identify with. Det. Zedkov becomes a character servicing the
plot, nothing more.
Kenneth Tsang ('The Killer', 'Supercop') as Mr. Wei carries his role as
well as can be expected. All the script gives us is a man of immoral
power and corruption. Again, we know nothing about this man; why he is
respected or feared, what his exact illegal business is, and why as a
Triad leader, he has hired so many Europeans to work for him. J|rgen
Prochnow is completely wasted in the role of Wei's Enforcer. His
character is so lacking in development that he doesn't even have a name
(no one in the film calls him by name, unless his name is YOU!).
Going back to the look of the film. Cinematically, the film has a grand
an expressive feel. The use of color to dictate the emotion of the film
is nicely developed. The Cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister is
remarkable, and the sole essence of the film to show depth and
character. With a more developed script and more character development,
this technique would have giving us possibly the first post forties
'film noir'. 
The basic plot of the film has the makings of a fascinating crime drama.
The family loyalty / revenge motif that runs through the film is
interesting and should have been fully developed. The idea of taking
revenge against another by taking the lives of their loved ones is a
powerful plot construct. The most glaring disappointment is that John
Lee's family is only identified by a faded photograph. There are no
conversations with the family via phone or letter, no feeling that John
is alone in a foreign land. While it's possible to accept that John Lee
is a man who accepts his fate, the film does little to inform us of
that. 
All said, 'The Replacement Killers' is only a serviceable action film.
It supplies the requisite gunfights, car chases and explosions one
expects from the genre. But the lack of tension and drama severely
hamper the film, leaving one with the feeling that they've only seen
half of a finished film.
Rated **1/2 out ***** stars. A disappointing debut from Chow Yun-fat,
but one that does leave you wanting to see more.

      Antoine Fuqua, noted music video director, supplies the action
in his latest action thriller cleverly called THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS. This flashy, action-packed flick comes with some notable
performers: top Asian star Chow Yun-Fat and Oscar-winning actress Mira
Sorvino. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is your typical kinetic-kicking,
bullet-bouncing, danger-dodging, Hong Kong-oriented thriller that has
the legs but never manages to run with what you would expect a
distinctive action piece such as this deserves.
      Yun-Fat, who obviously is testing his stardom status here in the
U.S. just like his fellow Asian action stars Jackie Chan and Michelle
Yeoh, plays a wayward assassin from China sent to the United States to
complete a "hit" but his heart isn't in the right mode to do so. As a
result, Yun-Fat is stuck in the country and his only way of escaping
is to utilize the services of Sorvino's document forger. Together,
they scamper through chaotic crazy situations while shooting up the
joint left and right. There are some devastatingly dangerous yet dandy
stunts plus both stars come off as more clever and keen than what is
actually believed given their involvement in these sensational situ-
ations. However, you never really get to see any enthusiasm or robust
reaction to action hero Yun-Fat's character. He seems remote and more
like a shoot 'em up robot.  He doesn't seem to possess the campy high-
flying enjoyment like his action counterpart Jackie Chan does in his
movies. And the duo of Yun-Fat and Sorvino doesn't really click on
screen...their dynamic duo routine somehow doesn't register in the
compatibility department.
       THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is indeed a crafty and catchy title for
a thriller. But this movie never lives up to its exciting name. Maybe
it is because this film's motivation is from an American music video
director in that of Fuqua who simply lacks the intense, atmospheric
slap-happy exuberance from that of Asian directors like John Woo or
Stanley Tong who can satisfy the needs of the Hong Kong-style action
genre. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS ands its main star Chow Yun-Fat both
have the potential as a breakout hit and star in the U.S.
respectively but this vehicle needs to be driven by someone with more
charisma and character. A fair action thriller is offered here but
what a difference this movie would make from merely being fair to that
of being a fist-full-of-frenzied fun. A mild recommendation at best.

When I was in 2nd grade, I always looked forward to Fridays.  That was
the day that started off with Show and Tell.  I and my fellow
classmates would bring in our new pet frog, or new yo-yo, or a
fast-looking Hot Wheels car or some other shiny, new toy to impress
the others.  We said little to describe what we had because the items
were the show and nobody really listened to what we had to say anyway.
But we knew by the response of the classroom that we had to bring
something even better the next time.  It is now Hong Kong's turn to
play, and they have brought to America's film classroom something
shiny and slick called "The Replacement Killers" which is decidedly
more 'show' than 'tell'. 
The central part of this 'show' is a cool and suave Asian-action star
by the name of Chow Yun-Fat.  Having filmed dozens of movies in Hong
Kong, America now gets its first peek at Asia's Clint Eastwood.  As
John Lee, he is a reluctant assassin who handles guns in the same way
Monet handles a paint brush.  He is a deadly marksman, but he is also
an indentured servant of ruthless crime lord, Terence Wei.  If he
fails to perform, Wei will not hesitate to kill Lee's family.  But in
his latest assignment, his conscience prevents him from squeezing the
trigger.  He knows that there will be consequences, and he must use
his killer instincts to not only survive but to find a way to flee to
China to rescue his family.
Needing a fake passport, he meets up with Meg (Mira Sorvino), a
professional forger, but before she even has time to develop his
photo, Wei's henchmen arrive to kill him.  After a furious gun battle,
Lee manages to escape, and as the film progresses, the brooding hitman
finally begins to internalize the ruthlessness and evilness of Wei.
He slowly begins to realize that he needs to do more than just save
his family.  He must also save Meg as well as the person that he was
ordered to assassinate.
For a film where the guns do most of the talking, it isn't just a
one-dimensional shoot-em up.  The tone of the film is quickly
established early on, and its level of combustibility never
diminishes.  Elements of Hong Kong movie making add a certain aura of
style to the look of the film.  Shot in dark alleyways and small
buildings throughout LA's Chinatown, we feel the stress of his
claustrophobic situation.  Many dramatic scenes are shown in poetic
slow motion.  Gunplay dominates the movie, but the shootouts are
well-choreographed and gives Chow Yun-Fat ample opportunity to show
off his skills as he spins, leaps and pirouettes while gunning down
his enemies.  He is cool under fire; never cracks a joke; and
dispatches his enemies in an icy-cold, professional, no-nonsense
manner.  This characterization is the essence of Chow, and this is his
show.
As a result, the movie has a difficult time developing the chemistry
between Lee and Meg.  Also adept at handling a gun, it seemed
painfully obvious that the writers didn't want her to compete with
Chow's presence.  Although she's a prominant character, Meg doesn't
really leave any kind of mark, and presumably, Sorvino's inclusion may
have been just a casting decision to put someone familiar to American
audiences to improve its marketability.  Also, Lee's character is a
quiet man, so there isn't too much by way of dialogue. 
There is no doubt that Chow is likable and that this is a competent
action film for those who like their stories peppered with an
industrial soundtrack, sunglass-wearing thugs; and scenes where the
heroes are running for their lives amid a hail of bullets.  At 90
minutes, the movie takes you where you want to go without any annoying
detours.  It probably could have done a lot more, but manages to be a
nice show piece.  I know that the Hong Kong movie makers will bring
something even better next time.

Columbia / 1:28 / 1998 / R (language, violence)
Cast: Chow Yun-Fat; Mira Sorvino; Michael Rooker; Jurgen Prochnow; Carlos 
Gomez; Frank Medrano; Kenneth Tsang; Danny Trejo 
Director: Antoine Fuqua 
Screenplay: Ken Sanzel 
Whether you love or hate "The Replacement Killers," you've got to respect 
it's running time -- at a slim hour-and-28-minutes, the film speeds by 
faster than the ammo discharged from star Chow Yun-Fat's endless supply of 
firearms. Unfortunately, "The Replacement Killers" also boasts more story 
and character holes than he puts in his opponents, a drawback that keeps the 
movie from being both truly enjoyable and involving. It's certainly nothing 
new to find a action movie riddled with flaws, but at least this one has a 
must-see attraction in its leading man -- Yun-Fat, a Hong Kong idol making 
his American debut here, radiates absolute cool. 
He plays John Lee, an assassin with (yes, folks, say it with me) a heart of 
gold. Lee is hired by underworld kingpin Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang) to perform 
a hit in L.A. -- Wei's criminal son was killed in self-defense by stateside 
cop Stan Zedkov (Michael Rooker), and Wei would like Lee to shoot Zedkov's 
own seven-year-old in retaliation. Even though Wei will dispatch people to 
murder Lee's family if the job isn't completed, Lee just can't bring himself 
to pull the trigger. He then hooks up with a document-forger named Meg (Mira 
Sorvino), his only hope to get back to his home in time, and together they 
become marked targets from a new pair of professionals dispatched by Wei. 
Director Antoine Fuqua, the man behind Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise" music 
video, does what he can with Ken Sanzel's paint-by-numbers script; in 
particular, he's got style to spare, and demonstrates it from the first 
scene on. The loud, humdinger action makes up a large part of the movie, 
turning everyday locations like car washes, parking garages and theaters 
into dangerous, violent places (and that last one's quite a doozy). "The 
Replacement Killers" doesn't waste much time between them, and thus is over 
with quickly. The film is a dazzler for the eyes and ears, and that's about 
it. 
Chow Yun-Fat, who learned English for the movie, has an undeniable screen 
presence. He's also a strong actor, and so it's puzzling -- and even 
disappointing -- that John Lee has few scenes where he can project emotional 
depth (could it be that Yun-Fat was still a little too stiff with his 
newly-acquired dialect?). Mira Sorvino offers game support as a sidekick and 
pseudo-romantic interest; she's given more to do than just tagalong, and 
ends up owning the movie's best scene and line ("Are you gonna put a bullet 
in your head now that our positions are reversed?"). The villains, however, 
are too underdeveloped or silly to be much fun, especially the replacement 
killers of the title; when they strut in slo-mo into an airport decked out 
in black leather, greasy hair, facial scars and nasty scowls, you wonder why 
customs doesn't just snatch them up right there. 
While "The Replacement Killers" isn't challenging or even remotely 
thrilling, it sure isn't boring. Terrific visuals, a smooth color palette, a 
handful of strong sequences and the performances of Yun-Fat and Sorvino make 
the movie far from a dull sit. And that super-fast 88 minutes (you could fit 
two showings of this into one of "The Postman," and still have a couple 
seconds for a bathroom stop) earns "The Replacement Killers" a fraction of a 
star alone. The movie is a tiny blessing in disguise -- underneath the 
imperfect trappings lies a film that knows it's just about the ride and 
doesn't throw in any needless padding. When looking for a mild diversion, 
who could ask for anything more?

This movie is not directed by John Woo, but has Woo written all over it.
There are lots of Woo imitators floating about in celluloid land and
Antoine Fuqua is one of them. Fortunately, he is one of the better ones.
What we have is a mesh of slowed action sequences entangled with rapid
gunfire, the poetic stances of action puppets used to riddle each other
with passing bullets, whilst dressed in dark traditional overcoats now
the trade mark of Hong Kong action movies come to Hollywood. Not to
mention the poor lighting, dark sets, gloomy overcast skies and rainy
nights with a huge numbers of smoke, steam and wind generators and the
resident demolition expert to blow up every available automobile,
building and/or anything which stands or which closely resembles
suchand all in a single breath!
Excuse the static, but the plot goes - Chow/Sorvino (passports) 
Chinese Triad Clash (bullets fly)  Police (too late)  Chow/Sorvino
(family talk)  Triad Clash (lots of explosions)  Police (too late
again)  Chow/Sorvino (Buddha, family, save boy)  Triad Clash (more
bullets and explosions)  Police (Where are they?). Is there a recurring
theme somewhere in here?
The first time I saw Chow Yun Fat was 15 years ago  staring in a
Cantonese soap opera To Catch Good People in a Net'. This soapie had
most people in Hong Kong, Canton and Shang-Hai including all my Aunts
tuned to their TV sets every night. If you've ever seen a Chinese
soapie, you will understand that it is synonymous with the word tragedy.
The point of the entire exercise is to bring grief beyond belief and a
rainstorm of tears to your eyes. I haven't seen any of Chow's movies
between now and then, but I can say he hasn't changed much. Chow's
English isn't very good and fortunately he is given little to say except
for a few monosyllable sentences to express grief, pain or anger. The
lack of dialogue from Chow is otherwise adequately compensated by
Sorvino, gunfire and loud explosions. Mira Sorvino shows us once again
that she is not a babe or actress to be messed with, reprising the tough
girl image first seen in MIMIC.
Overall, this movie has some brilliant action sequences, but is
otherwise too repetitious for my liking.

For a good ten years or so, super cool Chow Yun Fat has enjoyed god
hood status in the Hong Kong Action Scene.  Now, he has followed in
the footsteps of Director John Woo, (who launched Chow's super stardom
in the acclaimed 'A Better Tomorrow') by moving to Hollywood.  I had
some reservations about this move and it would seem I was right to
have them.
Chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt.  His
final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy.  This
he refuses do and runs.  However, he is forced into a violent
confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers
are brought in to do the job.
Cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot-
outs which take place in various locations.  Some thought had gone
into  making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being
just plain boring.  The car wash scene, I found myself laughing at how
stupid it looked. Tut tut.  The emphasis during the constant action
seemed to be on the accompanying music, (I could have sworn one piece
was ripped out of a Bruckheimer movie) and not on the content. Mia
Sorvino (a passport forger) is dragged into the affay and also
provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a
gun.  
Director Antoine Arqua has clearly not observed Chow's excellent
acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of
broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots.  Chow's
trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale (which in
fairness is quite good) and there's not even a toothpick in site. And
as for making Chow shoot like a cop, well that's damned unforgiveable.
To round up, The Replacement Killers is a pretty darned lame first
outing for Chow.  It would appear he has left Asia for a 90 minute pop
video.  This is not what we wanted at all, considering John Woo was
the exec producer. (did he have NO say so at all?)   Watch 'The
Killer' again and weep at the difference. 
Review by Chris Hill.
"There's room at the top, they are telling you still,
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill,
if you want to be like the folks on the hill."

** (out of 4) Maybe it was the caterer they used on the production of THE
REPLACEMENT KILLERS. Perhaps a Folgers saboteur infiltrated and switched
coffees, replacing regular with decaf. That might explain why nobody put
much effort into the making of this movie.  
Zeedo (Michael Rooker), a cop, breaks up a big drug deal and kills the
kingpin who will not surrender. The kingpin's father, the local Chinese
godfather, naturally wants revenge.  
John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat), in debt to the godfather, is assigned to
assassinate Zeedo's 10-year old son. Lee gets the kid in his sites but finds
he doesn't have the heart to kill a child. 
Refusing the godfather's assignment will mean death if he stays in town, so
Lee tries to leave the country by getting a passport from forger Meg Coburn
(Mira Sorvino). Before Lee can get his passport, the godfather's henchmen
track him to Coburn's apartment, and wreck the place. Lee and Coburn take it
on the lam.  
The plot doesn't sound AWFUL, but it certainly doesn't sound original. The
other components of this movie are the same way: they're workable, if not
original, but they lack the shine of elbow grease.  
For instance, the bad guys are introduced as drug dealers. Drug dealers in
an action movie might as well be made of catsup-filled cardboard. No action
movie criminal is less interesting or less threatening than a drug dealer.
These guys are dressed for perfectly for the role, wearing expensive suits
and dark shades. They are wealthy, smooth, and deadly. Years of the TV show
COPS showing us wiry, ugly, nervous drug dealers hasn't scratched the
surface of this movie stereotype yet. A token twist on this archetype would
have helped the movie immensely, but it was apparently too much effort. 
Then there was a potentially interesting cat and mouse sequence in a car
wash, but Fuqua and editor Jay Lash Cassidy minced it. Quickly-cut closeups
of blazing guns, and the lack of any sort of establishing shot, ensured that
the audience wouldn't have any idea what was going on. It looked
interesting, but it had no real meaning until we saw who was left standing.
It would have been better to choreograph the whole sequence, but that takes
more work. It's easier to just splice lots of quick shots of guns, which
they did.  
Later, after a don't-think-but-act super shootout, the bad guys get the drop
on our heroes. Do they kill them in the heat of the moment? Of course not.
Instead, they calm down enough to reveal their evil plans. It would be
better to let the heroes learn about the plans through their own ingenuity
and cunning, but it's easier to just write a scene where the bad guys spill
their guts and leave the heroes for dead.  
There are some parts of the movie that are just plain bad. No amount of
effort is likely to have helped the immature dialogue or the flat emotion.
For example, the godfather is very deeply moved by the death of his child,
so deeply that he vows a personal revenge. His grief takes the form of a
four-word segue: "A child is irreplaceable... which brings me to your task..."  
Occasionally the movie makes the mistake of asking for emotional
involvement. An officer is killed, a child is threatened. But these shallow
attempts to elicit feelings are a waste of time in a movie with such callous
and deadly killing. Real emotion is hard to put into an action movie. It's
easier to sprinkle in a dab so you know what the characters' motivations
are. It would have been better to leave it out entirely.  
Eventually the movie picks up a bit. When Meg and Lee are on the run, the
pace is good and they get to do some fun butt-kicking. Mira is eventually
allowed to hold a gun and pull the trigger a few times. A shootout in a
theater was tense and exciting.  
Also, the action cinematography was pretty good. The camera takes some
interesting points of view. In the car wash sequence, Yun-Fat polishes off a
drug dealer from an oil-change creeper. The opening sequence shows Yun-Fat
from an extremely low angle, making him an immensely imposing figure. It's
too bad that these shots weren't edited any better, because in and of
themselves, they looked pretty good.  
But these factors are not enough to make THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS worth seeing.  
I should admit that I didn't mind watching the movie. The experience itself
was average, kind of fun. I even thought I might give this movie a
break-even rating while I was watching it. But I realize I was waiting for
the one scene or sequence that was going to leave me satisfied. A few came
close, but when it was all over, that moment never came.  
If I may be permitted a bit of deconstruction, I found it interesting that
after all Meg and Lee went through, they parted with longing looks and
without so much as a hug. Compare this to what happens after James Bond and
Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) finish off their bad guys in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. I
think it's safe to say that good old semi-prude hypocritical America is okay
with white men making it with oriental women. But audiences are expected to
be uncomfortable with non-Anglo men making it with "our" pretty blond white
women. I was disappointed but I was not surprised.

Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat follows the lead set by Jackie Chan
and Hong Kong directors such as John Woo, Tsui Hark and Stanley Tong in
attempting to cross over to the American mainstream.  With The
Replacement Killers, he has a vehicle that captures the style of a Hong
Kong action-fest, but with none of the substance.
Chow Yun-Fat plays assassin John Lee.  He's indebted to a crimelord, Mr.
Wei (Kenneth Tsang), and must perform three hits or his mother and
sister will be killed back in China.  John performs two of his three
kills, but on the third the sight of a cop (Michael Rooker) playing with
his young son makes him reconsider, and he abandons his task.
This, of course, greatly angers Mr. Wei, who calls in replacement
killers to finish the job, and to finish Mr. Lee.  He, on the other
hand, has no intention on being rubbed out.  He sets off to return to
China, in order to save his family, but he needs forged papers to do
so.  To that end, he enlists the aid of rogue forger Meg Coburn (Mira
Sorvino), and when her lab is destroyed by Wei's henchmen, their fates
are intertwined. So, John and Meg set out to nullify the replacement
killers, protect their target, eliminate Mr. Wei, thereby saving Lee's
family.
The first problem with The Replacement Killers is with Yun-Fat.  His
hitman is a flimsy construct at best, and makes Clint Eastwood's Man
With No Name seem wordy.  We learn very little about him, but the worst
part is we don't want to know.  With less emotional range than The
Terminator, his hitman exists as merely a machine to expel bullets at
the bad guys. Mira Sorvino fares better, but only slightly.  She seems
out of place here, but at least she's given a meatier character than
Yun-Fat.
Director Antoine Fuqua applies plenty of stylistic touches to the action
sequences. Some of the setups, though, are too obvious.  When the camera
swoops majestically down a tile corridor and into some hybrid of a
warehouse and an automatic car wash, you just know that a gun battle is
going to take place on this terrain.  When the bullets unavoidably begin
flying, the resulting carnage is shot with relish. A wide variety of
angles, lighting and camera speeds are employed to enliven the action.
At some points, the technique works, but most of the time, the
overbearing style is layered on too thickly.  In the middle of an
exciting action sequence, you shouldn't be noticing the excellent use of
discrete surround channels or the appropriately mysterious lighting
used...those things should simply enhance the atmosphere. Here, they're
noticeable.
And the film is in serious trouble when it has to fall back on its plot
to redeem itself. I was hard pressed to fill two paragraphs above with a
plot summary.  There are no twists and/or turns.  Nothing unexpected
happens.  The plot is a vehicle to move from one shoot-out to another,
nothing more.
It's a pity.  The best Hong Kong action films have plots that put most
American actioners to shame.  It's not the most auspicious American
debut for Chow Yun-Fat, and he deserves much better than this.

Chow Yun-Fat makes his American movie debut in a shoot 'em up Hong
Kong-themed action thriller co-starring Quentin Tarantino's main
squeeze from the days of shooting, Mira Sorvino. This film is also the
first for music-video director (see Little Known Facts below) gone
movie director Antoine Fuqua.
PLOT:
Hitman Lee (Yun-Fat) must kill a police officer's son for his gangster
boss Mr. Wei. Before he kills the child, he develops a conscience, and
skips his task of murder. Mr. Wei is not happy with his killer
employee, and sends in some "replacement killers" to finish him off, as
well as the cop's kid. Lee must do battle with other killers, while
attempting to return home to his endangered family in China, with the
assistance of passport forger Coburn (Sorvino).
CRITIQUE:
Do you like guns? Do you like the gunplay? If your answers to the
previous two questions were a resounding "yes", then I suggest you get
up off your ass, jog over to your nearest video store, and rent this
gun smokin' fun-fest! If you're one that enjoys the plot of a movie,
the deep characterization of man and woman, and the existential meaning
of life, then I suggest you remain seated, and move onto another
review. This bullet-emblazoned film is all noize and explosions, and
anything but stimulus for your cerebral matter.
This movie is also filmed like a MTV music video, with the required hip
eclectic soundtrack, a dark moody look with sporadic use of green and
red filters, and the obligatory Tony Scott-famed rainfall. It also
boasts the required short runtime (less than 90 minutes- flat), an
extreme use of slo-motion when the bullets and the bodies are a-flyin',
and the less than impressive emphasis on plot. If there was a plot,
that is. Oh yeah, hitman develops conscience: Now, let's kill hitman.
Slap in some Sorvino running around in a bra for most of the film, and
you've got yourself a nacho-munching fool-fest for all those willing to
drop their brains off at the door (Guilty as charged.)
Yun-Fat's rookie American performance is also pretty lame in this
movie, with his entire dialogue based around three word monotone
sentences. Michael Rooker as the good cop plays Michael Rooker as the
good cop, and the rest of the cast is basically just a heap of bodies
to be counted later. Did I mention that there were a lot of gunfights?
In the tradition of the master himself, John Woo (co-executive producer
on this one), Fuqua also wastes no time in between gunplay scenes. Fat
walks into a hotel. Gun fight. Fat walks into an arcade. Gun fight. Fat
walks into a car wash. Gun fight. Highly stylized gunfights mind you,
but perpetual gunfights nonetheless. All in all, this is the kind of
stuff that seems to be receding our kids into the lobotomous zones that
we recognize them in sometimes. On the other hand, if this is your
taste of salsa, don't let me stand in the way of a man, his cheese and
his monster bag o' nachos!

        Have you noticed nowadays how many movie previews push the name of
the director almost as much the film's principal actors?  "A film by Tony
Scott" or "A Mike Nichols film" the guy with the mouthful of marbles will
state confidently at the end of the preceding montage.
        I would tend to guess that most people who drag their carcasses out
to their local megaplex on a Saturday night couldn't care less who
*directed* the film they're about to see.  Half of them don't even care
who's *in* it.
        And so to "The Replacement Killers."  The voice-over at the end of
its television trailer somberly announces "Directed by Antoine Fuqua."
Antoine who?  Like, does anyone know who Antoine Fuqua *is*?  (No.)  Has he
directed anything of note before?  (No.)  Has he directed *anything*
before?  (Yes, a music video.)  So what's the point?
        The point, unfortunately, is that "The Replacement Killers" *isn't*
a film by John Woo.
        Woo is the acclaimed Hong Kong filmmaker responsible for some
highly kinetic action pictures on that side of the globe.  His films are
spectacularly staged ballistic ballets with, frequently, an ageless,
charismatic leading actor called Chow Yun-Fat caught somewhere in the
middle.  Movies like "A Better Tomorrow," "The Killer", and the sensational
"Hard-Boiled."  Then Woo came to the States and made a couple of duds, "Hard
Target" (with Jean-Claude Van Damme--no surprise there) and "Broken Arrow."
Then he finally redeemed himself with last summer's "Face/Off."  Next he's
executive producing a comedy/actioner of sorts, "The Big Hit," "a Kirk Wong
film."
        "The Replacement Killers" certainly *looks* like it could be a John
Woo film. (It should; he executive produced this one too.)  For starters it
stars Chow Yun-Fat.  And it's choc-o-bloc with scenes of hit men (and Mira
Sorvino!) flying through the air with both barrels blazing.  But there the
comparisons end.
        The action sequences, of which there are many, are not particularly
well staged, or crafted.  They're just there.  Ad nauseum.  The plot, too,
is relatively untaxing--hoods hound Chow when Chow reneges on hit; Chow
drags Sorvino's forger around town as security for ticket back to mainland
China to save family; Chow and Sorvino get shot at a lot--and it simply
allows for more of those understaged, sub-crafted shoot-outs.  As for
style, Fuqua's approach seems to be black=cool.  Witness Chow's sunglasses
(indoors!), the shadowy exteriors, the leather garb of the title
characters, and Sorvino's constantly exposed undergarments (she's supposed
to be tough and we know that tough chicks like to hang around in their
underwear, even when they're working, right?).
        Chow and Sorvino make a respectable pairing, and even Jürgen
Prochnow ("Das Boot") is suitably well-dressed and oily in a throwaway
henchman role.  When the replacement killers (cuz Chow reneged, remember?)
track the good guys down to a crowded video arcade and start shooting, all
of a sudden there's nobody around.  Where'd everybody go?  And why the heck
didn't Chow and Sorvino go with them!?  It's logic like that that leaves
"The Replacement Killers" in the gutter time and time again.
        Now that Chow Yun-Fat has crossed the ocean it would be nice to see
him handling something a little more sophisticated than a pair of firearms
(perhaps tinkling the old ivories like Clint Eastwood did in "In the Line
of Fire"?).  If you're planning on seeing Antoine Fuqua's film, let me
suggest any Woo/Chow movie on videotape as a replacement.

For fans of Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat, the greatest
anticipation is for his first English words in a Hollywood film: "My
condolences."
In a premiere showing, the crowd cheered. All hail the king! Chow, who
attended the premiere, said he was so nervous his first day on the
set, that he was unable to get the words out. It didn't help that he
was without a gun in each hand.
For those who haven't heard of Chow, he is one of the biggest names in
Asian cinema rivaled only by Jackie Chan. Chow made his debut in
director John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow" (1986), which became the
top-grossing film in Hong Kong history. Since Britain relinquished its
sovereignty over Hong Kong last year to China, it was only a matter of
time before Chow crashed our shores.
Like "A Better Tomorrow," he's done it with a bang in a slick, action
thriller, "The Replacement Killers," directed by first-timer Antoine
Fuqua and co-produced by Woo and his long-time partner Terence
Chang. Woo made his Hollywood debut with "Hard Target" (1993) and more
recently helmed "Face/Off" last summer.
Chow stars with Mira Sorvino as two toughies on the run from the
Chinese mob in L.A. Sorvino is an un-Romylike loser, who helps forge a
passport for assassin John Lee (Chow) after Lee becomes a marked man
for refusing an assignment. Sorvino, the girlfriend of gun-happy
director Quentin Tarantino, is the toughest bad girl since "La Femme
Nikita." Tarantino, a long-time admirer of Chow, used HK Chow films
like "City on Fire" and "A Better Tomorrow III" as the inspiration for
"Reservoir Dogs."
"The Replacement Killers" features an impressive debut by Fuqua, shot
by cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister and includes a thrilling
score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Ken Sanzel wrote the script,
rewritten especially for Chow.
Fuqua was wise in trying not to copy Woo's over-the-top directing
style, given the fact that the master actionmaker stood nearby as a
producer. Woo and Chang were wise to let Fuqua develop his own
visionary mayhem.
Fuqua's influence is from the Bruckheimer School of Film, named after
the producer of "Beverly Hills Cop" and "Top Gun" where visuals are
everything and plot comes later. Early disciples from commercial TV
included the Scott brothers, Ridley and Tony, and Adrian Lyne
("Flashdance"). The current generation of former music video directors
consists of Michael Bay ("Bad Boys," "The Rock"), Simon West ("Con
Air") and Alex Proyas ("The Crow," "Dark City"). The fast-paced action
is furious, shots last milliseconds before edits, the camera is
constantly moving and the lighting is always in contrast between dark
shadows and warm blue hues, usually with dry ice from somewhere
filling up the screen for atmospheric reasons only.
Fuqua gives "The Replacement Killers" a slick, quick-edit look,
especially during the opening shootout in a nightclub. The scene
concludes with Fuqua's version of the famous mirror shot from Robert
Clouse's "Enter the Dragon" with Bruce Lee. It's an example of why
Fuqua's debut stands out. With Collister's assistance, he has created
his own visual style, while also adding a few tributes from Woo's
masterpiece, "The Killer," such as slow-motion walks, the sliding
gunslinger and using a church or temple as a headquarters for the hero
signifying peaceful tranquility in a violent world.
 Given Chow's limitations due to learning English, Fuqua sticks with
what Chow knows best. Minimal dialogue with plenty of hail Mary
gunfire. A shootout at a car wash is on par with some of HK films'
best shootout scenes such as the opening teahouse massacre in Woo's
"Hard-Boiled" or the concluding raid on a warehouse in Ringo Lam's
"City on Fire."
"The Replacement Killers," the title refers to the assassins brought
in to kill Lee, goes into motion early on when Detective Stan Zedkov
(Michael Rooker) breaks up a drug shipment involving the son of crime
boss Terence Wei (Kenneth Tsang). After Wei's son is killed by Zedkov,
Wei seeks revenge. Jurgen Prochnow stars as Wei's second in command.
The film will take your breath away, that is when you have time to
come up for air between all the blazing gunfire.
Rating: *** 1/2 (Three-and-a-half stars)

Rated R: Strong violence, language
by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
    I suppose there are different kinds of action films. Some action
films are straightforward, while, at the same time, they mock themselves
in self-consciousness because they know that action films are, by
definition, ludicrous. Films like Die Hard and The Rock fit nicely into
this category. The other significant category of action contains films
like The Replacement Killers and Face/Off--these films utilize
slow-motion, are very arty, very serious, and totally pretentious.
    I don't have a problem with pretentiousness, especially when we're
given actors, like Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino, who can pull it off. I
had a great time with The Replacement Killers, and the reasons for this
are very simple: it's an extremely well-crafted and energetic piece.
It's also the kind of stylish, Asian action picture that mainstream
American moviegoers don't see very often.
    Yun-Fat stars as John Lee, a deadly assassin. In the early scenes of
the film, a cop (Michael Rooker) is seen killing the son of Terence Wei
(Kenneth Tsang). Wei, in an act of brutal revenge, hires Lee to dispatch
of the cop's son. With the gun pointed at the seven year-old boy, Lee
has a morality attack and refuses to kill the kid. Knowing that his life
is in danger, Lee tries to get back to his family in China, so he goes
to Meg Coburn (Sorvino) who makes fake IDs.
    It doesn't take long for Wei's people to find Lee, and Lee is forced
to bring Meg with him on his adventures. At this point, Wei hires
killers to replace Lee and kill the boy. Meg convinces Lee that he has
to kill Wei and all of his men, or the boy will never be safe.
    Each review I read for this film speaks of an emotional void, a
complete emptiness in anything of substance. My disagreement with this
point is one of my central reasons for enjoying all of the pretentious
flair of the action sequences: in several scenes (like one terrific
moment during which Lee muses in a photo booth as his picture is being
taken), the characters are actually given time to develop. And the two
lead actors do great jobs of playing these people (Sorvino, once again,
gives dimension to a character who would have been less appealing if
played by most other actresses).
    However (and expectedly), I didn't watch the film for the
characters. Director Antoine Fuqua clearly knows what he's doing, and
the action here rivals most scenes staged by the maestro himself, John
Woo (who worked as executive producer of this film). The opening
scene--in which Lee kills a group of culprits in a nightclub--is one of
the better action sequences in recent memory. All of the action in the
film is overflowing with that sharp style, filled with close-ups of
guns, and slow-motion so we can see the graphic deaths and viscera in
all of their detail. The pounding soundtrack also propels the film into
an eclectic state that disallowed me from ever looking away.
    I would have enjoyed this film more if I hadn't been hung-up on the
central irony that was apparently overlooked (or simply ignored) by
writer Ken Sanzel--this is a film about an assassin who takes mercy upon
a young boy, and basically goes through a morality revolution. But
never, in all of the scenes in which he blows away dozens of thugs, does
he ever show any kind of remorse. True, they are trying to kill him, but
in two specific scenes he has the villains at his mercy, and he executes
them anyway. This seems thoughtless to me, and tells me that maybe some
of the more thoughtful elements that I observed in the film were
accidental.
    But who really cares about that, anyway? This is an action film--an
exciting, engaging, and flashy action film. It has Chow Yun-Fat, and
Mira Sorvino, and techno music, and gunfire, and blood, and lots and
lots of slow-motion. It's fun to watch, it got my blood flowing, and I
recommend it based on these very simple criteria.

     In these days of high-tech special effects and big screen derring-
do, watchable action films typically come in one of two categories:  
those that tell a good story and those that don't tell much of a story, 
but look good all the same.  THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, Chow Yun-Fat's 
entrance into American multiplexes, falls squarely in the latter 
category.  The plot is so thin that it's not really worth thinking 
about, but director Antoine Fuqua and cinematographer Peter Lyons 
Collister have put so much effort into the feel and appearance of the 
movie that it held my attention.
     Like Jackie Chan several years ago, actor Chow Yun-Fat is 
internationally revered but hardly known in the United States.  That's 
because his career has thrived in Hong Kong, and motion picture exports 
from that country rarely find more than a token audience of devotees in 
this one.  However, as part of the mass cinema talent exodus from Hong 
Kong last year, Chow joined former director John Woo on this side of the 
Atlantic, and, with Woo acting as an executive producer, THE REPLACEMENT 
KILLERS was born.  
     As I said, there isn't much of a story -- just a flimsy excuse to 
connect a number of kinetic action sequences.  This is truly a "flashes 
and bangs" motion picture -- albeit a gorgeous-looking one.  Chow plays 
John Lee, one of the world's premiere assassins.  When he refuses to 
fulfill a contract that requires him to kill the son of police officer 
Stan Zedkov (Michael Rooker), he earns the enmity of Chinese mob boss 
Wei (Kenneth Tsang).  In his flight from Wei, Lee enlists the aid of a 
forger, Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), who gets more than she bargained for.  
Soon, the two of them are on the run, with the police and hired killers 
on their trail.
     The director of this movie is Antoine Fuqua, but a viewer could be 
forgiven for thinking it's John Woo.  The action sequences all have the 
same kind of choreographed style evident in Woo's films, even to the 
point where moments are shamelessly pilfered from two Woo/Chow 
collaborations, THE KILLER and HARD BOILED.  The presentation of THE 
REPLACEMENT KILLERS is also very Woo-like, featuring the meticulous use 
of light and shadow, and a rich palette of colors that saturate certain 
scenes with reds, ambers, greens, and blues.  With the nearly non-stop 
action and the constant visual stimulation, it's virtually impossible to 
be bored by THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS.
     Chow literally strides into his first American film like a god.  
Fuqua films the actor's first appearance as befits a living legend, 
showing him walking purposely across the floor of a dance club.  He's a 
figure in a suit and sunglasses, with strobe lights and smoke all around 
him.  It's a moment that cries out "Cool!"  Then the action -- which is 
mostly gunfire -- begins.  One thing that disappointed me about THE 
REPLACEMENT KILLERS is that Chow, whose stature as a mega-action star 
belies his legitimate acting talent, isn't given a chance to show any 
dramatic range.  John Lee is a generic character -- Jean-Claude Van 
Damme could have done almost as well with this limited role.  Similarly, 
Mira Sorvino isn't offered much to do except look tough, run around 
after Chow, and occasionally shoot someone.  
     The terms "eye candy" and "testosterone flick" were coined for 
movies like THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS -- mildly entertaining features that 
don't amount to much.  It's all sound and fury signifying nothing.  
Nothing, that is, except the arrival of Chow Yun-Fat into the American 
mainstream.  If he makes any kind of impact, the action genre will never 
be quite the same.

feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"

After a few hours of moving furniture, the urge to do something else
took over, so my friend and I went to the matinee of _The Replacement
Killers_, the latest Hong Kong action film to be shot in the US.
Now, semanticians out there will quibble with my last statement... if
it was shot in the US, how can it be a Hong Kong film?  Well, you see
that many of the internationally acclaimed directors, writers, and
actors of HK's booming film business left that country for the US in
the last couple of years before HK went back to China.  So, a film
effectively done under the same people with the same actors here is
still, effectively, a HK film.
_The Replacement Killers_ (TRK for short) is definitely effective.
I left the theatre thinking that TRK was "John Woo"-lite.  There is
much to be said for that argument -- the film was executive produced
by Woo and many of the action scenes directly quote Woo's earlier
work.  If you're into John Woo drinking games, you'd be drunk by the
end of this movie.  What the film in missing, however, is a story.
The plot is there, but its really just a metal clothes-hanger upon
which an mobile of stupendous gun fight scenes can be hung.  Chow
Yun-Fat (star of Woo's _The Killer_) plays a hit-man, John Lee, with
obligations to Mr. Wei, a Chinese mob boss.  After a cop kills Wei's
son, Lee is sent on a mission against the cop.  His ethics get in the
way, so he tried to flee town with the help of Mira Sorvino's Meg, a
designer of fake IDs.  The two of them become partners in a campaign
to take down Mr. Wei after spending most of a day dodging Wei's goons.
The effectiveness of the movie isn't in its poetry or its emotion.
Leave that to Woo.  This movie is ninety minutes of stylized
gunfights, and they are done quite well.  You won't see the amazing
physical feats of a Jackie Chan movie, but you will see lightning fast
reflexes and great choreography.  Mira even does a great job in her
first big action role.  There is no ounce of helplessness in her
character, just big-hearted toughness.
In conclusion, this is a very effective pastiche of Hong Kong's
stylized violence.  It's not filmmaking on the level of the best of
HK, but it fills the gap until we get to see the next Woo film.  On my
[-4, +4] scale, it gets a solid +2.
P.S. One final bit of trivia... what does TRK have in common with
Egoyan's _The Sweet Hereafter_?  A scene in an automatic carwash.

Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor from Hong Kong, largely known for
his incredible work with John Woo.  But, like all other things that are not
American, he's not known well here in the US.  The Replacement Killers aims
to change that.  But, can it?
John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) is a hitman for hire.   Asian crime syndicate boss,
Terrance Wei (Kenneth Tsang),  wants the son of police officer Stan Zedkov
(Michael Rooker) dead.  Wei hires Lee to do the hit, but* while Lee has
cross-hairs trained on the young boy, he's unable to do the job.  John Lee
might be a killer for hire, but there are things that he cannot do.  Wei
finds this unacceptable and Wei, now gone mad, wants a lot of blood.  Wei
brings in the replacement killers.  While trying to make a run out of the
US, Lee needs the help of Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino) who is a master
document forger.
That's as far as the story goes.  The script by Ken Sanzel is weak and
flimsy.  It's an excuse for first-time director Anton Fuqua to move from
action scene to action scene.  Chow Yun-Fat is given only a handful of
lines to perform and the rest of the film is him running around with dual
pistols.
I mentioned earlier that Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor.  I stress
the word actor.  It seems like in the case of The Replacement Killers,
Hollywood has tried to boil Chow Yun-Fat down to just a typical "action
hero."  This is a sad thing to do, for Chow Yun-Fat is more than just that.
Anton Fuqua, a former music video director, tries hard to pay homage to
John Woo (who is one of the producers.)  It's unfortunate that rookie Fuqua
is unable to create the same type of action that master Woo can.  Fuqua
uses all sorts of Woo's tricks including Woo's signature slow-mo shots.
But, the feel of Fuqua's direction is purely mechanical.  And this
mechanical feeling goes all around; from actors to production crew.
Everyone seems to be "just going through the motions."
Yes, there are a lot of action sequences, but the problem is that Fuqua is
never able to inject the adrenaline into the sequences.  The sequences are
highly derivative and flat.
There were no real memorable action sequences from The Replacement Killers.
The action flies from office, to restaurants, to car washes, and to dance
clubs without any real connection to them.  I think that the movie would
have worked out if the characters weren't so one dimensional.  Mira
Sorvino's Meg is bland and we don't seem to care about her. Chow Yun-Fat's
John Lee is equally bland.  My test for bland action heroes? Easy: if the
hero gets shot in the shoulder (where most action heroes get shot) does the
audience cringe in sympathetic pain, or not?  I didn't cringe when John Lee
was shot in the shoulder.
The one redeeming quality of The Replacement Killers is the studio's
perceived big selling point of the film, Chow Yun-Fat. Though he is not
given enough to do to show how good of an actor he really is, he brings a
sort of charm and grace to his part.  It's hard to describe Chow Yun-Fat
and the way that he is onscreen.  He is suave, cool, and smooth.  And he
just looks good with two pistols in hand.  I just wish the script had more
for Chow Yun-Fat to do.
It's hard for me to recommend a mediocre action film like The Replacement
Killers.  If it had not been for the presence of the ever-cool Chow
Yun-Fat, there would be no merit to this film.  But, since this is the
first American Chow Yun-Fat film, it serves as an introduction to him for
many.  And for that reason, I lightly recommend this film.  The Replacement
Killers plays like it should logically play from a music video director, if
you really think about it. The movie feels like a ninety minute music
video.  See this film at a matinee showing or on video.
If you think that Chow Yun-Fat is cool and would like to see more of him,
check out some of these older films that he did with John Woo.  I would
recommend these Woo/Fat films:  The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, and my
ever-favourite Hard-Boiled.  These films will wow you more than The
Replacement Killers.
