The Vietnam War has proven to be an irresistable subject for
noted Hollywood directors.  The carnage, the waste, and the
illogic behind the war (in order to stop communism in a small,
dirt-poor nation, it is proper to devastate it and kill much
of the population) makes for more than an allegory of might
and morality gone astray.  It is a setting for excellent
cinematography, and the tension latent to having nervous
rifle-toting faceless teenagers (often played by much older
famous actors) face violent death just around the corner.
Each director has his own spin on the war.  Stanley Kubrick
in "Full Metal Jacket" looks for irony.  Michael Cimino in
"The Deer Hunter" finds terror and torture in a P.O.W. camp.
Oliver Stone in "Platoon" is concerned with ethics and
power struggles.  Francis Ford Coppola in "Apocalypse Now"
sees the war as a bad acid trip, surreal and deadly.
It is ironic that "Apocalypse Now" begins and ends with
the Doors' "The End".  Ironic, because both the song and
the movie are good despite a surreal and somewhat incoherent
style.  Perhaps it would have been more fitting if Marlon
Brando's final words were "what a mess" rather than
"the horror".
Martin Sheen plays a soldier whose new assignment is to
go to Cambodia and kill a renegade colonel (Marlon Brando)
who has gone insane and is worshipped as a god by his
stoned troops.  Rather than parachuting Sheen into the
Cambodian jungle by plane, which would make too much sense,
the plot has him taking a slow boat ride down a deadly
river to Cambodia with several troubled young soldiers.
(Admittedly, this makes for increased plot tension and
excellent cinematography.)
Along the way, Sheen encounters Robert Duvall as a
Lt. Colonel more interested in surfing and male bonding than
in military strategy.  Duvall has one of his goofiest roles,
and is given great lines like "Charlie don't surf" and
"I love the smell of napalm in the morning".
With most of the film leading up to Sheen's confrontation
with the insane colonel, it is a letdown that the colonel
turns out to be bald, bloated and blithering Marlon Brando.
Brando's character is fond of reading aloud sheets of paper
that have all the wisdom of "Zippy the Pinhead" comic strips.
My favorite part of "Apocalypse Now" is the U.S.O. show,
which I have always associated with the likes of Bob Hope
and Martha Raye.  Instead, we get Playmate of the Year
Cynthia Wood, who dances and teases the hard-up young
soldiers until they mob the stage, forcing the dancers to
make a panicked exit by helicopter.
"Apocalypse Now" was a troubled Phillipines production that
took over a year to film and went well over budget.
A hurricane wiped out the set, Martin Sheen had a heart
attack, Marlon Brando proved uncooperative, and the helicopters
(ironically) were sometimes taken away by Marcos to fight
guerillas.

Twenty-two years after Francis Ford Coppola finished his masterpiece, APOCALYPSE
NOW, he has recut the film, adding in almost an extra hour of footage into a new
version titled APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX.  Although it runs over three-and-a-quarter
hours, it feels shorter than your average hour and a half movie.  It is so
mesmerizing that I kept forgetting to shift in my seat, causing posterior to
start to hurt.                
APOCALYPSE NOW is the big movie that Francis Ford Coppola originally wanted to
make, but he had to make THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER: PART 2 first in order
to get the studio backing and the money.  The filming was a disaster in about
every way imaginable, including being struck by a typhoon.  The result was that
it took him 16 months rather than the scheduled 6 weeks to complete the filming.
 By the end, Coppola was broke and had lost 100 pounds, but he finally had his
magnum opus finished.
As the story opens, we meet Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a man way past his
breaking point.  Willard is played brilliantly by Martin Sheen, who had a heart
attack during the filming.  The genius of the film comes almost as much from
Sheen as Coppola.  In particular, Sheen's intimate, diary-like narration is the
best part of the movie.  The film's script is by John Milius and Francis Ford
Coppola, inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.  (The film's title
appears only in graffiti, very late in the film.  There are absolutely no
opening credits.)
"For my sins, they gave me a mission," Willard tells us sadly and fatalistically
in voice-over as, drunk and bloody, he crashes around his Saigon hotel room.  A
former CIA operative, Willard is tired, very tired and hopeless.
A very young and awkward Harrison Ford, as Colonel G Lucas, gives Willard his
assignment.  Lucas orders Willard to terminate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon
Brando).  "Terminate with extreme prejudice," a man identified only as a
civilian (Jerry Ziesmer) clarifies the orders.  After this, Lucas adds, "You
understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist nor will it ever exist." 
Willard boards a small boat to go way up river into Cambodia in order to locate
Kurtz.  Willard exists in a world of his own.  He doesn't belong in Vietnam,
but, after having recently gone home, he realizes that he doesn't belong there
anymore either.  He feels quite different from the young soldiers on the small
boat with him.  They smoke dope and drop acid as they head through deadly
territory.  A 14-year-old "Larry" Fishburne (THE MATRIX) plays one of these
solders.
Willard wonders why they want Kurtz killed.  Is it just politics?  The more he
reads about Kurtz from his dossier, the more he comes to admire him.  Dennis
Hopper, as a spaced-out, freelance photographer, calls Kurtz, "a poet warrior in
the classic sense."
Along the way, Willard meets Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), an
officer nicknamed "Big Duke."  With his large hat, golden ascot and the looks of
a GQ model, Kilgore is a fearless soldier who thinks no bullet can touch him and
who prides himself on taking care of his men.  He's also a huge surfing fan. 
When he finds the perfect wave, at least as perfect as can be found in Vietnam,
he orders his surfers to suit up.  But since this is in the middle of a battle,
the napalm, much to Kilgore's chagrin, spoils the wind and hence the surf.  
One of the film's most impressive visuals is of Kilgore's air cavalry
helicopters coming in to bomb and strafe a village.  As they swoop down from the
skies, Kilgore orders "The Ride Of The Valkyries" to be played loudly on the
helicopter's loudspeakers in order to scare the villagers.
With sweeping vistas, incredible sound effects and dramatic music and with
soldiers seen frequently in mud, blood, sweat and war paint, Coppola paints a
surrealistic view of the war from realistic parts.  This is in contrast to
another brilliant war movie, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which Spielberg made equally
horrifying using photorealism.  
One of the many added scenes in APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX is one with Playboy bunnies
in which the young soldiers try to pose them in the same position as they were
in their centerfold pictures.  It comes off sadly touching.
This hell on earth is best described by one of the men deep in the jungle who
tells Willard, "You're in the asshole of the world."  Willard keeps encountering
leaderless troops, which can be viewed as a metaphor for the Vietnam War
itself.
Keep an eye out for Coppola in a cameo.  He appears as a television director who
instructs Willard to act natural during a firefight since they are filming it.
The question for reviewers is whether to evaluate APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX on its
own or compare it to the original.  Since it has been too long since I've seen
the original, I'll evaluate it on its own.  It's an incredible film and a
classic, but it's not quite perfect.  A lot less of Brando would have been
better, and the film's last act isn't as good as the rest of the picture.  But
still it is an amazing achievement worth many viewings.  Whatever you do, don't
pass on the probably brief opportunity to see APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX on the big
screen.
APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX runs a surprisingly short feeling 3:17 (not including the
ending credits).  The film is rated R for disturbing violent images, language,
sexual content and some drug use and would be acceptable for older teenagers.
The film opens in limited engagement in the United States on Friday, August 10,
2001.

Everyone knows about the Oscar-winning 1979 film "Apocalypse Now" and, if
you're a film nut like me, also about the trials and tribulations of that
problem plagued production. Years in the making, the film was released, to
both critical and popular acclaim, in a 150 minute version. It is a film
that is easily a member of the top 100 films of all times club. But, as
with anything that has dollar signs attached to it, the filmmakers decided
to re-cut the film, restoring footage that fell to the cutting room floor
more than two decades ago and, like the phoenix rising from the ashes,
giving Francis Ford Coppola the chance to show us his "real vision" in
"Apocalypse Now Redux."
Longer does not necessarily make better and, sometimes, there is a reason
for scenes to be dropped in the editing process of a film that is an
artistic achievement like "Apocalypse Now." The original movie  - which, by
the way, ended with a B52 strike, an ending the was deleted after the
film's first run, a decision by the director because he felt the audience
would not understand his intent. I, personally, preferred the original
original - was not a perfect movie. The flaw lay in the theatricality when
Colonel Kurtz (the notorious Marlon Brando) enters the picture. Prior to
that, the road trip (well, river trip) that brings Captain Willard (Martin
Sheen) to the renegade colonel's lair is a varied, violent journey that
uses the backdrop of the failing American effort to stop Communism in
Vietnam.
The film, even the '79 version, is made up of a series of interludes
involving Willard and the crew of the Navy motor patrol boat assigned to
his secret mission, the kind of heavily-armed, plastic-bottomed boat that
prowled the rivers in search of Charlie on Vietnam's massive Mekong Delta.
We all remember the unforgettable Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his
Ride of the Valkyrie attack on the heavily-armed Viet Cong compound - "I
love the smell of napalm in the morning...it smells of victory" is a movie
line that is up there with "In all the gin joints in all the towns in all
the world she had to come into mine." Then there's the Playboy Bunny bit
and the last outpost scene and sampan sequence and more. So, with this
wealth of well done, beautifully shot (cinematography by Vittorio Storaro)
scenes that put a unique spin on the Joseph Conrad story, "Hearts of
Darkness," can it be made better? In a word, no.
The makers, led by Coppola and long-time collaborator, editor Walter Murch,
have reassembled the film from original unedited raw footage and included
not only missing scenes, but reedited and repositioned existing scenes, as
well. In my honest opinion, I liked the restructuring of the original movie
scenes the makers made. They give the individual sequences more clarity.
But the added, previously unseen, scenes do not work. The Colonel Kilgore
sequence is extended with Willard and company stealing the mad commander's
favored surfboard, introducing a mirth in Willard that doesn't fit the
character. The much-discussed French plantation sequence resolves some
things that were at loose ends in the original, but, overall, the added
footage is completely out of context to the rest of the film except to
narrate the past, war-ridden history of Vietnam and its colonization by the
French. Most of it feels like a personal travelogue that belongs in an
another film entirely.
An expanded Playboy playmate sequence that has Willard trading diesel fuel
for sexual favors for his crew goes against the grain and is introduced, I
think, because they had the T&A, so why not use it now? Otherwise, the
scene does not belong. An additional progression with Kurtz reading a Time
magazine to the captive Captain Willard helps to show the "normal" side of
the colonel following an insane, brutal act and it fits well.
Coppola and company have made a bigger, but not better, movie that does
have to be seen, especially on the big screen. If you extract the bloated,
additional stuff and keep the restructuring you might come up with
something that really is an improvement over the original. This version
isn't. The '79 "Apocalypse Now" gets an A and "Redux" diminishes with a B+.

 Director: Francis Ford Coppola
 Writer:  John Milius, Francis Ford Coppola, loosely based on the
novella by Joseph Conrad, "Heart of Darkness"
 Cast: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic
Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis
Hopper, G.D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford
   High school history teachers know how important it is to relate
the past to the present and, assuming that the youngsters are at
least dimly aware of current events, the teen scholars can then
relate better to times elapsed.  The same can be done with
literature.  You can associate a past event with one that took place
at a different time, thereby giving the reader a better feel for the
subject.  Something like that was tried most successfully by
Francis Ford Coppola when he used Joseph Conrad's 1902
novella "Heart of Darkness" to illuminate his epic 1979 picture
"Apocalypse Now."  Conrad's story deals with a manager of a
trading station in the Belgian Congo, a Mr. Kurtz, who goes to the
Congo with high ideals and a self-imposed mission to civilize the
natives but is instead converted by them to savagery.  Kurtz's
conversion to darkness is narrated to the reader by Marlow as an
impartial observer who makes the trip to the center of Africa which
becomes, symbolically, a journey toward the essential meaning
of life.    When the manager visits Kurtz, an admirer of the latter
tells him that Kurtz had become corrupted by the very natives he
had hoped to enlighten.  "Instead of his changing them," said the
man, "They had debased him into an atavistic savage."
   Coppola sees the story of Kurtz as a parable to explain what
happened to the Americans during the ill-advised Vietnam War
and now, with forty-nine minutes put into the film, minutes not
seen before, we become enlightened to four basic changes in the
original story which is now called "Apocalypse Now Redux."
   The many reviews that have been published and also posted
online for the original 1979 "Apocalypse Now" are easily
accessible thanks to the miracle of Internet-based, archival
storage.  There's no need here to re-invent the wheel, to repeat
what you can easily find on web sites like imdb.com,
www.mrqe.com, and rottentomatoes.com.  Suffice it to say that
Coppola's is (to be only partly facetious) a road-and-buddy movie
more than a conventional war film, featuring a group of American
vets traveling up a river on a mission to assassinate a modern
Kurtz; a colonel (played with appropriate mysticism by Marlon
Brando), with his assassin, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen),
learning quite a bit about war and life through the schizophrenic
rantings of Kurtz.  Coppola's motif is not to show that war is evil
(that's, like, duh) or that the Vietnam War was especially profane,
but that nothing stinks more than lying.  This point is driven home
most convincingly by Col. Kurtz as he reads some articles printed
in news magazines, particularly "Time," in which the president of
the United States, having sent a scout to the 'nam to find out how
the Yanks and their Vietnamese allies were doing against the Viet
Cong and the North Vietnamese troops said that things were
smelling better.  "How do they smell to you, soldier?" asks Kurtz
to his captive captain, rhetorically.  Seeing is believing.  Reading
Time magazine, listening the president...forget it.  
   Four items have been added to the movie, and what is most
refreshing about the additions is Coppola's view that the American
audience is now mature enough to absorb and delight in the
additional footage though it brings the movie up to three hours
and sixteen minutes.  (Well over three hundred hours were
actually shot in the Philippines, with digital editing partly used to
wade through all the celluloid in order to go with what best serves
the vision of the director, the writers--and the performers, who in
the particular instance of the French plantation scene did some
improvisation.)  We've been told over and over by pessimists and
elitists that movies have had to be dumbed down for the modern
viewer.  Without dismissing this charge as baseless, we can
nonetheless say that for the more sophisticated film buffs who
could enjoy a war movie that is more surreal than traditional with
periods more meditative than combative, this new version
deepens the original.
   Here are the changes...First is the plantation sequence, which
to some might appear to come from another movie. As Willard
proceeds up the river into Cambodia on his secret mission to
assassinate Kurtz, he suddenly runs into the bizarre sight of a
French plantation in the middle of the jungle, apparently unhurt by
the enemies of so-called Western imperialism.  Clean (Laurence
Fishburne) had just been buried, courtesy of the French hosts,
and during the long, wine-soaked banquet which was cooked
French-style by a Vietnamese chef and served by native
Vietnamese, the French get a chance to discuss their views of the
war with the more naive Americans.  The French, we learn from
the head of the family Hubert deMarais (Christian Marquand),
have a good reason to stay.  France is not their home: Indochina
is.  But as deMarais heatedly explains in French-accented, perfect
English, the "Americans are fighting for nothing."  The plantation
scene features an unusual seduction by the young French widow
Roxanne (Aurore Clement), making one wonder why any part of
this vista of what the poet Matthew Arnold called sweetness and
light could be omitted.
    Change two involves the Playboy playmate sequence in which
a group of playmates are choppered in to entertain the boys. This
time, Coppola puts back in an arrangement in which the
helicopter runs out of fuel and Willard trades a couple of can of
fuel for the Playmate of the Year.  The scene is metaphorical:
these beautiful women are exploited for their surface beauty in
much the way that the landscape of Vietnam is raped--and yet in
the latter case our presidents had called the action a moral one.
   Change three makes up for a time-saving cut in a sequence
featuring Marlon Brando, who expounds on greater length about
the insanity of war.  Perhaps the director originally felt that
showing too much Brando (so to speak) would take away from the
aura of mystery surrounding him: that allowing him more footage
would run the risk of humanizing him too greatly.
   The final big change adds to the jokiness of the plot, specifically
with a bunch of guys who steal the prize surfboard of their
commanding officer, Kilgore (Robert Duvall).  Putting the footage
back allows Coppola to contrast the young men, fresh into their
adventure and enjoying their kidding around, with the later horror
of death and destruction.
   It's amusing to see some of the performers as they looked
twenty-two years ago. While Martin Sheen seems to have aged
the least, Laurence Fishburne comes across a positively
adolescent (not surprising since he was only fourteen when the
filming began).  Harrison Ford is barely recognizable in his
twenties and in his brief role comes across lacking the fine lines of
character that he had developed over time.  
   Then as now, this film cannot really be compared with more
traditional war films like 'The Longest Day," "The Bridge on the
River Kwai," or "Saving Private Ryan."  "Apocalypse Now" is at
once more mystical, more reflective, more suited to a war that has
been blamed for tearing America apart.  Contrasts aside, it  ranks
as one of the most moving of its genre.
Rated R.  Running time: 196 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

It is an action flick. It is a war movie. It is an anti-war fim, a
journey into the heart of darkness, an opera of violence, a study of
masterful editing and cinematography. The Ride of Valkyrie scene alone
covers those grounds in one majestic sweep. This audience sat still in
awe and horror. I always think APOCALYPSE NOW as an elaboration of the
running themes in Francis Ford Coppola's other masterpieces, THE
GODFATHER. The myth of Michael Corleone is about the self-righteous man
whose justification for murder is loyalty to the Family. That is the Big
Cause in Corleone universe, the crusade for power. Is Coppola's morality
play a reflection of our own attitude toward the Vietnam War? To kill or
not to kill. Is the violence a sound justification to preserve
'democracy'? The soldiers in APOCALYPSE NOW certainly not out there to
preserve democracy, they are there to surf.
There is a great scene in the end where Willard kills Kurtz, and the
latter's followers bows down to welcome the newcomer to the throne. Is
Coppola saying that is how heroes are created? Michael Corleone is a
shy, sensitive character in THE GODFATHER before he guns down a rival
and a law enforcer. Not until when he kills, and in effect asserts his
masculine omnipotence, was he truly accepted in the Family and ascends
to fill the empty throne. He is a true American symbol, Coppola was
saying. Now and then, a hero is annointed, but where do heroes come
from? APOCALYPSE NOW answers that question with a brooding cynicism: Our
heroes are annointed with the blood of others.

As America reels under the agony of terrorism and Washington rattles its
saber at Afghanistan, and CNN unfurls the banner of `AMERICA'S NEW WAR' across
our television screens, it's as good a time as any to remember another war in an
inaccessible land halfway around the world.  After 22 years, Francis Ford
Coppola has finally completed his Vietnam epic, `Apocalypse Now'.  When he
introduced it at Cannes in 1979, the director described it as `a work in
progress,' and complained of critics carping at a picture that wasn't even
finished, though it was coming out in theaters.  He was 100% over budget (a
then-scandalous $31 million), more than a year over schedule, battered in mind,
body, and spirit from massive production disasters of God's making and his own,
and under intense pressure to deliver a movie that would not tax the attention
span of its audience.  Sounding a little unhinged by the strain, he declared at
a press conference `This picture isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam.'
Now, working with his original editor Walter Murch from the original
dailies, he has remixed and re-edited, and restored some 49 minutes from the
cutting room floor.  He calls this revisited version `Apocalypse Now Redux'.  
Now that it's finally ready for the critics, how is it?  It's extraordinary. 
Coppola, who's now in the wine business, has learned a little something about
letting things age and ripen.  At 2 ˝  hours the original release was hardly
rushed, but the restored footage expands and enlightens the director's Dantesque
vision of a world gone mad with war.
The story, briefly, is a Vietnam adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novella
Heart of Darkness.  Marlow becomes Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a Special
Forces assassin who is given a mission to go up river, locate a rogue American
colonel named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), and `terminate him with extreme prejudice.'
 As he studies Kurtz's brilliant résumé, and as he draws closer to his quarry,
Willard comes to understand and even admire the man, and becomes increasingly
aware that the darkness is not just in the mad Kurtz, but in the system, in the
war, and in himself.  
The war in `Apocalypse' is a war without a real enemy presence.  It is not
filled with  pitched battles against enemy troops.  The primary thrust is the
American Willard on a mission to destroy the American Kurtz, with a few almost
incidental skirmishes en route, most of them involving civilians.  It is, in
effect, a war with ourselves.
The biggest chunk of restored footage is a scene at a French plantation,
where Willard puts in to bury a slain crewman (Larry Fishburne), and stays for
dinner and a bit of romance amid the ruined elegance of a lost colonial world
unmoored from reality.  Cut originally because it was thought to distract from
the upriver momentum of Willard's quest, it now opens a ghostly window onto the
experience of the French in Vietnam, a cause already lost but not yet learned
from.  `You Americans,' says the French planter (Christian Marquand), `you are
fighting for the biggest nothing in history.'  
Another resurrected scene has Willard bargaining fuel for sexual favors for
his men from a stranded USO troupe of Playboy bunnies.  This scene doesn't work
as well as it should, and smacks of pandering, but it has a point to make about
exploitation.  The rest of the additions serve to deepen the sense of place and
character.
The intervening years have given `Redux' a deeper resonance.  Many of the
lines of dialogue and narration vibrate like lost chords.  Those young actors
have grown older, but in the movie they're like soldiers thawed from memory on
the battlefield.  Martin Sheen was a down-the-ladder choice for the role of
Willard.  Coppola had wanted Pacino, Caan, Nicholson, even Clint Eastwood.  He'd
hired Harvey Keitel, then fired him, and settled at last on Sheen.  Looking at
it now it is apparent, as it was not to me then, that Sheen mustered a
heroically intense performance that is both wild-eyed and understated, nearly
killing himself with a heart attack in the process.  That he survived and is
now, in our hearts and television sets, the President of the United States,
gives that youthful military assassin an extra dimension.
Robert Duvall's celebrated Col. Kilgore is as vivid as ever, swaggering
through smoke and bullets, destroying a village to make a beach safe for
surfing, and relishing `the smell of napalm in the morning.'  But added moments
showing Kilgore compassionately helping wounded Vietnamese children, only to
drop them without a thought when the surf comes up, give a new insight to his
character, and ours.  Duvall has said in interviews he feels the added footage
shows that Kilgore is more than just a madman, but Coppola seems to me to be
making a different point  that we Americans enjoy our moment of compassion, but
we're easily distracted.  
Brando, who demanded and got the obscene sum of one million dollars (a
figure now tinny with irony, like Dr. Evil's world ransom) for playing Kurtz,
shocked the filmmakers and the public in '79 with his corpulence.  Coppola
swathed him in heavy shadows to conceal it, but with  today's huge Brando for a
point of reference, the man looks trim.  Anyway, why shouldn't Kurtz have been
fat?  He was living deep in the jungle, without a military regimen, deified by
Montagnard tribesmen who catered to his every whim.  Like Brando's in Tahiti,
Kurtz's situation is conducive to weight gain.  Brando is said to have toyed
with his young director, improvising dialogue, playing mind games, and behaving
arrogantly.  Whatever hell he put Coppola through, it works  Brando's
megalomania infuses Kurtz with a freakish truth that a disciplined, scripted
performance might not have accomplished. 
They don't make movies like this any more.  One has only to compare this
summer's big war movie, `Pearl Harbor', to see what accountancy and digital
gimcrackery have wrought on the genre.  Of course, they didn't make movies like
this back then, either  or perhaps only then, in that brief blaze of youthful
talent fueled with funds that seemed limitless, that produced `The Deer Hunter'
and `Apocalypse Now' and a few other works of impassioned, lunatic genius.  `The
way we made it was very much like the way the Americans were in Vietnam,'
Coppola said then.  `We were in the jungle, we had access to too much money and
too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.'
And now, we're back at war again.  As Kurtz observes, `the horror.'

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Screenplay by John Milius and Coppola,
based on the novel "Heart Of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad, with narration 
by Michael Herr. Starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall. 
Running time: 202 minutes. Rated R for offensive language throughout by 
the MFCB. Reviewed on October 8th, 2001.
Synopsis: In the midst of the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Sheen) is 
ordered to travel upriver into Cambodia in search of Colonel Walter Kurtz 
(Brando), who went AWOL and fled into the jungle. En route, Willard is 
witness to many of the horrors the war has wrought upon the countryside, 
and upon the men and women brought in to wage it.
Review: Few movies are so shattering as "Apocalypse Now". It tells of a
journey up a river, but in reality it is a journey into the very heart of 
madness. Each stop is more evidence of this: a colonel obsessed with 
surfing, an attack on the boat not with gunfire but with arrows and 
spears, a final American outpost manned by soldiers long since descended 
into insanity. And it all ends with Kurtz, raising a kingdom of the mad in 
the midst of the jungle, who does not just recognise the insanity of war, 
is not just a victim of it, but who thrives upon it. Sheen and Brando are 
outstanding. One plays a steely professional, the other a philosophical 
monomaniac, but both are crazy in their own way. "Apocalypse Now Redux" 
extends the lengthy film by about forty minutes, if anything accentuating 
the dreamlike atmosphere of the narrative. Some new scenes work, like a 
delirious second encounter with the Playboy bunnies and extra commentary 
by Kurtz. But the longest new segment, set at a French plantation house, 
jars us out of the rhythm of the story; even the hypnotic incidental music 
becomes trite and inappropriate. When I first saw "Apocalypse Now", I was 
unsure whether I truly liked it, but my appreciation for Coppola's triumph 
has only increased in the intervening years. "Redux" is not a stronger 
film, but it is a no less effective and mesmerising cinematic experience.

In 1979, Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was the hit of the Cannes
Film Festival, winning the Palm D'Or.  (It lost the Oscar, however, to
"Kramer vs. Kramer" for that year.)  In 2001, with 49 minutes of footage
restored (including the much talked about French plantation sequence) and
its time line slightly rejiggered, the newly reedited "Apocalypse Now Redux" 
was the hit of the Cannes Film Festival again.
Is the new version better?  No, I don't think so.  The French plantation
sequence tries to give some historical perspective, but it's dialogue is
clunky, particularly between Willard and Roxanne (Aurore Clement).  Coppola
had great instincts for what he wanted his score to sound like, but the newly
done piece for these scenes sounds like sappy synth. It does feature a lovely 
piece where Clean (a fourteen year old Laurence Fishburne) is buried, that 
further fleshes out Chief's (Albert Hall) character, but Coppola and his 
editor Walter Murch's instincts were right on this bit the first time.
In fact, "Redux" has the overall result of making us know all of Chief's
men - Sam Bottoms' surfer Lance, Fishburne's Clean and most of all, Frederic
Forrest's Chef - much better, while making Willard more of a blank slate.
Willard's at odds with himself in "Redux."  He has no time to delay his
mission when Chief wants to seach a boat or subsequently take a wounded
civilian for medical care, yet he'd trade two precious barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with some Playboy bunnies?  Speaking of the bunnies,
their restored extra scene at a hellish medevac camp feels exactly like a 
DVD outtake thrown into the cut.  The concept of men operating without a CO 
is explored far more convincingly at the last American outpost where 
Willard asks a crazed soldier who his commanding officer is and is asked
in return 'Aren't you?'
Still, seeing "Apocalypse" in any form again on the big screen in a new
Technicolor print is a treat, although the print I saw suffered from more
blips and scratches than I would have expected.  We can appreciate that Robert 
Duvall's cracked Colonel Kilgore is one of the great film characters ever
to march across the big screen.  Extra footage is mostly welcome with his
character, although Kilgore's loudspeaker demands for the return of his 
surfboard, stolen by Willard's gang, carry the joke too far.  Brando gets his 
Time magazine reading added, showing a more rational Kurtz than any original 
scene ever did.  
Mostly what "Apocalypse Now Redux" points out is how much Coppola was indebted
to his editor (Murch began with 1.25 million feet of film!) and brilliant
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.  "Apocalypse Now" packs every bit as much
punch now as it did in 1979 and we can thank "Redux" for reminding us.

When Orson Welles first hit Hollywood, his initial impulse was to turn
Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness into a feature film. He couldn't secure
financing for it and made Citizen Kane instead. 30 years later, Francis Ford
Coppola tried his hand at Darkness, but, like Welles, had money troubles and
ended up adapting The Godfather.  Citizen Kane and The Godfather are widely
considered to be the two greatest films ever made, so following that logic,
all young, aspiring filmmakers should take a crack at Conrad's novella.
Coppola, of course, eventually did make his own version of Darkness, but it
wasn't until amassing a small fortune from the first two Godfather films and
The Conversation.  The '70s were a pretty decent time for ol' Francis,
bookending the decade with a screenwriting Oscar for Patton in 1970 and
eight nominations for 1979's Apocalypse Now (it won for sound and
cinematography but pretty much lost everything else to Kramer vs. Kramer).
22 years later, Now is back in theatres as Apocalypse Now Redux, into which
editor Walter Murch (the restored Touch of Evil) has massaged about 50
minutes of new material (increasing the running time to well over three
hours).  From the opening strains of The Doors' "The End," to the bright
orange napalm explosions, to the ceiling fan that sounds like a helicopter
in the Saigon hotel room of Captain Benjamin L. Willard, it takes about two
minutes to confirm that the restored sound and picture (originally lensed by
Goya in Bordeaux's Vittorio Storaro) were a worthwhile investment.
Willard (Martin Sheen, The West Wing), a recently divorced soldier on his
second tour of Vietnam, is waiting for an assignment to take him back into
The Shit.  But we quickly see Willard has some serious demons, plus a bit of
a paranoid streak, when two MPs arrive to take him to see the General.  He
thinks he's about to be charged with something, but instead, the General
sends him on a unique mission.
It turns out that there is a rogue soldier named Kurtz (Marlon Brando, The
Score) who has worked his way up a winding river into Cambodia and,
somewhere along the way, lost his mind.  Willard's assignment is to take a
PT boat up the river, find Kurtz and "terminate with extreme prejudice."
Willard has concerns.  After all, he's killed plenty of people, but never
another American; never a fellow soldier.  A tall, thin Harrison Ford is in
this scene, and this was way back when he used to try to act, so that's kind
of fun, too.
Willard and his crew - the gruff boat pilot Chief (Albert Hall),
professional surfer Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms), New Orleans saucier Chef
(Frederic Forrest), and 17-year-old Mr. Clean (played by then 14-year-old
Laurence Fishburne) - set off on a crazy journey that involves, among other
things, surfing, Wagner-blaring helicopters, Playboy Bunnies, waterskiing,
and a hungry tiger.  Coppola nails the surrealism of the war, as well as
showing our society's need to eliminate those who don't fit in.  Kurtz was
an exemplary soldier with unusual but effective methods.  In other words, he
didn't kill in the proper way, becoming dangerous to the greater War cause.
Willard's journey is more like The Odyssey than O Brother, Where Art Thou?
was.  It's all there - the Bunnies are the sirens, and Robert Duvall's
Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore may as well have been wearing an eye patch.
The further upriver Willard goes, the crazier things become, leaving him to
wonder what he'll find at the end.  Think about it - if Kilgore isn't
considered insane, how far gone must Kurtz be?
There are four major additions to Now, some of which are shown (in part) in
Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, a unsettling documentary
filmed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor.  The first shows Willard bonding with his
crew early in the film, just after the Kilgore incident.  There's a new
scene where Willard trades fuel for two hours with the Bunnies, which are
just one more thing for the American soldier to exploit in Coppola's Man vs.
Nature tale.  The third is a lengthy diversion where Willard stumbles onto a
French plantation that seems totally unaffected by the War, helping give Now
the effect of going backwards in time as the boat goes upriver.  And there's
some additional footage of Kurtz and Willard that, allegedly, helps to
clarify the ending for those of you who didn't get it the first time around.
Are the additions necessary?  Probably not to us, but they were to Coppola,
who originally scrambled to get Now ready for Cannes (it won the Golden
Palm).  If anything, it's an excuse to see the film on the big screen, and
that's good enough for me.
3:17 - R for disturbing violent images, language, sexual content and some
drug use

     Far much more than just another war movie, Francis Ford Coppola's
stunning reworking of Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS is one of the
ultimate cinematic experiences.  Boldly transferring the story from
1930s' Africa to late 1960s' Vietnam, Coppola give us a bizarre and
hallucinatory vision of the madness of war.
     There are stunning visuals, from the opening technicolour
explosions to the final climax at a ritual sacrifice.  Sound is also
used to full effect, as we hear the throbbing of the helicopters
filling the Dolby Surround soundtrack.  Coppola makes what some would
consider an unusual choice by using The Doors' "The End" to bookend the
film, but it works so well you may be surprised to find it wasn't
written for the scenes.
     Martin Sheen gives a complex performance as Lieutenant Willard,
which dominates the film until the final half hour when Marlon Brando's
intense, sometimes incoherent Colonel Kurtz takes over the picture and
leads it in an entirely different direction.  Although some critics
have blasted the bloated Brando's portrayal of the monster that is
Kurtz, this could be the actor's last great role.
     Packed with memorable moments, such a helicopter blade blurring
into an overhead fan in a cloud of marijuana smoke, this is a film you
will want to see again and again.  Despite not being to every one's
taste, Apocalypse Now should stand as a testament to the skill of the
director and the leading players.

APOCALYPSE NOW, based on the novel "Hearts of Darkness", is an
extremely striking, gripping, and horrifying depiction of the Vietnam War
from another angle.  A long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is
actually an anti-war film.  In many ways, this debate could go either way.
APOCALYPSE NOW is probably one of the most memorable Vietnam War films
ever made.  In addition, now film has gone to the extremes that this film
does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the
most devastating war of recent years.
APOCALYPSE NOW follows the mission Captain Benjamin L. Willard, played by
Martin Sheen, to seek out and eliminate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a Green
Beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base
in Cambodia.  Captain Willard is ordered to assassinate Kurtz with
"extreme prejudice" because he has been deemed a murderer.  Willard
accepts his mission, but not while pondering the accusation.  Accusing
someone of murder in this situation is like "handing out speeding tickets
at the Indy 500", as he puts it.  It doesn't make too much sense.
Escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat.
The men are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), Lance Johnson
(Sam Bottoms) and Mr. Clean (a fifteen year-old Laurence Fishburne).
Willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is, but
they all know it is something big.  The men encounter many exciting,
dangerous and bizarre situations.  But no situation is more bizarre than
the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric Robert Duvall as
Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore.  Kilgore decides to attack and overtake a 
certain beach area so that his men can surf.  Surf.  This is all inspired
when Kilgore is able to meet the famed California surfer Lance Johnson.
Duvall's portrayal as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore is terrific, and, he
provides a number of memorable quotes.
Eventually, Captain Willard encounters Colonel Kurtz's frightening
community full of strange things everywhere you look, especially his
followers.  One of his main followers is a freelance photographer (Dennis
Hopper) who attempts to convey the situations to Willard.  But Willard
cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony.  Kurtz is
actually well aware of Willard's mission, and refers to him as "an errand
boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill".  Yet Willard is intent on
completing his mission, no matter what shocking things Kurtz does.
APOCALYPSE NOW, possibly one of the greatest films ever made, is a
stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the Vietnam War.  A
movie that will hypnotize you with it's brilliant cinematography,
APOCALYPSE NOW is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial 
and horrifying ravages of war.  Definitely on the "do not miss" list.  Be
prepared for a very memorable film.

APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com
 Forget The Godfather.  The sheer brilliance of Francis Ford Coppola
lies in the images and words of his real masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. 
Twenty-two years ago, Coppola ventured into the jungles of the
Philippines to shoot an adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,
set against the turmoil and fury of the Vietnam War.  Coppola assembled
an impressive cast of actors -- 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne, Robert
Duvall, Martin Sheen (replacing Harvey Keitel), Dennis Hopper, Frederic
Forrest, and the great Marlon Brando -- and set out to shoot a war
epic.  By the end, Coppola had lost 100 pounds, principal photography
ran for 16 weeks, Martin Sheen had a heart attack, Brando demanded all
of his shots be done in shadow, and Coppola had invested millions of his
own money to keep the production going, all while threatening suicide
numerous times.  After all the pain, Apocalypse Now was finally
revealed, exposing itself as one of the most amazing pieces of celluloid
ever produced, capturing not only the ugliness and ridiculousness of
Vietnam, but exposing the dark heart of man as well.
The end result: 8 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture) and
2 wins for Cinematography and Score.  Apocalypse Now additionally
cemented Coppola's place as an A-plus-list film director, giving him
free rein for the next 20 years to make crap like Captain Eo and Jack,
junk which no one in Hollywood would dare criticize.
Like Cameron (with The Abyss) and Lucas (with Star Wars), Coppola
recently decided to take another whack at Apocalypse Now, dubbing this
new director's cut Apocalypse Now Redux.  At a running time of over 3
hours and 15 minutes, Redux demands even more of your attention (the
original runs 2:33) and still it never lets you up for a breath of
reality. 
Apocalypse Now follows the story of a burnt out Army captain named
Willard (Sheen), who has been given the task of hunting down and
"exterminating... with extreme prejudice" a renegade Green Beret colonel
named Kurtz (Brando).  Kurtz has apparently gone insane, establishing
himself as a God for a Cambodian jungle tribe.  Willard travels upriver
on a Navy PBR with four grunts: Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert
Hall), Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne), and Lance (Sam Bottoms, who was
on speed and LSD for most of the film's production).  Along the way,
Willard and his crew encounter the mighty Captain Kilgore (Robert
Duvall), pass the time waterskiing and shooting locals, and spend a
strange dinner conversing with French colonists still fighting the Viet
Cong.  In the end, Dante's Inferno is reached when the boat finds a
coked-up photographer (played by Dennis Hopper) and Colonel Kurtz
himself.
Apocalypse Now is not a film but a sensory overload for the insane.  The
Redux version adds over 40 minutes of original footage (not digitally
enhanced crap) which further details and defines the horrors encountered
by Willard on his travel up the river to find Kurtz.  Four main scenes
are restored: a scene where Willard and his crew encounter the Playboy
Playmates stranded upriver, the bizarre French Plantation dinner scene
mentioned above, a key scene between Kurtz and Willard which further
explores Kurtz's psyche, and additional bits on the boat near the
beginning of the journey, better establishing the camaraderie onboard.
Does Apocalypse Now need a new, longer cut?  No.  Is the original
inexplicably improved with one?  Somehow, yes.  Highly recommended.
Director: Francis Coppola
Producer: Francis Coppola
Writer: Francis Coppola, John Milius
Starring: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest,
Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper

    It is with hesitance that I call "Apocalypse Now" a masterpiece.  
Certainly, it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever 
made, with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease, and 
some of the finest actors of the 1970's.  The plot, an adaptation of 
Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", was set in Vietnam, and the timing 
of the film was supposed to be brilliant, coming on the heels of the end 
of the war.
"Apocalypse" certainly has its moments, some of which are the finest 
in film history.  The plot is fairly simple.  Captain Willard (Sheen), 
is a troubled soldier who came back to Hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty.  
His mission is simple: take a boat up to Cambodian territory, and 
destroy the command of renegade Colonel Kurtz (Brando) "with extreme 
prejudice".  Along the way, Willard runs into a series of adventures, 
including one with Lt. Col. Kilgore (Duvall), and a strange encounter 
with Playboy bunnies.  Willard' s four person crew finally make it to 
Kurtz' compound, where he discovers Kurtz has set himself up as a god 
among the natives.  Willard's experiences with Kurtz take up the last 
half-hour, with a confrontation and eventual ending.
The movie is visually breathtaking.  The battle scenes are 
exquisitely done, and the score is brilliant, setting a murky mood of 
darkness that is first-rate.  The collage of disturbing images that 
Coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening.  The vast 
amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning, and there are 
many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire 
movie.  The journey to Kurtz' camp is quite a ride, with psychosis 
setting in on almost every character.  The most interesting one is 
Kilgore, the Lt. Col. who cares more about the surf than about the 
mission.  It is at times revolting, psychotic, and incredible, and it is 
one hell of a movie.  The scenes are bold, inventive, and powerful, and 
the acting is stunning, especially be Sheen, Duvall, and Fishburne.  The 
narration is exquisite, as is the mystery of Kurtz.  Coppola sets about 
a hallucinatory ride through Vietnam, kind of like "Saving Private Ryan" 
on LSD.  The film is jarring in its implications, and psychotic in its 
execution.
The problems come when the film slows down.  One of the major scenes 
in the film, where the boat arrives at the final Army checkpoint before 
they start their search for Kurtz, is a colossal mess.  The dialogue is 
confusing, the lighting is atrocious, and the scene drags on for 10 
terrible minutes of film.  The true problems happen after the crew does 
come into the Kurtz compound.  The film slows down to a drag.  Sheen 
seems forever captured by a madman, played by Brando is a lazy 
performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received.  Brando 
is in the film for no more than 15 minutes, but is bathed in shadows the 
entire time, making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic.  
The scenes are poorly done, the dialogue is muffled, and the whole mess 
is utterly confusing beyond all belief.  Sheen seems to adore this man, 
but why the viewers are never told.  The entire journey is supposed to 
be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like Kurtz, but the 
scenes fall way short of expectations.  Granted, it has its moments, 
which are brutally horrific, but the general feeling is one of 
confusion.  Brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir, and my 
feeling was that this could never be a great man, this could never be a 
man who inspires hundreds to follow him, so why do they do it?  There 
are moments of brilliance, but the visual confusion dilutes the power of 
the scene.  There are too many questions left unanswered with the 
character of Kurtz to have a satisfying ending.
The finest scene at the end is Sheen's escape, and his entrace into 
the temple.  His rise out of the water, with the smoke coming off of his 
slicked head, is a brilliant 30 seconds of film.  Yet, you cannot shake 
the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done.  The 
psychotic ride is unforgettable at times, and indeed the film on the 
whole is very good.  It is a stunningly flawed expression of film, for 
it addresses major issues, such as man's mental stamina during bouts of 
war.  But one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have 
so much more powerful, had the character of Kurtz been more explored, 
and had Sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was 
destined for.  There is too much good material in here not to be called 
a masterpiece, but it could have been so much more rewarding.
