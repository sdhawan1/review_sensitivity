In Cujo there was one bat, and a handful of people died. Now imagine there
are thousands of bats. Net result? Even more people die. But now of course
the bats are digital, and--in close-up--bear some serious family resemblance
to the little 'demons' in The Gate. Which is part of the fun: horror is far
and away the most self-referential of the genres. It has to be. If it
doesn't conscientiously acknowledge its precursors, we assume that it's
presuming to exist in a vacuum, to be not derivative in spite of a horror
section that sprawls over half the video store. It's about respect, and Bats
dutifully shows it, even going so far as to place Nosferatu on the marquee
and work it into the background over and over.
As for the story, it's comfortably familiar: Mad Scientist being punished
for hubris, for tampering with nature, for doing to some bats what the
scientists in Deep Blue Sea did to their sharks--making them into killing
machines, then 'accidentally' releasing them. Next of course you have to
assemble the crew, gather all the specialists (Lake Placid, etc), see how
they function together, all that. And of course a staple of all this is that
the Mad Scientist doesn't want his creation killed, in spite of the fact
that it so obviously needs to be killed. None of this is new. Neither is the
role of Sheriff Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), the token authority figure
who quickly becomes central to everything. Ben Affleck in Phantoms, Roy
Scheider in Jaws, the list goes on.
More or less, Bats is an airborne Arachnophobia, even down to the 'Typhoid
Mary' spider/bat, who has to die in a final grudge match in order for the
bats/spiders to be 'really' beaten. Or, looking at it from the
vampire-angle,
the head vampire has to die, be it at the hands of Corey Haim and Co. or
Sheriff Kimsey and his ragtag crew: bat-guru Sheila Caspar (Dina Meyer; and
yes, 'Caspar,' this close to Halloween) and her comical side-kick Jimmy
(Leon), who single-handedly provides half the fun of Bats.
The other half is of course the bats (Chiroptera) themselves, that
Gremlin-like supply of bats. The same bats who are both driven to kill by
hunger and rarely bother to stop and eat any of their victims. But so be it.
Those victims do tend to die fairly graphically, and that's what we really
want, after all. So far, all of this meets the admittedly low criterions
Bats sets for itself. But then it goes a little far, (guilty of hubris
itself, yes) tries to draw from one source too many: Outbreak. Yes, the
'virus' these bats are carrying will soon paint most of a computer
simulation of North America red. Meaning Kimsey and Co. aren't just trying
to save their small corner of the world (from the bats and the military),
but the world itself. Which does a lot to defeat the isolation which is so
vital to horror. They even have radio and modem uplinks to the outside
world, and thus are able to order supplies, when what would work better is
to see them defeat the bats all by themselves. That's the kind of stuff that
reinforces our sense of self-worth, as if we might have done the same thing,
given the same circumstances. Still, however, and in spite of all the
outside help, properly killing all these bats isn't quite a cakewalk,
although we know all along it's more or less an inevitability. The question
is just how, and, even if Bats doesn't hide that quite as well as, say,
Mimic does, it still manages to satisfy. It is the season for bats, after
all. We can forgive the small things, so long as the none of the conventions
are ignored. Bats, comprehensively derivative as it is, ignores not a single
one.

Bats isn't exactly a bad horror film if you approach it with the attitude
that you aren't about to see anything that you probably haven't already seen
a hundred times in other horror films. It has the usual predictable plot and
dialogue, along with the usual population of stupid horror film characters.
About the only real scary part of this movie is the direction. How Louis
Morneau ever got a job directing a film, even a b-grade one like this, is
completely beyond my scope of comprehension. At first, the direction was
what I would generously call interesting, but it rapidly deteriorated into
something worthy of the result that you would get if you gave a monkey on
speed a handycam and set him loose. Every time there was some sort of
dramatic bat attack -- which was fairly frequent if you haven't already
gleaned that from the title -- the camera wold go off on some sort of hyped
up whirlwind trip of herky jerky motion. Now the more forgiving in the
audience may have attributed this fact to trying to cut down on the gore.
Maybe it could even be called a compensation for poor special effects, but I
tend to think it was just a director who didn't have a clue what the hell he
was doing.
As for the story, it revolves around a small Texas town that is having a
little bat problem. Apparently, genetically enhanced flying foxes have
escaped from a nearby research lab and have infected the entire bat
population in the area. We never quite get an explanation how the other bats
are infected or how this infection seems to increase them to double their
original size. But you really didn't expect a horror film to make perfect
sense did you? It comes down to the beautiful bat expert (Dina Meyer), who
teams up with the local sheriff, (Lou Diamond Phillips) to try to rid the
town of its bat problem. And just to add to the tension -- as if the cheesy
dialogue and plot weren't enough -- they have only a limited time to stop
the bats before the military intervenes by bombing the whole area to kingdom
come to stop the spread of the nasty winged creatures.
The dialogue in the movie goes something like this. Phillips and Meyer are
lifting some crates. She tells him to lift with his legs. He remarks that if
his legs looked as good as hers that he would use them more often. While I
can't disagree with the sentiment, I have to wonder if some horny junior
high student wasn't responsible for some of these winning lines.
Meyer and Phillips are actually two pretty good actors. The problem for each
of them has always seemed to be poor career decisions. Phillips has proven
his talent in films like Courage Under Fire. Meyer is best known for her
work in Starship Troopers, where she was undoubtedly cast as much for her
willingness to go topless as anything else. I have no doubt that Meyer,
given the right role, would hold up admirably -- this isn't that role. The
dialogue and situations aren't quite bad enough as to be embarrassing for
the actors, but they come pretty damn close. I'm still trying to figure out
why the army was going to blow up half of Texas. I'm sure it was explained,
but I was too busy checking out Meyer's ass -- by far the best part of the
movie. I'm not even going to get into the holes in the plot wide enough to
drive a convoy through, or the music that sounded like it was being played
by a drunk using a broken keyboard. Let's just suffice to say that the
cleverest part of this movie was the poster.
Do yourself a favor. Wait for this one to come out on video. Better yet,
save yourself a couple of bucks and wait for it to show up on cable.

Directed by Louis Morneau.
Cast: Lou Diamond Phillips, Dina Meyer, Leon, Bob Gunton, Carlos Jacott.
1999 - 90 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for profanity and mild gore).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, October 22, 1999.
If you thought last summer's "Lake Placid," one of the most recent 
"nature-run-amok" horror flicks, was unsatisfying, wait until you get a load 
of "Bats," a PG-13-rated snoozefest that is just about as mild and unscary as 
a film can be in this genre. The premiere picture for new movie studio, 
Destination Films, it is obvious that they timed the release perfectly so as 
to cash in on the impending holiday, but in their mad rush to get it finished 
and out in theaters, they have forgotten a few vital elements, such as 
likable characters that you can root for, hair-raising chills, and a story 
that actually makes sense. Halloween may bring it in some fast cash at the 
box-office, but "Bats" is strictly direct-to-video fare, and it certainly 
doesn't bode well for Destination, which is off to a disasterous start.
The pre-credits sequence features a teenage couple parked out in the middle 
of a desolate desert road. The guy thinks he feels something swipe by his 
arm, which was hanging out the window, so he goes to check it out. Then, BAM! 
You know the routine, and this tried-and-true horror cliche can often be fun. 
Unfortunately, because of the PG-13 rating they must adhere to, the attack 
scene is a collage of quick, flashy cuts, which are rather difficult to make 
out. Even on the most elementary level, "Bats" fails miserably.
Switch to young bat researcher (now there's a career!) Sheila Casper (Dina 
Meyer) and her wise-cracking assistant (Leon), who are approached to travel 
to Gallup, Arizona, to investigate a series of murders believed to be caused 
by bats. This is impossible, Sheila skepticizes, because bats aren't 
carnivorous. That's, of course, before Sheila, along with the town sheriff, 
Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), discover mad scientist Dr. McCabe (Bob 
Gunton) has created two biologically-altered bats who have the ability to 
pass on a virus throughout their species, rendering them deadly. Soon, the 
small desert town is being overrun by the black-winged serpents, and it is up 
to our three zero-dimensional heroes to stop them.
If I had known that the film was going to be so depressingly bad, and that 
the word, 'bats,' was going to be uttered to the point of nausea, I would 
have kept myself busy by counting the exact number of times it is spoken. In 
all seriousness, the word, 'bats,' is mentioned in at least fifty percent of 
the lines of dialogue, clearly out of desperation to keep the film 
interesting when it's actually extremely dull. No attempt is made in the 
vacuous screenplay, by John Logan, to develop the characters or the 
relationships, and the plot itself furiously comes into focus in the first 
ten minutes, and is never brought up again. In place of intelligence, we get 
scene after scene of extras running around screaming, a 'la Hitchcock's "The 
Birds," but without any of the excitement. And once that ends, a prolonged, 
insipid climax comes into play, set in the pure daylight!
With visual effects that are adequately convincing, bats that are about as 
believable as the Muppets, and three performers (Phillips, Meyer, and Leon) 
who are unquestionably above this grade-Z material, the most annoying thing 
about "Bats" is its out-and-out earnestness. With a premise as ridiculous as 
this one, at least a little bit of self-knowing jokiness is needed to show 
viewers that, yes, the filmmakers know it's silly. Ultimately, the only 
comedy present is in Leon's lame-o one-liners, and that earnestness--it just 
never lets up! Had the tone of "Bats" been along the lines of 1995's 
intentionally campy, "Tales From the Crypt Presents Demon Knight," director 
Louis Morneau, in an inauspicious jump to the big leagues after his work on 
the surprisingly superior "Carnosaur 2," might have been onto something. As 
is, "Bats" is low-rent horror garbage, and one of those rare theatrical 
outings that actually deserves to be relegated to the junk bin at video 
stores across the world.

In Louis Morneau's BATS, these unnecessarily maligned creatures are
noshing on the residents of Gallop, Texas -- not that you'll care.  A
direct rip-off of THE BIRDS, although without any of its suspense and
with no improvements in the special effects over Hitchcock's 1963
classic, this cheap-looking movie never rises above the level of a
popcorn flick.  Check your brain at the door, order lots of snacks from
the concession stand and eat slowly.  You won't exactly be entertained,
but you'll probably stay awake as you munch away.
So which actors set off your casting red flags?  For me they include Lou
Diamond Phillips and Burt Reynolds, although both, admittedly, have --
on rare occasions -- done some nice acting.  This movie stars Lou
Diamond Phillips as Emmett Kimsey, the sheriff of the unlucky Texas
town.  (The cast, thankfully, doesn't include Reynolds.)  Kimsey will do
and say more dumb things that you can count.
The problem with the direction and with John Logan's script is that both
treat the laughably bad material with dead seriousness.  Only as a
parody does the show have a chance.  Phillips costars with Dina Meyer as
bat expert Dr. Sheila Casper.  No matter how ludicrous the story gets,
Meyer acts like she thinks she's making a public health documentary
about some genuine threat.
(A self-styled "Bat Lady" came recently to my son's scout meeting in
order to show us real bats, most of whose bite can't even break your
skin, and to dispel their undeserved nefarious reputation.  Bats, which
she spends her entire life rescuing, are a natural and necessary
predator for insects and are absolutely no threat to man except when
rabid.  And when rabid, they are too sick to fly, so about the only way
to get hurt is to stick your finger next to them as they lie helpless.)
"Bats don't kill people.  Period," Sheila informs the sheriff.  "So
there must be some other explanation."
Yes, there is, and it's the standard cliché of a secret government
project run by an evil scientist, Dr. Alexander McCabe (Bob Gunton),
who'll try to thwart the killer bats' destruction.
Sheila's black assistant, Jimmy Sands (León), in a heavily stereotyped
role, at least tries -- without any success -- to elicit a few much
needed laughs.  A man who makes his living studying bats, Jimmy doesn't
think much of them.  "I like 'em, but at a distance, a real distance
like on 'Wild Kingdom,'" he explains to his boss Sheila.
Among Jimmy's other lines in the unoriginal script are: "Houston, we've
got a problem," and "I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't
want anyone moving up the food chain.  Period."  (People say "Period" a
lot in this film.  It's the writer's pedantic way of reminding you of
the supposed importance of the sentence.)
The movie falls back on every tired horror movie cliché.  Take Lover's
Lane.  When you were a teenager, you might have had some fun and
memorable times there.  But in horror movies, nothing good ever happens
to kids who visit one.  And in this movie nothing good ever happens for
the audience.  Enjoy that popcorn.  It'll be the best part of the
experience of watching BATS.
BATS runs 1:30.  It is incorrectly rated PG-13 for intense sequences of
bat attacks and brief language.  Having bloody corpses with guts
everywhere and showing ferocious attacks, the movie clearly should have
been rated R by the MPAA, not PG-13.  The film would be acceptable for
those teenagers who aren't prone to nightmares, but the movie is
inappropriate for anyone less than 13.

As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't shut up often.  But, when the
lights go down, my mouth clamps shut... Unless its a complete Z-grade movie
like Bats.
Bats is one of those movies where you have to get popcorn just to throw it at
the screen.  It is one of those movies where you have to make fun of those
little kids scared out of their wits three rows behind you on the other side
of the theatre.  Most of all, however, it is one of those movies where you
have to provide a running commentary.
My theory on this is that, as the mind sees such a bad product, it begins to
make some sense of it by turning it into a comedy.  After all, any movie where
I can emerge from the theatre saying "once again, man has made the world safe
from small mammals" might just provide Post Traumatic Stress Disorder without
a bit of sardonic humor implanted into it.
The plot of Bats is so very old that I had to wonder if the movie was
vaulted.  Vaulted is the industry term for a movie that was deemed unfit for
release when it was made but is getting released now because a star or
director of it had recent popularity.
Bats centers around two virus-infected carnivorous bats that were genetically
altered by a mad scientist and are now infecting a good portion of the bat
population around Gallup, Texas.  Every night, they come out of their cave and
attempt to eat everything in sight.  Of course, even though they're supposed
to be omnivorous, they skip right by the all-you-can-eat-buffet of grass and
go straight for the Grade-A meat known as a fat Texan hick.
To stop these bats, Shelia Casper (Dina Meyer) and her assistant Jimmy
(rapper Leon) team up with straw-chewing sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond
Phillips).  What follows is an hour and a half of your best one-liners,
insulting a movie that begs for it.
For a vague approximation of how bad the movie actually is, think back to all
of those schlock horror films of the 1980s.  You know the ones I'm talking
about... the films that made people stop making horror films (and then Kevin
Williamson came along with Scream).
Better yet, think to any episode you might have watched of Mystery Science
Theatre 3000, the show where three individuals are forced to watch the worst
movies in history and end up cracking jokes on them.  When you think in this
frame of mind, it's easy to figure out what it will be like watching the film.
 You will find that you have inside of you more great one-line insults then
you ever imagined!  Your creativity will be honed!
For this reason, I say that Bats is a fine film to see with a group of
friends.  Go ahead and watch it, but don't expect thrills.  Don't expect
chills.  Expect laughs... at what comes out of your best friend's mouth.

"...because I'm a scientist.  That's what we do!"
    --- Dr. Alexander McCabe (Bob Gunton), in response to why he created
evil bats.
Alright folks, stop me if you've heard this one: genetically altered
animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals, assisted by
a specialist in the particular animal's field, must team up to stop
the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the
earth.  Oh yeah, the military is on their way to bomb the town as
well, so they are running short on time.  Sound familiar?  Such is the
plot of the Destination Films release of Bats.
Dina Meyer stars as the "bat specialist" Sheila, who is pulled from
her research (along with her annoying sidekick, played with irritating
deftness by Leon) in order to help a small Texas town figure out why
some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently.
With the help of the local sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips), a CDC
official (Carlos Jacott), and a scientist (Bob Gunton), Sheila
discovers it is indeed bats (who have been genetically altered by
Gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous, in order to
be used as a military weapon!).
I have to say here that I knew exactly what I was getting into going
into this film.  There's not a frame of promotional footage I have
seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be
any good.  In this respect, the film never disappointed me.  This film
reaches a level that transcends the "so bad it's good" level and
borders on the downright insane.  The effects are awful, the script is
contrived, and for most of the feature I was laughing at things that
were supposed to be taken seriously (I think).  I challenge anyone to
sit through the scene, where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while
another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner, with a straight
face.
Thankfully, the performances are as good as they can be considering
the material the actors had to perform with.  Dina Meyer has always
been the highlight of any of the films she has been in (Johnny
Mnemonic, Dragonheart, and Starship Troopers... the latter being the
only film out of that batch with any actual merit), and this one is no
exception.  While one never really gets the impression that Meyer's
character could be a bat expert in reality, one never really cares to
doubt it either.  She gives as good a performance as could be
expected, plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half.  Lou
Diamond Phillips is also serviceable here, as the small town sheriff
turned eventual hero.  Although when we first meet his character he
knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town, for some reason
later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of
the deaths in town are because of bats.  The only bad performance in
the film is that of Leon's.  He is relegated to the "I'm not sticking
around here!" character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line
for the majority of the film even though he stays.
Anyone who can't immediately tell that Bob Gunton (the bad guy in
Patch Adams and countless other films) is going to eventually turn on
the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will
probably be surprised, but I highly doubt it.  Even if he hadn't been
the villain in just about every film he's ever been in, so many
obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no
shock whatsoever.  In fact, his death is welcome, because it finally
starts moving the plot towards the finale.
If the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet, then check out these
little tidbits: A multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a
police officer cocks his pistol.  An entire town disregards the
sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is
instigated, causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full
force, killing several townsfolk.  A government official blows off
Shelia's instructions (to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in
the bats' cave that will kill all of them off) by pulling a night job,
resulting in the death of an entire military unit.  A cavern full of
bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the
middle of it.  Finally, to top it all off, this little Texas town is
showing Nosferatu in it's single screen theater (for reference, our
town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens,
and we're lucky to even get Kevin Smith's Dogma).
The most laughable part of the movie though comes from the
ill-conceived bat puppets.  While the actual bat attack scenes are
shot with rapid fire editing (making the scenes nearly impossible to
comprehend what's going on), the scenes where a bat is called upon to
interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key.  Therefore
we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic, rubbery
bat puppets ever committed to film.  Being able to see the puppeteer's
arms would be the only things that could have made these creations
worse.
After all of this, if you still decide Bats might be the movie for
you, don't say you haven't been warned.  Trust me when I say that it's
a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through.  I just wish that
Dina Meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films
to appear in.  She's definitely a talent that is going to waste in
films like these.

Starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Dina Meyer, Bob Gunton. Rated PG-13.
Bats is this year's camp flick. With the world's worst dialogue,
cheesiest premise and stupidest editor, this one should be heaven for
those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity. As for the rest of us,
well... I'd say skip it, but looking at the box office figures for this
one, it seems as though most of America is following that advice
anyway. Follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your
life and 8 bucks to boot.
I love Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, almost as much as I love the short
story on which it is based. It saddens me even more, then, to see that
American Treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock
such as Bats. When mysterious bat attacks occur in a small Texas town,
the authorities call in a batologist (Dina Meyer) to investigate. It
turns out that a creepy scientist (Bob Gunton) has genetically enhanced
a couple bats that escaped from his lab, making them smarter and more
vicious. Why has he done this, you ask? Because, you see, it is
apparently a scientist's job to make things "a little better," even if
that means the death of all mankind.
So the batologist, her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff (Lou
Diamond Phillips) have to kill all the bats and save the world. Of
course, that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo (bat shit,
for the uninitiated), get up close and personal with some truly
repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations
ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture. Consider, for
example, a scene where two people are in a bat cave. The bats are all
sleeping, but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can
get out. What do they do? Do they get the hell out of there as fast as
they can? Nope. They stand there for a while, transfixed by the
thousands of bats opening their eyes.
What keeps Bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing
in most of the attack scenes. We don't even get to see what's going on;
the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick. All we know is
that bats are attacking. How they are attacking and what exactly is
happening remains a mystery. A little technical proficiency does
wonders for horror movies, and Bats sure could use some.
Of course, director Louis Morneau tries to liven things up with some
intentional humor, but it is so conventional it doesn't really go
anywhere. Most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's
wisecracking sidekick (Leon), who takes every opportunity to sputter
ingenious lines like "I hate bats!" Some of these are so bad that they
take on a double quality: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because they are so inept. I hate characters who
exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners. Playing such
characters does not help actors' careers.
Still, I suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is "so bad
it's good," you could do worse than Bats. It does have a tremendous
amount of camp value. I'm not "recommending" the movie because, quite
frankly, it sucks, and I know that this might convince some people to
go out and see it. More power to them.

Bats are scary.  Even though they are gentle, passive creatures that
will only bite in self-defense if they are picked up and handled, bats
still have a bad reputation.  Their presence is an indicator of a
healthy ecosystem.  They are good for the rainforest, they eat annoying
insects and their rate of rabies infection isn't more than any other
species (about 1 in 1,000).  But try rationalizing this to a person that
has a bat swooping around their attic at night and you are likely to
find yourself trampled by said person.
In Bats, the first offering from new Hollywood player Destination Films,
the director of Carnosaur 2 (Louis Morneau) is teamed with Gladiator
screenwriter John Logan to make one of the worst films of the year, if
not the entire decade.  It's not scary.  In fact, that Bugs Bunny
cartoon with the vampire that turns into a half-man/half-bat after
hearing the words `Hocus Cadabra' was scarier.  The filmmakers and
actors think they're making an Oscar contender, while they should be
playing everything with a sarcastic edge  like in Lake Placid.
Bats takes place in Gallup, Texas, and in the first scene we watch the
token young couple attacked by killer bats that claw their way through
the ragtop car roof and chomp on the teens' jugulars.  Flash to the
Arizona desert, where Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer, Starship Troopers), a
wildlife zoologist with a specialty in Chiroptera, is in a cave studying
docile bats with her idiotic sidekick Jimmy (León, OZ).  A chopper from
the Center for Disease Control lands nearby and whisks the two off to
Gallup to help them investigate the grisly deaths.
As it turns out, these bloodthirsty bats were actually a decade-long
government experiment that took Flying Foxes  an Indonesian bat with a
six-foot wingspan  and genetically increased their natural
intelligence, developed their ability to work as a team, as well as
making them aggressive and carnivorous.  Two of these killing machines
have escaped and infected the entire bat population of Gallup.  Their
creator, Dr. McCabe (Bob Gunton, Patch Adams), is one of the lamest evil
scientists in the history of movie bad guys.
Together with local Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips, I Lost
my Wife to Melissa Etheridge), Casper and the bat-phobic Jimmy
brainlessly try to think of ways of stopping the bats from escalating
their nightly attacks on the town.  Their big idea is to hole up in the
school, covering each door and window with electrified chain-link
fencing, despite the fact that the bats were able to squeeze through a
car's ventilation system in an earlier scene.  How would a chain-link
fence be any more protective?
Kimsey, Casper and Jimmy proceed to an abandoned mine, where the throngs
of bats have congregated.  The Army is trying to trap them in the mine
and annihilate them using a large refrigeration device, since cold
temperatures are lethal to the winged critters.  But the bats wipe out
the Army, too, leaving Kimsey and Casper to venture into the mine
wearing what resembles scuba gear.  This, despite knowing that the bats
gnawed their way through a ragtop car roof.
Kimsey, in all of the wisdom his shallow character can muster, turns and
fires a pistol at the approaching bats as he flees the mine.  There are
millions of them - what does he think a few bullets would do?  This is
after he and Casper were chest-deep in a river of bat guano and he
decided to light a flare.  Maybe I don't know a lot about bats or the
flammability of their guano, but I would have second and third thoughts
about introducing flame to large amounts of the dung of any animal.  And
speaking of bat knowledge, aren't they supposed to be blind?  On several
occasions, the director offers a view from the perspective of a bat,
which is apparently red-hued and slanty.
Bats is a terrible mess when it should be a tongue-in-cheek mockery of
the genre.  The writer's idea of intentional laughs are León's awful
one-liners that fall as flat as Meyer's tummy.  He's a Chris Tucker
wannabe; a black Shaggy without the sidekick, left to lifelessly shout
dumb stuff like, `I don't like the sound of that,' `I hate this shit'
and the inevitably original `Damn.'  Hopefully, Logan's next script 
Oliver Stone's Christmas football pic Any Given Sunday  will be a bit
crisper. Morneau's action sequences are choppy and tough to make out,
and although the disgusting bats resemble a certain senior Senator from
North Carolina, they fail to terrify.
1:30 - PG-13 for bat attacks and adult language

IN SHORT: Guano. Perfect for 10 year olds.
Here we have a timed-for-Halloween-release scareflick about killer bats.
We're not talking small, potentially frightening domestic bats, which
don't eat meat. We're talking imported, endangered species variety,
genetically engineered to become perfect, controllable soldiers in the
war against who the hell knows what.
>From the pounding music accompanying the fast visual cuts slashing
across the screen, even before the opening credits hit, Cranky knew
(from experience) that this was going to be painful. A random attack
somewhere in Texas takes down two teens who had been debating whether he
was scum and whether she should put out. Typical teen stuff. Then, in a
flash, something attacks their car, fast cut, fast cut, fast cut, and
they're dead. A terrible start.
We meet eminent bat researcher Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) and her
assistant Jimmy (Leon), pulled from a research assignment by a high
powered suit (Carlos Jacott) from the Center for Disease Control. With
him is the mysterious scientist, Dr. Alexander McCabe (Bob Gunton), who
bears a remarkable resemblance to a guy who used to sell frozen peas on
TV for a local supermarket chain. But I digress...
Down in Texas, the local badge belongs to Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou
Diamond Phillips) who appreciates the high tech equipment that's been
choppered into his town. Problem is, anyone who has sat through any
number of would be scary flicks can see almost everything coming a
thousand miles away. The scientist has a secret. Check. The government
is somehow involved (but I'm not telling how). Check. One character
sacrifices him/herself to save another. Check. The black guy makes
jokes. Check. The dialog is funny without meaning to be. Double check.
Cranky, and the other reviewers, were almost rolling in the aisles -- we
weren't supposed to, but when you get lines like "I'm a Scientist. It's
What We Do." pronounced with all the self-importance of a Papal decree,
well, that's how incredibly tacky and dumb John Logan's screenplay is.
Director Louis Morneau uses a special lens to give us the "bat's eye
view" from time to time. Problem is, he uses the effect when there
aren't bats around, wasting the concept.
      Now remember that bats, the animal, move with stealth and can
attack before you know they're there. Bats are supposed to instill fear
and scare folk, and we all know what they did to a young Bruce Wayne,
which led Joel Schumacher to make to a pair of movies even worse than
this one. I'll be blunt about this. The only saving grace of Bats, the
movie, is to be found in the special effects. I'm talking about swarms
of bats attacking trucks, buildings, battering their way into locked off
spaces. With effects split between different companies, some of 'em
work. Some of 'em look cheesy. The models of the bats themselves, are so
damned ugly they're almost funny to look at, as they stalk their
victims.
But the first major attack, on a truck bearing our beloved pair of
heroes, is so damned cool looking that Cranky wonders what this thing
could've become if better hands where on the wheel.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Bats, he would have paid...
Dumb dialog. Little tension. Some nice effects. If you don't care about
story and just want the effects, fine. If my nephew were ten, he'd
gobble this up with a spoon.

`Bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror
movie fan. To pull something like this off, you need to have a sense of
wit and style, with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if
the fright factor ever declines. Something like the underground worm
thriller `Tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements, and
in return, the film was tremendous fun. With the notable exception of a
wisecracking supporting player, `Bats' mainly plays it's premise for
straight-arrow horror. Judging by the ridiculous premise, this was not
exactly a wise move.
The movie attempts to capture the essence of Alfred Hitchcock's `The
Birds', but fails miserably. Done right, it could have been adequately
amusing Halloween cinema. Unfortunately, `Bats' is a prime example of a
formula movie done terribly, terribly wrong. The only thing amusing
about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers
anticipate their core audience to be. I will recite the following
paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to
whom `Bats' is aimed toward.
Those guys in Hollywood have made a movie about bats. These bats are not
very nice, because they eat a lot of people. Boy, are these bats ugly.
They are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper
smart. They've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly
at all. A whole bunch of people in Texas get killed, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats. They have big guns
and other cool things to fight them with, but the bats are pretty smart,
so it's sorta hard to do. The bats swoop down and they shoot at them to
make they go away for good.
But no, `Bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers. The film,
directed by Louis Morneau, should have ventured straight into video
stores. On the small screen, perhaps more fun could have been derived
with lower expectations. But sitting through this crapper on the big
screen is almost awkward; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty
pleasure, the film is poorly written, poorly acted and executed with
glaring ineptitude. Even the bats themselves are cheesy, and the attack
sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed.
The sheriff in the story is Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), who
embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually
portrays (he chomps on a cigar, struts contentedly in his boots,
etc...). The scientist is Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer), who
specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her
field'. Meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie
seem more intellectually capable, but everything about Dr. Casper is
recycled beyond recognition. Her memories of how she became hooked on
the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like Oceanographic student Matt
Hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `Jaws'.
Everything revolving around `Bats' is tired drivel, which desperately
requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up.
The supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw, with
voices dubbed in later. In fact, that may have worked out better in the
end. Take one glance at Casper's bat-loathing sidekick Jimmy (Leon), and
you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy
caricature from every other movie, constructed specifically for timed
comic relief. Unfortunately, none of his comic interludes are funny. In
the role of deranged mad scientist Dr. McCabe, the reliable Bob Gunton
gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch.
McCabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects, and the
virus spread to other bats. The entire town of Gallup, Texas is under
attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures, but Gunton appears to be
inconspicuously contemplating something else. Something like: `When is
the damn movie going to be over?? I just want my money.'
The bats are ugly, I must say. There's the occasional moment where they
look moderately convincing, but mainly, the swarm is represented in
cheesy digital imagery. Only bits of the bloody action even hint at the
campy fun the film could have been, but by the absurdly stupid climax,
it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery. Characters
experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire. Let's explore the
logic there: is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat
population?? You could empty an entire clip at the flying winged
serpents and not even wound one, and after that there are only 18, 000
more of them. This kind of behavior represents the regular level of
intelligence behind `Bats'.
