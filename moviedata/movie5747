"The Graduate" is a good comedy that has generally
been over-rated over the years.  While the film
launched Dustin Hoffman's career, it is by no means
his best film (my bets are on "Little Big Man").
Most of the humor works, which admittedly is the
point, but the characters of Hoffman and Ross
lack consistency and motivation.
Perhaps "The Graduate" should have been called
"The Three Faces of Dustin" instead.  Benjamin
(Hoffman) has just graduated from college, but
continues to live at home.  He is polite and
earnest.  He is seduced by his father's partner's
wife, middle-aged Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft).
As the furtive affair continues, Benjamin becomes
secretive and dissipated.  Mrs. Robinson's daughter,
Elaine (Katherine Ross) returns home from college.
Under pressure from his parents, Benjamin dates
Elaine but soon falls for her.  This leads to
The Third Face of Dustin, the obsessed Stalker,
as he tries to get her to marry him.
Benjamin is extremely naive for a college graduate
with his golden resume, which includes captain
of the track team and editor of the college
newspaper.  It doesn't help that Hoffman was thirty
years old in 1967, nearly ten years older than his
character.  His first encounter with Bancroft
at a swank hotel is endearingly clumsy, but not
completely credible.  After several such encounters,
he still refers to her as "Mrs. Robinson".  You
think they'd be on a first name basis by then.
Katherine Ross is lovely, but her character seems
to just go with the flow.  When Benjamin is cruel
to her, she cries.  When he wants to make up, she
agrees.  Benjamin stalks her, and she believes that
he raped her mother.  So, why does she show up at
his apartment.  And agree to marry him against her
parent's wishes and her better judgment?  And
whatever happened to the beautiful brand new Alfa
Romeo? If he doesn't want it, I'll take it!
Look fast for Richard Dreyfuss.  He's the guy who
wants to call the police.  Buck Henry, who also
co-wrote the screenplay, has a small part, as does
Norman Fell.  All three are funny.
The soundtrack is full of Simon & Garfunkel tunes.
The soundtrack had as much success as the film,
topping the charts.  The tunes are wimpy but still
very good.
"The Graduate" won the Oscar for Best Director
(Mike Nichols).  The film was nominated for many
other Academy Awards, including Best Picture,
Best Actor (Hoffman), Best Actress (Bancroft), Best
Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography (Robert
Surtees), and Best Supporting Actress (Ross).

THE GRADUATE, a terrific movie that paved the way for the careers of
Dustin Hoffman and Mike Nichols, whose only previous directorial
experience was in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRIGINA WOOLF?, will long be remembered
in the years to come.  THE GRADUATE follows the events of recent
college-grad Benjamin Braddock, a young man who is "concerned about his
future", as one of the original theatrical posters put it.  
Benjamin is the son of a businessman, and, when he returns home from
college, he finds himself becoming involved with the wife of his father's
business partner - Mrs. Robinson.  You know, "And here's to you Mrs.
Robinson . . . ".  After a short series of flings with her, Benjamin finds
himself wondering what he is doing.  His parents want him to take out
Elaine Robinson, the daughter of Mrs. Robinson.  Benjamin doesn't think
that she likes him very much, and Mrs. Robinson forbids him to take her
out.  He does anyway, in an attempt to steer her away.  His means for
doing this are driving erratically, walking ahead of her throughout the
date, and taking her to a type of strip-show where he displays more
interest in the performers than her.  His plan works well, but he finds
himself feeling sorry for her and decides to pursue her more.  After
attempting to put Mrs. Robinson out of the picture, Benjamin concentrates
fully on Elaine.  But Mrs. Robinson is determined to put an end to it, and
the events that follow are a great piece of work involving Benjamin trying
to avoid Mrs. Robinson and to regain Elaine Robinson.  Eventually,
Benjamin learns that Elaine is to be married to another man, and he
decides it is upon himself to rescue her.
THE GRADUATE is a very memorable movie with many unforgettable scenes, and
Dustin Hoffman's performance is extremely good.  Definitely a must-see
movie.  You'll need to see it in order to understand all the references to
the "Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me . . ." line.

Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is in between the realms of the
sheltered life and reality.  He has just graduated from a prestigious
Ivy League university and his parents are throwing a party for him
downstairs and have invited all their wealthy friends.  Most of the
guests have known Benjamin since he was born and all of them are proud
of his outstanding achievement at the school.  Yet, he sits hiding in
his room with his fishes, worried sick about his uncertain future.
He finally consents to go downstairs and greet those at the party.
Everyone congratulates him and he smiles cordially.  One of the guests
takes him aside and tells him one word: "Plastics."  The man promises
Ben that it is a promising and flourishing industry and urges him to
consider working for such a company.  Ben escapes to his room upstairs.
Enter Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and so begins perhaps the
quintessential American sex farce, The Graduate.  The movie is subtle
hilarity and sarcastic confusion.  Mrs. Robinson practically forces Ben
to take her home because her husband has supposedly left with the car.
She commands him to come with her inside because she is too afraid to
come into a dark house alone.  She forces alcohol upon him.  She puts on
some music and she asks, "What do you think of me?"  It is obvious this
is a seduction.
After much beating around the bush, she removes her clothes and bluntly
tells Ben that if he is ever in need of some gratification, she will be
more than happy to provide it.  This is after she vows to Ben she is not
flirting with him.  Obviously Ben is frightened by this woman.  He flees
the house but, strangely enough, calls her at a hotel and asks for her
company.  He is reluctant to give away his morals and virginity to this
sexy woman who is twice his age.  She toys with him and he snaps and
gives in to her temptation.  They have an affair.
I am not a big Dustin Hoffman fan but his character, Ben, is painfully
delightful.  Trying to cope with his newfound adulthood, he has a fling
with his father's partner's wife and then falls in love with her
daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).  Anne Bancroft is sly, shrewd, sexy,
scary, and fun and her Mrs. Robinson becomes the Dark Force of the
film.  She is the barrier between Ben and Elaine.  There is a tad bit of
vulnerability to her in earlier scenes in which she tells Ben of her
failed marriage, her lack of interest in life, and her loneliness but
the film turns on her and makes her a delectable villain.
By the end, I got the notion that this was a simple conventional love
story made unconventional by all the sexual comedy.  I think that is
what The Graduate is.  It is no masterpiece but it certainly is a heck
of a film.  The sardonic sexual coloring of the film seems to overshadow
the bare love story, making the film definitely not about love but a
combination of sexual satire and the corny desires for freedom.
Simon & Garfunkel's score fills The Graduate with a gloominess and
somber quality.  "Sounds of Silence," "Scarborough Fair," and "Mrs.
Robinson" are great songs and while, inside the movie they sound a bit
like elevator music, they do add a sort of quiet in an otherwise pungent
movie.
This was the motion picture breakthrough for Dustin Hoffman, Katharine
Ross, and the amazing director Mike Nichols.  The Graduate has a
late-60s atmosphere aided but exceptional cinematography, appealing and
creative editing, and a point-of-view style at the beginning of the
movie.  The Graduate is not a very practical movie, especially when
dealing with the Ben-Elaine love story.  Elaine seems to be
unrealistically forgiving.  The movie also forgives Ben for wrongly
having an affair with Mrs. Robinson- as if Mrs. Robinson were the only
contributor to their sin.  But that seems to be beside the point by the
end because The Graduate, after subsequent viewings, seems to be more of
a cartoon than anything else and its satirical take on its subject is
both enjoyable and, at times, astounding.
