A wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and
in its theme.
The scene of "Second Best" is laid in Wales. James (Chris Cleary Miles)
is a 10-year-old boy who must live in a home because his father (Keith
Allen) is in prison and his mother committed suicide. James is a
mentally unbalanced child. He can't forget what happened in the past,
and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father. In the
home he feels sadly and lonely. One day, a social worker (Alan Cumming)
teels him of a person who wants to adopt him. This person is Graham Holt
(William Hurt). Graham manages a post office and shop in a village. He
is a single and hasn't any real friends. His mother is dead, and his
father is ill and will die. Graham feels that he has been a
disappointment to his parents. There has never been real love between
his parents and him. Graham's monotonous life would get a new sense if
he could adopt James. But Graham has not only to convince the
institutions, but must also win the love of James. James and Graham have
to open theirselves. They must get to know each other and learn to
understand and trust the other person. James and Graham aid each other
to cope with their problems. But will their relationship really have a
future?
"Second Best" is based on a novel by David Cook who also wrote the
screenplay. The film was directed by Chris Menges who had made his
directing debut with the very good anti-Apartheid drama "A World Apart"
(1987/88). And maybe, "Second Best" is even a greater picture.
This precise, richly detailed, sensitively and convincingly directed
study about a special adoption treat its theme with great seriousness.
The breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and
communication. William Hurt delivers an outstanding performance as
Graham Holt. And Chris Cleary Miles is remarkably convincing in the role
of the boy. The supporting cast is also fine (especially Jane Horrocks
as Debbie, a social worker who is charged to examine Graham's living
circumstances).
"Second Best" is an underestimated masterpiece. It's a pity that films
like this one are made so seldom.
I eagerly await Menges' next directorial work, "The Lost Son", which
will star Daniel Auteuil.

     SECOND BEST is about a 42-year old Welsh man (William Hurt) who
has never been married and has hardly ever even had a girlfriend.  He
decides to adopt a boy, but being a single man, he is told that he will
only be offered older boys who are mentally disturbed.
     A 10 year old boy (Christopher Miles) comes to live with him in
his tiny Welsh village where he is the postmaster and local grocer.  As
promised, this boy is troubled.  He comes from a LORD OF THE FLIES sort
of past, and his Dad (Keith Allen), whom he loves dearly, has been in
prison for a long time.  He and his Dad made a pact, before his Dad
left to go to prison, to love each other more than anyone else forever.
     The show happens as much in the past as in the present and tells
not only the boy's past but Hurt's as well.  The interest in the show
is provided by Hurt's character more than the boy's although the script
was written, I think, to have the movie center around the boy.
     Hurt plays a repressed man who looks at the world as if he is
scared to venture into it.  The scenes where the boys trashes his house
and he just stares without speaking were a bit much even for his
withdrawn character.  I did not buy these scenes.  On the whole though,
Hurt plays it very convincingly, and you feel really sorry for him.
     The main problem in the show for me was the casting of the boy.
He was supposed to be an enigma, but he carried it overboard.  During
most of the movie it was hard to understand anything at all about what
the boy was feeling and hence hard to empathize with him.  The director
(Chris Menges) should have realized this and given him better guidance.
     All of the minor characters were quite good except the role played
by John Hurt (no relation to William) which seemed to be out of another
movie.  My favorite minor character was Jane Horrocks's portrayal of
the social worker.  She was the only funny character in the movie and
every one of her lines was a riot.  I wish her part had been made
larger.  Given that everyone loved her in LIFE IS SWEET whereas I hated
her in it, I was surprised myself at how enchanted I was with her
acting in SECOND BEST.
     Just watching the movie may make you want to move to the serenity
of Wales - lovely cinematography (Ashley Rowe).  On the other hand, it
may scare you away from ever adopting a troubled child.  A lot of the
movie was either sad or disturbing because of the subject matter.
     The movie runs 1:45 and is rated PG-13 for self-inflicted bloody
wounds and some frightening subject matter.  I think it would be okay
for mature teenagers.  I recommend this serious movie to you and give
** 1/2.
