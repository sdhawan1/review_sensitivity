**1/2 (out of 4) LOVE STINKS is the Antichrist of romantic comedies.
It's a "guy" movie, but it follows some of the rules of chick flicks.
What it does with them, though, is push them through a bitter, black
filter. The result is either an incomprehensible mess, or revenge for
FIRST WIVES' CLUB, depending on your point of view.
I am ashamed to admit that I thought this movie was funny. Immediately
after it was over, my wife said she thought it deserved the lowest
rating possible, and I overheard another woman on the phone tell a
friend that it was "not very good." On the other hand, several men in
the theater hooted at all the right moments, and I found myself laughing
along with them.
Why be ashamed to laugh at a comedy? Why do men and women react
differently? Because the "villain" (Chelsea, played by Bridgette Wilson)
is the embodiment of a stereotype: a matrimony-obsessed, man-trapping
woman. I feel guilty because I'm a sensitive man who should be above
such an immature view of women. (But then I also like Beavis and
Butt-Head, so I guess I'm not as sensitive or mature as I thought.)
Chelsea is a neurotic FEMME FATALE who aims to either marry Seth (French
Stewart) or kill him trying. Think of Glenn Close in BASIC INSTINCT, but
less psychotic and more comedic, and you'll start to get an idea of who
she is. Admittedly, she's not a very well-rounded character. She's more
a situation than a person.
Seth is a sitcom writer living in a bachelor-pad wasteland. He's not
looking for a new girlfriend, but when he sees Chelsea, he becomes
infatuated. He dumps his current girlfriend to go out with the new one.
Chelsea is a decorator and "professional bridesmaid," as she likes to
say (they met at a friend's wedding). But as soon as she's in Seth's
life, she gives it all up to be his personal decorator and stay-at-home
girlfriend.
The movie follows their progress as a couple, through the tumultuous
saying of "I love you" to talking about children. Through bickering and
fighting to serious discussions about marriage. Through it all (and with
the help of the narrator), you can see the subtle manipulative
implementation of Chelsea's scheme to win Seth's hand.
Eventually, Seth decides he'd rather not be with Chelsea. But somehow,
she manages to keep him living under the same roof. Pretty soon they are
engaged - in an all-out War of the Roses. (God help me for saying it,
but this movie actually has a funny fart joke.)
But in spite of my amusement, I will not recommend it. Some of the
bigger problems are that Seth and Chelsea's friends (Tyra Banks, Bill
Bellamy) are too similar and badly developed. They could have provided
some sort of grounded contrast to the exaggerated love/hate. Instead,
they are almost exact duplicates of the main couple. Also, some of the
jokes are uninspired and cheap, like Seth's fascination with Elvis, or
Chelsea's devotion to her cat. Worst of all is the utter
two-dimensionality of most of the characters, including all of the
women.
LOVE STINKS fills a niche that is so far pretty empty. It's an inverted
chick-flick. It's a romantic comedy for cynical men. That probably makes
it dumber and meaner than a lot of other movies. If you go, don't laugh.
And if you laugh, don't say I sent you.

"I'm gonna sue your ass for damages; FOR DAMAGING MY ASS!!!"
Starring French Stewart, Bridgette Wilson, Bill Bellamy, Tyra Banks.
Rated R.
The anti-romantic comedy is a genre (and it is a genre) that can never
aim for blockbuster status at the box-office. Who wants to see a comedy
about bad relationships? Most people have enough of that in their own
lives. To kick off the 1999 fall season, here's a movie -- and a good
one -- that tries to play off that notion. Touting the eye-catching
tagline "A Movie About a Relationship that's Worse than Yours," Love
Stinks, a shamelessly hilarious comedy, says that it's all right to
laugh at people's romantic travails.
3rd Rock From the Sun vet French Stewart gets his first shot at a
leading role playing Seth Winnick, a successful sitcom writer who falls
for Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson), a spunky interior decorator. Seth is
well-intentioned, but his new girlfriend has just one thing on her mind:
marriage. She is manipulative and deceitful -- even more so than most
other women (sorry, couldn't resist) -- and is willing to go to almost
any length to get an engagement ring out of the indecisive Seth, who,
in, turn refuses to say that he doesn't want to marry Chelsea but
doesn't propose either.
As his romance with Chelsea gets worse and worse, so does his sitcom
(which he likes to base partly on his life), and he is in danger of
losing his job. Chelsea doesn't seem to care; she schemes and plots all
the more intensely to walk down the isle with Seth. But when after a
year of waiting, Seth gives her diamond earrings instead of a ring, she
goes bonkers, moves out and slaps Seth with a palimony suit, leaving him
with nothing to do but think up a scheme of his own.
After I realized that the first 15 minutes of Love Stinks stunk, I was
starting to get psyched for actively hating the rest of it. But the
comedy picked up and before I knew it, I was laughing hysterically and
immensely enjoying this irresistably anarchic production. Indeed, Jeff
Franklin's (I can just hear a tv spot announcing "From the man behind
Full House comes an audacious comedy in the spirit of American Pie...")
film breaks every rule of the romantic comedy and does it with such glee
that even when a gag is fully predictable it's still entertaining.
I can see people perceiving Love Stinks to be a tirade against women. At
first glance, that's just what it seems to be. But, as the trailer for
the upcoming American Beauty proclaims, "Look closer." Everything that
transpires in the film is as much the guy's doing as it is the girl's.
The film's final twist shows us that it's not only women who can be
scheming and manipulative.
French Stewart is engaging, though slightly irritating as the unwilling
potential groom-to-be. His voice started to get on my nerves about
halfway though, but it's a respectable first lead performance. Bridgette
Wilson is deliciously bad-grrl, but Tyra Banks, who plays Chelsea's
friend should keep her day job (she's a supermodel). Under the laid-back
direction of Franklin, we tend to notice mostly the good in the
performances; the flaws are masked by hilarity.
The most important virtue of Love Stinks is that it is very, very funny.
The gags come at a furious pace, and even the ones that don't work
manage to supplement the film's purposefully unromantic atmosphere. If
it were a romantic comedy, it would be one of the best ones of the year;
as it stands, Love Stinks is a glorious antidote to the romantic comedy.
It's a movie about a relationship that's worse than yours. Go see it.

Attending Love Stinks more than a month before it actually opens, I am actually
here with my first movie review (imagine me, 12, and seeing a special
screening!) before a movie opens. Luckily, I saw Love Stinks, a film that
reminds us just how funny well-used bathroom humor can be.
Seth Winnick (Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock From the Sun) is a writer for a new
sitcom called Jesse & Rebecca. He meets Chelsea (Wilson) at his fellow writer's
wedding. Instantly overcome with love he brings to the planetarium to dance
under the stars, and their romance begins. She redecorates his apartment and
makes him get allergy shots to live with her beloved cat, but she soon becomes
more and more controlling. 
But what Chelsea is really after is someone to marry. On Valentine's Day Seth
says he might marry her in a year, and she settles for it. But when I comes
around that time next year, he doesn't propose. She sues him for palimony and
begins ruining his life, he does the same to her. Throwing her cat off a pier
(could that be a inspiration from There's Something About Mary popping up
again?) and inviting over the sexy bimbo she asked him not to cast on his show.
Yes, the film contains a lot of bathroom humor. However, (I am ashamed to say)
that most of it is pretty darn funny. Another nice thing about Love Stinks is
the way that the story is told in flashbacks. Stewart gives a fine performance,
although his character seems very Harry-ized (read 2nd paragraph) and I wonder
if he can do any other types of acting. Also performing well is Tyra Banks, in
her movie debut, she adds a different touch to some of the scenes.
Looking for an intelligent and witty sophisticated film? Not one ounce is to be
found here, but if your just looking to laugh regularly in a darkened theater
for 90 minutes or so, see Love Stinks which gets ** 1/2 stars.

Starring: French Stewart (3rd Rock), Bridgette Wilson (Billy Madison, Mortal
Kombat), Tyra Banks (supermodel), Bill Bellamy (MTV guy), Tiffani-Amber
Thiessen (90210 vixen), and Jason Bateman (one of those Hogans)
Jeff Franklin (Director/Writer)
In the new movie "Love Stinks", French Stewart plays Seth, a funny TV writer
who is smitten with the likes of Chelsea, the matron of honor at his best
friend's wedding.  Seth and Chelsea hit it off and start dating and that is
where the fun begins.
As Chelsea quickly insinuates herself into every corner of Seth's life, he
has no recourse but to accept the inevitable.  French's quips on the demise
of his freedom are high points of the first act.  Even funnier is when the
relationship turns adversarial and Chelsea shows herself to be the psycho
that was always just underneath her perfectly molded surface.
 I'm not one for toilet humor but when Seth tried to get her out of their
bed by bombarding her with nocturnal odors, I almost laughed up a kidney.
As their "war of the roses" escalates, so does the comedy.
Co-stars Bill Bellamy and Tyra Banks do a fine job as the respective best
friends of our combatants.  Cameos by Tifanni-Amber Thiessen and Jason
Bateman parodying themselves as TV stars is also handled with great aplomb.
If your comedic tastes match your culinary ones, this is a good meat and
potatoes comedy that should leave you feeling very satisfied.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Love Stinks
Rated [R], 93 minutes
Starring French Stewart, Bridgette Wilson, Tyra Banks, Bill
Bellamy;       Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Steve Hytner, Jason Bateman
Written and Directed by Jeff Franklin

IN SHORT: The kind of story that requires you to have a decade or so of
dating hell under your belt, to appreciate the niddling nastiness that
plays out on screen.
Before we begin: In Cranky's last day of film school screenwriting
class, oh so many years ago, the teacher (in real life a script reader
for a major studio) warned us about the art of titles. Her main
suggestions: be very sure of your work, especially if you give your
project a title that the critics can use against you.
That would include words like "stinks", which aptly describes the first
15 or so minutes of writer/director Jeff Franklin's debut on the big
screen, after a very successful career on the small. That quarter hour
kickoff is so totally unfunny that one critic walked out of the press
screening. His loss, 'cuz from that point on, slowly but surely, Love
Stinks develops as an insidious and occasionally hilarious black comedy.
It's a small story, told in flashback from the toilet of a Las Vegas
bound jet. Inside said cubicle are best buds and TV sitcom writing
partners Seth Winnick (French Stewart) and Larry Garnett (Bill Bellamy).
Yeah, think all you want about the Mile High Club, I warned you that the
set up to this flick stinks. A year earlier, Larry married the ever
scrumptious Holly (Tyra Banks) and groomsman Seth met bride's maid
Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). It was lust at first sight for Seth, Chelsea
knew immediately that he was "the one." From that moment on, well once
they dumped their dates, it was a fast track through the self-proclaimed
rules of when to hit the hay and generate tremors readable on the
Richter scale, even though she's a cat person and he's into dogs.
Before Chelsea turns into a angry, nasty, manipulative, controlling
rhymes-with-witch, she gets to parade around in lingerie and garters.
Which is a lovely diversion while French Stewart searches for the
background of the character he's portraying. After a year of waiting,
Chelsea goes ballistic because Seth presents her with diamond earrings
instead of a singular diamond ring. For his part, the battles are more
fodder to plug into his hit sitcom which allows California palimony laws
a full field of action to play on.
What makes Love Stinks different from, say, The War of the Roses is that
all the battles are fought on a very small field. Think of it this way:
if everything that your partner does that annoys you, that you still
ignore, were pushed just a bit further, how would you increase the vice
versa while trying to maintain some kind of civility? Cranky got sucked
into the humor when the flatulence jokes were unleashed -- 'cuz it comes
in the same way it does for all of us who have been coupled up, in bed.
Yes, I'm making a broad assumption here, but the comedy goes much
broader but no further down the toilet. Warren Zevon put it simply in a
song title many years ago, "Lawyers, Guns and Money..." but what is a
very small movie turned from painful to painless in a relatively short
period of time.
On the negative tech side, Franklin's teevee roots show. Love Stinks
looks like a television shoot, all close-ups or medium close-ups shot
well within the crop lines etched onto a film camera's viewfinder. Extra
points are deducted for allowing a sound boom to be seen in his visual
field.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Love Stinks, he would have paid . .
