Keywords: author=polenz
A top judge from Ohio is selected to be the new head of the DEA and learns 
the ropes of America's war on drugs while at the same time having to deal 
with the fact his  own daughter is an addict. Several other subplots 
intertwine with this story including a pair of detectives who have brought 
down a local drug dealer and need him to testify against an even bigger 
trafficker whose wife never knew what he REALLY did for a living. Also, a 
fearless Mexican police officer plays both sides of the law against each 
other while he unknowingly helps one drug lord wipe out the top rival. There 
is no one central plot to the film, just these three stories overlapping with 
dozens of supporting characters playing vital roles. 
Top-notch performances by the cast give the serious-as-a-heart attack story 
even more depth and credence. Direction by Steven Soderbergh is magnificent 
in successfully bringing all the characters and stories together combined 
with superb cinematography. Each subplot is shot in a unique way giving them 
their own mood and motif - quite a risky move for such a mainstream Hollywood 
movie. If "Traffic" isn't great for its powerful and relevant theme it at 
least works as an entertaining character drama reminiscent of Paul Thomas 
Anderson's style. 
The notion of the nation's top drug czar the clueless father of a junkie is 
trite, forced and quite unbelievable at times. The message this film is 
trying to send comes across loud and clear, but usually it's subtle themes 
that make great movies truly great. Later, when we see Michael Douglas (the 
czar) driving through the ghettos looking for his daughter it's hard not to 
laugh at him. He's driving around in his Mercedes assuming that since he is 
in the bad part of town it's a guarantee that's where his daughter will be. 
The subplot involving the two detectives and their key witness is utterly 
predictable and when the good housewife suddenly becomes the kingpin in her 
husband's absence it's also quite difficult to swallow. And the third-string 
plot about the Mexican cop is kind of confusing. 
Soderbergh's direction is excellent but another draft of the screenplay would 
really have smoothed out the many bumps in the story. At least all the actors 
are excellent in their respective roles, making even the most hackneyed 
scenes come off as serious and realistic as they are intended. 
This film could have been a masterpiece but the final cut can't balance the 
poignant theme with the need to cram in so many characters, so many 
storylines and a few too many typical Hollywood stunts and gimmicks. At least 
20 minutes could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the theme. 
Have you ever read an in-depth article in Rolling Stone or the New York Times 
about the facts of this war? It's astonishing when you realize how much money 
is spent and how little progress has been made. So many people are in jail 
for such small drug offenses and so many upstanding members of the law 
enforcement community have died or suffered in one way or another doing 
something they have been told is such a noble, worthy cause. This film begs 
the question, "Is all this effort really worth it? Is this the best way to 
attack this problem?" 
Still, "Traffic" earns high acclaim from me for its courage to tell such a 
condescending story about the war on drugs so well. This is one of those 
movies that really makes you think because it has such relevance to the world 
we live in - you may even recognize the characters and the scenarios from 
your own life. It's a movie you'll debate your friends and family about - and 
that's what it wants to do.

A sprawling, candid mosaic of the controversial, bitter war on drugs in the 
United States, Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic," loosely based on the 1989 BBC 
miniseries, "Traffik," offers no easy answers, nor does he attempt to 
sugarcoat the bleak topic into something that can ever change in today's 
society. Presenting a wide array of characters from different social 
standings, and showing how drugs have the power to impact everyone's life in 
one way or another, the film is truly spellbinding and often 
thought-provoking from its beginning to the end, 2 1/2-hours later.
Filmed in alternate, cleverly chosen hues, depending on where the scene is 
set and which storyline we are involved in, director Soderbergh (who also 
acted as the cameraman, under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) adapts a 
"you-are-there" style of filmmaking, with shaky, hand-held shots, and a 
screenplay, expertly developed by Stephen Gaghan, that is never anything less 
than convincing. The enormous, flawlessly-chosen cast, with each performance 
pitch-perfect, work as a unit in order to bring their roles to life, aiding 
in the entire picture's almost frightening, harsh realism. And Steven 
Soderbergh (who had great luck earlier in the year with the more mainstream, 
yet inferior, "Erin Brockovich") joins Robert Altman (1975's "Nashville") and 
Paul Thomas Anderson (1999's "Magnolia") as one of the only contemporary 
filmmakers to successfully make an ensemble film with such an ambitious, epic 
scope.
The first subplot is set in Tijuana, with Javier Rodriguez (Benecio Del Toro) 
and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) two cops out to bust a planned cocaine 
transfer in the middle of the desert. Their plan goes awry when Army General 
Salazar (Tomas Milian) intercepts, later employing Javier and Manolo to find 
and capture hired assassin Francisco Flores (Clifton Collins Jr.), who is, in 
turn, linked to wealthy drug dealer Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer).
Living in San Diego, California, Carlos is arrested and handcuffed, much to 
the dismay of his pampered wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Helena, who 
is six months pregnant with her second child, is clueless as to why her 
husband has been taken to prison until she is clued in by her defense lawyer 
Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) on why they, in fact, have so much money. 
Desperate to get Carlos off the hook, and with her son in danger if she 
doesn't come up with $3-million, Helena finds herself taking over her 
husband's illegal business in an attempt to return everything to the way it 
was.
Meanwhile, Ohio Supreme Court Justice Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is 
appointed Drug Czar for Washington, D.C., which takes him away from his 
Cincinatti-based family for long stretches of time. As Robert prepares to 
grasp the U.S.'s drug problems by the throat, he has no idea that his 
16-year-old daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), a straight-A honor 
student, has been introduced by her prep school friends to freebasing heroin, 
and is slowly wavering out of control.
In the style of the aforementioned "Nashville" and "Magnolia," there are no 
main characters in "Traffic," nor are there any outright heroes or villains. 
The movie features, not one, but many different plotlines, each of which 
evolves as things do in real life, rather than the way they are expected to 
by the viewer. And every actor stunningly supports the next as they portray 
flawed individuals who have, in some way, become involved with today's 
distressing drug culture.
The performances are first-rate across the board, any one of which is more 
than worthy of notice. Benicio Del Toro (2000's "The Way of the Gun") is 
almost always the standout feature of any movie in which his presence graces, 
and he is no exception here. As the inherently honest Javier, Del Toro steals 
the show whenever he appears, and proves what an extraordinary physical aura 
he gives off, reminiscent of Russell Crowe or Brad Pitt. It seems Del Toro is 
almost too big of a star to even fit on camera, let alone in any movie that 
is nothing less than equal to his talents.
As DEA agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro, whose sting operation of drug 
dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) leads them to the arrest of Carlos Ayala, 
Don Cheadle (1997's "Boogie Nights") and Luis Guzman ("Magnolia") develop a 
close-relationed camaraderie that acts as one of the major emotional centers 
of the whole picture. Cheadle is especially outstanding in a truly likable 
turn.
Aside from being a rapturous beauty with a definite skill at line-reading, a 
very-much-pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones (1999's "Entrapment") unearths 
herself as a stirring actress, bringing a palpable grittiness and poignance 
to her portrayal of a woman who finds herself in the most dire of 
circumstances, and will do anything under her will to save her gradually 
deteriorating family life. 
In the most effective of the subplots, Michael Douglas (2000's "Wonder Boys") 
underplays to ultimate perfection his role as Robert Wakefield, a man 
passionate about making a difference concerning today's drug problems, yet 
too naive and focused on his work to realize he has an addict living within 
the walls of his own house. Lending fine support in one of the strongest 
minor roles, Amy Irving (1976's "Carrie") is quietly effective as Robert's 
lonely wife, Barbara, who blames herself when their daughter's life spins out 
of control. 
Finally, newcomer Erika Christensen, as Robert's teenage daughter, Caroline, 
makes an unforgettable debut with the most heartbreaking character in the 
film. In the early scenes, which show Caroline recreationally taking drugs 
with her pals from school, including Topher Grace (TV's "That '70s Show") and 
Majandra Delfino (TV's "Roswell"), there is an accuracy present that rarely 
is achieved in the world of film. The sequence where Caroline is first 
introduced to heroin, which is followed by a single tear dropping down her 
cheek as she exhales from freebasing for the first time, is one of the most 
haunting images I've ever seen depicted on film. Christensen, like 
Soderbergh's treatment of this portion of the film, injects Caroline with 
such a tragic, raw power that it is often almost too difficult to watch.
Director Soderbergh has made his share of fine films in the past, not the 
least of being his acclaimed 1989 breakthrough, "Sex, Lies & Videotape," but 
"Traffic" is the very first of his efforts that could easily be considered a 
masterpiece. Always involving, always intelligent, and never coy about its 
high aspirations, Soderbergh wants each viewer to take something a little 
different away from the film, not necessarily caring what that one thing 
might be as long as he's sure it won't soon be forgotten. A grand 
entertainment, "Traffic" is one of the best Hollywood productions to come out 
of the pipeline in years, and its final statement is one of unshakable and 
disturbing finality. The drug culture in the United States, states 
Soderbergh, is a war that can most certainly be fought, but one that is never 
likely to be won.

"Traffic" has the good fortune of going into wide release after receiving 
Golden Globe nominations and numerous critical top-ten list postings.  
Without much competition, it will probably do well at the Oscars, but despite 
good intentions and some impressive moments, "Traffic" fails to achieve its 
goals.
Rather than centering on a central protagonist, "Traffic" weaves together 
three major storylines:  a) Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes 
the new drug czar while his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) becomes a 
drug addict; b) Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) 
pursues the Tijuana drug cartel and becomes allied with General Arturo 
Salazar (Tomas Milian), who seeks the same goal for his own reasons; and c) 
DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) watch 
Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) after arresting her drug-dealing husband 
(Steven Bauer).  Director Steven Soderbergh lacks the grace of Robert Altman, 
but he manages to keep all three storylines running simultaneously without 
losing the audience.
The primary reason "Traffic" doesn't fully succeed is that it wants to be 
several different movies:  a thought-provoking indictment of the failed "war 
on drugs," a portrait of addiction, and a gripping crime drama.  Perhaps a 
more talented director than Soderbergh might have been able to pull off this 
triple threat, but "Traffic" only manages to partially fulfill its goals.  
The critique of the methods and ideology of the drug war is spotty and often 
awkward (particularly when minor characters suddenly launch into speeches on 
subjects like the effect of NAFTA on drug traffic).  There's only one drug 
addict in the movie, which seems odd for an issue-driven film on the Drug 
Problem, and that one is unsympathetic.  Caroline Wakefield comes off as a 
spoiled brat, and her descent from prep school honor student to junkie whore 
doesn't elicit the pathos it should.  Erika Christensen does nothing to 
humanize her character.
Its strongest area is the crime drama vein with the parallel stories of 
Mexican and American cops who pursue the same cartel from different ends of 
the supply chain.  Especially compelling is Javier's plight.  An honest cop 
working within a corrupt system, Javier walks a winding and dangerous road 
paved with compromises.  Benicio Del Toro gives a remarkable performance.  A 
film like this tests the ability of an actor to develop his character with 
limited screen time.  Del Toro communicates more with a pensive look than 
most actors can with a soliloquy.
Also passing with high marks:  Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas.  I'm pleased 
that after so many wonderful supporting performances, Cheadle has gotten 
name-above-the-title recognition with this film.  He has great chemistry with 
Guzman (who deserves some recognition of his own).  I expected Robert 
Wakefield to be a heavy, but Douglas makes us feel the concern Robert has for 
his daughter.  
In contrast, the challenge of her first substantial role proves that 
Catherine Zeta-Jones has no acting ability whatsoever.  Her character has to 
go from being a high society wife whose world is overturned to a cop-killing 
drug dealer.  However, Zeta-Jones' performance shows no internal conflict or 
transformation.  She could be one of the worst actors in Hollywood.
In case you haven't guessed, I'm not a Soderbergh fan.  Ever since he came on 
the scene with "sex, lies, and videotape" in 1989, I've dismissed him as 
pretentious hack.  He's the valedictorian of the "Look at me, I'm an auteur" 
school of filmmaking.  (His classmates include Spike Lee and Oliver Stone).  
This style is characterized by an oppressive directorial presence that often 
undercuts the effectiveness of the film.  In "Traffic," Soderbergh joins the 
current trend toward monochromatic tints.  Douglas' scenes often have a blue 
tint while Del Toro's are yellow and grainy.  Luckily the power of those 
actors performances is not impeded by the distraction, but the heavily 
stylized approach seems a poor choice for a film that aspires to realism.
For those who like to play It's Ol' What's His Name, the supporting cast 
includes Dennis Quaid, Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace (from "That 70's Show"), 
Amy Irving. Peter Riegert, Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, James 
Brolin, and several real-life senators (including Orrin Hatch, who does not 
read from "The Exorcist").
Bottom Line:  Doesn't deserve most of the Oscars it will win

How do you fight a war when the people that you love are the enemy? 
When the conflict is in your own neighborhood, or your own house?  Such
is the dilemma in the exceptional new film about the drug trade in the
United States and Mexico, Traffic.
A harrowing and thought-provoking film, Traffic revolves around three
intertwining stories of cops, thugs, victims, enforcers, politicians,
and the judicial system.  The film is based on a British Channel 4
miniseries called Traffik, which traced a drug route from Pakistan
through Europe and to Great Britain.  Laura Bickford, one of the
producers for Traffic, was attracted to the original miniseries because
of the intersecting stories, the social commentary on drug usage, and
the implication of The System itself being the major perpetrator of drug
addiction.
The film revolves around three disparate stories, which Soderbergh
handles with aplomb.  One story centers on Tijuana State policeman
Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his partner, Manolo, caught in a
web of political corruption centered on the Mexican drug trade.  Del
Toro is a standout, delivering a subtle, powerful performance rich with
authenticity.
A second story centers on Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the U.S.
President's newly appointed drug czar whose daughter Caroline (played by
newcomer Erika Christensen), an A+ student, develops a drug problem that
turns from occasional use to severe addiction.  This story focuses on
the impact of drugs on the nuclear family and the general inability of
the family to protect itself.  Douglas and Amy Irving (as Wakefield's
wife) turn in wonderful performances as quiet, concerned parents who are
powerless to stop their daughter's fall into drug use.
Finally, the third story revolves around the actual purveyors of drugs
and the law enforcers determined to put them out of business.  The story
is anchored by Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), wife of major San
Diego drug baron Carlos (Steven Bauer). Unaware of her husband's illicit
business, she enlists the aid of her husband's attorney Arnie Metzger
(Dennis Quaid playing a slime ball) to get him out of jail -- even if it
means taking over the business.
Soderbergh's deft directing and cinematography work give each section of
the film a unique look and feel.  The Mexican landscape is overexposed
and enriched with sepia tones.  The home of Douglas and the government
agencies are a cool-blue color in sharp contrast.  San Diego has a warm
glow to its environment and its population.  Whenever characters from
each of the stories intersect, things get really spicy.
Traffic tackles tough situations and still delivers a solid, complex
tale filled with thrilling moments and heart-wrenching drama.  The film
doesn't deliver a solution for ending the war on drugs, but it does
offer insight into the business.  As a tale about the most
self-destructive part of society, Soderbergh has created nothing short
of a masterpiece.

After Stephen Soderbergh transformed an environmentalist struggle into a
sexploitative star vehicle for Julia Roberts, it should not surprise us
that he would Hollywood-ize the hard-hitting television miniseries
"Traffik". Made for Channel 4 in Great Britain in 1989, "Traffik" also
appeared on public television in the United States one year later. 
In "Traffic" Soderbergh has appropriated (or misappropriated) some core
elements of the original, while leaving out others that would get in the
way of his commercial goals. The resultant mess helps us understand how
liberal taste-makers frame the "war on drugs" in the face of an impending
war in Colombia. Considering that Soderbergh's first film was titled "Sex,
Lies and Videotape", an appropriate subtitle for "Traffic" might be "Drugs,
Lies and Hollywood".
In "Traffik", we are afforded a multi-tiered view of Great Britain's war on
the heroin trade. The central figure is a British Home Office minister
named Jack Lithgow (Bill Paterson) who has been assigned to oversee that
war. The irony, and one of the key dramatic elements of the tale, is that
his daughter is a drug addict. While relentlessly pursuing the source of
the "traffik" in Pakistan, he is constantly being pulled into his
daughter's own maelstrom.
"Traffik" derives its German title from the fact that one of the
politician's main antagonists is a German who uses a construction business
as a front for a much more lucrative heroin import business. After he is
arrested in the course of a major drug interdiction effort, his wife takes
over--even though she has been innocent of his activities up to that point.
Her easy slide into criminality serves to illustrate the point that nobody
is immune from the enormous temptations of a quick profit. Not only does
she assume control without missing a beat, she seems even more savvy than
her jailed husband. She announces, ''I'm going to be strong about this. I'm
not going to let go of everything we fought for'', as if the family
business was commercial real estate.
In Soderbergh's film the terrain and the commodity have shifted. We are now
dealing with the cocaine trade and its source is Mexico. The main character
is an American drug czar Robert Wakefield, played by the ubiquitous Michael
Douglas. His daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is a cocaine free-baser
who turns to prostitution to pay for her habit. In a search for his
daughter, which has all the hyped-up intensity of a Charles Bronson revenge
melodrama, Wakefield descends into the Black community, which takes on the
character of the Casbah. Blacks on the street appear menacing to Wakefield
(and the largely white audience I saw the film with), as if each had a
knife in one pocket and a drug stash in the other.
Another significant difference between the two films is how each drug czar
relates to the rogue third world country where the drugs originate. In
"Traffik", Lithgow is directing a campaign to wean Pakistani farmers away
from growing opium toward legal cash crops. His idealistic hopes are
eventually crushed when he realizes that there is no incentive for peasants
to stop growing opium. Unfortunately nothing grows in the arid Pakistani
soil as well as the poppy. "It doesn't need much water," Lithgow is told.
"It doesn't need much in the way of nutrients. They are just weeds -- the
richest weeds in the world." He learns that farmers must grow and harvest
10 acres of sugar cane to reap the profit from just three acres of poppies. 
Perhaps the heroin and cocaine trade is driven by the same brute economic
facts that drive the tobacco industry, a legal but much more toxic
industry. According to the book "Barbarians at the Gate," investor Warren
Buffett told Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund in 1987: "I'll tell you why I
like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a
dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty.''
While "Traffik" is mostly about character development--particularly
Lithgow's disillusionment--"Traffic" is mostly a lurid 'policier', a sort
of big budget version of the old TV show "Miami Vice", in which law
enforcement becomes paramount, despite the film's lip-service to the
obvious truth that the war on drugs is unwinnable.
In Soderbergh's film, the major point of view in Mexico belongs to Javier
Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), an honest cop out to bust the
corrupt Army general and the drug lords he protects. This Mexico is even
more wicked than the Black community, at least in cinematographic terms.
Soderbergh, who handled the camera itself for the Mexico location, uses a
sulfur-yellow filter to make sure that the audience understands that this
is a hellish place.
While "Traffik" takes place largely in Pakistan, where the opium is grown,
there is no interest in finding out what conditions spawn the growth of
coca. For that to take place, the film would have to include Colombia as a
venue. If you restrict your terrain to Mexico, you are dealing solely with
the finished product. And who else handles the finished product but
case-hardened businessmen rather than people at the bottom, who rely on the
soil to make a living.
This is where "Traffik" excels. The film begins with Fazal (Jamal Shah), an
impoverished Pakistani farmer who grows opium poppies on his farm and ekes
out barely enough money to support his wife and two children. Lithgow
eventually meets Fazal and asks, "Do you know that people in the West are
dying from the heroin you make?" "Sir, I grow opium, not heroin," Fazal
replies. "You deal with the heroin problem."
Soderbergh is quite open about his desire to flatter law enforcement
agencies in the USA, while simultaneously maintaining a hip "war on drugs
can not succeed" 'tude. In a profile that appears in the Jan. 3-9 Village
Voice, Soderbergh states:
"I didn't want to come off like we had answers. The idea that some silly
filmmaker after two years could sort it out would be outrageous. But there
seems to be a huge vacuum in the public debate and I guess this is one of
the few times I felt a movie could actually help. The funny thing is,
everybody who sees it thinks it puts their point of view across, and I was
expecting exactly the opposite. We had a screening in Washington for
Customs, DEA, and the Department of Justice and they all came out saying
they really liked it. The following night, there was some hardcore leftie
NPR/PBS [!!!!] screening in L.A. and some guy stands up and goes, 'Thank
you for making the first pro-legalization movie.' Then the other night,
Commissioner Safir came to a screening and said he thought it was the most
accurate representation of law enforcement he'd seen in a long time. And I
have, you know, stoner friends who are going, like, 'Dude, yeah, great . .
. '"
Nobody could possibly accuse Soderbergh of coming off like he had answers.
But one might have hoped that he would have had a more open-eyed view of
the cops in the United States, who appear in the film to be the Mexican
police's only reliable ally.
Since Soderbergh is based in Los Angeles, one can only conclude that he has
not been reading a newspaper for the past few years. Otherwise, he would
have felt the need to introduce a little bit of reality into his script,
based on the gargantuan Ramparts Division scandal.
It turns out that over the past decade or so, the LAPD anti-drug division
has been deeply involved in the cocaine trade itself. Ex-cop, now serving a
long prison sentence, Rafael Perez was accused of murdering, dealers during
a botched drug deal in the mid-1990s. His ex-girl friend claims that the
bodies of those victims and that of another woman allegedly killed by
Perez's partner David Mack were buried in Mexico in hopes that, if they
were discovered, they would be presumed to be victims of the region's drug
wars. While some investigators claim that this accusation was false, there
is no doubt that Perez and other officers have been found guilty of
stealing drugs from the evidence room of their department and re-selling
them on the street. In 1999 Perez pleaded guilty to stealing eight pounds
of cocaine in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. He also agreed to
identify other allegedly corrupt officers. Now this would have made for a
more interesting film, since it is a far more accurate representation of
how urban police departments behave--or misbehave.
Furthermore, if Soderbergh had been more informed about the relationship
between the USA and Mexico, he would have not been so eager to put white
hats on all the American officials, especially in light of the revelations
made by Thomas A. Constantine, the top drug-enforcement official who
resigned last year.
In an interview with the NY Times on November 26, 1999, Constantine states
regarding the Mexican drug trade: "I watched that situation for five and a
half years, and every year it became worse. We were not adequately
protecting the citizens of the United States from these organized-crime
figures."
"Every time we had a major case involving a criminal organization from
Mexico operating in the United States, there was a significant allegation
of corruption involving the Mexican Attorney General's office, a Mexican
state police force, the highway police," he said.
However, the Clinton administration chose not to confront the Mexican
government, since American concerns about Mexico's corruption and
drug-trafficking problems were secondary to trade and other economic
interests. 
"The idea was, if you said those things publicly, if you release documents,
you will just aggravate the situation," he said. "My concern was that we
had kids in this country dropping like flies. Maybe that was parochial, but
I felt like I was the only person there who felt like that." 
Even after Constantine's counterpart in Mexico was found in 1997 to have
been colluding with the country's biggest cocaine trafficker, serious
discussion of the issue within the Clinton administration was minimal, even
negligible, he said. The exception was the annual debate over whether to
certify the anti-drug efforts of Mexico and other nations that produce or
ship illegal drugs. 
Constantine told the NY Times, "Everyone would say, 'Your facts are
correct, but there are bigger policy issues involved.' "

Something disturbing happened on my way out of `Traffic'. After viewing a two
and a half-hour film on the various sides of the drug war in America, many
fellow audience patrons immediately took out a cigarette and began to smoke
away. That this heavy film, wrought with message and style, had absolutely no
impact on them is beyond comprehension. It seems Steven Soderbergh has created a
work of true questions and limited answers. It's a challenging piece that does
what Spike Lee did to racism in `Bamboozled', only this time the focus is drugs.
However poignant, people think these issues don't apply to them, but they do in
far too many ways.
Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is about to become America's new drug czar,
unbeknownst to his teenage daughter's drug addiction. Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez
(Benicio Del Toro) is a good-hearted Tijuana cop, seemingly the only one not
accepting backroom bribes. Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) husband Carlos
is on trial for smuggling illegal drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. Two
police officers in a van (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) are monitoring her every
move. This covers about half of the intricate stories held together by the ever
character-growing script that centers on the competition between two Tijuana
cartels. It's like a trapeze act on tightropes with the performers in clown
makeup juggling bowling pins that are on fire. There's a chance of falling every
second, but just a few minutes with Steven Soderbergh will eliminate all doubts
of plummeting to the three-ring ground. As anyone who saw his 1999 film `The
Limey' could tell you, holding up multiple characters through complicated time
changes is what Soderbergh does best, and it's what makes him a sensational
filmmaker. 
With it's length and tough subject matter, `Traffic' does get a little
depressing, but it seems a desired effect. The cinematography, one of the
highest standpoints of the film, creates a world of suffering through simple
filters. Each segment with a character is either in morbid blue, bleak yellow,
or limited color. This helps to create a gritty feeling that heightens to the
end. It nearly becomes nonfiction in style.
What's so great about `Traffic' is the acting and casting. Besides the
aforementioned actors, the cast also includes Dennis Quaid, Erika Christensen,
Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace, Amy Irving, Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, and
Majandra Delfino, to name a few. This is easily the year's best-assembled group
of actors. Soderbergh discovers things about each one of his players, and allows
them freedom to experiment with their talents. Just one performance is off key,
that being Dennis Quaid's turn as a conniving `friend' of Carlos and Helena. The
womanizing role fits him, but for some reason, there's no energy to his work. 
With ensemble pictures such as these, the question is normally, `Who's going to
get nominated?' There's only one easy answer, Benicio Del Toro. This underused
actor, who just jumpstarted his career with two other thematically related gang
movies `The Way of the Gun' and `Snatch', is beyond perfection. His mostly
Spanish-speaking role aches with the lifelong difficulties of his character.
Beyond him, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, who by the way share no
screentime together, have the best chance. 
Though better off a statement than a movie, `Traffic' certainly raises questions
that haven't appeared before now. It feels like a documentary, but it also feels
like an elaborate, fanciful fairytale. As if this only applies to a small number
of people near the border, or that the drug war won't take decades to fight. It
will take decades, and it will apply to everyone. `Traffic' is the perfect
icebreaker and introduction to these issues that have no apparent solution or
end.
And another cigarette is lit. And another joint is smoked.

"Traffic" is a kaleidoscopic look at the famous War on
Drugs.  Melancholy in tone, the film presents a
scathing indictment about America's inability to
adequately counter the proliferation of narcotics and
its woeful aftermath.  From the most affluent,
civic-minded members of our society to the most
reprehensible base, this multi-layered story looks at
how the influence of the drug trade destroys or
corrupts all that it touches.
The most poignant and ironic among the interwoven
storylines is that of federal judge Robert Wakefield
(Michael Douglas) who has just been appointed to be
the newest drug czar.  He's passionate about his job
and genuine in his desire to curb the smuggling
operation of the Mexican cartels.  He meets important
people (various Senators make cameo appearances) and
takes a trip to the El Paso Drug Enforcement
Administration Headquarters to closely examine
government interdiction strategies.  Yet, while he
believes that his trip to the Mexican border puts him
on the front line, he practically never realizes that
the problem has already hit tellingly close to home. 
This suggests that America is losing the war, and this
theme rears itself constantly in all of the scenarios
presented.
It's not just America that has to contend with the
drug problem.  Even Mexican officials take great
interest in it.  However, with the high level of
corruption within the government, it's not necessarily
clear whether these officials are trying to squelch
the supply of drugs or are trying to monopolize it. 
In its most complex storyline, Tijuana cop Javier
Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) must tread carefully
after he is recruited by an army general to help
squash one of the cartels.  He soon learns, though,
that he is in a battlefield where it's never clear who
his enemies or his allies are.
A third storyline is more conventional, but no less
biting about the futility of stemming narcotics
trafficking.  Two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis
Guzman) catch a drug mob underling (Miguel Ferrer)
whom they turn to testify against his powerful boss. 
The snitch banters philosophically that the agents'
efforts will only be a waste of taxpayers money while
competing cartels will only become more powerful.  As
with the other two scenarios, it's all very solemn
stuff as the good guys struggle to fight a war in
which hope seems to be constantly smothered by the
effects of the white powder.
"Traffic" boasts strong performances by the ensemble
all-star cast (especially Del Toro).  It also benefits
from a directional style that helps to make this
otherwise complex story easy to follow.  Of note is
the use of its visualizations that help to
differentiate the stories currently happening
onscreen.  The Mexican world, for example, is somewhat
blurry and is shot using pale yellows to bring out the
squalor of that environment while the Washington elite
is shot with regal colors and is in focus to denote a
world of protocol and order.  However, be warned if
your goal is to find entertainment.  This is an
issue-driven film with a pronounced documentary feel. 
It might even seem like some revved up program that
you might see on The Learning Channel.  Therefore,
while many of the scenes will be intense enough to
capture your interest, the film's lack of drama may
turn you away.  But no matter what you eventually
think, the material will undoubtedly raise a few
eyebrows.

TRAFFIC, by director and cinematographer Steven Soderbergh (ERIN 
BROCKOVICH and OUT OF SIGHT), is an intriguing and cautionary tale of 
human duality (good/evil, honest/corrupt, confident/desperate, 
powerful/hopeless, rich/poor, etc.) set against the background of drug 
trafficking and usage.
Using the canonical metaphor of a "war" against drugs, the script by 
Stephen Gaghan (RULES OF ENGAGEMENT) is loosely based on Simon Moore's 
television miniseries, "Traffik," which was shown many years back on 
PBS.  (For the record, I found the movie similar in tone and quality to 
the miniseries, even if the two tell different stories.)  Unlike 
traditional warfare, the drug war has no real beginning or ending and 
few publicized heroes.  If there is an analogy to be made, the drug war 
is like the endless trench battles in World War I.
The ambitious TRAFFIC is constructed of 3 parallel and overlapping 
stories.  The highest profile one concerns Ohio Supreme Court Justice 
Robert Lewis (Michael Douglas), his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), and 
their 16-year-old daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen).  This is a 
dysfunctional family with their own internecine warfare.  Robert is 
bored.  Barbara is in denial.  And Caroline is generally stoned from 
freebasing, snorting and shooting up with her wealthy friends and with 
her low-rent drug dealers.  "I'm really angry," Caroline (Erika 
Christensen) tells her AA group.  "I'm angry about a lot of stuff.  I'm 
just not sure what."
Incongruously, Robert is about to become the nation's next drug czar.  
After learning of his daughter's habit, he approaches his upcoming job 
with a vengeance, but his call for "out of the box" thinking from his 
lieutenants generates dead silence.  The root cause of the unlimited 
demand for drugs is probably best summarized by one of Caroline's fellow 
AA members who calls alcoholism and drug addiction, "allergies of the 
body and obsessions of the mind."
In San Diego, undercover DEA agents Monty Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray 
Castro (Luis Guzman), are trying to trap mid-level trafficker Eddie Ruiz 
(Miguel Ferrer).  "In Mexico, law enforcement is an entrepreneurial 
activity," Eddie brags about how easy it is to pay off those on the 
other side of the border.  He is a cynic who likes to taunt the police.  
"Your life is pointless," Eddie reasons with Monty, since incarcerating 
some drug dealers just means that someone else will sell users the drugs 
that they want to get high.  Eddie views drugs as inevitable, so why 
shouldn't he be the one to prosper from their sale?  Steven Bauer plays 
Eddie's boss, Carlos Ayala, and Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Carlos's 
pregnant wife, Helena.  Helena's all too rapid arc from good to bad is 
one of the story's few disappointments.
In Mexico, low-level policeman Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), who 
makes the princely sum of $316 a month, and his partner, Manolo Sanchez 
(Jacob Vargas), go to work for Mexico's chief drug official, General 
Salazar (Tomas Milian).  Like their American counterparts, they are 
trying to work their way up the food chain to the top members of their 
nation's distribution network, in their case, the Tijuana cartel.  
General Salazar's men, however, have more powerful tools of their trade, 
with torture and murder being two of their more dramatic ones.
The film's large cast, which also includes Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, 
Dennis Quaid and Peter Riegert, are well utilized.  One almost feels 
sorry for those actors whom Soderbergh didn't invite to be in his film.
The movie is surprisingly slow paced for its subject matter and in need 
of another editing pass to trim off some of the fat.  The story itself 
is fascinating with the notable exception of the unconvincing action of 
one character towards the end, which plays like a cheap bit of 
moralizing by the screenwriter.  
All of the above notwithstanding, what the viewers are most likely to 
remember a year later is the film's imaginative cinematography.  Mexico 
is filmed in warm yellows and browns, reflecting the land's heat and 
poverty.  A cool blue, like blue suits reflected off of marble columns, 
is used for the seats of power in government.  And bright primary, like 
from an expensive decorating magazine, are used for the settings of the 
wealthy.  Even before the characters speak, Soderbergh's color scheme 
alone has already told us much about them.
TRAFFIC runs too long at 2:27.  It is rated R for pervasive drug 
content, strong language, violence and some sexuality and would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.

 Traffic (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Michael Douglas, Don
Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis
Quaid, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving, Erika Christensen, Steven Bauer and
Benjamin Bratt.  Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan. Directed by Stephen
Soderbergh. Rated R. Running tim: 147 minutes.
  Traffic is a depressing, documentary-style drama that sadly depicts
the futility of this nationís efforts in the drug war.
 Using an omnibus, storytelling technique, director Steven Soderbergh
intermixes the lives of an Ohio state supreme court justice (Michael
Douglas) nominated to become the countryís newest drug czar; a Mexican
police officer (Benicio Del Toro) trying to end the epidemic of drugs in
his country; two undercover U.S. narcotics detectives (Don Cheadle and
Luis Guzman) who are working to help convict a big-time drug dealer; and
a pregnant wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who does what is necessary to
survive after learning her husband has been arrested for disturbing
narcotics.
 Traffic is not a movie the DEA will use as a recruitment tool. The
movie shows law enforcement officials as mostly ineffectual, undermanned
and outgunned.
 And while the film does not glamorize the various drug dealers, sellers
and users, it does portray them as more adept at skirting the law and
beating the judicial system than their honest foes.
 With a screenplay by Stephen Gaghan, Traffic is a grim examination of a
problem that seems to be getting worse, despite what government
officials or the nightly news tell us.
 And much to their credit, Gaghan and Soderbergh portray the drug world
as a big business, a corporate community distributing a product that
just happens to be illegal. They take no moral stand, but they do convey
the ugliness of the userís universe, the dangers of the dealersí domain
and the rampant double crosses that is par for the course among the
various distributors.
 The temptation of easy money that can turn an honest copís outlook and
make him look the other way also is touched upon.
 Nowhere is this made clearer than in the episode involving Del Toro,
who must team up with one drug cartel in order to eliminate another. His
price, a baseball field for the youngsters of his town so they can have
a place to go at night, thus keeping them off the streets and away from
the various dealers who prey on children.
 The weakest episode involves Douglas as the drug czar nominee. As he
travels about the country learning of the extent of the drug problem, he
is faced with a personal crisis after discovering that his teen-age
daughter is an addict.
 This seems too pat, too melodramatic a plot contrivance, even though it
allows Gaghan and Soderbergh to examine the problem at a level on which
many moviegoers can relate.
 With the aid of cinematographer Peter Andrews, Soderbergh has given
Traffic a you-are-there quality as if watching a TV documentary. This is
especially true of the scenes shot in Mexico, which are bathed in a
golden hue and have an improvised air to them. It also helps that the
actors speak Spanish and the filmmakers use subtitles.
 Adding to the realism are many sequences that appear shot with
hand-held cameras.
 The performances are superb throughout, especially Douglas as the
nominee, who confidence is slowly eroded as he observes the problem from
afar as well as from within his own household.
 Del Toro is outstanding as the conflicted drug cop who wants to
eradicate the trade from his country.
 Cheadle and Guzman are strong as the front-line grunts who risk their
lives to keep the poison off the streets.
 Most notable is Zeta-Jones as a decent woman who must resort to
extremes to save her husband, her family and her home. Hers is the most
disturbing story and she instills a moral ambiguity in her performance
that is most troubling.
 Traffic is one of the best films of 2000, a grim and pessimistic
exploration of an insidious menace that can touch any household not only
in this country, but anywhere in the world.

What a year 2000 has been for director Steven Soderbergh. After
releasing "Out of Sight" and "The Limey" in 1999 to great critical
acclaim, but little attention from filmgoers, the 37-year-old hit two
out of the ballpark in 2000, beginning the year with "Erin Brokovich"
and wrapping it up with "Traffic," a rich, multi-layered look at the
illegal drug industry, based on a five hour 1989 British miniseries.
Soderbergh tackles a lot with this bold, uncompromising project and
pulls it off in grand fashion, with only a few missteps along the way.
To his credit, Soderbergh never gets on the soapbox about the American
government's highly trumpeted, controversial "War on Drugs." "We were
trying to personalize all of it, on both sides of the issue," he told
USA Today. "Nobody in law enforcement will look at you with a straight
face and say, 'We are winning the war on drugs.' And that's really all
that we're laying out."
The film shifts between four storylines, using various color tints and
film stocks for the different scenarios. It begins with bleached out
sepia tones in Tijuana, where local cops Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del
Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) intercept a large cocaine
transaction in the desert, only to have General Salazar (Tomas Milian)
and his troops swoop in and take the stash.
Cut to upscale America and blue hues as Ohio State Supreme Court Justice
Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) prepares to become our country's new
drug czar. What the judge doesn't know is that his 16-year-old daughter,
Caroline (Erika Christensen), has just been introduced to the joys of
freebasing.
Bold colors and raw stock dominate as we shift to Southern California,
where DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) conduct a sting on mid-level dealer, Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel
Ferrer), hoping to force him to turn informant.
Meanwhile, pregnant and glowing Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones)
glides regally through the upper crust life, unaware that her husband,
Carlos (Steven Bauer) is the drug kingpin being sought by the agents for
supplying Ruiz and many, many others.
Soderbergh juggles the storylines with grace and style, using hand-held
cameras and well-chosen jump cuts to maintain a sense of immediacy.
Although the film features a whopping 130 speaking parts, keeping track
of the participants is not difficult.
Because of his reputation as an actor's director, Soderbergh has no
trouble landing talent and this production features his most dazzling
roster yet. Down to the smallest part, the casting is impeccable, with a
number of standouts. "Boogie Nights" veterans Don Cheadle and Luis
Guzman make a great team, with Cheadle's buttery voice and bright
demeanor contrasting neatly with Guzman's gritty tones and bulldog
nature. Miguel Ferrer, who consistently stole scenes in "Twin Peaks" as
Albert, the deliciously caustic FBI agent, bristles with desperate
indignation while radiating a feral sexuality as a dealer backed into a
corner. As usual, Catherine Zeta-Jones simmers with a potent combination
of intelligence and unnerving serenity. Best of all is Benicio Del Toro,
whose weathered face and deep, soulful eyes mesh perfectly with his
tired, but unstoppable character. Often cast as a villain, Del Toro is
far more effective as a hero.
The movie has some problem areas, most springing from Stephen Gaghan's
script. The transformation of Zeta-Jone's character once she learns the
truth about her husband is needlessly abrupt; an extra scene depicting
her struggling with the revelation might have smoothed things out.
Michael Douglas' character would also have benefited from some
additional shading. Initially, he comes off as anemic and tentative.
Later, when he goes to rescue his daughter, he appears overly
reminiscent of Charles Bronson in "Death Wish," with periodic echoes of
his own attack mode persona in "Falling Down."
But the shakiest portions of the film deal with security measures,
specifically those involving a car bomb and an assassin out to make a
hit. Revealing the details would spoil a couple of scenes, so I'll
simply say this: If you ever become famous, DO NOT hire these officers
as bodyguards.
Some critics have faulted "Traffic" for wrapping its storylines
ineffectually, but I disagree. The conclusions presented simply reflect
what happens in the real world when lives become immersed in drugs. Some
people live, while others die. Some users keep using, while others go
into recovery and try to hang on. Some dealers flourish, while others
eventually get caught. The bottom line remains the same: The government
will continue their war, however ill-conceived, but they will not win,
because too many of us are driven to self-medicate and, as long as there
is a market, the dealers will find a way.

Featuring well over one hundred speaking parts over the course of a
running time that just misses the two-and-a-half-hour mark, Steven
Soderbergh's sprawling drama _Traffic_ is indeed jam-packed, but never
does it reach a stall.  This saga of the so-called "war" on drugs is a
masterwork of superb performance, smart writing--and, most of all, the
mark of a director who not only knows what he wants, but also exactly how
to make his ambitious vision a glorious reality.
Unlike most multicharacter pastiches, such as the ones made by Robert
Altman, or Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_, the characters of
_Traffic_'s three tales don't constantly crisscross, nor are they all
brought together by a big event.  Intersections are rare in _Traffic_,
and the junctions that do occur are often fleeting.  Yet the stories are
strongly linked by their greater thematic concern: to vividly illustrate
how the drug problem touches all corners of the country, all walks of
life, from people on the harsh urban streets to those in lavish
upper-class neighborhoods.  Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan, working
from the '80s British miniseries _Traffik_, steadfastly refuse to force
easy, comforting conclusions from difficult and complex situations; as in
real life, one is left to decide for oneself who or what is right, and
what it all means.
While _Traffic_ is essentially about the war on drugs in America, the
film's starting point is the almost-exclusively south-of-the-border (and
nearly all Spanish language) story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro,
doing away with his annoying tics and delivering a career performance),
an average Tijuana State policeman who is given the opportunity for
greater prestige by working for General Salazar's (Tomas Milian) efforts
against the drug cartels.  Just north of the border in San Diego is the
setting for another thread, in which very pregnant European émigré Helena
Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones, her real-life condition adding a deeper
layer to her role) learns that the pampered lifestyle provided by husband
Carlos (Steven Bauer) comes from dabblings in drugs, not legit business
ventures.  The film also travels a bit northwest to Cincinnati, the third
central locale, where Caroline (Erika Christensen), the teenage daughter
of newly-appointed U.S. drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas),
brings her father's enemy much closer to home than he could have ever
imagined.
Soderbergh effortlessly weaves the individual strands into a tapestry
that is at once cohesive and characterized by its contrasting colors. 
The latter can be taken in a literal sense--Soderbergh, under the
pseudonym "Peter Andrews" (his father's name), shot the film himself, and
he gave each part of the film its own distinct look: grainy, washed-out
yellow for Mexico; a solemn blue sheen for Cincinnati; sun-drenched full
color for San Diego.  Each, of course, is representative of the
prevailing mood: the arid amorality of the drug underworld; the sad
desperation of daughter and father; the sparkle of a too-good-to-be-true
standard of living.  The intimacy and realism of the characters and their
situations, aided immeasurably by Soderbergh's hand-held
documentary-style lensing, smooth out any possible seams between the
pieces.
_Traffic_ may sound like a grim exercise in arty pretense, but the
weightiness of the subject matter doesn't necessarily keep the film from
being an accessible entertainment.  This element is largely satisfied in
San Diego, where Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman make a crack seriocomic team
as FBI agents surveilling the Ayala home and protecting a key witness
(Miguel Ferrer); this thread also delivers its share of unpredictable
twists.  The other two sections are by their very basic premises--power
struggles between drug lords and overmatched law enforcement, teen
substance abuse--darker and hence less open to offering more standard
genre satisfactions, but the performances make them instantly absorbing.
It is easy, almost too easy, to peg _Traffic_ as merely being a
statement on the futility of the war on drugs.  Yes, once boiled down to
the bare essentials, that is what the stories are about; yet the film's
essence are its painfully, truthfully imperfect people, who show how
everyone, knowingly or not, in some way becomes a casualty and a
perpetuator of the war machine.  With its wide focus, Soderbergh's film
is technically epic in scale, yet _Traffic_ derives its lasting power
from the savvy notion that sheer size is no match for urgent,
true-to-life immediacy.

Traffic   * * * * out of * * * *  
Starring: Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Catherine 
Zeta-Jones, Erika Christensen, Luis Guzman, Jacob Vargas, Dennis Quaid, Amy 
Irving, Topher Grace, Miguel Ferrer, Steven Bauer, James Brolin, Benjamin 
Bratt, Tomas Milian, Albert Finney.
Directed by: Steven Soderbergh
Rated R: strong drug content, violence, language, sexuality, some nudity.
Running Time: 147 minutes
Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" is so good, that I don't think any word in my 
mouth could describe the perfectness of this film. In the style of 
"Nashville" or "Magnolia," "Traffic" is based on a miniseries that played on 
BBC in 1989. The gritty content, and the shaky camerawork will definitely 
turn off some viewers, but for the others, they will walk out of "Traffic" 
with their mind working overtime, thinking about what they just saw.
The film consists of different plots, each their own, and each brilliant and 
insightful, the first has Javier Rodriguez (Benecio Del Toro) and Manola 
Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), two cops out to bust a cocaine smugglers in Tijuana. 
After the plan is unsuccessful thanks to the General, they are hired to find 
an assassin who is linked to a wealthy drug dealer Carlos Ayala (Steven 
Bauer).
In the second plot, drug dealer Carlos Ayala is arrested by federal agents in 
front of his wife Helena (Catherine-Zeta Jones) and their child David. After 
her son is threatened by someone linked to the business, Helena who is six 
months pregnant with their second child, is forced to find $3 million 
dollars, to keep their son's life safe, and theirs as well. In an attempt to 
save their lives, Helena becomes the caretaker of her husband's business.
Michael Douglas is Ohio Supreme Court Justice Robert Wakefield the newly 
appointed Drug Czar for Washington, DC. Trying to crackdown on the drug war, 
his daughter Caroline (newcomer Erika Christensen) is a drug addict herself, 
and along with her boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace off "That 70's Show) tries to 
keep this habit a secret from her father.
DEA Agents Ray Castro and Montel Gordon, who's key witness in the case 
against Carlos Ayala, the two must keep an eye out on Helena, and her home. 
Not knowing she has taken over her husbands drug dealing business. The two 
here seem to keep the film's comic relief alive, and somewhat moderate 
throughout the film.
Steven Soderbergh has created an American Masterpiece, and there is so much 
going on in this film, that after it was over I was ready to watch it again 
to see if I missed anything. After his successful year last year with "Erin 
Brockovich" which to me was on par with this film, his talent continues to 
show, especially in this film. His use of different colors for each story is 
pure brilliance, and complete originality, the use of the camera, the 
graininess throughout the film, and the style to which he directs his 
fantastic.
The cast is another story all together, every single person in this movie is 
amazing in their own way, to start Michael Douglas gives one of his best 
performances to date and he graces the screen and shows that he is a true 
actor. As his daughter newcomer Erika Christensen is realistic and true to 
her role, as the tormented teen. Amy Irving has not been seen on the screen 
for a while, but she proves she is a great actress, and her performance is 
almost heartbreaking. Catherine-Zeta Jones gives her best performance, after 
her dreary performance in 1999's "The Haunting", she comes back with force 
and shows to be a beautiful, wonderful actress. Dennis Quaid although not 
seen throughout the film that much, gives a good performance, but to me isn't 
given enough to do. 
Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are equally great in their roles, and they 
provide wonderful comic relief for the audience, and for the movie as well. 
Their chemistry onscreen is natural, and two seem to be having fun with their 
roles. Possibly the best performance in the film comes from Benicio Del Toro, 
who after last year's flop "The Way of the Gun" gives an absolute excellent 
performance, his eye movements, his body movements, his dialogue and the way 
it comes out of his mouth, this is my pick for the best male performance of 
2000.
The brilliantly written script by Stephen Gaghan is expertly crafted, 
beautifully thought out, and the dialogue is great as well. Stephen 
Soderbergh's "Traffic" to me can rank up there with mosaic's such as 
"Nashville" and "Magnolia", its study of the character's and their lives is 
that of nothing ever seen before. Prepare for Traffic, its going to be heavy 
today. One of the best, and most powerful films of 2000.

What a script! Sincere, detailed, gritty dialogue runs its street-real 
mouth all over this richly woven story. 
"Traffic" attacks the "The War Against Drugs" from multiple angles: The 
Mexican beat cop, the S. Californian detective, the higher level Mexican 
drug lord, the American drug lord's wife, the newly appointed 
commissioner on drug control in the States and his coke-snorting 
daughter. 
Filmed in an "off the tripod" documentary style, the look and feel of 
the film reminds me of "Three Kings." A burnt-out orange filter is used 
during the many south of the border sequences. It's an effective tool to 
"heat up" the tension of these scenes as well as assist the viewer to 
distinguish locales. Though tension building, the shakey camera bit 
grows a tad tiresome. 
I particularly enjoyed the intelligent, even classy, snitch; the 
repartee between US Detectives; the sweet ending shot; the Mexican cop - 
sort of a cross between a Latin Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe; and of 
course the masterful interweaving of many tasty subplots. 
Unfortunately one flaw, which in another film might be glossed over, in 
this otherwise intelligent production stands out like a footprint in a 
perfectly spread concrete patio. Sadly, that one breakfast scene spoiled 
my appetite for this meticulously prepared meal.

   What should be done about the problem of illegal drugs in
the U.S.?  Should our country deal with the supply side or the
demand aspect?  If the former, should we increase the
funding for the border patrol?  Give money to governments of
countries which are known to supply large amounts of drugs
so that they can fight the problem better on their own?  If the
latter, should we increase our education program?  Jail
suppliers and throw away the keys?  These are solutions
proposed in the past.  Are we winning the drug war?  No one
on any side of the political spectrum thinks so.  Millions upon
millions of Americans make a market for the product. 
According to Steven Soderbergh's challenging new film,
"Traffic," twenty-five percent of high-school kids are doing
drugs, and the situation today is different from the way it was
during the late 60's and 70's.  Young people are not casually
"experimenting" any more and the drugs are more plentiful
and purer than they ever were.  How do you cope with
numbers like that when the bad guys have more money to 
keep the stuff flowing into our country and into our citizens'
veins than our government can afford to halt the torrent?
   Utilizing a screenplay by Stephen Gaghan (who scripted
William Friedkin's"Rules of Engagement" but here eschews
a crazed scenario that focussed on a Marine officer who
"wastes" a throng of Arab demonstrators), Soderbergh makes
ample use of hand-held cameras to build an edgy but highly
intelligent police thriller.  Giving the two and one-half hour
drama the same docu-drama feel that he furnished to his first
movie, "sex, lies and videotape" (about a selfish lawyer
whose wife has turned frigid, whose sister-in-law is his lover,
and whose college friend comes up for a visit), Soderbergh
shucks that story's Eric-Rohmer style talkiness for the sort of
energy inherent in his February blockbuster, "Erin
Brockovich."
   "Traffic," whose hand-held cinematography by Peter
Andrews (a pseudonym for Soderbergh himself) gives the
picture a frighteningly real texture, embraces enough twists to
convince us that in this ongoing war on drugs, things are
seldom what they seem.  Twist follows curves, as Soderbergh
plunges us into three separate stories.  Unlike Robert Altman,
he does not ultimately unify his tales but nonetheless shows
how a narrative dealing with drug lords in Mexico meshes
with a yarn about a family's attempts to deal with their
daughter's addiction, which then plaits with the story of a
criminal who turns coat and prepares to testify against a
major U.S. kingpin.  Despite the docu-drama feel of the
movie, "Traffic" actually evokes the thrills of John
Frankenheimer's "The French Connection."
   Michael Douglas, now looking more like his dad than ever
before, could be called the center of the three stories.  In the
role of Robert Wakefield, a conservative justice on the Ohio
Supreme Court who has just been appointed by the president
to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, the handsome
actor symbolizes the cynicism that the so-called war on drugs
elicits in people of all political stripes.  Opening as a naive,
gung-ho fighter who expects to make a real dent in drug
traffic, he is bureaucratically restrained by the president's
staff, which cautions Wakefield to hold no press conferences
for several weeks and to deliver no speeches to the media
unless cleared by the the administration.  Convinced that he
will learn nothing if he remains in the Beltway like so many
other politicians, he travels to the Mexican border at San
Ysidro, consulting  with Mexican authorities and later with top
officials of the FBI and other organizations.  Naive to a fault,
he is unaware that his own 16-year-old daughter, Caroline
(Erika Christensen), is a heroin addict--a fact known for
months by his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving).
   In a second undertaking, police officers Montel Gordon
(played stirringly by Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) are determined to keep drug trafficker Eduardo Ruiz
(Miguel Ferrer) alive, at least long enough to testify against
multi-millionarie kingpin Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer).  Ayala's
beautiful wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), naive in her
way as Wakefield is in his, is unaware that her husband's
money comes from the drug trade.  The change that comes
over her after the arrest of her husband mirrors the
transformation of Wakefield upon learning of his young
daughter's habit.
   However the most gripping part of the picture centers on
Mexican police officer Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro),
an honest Tijuana cop who sees no problem accepting a
meager salary of under $400 a month but who at the risk of
his life is forced to become enmeshed in the rampant
corruption now an actual part of his country's system.  (As
the voluminous press notes indicate, some Mexicans have
been moving into the same position that criminals in
Colombia have relished, providing a huge share of illegal
substances smuggled partly through the 28-lane highway that
leads from Tijuana to San Diego.)
   Like many other filmmakers, Steven Soderbergh wants his
films to be enjoyable to his audience.  Entertainment is
primary.  He wants the bulk of his audience to come to the
theater for the roller-coaster ride but to leave not only
diverted from their daily cares but also encouraged to think
about the deeper issues posed by the films.  "Erin
Brockovich" would likely be the example he would trot out: a
story bolstered by Julia Roberts's over-the-top performance in
the title role of a poor, undereducated mother.  Her
determination to fight a major polluter not only inspires the
viewers but gets them to contemplate similar unscrupulous
activities by large corporations in their own areas of the
country.  
   While accounts of the drug trade are a daily staple in
newspapers and TV reports, they do not give the public the
kind of dramatic wholeness that a film like "Traffic" can
produce.  Soderbergh shows us the desperation that faces
responsible people in the U.S. who cannot understand the
great appeal drugs have for people across all walks of life. In
one scene, Wakefield flies to Washington with a group of
advisers, high-ranking officials of the FBI, the DEA and
others, asking them to think out of the box--to come up with
avenues of action perhaps never contemplated before.  What
he gets, essentially, is silence--his fellow travelers looking
blankly at this drug czar as if asking for a solution to the
problem confirms that he is looney.
   While "Traffic" is in no way as stylized as the slicker "Erin
Brockovich"--after all the story is filmed completely with hand-
held cameras and a hefty dose of improvised dialogue--no
one can fail to notice the effect of Soderbergh's use of color. 
To separate the mosaic, making clear to everyone which of
the three stories is being projected at any given time, he
divides the film into distinct hues, particularly tobacco-brown
for the gritty areas of Mexico and executive blue for the
opulent areas of the U.S. (the tony Cincinnati suburb of Hyde
Park, for example). This is overkill.  A more conventional use
of filters would have done the job without creating this
unnecessary set of distractions. For added authenticity he
has the Mexicans speak Spanish to one another (with English
subtitles), has cast a number of Latinos, and even uses the
actual director for the U.S. Customs service in San Diego,
Rudy R. Camacho, to play himself.  This is sound. Like Lars
von Trier and other followers of the Dogme 95 theory, he
uses natural light wherever possible, and artificial illumination
when needed to add some clarity to the cheap hotels and
crack dens--which differ exquisitely with the upper-middle
class suburbs or Cincinnati. The country clubs of San Diego
seem a different world from the seedy streets of Tijuana just
a couple of miles down the road, and in fact any traveler to
San Diego is bound to note the bold contrast between the
yacht-filled waters of southern California and the teeming
slums of Tijuana just over the fence.
   While the principal performers, particularly Benicio del
Toro, dramatize their roles expertly, the supporting players
are indispensable to the film's authentic feel.  Tomas Milian is
an almost inscrutable General Salazar, the highest-ranking
police official in Tijuana whose desire to crush the cartel of
one Juan Obregon seems so excessive that we wonder about
his true motivation.  Clifton Collins Jr. does an impressive
turn as a slightly-built hired assassin for a cartel, called in for
a job by a rich woman whose charity work belies her dark
nature.  As Robert Wakefield, Michael Douglas gives us
further reason to believe that a person can change radically
during the course of a drama.  If a wealthy woman, a pillar of
her community, can become an assassin; if a thoroughly
honest cop can become debauched against a lifetime of
evidence that contradicts the transformation; if a conservative
judge can shuck his $1500 suits, symbolically displaying his
newly acquired wisdom that outside appearances mask
tenebrous interiors--then who knows?  Maybe next year
Americans will stop freebasing, snorting, drinking, smoking,
carousing and gorging!

When conservative Judge Robert Wakefield is asked to lead the President's war
against drugs, he takes the job seriously even as his predecessor (James
Brolin) gives him edgy advice.  From this springboard, director Steven 
Soderbergh takes us on a journey that stops at every link in the drug chain,
from Mexican state cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro, "The Way of the
Gun") to corrupt Mexican General Salazar, to Californian distributor
Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer, "Primal Fear"), his fingerer Eduardo Ruiz
(Miguel Ferrer, "Robocop") and money launderer Artie Metzger (Dennis Quaid)
and the NARCs that tail them, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle, "Boogie Nights")
and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman).  The circle is closed with the drug user,
Wakefield's sixteen year old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen, "Leave It to 
Beaver") in "Traffic."
Adapted by Simon Moore from the 1989 British miniseries "Traffik" (by Stephen
Gaghan), "Traffic" presents a mosaic of the drug trade as something as 
inevitable as human greed.  Soderbergh gives his audience a lot to think about 
with this powerful film, while also delivering an entertaining crime thriller.
"Traffic's" 'good guys' are represented at opposite ends of the pole by
Douglas' ineffectual drug czar and Del Toro's melancholy Mexican cop.  As
Judge Wakefield makes the political rounds, Rodriguez encounters General 
Salazar (Tomas Milian) at a remote drug bust and gets pulled into the nuts 
and bolts of fighting the Tijuana cartel while trying to keep his partner 
Manolo (Jacob Vargas) from taking the low road.  
In San Diego, Gordon and Castro nab Ruiz who leads them to Ayala, one of the 
big guys.  Ayala's wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is left in a financial 
predicament, discovering her husband's indebtedness to viscious drug lords
is jeopardizing their young son's life as well as her cushy lifestyle.
A hit man known as Francisco Flores/Frankie Flowers (Clifton Collins, Jr.)
is used in both countries.  Wakefield's chilly home life (wife Barbara (Amy 
Irving), a former drug using hippie, is the liberal to his conservative) is 
contrasted against Caroline's hanging with the philosophical cool crowd that 
leads her to heroin and inner city slums.
The story is fascinating, peopled with compelling characters.  Soderbergh
and his editor Stephen Mirrione bring an urgency to this film that makes
its 135 minute running time race by.  Acting as his own cinematographer,
Soderbergh visually separates the Mexican action from its corresponding
events in the U.S. by shooting in a sun baked golden hue that prisms into
a myriad of colors in monied San Diego before chilling to blue when shifting 
to the Ohio location of the Wakefield household.
"Traffic" showcases the best ensemble cast of the year.  Douglas
seems so much more right for Judge Wakefield than Harrison Ford,
who walked away from the role.  Douglas is believable as a righteous man
who takes on the world only to find he can only take on his own family.
It's Del Toro, though, who most fully encompasses the circular nature of
the beast.  He seems to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, yet
has the humor to give over to the battles not worth fighting.  Caught between
a rock and a hard place, he can speak volumes just staring off into space.  
Surprisingly good is Zeta-Jones, who takes her character down very unexpected 
paths and has the chops to do it convincingly.   Cheadle and Ferrer interact to
represent the middle layer, with cool Ruiz expressing disgust that Gordon
will continue to fight drugs while never making progress.  Topher Grace of TV's
'That 70's Show' makes a strong impression as Caroline's boyfriend Seth,
the pied piper of bored, privileged teenagers.  The cast also includes cameos
by Albert Finney as the President's Chief of Staff, Salma Hayek as a drug
lord's mistress, Peter Reigert as the Ayalas' lawyer and James Brolin as
Wakefield's wry predecessor.  Playing themselves are former Massachusetts 
Governor William Weld and Iowa's Senator Chuck Grassley.
Soderbergh has had a boffo auteur year, first with the mainstream favorite
"Erin Brockovich," now with "Traffic," the best American movie of the year.

     In most films about drugs or drug addicts, drugs themselves are an
almost supernatural presence. Even the very good ones tend to turn
addiction into a monster, something that stalks and consumes the people in
the film -- a THC-laced Blob, or a Needle from the Black Lagoon. They may
play with moral ambiguity, but ultimately they come down to a horror film
mano a mano: Either the monkey kills the hero, or the hero kills the
monkey.
     In Steven Soderbergh's elusively gripping TRAFFIC, drugs are not a
monster; they're not even the villain. Drugs become a character, crafted
with more complexity and nuance than the human characters in most films.
The broad canvas explores multiple perspectives on that strange entity
called "the war on drugs." In Washington D.C., Ohio judge Robert Wakefield
(Michael Douglas) prepares to become the United States' new "drug czar."
Back in Cincinnati, Wakefield's daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen)
herself becomes part of the demand side of the problem. In San Diego,
upper class housewife Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) finds her world
thrown into turmoil when her husband (Steven Bauer) is accused of being a
drug lord, while a pair of Federal agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman)
protect the star witness (Miguel Ferrer). And in Mexico, casually corrupt
local police officer Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) gets involved in
some far-less-casual corruption.
     Based on a BBC mini-series, TRAFFIC sets up an ambitious scope that
proves absolutely critical to its effectiveness. Every character in the
film is in some way complicit in making the drug trade the violent beast
it is, from the blatantly unconcerned Mexican officials, to the wealthy
white teenagers whose pretentious expressions of existential despair
ignore the real-world implications of their drug use. Zeta-Jones' Helena
is initially sympathetic in her shock over discovering her husband's
secret life, then a darker figure once concern for preserving her
comfortable life overwhelms all other concerns. Perhaps most challenging
of all, TRAFFIC asks what can be accomplished by a generation of Americans
who continue to push publicly for anti-drug efforts while remaining
ambivalent about the danger of the drugs that many of them used themselves
in their youth. Steven Gaghan's script never once offers either a pat
condemnation of anti-drug efforts or a simplistic demonization of the
substances themselves. It's a rich, deeply thought-provoking piece of
work.
     It's not half-bad as pure film-making either. Soderbergh has become a
master of incorporating stylistic innovation into relatively mainstream
fare, and he scores again here. The scenes set in Mexico are given a
grainy, saturated look that make the whole country look like it's
suffering from a case of heat-stroke; there's a sharp, sudden contrast
with an early courtroom scene shot in an icy blue. TRAFFIC often has an
almost improvisational edge to it, and virtually every scene and
performance feels kinetic and urgent. This is a film full of scenes that
grab you without a hint of melodrama, full of background characters (Peter
Riegert as Ayala's smug attorney, "That '70s Show's" Topher Grace as
Caroline's cocky boyfriend) that burst to vibrant life. And that's saying
nothing of at least one foreground character (Benicio Del Toro's
conflicted cop) so splendidly performed that his scenes seem like part of
a documentary.
     TRAFFIC only hits speed bumps when the sheer density of the narrative
becomes a hindrance. The script occasionally resorts to making speeches to
make its points -- with Ferrer's mid-level dealer in particular uttering
"you can't stop us" taunts to law enforcement -- as though afraid the
points already made by the arc of the story would be lost in the shuffle.
Some of the key characters feel vaguely under-developed, and there are a
couple of late scenes and plot developments that feel forced into an
already dense tale, giving TRAFFIC the sense of being over-loaded during
its third act. It's still an awfully good third act, one that wraps up an
even better movie with the perfect combination of harsh reality and
genuinely satisfying optimism. I'm not sure you could say TRAFFIC ever
takes a side on its difficult subject, unless it's the side that small,
personal victories can still make a losing battle worth fighting. That's a
refreshingly mature take on a subject that usually comes down to killing
monsters.

Is it me or does director Steven Soderbergh have something akin to a great track record? From "Sex, Lies and Videotape" to "Schizopolis" to "The Limey" to two fairly good Hollywood productions, "Erin Brockovich" and now "Traffic," the latter two released the same year. And "Traffic" is not merely good, serviceable Hollywood entertainment, it is damn near great. 
Soderbergh's "Traffic" is concerned with drug trafficking in America and in Mexico, and how the war on drugs from the top has outlived its purpose. Michael Douglas is Robert Wakefield, a Supreme Court justice becoming the newly appointed drug czar of America (an unfilled position in Mexico), who is taking steps to prevent this drug war from continuing. His ideas, however, are met with a cool reception from his staff. Why? Because the war on drugs is a fruitless one accompanied by far too many dangerous parameters - economic is one such factor of any such parameters. Wakefield eventually meets with General Salazar (Tomas Milian), who resides in Tijuana and appoints a clever border cop, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) to raise ire among the cocaine cartels. The questions is: does Salazar have something else in mind or does he really want to bust them and torture them? Is he as concerned about the manufacturing and exporting of cocaine as Del Toro is, or for that ma!
!
tter, the righteous Wakefield?
"Traffic" shifts from different characters and locales throughout, and gradually we see how others are affected by this chain of command in the U.S. and Tijuana. There is the drug lord, Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), who is arrested and sent to jail, leaving his pregnant wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to fend for his illegitimate business, something she was not aware of. We also see Caroline (Erika Christensen), a top-notch high school student who innocently becomes a sleepy-eyed cocaine addict - she also turns out to be Wakefield's daughter. Then there are the undercover DEA agents (Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman) who bicker and joke, even when arresting a mid-level trafficker, Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) - the job of the dual agents is to protect Ruiz who is likely to be rubbed out. This, of course, would allow the release of Ayala from jail. 
"Traffic" is at its most tantalizing when dealing with Del Toro's moral conflict of speaking out on the corruption in his own country, or of keeping his mouth shut in the face of inevitable tragedy. The Tijuana scenes are the most powerful, evoking the futility of drug warfare where no end is seen in sight. Del Toro realizes this, thus being a rat or staying loyal essentially makes no difference. He can only save his own skin.
This is also true of Wakefield's own job, which is put into question when he discovers his daughter's addiction. Wakefield himself is not a happy man, living a life of boredom as he calls it with his family and seeking an exit with alcohol. This upsets his wife (Amy Irving), but their relationship is really put to the test with their daughter's problems and the fact that she becomes a runaway. How can Wakefield save the country from drug warfare if he can't even save his own daughter?
Speaking of aesthetics for the time being, "Traffic" temporarily annoyed me with its visual look. As shot by Soderbergh himself, he uses filters for the sepia-drenched scenes in Tijuana and the cool blue colors of Washington, D.C. but these scenes stand out at first for being far too obvious. Just remember what notable cinematographer Nestor Almendros once said about filters: "Any movie that I see that uses filters, I shut off after five minutes because it is too easy." He may have had a point, but admittedly, once the film is on course and speeds along its multi-based narrative, I found the filtering less and less annoying. I still feel I should not have to be reminded where I am - Tijuana, by all accounts, is certainly different from Washington, D.C. A minor quibble.
Soderbergh's real strengths are with actors, and he has quite a stupendous cast on hand to work with. Del Toro is at his most blazingly understated ever, challenging us and keeping us guessing at every moment as to what his thoughts are in contrast with his actions. He is so unpredictable, funny, tense, dramatic, and emotional that it remains the most dynamic role I've seen in all of 2000. 
Major kudos also go to Zeta-Jones playing a charming housewife, also challenged by the lies from her husband and his business, and it is alarming to see the shift in her character from paranoid to ruthless (still, there is a missing transitional scene or two showing this transformation). Michael Douglas (who shares no scenes with his wife, Zeta-Jones) does his damnedest playing a man pressured by everyone from up above, yet showing a tender, sympathetic side when confronted with familial problems. 
Also noteworthy are Cheadle and Guzman performing their bickering byplay as if leftovers from a Paul Thomas Anderson flick, and they are so engaging and entertaining that it is hard to forget them. They seem to come from a mediocre action picture but their personalities infuse their characters with humor and sublime restraint. I love the scenes they share with Ferrer, who sees himself as an average businessman and reminds Cheadle that the DEA's job is not only fruitless but it also helps the drug trade. After all, if Ferrer has to pack up and go to jail, someone else can always take over. 
"Traffic," based on a 1989 British miniseries of the same title, is not an original crime epic but its treatment of an ongoing problem in America is breathlessly and magnificently executed by the wondrous Steven Soderbergh. Despite a lack of real insight into some of the characters, the film will leave you with a knowledge of how drugs are big business in this country and how many would like to keep it that way. All we can do is protect and nurture our own families from this increasingly hopeless and, yes, fruitless problem.

The world of international drug trafficking is a high stakes and high-risk
world where billions of dollars can be made pandering to the addictions of
American society. Steven Soderbergh's latest work, "Traffic," explores that
world and its players while showing the tragic results of addiction on the
family.
Soderbergh, since his radical debut in 1989 with "sex, lies and video
tape," has marched to his own filmmaking drummer and, though not always
successful ("Kafka"), has always been interesting. He not only proves to be
innovative, he can also wow the movie-going public with mainstream stuff,
too ("Erin Brockovitch"). On the heels of the latter film, Soderbergh could
have rested on his laurels but, instead, hits us with one of the best films
released in 2000.
The huge ensemble cast is wonderfully utilized to tell the several
different stories that inexorably intertwine and come together in the end.
Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) works the border around
Tijuana with his friend and partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) under
Mexico's numero uno crime fighter, General Salazar (Tomas Milian). Their
job is to destroy the powerful Obregon drug cartel that is funneling
billions of dollars of illicit narcotics into the US.
Across the border, pretty housewife, Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones),
is shocked to learn that her businessman husband Carl (Steven Bauer) was
arrested for drug trafficking. Her greatest fear in life, that she be left
a "debt-ridden 30-year old mother of two," is about to be realized if she
can't figure a way out. She is in hock to the cartel for millions and her
life threatened, forcing the innocent women to become a ruthless
businesswoman in her own right as survival, then greed, take over.
Michael Douglas is Ohio Supreme Court Justice Robert Wakefield, a
conservative, anti-drug advocate recruited by the President to become the
new US drug czar. While Wakefield throws himself into learning all he can
about drug smuggling, his teenage daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen),
is a willing participant in the drug culture her father is tasked to
destroy. For Caroline, it is a steady downward spiral as she, first,
experiments with cocaine and freebase, then gives herself over sexually for
the intoxicating numbness of heroin.
Undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) rep the US involvement in the War on Drugs as they work overtime to
build their own case against the Obregon drug cartel. They bust mid-level
drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Mel Ferrer) and cut a deal to get him to testify
against Helena's husband. From here, the stories take on a further
complexity as the inexorably intertwine.
Soderbergh musters the best ensemble performance of the year from this big
cast that is also supplemented with a plethora of cameo perfs that flesh
out the complexly crafted tale. Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro give
Oscar-worthy performances as Judge Wakefield and honest cop Rodriguez. The
beauty about these and other perfs in the film is the depth the actors get
to plumb with their characters. Without a great deal of screen time, each
actor develops his or her role into multi-dimensional people. This is a
combination of fine acting and a deft hand by the helmer.
Catherine Zeta-Jones is cast in the less than glamorous role of a
protective mom. The pretty actress is given a character, in Helena, which
arcs across the screen. The confused, scared wife and mother is not someone
to be taken lightly as she learns of the extent of her financial burden. As
Helena takes control of her destiny, we see a frightening ruthlessness
develop. When she orders, "I want the principal witness against my husband
killed," she knows what she is doing and what she wants. It's the first
film where Zeta-Jones isn't just a pretty face and she acquits herself
well.
Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman ably man the action north of the border in
their own quest to bring down Juan Obregon. They have the more meat and
potatoes story as they catch, then turn state's witness, trafficker Ruiz.
This part of the tale is reminiscent of Steve McQueen's "Bullitt" as the
two cops struggle to keep their ward alive long enough to testify.
There are, as I said, lots of cameos and small roles with the likes of
James Brolin, Peter Riegert and Albert Finney showing up. Dennis Quaid is a
prominent background character as Helena's attorney and advisor. Amy Irving
is effective as the judge's wife, Barbara.
Tech credits are the best. Photography, by Soderbergh himself, is striking
as it changes from crisp, colder images when north of the border to soft,
sepia tones when south. The rest of the techs are just as notable. Stephen
Gaghan's script is as remarkable as the rest of the efforts on this film,
weaving a complex tale that loses none of its threads.
Steven Soderbergh gives a double whammy this year and could have simply
rode on the popular coattails of "Erin Brockovitch" and its star Julia
Roberts. Instead, he produced one of the best, if not the best, American
films of year 2000. I give "Traffic" an A.

It's really too bad that most people will think of Traffic as `that film
with Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.'  While it's true that
the presence of the newlyweds could help the film in terms of its take
at the box office, it would be wrong to dismiss Traffic as a novelty
thrown on the screen simply to please Americans in search of new royalty
to worship (which is what Douglas and Zeta-Jones have become now that
all the good Kennedys are dead).  Besides, they never appear in one
scene together.
You wouldn't call American Beauty `that movie where Kevin Spacey jerks
off in the shower' or refer to Citizen Kane as `the thing with the guy
and the sled,' so don't do the same to Traffic.  And, yes  Traffic is
good enough to mention with films like Beauty and Kane.  It's also the
fourth film Steven Soderbergh has directed in less than three years (and
third in just over one year)  a pretty amazing feat, considering that
those films are four of the best that have been released over that same
period (Out of Sight, The Limey and Erin Brockovich).
Traffic comes at you with both barrels blazing (there aren't even any
opening credits to get in the way).  Within fifteen minutes, you'll be
introduced to about a dozen major characters as you're whisked along to
six different settings.  The film bounces between three different,
unrelated storylines that all have to do with drugs.
In Tijuana, Mexico, two state police officers  Javier Rodriguez
(Benicio Del Toro, The Way of the Gun) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas,
Next Friday)  find themselves in the middle of a drug war between the
Obregón and Madrigal families.  Both men are honest (as much as a
Mexican cop can be) and are legitimately interested in stopping the flow
of drugs from Mexico to the United States.  Javier and Manolo even begin
taking orders from the shifty General Salazar (Tomas Milian, The Yards),
who also seems intent on fighting the war against drugs.
The second thread takes place in Cincinnati, Ohio, where State Supreme
Court Justice Robert Lewis (Douglas, Wonder Boys) has just been
appointed by the President to head the Office of the National Drug
Control Policy.  The country's new anti-drug czar doesn't have a clue
that his own daughter (Erika Christensen) freebases smack with her
prep-school classmate (Topher Grace, That 70s Show).
The final storyline takes place in and around San Diego, where a
big-fish dealer (Miguel Ferrer, Lateline) has just been busted by two
federal agents  Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle, Mission to Mars) and Ray
Castro (Luis Guzmán, OZ)  and turned over his bigger-fish boss in
exchange for immunity.  The boss (Steven Bauer, Primal Fear) is dragged
off to prison, while his pregnant wife (Zeta-Jones, Entrapment) tries to
deal with the surprise of finding out that her husband wasn't really in
the construction business after all.
Soderbergh, who also photographed the film (under the pseudonym Peter
Andrews), shot each of the three stories as differently as the U.S. and
Mexico handle the war on drugs (one country has meetings about the drug
problem, while the other breaks the law to combat it).  The Tijuana
story (which contains dialogue mostly in Spanish) is grainy, gritty and
dark, while the American threads are bright and glossy.  Most of Traffic
was filmed with Soderbergh wielding his own handheld camera, which gave
the film a more realistic look and enabled him to pull terrific
performances from each and every actor, some of whom may be competing
against other Soderbergh-directed actors (from Erin Brockovich) when the
award season rolls around.
It would be tough to pick a favorite story from Traffic, as each is done
so well and has unique elements to enjoy.  I loved the washed-out, Three
Kings look of the Tijuana story and thought that Del Toro gave the
film's best performance.  Newcomer Christensen was amazing as the
drugged-out National Merit finalist with a high-profile father (a la
Magnolia), and it was fun to see Zeta-Jones work her real-life pregnancy
into the part and to use her Welsh accent in a film for the first time.
The most enjoyable part of Traffic was realizing that there were no
heroes or clearly defined good guys to root for.
Like his other films, Soderbergh uses a wide variety of music in Traffic
 from Fatboy Slim to Brian Eno's haunting `An Ending (Ascent)' which
closes the film.  The score, written by Soderbergh regular Cliff
Martinez, was performed by (among others) Michael Brook, Herbie Hancock
and Flea (who is billed as `Master of the 4-String Electric Bassius
O'Phellius').  Traffic was filmed on location in Washington, D.C.,
Cincinnati, El Paso, Mexico, San Diego and even used one of the sets
from The West Wing.
Traffic was written by Rules of Engagement's Stephen Gaghan, who has
also penned episodes of The Practice and NYPD Blue.  His script was
adapted from a popular British television miniseries (called Traffik),
which starred Julia Ormond and focused on a drug route that flowed from
Pakistan to England.  The film has one of the largest casts I've ever
seen, including an unbilled performance from Salma Hayek and appearances
by several U.S. Senators, including Barbara Boxer and Orrin Hatch.

A big, loopy, overlong, dullish docudrama-style thriller, about the
losing battle of the 'War on Drugs.' It is at times more preachy than
dramatic, taking the point of view that something has to be done about
the drug situation but not saying what, only that what's been tried has
not worked and the youth of America are being unduly harmed by drugs.
This film calls for a greater emphasis on treatment programs and on
mutual cooperation between the Mexican government and the DEA, and more
funds to support the effort against a criminal element that has more
money, resources, and better weapons than the good guys do. There's
nothing new presented here: same old answers, same old film, but this
one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the
formulaic way this story was adapted from a Simon Moore work, which was
scripted by Stephen Gaghan and directed with precision but in an
uninspiring way by Steven Soderbergh. It first ran as a mini-series on
British TV in 1989, a medium it probably would be the most logical place
to view this updated ambitious version. The film was devoid of real
emotion and played as if the new drug czar was on Larry King piously
expounding his beliefs and the drug lords, drug dealers, and drug
addicts, were not only slimes and disturbed people, but bores.
The film, to tell its story as coherently as possible (which it manages
to do), will criss-cross between southern California, different parts of
Mexico, the slums and the rich suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio, and
Washington, DC. The film center itself around conservative Ohio State
Supreme Court Justice Bob Wakefield (Michael Douglas), who will be the
new drug czar. At each location the characters change, and even though
they might never meet, they are connected by their interest in drugs,
either to use or sell, or by their efforts to put it off the streets.
The complex multistory will present an overview of the current drug
culture, as the drug czar's eyes will widen as he learns about the
extent of the problem he is facing. The film's three principal
storylines hope to pigeonhole the problem as seen from both sides of the
border of law enforcement and from the point of view of earnest law
enforcement officials and those who greedily traffic in drugs, and,
ultimately, from the direct impact it has on a white, upper-class,
suburban family.
The film opens as Tijuana-based cops Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro)
and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), halt a drug shipment on a desert road
but are then themselves stopped by army general Salazar (Tomas Milian),
who seizes the stash.
Bob Wakefield will learn soon after his appointment how vulnerable he is
to the drug problem, as his high achiever, sullen 16-year-old daughter,
Caroline (Erika Christensen), is getting into heavy drugs (free-basing
cocaine) with her creepy, preppie boyfriend (Topher Grace) and some of
her classmates, which comes to light after one of their acquaintances
overdoses and is brought to the hospital. Bob has lost touch with her by
being so busy at his work and his haggard wife (Amy Irving), an
experimental drug user herself as a college student, can't relate with
her. They are both lost at what to do, but he gets her into a Step
Program, involving group therapy as a treatment, but is relocated in the
Beltway and can't follow through on how her treatment is going.
DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman),
acting on a tip, are conducting a sting operation on San Diegobased,
middle-level dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer), whom they hope will
lead them to local drug kingpin Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), whose
pregnant haut monde wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), has been kept
ignorant of the real nature of her husband's business. After the
successful sting and the arrest of her husband, she turns out to be as
ruthless as he is and easily gets involved in trying to fix things so
that hubby gets out, even if it takes murdering the witness who is ready
to testify against him.
Once all the stories are in place, the film shows how human frailty
plays a part in the corruption of various individuals. Helena will do
anything to stay rich, as she hires a hit man (Clifton Collins Jr.) to
take care of Ruiz. Carlos's snakelike lawyer (Dennis Quaid), who tries
to steal three million dollars from his boss while he is behind bars,
realizes what will happen to him when found out, but still does it
because he craves what the drug kingpin has. Manolo succumbs to being
bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees
passing hands and does something he would never have done, if not
tempted.
The film wraps up neatly, tieing up all the tragic ongoing drug war
stories. There was no tension in the air when the drug czar delivers his
White House press conference address in a disbelieving tone about how
his office will issue a new "10- point plan" to fight drugs. Wakefield
has become too demoralized by what has happened to his family, and
realizes his words sound hollow, offering the public nothing new. So he
asks out loud, How can you wage a war against your own family? The film
soft pedals any advocacy for legalizing drugs and offers no hard-hitting
critique of current policies, except to say it doesn't work. It seems to
have safely placed itself in the middle of the argument, not taking
sides (a rather wishy-washy way to leave things).
I don't know what could be said, other than this was a competently made
film, the actors were forceful in their roles, with the plucky
performance by the conflicted cop Benicio Del Toro outshining the
others, and for some comic relief, there was some amusing dialogue
between Cheadle and Guzman. The film had a nice look to it, as
cinematographer Soderbergh aka Peter Andrews, has given the film a look
of urgency, using a handheld camera, and working with different
tinctures of desertlike yellow-orange shades and icy blue lighting to
get a better view of his subjects and their hard-boiled tale.

Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan, based on the
miniseries "Traffik" by Simon Moore. Starring Michael Douglas, Don
Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro. Running time: 147 minutes. Rated AA for
controversial subject matter and offensive language by the MFCB. Reviewed
on January 10th, 2001.
"Traffic" accomplishes a rare feat indeed. A movie about one of the most 
prevalent issues confronting modern society -- the drug trade -- it 
nonetheless manages to rise above simple proselytising and offers a 
brutally uncompromising, essentially unbiased perspective on its subject 
material. In a world where even the best dramas tend to take sides, this 
is remarkable; even more noteworthy is the fact that it happens within the 
confines of one of the most gripping films of the year.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh, and vastly superior to his crowd-pleasing 
but underachieving "Erin Brockovich", "Traffic" tells three stories about 
lives affected by drugs. These are tangentially connected, but mostly 
stand up on their own -- it would not be difficult to remove any of the 
plotlines from the movie and view those segments in isolation.
In one story arc, Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, an Ohio judge 
who has been named by the President to be the nation's new drug czar -- 
the nominal head of America's war on illegal substances. But unbeknownst 
to Wakefield or his wife Barbara (Amy Irving), their own daughter Caroline 
(Erika Christensen) has been lured into the drug culture.
Meanwhile, Douglas' real-life bride Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Helena 
Ayala, whose husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) is secretly one of the 
country's top importers of narcotics. This is revealed to Helena only when 
Carlos is arrested by Agents Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Castro (Luis Guzman) 
following the apprehension of a lower-level dealer (Miguel Ferrer). Helena 
is soon embroiled in Carlos' world when the cartel he worked with 
threatens their son's life to keep Carlos from betraying them to the 
authorities. The only help Helena can turn to seems scarcely preferable -- 
including Carlos' perfidious business partner (Dennis Quaid) and a cunning 
cartel head (Benjamin Bratt).
Finally, there is the tale of Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez 
(Benicio Del Toro), who fights against drug trafficking from his side of 
the border. Javier becomes caught in a war between two cartels (one of 
them Bratt's) and discovers that neither his partner (Jacob Vargas) nor 
the army general who professes to Mexico's biggest anti-drug crusader 
(Tomas Milian) are as dedicated to the task as they would have him 
believe.
Soderbergh's direction stands out in "Traffic". He employs a rigid, 
realistic style which thrusts the audience directly into the drama. Events 
unfold at a sometimes feverish pace, but Soderbergh keeps things lucid, 
often helped by focussing on a handful of very strong characters. He also 
distinguishes each of the three plotlines by filming each of them (or 
rather, each of their principle locations) in a different style. The 
Washington and Ohio locales of the Wakefield storyline look cold and blue, 
reflecting both the bureaucratic nature of the judge's new environment and 
the downward spiral which has gripped his family. The Mexico scenes, on 
the other hand, look hazy and washed out, as though the sunlight is
raining down on the desert and barrios. And the California locations for 
the Ayala segments are more lushly, naturally lit.
Each of the storylines boasts a number of fine performances. Douglas is on 
the mark as a man who is expected to serve a nation, but who finds he 
cannot even help his own flesh and blood. His desperation, as the 
pressures of his job conflict with his desire to heal his family, is 
effectively conveyed. Del Toro, meanwhile, is excellent as a little fish 
in the big and tumultuous pond that is Mexico, unable to completely trust 
anyone and often finding himself on the side of those whose actions seem 
no better than the criminals'. 
Zeta Jones is less successful as Helena, her character lacking consistency 
from scene to scene. To an extent, this is because the entire California 
subplot feels a little rushed. Unlike the other two storylines, which 
chiefly concentrate on just one character (Judge Wakefield and Javier 
Rodriguez, respectively), Helena competes for attention with other 
individuals, most notably the entertaining double act of Gordon and 
Castro. Indeed, Cheadle brings such intensity to his role that it seems a 
shame he does not feature more prominently in the film. There is a lot 
happening in the Ayala segments -- legal maneuvering, financial 
maneuvering, Helena's efforts to deal with Carlos' cohorts, the agents'
investigation -- and at times it feels rushed and jumbled. 
The same cannot be said of the superb Mexico scenes, which offer a 
blistering look at the blurred line between those who run the country and 
those who run the drugs. Here we see how easy it can be for a lawman to 
abandon his duty and turn the other cheek -- not only because it can be 
tantalisingly lucrative to do so, but because the deck already seems so 
overwhelmingly stacked against him.
The story of the Wakefield family is probably the most familiar and 
accessible to mainstream audiences, and the tale of a girl hooked on drugs 
and unwilling to commit herself to rehab is nothing new. But "Traffic" 
depicts this subplot with such stark honesty that it is far more effective 
than most treatments of the material. What happens to Caroline is horrible 
and sobering. The explanation offered by her boyfriend (Topher Grace, from 
"That '70s Show") for the stranglehold drugs have on the population is 
equally so.
"Traffic" reaches no conclusions, favours no sides. Some aspects of the 
film support the controversial notion of legalising narcotics, and suggest 
that the drug war is futile and doomed to failure. Others offer a spark of 
hope that, slowly but surely, America is winning this most insidious of 
battles. In the end, it is not clear that current policy is at all 
effective, but nor is it indisputably misguided -- the possibility for 
both exists.
What "Traffic" does accomplish is simply to raise the level of awareness 
of just how complex an issue this really is. Politicians and activists who 
attempt to dismiss or address the problem with glib words and handy 
catchphrases are neither helping nor, increasingly, fooling anybody.
