With more and more television shows having gay characters, and even the
infamous "Ellen" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian, the movie
industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines.
THE BIRDCAGE was critically acclaimed, as was this years CHASING AMY. Then
along came IN & OUT, and all three of these films are on my top ten list for
the years in which they were released. It's also noticeable that this
"alternative lifestyle" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by, and it
seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort. While it's
a very serious issue to many, it is the comedies that people are flocking to
see and that are gaining notoriety.
But the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite
dramatically. While the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to
laugh *at*, it is more and more becoming something we laugh *with*, and when a
movie like IN & OUT comes along, it is something that both heterosexuals and
homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy. It doesn't poke fun at the
lifestyle, it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity, just as love, sex,
marriage, birth, death, and anything else has been.
The idea for IN & OUT was born the day Tom Hanks won his Oscar for portraying
an AIDS-afflicted gay man in PHILADELPHIA. If you remember, during his
acceptance speech, Hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community,
and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his
life. It's a serious and touchy subject, but producer Scott Rudin viewed it as
the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy, and pitched it to screenwriter
Paul Rudnick. It's true that if this same film had been written by a
heterosexual, it may have been more controversial, but because it was written
by an openly gay writer, the prerogative was set.
Kevin Kline, who only seems to become more and more acclaimed, stars as Howard
Brackett, a high school English teacher in the small, picturesque town of
Greenleaf, Indiana. After a three-year engagement to fellow teacher Emily
Montgomery (Joan Cusack), a wedding date has been set, and the hubbub
surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story -
Greenleaf High graduate Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) is up for a Best Actor
Oscar. The small town eagerly awaits both events, and both seem quite
astronomical, but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other.
When Cameron Drake is announced the winner, the excitement is heightened as he
pays tribute to his high school English teacher, Mr. Brackett. Everyone is
cheering back in Greenleaf - that is until Cameron tacks on those three
calamitous words, "and he's gay." The town becomes silent as the entire
population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop. The thing is, nobody, including
Howard, can understand how Cameron came to that conclusion, and such wild and
unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative American haven
such as Greenleaf. Naturally the questions pour from Howard's fiancee, parents
(Debbie Reynolds & Wilford Brimley), students, and the high school's
principal, Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart), and the evidence starts to become more
and more obvious: Howard is clean, neat, honest, sincere, a romantic, and
perhaps the most incriminating fact, he loves Barbara Streisand.
The frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news
magazine and "Entertainment Tonight" wannabe show up at Greenleaf High the
very next morning. One particular reporter is Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck) of
"Inside Entertainment", who unlike the collage of other reporters, wants to
spend a whole week in the life of Howard Brackett, including coverage of his
wedding. The intrusion is all but welcome by Howard, who is going more and
more out of his mind with each passing minute. It seems that no matter where
he turns, a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding
homosexuality are being tossed to him like Frisbees.
The dominoes begin to tumble as Howard's closest friends begin acting
different and Principal Halliwell hints at a possible termination of
employment should Howard indeed be gay. It all sounds very devastating, and it
would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's
most delightful ensemble casts. Kline seems only to improve with age, and he
is downright perfect here. The great thing about this film is that every
single character has a moment to shine, and they use it wonderfully. Every
single actor turns in one of their best performances ever. Dillon has never
been so likeable, Cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role, and Brimley,
Reynolds, and Newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat.
Rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor, and you'll likely find
yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes. While IN & OUT doesn't
carry enough to give it four stars, it remains one of the best done films of
the year, all-around. The script is exuberant, the actors are absolutely top-
notch, and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to
bog down the laughs. It remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety, yet
we're still allowed a sappily touching ending.
Despite it's subject matter, and one scene that comes almost too close for
comfort on explaining gay sex, this is a movie that everyone could, and
should, enjoy. Frank Oz, best known as a voice talent for Muppets, directs
this film quite delightfully, using all the potential Rudnick's script has to
offer, which turns out to be quite a bit. Check this one out. You'll have a
gay old time.

Some movies are bettered remembered by their trailers. In & Out is almost
that kind of movie. The trailer for In & Out is hilarious and reveals a
large chunk of the movie. Can the movie itself stand up to the trailer?
Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is an English teacher in the small town of
Greenleaf, Indiana. He wears a goofy bow tie and loves Barbra Streisand. He
is getting married in a few days, this after being engaged to his fiancée,
Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), for three years. Howard's life is pretty
uneventful. That is until a former student, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon),
blurts out that Howard is gay during his Oscar acceptance speech. This puts
a big spin on Howard's life. In come the media, friends, and family asking
if Howard really is gay. Howard denies it at first, but then starts to
confront the issue. And both him and we are trying to figure out if he's
gay or not.
In & Out is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing hard at times, but,
there were some lulls. Kevin Kline is hilarious as Howard Brackett. He uses
some pretty amusing body language in his portrayal of Howard. As a student
tells him, "Watch the hand thing." As Howard tries to find out who he
really is, he tries a do-it-yourself package on exploring your manliness.
As he taps his feet and throws his arms in the air to start dancing the
tape tells him, "Truly manly men don't dance."
Tom Selleck is a gay reporter covering the news extravaganza, and he does a
good job with his somewhat limited role. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely
psychotic as Howard's mother.
The real star of In & Out is Joan Cusack as Howard's three-year fiancée
Emily. Cusack is the psychotic and unstable Emily who looks like she is
going to go nuts at any given moment. As psychotic and unstable as Emily
is, Cusack makes Emily very innocent, and willing to do anything for
Howard, including losing 75 pounds for the wedding.
Frank Oz has a great sense of comic timing and keeps the laughs rolling,
even up to half way through the credits. The macho man ending to the film
leaves the audience with a silly grin walking out the door. Though, the
ending events are somewhat contrived, but they work to make for a happy
ending.
Though I loved the trailers, the movie is not a letdown. In & Out has its
small flaws but in the end, the humor overshadows the flaws. In & Out is a
hilarious film that I highly recommend. This is a must see movie.

Paramount / 1:28 / 1997 / PG-13 
Cast: Kevin Kline; Joan Cusack; Tom Selleck; Debbie Reynolds; Wilford 
Brimley; Matt Dillon; Bob Newhart; Gregory Jbara 
Director: Frank Oz 
Screenplay: Paul Rudnick 
"The Birdcage," 1996's Mike Nichols-directed remake of "La Cage Aux 
Folles," must be considered as a landmark breakthrough for gay-themed 
films. For a type of film that is not generally known to be embraced by 
certain factions of the movie-going public, it earned both soaring 
audience word-of-mouth and cleaned up at the box office to the tune of 
$120 million. Now, about a year-and-a-half later, another step is being 
taken to get the genre into the mainstream with "In & Out," and although 
it's not as solid or polished as "The Birdcage," it's still an 
unequivocal success on all sides. 
The movie takes place in Greenleaf, Indiana, the kind of conservative, 
naive midwestern province whose marker boasts that it's "a great big 
small town." Prominent high school English teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin 
Kline) entertains his classes by telling students about past pupil 
Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a local hero who made it to Hollywood and is 
now the odds-on favorite to claim the Best Actor Oscar at the upcoming 
Academy Awards ceremony. Win Cameron does, and while accepting his award, 
he bestows his thanks upon Howard. Everything goes like clockwork until 
Cameron tacks on a two-word final thought to conclude his gratitude: 
"He's gay." 
The phrase is met with gasps by the residents of Greenleaf, all 
attentively staring at their television sets, their jaws on the floor. 
But no one is more shocked than Howard himself, who's viewing the
ceremony with fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack), his girlfriend of three years. 
His sexuality is immediately called into question, resulting in rather 
large problems for both his personal and private life. Complicating 
matters further is the presence of Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), an 
investigative journalist for "Inside Entertainment," a tabloid TV 
newsmagazine that decides Howard's on-the-air "outing" is a worthy story 
to follow. Also in a tizzy are his parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford
Brimley) -- who see his impending marriage as a birthright -- his 
principal (Bob Newhart) and a few of his male students, who begin to 
wonder if Howard's interest in them was ever something more than 
educational. 
"In & Out" is written by Paul Rudnick, an openly gay humorist who penned 
the script to "Addams Family Values" and has a monthly column in 
"Premiere" under the alter-ego of Libby Gelman-Waxner. His most recent 
project, an adaptation of his own hit play "Jeffery," was well-recieved 
by those who had the opportunity to see it but failed as the crossover it 
was likely intended to be. This project will probably make up for that -- 
because Rudnick doesn't confine himself to one hot-button issue, he 
playfully tweaks many of them. "In & Out" sends up sexual orientation, 
celebrity status, political views and even supermodels, all with 
Rudnick's hilariously askew viewpoint. What else can be said when Steven 
Seagal is in the runnings for an Oscar opposite Cameron -- albeit for a 
film called "A Snowball in Hell"? A few plot elements seem too 
coincidental, but "In & Out" never quite isolates itself in reality. Only 
the finale becomes too preachy for its own good. 
A sterling cast appears to be having an immense deal of fun with 
Rudnick's acid-glazed one-liners. This is one of Kevin Kline's best 
performances since "A Fish Called Wanda;" he deftly balances the
satirical side of Howard with the human one, and creates a wonderful, 
realistic comedic character. Those in supporting roles have great moments 
as well. Even the usually low-key Selleck manages a surprise sequence 
with Kline that will have Jerry Falwell reaching for his Tums. If "In & 
Out" has a scene-stealer, though, it's got to be Joan Cusack. Her 
interpretation of Emily's Ms. Havisham-esque personality merits serious 
Oscar consideration, especially in a great, wacky Cusackian moment where 
she throws her hands up in the air and exclaims, "Is everybody gay? Am
I in 'The Twilight Zone'?" 
"In & Out" is a prime example of how to do a farce right, from writing to 
acting to timing to editing. What remains to be seen, though, is how well 
this type of film will play with the absense of such a nationally 
accessible star like Robin Williams. Will people go see "In & Out" for 
its broad comedy and make it a "Birdcage"-sized hit, or be put off by 
such potentially edgy material and send it the way of "To Wong Foo"? 
Whatever happens, smart audiences will pack themselves in and not stay
out.

        It's taking awhile, but slowly the comedy genre of straight 
actors playing gay guys is going mainstream. What began with 
outrageous dragfests like TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR 
EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR and THE BIRDCAGE has given 
way to more realistic, traditional morality-threatening films like 
IN & OUT. The beauty of IN & OUT, in its message of toleration and 
individuality, is that it can still be enjoyed by the most homophobic 
hetero men because it's just plain funny.
        Frank Oz, who ten years ago brought us DIRTY ROTTEN 
SCOUNDRELS, directs from a script by Paul Rudnick. A lot of times, 
IN & OUT is just as merciless on pop culture as the Rudnick-penned 
ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES, with the same quota of intelligent one-
liners. It's a good foundation for a movie that is full of extraordinarily 
likeable people -- I loved seeing Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Bob 
Newhart and Debbie Reynolds all make me laugh in one movie.
        The leading man here is Kevin Kline, who has exuded 
smarmy masculinity in comedies like A FISH CALLED WANDA and 
FRENCH KISS. The best word to describe his IN & OUT character is 
"prissy." He is an English teacher, absolutely nuts about sonnets and 
Streisand. He wears neatly-tailored suits, rides to school on a bike 
rather than destroy the environment and can't resist dancing no matter 
how hard he tries. It's not as if these are innately bad things, just not 
commonly accepted macho behavior.
        Still, everyone thinks this is all right because Kline is 
engaged to Cusack and has been for the past three years. They haven't 
consummated the relationship, so we sense Kline's "heterosexuality" 
may never have been lab tested. And when the school's most famous 
actor alumnus (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar (for a hilariously bad turn 
as a gay military officer), dedicating his performance to Kline with the 
words "and he's gay!" all small town hell breaks loose.
        It turns into a media circus, with every conceivable question 
thrown at Kline ("Do you know Ellen?"). Things get unstable. 
Principal Newhart, still stammering as much as ever, makes it clear 
that Kline's job is in jeopardy if what Dillon said is true. Kline's 
parents (Reynolds and Wilford Brimley) begin to come undone. 
Reynolds, almost continuing her MOTHER performance, can't 
imagine going to her grave without throwing a wedding for her son, 
and Brimley... well, old Wilford don't want no fruit for a kid because, 
remember, Quaker Oats are "the right thing to do," not men.
        Selleck, sans moustache and Hawaiian shirt, is the most 
aggressive TV journalist out to make Kline's life hell, and we soon 
find out why. He's very, very gay and he's digging for more than just 
the scoop. Yeah, he's got the hots for Kev, but Kline is in denial and 
Cusack's life would lie in ruins without this wedding. Her situation, 
losing a lot of weight to net a man so she'll have some self esteem, 
deserves almost as much sympathy as Kline's search for a sexual 
identity.
        IN & OUT draws a huge laugh quotient from a still-
controversial premise, and directs it in such a way that it still turns 
into a happy, idyllic ending with a mate for everyone and a MR. 
HOLLAND'S OPUS testimonial climax. Even the villain figures, like 
Newhart and Dillon's insensitive, anorexic model girlfriend (Shalom 
Harlow), are likeable, and boogie with everyone else in the closing 
sequence.
        There's an entirely different genre of serious-as-hell gay 
dramas that focus on the real struggles of the homosexual community, 
but it's this fun fluff that draws the big names and the big bucks at the 
box office. IN & OUT is no exception.

Seen on 26 September 1997 with Linda for $9 at the SONY Lincoln Square
As an acquaintance put it, "*In & Out* is good PR for the gay community in
middle America." This is a very perceptive description of this
high-concept situation comedy. Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a
high-school English teacher who about to get married. He lives in a small
town in Illinois and the story takes place on the eve of the Oscars. One
of the alumni, actor Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), has been nominated for
Best Actor. So, the whole town is watching and waiting to see if he will
win. He does, and cites Howard as one of his inspirations, and he
announces, "and he's gay."  Howard does his best to reassure his newly t
hin fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack), his parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford
Brimley), his principal (Bob Newhart), and his friends and students that
he is fact *not gay*.
But there is also the small matter of satisfying the media circus that
camps out in the town the very next day.. One infotainment reporter--Peter
Malloy (Tom Selleck)--is gay himself, and relentless hounds Howard about
the status of his sexual orientation.
Without giving too much away, I can safely say that the characters are
strictly l ight and fluffy. From Debbie Reynolds as the mother who claims
she needs Howard's wedding the way an addict needs heroin, to Joan Cusack
as the befuddled bride-to-be, there are a lot of harmless chuckles to be
had here. Just about *everyone* is a stereoty pe here. What ensues is an
exploration into "what makes a man a man" and it does so very humorously. 
A very memorable scene: Howard listening to a tape to "improve
masculinity."
It all leads to an obligatory happy ending, obligatory since it is a
comedy. It even has the feel of a *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington*; fairness
must win the day.
Perhaps the most important aspect of this movie is that it garnered the
number two spot for its opening weekend. This officially marks the end of
the "invisible gay man" in the minds of the mainstream moviegoer. In a
year when Ellen Degeneres comes out on national TV, *In & Out*'s number
two status means more straight people are seeing positive gay images than
ever before. I read recently that movies have to do well in the heart of
America and if they do, they will succeed everywhere. Paul Rudnick, author
of *Jeffrey* and the alter-ego of Libby Gelman-Waxner, is a funny and
talented writer, which contributes greatly to this success. It might not
be among the top ten mo vies I will ever see, but it is enjoyable, and its
success at this time is very telling.

It's difficult to write a review of 'In and Out' without giving too much
away.  When I first heard about this film that bills itself as a comedy I was
afraid that it might be offensive to members of the gay community.  I don't
know how some will react but as a straight person, I found it had many
problems which I will describe later on.  It's about a small town English
teacher (Kevin Kline) whose former student goes on to win an Academy Award
and during his acceptance speech thanks everyone who helped him make it
possible and in his thanks he singles out Kline as his former teacher and
declares at the end of his speech that Kline is gay.  Needless to say this
causes the usual uproar of intolerance within the community from the close
minded while it shocks and surprises many others.  Kline insists he is NOT
gay but it's hard to convince everyone and his wedding is in three days!
Two of the best films I've seen in recent years dealing with homosexuality
were 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' (1985) and 'Longtime Companion' (1990).  What
these films had in common is that they both took a forward look at their
subject matter without making more about their themes than was necessary.
 They were extremely well acted (William Hurt won the Oscar for 'Kiss of the
Spider Woman') and they were memorable.  What 'In and Out' does is take this
very sensitive subject matter and treats its second half by being flagrantly
condescending.
To tell you anything more than that would spoil the film but its climax is
disappointing and the entire film has frumpy humor to boot and doesn't quite
know in many scenes when to make its point and leave.  When the credits roll
up the screen there are many unanswered questions and 'In and Out' is a true
disappointment and believe me if you've laughed at the coming soon attraction
of this film or the television commercial advertising it, then you've already
seen most of the funny moments.

        It is no small feat to say this, but this is one of the funniest 
movies that I have ever seen.  I have never laughed so much in a theater 
before.  But beware, there exists a cynical approach to the movie that if 
taken, could force you to miss the point.
        Allow me to first dispel the cynical viewpoint that this movie
essentially stereotypes gay people.  As you watch this film, you have to 
suspend political correctness, as the writing displays through his 
exploitation of misconceptions about gay 
people that many have.  This is not a movie about being gay, but about 
how gay people have been perceived, making the portrayals and reactions of 
people in this movie are more real than any watered down effort 
would bring.
        If you choose to take a less cynical approach to the movie, you 
will find that "In and Out" is full of good intentions and rich in laughs.  
Welcome to Greenleaf, Indiana, where everyone knows you and your 
business, probably better than you do.  Howard Brackett, English teacher 
and lifelong resident, is preparing for his wedding to Emily Montgomery 
(Joan Cusack) after a three year engagement.  It never dawned on him that 
this delayed wedding, combined with his tastes for poetry and drama, his 
clean look, and his affinity for everything Streisand would even cause 
others to question his sexual preference.  It is not until former student, 
Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), wins an Academy Award for portraying a gay 
soldier in "To Serve and Protect," and outs Howard as his gay inspiration in 
his acceptance speech, that Howard's reality comes crashing down around him.
        Greenleaf comes to a standstill as many were watching the 
telecast, and all know Howard.  Almost immediately, Howard's 
parents (Wilfred Brimley and Debbie Reynolds) arrive searching for 
answers.  In a classic scene Howard denies this, and the small town 
conspiracy theories spring up as to why Cameron would sabotage Howard's 
life.  Spouting non-sequitors, which any townie will appreciate and 
identify with, Howard's parents drag Cameron's name through the mud in 
their support of their son.
        The problem is, Howard is torn between two identities, one of 
which is a lie.  To help him sort out his life comes gay tabloid reporter 
Pater Malloy (Tom Selleck).  For a ratings jump, Malloy decides to spend 
the week cataloguing Howard's every move.  Hounded, Howard begins to see 
the error of his lies to all that he loves and realizes that he will only 
be a better person for the truth to come out.  It is both painstaking and 
humorous to watch as the loacals do all the predictable actions when 
Howard is around.  Students he coaches cover up in the locker room, 
fellow teachers spout their suspicions, and the principal threatens his 
job.  In an effort to live up to his lie, Howard seeks out ways to seem 
more masculine.  He uses self-help tapes and even goes to a priest, who 
offers some unique advice about premarital sex.  
        The biggest snag he faces will be Emily's reaction.  She has been 
losing weight to improve her self image so that she could make Howard 
love her more, creating a double lie around her life.  Howard 
does make right, but at the most inopportune time in front of everyone he 
knows.  This sends Emily reeling and creates some of the best comedic 
scenes of Joan Cusack's career.  She rants, she reels, and she gives the 
most memorable quote in defaming Barbara Streisand.  
        The Oscar-nominated Cusack ("Working Girl") is flamboyently 
funny as the disshevelled bride, while Kline's vulnerable and scared 
teacher is many times funnier than his Oscar winning performance in "A Fish 
Called Wanda," not an easy task to accomplish.  There does not seem to be a 
part that Kevin Kline takes to which he cannot bring some sort of 
credibility.  He excels in the great movies ("Wanda," "Dave") and adds 
respectability to lesser films like "Consenting Adults" or "Fierce 
Creatures."  The acting standouts do not stop here, though.
        The supporters take the characters to which they are accustomed 
and make them soar in "In and Out."  As the school principal, Bob Newhart 
stutters his way through in Porky Pig fashion whenever the tension 
rises.  Wilfred Brimley is the venerable old everyman and Debbie Reynolds 
recaptures her "Mother"ly instincts as the overbearing mom.  In smaller 
roles, Dan Hedaya ("Clueless") plays an army officer in the film within the 
film, drawling his way into the memory, and Ernie Sabella ("Perfect 
Strangers") captures the small town attitude toward the media as Howard's 
barber.  The only departue from character comes from Magnum P.I. himself.  
Selleck has done wonders in revamping an acting career that had suffered 
under the likes of "Mr. Baseball," and has forsaken nothing to prove his acting 
chops.  The scenes with him and Kline are the best and will leave you 
talking afterward.
        Toward the end of the movie, Greenleaf High is graduating, and 
nearly-exiled Howard shows up.  Cameron comes home to save the day and 
interrupts the ceremony a la Al Pacino in "Scent of a Woman" inciting a 
display which echoes the ending of "Dead Poet's Society" in a more humorous 
tone.
        "In and Out" is loosely based on Tom Hanks' Oscar acceptance 
after winning for "Philadelphia," when he thanked his openly gay drama 
teacher.  Writer Paul Rudnick, who wrote another politically incorrect gay 
comedy "Jeffrey" and director Frank Oz (Muppet movies) have landed a gold 
mine with this film.  It is not only funny, but they might have finally 
mainstreamed gay characters by exploiting the very assumptions surrounding 
them that independant films have been combatting for years.  By ignoring 
the sacred cow, this movie could open doors for future movies.  This 
would make "In and Out" not only one of the best comedies I have ever seen,
but one of the most meaningful.

     Follow the bouncing ball and sing-along, "Macho, macho man, I want
to be a macho man."  Now, as this is essentially IN AND OUT's theme
song, keep it going in your subconscious as you read the rest of this
review, and it will put you in just the right mood to hear about one of
the funniest comedies of the year.
     Remember when Tom Hanks received the Academy Award for
PHILADELPHIA and thanked his gay high school teacher?  Well, when
producer Scott Rudin heard this, he had an immediate idea for comedy.
What if the teacher either wasn't gay or wasn't known to be gay?
     The resulting movie, IN AND OUT, by writer Paul Rudnick from
JEFFREY and director Frank Oz from THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD and DIRTY
ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, literally bursts with comedic energy.  The audience
at my advanced screening laughed so hard and so often that it would
take another viewing to hear all of the delicious jokes properly.
     Set in the Normal Rockwell hamlet of Greenleaf, Indiana, the story
opens on a prissy high school drama teacher named Howard Brackett, who,
after a long, three-year engagement, is finally going to tie the knot
in just one week. Kevin Kline, reportedly chosen after Steve Martin
passed on the part, plays Howard.  In short, he is terrific especially
in the film's dance routine.  (For the record, I think Steve Martin
would have been even better but Kline gives a performance worthy of
Oscar consideration.)
     Tonight is the Oscars presentation and the entire town gathers
around their television sets to see if Howard's ex-student Cameron
Drake, played as a blonde Hollywood airhead by Matt Dillon, will win
the award for best actor.
     The real Academy Awards show should be this funny.  After film
clips of Cameron in an awful war picture, Glenn Close names the best
actor nominees including Steven Seagal for A SNOWBALL IN HELL, an
obvious reference to his chance of ever getting the real award.  When
Cameron wins, he thanks everyone, finishing with, "To Howard Brackett
from Greenleaf, Indiana [Pause] and he's gay."
     The entire town freezes for a moment.  When they recover, Howard
tells his fiancee Emily Montgomery, played by Joan Cusack, that he has
no idea what Cameron is talking about.  Two nanoseconds later, his mom
(Debbie Reynolds) and dad (Wilford Brimley) appear on his doorstep.  "I
may sue," Howard off-handedly suggests to them.  "Get Johnny Cochrane,
not that woman," advises his dad.  Aren't parents helpful?
     The next morning a phalanx of television reporters descends on the
high school.  Most leave the following morning, but gay reporter Peter
Malloy, played with intense pseudo-seriousness by Tom Selleck, stays
for the week.  He does man-on-the-street interviews, asking the
question that all America wants to know -- Will Howard actually get
married at the end of the week?  In one report, Peter summarizes the
troubles with poetic drama.  "A teacher in trouble," he intones.  "A
town under siege.  A journey to the Heartland.  Stay tuned."
     Easily the funniest part of the show is the training Howard puts
himself through to demonstrate his masculinity.  He hopes to convince
the town that he truly isn't gay.  He plays a self-help tape where he
is supposed to repeat the tough guy lines.  He repeats the first two
fine -- "Yo" and "Hot damn."  When he repeats the third, "What a
fabulous window treatment," the tape stops him in mid-sentence saying,
"That was a trick."
     The tape then instructs him that real men don't dance.  ("Be a
man.  Think of John Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Arnold doesn't
dance.  He can barely walk.")  Howard goes wild at this point in an
uncontrollable and well choreographed dance routine to "Macho man."
You will never be able to hear this song again without dancing around
the room.
     The script itself is the real star of the show.  It manages to
elicit huge laughs without resorting to slapstick, and it finds humor
in unlikely spots.  One group of elderly women decide to bare their
secrets.  One confesses to having pilfered a special Rice Krispy Treat
recipe from a dead woman's recipe file, and another fesses up to having
hated THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.
     Everyone in the movie is in top form.  Bob Newhart, as the dour
principal, gets away with lines that would sound ridiculous coming from
anyone else.  Joan Cusack takes a simple prop -- a fluffy white wedding
dress -- and does more funny things with it than would seem possible.
When she enters a tiny car with automatic shoulder straps, for example,
she is engulfed in a sea of lace.
     Even minor characters such Cameron's trophy girlfriend,
swizzle-stick-looking supermodel Sonja, played with suitable coldness
by Shalom Harlow, get great lines.  When Cameron has the audacity to
suggest they go to Greenleaf to help Howard, she tells him she is busy
right now.  She has a show to do she says and, "I have to shower and
vomit."
     About halfway through the film, the writer briefly looks as though
he has painted himself into a comedic corner, but he extricates the
story quickly and picks right back up with the humor.  The show ends
with a suitably uproarious sequence.
     IN AND OUT is such a splendid and infectiously happy comedy that
when you walk through the parking lot after the movie, you will
undoubtedly still be able to hear the audience's laughter and the
show's energetic music reverberating in your head.
     IN AND OUT flies by at just 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for mature
themes and a little profanity.  The show would be fine kids around ten
and up.  I recommend the picture to you highly and give it *** 1/2.

In & Out (1997)
Rated PG-13 for sex-related dialogue and some strong language.
Starring: Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck.
----------    Out of 4 stars: **** (4 Stars)
As if you haven't heard, either from reading other reviews, or
actually witnessing the event, Tom Hanks outted his high school drama
teacher in his Oscar acceptance speech for "Philadelphia."  While his
teacher had already been out, and since there is hardly any humor
behind that, producer Scott Rudin asked Paul Rudnick ("Jeffrey,"
another hilarious gay-related film) to write a screenplay about the
same event happening; only the teacher wouldn't be gay.  And so In &
Out is brought to the screen from a gifted writer, and a talented
director and cast.
It's been a long time since I have laughed this hard during a film.
There are several films which made me laugh recently, but none of them
are going to remain in my memory once they get shuffled off to the
video shelves.  But In & Out will stay in my mind for a long time to
come.  It is the best comedy of the year, and I doubt any comedy will
be able to compete with it.  Unlike Rudnick's last screenplay
"Jeffrey," In & Out didn't focus on sex or the grief it can cause.
Instead, it allows every type of person, even your most conservative
homophobe, to enjoy the sharp-witted humor.  Rudnick also wrote the
very funny "Addams Family Values," which just happened to be better
than the original.  He has proven himself a talented writer, who can
create one-liners, funnier than any you have probably ever heard.  But
not all the humor comes from the dialogue.  Much of it comes from
reactions of the cast, and Kline's physical humor, as he showed in "A
Fish Called Wanda."
In & Out is a film that works on a lot of different levels, which most
Hollywood films pretend to do.  It has satirical elements,
above-standard-fair humor, and in the midst of all the comedy, it
slyly works in some social discrimination problems.  I advise you to
not read ANY review of this film before you watch it.  Not even this
one.  Stop right here if you haven't seen it.  Stop.  Stop!  Okay, so
it isn't that important, but if you do read on, I won't be the one to
spoil those surprises.  Luckily, before I went to film I forgot to
read my local critic's review of the movie.  Lucky, because he spoiled
both of the surprises.  Anyway, In & Out begins in the small town of
Greenleaf, Indiana.  They are all awaiting one of the most anticipated
nights of the town's year: the Academy Awards.  Why?  Former student
from Greenleaf, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), has been nominated for
Best Actor.  The film he is nominated for is a funny spoof of Forrest
Gump, mixed with Philadelphia.  Not surprisingly, he wins (you see
that in the trailer) and he praises his high school English teacher,
Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline).  "... and he's gay." Drake adds,
surprising not only the entire town of Greenlead, but Brackett and his
wife, Emily (Joan Cusack), as well.  
The next day, the town is swarming with reporters, trying to get the
feature on the teacher who was outted by his student.  One of those
reporters is Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck, in a nearly perfect
performance) who wants to do an entire week on Howard.  But he isn't
fond of the idea because he is getting married in three days, after
three years of being engaged (and not once physically bonding the
relationship).  All of his students want to know, as well as the
principal (Bob Newhart, doing his best kind of comedy--deadpan).  Of
course, because Howard has now been declared as a homosexual, the
school board is concerned "for the children."  Yeah, right.  The
principal tells Howard that if he does not get married, then he will
be dismissed from his teaching duties.  And to top that off, his
parents are gravely concerned.  Berniece and Frank Brackett (Debbie
Reynolds and Wilford Brimley) are confused, but as Berniece puts it,
"You better have this wedding.  I need something beautiful in my
life... it's like heroin."
But the most concerned is Howard himself.  Howard tries to make
himself more masculine using audio tapes, and by ripping his clothes
off in order to finally consumate their relationship.  The scene
involving the masculinity tapes is the funniest scene in the entire
film.  Not that other scenes aren't funny, but this is the moment In &
Out will most likely be remembered for... oh, and one of the two
surprises.  The biggest problem with the film is that the film drags
towards the end, but thankfully spoofs "Spartacus" to bring up the
comedic level again.  Surprisingly, In & Out does incorporate some
plot twists into its straight-forward storytelling.  Some of the plot
twists are mild, such as the speech from Drake, and some are
completely shocking if you don't know what is going to happen.
I am giving In & Out four stars because not only is it above your
usual standard shtick, but it makes you care for the characters, and
then makes you feel giddy and happy at the end.  I already want to see
it again.  It's amazing to see a comedy like this released these days.
While the subject matter tackled is rather lightweight, many
heterosexual men will probably try and avoid seeing the film.
However, I advise seeing it.  While it is offensive in some parts, it
mainly comes from the language, and most of it coming from the mother
and her friends.  Even if you are homophobic or extreme conservative
people, if you like to laugh, I highly recommend In & Out.  It is not
only the best comedy of 1997, but it is also one of the best overall
films.  Some people may claim that it is predictable and unfunny, but
I was surprised several times, and while the ending is inevitable, it
is not predictable.  
The cast is essential for this film to work, as for every other film
to work.  But never have I seen a cast work so well together.  Well,
in a comedy anyway.  In Jim Carrey's films, it's usually just Carrey
doing his stuff, but In & Out relies on intelligent writing and good
performances from the cast.  Kevin Kline gives the best performance of
the film, and hopefully he will at least get another Oscar nomination.
Kline proves that he is one of America's best comedians, and he
doesn't have to overplay anything to get laughs.  Kline has the facial
expressions to make you laugh, and he also knows to say his lines as
if he were being serious, and relying on Rudnick's dialogue to carry
through.  Sometimes, Kline is able to get laughs out of lines that
wouldn't have been funny with any other actor.  Joan Cusack is still
brilliant, and I could watch her for hours.  She has perfect timing,
and her struggles with her dilemma is hilarious.  Tom Selleck, whom I
haven't seen since Citizen Ruth, gives one of his best performances
ever.  I hope to see him on the screen more, because he has a natural
screen presence which many actors lack.  Matt Dillon uses a wry tone
when delivering his lines which make them all the more funnier.
Shalom Harlow plays Drake's bulemic girlfriend, and her stiff lines
make them funny.  Her look at the rotary phone is a gem.  Debbie
Reynolds picks up where she left off in Mother, and Wilford Brimley
turns in a good performance.  Bob Newhart fits very nicely among the
cast, and he also gives some of the best reactions to what is going
on. But it's Kline's show, and he runs with it.
In & Out is rated PG-13 for sex-related dialogue and profanity.
Director Frank Oz (who also did the hilarious "Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels") gives the film a professional look to it, and he also
makes the satirical moments much more funny.  The conservative town is
given a "Leave it to Beaver" feel, and Oz knows how to let his actors
go.  Many Barbra Streisand remarks are funny enough that even
Streisand should laugh.  Kline's dancing deserves an Oscar, just for
that, which compares to Travolta's of "Saturday Night Fever."  And
hopefully Rudnick will get noticed more with his bright and funny
screenplay.  A classic ensemble piece which seems like it came from
the early 80s, and changed the morals and story.  Physical humor is
hard to get, but physical humor and spoken humor is nearly impossible.
In & Out does it and does it well.  This is one of the year's best
films.

The one thing that I'd like to know about In & Out is whose idea was it to
make a story that tries to be everything? It's the same question I asked
myself after watching Independence Day and The Fifth Element.
The story starts trying to be funny, fails at that. Then it tries to take on
issues of stardom and how it affects people's lives. Fails again. Of course
it tries to tackle the gargantuan issue of in-the-closet homosexuality but
fails at that one too.
Truth to be told, if it weren't for the fact that I long ago vowed to never
fall asleep or walk out on a movie, I wouldn't have made it through the hour
and forty minute film. I found myself yawning, scratching my eyelids,
looking towards the exit sign and pondering leaving, moving around in my
chair constantly just trying to find that perfect position that doesn't
exist.
Anything to avoid the movie.
What was even more disappointing was the failure to live up to the good hype
that the movie received. And what was worse than that was the fact that I
expected more from every member of the cast and crew. Director Frank Oz did
"What About Bob?" which is one of the funnier movies I have seen. Kevin
Klein did "Dave". Joan Cusack as been in things like "Adams Family Values",
"Grosse Pointe Blank" and "Nine Months", each one funny in there own right.
Yet the combination of all of these ends up less than zero.
If you want to see something completely stupid, that's your own fault.

With the high ratings generated last season by Ellen's coming-out
episode on her self-titled hit television show, it seemed like only a
matter time before the big studios released something along those same
lines.  The line, in this case, is the one that people cross when they
admit to others that they are gay.  Issues surrounding gay lifestyles
have increasingly crept up into mainstream Hollywood over the last few
years.  Most have been farcical looks at gayness such as the inanely
funny The Birdcage.  Other films feature gay characters to add
contrast and shock value to the story line as in Bound.  But this is
perhaps the first film that tries to take a semi-serious look at
someone exploring  his sexuality, discovering, in fact, that he might
be gay.
Semi-serious, of course, because the film focuses on high school
teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline).  In a small town somewhere in
America's idyllic heartland, Howard teaches romantic poetry, sits with
his legs daintily crossed, and wears a bow tie.  He is also outwardly
effeminate and also loves Barbara Streisand (he's seen Funny Girl a
dozen times).  Yet despite all of this evidence, he is engaged to a
wistful love, fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack).
As the wedding quickly approaches, fate steps in.  One night while
watching the Oscars, one of his former students, Camerron Drake (Matt
Dillon), garners the gold statuette for Best Actor.  In his acceptance
speech, he graciously thanks everyone, including his teacher, but also
announces that Brackett is gay to the millions of TV viewers, not too
mention the population of the town.  
Howard is stunned.  The town is stunned.  His parents quickly rush
over.  "Is there anything that you want to tell us," they gingerly
ask?  He exclaims, "I'm not gay!"   Soon after, the media storms into
town.  He becomes hounded by a second-rate reporter named Peter Malloy
(Tom Selleck) who is looking for his big break.  Moreover, Peter is
gay and has come out, and he urges Howard to do the same.
Ultimately, after a hilarious scene that focuses on Howard's
masculinity test, which he fails with flying colors, he realizes after
all these years why he runs around with a limp hand.  The rest of the
movie shifts its attention to how Howard copes with his new-found
lifestyle and how the town copes with him.  Under the direction of
Frank Oz, who breathes light comedy, we see Howard's life slowly
disintegrate around him.  Emily is furious, the faculty and students
become wary, his father is in disbelief (a wholesome-as-can-be Wilford
Brimley), and the dreams of his wedding-needing mother (a perky and
belligerent Debbie Reynolds) is shattered.   
Shattered is also how this reviewer felt after leaving the theatre.
In it's quest to explore breakthrough material, this movie seemed to
try too hard to remain politically correct.  It took great strides not
to mock anyone.  For a movie about gayness, it seemed
amazingly...uh...mainstream.  It seemed to be void of any major
conflict that demanded a resolution.  It seemed to lack any conviction
in trying to give this film bite.  It failed to connote the fragility
of the experience and seemed all to willing to let Kline's comic charm
lead his way nonchalantly in and out of precarious situations that
surrounded his sexuality.  The ending reeks of schmaltz as it looks
for a feel-good way to wrap it all up.
Perhaps the intent was not to rock the boat or to offer a
groundbreaking film.  That's probably better left to the independent
filmmakers. The movie is certainly not a work of comic - or
philosophical - genius either.  However, it's strong showing at the
box office signals a growing acceptance for movies that explore this
topic.  Your reward for seeing this film, though, is a great cast of
characters, especially Tom Selleck and Debbie Reynolds and also Bob
Newhart who plays the nervously cautious high school principal.  But,
that's the only reward you'll find.  Like the gay community, I'm sure
that I'm in the minority when I say that this film is a tepid comedy
at best.  In and Out meanders in and out of sometimes-amusing scenes,
but it never seems to quite go anywhere at all.

Those looking for a sensitive and honest look at the problems of
homophobia and repression are not advised to look to Hollywood, as the
film industry there is less than renowned these days for its profound
insights into real societal truths. The above is doubly true for comedies,
which, for better or worse, more often than not bypass thought about
issues they raise in favor of cheap sight gags; it is a fact of a life, at
least of life in Hollywood, and denouncing it amounts to words in the
multibillion-dollar-a-year wind.
The problems with the recent comedy "In and Out" are legion, but the
failure to treat the issues as real issues is primary about them. Kevin
Kline depicts a teacher inadvertently outed by a former student in the
course of the student's accepting an Academy Award; suddenly, all eyes are
on Kline and his mannerisms and tasts, as people speculate on whether he
is or isn't gay. The ever-so-subtle point is to mock the way stereotypes
of gay people--gay men, here--are elevated to truth, and how Kline's
character can "prove" that he isn't gay by conforming. The movie derives
much of its "humor" from making fun of the dumb-as- doorknobs small-town
Midwesterners and their silly beliefs, their prejudices, their shallowness
in thinking that a walk or an appreciation for Barbra Streisand is a
reliable indication of homosexuality--in short, it resorts to stereotypes,
silly and outdated ones at that. Screenwriter Paul Rudnick and director
Frank Oz were apparently unappreciative of this irony, but your reviewer
found it a tad irritating. More to the point, where homophobia is
prevalent, there's a lot more to it than disdain for Barbra Streisand, and
what passes for it here-- misunderstanding that magically melts away by
the end of the film--sugarcoats the conflicts that go on in real life.
The characters in "In and Out" would need a lot of development to qualify
as cardboard. We learn nothing of Kline's real thoughts or feelings; even
after the pivotal scene, at his wedding, we learn nothing about what has
been going on in his mind. Kline's role is to play straight man for a host
of caricatured characters, from his mother ("I want a wedding, Howard") to
Tom Selleck as an unethical journalist to Bob Newhart as a squeamish
school principal to Matt Dillon as the self-centered Gen-X
student-turned-actor. Joan Cusack as the fiancee has little to do until
the aborted wedding, at which point she plays abandoned bridge in such an
over-the-top fashion that the character becomes, like the rest, a running
gag. (And not, if you ask this reviewer, an especially funny one. Ha
ha--you've been left at the altar and are willing to sleep with anyone. Ha
ha.) And Kline-- well, he does his physical humor well, as he always does,
but a few moments of Kline trying to act manly are far from enough to save
this film.
The astute reader objects that the real problem here is that your reviewer
just didn't find the thing funny and hence didn't appreciate what are, in
truth, standard devices for comedies. True (but wow, are these jokes
unoriginal--that ol' chuckler about a model vomiting before a photo
session, for instance)...true, your reviewer did not laugh once and has
since been considering ways he could have better spent that $8.25. But
most comedies don't set up the bulk of their humor around a real issue
that actually affects people, and most movies that do that feel compelled
to at least treat the subject with a measure of honesty. "In and Out"
plays everything for laughs, down the confrontation between parents and a
supposedly gay son--not, in the real world, a funny topic. Many of the
funny moments are given away in the trailer, for those those that remain,
well, perhaps your reviewer was nonplussed enough by the rest of the film
that he wasn't up for a laugh.
In short, "In and Out" is a movie where the gags come cheap, very cheap,
and the knowledge that closeted homosexuality actually matters in the
world is best left at the door. Though the ending testifies to the good
intentions at owkr, the treatment of the issues makes it all feel
condescending at best.
The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.
--from "Interim," by Edna St. Vincent Millay

I thought it was about the most charming movie I'd
seen in a long time.  How could anyone, male, female,
gay, straight, not fall madly in love with Kevin
Kline's performance in this movie?  He's witty,
handsome, bright, and he tries so hard to do the
right thing that he never did sit down and have
that very long talk with himself that he should
have long ago.
Even Tom Selleck, despite the kind of sleazy character
he plays in this film, is likeable.  About the only two
people you really want to butcher are a couple of the
school employees, who display the only out-and-out
homophobia in the film.  (Some is displayed by
a few of the students, but they get over it pretty fast.)
In and Out is a comic gem, one of those great movies that
delivers laughs well beyond what they show in the trailer or
in the commercials.  Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are hysterical
as the couple propelled by advancing age and a pushy mother into
a wedding that she really wants and he's willing to go along with.
The movie satirizes all kinds of things related to 
Hollywood, especially Entertainment Tonight and Forrest
Gump.  Interestingly, it doesn't satirize small town life
that much, except for Howard's relationship with his
mother, at the bachelor party, and a little at the
end.  Small-town life, is, for the most part, played straight.
I do have one big complaint about this movie, and
that is its sense of time:
The movie is supposed to begin very close to Oscar time.
Anyone who lives in the northern part of the country (as
Indiana was in the last time I looked) knows that late
March is a very gray time of year.  The crocuses are
blooming and the leaves haven't hit the trees yet.  You can
see a few green buds here and there.  There's often still
ice on the small ponds and bits of snow.
So this movie looks like it was filmed in the middle of
summer.  Everything is very green and there are flowers everywhere.
It might have driven the point home better about
Howards deeply-buried sexuality to have everything
look kind of gray and barren, and maybe the flowers
start blooming once Howard starts to deal with it.
Further, they have high school graduation happening a few
days later!  Hello...Hollywood?  What public school in
America has graduation in the first week of April?
The "graduation" scene didn't need to be graduation at all.
It could have been one of these scenes where the administration
has called a meeting to discuss Howard.  The results would
have been the same.  It was shere bad planning.
Anyway, other than these nuscances, I did like the movie
very much, and congratulate Rudnick, Oz and a wonderful
cast for making one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.

IN & OUT
(Paramount Pictures)
Like a senior citizen with a nose-ring, "In & Out" wears its hipness
rather uncomfortably. A comedy that makes a half-hearted attempt to
address the currently trendy subject of "coming out," "In & Out" has
many funny moments, a typically charming performance by Kevin Kline and
a boatload of good intentions. Why then does it feel so curiously
hollow?
Part of the problem lies in the screenplay by Paul Rudnick, a bright,
sassy writer (he penned "Jeffrey" and ghostwrites the "If You Ask Me"
column by Libby Gelman-Waxner in Premiere). Rudnick's central idea is a
takeoff on Tom Hanks' famous acceptance speech at the Oscars in 1993,
when he thanked his high-school teacher for inspiration in creating the
character of the gay attorney in "Philadelphia."
In "In & Out," Matt Dillon (cleverly sending up Ethan Hawke and similar
high-minded young actors) is cast as Cameron Drake, who wins an Oscar
for his performance as a gay soldier in something called "To Serve and
Protect"; in the process, he beats out Steven Seagal, nominated for
"Snowball In Hell." Picking up the prize, Drake gives credit to his
high-school English teacher Howard Brackett (Kline),  which thrills
Brackett, his fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack) and Brackett's parents (Debbie
Reynolds and Wilford Brimley), all watching back home in Greenleaf,
Indiana. Not so thrilling however are the three little words that
follow: "And he's gay." That turns out to be news to everyone, even, it
appears, Howard, who's been planning to wed Emily that Sunday after a
three-year engagement.
It's no time at all before the tiny town is buzzing with local gossip
and reporters anxious for details. Among the newshounds is Peter Malloy
(Tom Selleck, looking like he's seen better days), who dogs Brackett,
determined to get a career-saving exclusive. The rest of the story
follows Brackett's desperate attempts to assert his masculinity and
heterosexuality, his mom's efforts to keep the wedding on track, and the
town's struggle to determine exactly what to think about this bombshell.
Amusing moments abound in the film, as Brackett has to fend off
questions like "do you know Ellen?", and has to defend the honor of
Barbra Streisand against a lout who claims "she was too old for
"Yentl"." But Rudnick seems to be reining himself in: Every time the
movie seems on the verge of taking off into something truly wild and
edgy, it quickly retreats, almost apologetically. The big moment in "In
& Out," a lingering kiss between Brackett and Malloy, is not exactly
going to rock anybody's world in 1997, and that image is as far out as
the film is willing to go. Rudnick's maudlin tendencies emerge in the
final reel, in the form of a lengthy "Dead Poets Society"-style scene
that falls resoundingly flat.
Director Frank Oz doesn't help matters. Though he did a terrific job
with the Steve Martin-Michael Caine vehicle "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"
years ago, Oz never finds a rhythm here. Many scenes in "In & Out"
either end abruptly or wind down without much of a punch. Everyone seems
to be taking their best shot at keeping things lively, but there's a
stifling inertia that seems to hang over the whole film like heavy
humidity, and the comic sparks never fly. James Sanford

IN AND OUT     
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Paramount Pictures/Spelling Films
 Director:  Frank Oz
 Writer:  Paul Rudnick
 Cast: Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Debbie
Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Matt Dillon, Bob Newhart
   When Tom Hanks accepted his umpteenth Oscar, he
thanked his high-school drama teacher.  This event is the
inspiration behind "In and Out," a comedy that throughout has
the signature of its world-class comic writer, Paul Rudnick. 
"In and Out" is a sit-com, but a sit-com of a high order.  Its
vignettes sends up popular American traditions of masculinity,
the gay life style, staid high-school principals,
hormone-flooded teens, Oscar ceremonies, small-town
gossips, and, best-of-all the timely category of sleazy tabloid
journalists.  Its choice moment occurs about two-thirds into
the film as English teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is
taking his marriage vows with his long-time fiance, Emily
Montgomery (Joan Cusack).  That surprising moment may
unfortunately be given away by some critics: if you're reading
reviews, then, you'd best skip over their plot synopses.  
   At one time, the topic of homosexuality was virtually taboo
in the entertainment media.  In the nineties, however, it has
become virtually a mainstay of prime-time TV, which militates
against this film's value as a wholly original or shocking piece. 
By awarding the movie a PG-13 rating, the MPAA signals that
even kids can be freely welcomed into a tale which uses the
F word only once--thereby giving the word great farcical
punch.
   Once you accept the idea that a forty-year old man would
entertain an unconsummated engagement of three years, and
that an ultra-cool actor would thank his gay English teacher at
an academy awards celebration, you'll roll with the jabs and
barbs that materialize from its various vignettes.  
   We're introduced to Howard Brackett in the classroom of
his small-town Indiana high school where he appears with a
butterfly-image bow tie, neat attire, and clean-shaven
countenance.  He is obviously the school's most popular
pedagogue, coaching the track team after classroom hours,
a situation which shocks the faculty, students and in fact the
whole town of Greenleaf when Brad Pitt lookalike Cameron
Drake (Matt Dillon) announces to an audience of hundreds of
millions that his favorite teacher is gay.  But the folks who are
close to Howard are willing to give him the benefit of the
doubt, since, after all, he is getting married in a few days and
his mom, Berniece Brackett (Debby Reynolds), is dedicated to
bringing off the momentous event even if his son is gay.  
   The performer to watch this time around is Tom Selleck,
playing against type as Peter Malloy, a TV tabloid journalist,
whose interest in the scandal is driven by more than a desire
to improve his ratings.  Manly enough in appearance, he
seems to be writer Paul Rudnick's raisonneur, trumpeting to
all that there is no such thing as a typical homosexual. 
Announcing his predilection for his own gender, Malloy plants
a sustained kiss on Howard's shocked lips in a scene which
might have caused a 1950s audience to avert to their eyes.  
   Contrived though some of the scenes may be, "In and Out"
is superior fare with its belly-laugh one-liners, its subtly woven
subtext about the absolute acceptability of homosexuality, and
its extraordinary good acting.  With the able assistance of
director Frank Oz, Joan Cusack comes across as a master of
comic timing, who draws howls from the audience with her
self-deprecatory comments, her wide-eyed surprise when she
is sexually approached by her fiance, and her self-pity at
having to lose seventy-five pounds to look good on her
wedding day.  Matt Dillon, usually cast in serious roles, stands
out as the nation's heartthrob and the catalyst behind the
ninety minutes of frenzy.  He allows the supporting performers
he's with to have their moments of fame, such as his scrawny
super-model girl friend Sonya (Shalom Harlow), who
announces that to get ready for an event she has to "take a
shower and vomit."  
   "In and Out" was photographed on Long Island, which
stands in for small-town Indiana, conveying a tightly-knit
community which gets more than its share of excitement
when reporters and paparazzi descend to exploit a story that
would be virtually ignored were it to take place in New York or
San Francisco.  "In and Out," is a sendup of stereotypes, is
bereft of serious undertones and so is lacking the resonance
of Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey."  Rudnick, best known to hundreds
of thousands of readers of "Premiere" magazine for his
monthly pseudonymous column, is that rare writer who can
work with an overused concept and make it work heartily. The
high-spirited film is capped by a joyous musical moment as
the entire cast discos to the beat of "Macho Man."  Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten

You've all seen the previews: a suburban Indiana English teacher, Howard
Brackett (Kevin Kline), watches the Oscars with his fiancee to see one of
his old students get a Golden Boy for Best Actor, only to "out" him.  Back
in 1993, something like this almost happened when Tom Hanks won an Oscar
for his portrayal of a gay lawyer with AIDS and thanked his gay teacher
from High School.  Of course, he WAS "out" anyway, but this is a movie.
As the film goes on, the now totally insecure Howard, with his bow-tie,
perfect wardrobe, and love for Barbra Streisand and Ethel Merman, becomes
the big tabloid target of the moment.  He's especially hounded by one
reporter, played by Tom Selleck (sans moustache), who turns out to also be
gay, and is out to bring Howard out of the closet.  But Howard, who really
is gay as it turns out, is trying desperately to convince himself of that,
most notably in scenes involving a bachelor party gone to the Twilight
Zone, and an absolutely hysterical scene where he tries to become a man by
listening to "Increase Your Masculinity" tapes, which include a bit about
listening to Disco music and trying not to dance.  Of course, when I saw
this film, I stood up and danced along with Howard.  I guess I'm gay or
something.
The second half of the film, following a great twist I didn't think a film
like this would take, allows some of the supporting characters to blossom,
including Howard's fiancee, Emily (Joan Cusack), who goes completely beserk
(and won an Oscar Nomination for it); his two parents (the perfectly casted
Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley), who, um, try to understand; and the
old student, a bottle-blond stud named Cameron (Matt Dillon), who's dating
a thin model (Shalom Harlow), and is trying to make ammends for what he has
done.
The ending, a hilarious spoof on the films of Frank Capra, is further proof
of how funny this film can be, walking right on the edge between parody and
preachiness.  Some may say it's not funny or too message-y, but it's the
kind of old time audience rousing experiment that has a serious message but
never feels forced.
I'm actually surprised this kind of film would be made and distributed as a
light-hearted comedy.  It's the best thing to do with it, and you'd figure
that a major Hollywood distributor would axe the idea before it could even
be written.  It's a film that pokes fun at the whole idea that someone
being gay is actually an issue.  It's a film that jokes around with the
whole concept of "homophobia."  And yes, it's a riot.
It does this by being completely politically incorrect and taking
visciously hysterical stabs at everything homophobic.  One of the funnier
moments is one where the just somewhat neurotic High School principle (a
classic Bob Newhart) tries to say "homosexual" and gets there before he
says it.  Or another sequence where a group of jocks sit in the locker room
and try to make some kind of sense out of homophobia ("It's against, like,
nature...and indoor plumbing").  Screenwriter Paul Rudnick, a openly gay
man who also writes a hysterical column in Premiere Magaizine every month
under the psuedonym Libby Gellman-Waxner, has so much fun making fun of
everything that it's hard not to laugh.  His Oscar ceremony, featuring such
Best Actor Oscar nominations as Paul Newman for "Coot" and Steven Seagal
for "Snowball in Hell," is one of the many big hoots of the film.  In
short, Rudnick's script is a gem.
However, it doesn't try and be nasty against heterosexuals in anyway.  Paul
Rudnick takes a strictly lassez-faire approach to the homosexuality
controversy in America - it's as if he's looking at homosexuality and just
saying "Who the FUCK cares?"  And by presenting it as a light-hearted
comedy (I mean, Frank Oz directs - the man is incapable of melodrama), he
gives it a fun air, something that anyone, and I mean anyone, can enjoy.
"In & Out" is absolutely, definitely one of the funniest, most hysterical
films I've seen in a long while, at least the funniest to ever actually say
something about Americana.  I'd say it's the cinematic equivalent of that
great episode of "The Simpsons" where Homer finds out that a good friend of
his is in fact "ho-mo-sexual."  Like that show, it makes fun of all kinds
of stereotypes in life, and comes out as being completely hilarious and
never preachy.  And I almost literally laughed my ass off.  That has to
mean something.

Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Bob Newhart, Shalom Harlow Director: Frank Oz
Screenplay: Paul Rudnick
This comedy about coming out is in many ways both right and wrong. It
supposes that a man in his thirties, who has remained a closet
homosexual for most of life, needs to come out and announce to the world
that he is gay  on his wedding day. My point is we don't see the
average heterosexual needing to affirm their sexuality on their wedding
day, even when there has been a sudden change of heart. I don't think
the words I'm sorry I can't marry you but I'm straight by the by' are
in any ways familiar. So why does Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) a
clean-cut, neat, prissy looking bachelor feel the urge to stage a
fanfare of excitement before his wedding? The business of coming out'
is as baffling as it comes. We don't see heterosexuals needing to affirm
their sexual orientation to friends and family, so why does a homosexual
need to. You're either straight or gay and some fall in the shades
between, but really it's your own business wherever you lie.
So it comes as a big surprise to all concerned when Howard Brackett
(Kevin Kline), ordinary schoolteacher of Green Leaf Indiana, is
pronounced gay at the Academy Awards. Kline's wonderful comic talents
are used to highlight the none-to-subtle stereotyping of gay men. The
floppy hand gestures, tilted stance, Streisand loving, music funking
demeanour are entertainingly underlined by Kline, but I'm sure that
these quirks are not true of all gay men. Unfortunately most of this
movie's most humorous scenes are overexposed in the trailer, and if
you've seen the trailer once too often there isn't much to look forward
to in the movie.
Of note is the 20-30 second, much talked about kiss between Kline and
Tom Selleck. The audience gasps with shock, but soon the moment is swept
to the back of the mind along with any embarrassment it may have caused.
Really there wasn't much to see to begin with. There was no licking
tongues rolling about, no undue smooching or necking, no heavy
breathing. It just looked like too grown men giving each other mouth to
mouth from a distance  not a defining hot kiss by any means. Then
there's a rather amusing discussion between schoolboys about the In'
and Out' holes. That in-holes are meant for putting things in and
out-holes are not. So what do you do for a severely constipated person
in need of a good enema?
In Conclusion, IN AND OUT is not the hilarious comedy that I had hoped
it would be. However a good point is made at the end, when the whole
town announces they are a gay to down the fallacy that homosexuality is
an infectious disease. Perhaps next time more fun could be generated
from a gay man suddenly realising he's straight  that way we can
explore the themes surrounding the cupboard heterosexual  they wear
ties, carry mobile phones and like to listen to the artist formerly
known as Prince.

A review by Ed Johnson-Ott  copyright 1997
For more reviews, visit www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film".
Comedies rarely receive the respect they deserve, which is a shame. 
Critical accolades are generally reserved for verbose, showy dramas about 
"important" subjects, with comedies dismissed as too frivolous to be 
considered as art. Hopefully that will change with the delightful 
screwball film "In And Out". Not only is "In And Out" the funniest film 
of the year, it's also one of the best. Writer Paul Rudnick ("Jeffrey", 
"The Addams Family") has concocted a gay fairy tale that manages to 
deliver admirable messages about community, family values and the 
importance of being yourself, while maintaining a light, giddy tone and 
delivering big laughs.
Three days before his wedding, Indiana teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin 
Kline) gets the shock of his life when a former student (Matt Dillon) 
outs him during an Academy Award acceptance speech. Brackett frantically 
denies being gay as tabloid reporters turn the small town into a media 
circus. There's a lot more to the story, but revealing the surprises 
would spoil some of the fun.
>From its opening moments, Rudnick and director Frank Oz establish "In And 
Out" as a broad farce, and they never let up the pace. Kevin Kline, who 
won an Oscar for "A Fish Called Wanda", leads the exceptional cast with 
another outstanding performance. In one extremely funny scene, Kline's 
Howard Brackett receives a long, unexpected smooch from an unlikely 
source. During the kiss, Kline uses body language brilliantly to convey a 
wide range of emotional reactions without ever saying a word. This guy 
can do more acting with one leg than most performers can do with their 
whole bodies. 
Kline is surrounded by one of the stronger casts in recent memory. Joan 
Cusack is a riot as Brackett's co-dependent fiancée. Virtually swallowed 
by a billowy wedding gown, she takes the ditzy character's insecurities 
and escalating sense of desperation and plays them to great comic effect. 
As a smarmy tabloid reporter, Tom Selleck gives an assured, almost impish 
performance, one of the finest of his career. Debbie Reynolds, fresh from 
"Mother", is focused and funny as Brackett's mom, a determined woman who 
tells her son, in no uncertain terms, "This wedding MUST happen. I need 
beauty, flowers and nice placemats. It's like heroin". Wilford Brimley 
and Bob Newhart give sturdy supporting performances, and Matt Dillon has 
a great time as Cameron Drake, a vacuous pretty boy film star who seems 
like a cross between Brad Pitt and Luke Perry. 
Complaints about "In And Out" are bound to surface. Some fundamentalist 
Christians will condemn the film as an elaborate piece of gay-positive 
propaganda, while certain uptight gays and lesbians will claim the film 
plays off homosexual stereotypes. What's interesting is that both 
statements are essentially true. "In And Out" uses humor, heartland 
imagery, and a musical score straight out of "Hoosiers" to create a 
sympathetic atmosphere for its gay-positive message. The film is an 
extremely effective piece of propaganda and that's a good thing. The 
"subversive" message of "In And Out" is that being gay is no big thing, 
that real communities will accept and embrace their gay brothers and 
sisters and eventually wonder why there was ever a fuss in the first 
place. Rudnick's agenda is to send audiences out of the theater with 
smiles on their faces and minds a little more open. We can certainly use 
more propaganda like that.
As far as playing off gay stereotypes, "In And Out" does it often and 
well. A number of jokes work off the common perception of gay men as 
somewhat prissy neat freaks who dress impeccably and love Streisand, 
musicals and poetry. But the film doesn't stop there. In the world of "In 
And Out", everyone is a stereotype. Reporters are opportunistic jackals, 
small-town folks are sweet, wide-eyed yokels, fashion models are bulimic 
bimbos, and actors are self-absorbed boobs. Characters are painted with 
broad strokes in farces, that's simply the nature of the beast. Hopefully,
 those on the far left and right will settle down and enjoy the film's 
great humor and enormous good will.
Along with its wonderful performances and pacing, "In And Out" boasts an 
razor-sharp script, bursting with as many pop culture references as a 
dozen episodes of "The Simpsons". In fact, "In And Out" plays a bit like 
a big-screen sitcom. That's just another part of Rudnick and company's 
canny approach. Using familiar images and a screwball comedy format, they 
have created the first wholesome, all-American, family values film about 
gays. "In And Out" is one comedy that truly deserves respect.

     A Review by Jeremiah "Spassvogel" Rickert
     I've always been a Kevin Kline fan, Silverado, Fish Called Wanda, 
Pirates of Penzance, and even his Hamlet on PBS' Great Performances.  The
minute I saw the trailer for this film, I resolved to see it.  Besides the
fact that Kline starred, it looked like a hilarious film.  I got sucker
punched by the trailer to an extent, however, as I also thought, "wow, if
there's this much funny stuff in the trailer, there must be a ton of
laughs in the rest of the film."  (Oops)
     I packed up the wife and headed to Les Cinemas Del Diablo (my name
for our local Multi-multi-plex.) The film began....
     The film concerns an English/Drama teacher at a suburban high
school, named Howard Brackett.  He loves poetry and great literary works,
but his class is more interested in his famous former student, played by
Matt Dillon.  (I'd put in his name, but my wife won't let me take notes
during a movie and I've forgotten it.) They continually interrupt his long
poetic expositions with fawning questions about him.  
     Brackett has been engaged to another teacher (played by Joan Cusack)
for three years, and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her.  The
wedding, however, becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous
student of his says during the Live Oscar broadcast that Brackett is a
homosexual.  Kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film
frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't.  The whole town
begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all
those things that confirm his sexual preference.  His closest friends
don't help matters, bringing nothing but Barbara Streisand laserdiscs to
his stag party.  There are some genuinely hilarous moments, one involving
a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity.  
     Kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by Tom Selleck, who waxes
poetic on the benefits of coming out, while at the same time doing his
best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations.  
     The movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the
wedding.  Kline stands at the Altar and is asked to take his vows...  If
you want to be surprised, don't read, I am going to reveal the ending.
...instead of saying "I do" in front of his parents and most of the town,
and even some cameras, he says "I'm Gay."  This is where the movie, in my
opinion falls apart.  Most of the humor in the film had come from Kline's
insistence that he was straight, while at the same time, loving poetry
and being a senstivie guy, dressing well, and occaisionally acting prissy.  
It reminded me of the "Effeminate Heterosexual" sketch from Saturday Night
Live.  It was funny, it was sustainably funny, and Kline's performance
made it doubly so.  However, after the wedding, the film drags on.  They
should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion, but it then gets into
the serious side of what he's done.  He reconciles with his parents and
his friends, some of which had turned on him.  There are several scenes
which seemed like a waste of time, the scene with his Mother and her
friends, which was hilarious, seemed pointless, and the scene with Tom
Selleck in the Bar with Joan seemed pointless.  
     Finally, even though I am not Catholic, I found the scene with the
Priest to be condescending.  The preist cannot believe that a man was
engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship,
proclaiming to Brackett in the third person, "He's Gay."  It got a chuckle
from the audience, but I was distracted by it, and began to tire of the
film.  By the time the wedding had come and gone, I found myself hoping it
would be over soon.  (much like this review you are saying)
Overall, if I have to quantify it, I say, Rising Action gets **** and
Climax and falling action gets *1/2 out of *****.
See it in economy time.

     Proceed no further, Gentle Reader, if you are of a delicate
constitution or prefer to see your films with no potential surprises
revealed:  I am about to "out" IN & OUT.  You see, the Paramount marketing
department has been living a lie.  They've been selling IN & OUT in
commercials and theatrical trailers as the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin
Kline), an Indiana high school teacher who hears his former student,
actor Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), thank him during an Academy Awards
acceptance speech...while simultaneously announcing to the world that
Howard is gay.  Only Howard insists he's _not_ gay.  In fact, he's engaged
to be married in less than a week to long-time sweetheart Emily
Montgomery (Joan Cusack).  It's all a big misunderstanding, he claims,
based on his cleanliness, his sense of style, and his inordinate fondness
for the Barbra Streisand oeuvre.
     Don't be deceived, Gentle Reader.  It turns out that Howard really is
gay, a fact which is driven home when a gay tabloid television reporter
(played by Tom Selleck!) plants a 15-second kiss on his lips.  An audible
gasp rustled through the auditorium where I saw the film when the audience
suddenly realized it had been duped.  A woman near me muttered, "That is
disgusting."  Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Heterosexual-American, expecting a
straight farce from IN & OUT -- emphasis on "straight" -- may be in for a
very rude awakening.
     I'm not averse to rude awakenings as a rule; in fact, I think cinema
in particular could use a lot more of them.  In this case, however, the
premise they're selling is so much more interesting than the premise they
end up using.  If IN & OUT had been about a genuinely heterosexual man who
finds himself in the middle of such a controversy, screenwriter Paul
Rudnick could have taken deadly aim at many societal quirks:  the
automatic presumption that accusations are true, the reaction of activist
groups to such an announcement (and its subsequent denial), the
stereotypical pereceptions both of truly masculine and suspiciously
effeminate behavior.  For about half its running time, IN & OUT is heading
in the right direction, but as soon as Howard admits that he's gay, it
feels like all the satirical energy has been sapped from the film.  It
becomes just another sincere plea for tolerance and understanding --
pleasant and laudable, but lacking bite.
     It's tough to be too hard on IN & OUT, because Rudnick's script is so
often so sharp.  When he sets his acidic sights on targets like 
supermodels (one is reduced to tears by her inability to operate a rotary
phone) and Steven Seagal's thesping skills (he is one of Cameron's fellow
Best Actor nominees for his performance in SNOWBALL IN HELL), the results
are blistering.  The cast supports the script with uniformly solid work,
particularly Joan Cusack in a brilliant physical performance which turns a
wedding dress into a spectacularly versatile comic prop.
     Kevin Kline's performance is also satisfying...at least half of it
is.  He's charming early on both in his exasperated insistence on his own
heterosexuality and in his living room boogie to "I Will Survive."  He
just doesn't know what to do with himself once he comes out, nor does the
script know what to do with him.  For the final half hour, Howard simply
sits around waiting for the people of Greenleaf, Indiana either to accept
him or reject him.  As a protagonist, he turns into a doormat.
     I'm not sure if director Frank Oz (HOUSESITTER, DIRTY ROTTEN
SCOUNDRELS) could have made a film with the kind of dead-eye social
commentary the "straight" IN & OUT would have required.  I would have
liked to see him try, though.  This is one of the year's few
unquestionably funny comedies, yet it's also one of the most frustrating.
Give the Paramount marketing department credit for coming up with one of
the most hilarious comic plots in recent memory, the plot to the great
film IN & OUT _almost_ was.  Instead, it's here, and it's queer, and I
guess we'll have to get used to it.

     Two years ago, writer Paul Rudnick brought his play JEFFREY to the 
screen.  The result was one of the year's most hilarious motion 
pictures.  This gay romantic comedy was sly, irreverent, and even a 
little sentimental, but, because the lead character (played by WINGS 
star Steven Weber) was a homosexual, mainstream audiences did not 
embrace the movie.  Not even the presence of STAR TREK's Captain Picard, 
Patrick Stewart, could pack in the heterosexual crowds.  So, while 
JEFFREY was regarded as a success within the gay community, it was 
quickly forgotten about outside.
     Now, in 1997, Rudnick has written another gay-themed comedy.  This 
one offers bigger laughs, more subversive humor, and a better-known 
cast.  It is surely one of the year's best pure comedies, but it remains 
to be seen whether Kevin Kline, Matt Dillon, Joan Cusack, and Tom 
Selleck have enough star power to draw mixed crowds to a film whose 
subject has traditionally made many straight males uncomfortable.  Those 
who stay away from IN AND OUT because it addresses homosexual issues 
(albeit in a light fashion) are missing an intelligent, funny motion 
picture.
     From the very first scene, you know that IN AND OUT has struck a 
rich satirical vein.  The movie opens in Greenleaf, Indiana, a 
conservative, family values-oriented town in middle America that seems 
to be stuck in the fifties.  Director Frank Oz has photographed 
Greenleaf as a place with a gauzy, fairy tale-like quality that, along 
with some very pointed dialogue, gently pokes fun at cherished, LEAVE IT 
TO BEAVER impressions of the "ideal" community.  Unlike David Lynch, who 
has repeatedly attacked this image in his films, Oz and Rudnick are 
content to have a little affectionate fun with it (much like Christopher 
Guest did in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN).  
     We are introduced to Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), one of the 
local high school's most popular teachers.  Day-in and day-out, Howard 
attempts to stir the minds of his young charges to embrace Shakespeare 
and other forms of English literature.  And, while the kids appreciate 
Howard's teaching methods, they're more interested in his recollections 
of Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a pupil from several years ago who has 
gone on to become a teen heartthrob and the odds-on favorite to win this 
year's Best Actor Oscar.  Howard is less interested in whether Cameron 
wins, however, than he is in planning his upcoming wedding to a fellow 
teacher, Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), with whom he has been engaged 
for three years.  No one is more excited about the wedding than Howard's 
mother (Debbie Reynolds), who sees the ceremony as the culmination of a 
lifelong dream.
     Then comes the bombshell.  During his internationally-televised 
acceptance speech for the Academy Award, Cameron goes out of his way to 
thank "Howard Brackett," adding, rather unexpectedly, that "He's a gay 
teacher."  Everyone, including Howard, is shocked by the statement.  The 
next day, reporters converge on Greenleaf, looking for a story.  One of 
them, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), manages to confront Howard alone, and 
what he reveals causes the confused teacher to question his own 
sexuality.  
     IN AND OUT has a thinking person's script, and, as such, works on 
several levels.  It can be seen as a light comedy, a biting satire, 
and/or a morality play that uses humor to examine society's approach to 
sexual identities.  IN AND OUT definitely isn't a pointless comedy of 
the DUMB AND DUMBER variety -- it deals with issues in a shrewd manner, 
using a creative and well-written script to camouflage with wit any 
preaching.  Gay roles and stereotypes aren't the only subject tackled by 
IN AND OUT.  The film also takes a number of pointed shots at various 
aspects of pop culture (Hollywood, the Oscars, television tabloid shows, 
supermodels, etc.).  The ending includes a wonderful spoof of the climax 
of SPARTACUS.  And the film is peppered with top-notch one-liners, the 
best of which come during the mock Oscar telecast where Cameron wins his 
statue.  
     The actors all do fine jobs.  Kevin Kline, who is no stranger to 
comedy following a pair of John Cleese movies (A FISH CALLED WANDA and 
FIERCE CREATURES) and DAVE, knows just how to play Howard to keep us 
laughing yet gain our sympathy.  Tom Selleck gives one of his best big-
screen performances by playing against type.  Joan Cusack is her usual 
delightful, ditzy self, and Debbie Reynolds picks up here where she left 
off in MOTHER.  The rest of the cast, which includes Matt Dillon, 
Wilford Brimley, and model Shalom Harlow, is equally solid.
     With IN AND OUT, Rudnick, who is openly gay, has written one of 
1997's smartest scripts.  This is a rare, "feel good" motion picture 
that doesn't insult our intelligence while making its play for our 
emotions.  Regardless of your opinion of the gay community, IN AND OUT 
is more than worth an evening's admission -- provided, of course, that 
you like to laugh.

Starring: Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Debbie Reynolds,
Wilford Brimley, Bob Newhart, Shalom Harlow and Tom Selleck
Ingredients:  a popular teacher who wears a bow tie; a long onscreen
kiss; pop psychology jargon ("After I based my entire concept of self
esteem on your willingness to marry me?"); physical comedy about macho
clichés; verbal barbs about dieting and Barbara Streisand movies.
This movie is a lighthearted comedy about acceptance. The dilemma is set
up in the first few minutes when former student Cameron Drake (Matt
Dillon), now a celebrity actor, receives a Best Actor award for playing
a gay soldier who gets discharged when it is discovered that he has
Bette Middler movies in his possession. As Drake accepts the Best Actor
award, he mentions that he owes his inspiration to Howard Brackett
(Kevin Kline), the high school English teacher of his hometown of
Greenleaf. Cameron tosses in a comment about Brackett's being gay. The
folksy residents of Greenleaf are wonderful but homophobic, so the tight
community nearly faints at the unbelievable revelation, especially since
it is only a few days before Brackett's wedding to long-suffering
fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack) and the town's upcoming Best Teacher Contest
and high school graduation.  After showcasing humorous reactions from
reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), the townspeople, students, and
Brackett himself, the movie takes us through the town's two big events
and into the ending.
Opinion:
In a light farce meant to satirize tabloid journalism, high school
principals, old TV shows, and stereotypes, it's surprising to find a
complicated character, but Kevin Kline successfully pulls off a lot of
implied character depth without unbalancing the movie's lighthearted
tone. Joan Cusack is sufficiently befuddled and exasperated as the
fiancee. Since the movie, like an interview, consists mostly of peoples'
overreactions to a single revelation, enjoyment of this comedy rests on
how funny the townspeople's remarks are, and scads of one-liners are
thrown, shotgun style,  to probe for laughs in different directions. For
example: bachelor party guys end up arguing over Barbara Streisand's
movie, Yentl,'; movie star Cameron (Matt Dillon) tells his whiny
supermodel girlfriend, "You look like a Swizzle stick," and; a gossipy
old woman confesses faking Rice Krispy treats in explaining that
everyone has something to hide.

Kevin Kline (I Love You To Death, 1990) stars in this amiable,
yet not entirely funny, comedy. He play Howard Brackett, an
English teacher in the peaceful, almost perfect town of
Greenwood. He is about to marry Emily Montgomery (Cusack),
and everything is perfect. However, one of his former pupils,
Cameron Drake (Dillon), now an actor, wins an OSCAR. And at
the end of his speech, he says that Howard is gay. Soon, the
whole town wonders if he is, Howard insists he isn't, and the
media start to invade his life, including gay reporter Peter Malloy
(Selleck). The small town of Greenwood is thrown into chaos. 
Even with this good setup, the film doesn't deliver enough good
gags. The screenwriter, Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, 1995), who is gay
himself, has written every single obvious gay joke there is. There
are no really original gags present. He also relies too much on
scenes with many people being still and looking shocked. Although
funny the first few times, the joke gradually wears out, and just
stops being funny. The cast, however, are excellent. Kevin Kline is
funny as Howard, getting increasingly panicked throughout the film.
Selleck (Three Men and a Baby, 1988) is also good as the gay
reporter, although he could of had a more meatier role. Dillon is
also good, although he hardly features in the film at all. The acting
honours, though, go to Joan Cusack, delivering a brilliant
performance of Howard's wife-to-be, and the way she goes
psycho is hilarious. Again, her role is underwritten (like every
character in this film), but she is fun. 
However, Frank Oz's direction is pretty poor. He always seems to
mess up a good joke. Like What About Bob?(1990) and Little
Shop of Horrors(1986), every time a good joke seems on the
horizon, it  never appears. There are so many missed opportunities
in this film, it hurts. The jokes that do work, though, are usually
funny, and there are some laugh-out-loud jokes in there. But the
jokes are very hit and miss, with more misses than hits. 
In & Out, then, is never quite as funny as it should be. In fact, the
only really funny scene in the film are the clips from Dillons
OSCAR winning film, "To Serve and Protect", about a gay solider.
Perhaps if that film had been made full length, it would of been
funnier than this. Although watchable, overall In & Out is never as
funny as it could be. Disappointing. 
OVERALL RATING=3D** 1/2 OUT OF ***** (2 1/2 out of 5)

1997, PG-13, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]
starring: Kevin Kline (Howard Brackett), Joan Cusak (Emily Montgomery), Tom
Selleck (Peter Malloy), Matt Dillon (Cameron Drake), written by Paul Rudnick,
produced by Scott Rudin, directed by Frank Oz.
With the wave of political correctness sweeping Hollywood it was just a
matter of time before a mainstream, "family" comedy dealt with the issue of
homosexuality. You wouldn't know it from the way "In & Out" has been
marketed, but it's actually one big political statement. Not only that, but
it's poorly scripted, over-acted, and unfunny.
Everyone knows the setup to the story - Howard Brackett (Kline), a high
school teacher in a generic suburban town is "outed" by Cameron Drake
(Dillon), a former student of his who goes on to win an Academy Award and
tells the world his "gay" teacher was his inspiration. Howard must then
explain to everyone he's not gay, but when they think about it, it seems like
he would be from the way he talks, dresses, and acts.
The first act does a mediocre job in defining the all-American (read:
"conservative") community in which the story takes place. When the media
flocks to this small town and ambushes Howard it's done so supposedly as
satire, but doesn't have any wit to it. Then the one-joke "mistaken identity"
premise comes into play and repeats itself over and over and wears out
quickly. There are a few funny one-liners here and there, but the characters
that say them seem like cardboard cutouts, not real people.
After only 40 minutes it's clear the film has run out of ideas and just
wanders aimlessly. It throws in a few scenes about Howard's inability to "be
a man," but the film's definition of "a man" is the kind of stereotypes and
cliches stand-up comedians talk about. In one scene Howard plays a self-help
tape, "Exploring You Masculinity," which includes: untucking your shirt;
belching; saying "Yo!"; and refraining from dancing. This might have been
funny on a sit-com, but it's lame and silly for such a major motion picture.
But the film presses on and starts to make supporting characters more
important. Howard's fiancee Emily (Cusak), is a recovering over-eater who
panics at the drop of a hat. Cusak is a good actress but she over-acts so
much it's exhausting (and another example of the cartoony/sit-com-esque
atmosphere). There's also Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, a gay tabloid TV
reporter who wants to exploit Howard, but Selleck doesn't play this character
nearly as sleazy as he should have. This character is used supposed in a
satirical manner, but the script is so bland you can't appreciate it.
The mid-section of the film seemed to wander a bit, which was tolerable, but
the entire last act rapidly deteriorates. A major twist in the plot occurs
which completely contradicts the premise of the film! Howard is almost
completely forgotten about and minor characters carry the story. By this
point there are no jokes left to tell and the few attempts at comedy through
gags are pathetic.
I hold the screenwriter, Paul Rudnick, responsible for the film's
substandard quality. Rudnick is an open homosexual and it's obvious this film
is his way of making mainstream America deal with homosexuality in a
supposedly funny and entertaining way. The problem is, his political
statements are so blatant they kill the comedy. The last few scenes
illustrate this perfectly as the entire town rallies around Howard after he
is fired. Howard was fired because the administrators think he's gay, but
everyone wonders what that has to do with anything. The movie becomes a big
talk show and you can tell it's supposed to make you deal with the issue
yourself, but because it's so one-sided and stupid in its delivery, it can't
be taken seriously.
"In & Out" turns out to be a real mess of a movie. It has potential, but it
assembles its pieces poorly and fails to be thought-provoking nor funny.

starring Kevin Kline, Matt Dillon, Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck
screenplay by Paul Rudnick
directed by Frank Oz
Kline stars as Howard Brackett, a dedicated high school teacher
engaged to the lovely Emily (Cusack). One of his past students,
Cameron Drake (Dillon), is up for an Academy Award, for a film about a
homosexual army soldier titled "To Serve and Protect". Brackett is
happy as a clam, until Drake wins and outs his favourite teacher
before the world. Over the next three days, Brackett has to decide
whether or not to deny the charge and carry on a charade by marrying
his fiancee, or take the advice of gay newscaster Selleck, and jump
from the closet.
Rudnick, an openly gay screenwriter, is frequently a razor sharp wit,
and no character, straight or gay, is spared. Take supermodel Shalom
Harlow (an Oshawa, Ontario, Canada native, and once a schoolmate of
mine!), who, as Drake's waif-girlfriend, doesn't want to leave her
house at one point because she still has to "shower and vomit." Or
Wilfred Brimley, as Brackett's father, who loves his son
unconditionally, even if he "got drunk, climbed the clock tower with a
shotgun and took out the whole town." But amusing as it is--there are
a great many belly laughs--the picture feels curiously cold, and the
mechanics of the plot curiously manufactured, as if it were a bad
script with a good dialogue doctor.  The Oscar ceremony is virtually
laughless, if only because it's the most off-target recreation of the
event this side of The Bodyguard. I realize that realism may not have
been the goal of this sequence, but aren't imitations and impressions
funnier when they're dead-on?
Kevin Kline is terrific, as always; Dillon's character starts out
bitingly mean--is he doing Brad Pitt?--and then goes disappointingly
soft. Selleck is good--Magnum P.I. fans everywhere will no doubt be
shocked by a certain standout scene--in a TV-ready sort of
way. Director Oz, who has in his lifetime voiced Fozzie Bear, Yoda,
and directed the brilliant Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, has a good sense
of pace, and his comic timing is often spot-on, but he lacks the edge
to make a truly cynical movie, and so the proceedings are best
described as wishy-washy.
