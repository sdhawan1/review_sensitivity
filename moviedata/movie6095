for mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 28th, 2000.
Here we have it: "Bring It On", the first feature film targeted at ten
year-olds with the sensibilities of an adult. Or maybe at adults with the
mindset of a ten year-old; frankly, it's hard to tell. Either way, "Bring
It On" is an uncomfortable melding of an After-School Special plot with
distinctly mature humor. It's not quite paedophilia, fortunately, but at
times it comes disturbingly close. Whereas movies like "American Pie" are
up-front about their attitude toward sex and profanity, "Bring It On"
couches its mature content in a maudlin, juvenile storyline. Who is this
film aimed at? The swearing and sensuality is clearly not for the young.
The story will bore anyone out of knee socks and pigtails. "Bring It On"
tries to appeal to all demographics, and in doing so becomes a peculiar
hybrid suitable for none.
Torrance "Tor" Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the
cheerleading squad at Rancho Carne, a high school in a well-to-do San
Diego neighbourhood. Although the school football team is a perpetual
disaster, the cheerleaders are champions, having placed first in the
Nationals for five years running. The squad looks set for another easy
victory until new recruit Missy (played by Eliza Dushku, the psychotic
Slayer Faith on TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") realises that all their 
routines have been cribbed from the cheerleaders of East Compton High in
urban San Diego. Tor is faced with having to develop an entirely new set
of cheers in just three weeks, before the big showdown with East Compton
and its captain, Isis (Gabrielle Union), at the National Championships.
"Bring It On" reads like a litany of teen-melodrama cliches. There are, of
course, the snobby white girls and the hip but poor black girls. There's
Tor's unfaithful college boyfriend and the new boy who's perfect for her
-- if it weren't for the misunderstandings which keep them apart. There's
the leadership challenge Tor must endure, and the inevitable climactic
meet which will decide everything. Oh, and let's not forget the
syrupy-sweet conclusion in which all wrongs are righted, and everybody
goes home happy.
But most damning of all is the fact that, for long stretches of time,
"Bring It On" just isn't funny. Partly this is because the filmmakers seem
uncertain about whether they're making a satire or a serious movie, and so
the jokes just cease while they go about advancing the plot. And partly 
this is because the raunchy humor is such a poor fit with the general
attitude of the picture. Several jokes aroused only uncomfortable chuckles
from the audience during the screening I attended, accompanied by much
squirming and shifting in the seats. Scenes in which the cheerleaders
parade about in their underwear, or one in which a male cheerleader
"inadvertently" lets his fingers slip while holding up a pantie-less
female cheerleader, sit uncomfortably next to the simple moralising of
Jessica Bendinger's screenplay.
Indeed, "Bring It On" feels like a movie which underwent a major rethink
halfway through production. I'm not sure if it started out as a sharp
pastiche on cheerleading which was subverted into something more
homogeneous, or if it was originally just a standard kids' movie
later spiced up to bring in the adults. Without a doubt, I would have
preferred either to the end result.
To be fair, there are some good moments. For example, a sequence in which
a desperate Tor hires a professional choreographer to discipline her
troupe is a lot of fun, as the dancer (Ian Roberts) proceeds to tear apart
each and every member of the Rancho Carne squad. Dunst manages to preserve
her natural charm despite the poor quality of her material. She makes a
real effort here, but she's fighting an uphill battle and just can't make
the movie succeed on her own. Dushku is also very good, although the
script never really finds anything for Missy to do after her introduction
as a rebellious gymnast. She spends the rest of the film acting like
Dunst's shadow, the third wheel in the romantic subplot involving Tor and
Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).
Less laudable is the movie's treatment of the East Compton squad. Their
appearances are so brief that none of them benefit from any character
development whatsoever, not even Gabrielle Union's Isis. This is
unfortunate because when she is on screen, Union demonstrates a real
presence, and I was hoping to see more of her. Further, the flimsy
portrayal of the East Compton troupe ensures that their rivalry with the
Rancho Carne cheerleaders is all but devoid of tension or excitement. It
is difficult for the audience to get excited about a competition when one
side is virtually unknown.
Also unimpressive is Peyton Reed's pedantic direction. Whereas movies of
this sort often excel at showcasing their subject material, if nothing
else ("Center Stage"'s exposure of ballet is a good recent example),
"Bring It On" does cheerleading no real favours. Despite the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast, their routines are filmed in a dull and
commonplace manner. As much time is spent on sending up the sport as it
is on portraying the real trials and tribulations it incurs. There is
little in "Bring It On" to suggest that cheerleaders are, as Roberts'
choreographer puts it, anything other than "dancers who have gone
retarded".
An ill-conceived motion picture from start to finish, "Bring It On" is one
of those rare films which isn't just dull or insipid, but is occasionally
embarrassing to watch. Only some lively performances save this from the
scrap heap of the truly dreadful. "Bring It On"? Do us all a favour --
please, don't.

Bring It On (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4.. Starring Kirsten Dunst, Eliza
Dushku, Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. Written by Jessica
Bendinger. Directed by Peyton Reed. Rated PG-13.
 Probably the one saving grace of "Bring It On" is its sincerity.
 After all, this is a story about cheerleaders - usually a target of
cinematic ridicule - and their struggles to make it to the national
championships in Orlando, Fla.
 Admittedly, the plot isn't "War and Peace." This is just a silly,
formulaic movie with stock characters who are pretty to ogle.
 The photography is well lit, the film's score is bouncy and the cast
plays it straight. It avoids the pitfalls of tackiness and sexism.
 The story centers around the Rancho Carne High School cheerleading
squad in San Diego. The squad has won the national championship five
consecutive years. Now, under the leadership of newly appointed captain
Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), the Toros squad will shoot for title
No. 6.
 But Torrence makes a disturbing discovery. The squad's routines had
been stolen from the Clovers, a hip-hop squad from East Compton, by the
Toros' former captain.
 Thus Torrance must create enough confidence in herself and her squad's
abilities to devise all new routines to carry them to the championship.
 Meanwhile Isis (Gabrielle Union), the driven captain of the Clovers,
must concoct a way for her squad to raise money to attend the nationals
so they can gain the recognition they so richly deserve.
 "Bring It On" does have a certain innocent charm to it, despite its
PG-13 rating. The sexual innuendo is limited to the cheerleading
routines.
 The movie's main flaw is that most of the characters, especially the
Toros girls, are types.
 But this is not the fault of the performers, but of writer Jessica
Bendinger.
 Dunst, who made a startling film debut in "Interview With the Vampire,"
and since then has gone on to do fine work in such films as "Little
Women," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" and the made-for-cable drama "Devil's
Arithmetic," is smart, honest and inventive as Torrance.
 the school has no gymnastics program. Dushku, best known for her role
as Faith in WB's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," plays Torrance's new best
friend who opens her eyes to the Toros' former captain's perfidy.
 Acting honors, though, go to Union as the tough, self-sufficient Isis
who fights to bring her squad to the nationals.
 "Bring It On" is very lightweight fare. Honestly, who takes
cheerleading - or cheerleaders - seriously. The good folks at Universal,
though, in trying to emphasize the importance of cheerleading enclosed a
fact sheet in the press kit that includes a list of famous people who
were cheerleaders. Among the names, Madonna, Kathie Lee Gifford, Donna
Rice, Alicia Silverstone, Meryl Streep, Paula Adbul, Halle Berry and
Sheryl Crow.
 Come on, studio folks. It's only a movie - loud, colorful, but
feathery, with limited appeal for those who believe cheerleading is the
alpha and omega of their existence.

 It's not all pirouettes and posing for the razzle-dazzle
pom-pom squad! Cheerleading is competitive and this exuberant teen
comedy never lets you forget it. Kirsten Dunst plays the perky,
newly-elected captain of the Toro cheerleading squad of Rancho Carne
High School in San Diego. It's a prestigious position since the
squad's won the national championship for five years and is heading
for its sixth trophy. That is until Dunst befriends a transfer student
(Eliza Dushku) and her brother (Jesse Bradford) and discovers that the
Toro's perfectly-choreographed routines were, in fact, stolen by the
ruthless former captain (Lindsay Sloane) from the Clovers, a hip-hop
squad from East Compton. A visit to that inner-city school confirms
the theft and the ire of the understandably angry captain (Gabrielle
Union) of the African-American team that's also taking part in the
upcoming national championships in Daytona.  It gets kind of awkward
and rah-rah rough here as Dunst laments, "My whole cheerleading career
is based on a lie." But Dunst is a good enough comedienne to carry it
off, gamely switching moods with a mischievous myriad of
expressions. Written by Jessica Bendinger and directed by Peyton Reed,
it's a silly, slangy and ultimately conventional spoof, touring the
girls' locker room with an unusual skirmish involving
teeth-brushing. No doubt, cheerleading is a sport that requires
discipline, timing, strength, and concentration but that and the edgy,
moral racial angle is neither emphasized nor deeply explored here, nor
was it part of the trailer. Instead, the racial tension arises
unexpectedly. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bring It On" is
a bouncy, energetic 4, filled with gymnastics, dance and PG-13 sex
appeal.  As Dunst says: "This is not a democracy - it's a
cheerocracy."

The Toro cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High School is at the top of the
game. The six-time national champions have a new captain, Torrance Shipman
(Kirsten Dunst), and it looks like they are on their way to a seventh. Until,
that is, Torrance learns that the Toro's kick-ass routine is stolen from another
cheerleading squad, the Clovers, leading to a moral dilemma for the new team
leader in "Bring It On."
The world of cheerleading at the national competitive level has never, as far as
I know, been the subject of a feature film. The picture that comes to my mind
when I hear the word "cheerleader" harkens back to my days in high school (many
moons ago) when the 'leaders were pretty, stuck up chicks who had their
exclusive clique and ignored everyone who didn't belong. (OK, so I was a shy kid
who didn't too well with girls back then.) Tyro helmer Peyton Reed and
first-time screenwriter Jessica Bendinger shatter that image with a neatly done
moral teenage tale about competition, honor and integrity. Winning isn't
everything in "Bring It On," but honesty and fair play are.
The story, extensively researched by Bendinger, has a notable lack of parental
involvement in the cheerleading lives of the principles. This is actually a
strength breathe of fresh air for the film, with Torrance and rival team captain
Isis (Gabrielle Union) acting out of dedication and love for their sport, not
out of some pressure by mom or dad. I call cheerlead competition a sport
because, at the regional and national level, you are looking at kids who have
trained as hard as any other athlete and are the best in combining gymnastic
skill and dance choreography. I knew nothing about the whole cheerleading thing
going in to "Bring It On." Afterward, I did a little research and talked with
parents of cheerleaders. I was assured that the movie, as I described it, has
the ring of authenticity.
The moral nature of the script builds very strong characters in Torrance, Isis,
and the others. Kirsten Dunst does a fine job as the newly elected captain who
learns from transfer student Missy (Eliza Dushku) that Torrance's champion
cheerleading squad has been gaining kudos by using stolen material. It turns out
that the Toro's former captain Big Red (Lindsay Sloane) had surreptitiously
videotaped a rival team, the Clovers from Compton High, and homogenized the hip
hop routine for the more white bread Rancho Carne High School squad. Not
believing that her team's success is based on theft, Torrance agrees to go see
the Clovers with Missy.
Torrance is stunned by the blatant rip-off of the other team's excellent
performance. The Clovers are every bit as good as the Toros, but their economic
circumstances in their blue-collar neighborhood has kept them from competing at
the regional and national level. When Isis confronts Torrance and accuses her of
being another spy for the Toros, the right-minded Torrance insists that her team
completely redo their routine with only six weeks to the nationals, causing a
rift in team spirit. Meanwhile, she coaxes her father (the only time parents
show up to any degree and they just to fork out money) to collect the funds
needed to bring the Clovers to the nationals, too. (In an inexplicable move,
Isis tears up the from-the-heart check and the Clovers get to the big show by
other means. I thought that the heartfelt and meaningful gesture by Torrance was
unnecessarily snubbed.)
The Toros go through the painful exploration of reinventing their performance,
going to the expensive pains of hiring a choreographer, Sparky Polastri (Ian
Roberts), who turns out to be a con artist selling the same cheer routine up and
down the California coast. Of course, just when she is at the end of her rope,
Torrance is inspired by Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford), the romantic
interest the pretty team captain keeps denying exists, and a new cheer routine
is born. Once all these ends are tied together, the big finale at the nationals
kicks into gear. I won't discuss the outcome, but it is one heck of a bang for
the little movie.
The kids surrounding the principal characters get a chance to flesh out their
own characters, if only a little bit. Eliza Dushku ("True Lies") plays the part
of Torrance's conscience as she points out the fraud of their routine. She
sticks by Torrance when she knows her new friend will do what is right. Jesse
Bradford ("King of the Hill") is good looking and has the presence to provide
the almost unnecessary, but obligatory, romantic interest. Members of the music
group Blaque - Natina Reed, Shamari Fears and Brandi Wiiliams - are very cool
and talented as the key members of the Clovers, giving attitude to the Toros and
rightfully so. Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback, as Courtney and Whitney, are
the dim-bulb stereotype Rancho Carne High squad members, but their pride in
being dumb but pretty and popular has a certain charm.
There are a number of teams and routines shown during the competition sequences
and they are uniformly exciting with energy and fine choreography. The
filmmakers and the kids on the screen make what is very hard look easy and
graceful. Cheers to dance master Nancy Rae Stone and cheerleading choreographer
Ray Jasper for their fine contribution to a good teen flick.
As you'd expect, it all comes down to the best team winning, but "Bring It On"
stresses that it is the healthy competition and desire to do one's best for self
and team that count. And don't go thinking that the sport of cheerleading is all
girls. The press material states that "97% of all cheerleaders are female,
however, 50% of all collegiate cheerleaders are male." When a youngster gets to
that level - the best of the high schoolers are shown here - the athletic
abilities and physical strength of a guy is an absolute necessity in pulling of
the remarkable tosses and flips they do. This is a good date flick for older
teens and a good roll model movie for younger girls.
"Bring It On" doesn't preach political correctness, just a good moral tale of
right versus wrong and why doing the right thing is necessary. If kids are
raised believing these simple, but important, concepts then the world will
indeed be a better place. It's nice to see a well-crafted, thoughtful film that
shows what kids are like at their best. I give it a B.

   Who needs to be dependent on the rest of the world for our
oil or worry about the sluggishness of electric cars or the
expense and impracticalities of solar energy?  Hell, all we
have to do is to bottle the energy exhibited by the young
women in Peyton Reed's "Bring It On" and we could run our
cars for the next ten years without needing another burst of
puissance.  
   Since this picture will considered by some to be another
one of those allegedly dumb high-school exploitation movies
dumped by the studios during the dog days of August, I 
checked the comments of the critics and the youngsters alike
as we were leaving the New York theater where a screening
took place.  The high-school kids were mumbling "same ol'
same ol'" and "predictable" and "trots out every cliche in the
teen books," the sophisticated critics who have been
reviewing movies since the Jurassic Age were trotting out
cheerful news like "A lot of fun!" and "Just what we needed,"
while I piped up with "Boy, am I glad that the French movie
with the talking heads never arrived at the screening room so
I could head over to see this one instead."  "Bring It On"
exudes some of the most boundless energy I've seen since
the last Jackie Chan flick.
     How you feel about this movie may depend on your
response to Nicholas Hytner's recent "Center Stage," about
the world of dance--not just ballet, but also salsa, modern,
jazz and aerobics.  To me that was an altogether refreshing
adventure filled with the vigor that makes Hollywood the envy
of world cinema.  To some people whom I'd consider dead
from the neck down, that film was an example of how "Hytner
has prostituted himself with banalities."  I remember one
guy's saying, "I just can't get interested in a movie if I
don't get into the story."  
   But while some movies are plot-driven--the sort that
comprise the most popular films worldwide--others are
character-driven, and yet others, like "Center Stage" are
music-and-dance propelled.  You could call "Bring It On" an
example of a music-and-dance propelled because despite
what some of us think about cheerleading (especially if we
went to high school and college decades ago), the women
and men today are a far cry from the "Fight fiercely, Harvard"
types that went through their ordinary motions way back
when.  In fact "Bring It On" takes us to the world of high
school talent who are competing in regional and national
championships of cheerleading, participating in a sport to
them--and to many in the audience--that is more important
than the football games to which they are usually mere
backdrop.
   "Bring It On" centers on Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst)
who has just been elected captain of her high-school
cheerleading squad, to the dismay of her opponents and
ultimately to the disgust of the retiring captain.  What
Torrance does not realize is that while the judges at the
competitions rate originality highly, the captain of last year's
team actually stole all of the steps and techniques from a
razzle-dazzle group in a mostly African-American school, the
Clovers, especially from their captain, Isis (Gabrielle Union). 
Fortunately, Torrance's team eventually proves able to
choreograph its own steps largely with the help of a first-class
gymnast, Missy (Eliza Dushku), who had just moved into the
community together with her handsome, guitar-playing
brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).  
   While a couple of the critics who had seen this movie at
test screenings complained that scripter Jessica Bendinger
trots out cliches that were dated even twenty years ago,
including some homophobic commentary, the dialogue is no
way the movie's strong point anyway.  We've got to write off
the narrative and simply sit back in utter amazement at the
vigor, the animations, the unstoppable nervous energy of
Kirsten Dunst's troupe and particularly Ms. Dunst's own
charisma both as a terpsichore of the football field and a
radiant personality that will obviously fall for the new guy in
town.  Her conflict with the African-American captain, Isis,
who resents the theft of her entire performance moves by this
rich, white-girl troupe, is of course going to be followed by a
sentimental mending of the ways.  
   But what the heck.  If you're like me and you had to put up
with the most insipid cheerleading imaginable while sitting in
the grandstands warming up with your flask of bourbon, this
movie will show you why young or old, it's better to be young.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

I grew up in a family that didn't recognized Elvis Presley as the King
of Rock Ân' Roll.  A day or two after Elvis died, I remember asking my
dad who the new King would be, assuming it would be something like
naming a new Pope.  He snorted and said `It's still Dylan,' before
walking off and muttering something about Elvis stealing the black man's
music.  It's the kind of thing that sticks in a little kid's mind.
Bring It On invokes a similar theme of white people ripping off ideas
from black people.  Only instead of music, it's high school cheerleading
routines.  And the white devils almost got away with it, too.
Kirsten Dunst (Virgin Suicides) stars as Torrance Shipman, a senior at
Rancho Carne High.  As the film opens, Tor has a nightmare about
appearing before the entire student sans clothes.  It's no wonder Â the
perky student has a lot on her plate.  Her boyfriend is leaving for
college, her mom keeps preaching the importance of concentrating on
schoolwork, and she just became captain of the school's five-time
national champion cheerleading squad.
The apparent victim of an ancient cheerleading curse, Tor's first day as
captain involves the serious injury of one of the squad's integral
members.  Her leadership is called into question by two bitchy
classmates who accuse Tor of acting like a `cheertator' simply because
she insists on holding tryouts for the opening on the prestigious team.
The audition uncovers a amazing find Â a transfer student named Missy
(Eliza Dushku, Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who wants to join
the team because Rancho Carne doesn't have a gymnastics program.  More
importantly, Missy has a hot brother (Jesse Bradford, A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries).
Tor's curse continues at the squad's first practice with Missy, when the
transfer student drags her captain to watch a cheerleading troop in East
Compton.  Apparently, the former Rancho Carne captain had been stealing
cheers and routines from this under-funded school and presenting them as
her own.  The truth was never discovered because the East Compton school
could never afford to attend the state tournament.  The revelation
caused the crushed Tor to exclaim, `My whole cheerleading career has
been a lie!'
Bring It On's trailer makes the film seem like it's going to be an
un-politically correct battle against a white and black, but most of the
film focuses instead on Tor's desperate attempts at creating a decent
routine on her own.  There's a lot of witty banter and slang that
reminded me of Clueless (like when Tor announces that Missy is `the
Poo'), and the film reaches its inevitable conclusion at the
Cheerleading Championships in Daytona.
Sure Â a lot of Bring It On doesn't make sense (why would Rancho Carne
bother participating in the state finals when they automatically qualify
for nationals as the defending champs?), but the film is funny enough to
make you not bother caring.  It's full of well-choreographed dance
numbers that put the crappy waltzes in Love's Labour's Lost to shame.
Bring It On is the directorial debut of Peyton Reed, who has directed
some of television's best comedy shows (Upright Citizens Brigade, Mr.
Show).  The script is from another first-timer (Jessica Bendinger) and,
while it isn't a great triumph in filmmaking, I thought the little
things added to the screenplay added greatly to the overall experience
(like the fact that Rancho Carne means, literally, `Meat Ranch').  Stick
around for the closing credits and several decent outtakes.

Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is a high school senior, facing a few 
problems. First, she has just become the new captain of her cheerleading 
squad. That's a problem because most of the team doesn't want her there, and 
she has quite a legacy to live up to since the former captain led the team 
to five straight championship victories. She's also having problem with her 
boyfriend, who just went off to college. While he's away, she starts eyeing 
a new student, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), whose sister, Missy (Eliza Dushku), 
is the latest addition to the cheerleading squad. Her last problem is her 
most severe. Torrance just found out that all the team's cheers have been 
stolen from a neighboring, urban school's team. That school, called the 
Clovers, is finally sending its team to the championship, and Torrance needs 
a new cheer so she won't be stealing. With only a few weeks till the 
championship, Torrance has to find a solution to all three of her problems, 
or quite cheerleading for good.
Did that sound just a little cheesy to everyone? I thought so too. I usually 
don't do this, but I thought I'd better warn everyone that this review 
contains at least one statement that might be viewed as a spoiler. "Bring it 
On" bills itself as a comedy; but since there's only one funny scene in the 
film, it's more akin to a... well, it has elements of an... umm. Oh forget 
it, I'm not sure just what "Bring it On" was supposed to be, and I'm not 
entirely sure Peyton Reed knew what he was trying to make either. I suppose 
this is just another movie which can be added to the ever growing list of 
teen films (a genre I detest more and more with each passing week). In other 
words, "Bring it On" is a cliched, predictable movie which appeals only to 
those who understand high school lingo (I didn't even understand high school 
lingo when I was in high school). If you enjoy these sorts of teen movies, 
you should have a blast. The rest of you will either be bored stiff or 
violently ill (I hadn't eaten, so I was only bored stiff). Actually, the 
only reason I was talked into seeing this movie was because I was curious 
how Bendinger would write an ending that would avoid being both cliched and 
politically incorrect. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised at the 
cliched, politically correct finale. I'll give you two guesses who wins, but 
you're only going to need one.
I seem to be one of those strange people who can't understand this Kirsten 
Dunst craze. I'm sorry, but in my opinion, the girls simply cannot act. She 
either overdoes it, like she does in this and in the overrated "Dick"; or 
she under plays it like she did in "The Virgin Suicides". Her supporting 
cast doesn't offer much in the way of help, with nearly everyone turning in 
performances that never rise above mediocre. The only exception is Eliza 
Dushku (television's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), playing the team's newest 
member. While I never thought of Dushku as much of a talent when she first 
showed up on "Buff", I'm forced to admit that her acting abilities have 
improved considerably, and she turns in such a good performance in "Bring it 
On" that she nearly makes the film watchable. However, close only counts in 
horseshoes and handgrenades. One good performance can seldom hold a movie 
afloat when surrounded by bad performances. When it's surrounded by such 
performances and used in a poor script, it's lost amidst the rabble.
I suppose I could be mistaken about how funny "Bring it On" actually is. 
There were two teenage boys a few rows behind me who were laughing so hard I 
thought I was going to have to call an ambulance. The thing that confused me 
is what they were laughing at. Tell me, do you find the word "fag" funny? 
I'm sure a few of you said yes. Okay, do you find the word "fag" funny after 
it has been used about two dozen times? If so, "Bring it On" is just the 
movie for you. The film's jokes never rise above that level of humor, except 
in the one, truly funny scene of the film. When Torrance's team calls in a 
special cheerleader trainer named Sparky (newcomer Ian Roberts), it leads to 
a hysterical five minute scene. Sparky decides to bring his own brand of 
cheerleading to the group, and puts the team on a special training program. 
This includes putting all the girls on diets because, as he says, "You girls 
are being thrown in the air, and you can't throw fat people as high." He 
also proceeds to go through each girl in the class and tell them all their 
faults (in great detail, when discussing the size of one girl's rear end). 
The scene only lasts five minutes, but you'll get more laughs in those few 
minutes than you will at the rest of the movie (in fact, I didn't get a 
single laugh from the rest of the movie).
One of the biggest problems I had with "Bring it On" was that the entire 
plot about the two teams competing against each other was pointless. That's 
the entire plot though, right? Hardly, since the Clovers team is only in 
about fifteen minutes of the movie. If the film had been about the new 
captain having to whip an out of practice team into shape, maybe there would 
have been something to it. Instead, by featuring a race related contest, 
Benedinger insures that someone is going to be offended, and to be perfectly 
frank, I was. When lines like "You think a white girl could have thought up 
moves like those?" are prominantly featured in a movie, and are then 
tolerated by audiences, I have to wonder at the state of Hollywood. Okay, my 
rant is over with. The soundtrack to "Bring it On" features, get this, 
cheerleading songs. In other words, you've heard it all before, but it's 
still appropriate to the movie. The movie runs only 98 minutes, but feels 
more than a bit longer. I'd recommend "Bring it On" to those of you who 
simply adore both teen flicks and cheerleader outfits (but not if you only 
like cheerleader outfits), and give the movie two and a half out of five 
stars.

"You want it.  I'm hot.  I'm everything you're not," cheerleader captain 
Torrance 'Tor' Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) leads her team in the opening 
cheer in Peyton Reed's BRING IT ON.  Soon thereafter, Tor raises her 
arms to the sky and accidentally drops her top in front of a gym full of 
stunned onlookers.  (We see her from the back.)
With this promising start, the film looked to be another sassy and 
raunchy spoof Å la DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, which skewered the world of 
beauty pageants.  The hilarious DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, which also starred 
Dunst, was one of last year's most underrated comedies.  BRING IT ON, 
however, quickly goes downhill, taking itself too seriously and ladling 
on every clichÃ© in the screenwriter's manual.  
There is a good boy, Cliff Pantone (Jesse Bradford), who is smitten by 
Tor.  She, of course, loves someone else, who is unworthy of her 
affection.  Tor has a smart-aleck brother who is part of her sitcom 
family.  Besides taunting her verbally, her brother jumps in the air so 
that he can break wind right in front of her face.  
Jessica Bendinger's script is rampant with homophobic humor.  "Are you 
trying to tell me that you speak fag?" inquires cheerleader Missy 
Pantone (Eliza Dushku) of her fellow cheerleader, Les (Huntley Ritter).  
"Oh, fluently," Les says with raised eyebrows and a slight roll of his 
eyes.  Whenever the script can't think of anything else humorous, it 
punctuates its sentences with homosexual epithets, figuring its audience 
will always find the word "fag" funny.  
The biggest clichÃ© of all involves the poor black school, Clover, across 
the tracks.  The story's big scandal is that Tor's wealthy school, 
Rancho Carne, stole their cheerleading routine from Clover, a little 
known fact.  Rancho Carne is vying for its sixth national cheerleading 
championship in a row, and the Clovers look to be the squad to beat this 
year.  Poor and willing to lose rather than accept "any handouts", the 
Clovers, nevertheless, appeal to an Oprah-style TV host for funds to 
travel to the nationals.  Their mawkish letter to the host starts, 
"Where we're from, 'cheer' isn't a word you hear often."
There is the obligatory tryout scene in which people do just about 
everything but act like would-be cheerleaders.  Not one of these 
auditions is cute or original.  The movie ends with dull outtakes that 
are so clearly preprogrammed that they aren't really outtakes at all.
Every now and then, the story does have its moments.  Flirting with 
Cliff in the stands at a football game, Tor is accused of having cheer 
sex with him.  You know, like phone sex.  No sooner has the writer 
introduced the idea than she drops it entirely.
At other times, the cheerleaders start to get a little bawdy, but the 
camera cuts away quickly.  The few cheerleading sequences in THE 
REPLACEMENTS are better that all of BRING IT ON.  The former are 
unpretentiously funny, whereas BRING IT ON seems so embarrassed by its 
own basic material that it has to mix in everything from vomit sequences 
to pseudo racial conflicts.
In a movie in which little is fresh, there is one scene which doesn't 
feel borrowed from a dozen other pictures.  With mouths full of 
toothpaste, Tor and Cliff compete at the sink for shiniest teeth and 
most vigorous spitting.  Now that's certainly the start of a romance 
made in heaven.
BRING IT ON runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for sex-related material and 
language and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.

Directed by: Peyton Reed
Teen movies became somewhat bothersome in the past two years, we've had so 
many with "10 Things I Hate About You", "Never Been Kissed", and "She's All 
That" just to name a few, plus three flops that came out this year. The bad 
thing about these films is that they follow the same teen movie routine: Boy 
and girl in high school, boy fights with girl, girl gets mad at boy, boy goes 
to prom and makes up with girl and then a bubble-gum pop song plays at the 
end. I had alot of hope for this movie, and to my surprise I was not 
disappointed. "Bring It On" has a great cast of female characters who bring 
out the clever dialogue in a great fashion. The chemistry they have on-screen 
together is so much fun. 
Torrence Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) has just been elected Head Cheerleader of 
the Rancho Carne High School. Her duty is to make the best squad out there 
and win the National Finals for the sixth time in a row. She has even 
recruited a new cheerleader Missy (played greatly by Elize Dushku), who has 
the moves, looks and attitude all in one. While watching practice Missy 
notices something with the routine they do, and takes Torrence on a ride to 
an inner-city school: East Compton High, where Torrence witnesses that the 
Clovers have the same moves they do, except way better. Torrence learns that 
Big Red, their first head cheerleader had been videotaping these routines and 
copying them and winning the finals. Outraged, Torrence must take her squad 
to new lengths to win this competition, she has to get new moves, new music 
and a new routine. Of course along the way, they have the misadventures any 
cheerleader would have if in this situaton. Totally.
One thing I noticed about "Bring It On" is that it doesn't take itself 
seriously. It's a bright, lightweight, funny teen comedy that any person, 
regardless of age, sex or race can enjoy. It doesn't overly expose young teen 
girls (note that locker room scene) and contains some surprisingly realistic 
moments. The acting especially by Eliza Dushku and Kirsten Dunst is first 
rate for a teen comedy. They bring out their characters with style and seem 
to be having a great time making this movie. The direction by Peyton Reed 
really shows in the cheering scenes, these are some greatly choregraphed and 
directed scenes. 
The cleverly written script was done by Jessica Bendinger is written with 
humor and even heart. At times I found myself almost dancing (almost) in my 
chair due to the fact that this movie is so fun, its almost crazy. However 
aside from the mostly good facts of the film, there is also the bad things. 
#1. Is the predictability, we pretty much know who is gonna win, but if you 
don't know I will not spoil it for you. #2. Is that some of the cheerleaders 
are highly cliched and shown as brainless bimbos (no offense to cheerleaders 
reading out there) and #3. Is the love story that goes on between two of the 
main characters, it was extremely under plotted and would have added a much 
more expansive atmosphere to the movie.
Aside from these flaws, "Bring It On" has more plusses than it does minuses. 
You can't find a teen movie these days that stays close to teen lives, 
especially PG-13 teen movies. The acting, directing and writing is all 
satisfactory and the group 'Blaque' appears on the Clovers squad and they do 
a great job supporting the cast. If your heading out on a movie right now and 
don't know which one to see, if your in the mood for fun see "Bring It On". 
You might be disappointed, but I know I sure enjoyed myself.

Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst, "The Virgin Suicides") thinks her dreams
have been answered when she's chosen as captain of her high school's award
winning cheerleading squad in her senior year.  But newcomer Missy (Eliza
Dushku, "True Lies") clues Tori in - the Toros' routines were all stolen 
from LA's Clovers, an urban squad who intend to challenge Tori's in 
"Bring It On."
"Bring It On" is a strange hybrid of a film - it features the usual, routine
competition-set-against-romance teen story, yet maintains a certain freshness
due to the high-spirited cheerleading choreography, the novelty of presenting
cheerleading as a coed competition sport and the appeal of its cast.  Simply 
put, this is more entertaining than a script (by former Spin magazine and MTV 
News writer Jessica Bendinger) read might indicate.
Tori would seem to have it all when 'Big Red' (Lindsay Sloane) passes down
the captain's mantle.  Immediately, problems begin to mount.  First, a
cheerleader suffers a multiple leg break during Tori's first practice.
Efforts to find a replacement result in the standard tryout montage, with
goth chick Missy, who's only slumming looking for a gymnastics substitute,
being the obvious standout.  Tori faces opposition from catty cheer girls
Courtney (Clare Kramer) and Whitney (Nicole Bilderback), but convincing Missy 
to join the team opens a new world to Tori.  Not only does she discover Big 
Red's underhanded methods of stealing routines, but she gets to know Missy's 
brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford, "The King of the Hill").  Supportive, offbeat 
Cliff will come in awful handy when Tori's off-to-college cheerleading 
boyfriend proves disloyal in more ways than one.
While the script does go through the expected paces, it also features some
offbeat humor (a dream sequence cheer routine delivers a delightfully nasty
message, a flirtatious toothbrushing scene).  The relationship
between Tori and Isis (Gabrielle Union, "Ten Things I Hate About You"),
the rival Clovers captain, is also more nuanced than one would expect from
a teen comedy. We still have to put up with the obvious romantic manipulations,
inconsistently used teenspeak ('She puts the itch in B****') and the de rigueur 
vomit gag, but the actors pull the weak bits up a notch, while making hay
with the more original scenes.
Kirsten Dunst grounds the film with her fresh faced optimism and 'spirit,'
and she gets commendable support from Dushku, the talent with 'tude who's
surprised at her own enthusiasm for cheerleading.  Bradford has the appeal
of Paul Rudd in "Clueless" crossed with a young Ben Chaplin ("The Truth 
About Cats and Dogs") and gives a cheekily offbeat performance.  Kramer 
and Bilderback are fun representing the witchiness/popularity of the sport
with Kramer's Courtney being the squad slut (she doesn't wear panties
beneath her spankies the better to enjoy her stunts with male colleagues) 
and Bilderback finagling to get her talentless sister on board.  Gabrielle 
Union is almost patrician as the urban underdog captain, bringing elegance
and dignity to Isis.  Her squad includes the members of singing group Blaque, 
of whom Brandi Williams stands out most as the rambunctious LaFred.  Ian 
Roberts plays hired choreographer Sparky Polastri like as a tyrannical Bob 
Fosse wannabe.  Cody McMains is realistically obnoxious as Tori's little
brother Justin, believably pulling off the film's requisite fart gag.
Feature debut director Peyton Reed has done an impressive job here, instilling
an inspiring energy level in his film.  The mixture of professional
cheerleaders and actors is seamless (there were 12 coed cheerleaders to
8 actors per squad) and the climatic competition is rousing.  For anyone 
who's never watched a real national cheerleading competition on cable, "Bring
It On" will be a relevation.

Well, surprisingly, there are a lot of things to like about this film. I say
"surprisingly" because I am not a member of the 14-year-old female,
apparent-target audience and yet, I must admit - I had a good time!
Here's why: great pace, good direction (all the actors look good), great
acting by Dunst (as  always), with costars also hoppin', funny script, some
nice cheer action (You know, cheer action is quite impressive in slow mo.
The aerial stuff is phenomenal, would have liked more.), abrasively
enjoyable toothbrushing sequence (like none other I've seen - have I seen
one?), Jesse Bradford's guitar reply to a surprise visit by Dunst, and his
goofy song for her, "I can't stand your cheerleading squad, but I like your
pom poms."
It's pretty much the high school team formula with boyfriend off at college
premise that makes a few (perhaps not breakthrough fresh), but nonetheless
respectable twists. Dunst plays the new cheerleading captain whose worst
nightmare comes true - her squad's routines aren't all original! She teams
up with new rocker from the city to keep the crew psyched and ready for the
cheer championships in Florida.
Here are a couple of the tongue-in-cheek lines that kept this audience
smiling and laughing:
Bradford encouraging his punkster sister to go for the cheer thing, "You get
to yell like you care about something."
Dunst, "This is not a democracy - it's a cheerocracy." Upset members
respond, "And you're not a cheerleader you're a cheertator!"
Also done nicely, not unlike the way cheerleaders might be thought to play
second fiddle to football teams, in this film these roles are reversed; the
jocks are almost a second thought - impotent, bullies at best.
Improvements? Sure, though the militant-cheerographer bit was a good idea
and made this crowd laugh, I felt a better cast actor could have really
rocked the place. Also, Eliza Dushku is introduced into the group as a
leather-wearing/gymnast, sadly, we never see her talents in the competition.
A lull at half-time stunts the awesome momentum created from the start. And
lastly, the film might have benefited from deeper relationships among the
characters (most are playful), instead the mood is kept light from beginning
to end, save for an almost heartfelt moment between Dunst and rival captain
of the Compton team, Gabrielle Union.
Overall, Hurrah for this little film, it's a good time. A strong B+.

     There's a point about 35 minutes into Bring It On where you
suddenly realize you're sitting in a movie theater, watching Bring It
On, wondering exactly how the hell the events in your life conspired to
put your ass in an uncomfortable movie theater seat... to watch Bring It
On.  But soon you give up, knowing there is no answer to this dilemma,
and you resign yourself to watching the next hour of Bring It On,
knowing full well that since it's a PG-13 movie, nothing scandalous is
ever going to happen to make it interesting.
     Going in to this movie, I knew full well it was, well, a movie
about cheerleading, so I wasn't expecting another American Beauty
(which, now that I think of it, was partly about cheerleading, but
anyway...).  Suffice it to say that my expectations were low.  And sure
enough, Bring It On is an utterly vapid film with horrendous character
development, hackneyed dialogue, and a questionable theme.  No surprise
there.  Essentially it is Fame in short skirts.
     The story revolves around an affluent San Diego high school and its
crack cheerleading squad, the Toros, which are led by a girl named
Torrance (Kirsten Dunst).  Torrance is picked to lead the Toros to its
sixth consecutive national cheerleading championship, but tragedy
strikes when she learns their routines have all been stolen from an East
Compton high school troupe, the Clovers, which has moves to spare. 
Eventually, of course, it comes down to Toros vs. Clovers in the
championships.
     The bulk of the film revolves around the Toros trying to come up
with their own moves and hiring a choreographer, an outcast cheerleader
named Missy (Eliza Dushku) who shakes things up, and a mild romance
between Torrance and Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).  While I'm
not sure if Bring It On's tepid, teen-friendly raunchiness is
titillating or disturbing, thank god for the pair of Dushku and
Bradford, who salvage this film with their anti-school-spirit tirades
and actual ability to act.  (On a side note: You will rack your brain to
figure out where you've seen these two actors before, so here are the
answers.  Dushku played Schwarzenegger's daughter in True Lies. 
Bradford played the geeky, youngest hacker Joey in Hackers.)
     But Kirsten Dunst?  Dunst is truly one of the best young actresses
working today and this is the material she has to work with?  Her
character comes off as an imitation of Alyson Hannigan's "Once, at band
camp..." character from American Pie.  Kirsten, you should not be in
movies like this.
     Nearing the finale of Bring It On, I began to fear that the message
of Bring It On was about how affluent white teenagers, if they have
enough determination, can stomp the crap out of underfunded, inner city
teenagers if they put their mind to it.  Fortunately, this is not the
case.  Bring It On is really about how a white teenage girl, if she has
enough determination, can forgo everything else in her life and just
focus on cheerleading, cheerleading, cheerleading.  Now there's a
message.

A fitfully satiric portrait of a California-set high school cheerleading 
squad, Peyton Reed's "Bring It On" is a bubbly, little comedic gem, and 
unexpectedly sharp-witted, to boot. While director Reed and screenwriter 
Jessica Bendinger could have easily made a shallow, annoying bubblegum movie 
about gorgeous, trim pom-pom girls, they have wisely opted to take the high 
road and, not only make a spirited comedy, a sweet romance, and a competitive 
sports flick, but also one which includes a bit of wise social commentary. 
At Rancho Carne High School, the peppy cheerleading squad, the Toros, have 
won the national championships for five years in a row. This year, however, 
things are taking a turn for the new, as previous captain of the squad, 
nicknamed Big Red (Lindsay Sloane), has passed her exclusive reign over to 
Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), a committed senior who has devoted her high 
school years to becoming the best cheerleader possible. With an unsupportive, 
cheating boyfriend (Richard Hillman) and academics not being her strongest 
suit, cheering has aided Torrance in connecting to her high school 
experience, and helped her to fit in in a place where she otherwise might not 
have. Because she is now the captain of the squad, Torrance feels obligated 
not to let anyone down.
While holding tryouts, Torrance finally finds a person to fill the last 
vacant slot in Missy (Eliza Dushku), a straight-talking new girl in town who 
does a killer backflip and informs everyone right off that, since the school 
doesn't offer gymnastics, cheering was a last resort. When Missy takes one 
look at their routines, however, she realizes that, for the last five years, 
the supposedly inventive Toros have been stealing their routines from the 
inner city school of East Compton High, who have what it takes to go to 
nationals, but have never had the money. When Torrance is taken by Missy to 
witness their own thievery first-hand, she is shocked and disappointed, 
immediately becoming determined not to let this stop her from making things 
right for the East Compton Clovers and their headstrong captain Isis 
(Gabrielle Union), and bouncing back with a fresh routine that is just as 
good, if not better, than their plagiaristic old ones.
"Bring It On" is the latest entry in the increasingly weary "teen" genre, so 
it comes as a surprise to find that, with zippy, highly energetic pacing, and 
a group of talented actors who excel in their potentially two-dimensional 
roles, this is one of the better movies of its type all year. While falling 
into the usual pits of the "teen" movie (its occasional predictability and 
overall cliches), there are several aspects of "Bring It On" that make it 
rise above the average muck:
#1: The Writing. With acerbic, witty dialogue, "Bring It On" holds the 
distinction of having some of the most memorable dialogue in a teen film 
since 1999's sparkling "Election." While funny and usually keeping in tone 
with the generally lighthearted nature of the picture, screenwriter Bendinger 
also stays fairly accurate in her portrayal of the characters, none of whom 
are perfect, and each of which have flaws and a remaining hint of immaturity 
about them, as all 17-year-olds normally do.
#2: The Acting. Ever since her superb acting debut in 1994's "Interview With 
the Vampire," Kirsten Dunst has been a young star on the rise. But not to 
shortchange her by referring to her as merely a "star," Dunst is also a true, 
top-of-the-line actress who chooses smart roles in diverse projects. Dunst's 
Torrance may be a teenage girl (and an unusually realistic one), but she also 
has a firm head on her shoulders, and realizes the difference between right 
and wrong. Extra points must be given for her strong will; Torrance could, in 
fact, pose as a model for feminine empowerment everywhere. All other central 
performances are undoubtedly just as good, from Eliza Dushku (TV's "Buffy"), 
as Missy; to the magnetic Jesse Bradford (1993's "King of the Hill") as 
Missy's alternative brother Cliff, who catches Torrance's eye; to Gabrielle 
Union (1999's "10 Things I Hate About You"), as the no-nonsense Isis.
#3: The Outcome. While most teen flicks can have their whole endings 
telegraphed far in advance, the climax of "Bring It On," set at the nationals 
competition, is not only stunningly choreographed (the actors clearly had to 
learn the routine and perform most of it themselves), but also relatively 
suspenseful, as it is impossible to predict whether the Toros or the Clovers 
will come out on top. For once, we have a pseudo-sports movie that actually 
attempts to be a little different, and doesn't place its bets solely on one 
team.
Joyfully entertaining and brightly filmed with an appropriate palette of 
sunny colors, "Bring It On" is, behind its potentially vapid exterior, a very 
smart movie with a lot of heart. If anything, director Reed knew exactly how 
to sell his film to me, once and for all, by tacking on a musical rendition 
of the '80s pop classic, "Mickey," lip synched by the whole cast, during the 
end credits. How could you possibly go wrong with a slam-bang conclusion like 
that?

BRING IT ON is CLUELESS for those who felt that particular movie was too 
leisurely paced. Akin to much of the current teen dribble being ladled on 
audiences like so much cheese, it moves at a rapid MTV-ized pace, its camera 
hardly able to keep up with the fast walking pretty actors as they speedily 
deliver the latest (stylized) teen lingo ("Dyke-a-delic!" a teen princess 
squeals). And it's one of those flicks where every scene commences with the 
blasting of some current top 20 hit, its volume rising depending on the tenor 
of the scene, or some times just rising for the sheer hell of it. Like most 
teen-pop fairy tales it takes place in a posh high school that looks more 
like a heavenly resort than even the ritziest private school. And it happens 
to be populated by a gaggle of muscular, runway-ready hunks and obviously 
silicon-enhanced honeys. Come as it has during the dog days of August, BRING 
IT ON may just be the best back to school commercial ever made. But as a 
feature length film its merits are more questionable.
The flick centers on the trials and tribulations of a cheerleader squad 
populated by the usual sexy, valley girl\porn star types. Meaning that all 
major set pieces revolve around hyperbolic cheerleading routines in which the 
girls smile brightly and cartwheel about, hinting, not so subtly, at their 
coquettish sexuality while pulsating techno and alterna-rock attempt to 
energize the audience into feeling somethingâ¦anything. 
(Am I the only one who finds cheerleaders a bit on the creepy side? 
With their false ear-to-ear grins and programmed sunny disposition they 
remind me of female clowns, manic-expressives not so much having a good time 
as laboriously trying to create the illusion of F-U-N) 
BRING IT ON reminds me of one of those 70's Roger Corman exploitation pics 
(BIG DOLL HOUSE, CANDY STRIP NURSES) but unlike those this one finds itself 
confined to a PG-13 rating, though it obviously would prefer to be R. 
Included are several scenes that feel very soft core pornish. There's one in 
which the bikini-clad cheerleaders sexily grind up against cars, soap 
dribbling from their taut flesh, sexual innuendoes involving antennas abound, 
in other words, a bikini car wash scene approved to unspool before the glazed 
eyes of many thirteen year old boys.
Much like most of the Corman pictures, BRING IT ON even tries to sneak in a 
bit of a social message amidst all that jiggling. We find that the bratty, 
affluent (read: white) cheerleaders have been stealing routines from a bunch 
of tough, inner city (read: black) cheerleaders. As is to be expected this is 
embarrassingly explored with even less insight than one would find in an 
average AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL, but I suppose the movie had to be about 
something.
BRING IT ON demonstrates to us cynical types that cheerleaders have 
consciences too, with its plucky heroine, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst playing a 
bright eyed combo of her dopey teen caricatures in DICK and DROP DEAD 
GORGEOUS) scrunching up her face and exclaiming "It just isn't right!" No it 
isn't, and this bleeding heart even goes out of her way to make things right 
by pleading to her well-off father to puhleeze sponsor the inner city 
cheerleaders for the inevitable cheerleading competition (wonder of wonders, 
such a thing really exists), victory be damned. 
A myriad of sub plots find themselves scrunched in between all the mid-riff 
baring; Eliza Dushku (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER; the show, not the movie) is 
the sarcastic rebel chick who shows up at the very end of one of those goofy 
[cheerleading] audition scenes where each candidate is more inept and 
clueless than the proceeding one. Dushku is, at first, sniveled at for her 
punky appearance but she regales the crowd by leaping and flipping like a 
deft ninja. Despite the show she puts on, the preppy cheerleaders still hate 
her, but nonetheless let her into their little cult, for it would be plain 
rah-rah retarded to deny her Olympic-like athletic ability. She has a 
brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford, giving us little more than a slanted smile) 
who cozies up to Torrance in the film's second best scene which has them 
brushing their respective teeth in unison, bizarrely trying to one-up each 
other with the amount of foamy toothpaste they can spit up. 
The best scene is the one where, after reluctantly hiring a choreographer, 
they meet the psycho. Played with sniveling malice by Ian Roberts, the guy is 
like a wacky drill instructor, barking orders and insults ("Cheerleader's are 
dancers gone retarded") rather than offering anything resembling guidance. 
Roberts is so good, he just about steals the movie in only about seven 
minutes of screen time. That should virtually guarantee him some odd MTV 
MOVIE AWARD nomination. 
At the center of it all is Kirsten Dunst, who I've liked before. Here she 
comes across as something of a young, sickly sweet (and phony) Kathie Lee 
Gifford and that's not a good thing. I'd call her caricature clever if I 
wasn't so damn annoyed by how one-dimensional it is. Better is Eliza Dushku, 
the cynical one, who at least doesn't call attention to herself. Most of the 
cast seems to have learned their acting style from repeated viewings of SAVED 
BY THE BELL, which actually serves them just fine in a picture such as this. 
By the end, at the aforementioned cheerleading competition, the film has 
degenerated into a series of interchangeable routines, made even more 
interchangeable by the director's constantly flinching camera; the entire 
finale looks like a cut and paste job. And then there are the victors who 
should be fairly obvious once you realize the film is as guilty and liberal 
as its impossibly pert heroine. But the film makers sure try hard, giving us 
some fun teen dialogue ("Do you speak fag?"), a bit of unnecessary projectile 
vomiting (I thought SCARY MOVIE was supposed to be next door) and a 
surprisingly well placed fart gag. Roger Corman would have a ball. As would 
his grand kids.

If you're going to make a comedy about teens you really have to keep it 
satirical enough from expecting us to take the characters and their 
situations seriously. All the battles of the cliques and the who-likes-who 
subplots aren't exactly original or taxing on the intellect. "Bring It On" is 
a teenage comedy that half realizes this. It's got campiness to it but not as 
much a it needs to keep it fluffy and tongue-in-cheek. It's difficult to tell 
what's supposed to be taken seriously and what's not. 
The setting is a high school outside of San Diego where mostly rich white 
preppy kids live. The Ranche Carne Toros are a lousy football team but they 
boost the best cheerleading squad in the country and they have the trophies 
to proove it. As the film opens the out-going captain "Big Red" passes the 
torch to her successor - Torrance - a cute blonde with a lot of ambition but 
little brains played by Kirsten Dunst (the teenage Cameron Diaz). 
Torrance is the least stuck-up and snobby of the cheerleaders and she decides 
to hold an audition for a vacant spot instead of just giving it to one of the 
other cheerleader's little sister. There's a funny sequence of kids trying 
out for the team that don't know what they're doing which proceeds to 
introduce the next major character, Missy. She's a gymnastics expert who 
doesn't really want to do cheerleading but it's as close to a gymnastics 
work-out she can find. She's very rebellious-looking with braids and all dark 
makeup so not surprisingly the other girls hate her but Torrance sees 
something in her and lets her join. 
The conflict soon crops up when Missy accuses Torrance of ripping off their 
cheers from a school in East Compton. The two even drive over 100 miles to 
L.A. to see for themselves and nearly get pummelled when the all-black 
"Clovers" cheerleading squadÂ say they're sick of being spied on and Â having 
their routines ripped-off (by Big Red for years). They'd enter the national 
competition too but their school can't afford to send them. 
And so Torrance and the gang must decide to either stick with the winning 
moves they know how to do, hire a choreographer or make up new routines 
themselves. All three of these scenarios happen, respectively. 
Meanwhile there's a subplot involving Torrance's relationship with her 
boyfriend and another boy named Cliff (Missy's brother) who likes her too. 
The dating triangle starts out cute at first because Cliff's funny and does 
things to make Torrance like him that you usually don't see in teenage 
movies. When he finds out she already has a boyfriend he turns from having a 
crush on her to loathing her which makes Torrance realize she likes him 
better than her boyfriend (when someone DOESN'T like you, that's when you're 
attracted to them?). 
This is what I'm talking about - who cares about this dating triangle stuff? 
It's been used everywhere else, why repeat it? And if so, why make it so 
blatantly obvious and over-the-top about where the relationship is going and 
who's going to wind up with who in the end? 
The screenplay has other problems, mostly in its white guilty feeling. We're 
supposed to pity the East Compton Clovers because they really are a good team 
but don't have the resources to compete nationally. When Torrance hears of 
this she actually gets her father to write a check so they can go. The 
Clovers don't take the check though, instead they write to an Oprah-like talk 
show host and get the money. 
I have a strong feeling the writer of this film is white and has little 
experience in writing for African-American characters. She's trying to play 
the race relations card very P.C.,Â but it's more like pandering to the 
audience. Stereotypes are abundant and they're not necessary at all. 
A lot of people on the Net are already describing "Bring It On" as the 
"Rocky" of cheerleading moviesÂ but that's not a fair description at all. 
Rocky was a poor guy who worked his way up, the Ranche Carne Toros are 
national champions five years in a row and they're going for a sixth - aww, 
the poor rich kids might not become champions again, boo hoo. 
I could point out a lot more flaws but they're all just part of the same 
principle - that these teenagers' challenges and personal lives are taken a 
bit too seriously and the story takes shortcuts wherever it can.
