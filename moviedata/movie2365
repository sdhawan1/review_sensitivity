Unelected President Emerson (Kevin Pollak) and entourage are snowed into a
small town greasy spoon someplace in Colorado somewhere around the year 2008
and a few minutes after Hussein's son decides to blow away the handful of US
peacekeeping troops in Iraq and reinvade Kuwait.
With Timothy Hutton as the president's right hand adviser (and old college
buddy), and Sheryl Lee Ralph as military adviser; Pollak isn't interested in
playing games with this foreign aggression. Remembering Bush's little
escapade with that pesky older Hussein, Pollak cracks, "I'm not gonna just
drop a couple of Tomahawks on Iraq and say 'How do you like dem apples?'"
IBS (the CNN of the future) cut-always fill us (the audience) in on this
president's less than presidential appearance and demeanor at the
culmination of his election campaign. Perhaps motivated by a hidden agenda
or maybe because he's seeking to blow apart his "very second banana" aura,
Pollak plays tough and threatens to drop the big one on Baghdad.
>From there, the film plays like the 60's thriller "Fail Safe" where Henry
Fonda negotiates with the Russian president via telephone while one of our
accidentally launched warheads cruises toward Moscow. That, by the way, is a
pretty good film and similarly thought provoking.
"Deterrence" is a little rough in the launch. In fact, you might suspect the
whole invasion thing to be a hoax (a la, "Wag the Dog"), however, soon
enough the slack in the rope tightens, pulling you in as it holds you tense.
And even though the production never leaves that little diner, the strategic
political and military scenarios, personalities, ethics and personal beliefs
let fly like warheads from around the globe and entangle in a drama rich
enough to fill the screen. Will he really release the first nuke in 60 years
"wiping out a civilization where civilization began?" And if so will the
pilots of that unlucky B2 lose their nerve? "More men have walked the moon
than have done what we're about to do," they reveal to the president over an
unsecured phone-line into the diner, "I guess that's why we get the big
bucks."
Ironically the entertainment arc of this film follows that of a launched
missile. Discussing the ending would defuse the picture, let's just say that
I preferred the over all message of "Fail Safe" to my interpretation of
"Deterrence." But as writer/director Rod Lurie asserts, this is a film open
to many interpretations of which his and mine are only two.

 Deterrence
Rated  [R], 103 minutes
Starring Kevin Pollak, Timothy Hutton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Sean Astin
Written and Directed by Rod Lurie
website: www.deterrencemovie.com
IN SHORT: Great writing and acting almost sabotaged by poor direction
There may be a lot of argument about the politics (perceived or implied)
of Rod Lurie's Deterrence, that's how well written and acted this
nuclear thriller is. Problem is that Lurie has also chosen to direct his
script, and he's much less adept at that chore. We'll present the
positive, first.
Set in Colorado, early in the election year of 2008, Deterrence is a one
set piece in which all the characters remain, hemmed in by an unexpected
blizzard. There's a vacationing couple (Kathryn Morris and Michael
Mantell), whiling away the hours at Morty's Roadside Diner over a game
of chess. There's a local guy named Ralph (Sean Astin), eating a burger
and playing pool. Katie the waitress (Clotilde Courau) is a
French-Canadian import and Harvey (Bajda Djola) is flipping burgers, as
the owner of the joint. The snow continues to fall as the diner fills
with an entourage of suits and ties who can't make it to the local
airport.
That entourage includes the President of the United States, Walter
Emerson (Kevin Pollak), his Chief of Staff Marshall Thompson (Timothy
Hutton) and National Security Advisor Gayle Redford (Sheryl Lee Ralph).
In Colorado to campaign, the President has left it to his men in DC to
monitor a possible military hotspot in the Far East. While the prez sits
down to a chili-burger, Iraq invades Kuwait and massacres an American
military peacekeeping force.
The options are few. Most of our military units are in the Far East. The
one aircraft carrier in the area can launch missiles that can't be
recalled if Iraq doesn't back down to Presidential demands, broadcast to
the world via an IBS (think CNN) camera uplink that had been covering
the campaign. The only option Emerson offers to Uday Hussein, son of
Sadaam, is retreat or see the city of Baghdad nuked off the face of the
earth. The Iraqis, in turn, offer to turn the Western World into toast,
with their own, and unknown to us, collection of nukes. That's all I'll
tell you about Deterrence's greatest strength; a twisting, turning story
that puts two nuclear powers nose to nose on a course towards what we
used to call M.D.A., "mutual assured destruction."
While all the reg'lar folks sound off about the President's threat,
Lurie has tossed in a couple more layers of background intrigue into the
mix. President Emerson like Gerald Ford back in the Seventies, wasn't
elected to office and thus cannot be sure that he has a mandate from the
people to take the route he has chosen, a route his top aides are
strongly opposed to. As the minutes to deadline wear down, so do the
tempers of everyone in the diner. Great performances by Pollak, Hutton
and Ralph in particular kept our attention fixed on the screen at all
times -- when they are on the screen.
To get there you have to suffer through a hackneyed mess of opening
credits and a pointless mix of artsy black and white and color video
images that begin this flick. It's Lurie's lack of training as a
director that is this flick's biggest drawback, and his training is that
of a respected LA based film critic and writer. Assuming that he sat
through the hundreds of flicks the rest of us do, there is almost no
excuse for making the mistakes that he does (and here I'll shift into
film student mode, 'cuz that's the only way to make it clear).
>From year one of film school, (you) are taught three things: Do Not move
the camera unless you're making a point. Do Not fast cut a sequence if
the edits don't enhance the story telling value. Do Not pad your film
with local color above and beyond what is necessary to set up the story
(most of that is in the title sequence. You are advised to go out for
popcorn once the film starts).
One set shoots are difficult enough for an experienced director, but
Lurie shoots everything in close up. It'll look fine on TV. It's
oppressive viewing on the big screen. Deterrence might have been a fine
successor to Fail Safe. It is not.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Deterrence, he would have paid...
Pay per view level. If your tastes run to the arthouse, feel free to
drop the dollar.

   "Deterrence" mines the same fields as "Dr. Strangelove"
but Rod Lurie, who directs and has written his first feature
film, is about as distant from Stanley Kubrick as New York is
from Perth, Australia.  The story takes place in a single room-
-the only "opening up" occurring from file films--and fulfills all
the requirements of a particularly inept off-off-Broadway play:
barely workmanlike actors who look as though they couldn't
make it as waiters, virtually non-existent direction, and a
script that is so ludicrous that the "filmed play" looks more
like William Inge's comedy "Bus Stop" than like Sidney
Lumet's "Fail-Safe."  If you recall Inge's story, a bus out of
Kansas City pulls up at a cheerful roadside diner in the
middle of a howling snowstorm, with all roads blocked as
some weary travelers get set to hole up until the morning
when all hell breaks loose.  If Lurie had billed his movie as a
lampoon, he'd be off the hook.  But if you take a look at his
agitprop statement in the production notes, you might be
appalled at his one-dimensional, simplistic view of America's 
role in the world--all of which comes out in his depiction of a
president who represents the banality of evil.
   Lurie, an Israeli-born American citizen who went to West
Point, now bills himself as pacifistic and somewhat to the left
of center in his politics.  He appears to say in his notes that
Truman's decision to drop the A-bomb on Japan was inspired
by racism, pure and simple, since Japan was about to
surrender imminently with no land invasion by Americans
necessary: that the U.S. used the bomb not just once, but
twice on the Japanese civilians simply to show the Russians
that we had the weapon.  Similarly he believes that President
Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak), Lurie's fatuous creation, feels
little compunction about ordering the nuking of Baghdad
during a crisis since after-all-they're-only-Arabs.  If the acting,
direction and screenplay of "Deterrence" do not strike you as
absurd, perhaps Lurie's simplistic evocation of truth will.  All
in all, the picture is a travesty in every regard.
   The scene opens during a brutal snowstorm in Aztec,
Colorado in the year 2008, the inhabitants of a diner being a
cross-section of Americans.  Enter the president of the United
States (Pollak), his chief of staff Marshall Thompson (Timothy
Hutton), his national security adviser, Gayle Redford (Sheryl
Lee Ralph) and Special Agent Dexter (Ryan Cutrona). 
Trapped by the storm just as the polls close in Colorado's
presidential primary, the president naturally awes the cafe's
denizens, who include the owner, Harvey (Bajda Djola), a 30-
ish married couple, Taylor Woods (Michael Mantell) and
Lizzie (Kathryn Morris), a clueless waitress with a Quebecois
accent, Katie (Clotilde Courau), and redneck Ralph (Sean
Astin).  When Iraqi dictator Udei Hussein takes advantage of
the president's involvement in the primary and of a crisis in
Asia to invade Kuwait once again, President Pollak--a short,
uncharismatic man who had never been elected to the office
but who had taken over from the deceased chief executive--
does not have the manpower to divert to the Middle East to
turn back the invaders.  In the most preposterous decision of
this thoroughly ludicrous story, he ratchets up the ante on the
spot.  If Udei does not --get this--withdraw within two hours
and surrender himself in the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. will drop
a nuclear bomb on Baghdad.  
   Everyone in the audience during the special screening of
this movie was either biting his lip or simply being polite. 
How else to explain the complete absence of uproarious
laughter in the congregation? 
  But that's not all.  Dismissing the advice of his national
security adviser and his chief of staff, the president instead
calls upon the American people, i.e. those middle-Americans
slurping coffee and serving chili in the cafe, to give their
opinions.  With the fate of the world in the balance (since Iraq
has threatened to drop its own recently purchased nuclear
missiles on New York, Sydney, Washington, Tokyo, Tel Aviv
and other Western allies), President Emerson puffs casually
on his cigar, gives a buzz on the pay phone to his wife back
in Washington (who tells him that she will not be his Eva
Braun), and goes on national TV.  He even discusses football
with the pilot of the B-52 which is approaching Iraqi air space.
   Timothy Hutton has been made up to look like "Fail-Safe"'s
Henry Fonda, thereby losing the boyish charm he displayed
so well in "The Substance of Fire."  But the 41-year-old Kevin
Pollak is perfectly cast: he got his start as a stand-up comic
on the San Francisco club circuit.
Rated R.  Running Time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2000

As the introspective President Emerson, Kevin Pollak is stuck in a
blizzard in an out-of-the-way diner in Aztec, Colorado as the voters are
casting ballots in the presidential primary and as the world suddenly
enters the brink of World War III.  Although mocked by television's
talking heads as being not of presidential timber, Emerson is ready to
think the unthinkable and do the undoable, as he announces that he will
drop the atomic bomb on Baghdad in less than 2 hours.
Safe topics for movies these days range from dysfunctional families to
teen comedies.  In DETERRENCE writer/director Rod Lurie tackles a
subject, nuclear war, that has become passé.  With the end of the Cold
War, the world seems ready to forget that nuclear weapons in mass
quantities still exist and that certain rogue states are surreptitiously
adding to their nuclear arsenals.
Although Lurie deserves credit for going where recent filmmakers have
feared to tread, his picture is rife with flaws, so much so that it is
easy to write off the entire film as completely ridiculous.  This,
however, would be a mistake for, whatever its shortcomings, the movie
creates palpable tension and riveting actions.  If one scores the film
like a boxing match, it would most certainly lose on points.  Still, it
will have you glued to your seats even if you are smugly thinking that
this couldn't happen.
Bracketed by archival sound bytes (Johnson's "War is always the same.
It is the young men dying when at the fullness of their promise" and
Roosevelt's "I hate war!"), the message makes the point that throughout
the history of the last hundred years, the United States has abhorred
war while taking whatever military action was necessary.  It is against
that backdrop that the movie should be evaluated.  Although written off
by many as jingoistic nonsense, the movie raises many interesting
questions even with its numerous shortcomings.
What if Kennedy's military intelligence in the Cuban missile crisis had
been wrong, as spying by its nature so often is?  What if Kennedy's
belligerence against the Russians had spooked them into launching
nuclear weapons and taking out major parts of the United States?  Would
history have viewed his administration less like Camelot and more like a
mortuary?  Luckily, we'll never know.  We now know that Kennedy made the
"right" decision in this case.
In DETERRENCE, a fast-moving situation has Saddam's son invading Kuwait
and heading toward Saudi Arabia to take over that country as well.
Moreover, the Iraqis have chemical and biological weapons about to be
launched against the Israelis and others.  (And if this isn't enough,
the North Koreans are continuing in their threat to invade South Korea.)
Finding that he has few options and not wanting to lose Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia and possibly Israel, President Emerson decides to retaliate
forcefully and immediately.  And this is where the movie makes the first
of its many spectacular blunders.  Without consulting with any of his
advisors and without practicing or even outlining his speech, the
president addresses the world on television, saying that, unless Hussein
immediately calls back all of his troops and surrenders himself to the
American Embassy for prosecution, the U.S. will annihilate Baghdad with
an atomic bomb.  This, of course, backs Hussein into a corner in which
his only response could be to thumb his nose at the president.
The situation quickly escalates from bad to worse as nuclear missile
silos all over the world go hot and governments become ready to shoot.
As the cigar chomping president who seems to genuinely like schmoozing
with his constituents, Pollak delivers a subtly nuanced performance.  He
plays a Jewish president who is ready to play nuclear chicken with the
Iraqis.  Tough and resolute, he isn't sure himself whether he's playing
the hand right, but he figures that he has to take the approach that he
has.  Perennial supporting actor Pollak, last seen in THE WHOLE NINE
YARDS, proves that he can carry a movie on his own, even one with a
semi-silly script.
Emerson's advisors, most notably his old college chum Marshall Thompson
(Timothy Hutton), don't agree with his approach.  Hutton, who is called
upon to deliver the movie's most ridiculous speech about how Iraq is the
home of the Garden of Eden, is marvelously slimy.  His only take on
situations revolves around how they will play out in the polls.
Much like a stage play, the movie happens almost entirely in the diner.
This claustrophobic atmosphere, however, works to the advantage of the
story as it heightens the tension.  As people become explosive in the
face of such a crisis, their actions become a bit more understandable.
Although deadly serious, one of the movie's best scenes comes in a
put-down of Ralph (Sean Astin), a local bigot and "taxpayer."  After
Ralph's long, vituperative outburst to the president, Emerson makes him
a promise.  The president will request that Congress grant Ralph
immunity forever from taxes if Ralph agrees never to speak to him again.
Although perhaps just a guilty pleasure, the movie has more than enough
for me to be able to recommend it.  On the other hand, if the
preposterous parts of the body of the story drive you crazy, the ending
will undoubtedly have you going ballistic.
DETERRENCE runs 1:41.  It is rated R for some violence and language and
would be acceptable for teenagers.
