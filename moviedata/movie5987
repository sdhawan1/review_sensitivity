Most of us are familiar with the story of the Three Musketeers, or
rather four. The story of the Man In The Iron Mask, also written by
Alexandre Dumas, takes place 25 years later - our musketeers got
older and each of them is in a different business now. King of France
is no longer Louis XIII but Louis XIV, the man who built Versailles.
But in our story Louis is a spoiled brat, an arrogant adolescent who
only cares about his own pleasure while the people are starving in
the streets of Paris.
D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), Athos (John Malkovich), Porthos (Gérard
Depardieu) and Aramis (Jeremy Irons) all have their own good reasons
to want to get rid of the king. A carefully guarded secret works to
their advantage: Louis XIV has a twin brother who was taken away
right after he was born so as not to endanger the succession. He does
not know about his true identity and has been kept in a dungeon for
the last six years. An iron mask covers his face so no-one will
notice how much he looks like the king. The four musketeers conspire
to exchange Philippe for Louis to free the people of France from
their despotic monarch.
Even if THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK has nothing new to offer this remake
is worth watching, especially because of its top notch cast. The
"elderly gentlemen" seemed to have fun as musketeers. The women's job
in this movie is to look pretty, but that's just the nature of the
story.
Leonardo DiCaprio may be a surprising but nevertheless good choice
for the part of Louis XIV. He masters two very different parts. His
arrogant Louis reminds me of Jaye Davidson as Ra in Roland Emmerich's
STARGATE, but maybe that was just the similar hairdo.
One thing's for sure: There can only be one. It's either Louis or
Philippe, one of them must disappear.
The strangest character in the movie is Gérard Depardieu as Porthos,
although if you know the book you can hardly think of a better actor
for the part. The aging Porthos lost his peace of mind, thinks about
suicide and gets on his friends' nerves. They don't take him
seriously, but still they make a saw-cut in a beam in the barn to
prevent him from killing himself. Why Porthos has to be naked when he
tries to hang himself remains a mystery. Maybe because Depardieu
likes to drop his clothes. That doesn't mean that we all would like
to see him that way. After seeing him climb out of a bathtub in
GERMINAL I decided that I like cave bears better at the museum, but
once more I was given this very special treat. So what.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK isn't very original, but makes for two hours
of pleasant entertainment if you enjoy pretty costumes and don't
expect too much.

Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard

Director: Randall Wallace
Producers: Randall Wallace and Russ Smith
Screenplay:  Randall Wallace based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas
Hollywood has an annoying tendency to transform great classical pieces
of literature into whatever they fancy. If these changes were any good
then perhaps one can say  oh, that was neat; but when they are sloppily
done, one can only grit their teeth, rip at the seating material with
their finger nails and wait for the movie's end.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is by no means a faithful adaptation of the
Alexandre Dumas novel on which it is based. The question is did screen
writer/director newbie Randall Wallace even try to be loyal?
So let's forget about the story for the moment, and focus on the young
star of the moment, Leonardo Di Caprio. Hot off the heels of TITANIC,
this movie vehicle merely cashes in on the enormous popularity generated
from the aforementioned. His performance here merely ranges from pure
pouty (Evil King Louis) to pure innocence (Good Prince Phillipe) with
little in between, so much for dramatic range! He was by far better in
Titanic. Then there are the veterans of stage and screen. Jeremy Irons
(Aramis), very much reprises his priestly persona that worked
brilliantly in THE MISSION. I still can't get over John Malkovich's
awkward American accent as Athos. Fortunately, there is no such
discrepancy between speech and character with Gerard Depardieu. His role
as Porthos, farts and all, is the comic relief in this sullen movie.
Gabriel Byrne an ever reliable actor is the loyal, faithful D'Artagnan
who carries a mysterious secret with him.
Overall, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is mildly entertaining, but not a good
movie by any standard. There are some memorable scenes like Leo Di
Caprio looking his prettiest whilst moon gazing, a damsel in distress
who leaps to her death for selling herself cheap. And when the Four
Muskateers dressed in elegant garb, brandishing swords and fencing side
by side, yell slogans like All for One and One for All'  touching but
hardly the grand Dumas epic it should have been.

     During the heyday of his career as a writer, Alexandre Dumas penned 
three novels about a quartet of the best-known characters in European 
literature:  Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan.  In 1844, Dumas 
published THE THREE MUSKETEERS.  The next year, he followed this with 
TWENTY YEARS LATER.  Finally, between 1848 and 1850, his serialized THE 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK came to print.  Like all the best historical 
fiction, this trilogy uses real characters and real events, but imagines 
and re-invents relationships and circumstances.  The resulting 
narratives are complex and entertaining, featuring ample quantities of 
swashbuckling adventure while focusing on well-rounded characters and 
murky politics.
     While THE THREE MUSKETEERS has been adapted more than a dozen times 
for film and television, this new version of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is 
only the sixth (the last was 1979's THE FIFTH MUSKETEER).  The 
writer/director is Randall Wallace, who scripted BRAVEHEART for Mel 
Gibson.  The problem with this movie is that Wallace has attempted to 
squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture, something that 
can't be done without major sacrifices.  The resulting product is high 
on melodrama and low on the character depth and political machinations 
that are the novel's strengths.  THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is also 
surprisingly devoid of gripping adventure.  Hardly a gun is fired or a 
sword drawn until the climactic half-hour.  
     Although the basic plot follows that of the novel, the central 
characters, older versions of the Four Musketeers, have been simplified 
into generic heroes.  Their motives, as presented in the movie, are 
superficial.  Athos (John Malkovich) has invested all of his hope and 
faith in his son, Raul (Peter Sarsgaard).  Porthos (Gerard Depardieu) is 
enjoying a life of debauched revelry.  Aramis (Jeremy Irons) has become 
the military leader of the Jesuits.  And D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) 
remains the devoted captain of the Musketeers.  The story, which 
transpires in 1662 France, blossoms from a rift that grows between the 
older three men and their former protégé.  D'Artagnan's unquestioning 
loyalty to the cold, self-serving king, Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio), 
places him at odds with Porthos, Athos, and Aramis after the king sends 
Athos' son to the front lines of a battle so that he can woo Raul's 
fiancee, Christine (Judith Godreche).  And there is yet another player, 
the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask, who languishes in prison, his face 
hidden from his captors because of his eerie resemblance to King Louis.
     Dramatically, the film is weak, and plays more like a soap opera 
than a screen adaptation of a classic novel.  The costumes and set 
design are impressive, but they're all just window dressing.  The plot 
has the hit-and-miss feel that one might expect from any attempt to cram 
so much material into such a limited running time.  The political 
background, which includes riots by the starving common people, border 
wars, and religious power plays, is given short shrift  a line or two 
here, a quick scene there.  The characters aren't all that interesting, 
since much of their complexity has been stripped away to make them more 
familiar and appealing to today's movie-going crowd.  (For example, the 
Aramis of the book comes close to being a villain, but the Aramis of the 
movie is unquestionably heroic.)  The unfortunate result is that the 
first 90 minutes, which are primarily intended to be dramatic, come 
across as rather dull.  Only in the final half-hour, when we are treated 
to several displays of derring-do, does THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK come 
alive.
     In the wake of his popularity explosion resulting from TITANIC, 
Leonardo DiCaprio will prove to be THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK's chief 
drawing card.  He plays two roles (Louis and the masked man), but fails 
to do either especially well.  The somewhat stilted and occasionally-
ripe dialogue doesn't roll easily off his tongue and, for the most part, 
he gives the impression that he's playing dress-up.  Those who found 
DiCaprio inadequate in ROMEO + JULIET will likely cringe at his work 
here.  Equally ineffective are the two female leads. Judith Godreche, 
who was strong in RIDICULE, is reduced to a lifeless mannequin as Louis' 
mistress, Christine.  And Anne Parillaud, who hasn't been impressive 
since LA FEMME NIKITA, offers a flat interpretation of Queen Anne, 
Louis' widowed mother.
     Fortunately, the veteran actors playing the Musketeers are far 
better, and they have the lion's share of the screen time.  Malkovich is 
as delicious as ever, and it's refreshing to see him in a role where the 
primary characteristic is nobility rather than psychotic behavior.  As 
D'Artagnan, Gabriel Byrne successfully essays a character who is 
increasingly conflicted and uncertain about where his true loyalty lies.  
Gerard Depardieu is delightful as the somewhat-fatuous Porthos.  And, as 
Aramis, Jeremy Irons gives his most lively performance in a long time.
     Ultimately, the negatives in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK nearly 
counterbalance the positives.  While the last half-hour is exhilarating 
and recalls the best swashbuckling movies, the film takes a little too 
long to get there, and, along the way, is only moderately successful as 
an historical drama or an adventure.  DiCaprio's name will undoubtedly 
give this picture a box-office boost, but his two characters aren't the 
movie's focus  the aging Musketeers are.  And those who are interested 
in learning how their stories end will find greater satisfaction in 
reading Dumas' novel than in sitting through this thin adaptation.

By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
        I've never been a huge fan of frenetic adventure films featuring soups
of various European-accented actors dressed up in flashy, cumbersome
clothes while brandishing those thin fencing-type swords with the
jewel-covered handles.  On that note, I'd say that my exposure to the
genre is rather limited:  I've seen only portions of the numerous films
about the Three Musketeers, and my knowledge of the books on which these
films are based is even more limited.  
        Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the famous
Alexander Dumas novel (which is part of a trilogy about the musketeers),
is a film that fits securely into the description above.  This is not a
film of profound depth or thought, and I didn't expect it to be.  But I
did want it to be significantly more than well-built sets and Leonardo
DiCaprio screaming "Wear it....until you die in it!"  And while it is
technically sound and acceptably light on intrusive continuity problems,
Wallace's film is overflowing with multitudes of characters and scenes. 
The result is a frantic movie that is entertaining, but lacking in focus
or anything to stimulate thought.  
        DiCaprio plays Louis XIV, the tyrannical young king who refuses to
award the peasants of France with edible food.  He's mostly interested
in bedding young women, but on occasion he pretends to care about his
country.  His personal bodyguard is D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), a
highly-feared general.  D'Artagnan was once one of the musketeers.  The
musketeers--Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich), and Porthos
(Gerard Depardieu)--are an aging bunch now, and have settled into
less-adventurous lives with the emergence of Louis XIV.  
        Conflicts arise when Athos' son, Raul (Peter Sarsgaard) is sent off to
war because Louis is interested in his fiancée, Christine (Judith
Godreche).  When Raul is killed, Athos declares Louis as his enemy;
therefore D'Artagnan, who was his close friend, is also his enemy.  The
remaining three musketeers develop a plan to get Louis out of the
throne.  Aramis knows of a man--whose identity and existence is unknown
to most people due to a big iron mask wrapped around his face--who can
help.  He is the twin brother of Louis, and has been jailed by the King
in fear.
        The film frequently feels less-than-authentic.  Take, for instance, all
of the various accents.  DiCaprio, once again, plays a period character
with a straight American accent.  Depardieu seems to be trying to hide
his French accent for some strange reason, while Byrne and Irons have
slightly lightened their British inflections; even Malkovitch, who can
usually get away with it because is voice is so unusual, can't manage to
make his lines fit in.  The film also allows an occasional anachronism
(actually, I'm guessing:  a word that rhymes with "sits" that references
a lady's bosom just doesn't sound natural in this time period).
        The film doesn't even tell us what it's about until about the 45-minute
mark.  Sure, there's foreshadowing with glimpses of the man in the mask,
but the Musketeers' plan almost feels like a subplot because it occurs
so late in the film.  The main characters seem to be Louis and his
counterpart, but the heroes are the musketeers, and their plan is the
one we're supposed to root for.  I suppose this explains Wallace's
attempt to characterize these men, but with the mangled focus, character
development scenes tend to intrude on the story, and usually feel
pointless.  The best example of this has Depardieu (who is not my
favorite actor) running around nude; he finds a rope and decides it's an
omen suggesting that he hang himself.  This scene does elicit laughs,
though it still feels forced and out-of-place in the film.
        On the whole, I'm disappointed in the performances.  Irons and
Malkovitch are passable, but not up to their capabilities.  DiCaprio is
okay, but I wish he'd try and take on an accent one of these days (he
does do a good job making us realize which of the brothers he is playing
at any given moment, though).  Depardieu takes the French machismo
element of his personality light years beyond my preference, and is
simply annoying to watch.  There are no significant women roles, which I
found irritating; Godreche is uninteresting because the character is
weak and shallow, while Anne Parillaud, who plays Louis' mother, is
given little screen time.  The best in the film is Byrne, and he is
good:  he shows charisma and energy rare to his performances.
        What The Man in the Iron Mask comes down to is, essentially, mindless
entertainment.  The sets are great, the costumes professional, the
scenes are paced well, and the action sequences are exciting.  For a
film that seems like it's engineered to appeal to the younger
generations, it's not a bad film.  But I think most people over the age
of twenty are going to want a little more focus and thought put into a
story that's been told so many times.

The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)
Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and some sensuality/nudity.
----------  Out of 4 stars: ** (2 Stars)
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, John Malkovich, Gabriel Byrne, Gerard
Depardieu, Jeremy Irons, Peter Sarsgaard, Anne Parillaud, and Judity
Godreche.
Fresh off his incredibly successful turn as Jack Dawson in James
Cameron's TITANIC, Leonardo DiCaprio has immensely increased his
popularity to the point of becoming possibly the most famous actor of
his generation.  There is no doubt that both Kate Winslet and DiCaprio
will be able to carry films by themselves, however DiCaprio already had
popularity from his Oscar-nominated turn in the fantastic WHAT'S EATING
GILBERT GRAPE?  It's almost ironic that his film opens thirteen weeks
after TITANIC did.  And, more than likely, it will unseat the Cameron
flick for the top of the box office.  Unfortunately, it will not remain
there.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is one of those gorgeous films that contains
beautiful imagery, colorful costumes, and terrific actors.  However,
what it lacks is good writing.  Watching this film, I saw a story hidden
below the surface of the film that was just waiting to be uncovered.
This film never does it.  It remains a superficially obsessed mess that
cares more about viewers paying to see it than letting viewers become
involved.   This kind of Hollywood thinking has destroyed many films in
that past that could have amounted to great things.  I'm not saying
Hollywood is bad, as I love it.  It's the directors and writers and
producers who think that audiences want more.  Someone should tell them
that we actually prefer less.  And that's The Man in the Iron Mask's
biggest problem: too much of everything, but too little of what we
really want.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK begins well enough, proudly displaying its
gorgeous scenery and vibrant costumes.  Surprisingly, the film begins
its quick descent into mediocrity at the appearance of DiCaprio as King
Louis XIV.  Louis is a pompous, arrogant, and young king, and yet he has
a following, mostly from the upper class society.  The lower class is
extremely poor, not even able to afford something to eat (and what there
is to eat is rotten).  They riot and cry for help, but Louis is more
worried with how many women he can sleep with at once, or how he can
attract a certain woman to him.  This woman is Christine (Judith
Godrčche).  She is beautiful, fair-skinned--and engaged.  Well, almost
engaged, for her love, Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard), can't find the opportune
time to pop the question (I'm not sure, but weren't engagements setup by
the parents back then?).  Unfortunately, before Raoul can ask her, Louis
"arranges" for him to be sent to the front lines of the war against the
Dutch.
With all of the poverty and hatred in the city, the king does need
guards.  One of them is D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), a loyal follower of
Louis and captain of the Musketeers.  However, he happens to be good
friends with the infamous Three Musketeers (I still don't know why
they're called three--there are really four of them!).  Athos (John
Malkovich) is retired, and happens to be the father of Raoul (I smell a
plot convention).  Porthos (Gérard Depardieu) is also retired, although
he spends most of his time flatulently cracking jokes.  Aramis (Jeremy
Irons) is now a priest, but is also retired from the Musketeers.  After
Raoul's death, Athos proclaims that he will kill the king and anyone who
stands in his way.  Unfortunately, D'Artagnan maintains his loyalty to
his king, and won't allow Athos to proceed with his promise.  Athos
meets with Porthos and Aramis again, and tells them that he wants to
replace the king.
This is where the man in the iron mask comes into play.  Prior to this
moment, we have seen him only in agony in his cell.  However, now the
three come to release him from the mask.  They find that the man in the
mask looks exactly like Louis himself.  The next hour involves the three
trying to replace the king with Philippe (DiCaprio).  This is where the
film should have begun.  The screenplay, by Randall Wallace (who also
wrote BRAVEHEART), focuses on the wrong part of the story, and thus
destroys what could have been a highly entertaining film.  Wallace, who
this time also directs the film, seems determined to show that Louis
was, in fact, a completely evil person with no redeeming qualities
whatsoever.  Many people complained about Cal in TITANIC as being too
heartless and inhuman.  Here's a character that those people should
really be complaining against.  Louis practically has no good in him,
using his crown to pleasure himself.  Wallace focuses nearly two-thirds
of the film on this alone, and frankly, it gets extremely boring.  Most
everything that progresses in the "setup" could have been done in half
an hour, leaving the rest of the film open for exploration of the
dilemmas that surround replacing the king with Philippe, or the problems
in the city, or the romantic relationship between D'Artagnan and the
Queen Mother, Anne d'Autriche (Anne Parillaud).
Of course, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK isn't completely horrid.  The final
thirty minutes is what the whole film should have been: enticing,
entertaining, and completely engrossing.  The swash-buckling action is
what most people have come to see, but we are left with iconic
characters skewered to miserable little men who don't pick up a sword
for an hour and a half.  Instead, Wallace hopes that the melodramatic
scenes towards the beginning cover up any poor writing.  It doesn't.  It
does, however, make the audience more aware of the flaws, as we
constantly have more time before something interesting happens.  And
yes, I will admit it--I nearly dozed off twice during the film.  Granted
I was tired prior the film, but normally a movie will keep me awake
throughout.  THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK had nothing to keep my interest,
and only towards the end did I sit enthralled.  Of course, it really
isn't worthwhile to sit through ninety minutes of poorly constructed and
convoluted story telling to get to these thirty minutes of refreshing
and energetic action.
One of the most obvious flaws of the film lies in the dialogue.  While
watching this movie, I was more aware than ever of how film is such a
different medium from the stage or a novel.  The silver screen has the
ability to show what the characters think or say, and yet most films
lean towards dialogue to propel the narrative.  Sometimes this is
effective (THE USUAL SUSPECTS), but here it isn't.  Lines like "I am
doing this because I feel guilty" are almost laughably oblivious to the
cinematic strategies that could have been implemented to portray this
same feeling.  There is also an incredible amount of anachronistic
humor, such as Porthos' mannerisms.  Did people refer to breasts as
"tits"?  Did people just passively "break wind"?  And one of the most
obvious attempts at cheap humor comes when Porthos tries to kill himself
by hanging himself (he also happens to be nude at this time).  I wonder
if Alexandre Dumas had written these into his novel, but I doubt it.  It
seems that he would have more taste then to lower himself to the
inclusion of bodily functions for humor.  Over time, the
"playing-for-the-audience" humor becomes more annoying than funny.
The cast does its best to work with the material at hand.  However,
DiCaprio is definitely miscast as King Louis/Philippe.  DiCaprio is
actually rather good as Philippe, but considering that two roles had to
be played by the same person, DiCaprio wasn't a good choice.  This is
yet another Hollywoodism, as producers try to benefit from his
popularity with the young women (though I bet they didn't realize how
much his success with TITANIC would help the film).  As Louis, DiCaprio
is almost unbearable to watch.  Perhaps this is just due to the writing,
but his cocky appearance is more of an artificial try at seeming
important.  His well-mannered Philippe is fully realized, though he
doesn't come into play for a very long time.  But it is Gabriel Byrne
who steals virtually every scene in the film.  His thoughtful and
emotional performance is the most interesting and captivating, and his
character does get quite a bit of screen time (though I wish it would
have focused on him more).  John Malkovich is energetic and fun as
Athos, and Peter Sarsgaard does a frightfully realistic impersonation of
his son.  Depardieu is just annoying as Porthos, as he tries to hide his
French accent (which is rather ironic considering that this is the one
time that he actually should have one).  Jeremy Irons is deliciously
mysterious, as we can't determine whether or not he is a good guy or a
bad guy (though it probably could have been even less clearly defined).
Both Anne Parillaud and Judith Godrčche provide nice and understated
performances as the only two important females in the story.  But Byrne
steals the film, and his scenes with Parillaud are some of the most
energetic in the whole movie.
As production values go, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is top-notch.  The
sets are visually stunning, with a castle that defies verbal
explanation.  The lush scenery radiates in each and every scene.  The
costumes are appropriate and provide an equal to the scenery.  The
cinematography captures the film with an almost dream-like quality.  The
camera captures the costumes and sets with pleasure, showing off the
incredible amount of work that must have gone in to producing the film.
The score by Nick Glennie-Smith is lush and epic, making it seem just
like the period piece that it is.  However, sometimes the music jumps
too quickly from cheerful to depressing.  But overall, the music is
probably the best thing in the film.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and
some sensuality/nudity.  With gorgeous cinematography (the unveiling of
the man in the mask is the best scene, visually, in the film) and a
wonderful supporting cast, one would have thought this movie would have
been better than it really is.  With no solid foundation from the
screenplay, everything else becomes window dressing, making a poorly
constructed film look better than it is.  It's sad that such a good and
talented cast is wasted in this motion picture.  It just goes to show
that the writing is probably the most important feature in a film.  Even
Wallace's confident direction can't save it.  Overall, just a big
disappointment.  My recommendation: go see TITANIC again, and help it
become number one for a thirteenth week.

Audiences flocking to see this sixth film adaptation of the final of
Alexandre Dumas' "Three Musketeers" trilogy are mostly going to view the
Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio in his dual role. The filmmakers must have been
counting on this in advance and that's why they sabotaged what could have been
 an exciting movie.
It's 1662, many years after the heydays of the Musketeers and the four
friends have aged and gone their separate ways. Aramis (Jeremy Irons) is the
leader of the militant Jesuits. Athos (John Malkovich) is devoted to his son
Raul (Peter Sarsgaard). D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) is the captain of the new
generation of Musketeers and guards young King Louis XIV (DiCaprio) with an
intense allegiance for a mysterious but too-guessable reason. Porthos (Gerald
Depardieu) is attempting to work his way through France's vast supplies of
wine and women, two and three at a time.
The king is a perfect example of why the French Revolution occurred with such
a vengeance. When Raul's sweetheart catches the royal eye, he sends Athos' son
to the front of a border skirmish so the young man will be killed. This unites
three of the four in a conspiracy to replace him with the enigmatic Bastille
prisoner (also played by DiCaprio) clad in an iron mask to hide his identity.
The story has a lot of things going for it: political intrigue, aging heroes,
regal corruption, swashbuckling action and the potential for the ultimate
buddies film. We get very little of any of it on screen.
It's a full hour and a half of not much, before there's any of the swordplay
that could have made the film something more than an eye-feast for teenage
girls. During that final 30 minutes, when they finally get down to "One for
all and all for one", there's the promise that was made, but it's too little
too late.
All of the Musketeers roles are skillfully performed by the actors although
the characters are devoid of much personality. DiCaprio, more than adequate as
Jack in "Titanic", stumbles through both his roles here and was a poor choice
by writer/director Randall Wallace who ironically scripted the wildly
successful "Braveheart". DiCaprio can't hold his own on screen with the
seasoned foursome.
Maybe someday someone will take the last half hour of this film and film a
competent beginning to it. Until then you should plan on buckling your swashes elsewhere.

     Writer, director and producer Randall Wallace's screen version of
Alexandre Dumas's THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK will likely be remembered as
the one that set the record for the most times that the classic phrase,
"One for all and all for one," is spoken.  But none of them are
delivered with anything approaching genuine feeling.
     Wallace pays careful attention to the casting and even more to the
production itself, but little to the story.  The result is an
exceedingly beautiful but vapid picture - a costume drama without the
drama.
     Set in Paris in 1662, the peasants are rioting but the young King
Louis XIV, ensconced in his opulent palace, will believe none of it.
("Riots?  But Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.  Why would
my people feel anything but pride and contentment?")
     Fresh from his justly praised performance in TITANIC, Leonardo
DiCaprio takes on the dual roles of the evil twin Louis and his kinder
and gentler twin Philippe, who is the masked man in prison as the story
begins.  DiCaprio, looking like his fame has gone to his head,
nevertheless, overshadows everyone else in this cinematic soap opera.
That the others have one-dimensional parts, of course, helps him take
center stage.  Arguably the most beautiful actor or actress in
Hollywood today, he especially outshines his main romantic conquest in
the film, played by a rather plain looking Judith Godreche.
     John Malkovich gives a didactic reading of the part of Athos,
which might have worked if the dialog were not so stiff.  Gerard
Depardieu plays a flatulent Porthos way past his prime.  Jeremy Irons
is the overly sincere priest Aramis.  And Gabriel Byrne makes
D'Artagnan into an excessively somber character, who spews out trite
phrases like the rest of them.  Dressed in his splendid robes, for
example, he stops a mob of filthy, hungry peasants by arguing that he
is just one of them, a regular guy.  "Your people are most anxious to
love you but they are eating rotten food and frequently none at all,"
is how he explains the troubles to his king.
     With Peter Suschitzky's golden-hued cinematography, Nick
Glennie-Smith's sweeping and heavy violin music, Anthony Pratt's lush
sets and James Acheson's lavish costumes, the film has much to
recommend it.  In one particularly stunning scene set beside a babbling
brook, the audience is able to soak up the pastoral beauty -- that is
until someone starts speaking.  The best part of the movie has to be
the ending credits.  It is only then that we can enjoy the music
without fear of some inane dialog shattering our rapture.
     "You are surrounded by beauty, by intrigue, by danger, what more
can a man want?" asks D'Artagnan.  How about a movie worth caring
about?  How about characters who say something more meaningful than,
"There is more of me to love than a crown."  How about a production
that isn't so devoid of humanity?  And if Wallace couldn't have done
any of that, couldn't he have at least tried some liberal doses of
humor?  Unless you have a thing for DiCaprio, you're better off renting
any of the other adaptations.
     THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK runs too long at 2:10.  It is rated PG-13
for swashbuckling violence and some sexual situations and would be fine
for kids from around 8 or 9 and up.

Directed by: Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART)
Written by: Randall Wallace, from the Alexandre Dumas class novel
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard
Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Peter Sarsgaard, Judith Godreche, Anne
Parillaud
Ingredients: 
Musketeers, greedy boy king, fancy costumes, father-son themes
Synopsis: 
Is there such thing as swashbuckler movie that has no swashbuckling in
it? THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK comes close. It's an action drama, but I
hesitate to use the word action.
The first hour and a half takes a long time. Basically it takes ninety
minutes to portray that 1600s ruler young Louis XIV of France (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is ice-hearted and cares little for his people. The last half
hour is fast: three old retired guys (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and
Gerard Depardieu) plot treason. They try to secretly get rid of evil
king Louis XIV and switch him with a kindhearted look-alike. Meanwhile
their dear friend d'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), an expert swordsman who
has ties to Louis XIV and is also chief of the royal security force,
must decide whether his loyalties lie with the evil king or with his old
friends. In the end we learn why former hero d'Artagnan supported such a
bad king in the first place. 
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is actually a film version of a French literary
classic written by Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870), an author and playwright
best known for writing entertaining historical fiction. Dumas wrote the
three musketeers' trilogy (THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TWENTY YEARS AFTER,
and LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE). LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE, when translated
into English is subdivided into three smaller works; THE MAN IN THE IRON
MASK is the third of the smaller stories.
Opinion: 
Fans of TITANIC actor and recent Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo Dicaprio
get to see him wear a lot of hunky French period clothing as King Louis.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK also features an all star cast under the
competent direction of Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART). 
Unfortunately, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK rambles and wanders for an hour
and a half. Only the last half hour of the film has some kind of clear
goal or focus. In addition, the script feels strangely one step removed
from real' action or drama. For example, the movie has many chances to
show the tortured faces and poignant memories of main characters, but
instead, we get to see characters sit down and say things like, "I'm
doing this because I feel guilty." Instead of showing a man's face and
his memories of raising a son for twenty years, we see a guy merely sit
down and pout and say, "I'm doing this because I raised a son for 20
years."  Or instead of showing the reverence that all musketeers have
for courage, valor, and heroism, a character merely announces, "They
revere us." Put simply, the dialogue in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
resembles a group therapy session, where there is much talking about
action and drama but the actual action or drama is sparse.
The other deficiency of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is that it doesn't let
us get to know the main characters.  For example, when Athos' son Raoul
dies because of the treachery of the evil King Louis, the audience is
supposed to care. But nobody in the audience knows Raoul and nobody
cares about him because the movie barely shows Raoul or bothers to
develop him. Later of course, Athos TALKS about Raoul, but that's
therapy talk again.
In THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, the retired guys are supposed to be the
heroes. But a good solid focus on them doesn't appear until after 90
minutes have elapsed, so we aren't given enough time to know who they
are or care about their plan or their fate.

        Both critics and audiences alike have scolded Hollywood for monotony and lack
 of originality. Perhaps the reason filmmakers feel the need to turn works of
 literary classics and/or legends into modern movies is a form of penance,
 because if they can't come up with new ideas they can at least use long-loved
 ones as a guarantee for success... in theory. "The Man In The Iron Mask" is
 such a mediocre piece of filmmaking that it not only disproves said theory,
 but goes to show how even the most skilled of filmmakers can go wrong with the
 most basic of concepts.
        The film starts off in traditional "period piece" fashion with the generic
 rhetoric about its setting - something to do with the story of the "Three
 Musketeers," combined with some information about the infamous King Louis XIV
 - a young, greedy, arrogant king who didn't care much about who or what he
 ruled, just as long as he had the power. Leonardo DiCaprio stars here as this
 king, always with a gentle voice and manner which is probably realistic, but
 portrays the character in an extremely stiff way. He seems quite lost here,
 almost to the point of boredom.
        No time is wasted in establishing the story's key elements. Within a few
 minutes we meet our main characters and are given minimal amounts of
 characterization, which will become the film's biggest flaw. All information
 about King Louis is provided in the prologue, or simply implied, so the sense
 of an antagonist or even a conflict feels weak. We then meet our so-called
 heroes: Aramis (Irons), the king's high priest and leader of a silent
 rebellion against him; Athos (Malkovich), a retired musketeer who has the
 film's only emotional sense, that is, his love and honor for his (dead) son;
 Porthos (Depardieu), a bumbling womanizer who provides for lame comic relief;
 and D'Artagnan (Byrne), general of the king's army who will be torn between
 his loyalty to the king and his long-time friends. To say the characters are
 going through the motions is an understatement, especially as portrayed by
 such a talented cast who never give them any definition or texture beyond what
 is required by the script. Like DiCaprio, they seem lost and bored with this
 picture, and the bland direction certainly doesn't help.
        The actual plot involves Aramis' "brilliant" plan to replace the king with
 his identical twin brother Philippe (DiCaprio in a dual role), with whom he
 was separated at birth, lived in the country for 16 years, and has spent the
 last six years in a terrible prison forced to wear an iron mask. The problem
 is this idea is not hatched until the second hour as the first hour is spent
 trying to show how vile the king is, but the story offers nothing new or
 interesting. The king uses a woman for sex and forces her fiancée to die
 "honorably" in the army. The people of Paris are starving to death, but he
 doesn't seem to care. Yes, these two examples should provide us with enough
 reason to hate him, build suspense, and provide for an exciting, action-packed
 finale, but it just doesn't happen.
        Most of the blame falls on writer/director Randall Wallace. As is the case
 all too frequently today, Wallace falls into the Jeckyl and Hyde category - as
 he is responsible for penning the Oscar-winning "Braveheart," and yet fails to
 take a clue from his previous work. The dialogue is too highbrow or
 "Shakesperian-esque" for a modern movie, therefore the actors sound like they
 are reading lines from a script based on a classic novel. 
        The general organization of the story works, but the important details are
 missing or dealt with too quickly. The proof of this is in the conflict itself
 - of course the musketeers free the man in the iron mask  and offer him the
 chance to be king, but they never state a reason why he should accept the
 offer and what this will mean in the long run (Philippe himself brings this
 up, but their answer is more of the boring rhetoric that explains almost every
 conflict in the story). I kept waiting for someone to say something along the
 lines of, "You'll take his place and slowly change from a bad king to a good
 king and everyone will live happily ever after" but this is never hinted at
 until the very end, and by then it's too late.
        I'm sure "The Man In The Iron Mask" is meant to be a light-spirited,
 swashbuckling adventure, but it's difficult to see it as such due to the
 boring story and lack of swashbuckling altogether. In fact, I'd classify the
 film as a straight drama on this basis, and if that doesn't go to show where
 and how much the film goes wrong, I don't know what will.

TMITIM does a couple of smart things to ensure that potential
movie-goers will at least think about seeing this film.  First, it's a
story that soothes us with the familiarity of Aramis, Athos, Porthos
and D'artagnan - the legendary four Musketeers.  Little introduction
is needed about these men, and we can quickly jump into the story.
Louis XIII, the great King whose throne the Musketeers served, has
died and has now been succeeded by his arrogant and cruel heir, Louis
XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The original three Musketeers have now
retired from service and now live relatively quiet lives. D'artagnan,
still an active Musketeer, is now Captain of the young king's
bodyguards.  
Louis XIV is not a well-liked King.  His selfish actions result in
deep resentment by the people.  He is the target of numerous
assassination attempts.  He is also greatly disliked by the retired
Musketeers, who believe that this is a leader truly unworthy of a
Musketeer's devotion.  However, their ire for the king puts them at
odds with D'artagnan, who has sworn an oath to protect the king with
his life.  Nonetheless, the original three know that France will never
prosper unless a change is made.  A bold plan is devised, and it's
success rests on the Man in the Iron Mask, a mysterious figure that
was imprisoned years ago and almost forgotten.  The three Musketeers
must first devise a way to free him and then execute their plan.  If
they succeed, they could alter the future of France.  But, their
biggest obstacle is D'artagnan.
The other attractive element is that the film puts together an
all-star ensemble.  Co-starring Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu, and Gabriel Byrne as the Musketeers, it has tremendous
international star power and mass appeal.  
Yet, despite all these positive points, the story never comes close to
reaching the legendary status of the Musketeers.  One thing that was
unsettling was listening to the actors lines.  At times, they spoke
using the 'Dialect of Infinite Wisdom' (where one speaks so slowly as
if to simulate awesome intelligence), which was void of any conviction
or passion.  At other times, the banter was so tongue-in-cheek that it
seemed to purposely anchor itself in swashbuckling commercialism
rather than dramatic greatness.  Still, at other times, the dialogue
seemed so forced that actors looked like they were straining not to
look or sound foolish.  Additionally, there were some extraneous
subplots and some totally off-the-wall surprises that made me slap my
forehead or cock an eyebrow.
Written by Randall Wallace, the same person that wrote "Braveheart", I
really expected a powerful drama that would explore the rift between
D'artagnan and the Musketeers; the motivating nature behind the young
king; or even the possibilities that present itself when an impostor
with ambitions of sheep-tending assumes the almighty throne.  Yet it
seemed content on just being an action-adventure film about old heroes
that reunite to bring back an era that had been forgotten.  
I felt that a potentially great film was squandered.  TMITIM is an
uneven production that was glorious at some points but unfocused at
others.  I did, however, enjoy Gabriel Byrnes as D'artagnan, who
desparately tried to find a balance between his oath to the king and
his ability to live up to the code of the Musketeers.  And the
climactic ending is a rousing finish that shows how good this film
could have been.  But for much of this film, we needed a  fifth
Musketeer.  His name could have been Pathos!

Review:  The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)
The Man in the Iron Mask is one of those indulgent, corrosively funny films with
one liners that send cheers from the audience and genuinely pointless scenes
that receive sniggers and snorts a plenty.  Theres just one problem  its not
a comedy.  Or at least, it doesnt intend to be one.
You cant say that new comer director Randall Wallace couldnt have seen it
coming.  The international cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John
Malkovich, Girard Depardieu and Gabriel Byrne makes the film constantly sound,
look and feel strikingly different.  Surely, the films greatest achievement is
showing the audience how laughable A grade actors can be if placed in the wrong
situations.
King Louis (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the ruler of France in 1660, but hes not
exactly a wise and thoughtful leader.  He gives rotten food to his people, sends
soldiers to their death so he can have their wives, and locks up his own brother
in a prison for 6 years just so he can claim the crown by himself.  Three of the
four main musketeers (Irons, Malkovich, Depardieu) that faithfully served his
father decide that they have had enough of Louis evil ways, and devise a scheme
to replace the King and bring justice to the people of France.  Their plan: to
dig up Louis identical twin brother (wearing an iron mask) and make a royal
swap.  The only remaining loyal-to-the-thrown musketeer, DArtagnan (Gabriel
Bynre) attempts to foil their plan of treason against the King.
Amused yet? It gets worse.  Without giving too much of the rest of the story
away, let me just say that if you can imagine the most likely possible ending,
then the chances are youd be predicting it very well (with the exception of
some very silly plot twists towards the films completion).
The Man in the Iron Mask is at times a reasonably entertaining film, and if you
re excited about the promise of musketeers in shiny uniforms then you perhaps
you will enjoy it a little (or a lot) more than I did.  But really, what we have
is a film that takes itself so incredibly serious all you can do is laugh  both
at the dialogue and the execution in general.  And, of course, the fact that we
are supposed to believe that these musketeers come from the same part in the
world.
On the up side, some of the battle scenes are genuinely entertaining.  And, may
the truth be told, I liked looking at Leonardo DiCaprio a lot better when he had
that mask on.

The Man in the Iron Mask is bound to disappoint many people who go to a
swashbuckling film to see lots of swordplay.  Writer/director Randall
Wallace wants to do more, but unfortunately he winds up doing less.
It's 1661, the musketeers have all grown into middle age, and their
exploits have become legendary.  Athos (John Malkovich), Porthos (Gerard
Depardieu) and Aramis (Jeremy Irons) have all retired, and only
D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) has stayed on in the king's service.  He now
leads the musketeers.  But their retirement comes to an abrupt end when
Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio) is crowned king of France.  He's a naughty
boy who seduces and casts off women, lives in luxury while Parisians
starve, and casually orders people executed when they displease him. 
Thus, Aramis hatches a plan to switch him for his long-lost twin
Philippe (DiCaprio), whose resemblance to the king has caused his
imprisonment in the Bastille, where he's forced to wear an iron mask.
The main source of fun is seeing DiCaprio defile his newly-won image as
a dreamboat.  We were all hoping his considerable talents wouldn't be
entrapped into a bland leading man's career, and his work here is a
reassuring sign that DiCaprio is more than just a standard-issue
Hollywood heartthrob.  He does a nice job subtly differentiating between
his two roles.  As the bad twin, his smooth self-confidence from 
Titanic now spills over into the smug self-absorption that we all
secretly suspect movie stars of possessing.  DiCaprio's Louis is a
narcissistic phony, and he's intensely amusing to watch.
Nevertheless, the acting honors go to Gabriel Byrne, and after seeing
him get eclipsed by the ensembles in Little Women and The Usual
Suspects, it's nice to see him come out on top here.  He has the right 
combination of gravity and flair for the conflicted D'Artagnan,
especially in the scene where he placates an angry mob.  Depardieu hams
things up, and Malkovich and Irons never find the right tone, but Byrne 
projects his character's romantic frustration and his crisis of
conscience.
Blame the performers' unevenness on Randall Wallace, who betrays his
inexperience as a director.  He fails to balance the movie's humorous
and serious parts and doesn't know how to film the action sequences. 
Perhaps he felt he had to cover up for his older actors (of course, the
aging of the musketeers is the point of the story), but the editing
during the fights makes it hard to tell what's going on, or even who's
who.  Compare this with Disney's 1993 version of The Three Musketeers,
directed by Stephen Herek.  It wasn't a great film, and the younger,
more athletic cast didn't have anything on these actors (though Oliver
Platt was an enjoyable Porthos), but it sure was readable.  This movie
seems destined to be a footnote to the careers of DiCaprio and Byrne. 
It's not enjoyable enough to be anything else.

  Randall Wallace's adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask, more rightly
should be called "The Boy in the Iron Mask." This is not a criticism of the
acting ability of Leonardo DiCaprio, who assays the dual role of King Louis
XIV and his twin brother, Phillippe.
 It is based more on DiCaprio's physical appearance. As he has proven in
such works as This Boy's Life, What's Eating Gilbert Grape  and Basketball
Diaries, DiCaprio is a powerful screen presence.
 Yet his boyish, almost effeminate, looks work against him in this costume
drama. While he matter-of-factly displays King Louis' arrogance and
cruelty, he seems to lack that inner strength, that regal bearing that sets
a king apart from his subjects.
  To his credit, DiCaprio creates two distinct personalities. His use of
his eyes to distinguish between the cold king and his more compassionate
twin is a fine piece of acting, but he is undercut by Wallace's script,
which has the young actor mouthing some rather hoary dialogue.
 Unfortunately, it is not only DiCaprio who suffers from Wallace's very
loose reworking of the Alexander Dumas classic. This sequel to The Three
Musketeers  has been filmed many times before, dating back to one of
Douglas Fairbanks' last swashbucklers in 1929.
 While Wallace has kept the basic plot outline - the aging Three Musketeers
plus D'Artagnan rescue the imprisoned twin of the young, cruel king of
France, the writer of the Academy Award-winning Braveheart has added
characters and subplots that probably would send Dumas spinning in his
grave.
 Wallace even has lifted a subplot from his earlier screenplay involving
forbidden love between a commoner and a person of royalty.
 Another of the film's problems is the conflicting acting styles between
the four brilliant actors playing the over-the-hill
"all-for-one-and-one-for-all" gang.
 Gerard Depardieu, the only real Frenchman among the group, plays his
Porthos much too broadly and comically, almost as if he studied Frank
Finley's interpretation from Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers and The
Four Musketeers from the mid-1970s.
  John Malkovich as Athos makes no attempt at an accent, speaking in his
flat Midwestern tongue, but with the intensity and mannerisms he would
bring to a contemporary work back at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago.
 Jeremy Irons as Aramis, of course, speaks with that upper-class English
accent that immediately brings back memories of his vocal turn as Scar in
Disney's The Lion King.
 As D'Artagnan, Irish actor Gabriel Byrne seems content to merely sulk his
way through the proceedings, interpreting most of his lines in a pained,
whisper-like voice.
 The biggest problem is a lack of chemistry among the quartet. These are
men, legends, who have a lifelong camaraderie, but the audience needs to be
constantly reminded of their glorious past through bits of dialogue because
they are unable to create it through their performances.
 To be fair, this latest screen version of a Dumas work is more appealing
and better worked than the abominable Disney factory recreation of The
Three Musketeers of a few years ago in which Chris O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen
and Kiefer Sutherland were as believable as a group of high school students
performing their fall drama.
  DiCaprio fans won't be disappointed by The Man in the Iron Mask. Dressed
in his kingly robes, the young actor will melt the heart of many a young
teen, while there is enough swordplay and swashbuckling to keep their dates
interested.
  Overall, though, Wallace has taken too many liberties in trying to
modernize a timeless classic that did not need any improvement.

   That there's nothing new under the sun certainly applies to
"The Man in the Iron Mask," given a picturesque treatment by
Randall Wallace in his directorial debut.  More often than not,
a theme in a given movie will bear a biblical prototype.  The
key event in "The Man in the Iron Mask" could have come
right out of Samuel, Chapter 11, describing a sleepless night
of King David who, strolling on the roof of his palace, looked
out over the city and noticed a woman of unusual beauty
taking her evening bath.  Told she was Bathsheba, the wife of
Uriah, David sent for her, slept with her, and got her pregnant. 
David wrote a letter with instructions to put Uriah at the front
of the hottest part of the battle with the Ammonites and then
to pull back and leave him to die.  Uriah was killed along with
other Israeli soldiers.  Those with political power get the
women, though, of course, they never know whether the
affection which the females bestow on them is for the crown
or for themselves.  
   In this adaptation of the story by Alexander Dumas, when
King Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio) of France, like his
counterpart in ancient Israel, sets eyes upon the fair Christine
(Judith Godreche), seduces her and sends her boy friend
Raoul to die.  What makes that the determining event in the
tale is that this malicious act leads to a demand for
vengeance by Raoul's father, Athos (John Malkovich), and
generates a final split between D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne),
who has remained a Musketeer pledged to the service of the
king, and his now-retired colleagues Athos, Aramis (Jeremy
Irons) and Porthos (Gerard Depardieu).
   "The Man in the Iron Mask" is a narrative of lust, romance,
battle and intrigue pitting the loyalty of the leader of the king's
guards, D'Artagnan, against the justifiable hate of his former
comrades-in-arms.  Believing his oath to be sacrosanct,
D'Artagnan refuses to break ranks with the man who
succeeded good king Louis XIII, despite his lord's contempt
for the starving populace and scorn for the most intimate
relationships of his loyal subjects.  Once Raoul has been sent
to his death at the front in a war with the Dutch, director
Wallace focuses on the mysterious man in the iron mask, a
hapless victim of the king's justice who has been sentenced to
spend his life in the Bastille, head affixed with a metal cover
sealed in with a locked, overlaid encasement.  We learn the
identity of the eponymous victim in due course but for those
who have never read the classic comic, far be it from any
critic to reveal the secret.
   Though this version of Dumas's adventurous melodrama is
played straight, there is no absence of humor, both desired
and unintended, with Depardieu supplying the occasional
comic relief.  The most ludicrous of the former musketeers,
Porthos (Depardieu), suffers the fate of many senior citizens
and those approaching the age: he feels useless, unable
even to "straighten his sword" when in the hay with three
women, and intent on suicide.  Aramis, a priest who is looked
upon by his comrades as overly pious, has designs on the
throne that go beyond his priestly duties while Athos is hell
bent on overthrowing the monarch and replacing him with a
kinder and gentler man.
   Like others of the genre, this swashbuckler is awash with
dazzling costumes whose display reaches a climax in a
masquerade ball, which features each member of the court
dressed in evening best with one arm on his partner, the
other supporting a mask.  Costume designer James Acheson,
working with an ample budget, pulls out the stops with an
array of extravagent threads particularly those who flatter the
king's trim body, while production designer Anthony Pratt,
filming exclusively in France, sets most of the action in a
studio on the outskirts of Paris.  But costumes and design
hardly make a movie: this "Man in the Iron Mask" is
disappointingly short on swordplay, the sort of action exploited
so remarkably by actors of past decades like Errol Flynn and
Tyrone Power.  Featuring dialogue which is at worst wooden
and at best somewhat short of inspiring, "The Man in the Iron
Mask" is unlikely to excite the teens who will turn out in force
to see their hearthrob, Leonardo DiCaprio but will find him to
be more effete than regal in the role of the Sun King.  Gabriel
Byrne and John Malkovich are fine as former associates in
the King's Royal Guard who are now at odds with each other,
but the Dumas classic is given routine treatment by its all-star
cast.
   A swashbuckling tale like "The Man in the Iron Mas" was an
obvious choice for a Hollywood movie and, in fact, has been
tried several times before in the guise of "The Three
Musketeers."  Rowland V. Lee directed a dull version in 1935,
Allan Dwan used Don Ameche as D'Artagnan in 1939,
George Sidney highlighted Lana Turner and Gene Kelly in
1948, Richard Lesler helmed a tongue-in-cheek version in
1974 starring Richard Chamberlain, and Stephen Herek used
Charlie in his 1993 escapade with lots of action
and bright Austrian settings.  "The Man in the Iron Mask"
could have been better with a more authentic setting, using
French actors, the French language, and far more action. 
Though director Wallace moves along at breakneck speed,
not hesitating to distract the performers every few minutes
with a new episode, the movie has the feel of a labored
historical drama when it should seeth with cries of revenge
and death to the tyrant. Rated PG-13.  Running time: 130
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998

     In the depths of Paris' infamous Bastille, circa 1662, five figures
stand.  One man is the reason the other four have gathered:  he is
Phillippe (Leonardo DiCaprio) -- the long-imprisoned twin brother of King
Louis XIV (also DiCaprio) -- rescued by these benefactors to replace his
despotic sibling on the throne.  The four other men are figures of legend:
retired Musketeers Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich) and
Pothos (Gerard Depardieu), reunited with their old comrade D'Artagnan
(Gabriel Byrne).  As they prepare to face the King's guard, armaments and
odds heavily against them, the figures cross their swords and utter one of
literature's best-known oaths of allegiance:  "One for all, all for one."
     It is the moment most of the audience -- the non-teenage-female,
DiCaprio-swooning portion -- has been waiting for.  It is a moment
guaranteed to inspire pseudo-spontaneous applause and whoops of
approval...assuming the audience hasn't drifted into a heavy slumber.  For
around 100 minutes, Randall Wallace's rendition of THE MAN IN THE IRON
MASK wanders through attractive sets in search of a consistent tone,
thematic coherence or even a real point.  Is it a lavish, lusty period
romp in the spirit of Richard Lester's 1970s MUSKETEERS films?  Is it a
moody Dickensian pot-boiler of a mysterious parentage and uncertain
motivations?  Is it a showcase for Tiger Beat poster-boy-du-jour DiCaprio?
Is it _ever_ going to get down to the business of Musketeers buckling a
few swashes?  Wallace effectively combined vengeance, romance and
adventure in his script for BRAVEHEART, but in his first film behind the
camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK sputters and hesitates like the work of a nervous
rookie who just keeps throwing stuff at the screen in the vain hope that,
eventually, something's gotta stick.
     The uninvolving and ponderous first hour and a half leaves a viewer
plenty of time to scratch at minor annoyances until they become major
annoyances.  Meticulously smudged rabble rouse themselves for a minor riot
for exactly one scene, perhaps to distract momentarily from the impression
that this is an epic with a cast of tens.  Half the cast speaks with
French accents (all genuine, courtesy Depardieu, Anne Parillaud and
plasticine ingenue Judith Godreche), while the other half appears to have
wandered in from Malibu, or London, or Dublin.  Given the chance to bite
into Louis XIV's nastiness with relish, DiCaprio instead gives him a
tiresome Method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved.  And who
is Peter Sarsgaard (playing the son of Aramis), and has anyone ever done a
more frighteningly dead-on impression of John Malkovich?
     All might have been forgiven if only Wallace had played the Musketeer
trump card for all it was worth.  He's got viewers right where he wants
them with such iconic characters at his disposal; the good will is as
palpable as it is at a James Bond film, where the mere utterance of a
trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement.  There's just no good
excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster
swordplay.  Dumas wrote wonderful pulp; Wallace tries to turn that pulp
into something it's not, only he's not exactly sure what that is.  THE MAN
IN THE IRON MASK is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn, satisfying
only for those interested in going to watch DiCaprio in regal finery
looking his prettiest.  Others will find a waste of stellar cast and
classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been
about for the average viewer:  a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of
re-born legends just a bit earlier than 100 minutes after the lights go
down.

Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace makes his directoral debut with
this adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' further adventures of the Three
Musketeers. While not as good as his earlier film, The Man in the Iron
Mask is entertaining.
The three musketeers have, at this time, retired and gone their separate
ways.  Aramis (Jeremy Irons) has returned to the priesthood, Porthos
(Gerard Depardieu) has devoted himself to earthly pleasures, and Athos
(John Malkovich) has contented himself with raising his son, Raoul
(Peter Sarsgaard).  Their protigi, D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), remains
in the service of the King, Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio).
King Louis is a young king, and not a very good one.  His people are
starving, his armies are fighting unjust wars, and he is more concerned
about chasing the skirts of Raoul's fiancee, Christine (Judith
Godreche). However, King Louis has a secret:  one whose very identity is
so threatening that he has been imprisoned deep within the Bastille and
forced to wear a mask of iron.
What's the one thing you expect out of any movie starring the Three
Musketeers? Swordplay!  But, for some reason, the movie's halfway over
before any true swashbuckling gets done.  When it finally arrives, it is
mostly chaotic, and makes you yearn for the better days of Fairbanks or
Flynn.
But, luckily there's more to the story than simple swordplay.  The drama
in the film is handled well, even though the themes are a bit broad.
The weakest part of Wallace's script is the dialogue, which starts out
very poorly, but, thankfully, does get better as the film progresses.
And the film is helped by a fine cast.  DiCaprio is in fine form here,
given more to do than he was in Titanic. The musketeers are also good,
with only Gerard Depardieu (strangely, the only true Frenchman among the
bunch) seeming out of place.  His Porthos is used primarily for comic
relief, which is mostly neither comical nor a relief.
There are a few moments when the film stutters, particularly in its
first hour, but as its dense plot is given a chance to unfold, the lure
of the story manages to capture its audience.  The Man in the Iron Mask
is far from being the great epic it strives to be, but it is ultimately
enjoyable, and delivers entertainment for the dollar.

It's always interesting to watch a film in which several A-list actors
have been thrown into the fold with each other. Conflicting acting
styles are modified (sometimes) to give interesting and fresh
perspectives (sometimes) on actors we've known for quite some time. A
successful meshing of talent like this is one of the brightest things
about THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, the cinematic rendition of the third
episode in Alexandre Dumas' THREE MUSKATEERS trilogy. Unfortunately, a
lot of the talent incorporated into IRON MASK is not in the limelight
for a good portion of the movie, and so the finished product is a bit
muddled. So is the A-list cast the only thing that makes IRON MASK
worth watching? 
Trying to pass THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK off as a heavyweight period
costume drama is like trying to pass a Geo Metro off as a muscle car.
Director Randall Wallace, who wrote the script for Braveheart and also
wrote the script here, rushes his drama through its opening moments. He
doesn't take advantage of the initial screen time to build the
atmosphere of a famine-wrought Paris on the edge of revolution, and the
sets that he constructs and fills with extras do not have a very
Renaissance feel about them. Without atmosphere, the movie has a hard
time conveying the characters' motivations and a lot of great characters
are therefore unfortunately left empty. 
The plot itself is relatively simple. In the late 1600s, King Louis XIV
(Leonardo DiCaprio) sits on the throne of France, although his country
is in shambles. Aided by D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byerne), he shows no signs
of improving, although D'Artagnan hopes for the better. Louis has also
earned the hatred of several of his Muskateers (now retired), including
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis (John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, and Jeremy
Irons). The three conspire to replace the king with his twin brother
Phillippe (also DiCaprio), who is locked up at the Bastille. They spirit
the young lad out of prison, teach him the ways of royalty, and make the
switch during a costume party, but the wily D'Artagnan notices and soon
things are headed for the worse. 
DiCaprio's double role does not necessarily make him twice as good.
Although his characters are so far apart that it almost seems like there
are two different actors, his arrogance for Louis is stale and his
innocence for Phillippe is too cute for the character's good. DiCaprio
did much better in TITANIC. The Three Muskateers and D'Artagnan are the
best, but Wallace has written them off to the side until the end and
does not take full advantage of their characters: the straightforward
Malkovich, the buffoonish Depardieu, and the contemplative Irons are all
fine performances. Byrne as D'Artagnan isn't as good, but only because
he takes the side of the evil Louis. Overall, it's obvious that
lightning doesn't strike the same place twice, both for DiCaprio and
Randall Wallace. IRON MASK is missable for better fare.
FINAL AWARD FOR "THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.

I now include a section where YOU the surfer can recommend movies to
ME and other netheads. Have a freakin' good time.)
starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gabriel
Byrne, Gerard Depardieu
based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas
written and directed by Randall Wallace
DiCaprio is a wonderful screen presence, possessed of an androgynous
beauty; he would have been at home in a silent film, for his cat's
eyes telegraph everything he's feeling. He's also very much a product
of the nineties: the only reason he worked in Titanic is because Jack
Dawson was a man out of his element, a bad boy hipster on a ship full
of snobs. Put frilly clothes on Leo and ask him to portray a historic
Frenchman, and said eyes suddenly convey confusion. He is an actor out
of his element as Rimbaud in Total Eclipse and, now, as King Louis XIV
in The Man In The Iron Mask.
The film begins with heinous King Louis ordering the slaughter of
Jesuit traitors to D'Artangan (Byrne), his loyal Captain of the Royal
Guard. Then Louis falls in lust with the engaged Christine, and orders
the slaughter of her fiancee. This leads Athos (Malkovich), the father
of the dead fiancee, on a rampage. He reteams with ex-Musketeers
Aramis (Irons) and Porthos (Depardieu), and they concoct a revenge
plan: the release of Phillipe, Louis's secret identical twin, who has
been kept for years in a dungeon, his face shielded by an iron mask. A
switcheroo is performed, with harrowing results.
DiCaprio is not the only weak link in the chain. Malkovich's
performance feels phoned-in, Judith Godreche as Christine is
unremarkable, and the remaining members of the cast are forced to
repeat "All for one and one for all" ad nauseum. Randall Wallace's
adaptation is problematic: the dialogue lacks flavour, wit,
intelligence, and period nuances. As a debut director, he brings
nothing unique to the table cinematically; picture a high school play
enacted on Masterpiece Theater. There are a handful of decent moments,
and Depardieu stands out as the womanizing, suicidal Porthos. He's
also the only male Francophone to be found in a story that takes place
entirely in France.
It's a shame DiCaprio had to follow up the biggest film in history
with The Man In The Iron Mask. Perhaps working with this stellar cast
convinced him it might work. The film, despite being miles ahead in
quality of Disney's recent Musketeers picture (Charlie Sheen, we
hardly knew you were gone), is simply not the grand, powerful epic it
wants to be.  Diverting, yes, but I think the next time I crave The
Three Musketeers, I'll stick with the chocolate bar.

review: ** (out of ****)
"The Man in the Iron Mask," based on the classic novel by Alexandre
Dumas, is a well-made adventure film that doesn't have much adventure.
It has a lot of beautiful French locations, a stunning A-list cast of
actors, and technical merit oozing from every corner, but it never
really grabs hold of you the way a good swashbuckling adventure should.
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Three Musketeers,
Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich ), and Porthos (Gérard
Depardieu) are retired when the film opens. Or maybe it's because much
of the plot deals with intrigue and mystery rather than swordplay and
gunfights. But no, I think it's something deeper than that. There's an
underlying problem with "The Man in the Iron Mask" that keeps it from
ever being truly entertaining or rousing in the way that it should be.
Simply put, it never convinces us that it's not a costume movie.
The story takes place in France in 1662, where the spoiled young King
Louis (Leonardo DiCaprio) rules in decadent luxury while his subjects
are starving in the streets. The original Three Musketeers have retired,
leaving their fourth, D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) as the head of the
Musketeers, sworn to protecting the King. Louis is a self-absorbed, evil
brat of a king, and he finally pushes the original Musketeers over the
edge when he uses one of King David's nasty tricks from the Old
Testament: he sends Athos's son, Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard) to die in the
front lines of battle so he can make off with Raoul's fiancee, Christine
(Judith Godrčche).
Although D'Artagnan refuses to betray the King, the other Musketeers
conspire to get rid of Louis. It turns out that Louis has a twin brother
that not even his mother, Queen Anne (Anne Parillaud), knows about
because she was told he died after birth. In order to maintain his
unchallenged claim to the throne, Louis had his brother, Philippe (also
played by DiCaprio) put in prison and locked inside an iron mask so no
one would know his identity. The Three Musketeers plan get rid of Louis
by breaking Philippe out of jail and switching him with the evil King.
"The Man in the Iron Mask" was adapted from the Dumas novel by
first-time director Randall Wallace, whose main claim to fame is his
Academy Award-nominated script for Mel Gibson's "Braveheart." Because of
his connection with that film -- also a period movie filled with swords,
evil royalty, and revolution -- comparisons will be inevitable. The fact
is, "Braveheart" worked brilliantly because it pulled use into the story
from its opening moments and convinced us that we were watching William
Wallace fight the English armies in the 12th century. "The Man in the
Iron Mask" never gets us to make that leap, and we are so consciously
aware that it is a period movie that it becomes impossible to be fully
engulfed by it.
Technically, the film is a marvel. Wallace assembled a team of cinematic
professionals who have worked in this kind of material before. The
production design by Anthony Pratt, who did such a brilliant job on John
Boorman's Arthurian epic "Excalibur," is as glorious in the wealth
surrounding King Louis as it is grotesque in the dingy dungeon occupied
by the prisoner of the title. The costumes were designed by James
Acheson, whose experience ranges from "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" to
his Academy Award-winning design for "The Last Emperor."
Ironically, the movie's main drawback is the cast of Academy Award
darling actors. DiCaprio, hot off "Titanic," hits a wall from the get-go
-- he never convinces us that he's a French king. Irons, Malkovich, and
Depardieu all come off like themselves with hair extensions and
Musketeer clothing. Their performances aren't bad, they're just
inadequate for the material. Depardieu has some amusing moments as
Porthos, who is traditionally the fun-loving jokester of the group, but
Irons is too grim and Malkovich is terribly miscast as the grieving
Athos. All these actors have worked in period pieces before, but you
wouldn't know it; their acting is much too stagy to be taken seriously
on film.
Of course, some of the fault can be laid at the feet of Wallace's
dialogue, which is all too often stilted and showy. Not even an actor as
talented and multi-faceted as Gabriel Byrne can pull off a line like,
"To love you is treason to France. But not to love you is treason to my
heart." But, as bad as that sounds, at least we can take heart in the
fact that he didn't even attempt a French accent.

Alexandre Dumas, the novelist who wrote 'The Three Musketeers' in the
19th century would be spinning in his grave if he knew that the only
Frenchman in 1998's 'The Man in the Iron Mask' would have the weakest
role.  Also written in the 19th century by Dumas, 'The Man in the Iron
Mask' was put into print after 'The Three Musketeers' and it, along with
'The Three Musketeers', actually contains four heroes: Athos, Porthos,
Aramis and D'Artagnan.  They are portrayed in this version of 'The Man
in the Iron Mask' by John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, Jeremy Irons and
Gabriel Byrne.  Set in 1662, their King, Louis XIV of France (Leonardo
DiCaprio), is a tyrant, watching his people starve while he lives in the
seductive life of luxury, and is a true law unto himself.
There have been many versions of both 'The Three Musketeers' and 'The
Man in the Iron Mask' produced for film and television and this one has
to ranks in the much lower half of all that has been accomplished.
The musketeers are defenders of the French crown, a high powered army of
loyal soldiers who possess a talent to wield a sword better than anyone
to protect their sovereign ruler.  D'Artagnan (Byrne), is the most loyal
and says he will not betray his King, no matter how ruthless his methods
are, somehow hoping his majesty will become a better man.  Athos,
Porthos and Aramis are past their prime and have retired to a more quiet
life and decide to replace the King with his twin brother, the man in
the iron mask who the King perceives as a threat to his power. They are
motivated to overthrow the King when one of them is unknowingly deemed
to be a suspicious traitor to the crown.
Leonardo DiCaprio and the rest of the cast are convincing in their
roles, despite speaking English and containing no French accents
whatsoever, except for Depardieu, but his role is the weakest and most
clownish in the film.  Malkovich is miscast as he was in the 1988 period
piece 'Dangerous Liaisons' and why an Englishman, complete with an
accent to boot (Irons) would be asked to play in this is a mystery.  But
their professional dedication to their roles make it work and DiCaprio
is believable as both the King and his more decent twin.
The real problem with the film is that by concentrating solely on the
dramatic set-up of the first 90 minutes or so, the finished product, at
a little over two hours, comes off as relatively lifeless and rather
stiffly written instead of sophisticated and high brow, as it should
be.  Written and directed by Randall Wallace who wrote director Mel
Gibson's 1995 Oscar winner 'Braveheart', Wallace shows he has no talent
as a director and his attention to detail is pretty superficial.  The
costumes in 'The Man in the Iron Mask' are noticeably "costume shop" in
their appearance and the art direction and sets are perhaps the only
saving grace, technically.
Teenage girls are sure to enjoy watching DiCaprio in his first role
since 'Titanic' but one misfired scene has DiCaprio standing still in a
room with his long hair, and some of it is draped over his face and with
his attire, it just looks too feminine.  I was imagining ear rings on
him at that moment and it actually seemed funny.  Something that I'm
sure wasn't intended and it shouldn't have been allowed to happen.
DiCaprio's hair in many scenes with his female companions actually looks
longer than theirs does.  Perhaps appropriate, but it just seems that
someone should have reminded director Randall Wallace that the film is
set in the 1660's and not the 1960's.  Peace.

Maybe maybe! It's just a "me" thing. Maybe my view of movies is warped,
changed to a static antipathy by reel after reel after reel, only
relinquished every once in a while. Then again maybe the general view of
movies is an adulteration upon the actual quality of standard: the old weary
critc's question "Do people like good movies or do people like bad movies?"
I always get like this when I have to tell someone something that wouldn't
rather hear. I say this in as light of a way now as I can, like a doctor
over a dead patient. "The Man in the Iron Mask" isnt' worth the price of a
ticket.
The film, which I thought originally would be bad by Rule From the Critic's
Bible #126, An actor never has two critically great movies in a row (of
course that one is crap, but ), started to surprise me right off the bat,
honestly impressing me with a re-do of Versailles, which so many other films
about France failed utterly in accomplishing. It then delved itself into a
rich tapestry of life and made me think, honestly think that the movie would
be the surprise of '98, bringing this terrifying start to a bad year to an
end (although on repute I have heard that the movie "Dark City" is the one
to see if you are interested in breaking the Bad Movie Binge). Then you
brought in the main plot element: The Man in the Iron Mask.
After that it just becomes this dull and repetitious movie, with stupid item
after stupid item. You realize how poor the dialogue is, how sadly done the
movie is, and how bored out of your gourd you are. This takes about an hour
and a half.
But then why, you ask, are so many people coming away from it with a smile
on their face? Because the movie is a feel-good movie with a feel good
ending, and, as cheap as it is it will end up a hit due to the raw star
power of the Oscar-robber DiCaprio, who's new $20 Million a movie salary
matches his power to draw female audiences, should he want, to salivate
pavlovian like over a Banana Split at a Governer's in Maine. Hey, no one
ever said an actor couldn't make two hits in a row (Rule from the Critic's
Bible #127).

        From the writer of Braveheart (Randall Wallace), comes this middle age
drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Leonardo DiCaprio. That's right double
Leo, he plays the mean king (Louis) and the apparently extremely virtuous
Philippe. 
        King Louis is an evil king, he doesn't feed his people and he sleeps
around, to name a few of his transgressions. Guarded by the faithful
D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), who served Louis' father, Louis flaunts his
wealth while his people starve. Seeing the injustice of Louis' reign former
musketeers Aramis, Athos and Porthos (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and 
Gérard Depardieu, respectively) come up with a plan to expel King Louis
from his throne. To do this they must rescue Philippe (Louis' lost twin
brother) who has been locked away in a prison, his face locked in an iron
mask. If there plan goes correctly they will be able to switch the brothers
and no one will know. 
        Its amazing to me how the story is drawn out for close to two and a half
hours, but Randall Wallace manages to do it, although its undeniably slow. 
The cinematography (Peter Suschitzky) and costumes (James Acheson) and
admirable, but not incredible. All four of the musketeers steal the show
from young Leo, who plays the twins very unconvincing. The movie is really
slow, and although attempts to be as stunning as Braveheart, really doesn't
get even close. Bottom Line:  Too long and too watered down to reach the
quality this one is aiming for, although there a few mildly entertaining
scenes.
