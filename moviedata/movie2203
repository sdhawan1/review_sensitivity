"The Edge" is a curious movie that qualifies for the epithet
"experimental." No, it's not conventionally weird, strange or bizarre. On
the contrary, on the surface it's just another grandiosely shot picture of
survival, tenacity and machismo in the mountains of Alaska (played by the
mountains of Alberta). Its plot is anything but original.
To the wilds of Alaska, aging billionaire Charles Morse (Hopkins) flies in
his private, 8 million-dollar plane. With him are his much younger wife
Mickey, a fashion model played by model Elle Macpherson; fashion
photographer Bob (Baldwin) who fairly discreetly lusts after Mickey (they
may or may not be lovers); Bob's African-American assistant  Stephen
(Perrineau). Bob is on an exotic shoot of Mickey, Charles just (?) comes
along.
The fancily rustic lodge is run by elderly Styles played by the excellent
character actor L.Q.Jones, seen in many westerns and a near-fixture of Sam
Peckinpah movies. He engages tenderfoot Charles in an ironic contest on
local lore --which the mogul handles handily. Aha! There's something more
than just money to this fellow!
Indeed, Charles is a bookworm, someone who lives his life vicariously
through books of all types, including practical ones, and from which he
seems to remember everything. Bob the photographer may have cameras, but
Croesus Charles has photographic memory. His is a wealth of information,
from trivial-trivia to trivia-not-trivial and more...
Charles is played magnificently by Hopkins, his face hardly registering
emotions, ever serious even when he ocasionally half-smiles. On the first
night at the lodge, Mickey asks him to go downstairs and get her some food.
He descends with a lantern, starts slicing, finds himself aware of
something ominous around him. Suddenly the lights go on, all appear
shouting Happy Birthday. It's a dumb, tasteless joke. Charles is presented
with a pocket watch and knife.
Already the suspicion that there's something bizarre going on dawns on us.
Already too, the absurdisms of the movie start crawling in, and the many
whys and hows to come.
Irony and satire creep in. Fashion photography is quietly mocked for its
excesses. Is it really necessary to go to such wilderness for a model to
pose? Does billionairess-by-marriage Mickey need the money? I won't go into
the many possible reasons for the above. Bob has artistic ambitions. Spying
the portrait of an Indian he admires this great, pure "19th century"
artifact, wonders who had shot it. "I did, last year" replies host Styles.
So much for connoisseurship of art. So much for the one-upmanship that
gives the edge. One begins to see the wry, sly humor in  David Mamet's
script.
The next day, Bob, shooting ridiculously costumed Mickey, is unhappy with
the process as well as with his assistant  having forgotten to bring shoe
polish. We're inching further into the realm of the absurd, which is
compounded when know-it-all Charles declares "The inside of a banana peel
will shine shoes." Sounds like information from those "At Home" tips in
newspapers.
Bob decides that  Charles and he must find the Indian hunter of the photo
and incorporate him into the shoot. They fly off in a hydroplane. As
Charles and Bob chat about the effect the tycoon's wealth has on people and
the effect Mickey has on Bob, out of a blue sky Charles comes up with "How
are you planing to kill me?" That very moment, out of the blue sky  birds
collide with the craft which goes down into a lake. Charles, Bob and
Stephen survive. There is an abundance of scary moments in scary mountains.
Now to something personal. I don't usually dispense advice, but I do
counsel all, no matter what they do, to carry always a  Swiss Army knife, a
pocket flashlight and a lighter. This is the nth  film to vindicate me.
Charles's gift knife frees, underwater, Stephen from his jammed safety belt
and will be a survival tool in other ways. The other two items are missing.
Bob finds some six bookmatches. How they have remained dry is another
puzzlement.
Cool, near-unflappable, fast-reacting Charles, with nary a change of
expression, is obviously the man to get the trio out of their predicament.
A Nobel caliber Old Boy Scout, he knows the answers: making a compass from
a metal needle on a floating leaf (very possible); later, trying to fish
with his gold watch-chain (ho-hum); stating you can make fire from ice by
using ice as a lens (most doubtful), and so on. He has the edge over Bob.
Especially when a huge, man-killing Kodiak bear starts stalking and
attacking them.
What we have here is a tongue-in-cheek, Mamet-ized adventure that takes on
film cliches and conventions. Three men start out together. Needless to say
that they'll first go around in circles; that there has to be an accident;
that the  first to go is the man of color (when none available, movies go
to a supporting player); that they can go without food for days; that
somehow the remaining survivors make an instant, anti-bear  circle of fire
(but  earlier, why did Bob use one of his precious matches for a smoke?).
Charles and Bob ought to have been dead from cold by now, but never mind.
Still keeping his edge, Charles devises a trapper's way to kill the bear.
Next the companions are seen
wearing  (uncured!) bear-fur coats.
The point of this extravagant yarn is, of course, to throw together
competitors, show their true natures, how they change and, if they survive,
how their future lives and relations might be affected. The once-jaded,
impersonal Charles finally does declare "I'm going to start my life all
over again." Sheesh! And the two engage into would-be probing dialogues.
There's much more but it shall not be revealed. Enough to say that the
finale cuts abruptly and shows us no aftermath. Before this, Mamet's black
humor had worked, but only partly. This because the movie, tongue or no
tongue in cheek, is overwhelmed by non-stop harrowing scenes that make it
downright unpleasant. The recipe's mix of ingredients does not really take.
The sites and sights are impressive, the photography excellent, the score
generic, and Bart the bear, helped by ursutronics,is properly chilling in
the already chilly air.

Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Harold Perrineau, Elle Macpherson.
Screenplay:  David Mamet. Director:  Lee Tamahori.
How many billionaires (Anthony Hopkins) in their late fifties are well read
and able to survive the winter wild and man-eating bears? Not many, but
let's put aside unlikelihoods to focus on what this movie has to offer. It
teaches us not to put our trust in young, pretty wives who are super models
(Elle Mcpherson) or to rely too heavily on their photographers (Alec
Baldwin). When your death is everybody else's gain, nobody can be trusted
and the cliché term poor little rich billionaire comes to mind.
This movie should just focus on men pooling their resources together to
survive the wilderness, leaving out the melodramatics of attempted murder
and betrayal. The plot is initially engrossing, but becomes hard to swallow
when one man becomes an excessively, forgiving hero and the other a literal
dying swan. Find me a humane billionaire and I'll gladly donate five dollars
to the Mother Theresa Foundation, find me one who doesn't have a lawyer as a
best friend' and I'll donate ten. One would have thought that life
threatening experiences such as a bear hunt would create sufficient male
bonding to resolve most differences, but apparently not so. If Helen was
enough to cause the fall of Troy and Eve the fall of man, then perhaps Elle
is sufficient to make a man think with his dick instead of his head.
By far the best actor is the bear. These big, mangy beasts are too often
disguised as soft cuddly toys which children take to sleep. This is most
uncharacteristic of them (soft, cuddly) and the question of beds should
never have arisen with Goldilocks in their jaws. Anyone who tells their
child otherwise is being dishonest. It is this fascinating creature that
makes this story exciting. The rest of the cast is merely supportive.
Anthony Hopkins skilfully portrays an intellectual, resourceful billionaire
who is unusually compassionate, and Alec Baldwin injects hilarity into the
situation when he starts crying; but this is truly the tale of the big, bad
bear.

        Just as the men-lost-in-the-woods genre seemed to fizzle out, 
along comes THE EDGE, a fresh, clever film written by fresh, clever 
David Mamet. His screenplay combines elements of his action movies 
like Homicide with his dialogue-driven plays on film like GLENGARRY 
GLEN ROSS, not a combination I would have forseen as successful. 
A lot of what makes THE EDGE work lies in the performances of its 
two leads -- Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.
        Hopkins plays a billionaire who accompanies his model wife 
(model Elle Macpherson) and some others to the wilds of Alaska for 
an exotic photo shoot. Early on, two important details are cleverly 
established -- Hopkins has a super-human level of book smarts never 
put to practical use and Baldwin is jealous of Hopkins, in particular 
his choice of a spouse.
        The next day, Elle is decked out in Indian garb for a photo 
shoot that needs a male model. Baldwin, the photographer, is 
determined to find a man for this shoot and happens upon a portrait 
of a buff native. The owner points them in the direction of this guy 
and four of them take off in Hopkins' private plane to find him. The 
trip is not a success; the plane goes down and the pilot dies. The three 
who are left, Hopkins, Baldwin and his assistant (Harold Perrineau) 
are stranded in the middle of nowhere, with no chance of rescue in 
the foreseeable future.
        It all could have turned into SWISS FAMILY HOPKINS right 
about this point, but THE EDGE continues its level of brooding 
brilliance through all of Hopkins' chances to test out everything he's 
read. Mamet isn't subtle with foreshadowing, having Hopkins reading 
"Lost in the Woods" a few minutes before he steps on the plane and 
asking Baldwin, "How are you planning to kill me?" just before the 
plane goes down, but the movie is way above the expected plot twists.
        From the preview, I thought the whole movie would be 
Baldwin stalking Hopkins in the woods, but THE EDGE keeps us 
guessing about the Baldwin angle until the last half-hour or so. It's 
man vs. nature until then, with the three stranded men scavenging for 
survival and fighting the enormous "Bart the Bear," who should have 
been the fourth-billed star in the movie. On paper, all of this seems 
like cliche, but even the bear fights are tense and pulsing with 
intelligence.
        Hopkins is always good, but after seeing THE EDGE , it 
seems impossible that his character in THE EDGE could have been 
done justice by anyone else. Baldwin's character could have been 
played by a million other actors, yeah, but he does a good job here, 
and reminded me that he can be effective when he has the writing to 
back him up. In stuff like THE JUROR, he was at the mercy of his 
material, but in anything Mamet-related (GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS), 
he is terrific. And it's interesting casting him here as a man with a 
killer jealousy for someone else's wife; as Kim Basinger's husband, 
Baldwin has probably been called "lucky stiff" by a million beer-
swilling blue collar workers.

Tell me if this doesn't sound wonderful to you: You're a billionaire and
despite your age, you have a young, gorgeous model for your wife. When it
comes time for a photo shoot, you accompany your lovely bride, on your own
private plane mind you, to a beautiful, forest clad region complete with a
lake, snow capped mountains, and a cozy little cabin to sleep in.
Paradisiacal, eh? Oh, I just forgot to mention one thing . . . during an
excursion, your plane goes down and you're stuck fighting for your life in the
middle of the woods. Ok, not so great after all.
This is the plot for THE EDGE, an adventure/thriller written by David Mamet
and directed by Lee Tamahori. The billionaire is Charles Morse, played like a
perfect blend of Daddy Warbucks, MacGyver, and Grizzly Adams. The beautiful
wife is Mickey, played by Elle MacPherson in an essentially non-existent role.
In fact, the real purpose behind the character of Mickey is to allow for a
conflict between Morse and Robert Green (Alec Baldwin), Mickey's photographer
who just happens to go down along with Charles and the plane. Just before the
plane flies into a flock of migrating birds and crashes into the water below,
Charles confronts "Bob" about his true feelings for Mickey. In fact, the
aerial collision is cued with Charles asking Bob, "How do you plan to kill
me?"
The pilot dies and Charles, Bob, and Bob's assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau
Jr.) are left to fend for themselves in a cold, aboriginal climate. Through
all this, Charles manages to keep his calm, which is more of an aggravation
than a comfort to Bob and Stephen. Nonetheless, they trust in Charles'
seemingly omnipotent understanding of life, nature, and the outdoors and
follow him thru the maze of trees in an attempt to rescue themselves (all the
while continuously confronting an overly persistent bear).
Reading a summary of THE EDGE would surely make one want to see the film. It
*sounds* rich, intriguing, exciting, and suspenseful. But with shotty
direction and dialogue that trudges along like dead weight, you're
expectations will quickly be dashed. In fact, if you have any sense, you might
just walk out of the theater within the first twenty minutes of the show -
it's that bad. Thankfully, if you do stick it out, it manages to pick up into
a semi-mediocre film after about thirty or so anaesthetic minutes.
The actors can't quite be blamed here. Although the characters are pretty
deadpan (special notice going to the trite, uneven Bob Green role), the
director seems more at fault. Tamahori doesn't seem to know where to take this
and winds up with only sporadic moments of intensity. Keep in mind, however,
that the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith wants you to feel that adrenaline
kick over the slightest things. It gets very tiring.
The only saving grace THE EDGE has to offer are some spectacular shots of
Canada, where it was filmed. There are some fabulous, breathtaking views of
Mother Nature's handiwork, but sadly it doesn't make this film worth sitting
through. If you still feel determined to see this one, please try to catch it
on the big screen before it's "reformatted" to fit the little one. If you
don't have the beautiful landscapes to appreciate in this movie, you'll have
nothing at all.

At last a thriller with a protagonist who could be a contestant on
Jeopardy.  That is billionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins).
Charles thinks it is a wasted talent to know every kind of trivia;
nothing one can use in real life.
Real life is his wife, very much younger than he, the stunning
Mickey who is a model on a shoot in Alaska with Robert Green (Alec
Baldwin) the high fashion photographer;  her husband has been
invited to come along..  Green is in love with Mickey, as who could
resist her incredible smile?   When a new site for  the shoot is
needed, Robert, accompanied by Charles, take off by plane to scout
other locales.  The plane crashes in an Alaskan wilderness, and now
Charles and Robert have to depend on each other for survival. What
complicates matters is that Charles is certain his wife and Robert
have been having an affair.
Suddenly, Charles' knowledge of  trivia becomes the only thing
between living and dying.   There is little of which he is unable to
take advantage, from making fire to warding off a bear who is intent
on tracking them.  The question is, does Charles really want to save
Robert; another question is, would Robert kill Charles if there was
a chance to get back to civilization without him?   The two are as
unlike personalities as ever have been thrown together in a struggle
for life.     This is equally true of the acting styles of Hopkins
and Baldwin.   Add that the director chose a famous super-model to
portray a famous super-model and Macpherson came through very
nicely.
THE EDGE is a tensely fascinating thriller with two  men wary of
each other, a determined bear who does not care which of the two he
tears apart, the weather and the isolation of being lost and
probably never found.    Exceptional performance by Hopkins . . . as
always.

     THE EDGE is an okay thriller about a billionaire bookworm (Anthony
Hopkins) and a swinging-dick fashion photographer (Alec Baldwin) who,
along with one of the hired help, get stranded sans provisions in the
Alaskan wild, miles from their middle-of-nowhere lodging, where the rich
man's model wife (Elle Macpherson, contributing to the local supply of
timber) and the rest of their party is waiting.  The catch?  Well, there
are a couple.  First, the younger dude may or may not have dangerous
designs on Mrs. Money Bags.  Second, that seemingly unassuming old guy
is actually a fount of knowledge-- theoretical, at least-- on the sub-
ject of outdoor survival.  Third, it's bear season.  And, when one of
those 1800-pound monsters gets a taste for human flesh, well, guess who
gets eaten first.
     As directed by Lee Tamahori (MULHOLLAND FALLS, ONCE WERE WARRIORS),
from a script by David Mamet of all people, THE EDGE doesn't have much
of one.  The various elements, while admittedly intriguing, never gel
into a compelling, cohesive whole.  Hopkins delivers a thoughtful per-
formance, while his costar slogs through a much murkier characteriza-
tion.  What do these men *really* mean to each other?  Who knows, but
they *do* get to engage in one whammo of a bear fight.  However unaf-
fecting the first and final reels are-- did they have to reveal *all* of
the survivalist secrets in those first few scenes?-- the big battle is
probably worth the matinee price of admission.  I mean, when will you
ever again get to see Hopkins, a live bear, and a handmade spear sharing
the same frame?  Breathtaking scenery, too.

     There's a fundamental problem with the two principle characters
writer David Mamet drops into his wilderness adventure THE EDGE.  Charles
Morse (Anthony Hopkins) is a multimillionaire businessman who accompanies
his wife, a model named Mickey (Elle Macpherson), on a location shoot in
the Arctic; Bob (Alec Baldwin) is the fashion photographer who seems a bit
too interested in his subject.  When a plane crash leaves Charles, Bob and
an assistant named Steve (Harold Perrineau) stranded miles from
civilization, the three men are forced to work together, use their wits
and overcome their antagonisms in order to survive.
     That should have been the idea, anyway.  THE EDGE is a wilderness
adventure which also wants to be a psychological drama, but forgets to
develop a convincing conflict between the two leads.  In fact, there are
precious few screen minutes of any kind between Charles and Bob before the
are stuck together.  The rivalry over Mickey is clearly meant as the main
grudge between them, but that conflict doesn't develop until quite late in
the film.  For the most part, antagonism between Charles and Bob is
presented as a given.  After all, there's a beautiful woman involved, envy
of wealth, stressful situations...what's not to be antagonistic over?
     For one thing, the situations aren't all that stressful, thanks to an
inherent lack of tension in the characters.  On the one hand there's Bob,
who proves to be a poor choice of roles for Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin can be
as menacing as they come when he's allowed to swagger a bit; Bob, however,
is generally too dim to be much of a challenge to Charles, or much of a
help to their mutual survival.  Charles, on the other hand, turns out to
be as filthy smart as he is filthy rich.  Every trivial piece of
information he has ever read has become part of his photographic memory,
making him a walking encyclopedia of primitive anthropology, basic
physics, first aid, forestry, engineering and alternative cures for
side-aches.  As you watch Charles fashion a compass from a magnetized pin
and a floating leaf, or construct a squirrel trap from bent twigs, or go
fishing with a thread from his sweater and a watch fob, you get the
distinct impression that you're watching a portrait of MacGyver as an
older man.  There's no reason to be worried about whether Charles will
make it.  He can do anything, and he knows it.
     And it's too bad that there isn't more drama to the characters in THE
EDGE, because in concept and execution it's often a thrilling adventure.
Director Lee Tamahori (ONCE WERE WARRIORS) crafts some fine action
sequences, notably those involving the survivors' ongoing battle with a
mythically persistent man-eating bear.  As photographed by Donald
McAlpine, THE EDGE is a satisfying experience both visually and
viscerally.
     Intellectually, it's an ambitious disappointment.  Stories set in the
wild usually assume that returning to a state of nature is the only way a
human can survive away from civilization, which makes it refreshing to
find a story which assumes that reason is an even more effective survival
tool.  It's particularly surprising that the writer is Mamet, who has been
known to have his characters turn animalistic while sitting at a desk.
(Which isn't to say that you can't spot a bit of cynicism creeping in --
it's hard to believe that he named his supermodel character "Mickey Morse"
by accident).  But THE EDGE isn't exactly about people forced to live by
their wits.  It's about one man who treats Arctic survival as a routine
open-book test, while a more simple-minded classmate cribs from his
answers.

***1/2 (out of 4) According to the Internet Movie Database, one of the
working titles for THE EDGE was BOOKWORM. Not very exciting, but it does
sum up what is most interesting about the movie, namely the character
Charles Morse, played superbly by Anthony Hopkins. 
In some ways, Charles is similar to Stevens, the character Hopkins
played in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. Both have a quiet dignity; both are
reserved, almost shy, on the surface, but each has a buried pathos that
gives him resounding depth. 
Charles is a millionaire taking a winter holiday with his wife and
friends at a remote cabin in Alaska. His trophy wife Mickey (whom he
actually loves) is here for another reason, too; she is the model for
their photographer friend Bob (Alec Baldwin), who has also come along on
the trip. 
When it comes to his wife, Charles is jealous of everybody, and Bob is
on the top of the list. Hopkins shows you that his character is jealous,
but also, on top of the emotion, he shows you the intellectual man's
struggle to keep the emotion hidden. It is a superb and solid
performance. 
Charles's special talent is that facts stick to his mind like Post-ItŽ
Notes. The cabin's proprietor (L.Q. Jones, who is very good in a small
role) tries to stump Charles with a question about Indian lore: he asks
Charles what's on the opposite side of a paddle that shows a panther.
Charles knows that the counterpart is a rabbit sitting and smoking a
pipe. He even knows that the rabbit is acting casually because the
rabbit knows that it is smarter than the panther, and therefore has
nothing to worry about. 
The next day Charles and three friends set off in search of the
proprietor's Indian friend, who has the perfect face for Bob's camera.
They take the plane to the next lake North, but a flock of birds causes
the plane to crash into the ice-cold water. Three survive the crash and
realize that no rescue party will be coming, at least not very soon. If
they are to survive the cold (and the bears), they will need to rely on
their wits and their survival knowledge (i.e., on Charles). 
Much has been said of their nemesis, a bear with a taste for human
flesh. The bear was a convincing character, but he is not the only
conflict these men face. Panic, wounds, cold, fear, hunger, jealousy,
and greed all work against the survival of the men. None of the
conflicts they face, with the possible exception of the bear, feels
contrived or written. Each problem feels like a genuine obstacle to
survival, and each brings new panic, new fear, and in Charles' case, a
new chance to test his mind. 
I think one of the more interesting scenarios in fiction asks you how
you would handle it if you were REALLY put to the test. Some examples
that come to my mind are Steven King's THE STAND in which 99% of the
human population is wiped out. How would you handle being the last
person alive in your town? Or James Clavell's KING RAT, in which POWs
live in unbearable conditions of disease and starvation. Would you
retreat into insanity or would you fight to survive? 
THE EDGE, pits man against the Alaskan winter without the tools of
civilization to help him survive. Would you panic or could you think
your way out? 
The scenario alone would make an interesting movie, but because the hero
is a smart man instead of a strong man or a lucky man, the movie is even
more interesting, more tangible, more approachable. THE EDGE is not a
disaster movie like DANTE'S PEAK or TWISTER, where only luck or
superheroism can overcome the awesome forces of nature. Instead, man
overcomes nature calmly, slowly, and realistically. It doesn't take a
dashing young hero, it takes a calm, quiet, 50-year old man, who tries
to teach his friends "what one man can do, another can do." 
There is something of a twist at the ending. In general, I don't mind
giving away endings - there's usually enough ironic foreshadowing that
knowing about the ending actually helps you appreciate the rest of the
movie. But in this one, I was glad I had to guess, and so I won't
discuss the wonderful foreshadowing Tamahori and writer David Mamet put
in the movie. But thinking back, there were scenes and lines early on
that take on new significance knowing the outcome of the movie. 
And after the plot twist, the movie continues on for a bit longer. When
the survivors return home, they talk to the press, and what they say
makes one of the best endings to a film I've ever seen. Think about the
last line of the movie and all the meanings it can have - as intended,
as it COULD be interpreted by the audience, and as interpreted by the
press.  
THE EDGE is really a very good movie, and it may make a few "10 best"
lists, including this one. But I must fault it for a clumsy setup. The
movie really gets interesting after the plane crash. It takes 20 to 30
minutes to get to that point, and that first setup is essential to the
story. But it is clear that the beginning is a necessary evil that
clashes with the tone of the rest of the film. 
Still, I can't think of any better way to introduce the necessary traits
of the characters. And the characters and portrayals are what really
sets this movie apart, so the fact that there are two disjointed acts
doesn't need to be a major criticism. 
And if that's all that's wrong with a movie, you've got something worth
seeing.

I swear I have seen The Edge before.  In fact, it reminded me of THE
BEAR, THE RIVER WILD, and other various films mixed into an entirely
different film.  However, The Edge has done something that most action
films should do, and that is add heart and characters we like to the
plot.  In doing so, The Edge draws many more suspenseful moments out
of cliched scenes than, say, THE PEACEMAKER.  Unfortunately, because
of those overused moments, we can pretty much guess the outcome of the
film.  But leave it to screenwriter David Mamet to add humor and a few
surprises to mess with your head.  One surprise, in particular, left
me smiling just because Mamet actually had the guts to add it to his
script.
Action films are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, and while they are
somewhat successful at entertaining us, they lack the one thing which
would make them a more respected genre: intelligence.  Even horror
films have learned this, a genre which is probably the least respected
of them all.  THE RIVER WILD was one of the best action/suspense films
I have seen from the 90s.  The intelligence of the screenplay, and the
suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to
this day.  The Edge has the intelligence and smart characters, but
this time the lack of originality is the downfall.  I must admit that
it was very suspenseful, and had an original third half, but the first
hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes.  This is an
example of the final act saving the film, instead of the other way
around (as in The Lost World).  If only the screenplay had maintained
the final thirty minutes' intensity, it could have become a great
action film (and I use the term loosely).
The Edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film.  But taking
SCREAM's lead, The Edge makes fun of the genre's cliches, and then
uses them (though not quite as effectively).  Charles Morse (Anthony
Hopkins) is the main character, a rich and very intelligent man who
wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to
him.  For once, we don't immediately care for the main character.
Instead, we like Bob (Alec Baldwin), a photographer who is going to
take pictures of Charles' wife, Mickey (Elle MacPherson), out in the
wilderness.  They board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the
Arctic.  Charles' birthday is the same day, and he receives a gold
watch from his wife, and a pocket knife from Bob.  As action films go,
these items do have importance to the rest of the story, but quite a
bit more than we first expect.
Soon, however, Bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because
of his "personality."  Charles, Bob, Bob's assistant Steve (Harold
Perrineau), and the pilot head off to find him, and as shown in the
previews, hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter.  Down the
plane goes, the pilot is killed, and the three are left to survive in
the wilderness.  Director Lee Tamahori is aware of the silly plot
which is about to follow, and therefore has to create original ways to
approach the situations.  He succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the
film.  Take, for instance, the entire man-hunting bear plot.  This has
been done many times in films with different animals, and even bears.
But given the Charles' intelligence, and Bob's uncertainty, many of
the cliches are given fresh twists.  Even Charles himself seems to
have seen these action films before.  My favorite line of the film
comes from Charles: "Most people die in the wilderness because they
didn't do the one thing that could save their life... thinking."
Despite the predictability of the main plot, a subplot develops late
in the film which took me by surprise, and made me smile when I
realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore.  I have to write
cautiously as to not reveal this surprise, so instead I will avoid it
entirely.  The first two-thirds of The Edge have many humorous moments
to push it along, and some of Charles' survival techniques seem
possible, even making fire from ice.  Tamahori is able to create a lot
of suspense from the stalking bear, but whenever the bear is present,
the characters lose all sensibility.  I have always wondered why
characters in films walk over a log to get across water.  Why not do
what an intelligent person would and crawl across?  I guess getting
chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while.
Thankfully, we already have begun to care for the characters, and so
we let this small detail slide.  But some of the technical details are
awkward, such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that Charles
and Bob make (where did they get thread and needles?).
The acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this
nature, and borders on phenomenal.  Anthony Hopkins gives a terrific
performance, creating his most likeable and layered character since
REMAINS OF THE DAY.  Hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles,
but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy, something he
definitely did not do in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Alec Baldwin gives one
of his best performances I have ever seen (it sure is better from his
FAIR GAME).  Baldwin can be a good or a bad character, and here he
succeeds at both in a way.  You can never quite guess if he is a nice
or a vllainous character until the end, and Baldwin is able to handle
the double-natured photographer.  Elle MacPherson gives a good
performance, albeit slight.  She isn't in the film all that much, but
for the scenes she does have, she handles as an actress, not as a
model.  Harold Perrineau is a good actor, and his scenes are nice and
underplayed.  He is eliminated early, and I reveal nothing by saying
this because it is inevitable and predictable.
The Edge is rated R for graphic violence, some gore, and language.
Some of the violence is a little too disturbing, even for me.  This
film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to,
but too many cliches bog it down.  Director Tamahori has created a
very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts.  David
Mamet's script, though, has a lot of humor to keep the first hour
afloat, and the acting is solid.  The best thing about the script is
the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action
sequence, but with a small detail involving a certain gift.  It's a
nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear.
And by the way, most people laughed when the film faded to black due
to a large credit to Bart the bear.  Way to go, Bart.

THE EDGE
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 20th Century Fox
 Director:  Lee Tamahori
 Writer:  David Mamet
 Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Elle Macpherson,
Harold Perrineau, L.Q. Jones, Bart the Bear.
   It's no fun being a billionaire.  You'll have lots of friends and
a gorgeous wife, but do they really like you?  You can't blame
the fabulously rich Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) for
seeming paranoid.  He thinks everyone is out to use him; he's
suspicious at all times of the behavior of his much younger
wife; he decides to take a trip to Alaska with his friend Robert
Green (Alec Baldwin) to see how she, Mickey (Elle
Macpherson), acts in his presence.
   If you came into "The Edge" a few minutes late, you might
swear you're seeing a sequel to "The Game."  Rich man,
complacent, intellectual, competent, has a hotshot lawyer, a
trophy wife, a pilot and then some to take care of his needs. 
Suddenly thrust into a life-threatening predicament, he must
use his wits and his animal instincts to avoid death at the
hands of both man and beast. If he survives, he'll have
changed his life.  In the midst of peril, Charles indeed says, "I
never knew anyone who changed their life. I'm going to
change my life."  
   Aware that conflict is essential to drama, writer David
Mamet and director Lee Tamahori underscore all three
models of strife: man against man, man against nature, man
against himself--pitting a rich bookworm against a Kodiak bear
(Bart) described as a "man-killing machine"; against his
traveling companion Bob, who turns out to be other than he
seems; and against his own reserve and bookishness. 
Originally entitled "The Bookworm," the action-adventure
movie features the writing of David Mamet, whose dialogue,
however appropriate, is not his usual edgy stuff.  In fact there
is only one point in the film that you'll recognize his signature
exchange: when a startled Bob looks at Charles and says,
"Why did you say 'how will you kill me'...why did you say
that?"
   You'll find none of the sharp exchanges familiar to theater
fans of Mamet's "Oleanna" or "Sexual Perversity in Chicago"
or "American Buffalo"  Movies, however, are a visual medium,
and the lack of quirky talk is compensated for by
cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine's wide-lens, alpine
shots of the Canadian province of Alberta (which stands in for
Alaska) and by Neil Travis's tense editing, the story unfolding
to Jerry Goldsmith's unobtrusive, appropriate soundtrack.
   "The Edge" opens on the Alaskan frontier as a private
plane carrying Charles, his supermodel wife Mickey, Mickey's
photographer Bob, the photographer's assistant Stephen
(Harold Perrineau) pulls up to the rugged cabin owned by the
scarred and leathered Styles (L.Q. Jones).  The team are on
a mission to scout out some awesome locations for shots of
Mickey in a variety of outfits.  Bob insists on taking a short
flight to the cabin of an Indian, who, he explains, would make
a perfect prototype for some photos.  The aircraft is hit by a
flocks of big birds, making a crash landing in the remote
wilderness, an area unlikely to be discovered by any rescue
party.  The men must live by their wits, facing starvation and,
more imminently, a series of attacks by a Kodiak bear which
prefers human meat to fish.  A scene involving the men
running from the 1400-pound animal is among the scariest of
its kind ever shown on the screen, a feat made possible by
the superb training of Bart the bear by Doug Seus and, where
necessary, the use of an animatronic bear created by
Animated Engineering.  The quieter moments are made
humorous by Charles's pithy remarks about surviving in the
wilderness, a skill he derives purely from the extraordinary
number of books he has read and not from actual experience. 
"The inside of a banana peel will shine your shoes," he
advises during more peaceful moments, and when a fire is
needed and matches are scarce, he counsels, "You can make
a fire from ice" (by carving a block into a lens and focusing
the sun's rays).  He is not always successful: at one point he
makes a compass by magnetizing a needle which he carries
around with him and placing it on a leaf in the water.  Most of
all, he suggests, the principal reason people who are lost will
die is from shame--from the feeling that "I got myself into this
mess and deserve what happens."  
   "The Edge" is really two films in one: the first part dealing
with their meetings with a huge, determined bear; the second
with a cat-and-mouse game between Bob and Charles--the
latter firmly believing that his "pal" is out to kill him for his wife
and perhaps for his money.  "Do you think it's pleasant to be
rich?" he asks rhetorically, having experienced courtesy,
friendliness and enthusiasm from others in his life who, it later
turns out, were interested in him only for his assets.
   Both halves of "The Edge" are gripping, featuring the duo of
opposites, Bob and Charles, playing their macabre games
with each other, first cooperating and then scheming.  The
picture might have been ideal for an audience of young as
well as old, but has an "R" rating because of strong language. 
As it stands, the movie is thoroughly mainstream, with
smashing scenery, head-on conflicts, and just the right
measure of comic colloquy.  Rated R.  Running Time: 117
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten

(1997, one of two films with this title)
  Seen on 20 September 1997 at the Cineplex Baronet Coronet for $8.75 as a
  Sneak Preview.
   Thriller. Suvival. Wilderness. Bear. Those are the terms the Internet
   Movie Database uses to categorize The Edge, and boy, never were they
   more accurate. Initially, the commercials for this movie made it look
   like another dopey "two rivals fight in the deep woods, plus a
   grizzly" film. The lure of two-for-the-price-of-one brought me in, and
   I am glad I knew next to nothing before entering the theatre.
   In a nutshell, older gazillionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) and
   his much younger model wife (Elle Macpherson) come to the world's
   largest log cabin for a photoshoot, along with the photographer (Bob,
   played by Alec Baldwin), his assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau Jr.),
   and various other personnel. Charles has a voracious appetite for
   knowledge and always has his nose in an informative book, but he also
   notices that his wife and Bob are way too chummy.
   Charles, Bob, and Stephen take on an impromptu adventure to find a
   lone hunter to be a model turns deadly as their small pontoon plane
   goes down (stunning homage to Hitchcock, that scene). The pilot dies;
   the other three have to figure out how they are going to get back to
   the lodge. Oh, and a gigantic bear (Bart the Bear) is after them. All
   this might sound like a vague improvement on The River Wild, but it
   far exceeds that sort of parallel thanks to riveting direction by
   relative nobody Lee Tamahori and an intelligent screenplay by David
   Mamet.
   What the commercials do not show is the presence of Stephen; it only
   shows Bob and Charles as rivals. Watching the billionaire bookworm
   take charge of their survival is interesting. If it were me, I'd be
   dead in about a half hour. Charles forces the men to participate in
   their own survival.
   The only intelligent line in Copland (the next movie I saw) is that
   despite technological and other advances, the human thought process is
   still rather primitive. Watching Hopkins play a man who has every
   reason to be less than civilized while poised to fight his rival in
   circumstances that would allow less than refined behavior is
   fascinating. But it is not a big intellectual exercise; The Edge
   provides one of the best edge-of-your-seat movies I have seen in
   years. Tamahori comes very close to being the next potential
   Hitchcock, giving the sort of thrills humanity gave up when they gave
   up hunting in favor of agriculture.
   The Edge takes none of the turns you might expect. The breathtaking
   woods of Alberta are not forced to carry the film. Anthony Hopkins
   once again proves why he is one of the best actors of our day, adding
   another wonderful performance to a pantheon of memorable characters.
   Alec Baldwin surprises also, and the hitherto unknown (to me) Harold
   Perrineau Jr. was equally good. Elle Macpherson serves her purpose, if
   you were wondering.

Interesting note: David Mamet, the writer of this movie, is a renowned
American playwright who was born in Chicago in 1947. Mamet is best known
for slick macho city guy characters and their egos and posturing. He won
a Pulitzer Prize for Glengarry Glen Ross. His films include The
Verdict,' The Untouchables,' The Postman Always Rings Twice,' and
Hoffa.'
Ingredients: 
A bookworm, a sleazeball who covets the bookworm's wife, a plane crash,
lots of Alaskan wilderness, a man-eating bear
Synopsis: 
Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) is a wealthy but socially awkward
bookworm who suspects his beautiful supermodel wife (Elle Macpherson)
might be having an affair with virile morally bankrupt photographer
Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). From this point on, foreshadowing is the
name of the game. While on a plane, Charles happens to be reading a book
called "How to Survive in the Wilderness." And in the first few minutes
of the movie, the dialogue between various characters covers the fact
that birds can cause a plane to crash, and that bears in Alaska
sometimes stalk human victims.  So from the very start, we can guess
what will happen to a tiny bush plane carrying both Charles and Robert
over Alaska for a photo shoot. The trouble is, Charles' wife and Robert
are far from virtuous. Will Robert take the opportunity to kill off
Charles? Will a bear kill them both? Will they kill the bear? All we in
the audience have to do now is sit back, live theater style, and watch
the actors and the bear hash out their differences.
Opinion:
It seems like every word spoken or every action taken in the beginning
of the 'The Edge' - - no matter how insignificant - -  is foreshadowing
for something that occurs before the movie ends. Not a word is wasted.
Even when Charles receives an engraved timepiece it's really just
foreshadowing for the presenting of an engraved timepiece later on in
the story. This "Murphy's Law" quality, as every single word or action
comes back to haunt, makes the movie seem more tongue-in-cheek. Envision
two men on a park bench acting out a dramatic situation concerning a
wife, and then place the men on a log in the middle of the Alaskan
forest instead. Throw in a few homicidal bear attacks and see how they
get out of each dilemma.

The Edge (R) ** (out of ****)
        Following test screenings, the title of Lee Tamahori's
survival-in-the-wilds thriller Bookworm was changed to the presumably more
slam-bang The Edge.  However, this is a case where the original title
should have remained, for the staid-sounding Bookworm is a more apt moniker
for this unexciting adventure yarn.
        Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Charles Morse, the bookworm of the original
title, a billionaire who has acquired a wealth of knowledge from the
reading of numerous books.  The film begins with Charles arriving in Alaska
with his much younger model wife, Mickey (Elle Macpherson, displaying all
the depth of a fashion plate)--yes, her name is _Mickey_Morse_--and ace
fashion photographer Robert Green (Alec Baldwin) for a shoot.  Screenwriter
David Mamet's creaky plot machinations can be heard early on with the very
weak setup for the wilderness action: determined to locate a particularly
photogenic local to join Mickey for the shoot, Robert, with trusty
assistant Stephen (Harold Parrineau) and Charles along for the ride, leaves
the cushy cabin lodgings on a plane, which promptly crashes in the middle
of nowhere.  Can these three survive on their own in the Alaskan
wilderness, with a very hungry bear on their trail?
        Actually, the question is really if these _two_ can survive, since it's
thunderingly obvious that Stephen won't be around for long because (1) the
tension brewing between Charles and Robert over Mickey has to take center
stage sooner or later, and (2) Stephen is African-American.  And the
answer, of course, is a big yes since Charles has learned volumes of
survival know-how from books--we see him make a compass using a paper clip
and a leaf in water as well as recite a particularly clever formula for
making fire from ice.  Before long, we get the point: it takes brains, not
necessarily brawn, to survive in the wild.  But Mamet and Tamahori keep on
pounding that point into the audience's heads as if we were an opponent
needing to be pummeled into submission.
        Tamahori does bring The Edge to life during some spectacular bear attack
sequences.  This may sound a little silly, but Bart the Bear delivers the
film's most memorable performance as Charles and Robert's (and, for a
while, Stephen's) bloodthirsty stalker; big, brown, and very, very
intimidating, he gives his scenes an electrifying jolt of energy.
Unfortunately, the bear is not the focus of the film; the Charles-Robert
conflict is, and once the bear situation has come to a head, all that
follows cannot help but feel a bit a dull by comparison.  This would not
have been as big of a problem if the Charles-Robert conflict came to a
moderately satisfying, halfway exciting conclusion, but, not so
surprisingly, everything ends with a whimper.
        Which leaves the audience wondering--what exactly does the title mean?
The edge of sanity?  The edge of the world?  Perhaps one, perhaps the
other, perhaps both, but all I know is that by the time The Edge was over,
I was at the edge of my patience.

Written by David Mamet (The Spanish Prisoner)
Starring Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Alec Baldwin (The Juror),
Elle MacPherson (If Lucy Fell), Harold Perrineau Jr. ("Oz")
What do you get when you combine a bear, a man that may or may not want to
kill another for his wife, and an entrapanuer with a seemingly infinite
wealth of knowledge? Ask me that a month ago and I'd say that I wouldn't see
a movie with that plotline if you paid me. But after a barrage of good
advertising and even better hype, I decided that I'd go see it.
What a surprise.
The movie starts slow, but with that kind of unwritten tension in the air
that only a good writer can accomplish. It picks up speed quickly, spending
maybe half an hour on the intro and character development to the final crash
(due to an in-air collision with a flock of birds) which kills the pilot and
leaves Harold Perrineau Jr. ("Oz"), Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins alive
to fend in the wilderness with a knife and six matches.
Things would go better except for the fact that there is a Kodaik bear, a
mankiller who is stocking them, giving off all of the personality of a
psychopath and making us hate him as much as we could hate any human
villain.
Though the plot is completely made of old movies, this is one that is done
so well that it surpasses any old no-tech thriller that I've ever seen. It
goes into the realm of movies that are made good but have tremendous
potential to be bad. It's worth seeing any day of the week.

cast: Anthony Hopkins (Charles Morse), Alec Baldwin (Robert Green), Elle 
Macpherson (Mickey Morse), Harold Parrineau Jr. (Stephen).
written by David Mamet
directed by Lee Tomahori
"If you go out in the woods today, you're in for a big surprise..."
Billionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) has descended upon the 
Alaskan wilderness for his supermodel wife's (Elle Macpherson - 
surprised?) layout shoot with studly photographer Robert Green (Alec 
Baldwin - more surprised?) and his staff.  Tension mounts as Macpherson, 
who is decades younger than her sugar daddy husband, seems to get along 
quite well with her photographer buddy.
"It's lovely in the woods today, but its safer to stay inside..."
We learn that we are in store for some wilderness action in 
the first five minutes.  Talk about harbingers of doom!  Morse's 
secretary gave him a deep woods survival book for his birthday.  In the 
meantime, all we hear about is the great Kodiak bear, or what the guide 
calls the "man eater."
"For every bear that ever there was, will gather there for certain, 
because..."
In order to lure Morse away from camp, Robert feigns dissatisfaction 
with his model and seeks an Indian to pose for him.  To do so, they need 
to take a small propeller plane with Stephen (Harold Parrineau), the 
assistant, eighty miles north, for what "will take just two hours."  Sure 
it will.  In the plane, Robert expresses jealousy of Morse's life.  At 
this point, Morse asks, "So, how are you going to kill me?"  
Simultaniously, the plane takes a plunge and they are lost.  All but the 
pilot survive and the action-adventure begins.  Yay!
"Today's the day the teddy-bears have their picnic!"
With our three survivors as the main course, apparently.  I am 
telling you, this bear is a menace that just will not go away.  To 
transform this into a buddy flic, a point that Robert alludes to later 
on, Stephen has to be killed.  He was the whiner anyway, so he was 
expendable.  (Read that: he's not the star.)  So, what ensues is a slow 
moving, seldomly exciting, but mostly plodding movie with quite a 
predictable twist.  In what seems to be an endless trek through the woods 
is saved by the discovery of an abandoned shack, chock full of supplies.  
Included in this miracle kit is a canoe and a map.  How fortunate!
Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, who brings integrity to each of 
his roles.  In this weak picture, he plays an imperialistic aficionado of 
exotic cultures, exuding stodginess.  It is not until the tension rises 
that he gains a sense of humor.  He is all that we could ask for in a 
billionaire with a trophy wife, oodles of possessions, and a vault of 
trivial knowledge.  I must say, though, that it was nice to see the old 
guy in the movie not needing his pills or a respirator when the going got 
tough.
Baldwin played a naive wimp for most of the movie, a nice change 
that is destroyed as we progress.  He is not as nice as he would like us 
to believe, pushing his character to the shadows of previous tough guy 
roles.  Except now, he is tough and bad!  The early part allows an actor 
to glimmer through, and not just a piece of meat strutting on screen.  
Now he needs a meaty role for his next movie, so we do not tire of him 
completely.
Third billing should have gone to Bart the Bear, who held as the 
growling scene stealer.  However, he seems to be a one dimensional 
actor.  Not to worry, third billing went to Elle Macpherson, who showed 
some stupendous range.  She is playing a supermodel named Mickey Morse!  
What kind of acting move is that?  Are we to take her seriously?  She had 
very little time on screen and very little on during her screen time.  
While she did not act much, we did get a veiled peek at her talents: all 
two of them.
It was not a horrible movie, but is one that will be easy to mock.  
Once you find out the twist about the plane "accident" (did I ruin it?) 
you will see why the movie is tough to find remotely interesting.  It is 
apparently more than just a survivor's tale, it is a story about deceit 
and honor.  We have seen this most recently in "Cop Land" and "L.A. 
Confidential."  Right versus might.  Those films had better deliveries 
and payoffs, though.  "The Edge" just gets more boring as we proceed step 
by painful step.
With shoddy dialogue, we expect more from writer David Mamet.  He 
has written "The Untouchables" and was Oscar-nominated for "The 
Verdict."  Perhaps the biggest weakness can be found in director Lee 
Tomahori, who guided the snooze-fest "Mulholland Falls."  This guy has an 
ear for the extremely boring.
If you want an action movie, you will find the attackes to be few 
and far between.  If you want action with intelligence, as this movie 
claims it is, search long and hard to find a theater still showing 
"Face/Off."

It's difficult to imagine a screenwriter like David Mamet not receiving the
respect he deserves from the Hollywood community.  In 1992 he presented two
screenplays which made one good and one great film.  'Hoffa', the good film
starring Jack Nicholson was an original screenplay written by Mamet based on
the real life Teamsters president and the great film was 'Glengarry Glen
Ross' based on Mamet's own Pulitzer Prize-winning play.  Mamet received no
Oscar nomination for either script.  In fact, I believe Mamet has only been
nominated once for adapting 1982's 'The Verdict' from Barry Reed's novel.
 Mamet also adapted 1987's 'The Untouchables' for the big screen.  Mamet
wrote and skillfully directed 1991's 'Homicide' which made many '10 best
lists' about a Chicago policeman coming to terms with his faith and his
duties of conscience.  Mamet is the finest writer in Hollywood along with
other greats like William Goldman, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone and the Coen
Brothers.  All of these people have won Oscars for their writing but not
Mamet.  To many the Academy Award is of no great importance but even though
some say it's no big deal, they're liars if they don't feel a certain sense
of pride in being recognized by their peers.
In 'The Edge', Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin star as two men eventually
trapped in the Alaskan wilderness (the film was in fact shot in Alberta,
Canada) and they fight to survive the climate, hunger, the lack of shelter
and the occasional bear !  The story begins at a vacation getaway where we
learn that Hopkins is a billionaire married to a fashion model (Elle
Macpherson) and there are other assorted friends and business associates
tagging along including a fashion photographer, played by Baldwin who has an
eye for Hopkins' wife.  Baldwin suggests that he and Hopkins and another man
go on a short plane ride to visit a native American whom Baldwin feels will
be instrumental in photographing for his most recent layout.  Their plane
crashes and the pilot is killed and the third man along with Hopkins and
Baldwin is mauled by a bear leaving Hopins and Baldwin to fight for
themselves.  Before the plane crashes, Hopkins hints that Baldwin's agenda
for the trip is to kill him in order to claim his wife the fortune she will
possess.  
The interesting thing about this movie is that Hopkins plays his role of the
billionaire as a man who always desired to have something unlikely happen to
him so while he would like to be rescued eventually, the audience sees him
almost enjoying the challenge of being put to the test for his time in the
wilderness and his character never loses his cool and by recognizing the
potential of becoming a victim of his own panic and avoiding any sense of
shame that may do him in makes his character noble and beyond the stereotype
many have of the wealthy.  Baldwin's character is not nearly as interesting
but he pulls off his role with a passing grade.
David Mamet has addressed all the important formulas in screen writing such
as grabbing audience attention within the first ten minutes, having a plot
point turn setting up the important part of the story at about the half hour
point, keeping his writing alive and addressing the three basic points of
conflict, man vs. man., man vs. nature and man vs. himself.  With stimulating
direction from Lee Tamahori and sensational photography to boot, 'The Edge'
is a gripping morality tale which is absorbing, convincing and ends perfectly
in a very subtle fashion.

THE EDGE
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
Directed by Lee Tamahori
        There's something irresistibly intriguing about the idea of a
wilderness-survival story penned by playwright David Mamet ("Glengarry
Glen Ross") and featuring the anything-but-rough-and-tumble Anthony
Hopkins in the lead. The concept seems so far-fetched it leads "The
Edge" some certifiable curiosity value right from the start. Add in the
intensity of Mr. Actors' Studio himself, Alec Baldwin, and you know you
must be in for a wild ride.
        Or perhaps not. The most startling thing about "The Edge" is how
traditional the whole thing seems. Bookwormish Hopkins and oily
fashion-photographer Baldwin, stranded in the Canadian countryside after
a plane crash, confront a variety of dangers and --- in typical Mamet
style --- have to get in touch with their inner manliness before they
can
return to civilization. A few scattered profanities, a couple of gory
accidents and a subplot about suspected adultery are all that separates
this story from the grade-school classic "My Side of the Mountain."
        Mamet's screenplay seems to have something it wants to say about
the
changing definitions of manhood, but his message never quite comes
through as director Lee Tamahori keeps interrupting the story for
regular visits from a cranky Kodiak who seems to get his kicks out of
terrorizing our heroes. The bear attacks get progressively sillier and
less believable until the inevitable final confrontation, a moment that
requires an enormous suspension of disbelief.
        "The Edge" is on steadier ground dealing with its human
characters:
Although neither of them is particularly amiable, both have some
unexpected dimensions, and Hopkins and Baldwin deliver nuanced
performances. Another major plus is the movie's gorgeous photography
which makes the wilds of Alberta look like a great place to get lost in.

The Edge is a beautifully photographed action thriller. There are two
strings of plot that run through the film, the biggest of them is of
survival. The other is about being rich. Who can you trust if you were a
multi-millionaire? Do people talk to you only because you're rich? Did that
pretty model marry because of your money? Life seems rough when you're rich.
The Edge follows the life of a multimillionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony
Hopkins), who is on a trip to the wilderness because his model wife has a
photo shoot with photographer Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). After the shoot
with Charles' wife, Robert wants to go find an old Indian bear hunter for
another shoot. Before going of to find the Indian, he invites Charles
along, and Charles agrees. They fly out to find the Indian, but catastrophe
happens and the plane crashes. Charles is an avid reader and has all sorts
of knowledge stored up in his head, including enough knowledge to help get
Robert, Stephen (Harold Perrineau Jr., who plays Robert's assistant), and
himself out of the wilderness.
The Edge starts out a little slow, but quickly picks up pace when a
specific character is introduced. This amazing character would be the
man-eating bear (Bart the bear) that is stalking Robert, Charles and
Stephen. Whenever the story gets a little slow, Bart the bear is called in
to help quicken the pace. And that he does just that. Bart the bear creates
some genuinely frightening and white knuckled moments.
There is a plot thread about Robert having an affair with Charles' wife,
and planning to kill Charles so that he can get both the woman and the
money. This plot thread is introduced early on in the film, but is left to
smoulder while Bart the bear thrills us. But, as I thought that the plot
thread was merely dropped it shows up again, and provides some good tension
between Robert and Charles.
The Edge is beautifully photographed, and there has to be lots of kudos
given to the cinematographer, Donald McAlpine. He captures the beauty of
the wilderness and never misses a chance to put in more. The film is
beautiful. Lee Tamahori (Mulholland Falls) does a great job at keeping the
pace of the movie quick and crisp. Though the beginning is a little slow,
he manages to move past it rather well. Tamahori handles the action
sequences very well, and is able to create some high tension during some
scenes.
The score by Jerry Goldsmith is worth mentioning also. The score fits the
movie well. The score is broad and moody just like the film. And the score
never becomes overbearing.
The two real reasons to see The Edge are for Anthony Hopkins and Bart the
bear. Hopkins gives a good multi-leveled performance. His performance is
the one that the film rides on, and he does exceptionally well. When we
look into his eyes, and listen to him state something on screen, we can
also see that he is stating something but his mind is focused on figuring
out what's ahead of that. Bart the bear is also a good reason to see The
Edge. He is mighty scary, and worth the price of admission itself.
The one person that I found as the weak link was Alec Baldwin. Maybe I'm
just used to seeing him in a more take-control part, but the whiner that he
plays in The Edge just doesn't work. He tries to be a whiner, but it never
comes off as being genuine. Baldwin hasn't had any good films lately, his
best role ever, for me, was his role as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red
October. And though I didn't think he fit his role in The Edge, this is one
of his better and more memorable performances in the long while since The
Hunt for Red October.
The Edge is a highly entertaining movie about the survival of men in the
wilderness. It starts off slow but quickly picks up the pace. Its action is
thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat while its beautiful
photography will take your breath away. Hopkins is the star of the film,
and he does a great job with his role. Don't miss this film in the theatres.

This is the tale of survival in the wilderness: men against bear. No, wait,
it's really about of two rivals for the same woman. No, no, the real story is
a man's discovery of his unknown inner resources. Hold on, it's "Grizzly
Adams" but with big town socialites.
It's truly all of these things and this is a prime example of the whole being
lesser than the sum of the parts. 
Although the Canadian Rockies scenery (standing in for the film's Alaska) is
magnificent, in typical David Mamet form, the movie could be a filmed play.
There are only two main characters (three, if you count the bear) and the
supposed focus in on the interaction between them.
Bookwormish billionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) decides to go on
location with his trophy wife, super model Mickey (Elle MacPherson) to Alaska.
His hidden motive is to find out if the ultra babe is making time with her
photographer Bob Green (Alec Baldwin).
This rapidly takes a back seat when a plane with the billionaire (but not his
wife - this is not "Gilligan's Island"), the photographer and his assistant
crash lands in the wilderness, miles from civilization. Now survival is all
that matters and when a man-eating Kodiak bear shows up, the rivalry is all
but forgotten.
As the two stars and the "other guy" emerge from the wreckage, it's
reminiscent of the original "Star Trek" series when the Kirk, Spock and Scotty
beams down to a new planet with an unnamed crew member. You know that it's
just a matter of time before you hear "He's dead, Jim" and there's no question
who the statement is about.
Luckily for the group, Morse has a photographic memory and even better, he's
just been reading a book on how to survive when lost in the wilds. Before you
know it, there's a compass made from a paper clip, navigating by the stars and
talk of making a fire from an ice lens. All this from a guy who describes
himself as having no imagination.
Much has been made as to this film being the story of the triumph of the
thinking man over nature. While this is certainly a portion of what is going
on, other aspects of the human condition are just as important to survival.
The high point of the movie is two men fighting a monstrous bear armed with
only sharpened burnt sticks and a plan. While they do have a blueprint for
their battle, it would never work unless they reach down inside to come up
with the primal energy for the combat.
There's a good film hidden inside of this mish-mash. For a few minutes before
the bear battle until about a half hour afterwards, a mini-movie exists that,
had it been all there was, could be highly recommended.
Unfortunately before that point there are far too many scenes of "Oh no, we're
going to die!" "No, we're not. We have to push on." Then a different person
flips out and another pulls him together. And then it happens again and again.
We get the message the first time. It might be realistic, but not everything
that could possibly happen has to end up on film.
Later in the film as the confrontation between Morse and Green heats up, the
movie falls apart. Not much is believable and, even worse, we don't care.
Hopkins is a fine actor and his presence is almost enough to carry the film.
Almost. His reluctant hero is credible and the transformation meaningful. The
film would have worked better if he had to struggle alone.
Baldwin is usually at least adequate in his roles, but doesn't do well with
what is admittedly a character without much to offer. It doesn't help that the
adversarial relationship between the men is much less interesting than when
they work together.
The rest of the actors have mere bit parts. MacPherson has shown some talent
in other films, but here her function is the same as the mountains: something
nice to look at.
The big star of the film is the extraordinarily beautiful scenery, but that's
not enough to make it work. It would be nice to also have a plot that held our interest.

     Where is Davy Crockett when you need him?  As we children of the
50s know, Davy "killed him a bear (pronounced "bar") when he was only
three."  The simplistic story for THE EDGE -- men get lost in the
wilderness, bear chases men, men chase bear -- has men who are in
desperate need of a bear exterminator.
     Although the story sounds like a children's wilderness yarn, this
one was written for an older crowd.  In a minor subplot, there may or
may not be a love triangle and an associated murder plot.  From the
show's trailers possible murderous intentions seem to be the heart of
the film, but they aren't.  Endless chase scenes of man and bear are.
     The biggest surprise in the film are the names of the writer and
the director.  The writer, David Mamet, is one of the best
screenwriters and playwrights working today.  His cinematic body of
work includes THE VERDICT, THE UNTOUCHABLES, GLENGARRY GLEN
ROSS,
THINGS CHANGE and, my personal favorite, HOUSE OF GAMES.  The
director,
Lee Tamahori, burst onto the movie scene with his uniformly praised
ONCE WERE WARRIORS.  (Granted, his only other film, MULHOLLAND
FALLS,
is an unmemorable exercise in style.)  Together these brilliant men
have managed to fashion a mediocre tale of wilderness survival.
     The only outstanding part of the movie is the breathtaking, aerial
cinematography by Donald McAlpine, whose previous picture was last
year's gorgeous ROMEO + JULIET.  The rest of the film, although
pleasant enough, has little to recommend it.
     The story opens with a billionaire named Charles Morse flying to a
remote cabin nestled between snow crusted mountains.  Morse is played
with his usual charm by Anthony Hopkins in the only interesting
performance in the film.  Charles's hobby is knowing everything about
everything, especially about wilderness survival.  He knows the tricks
people have used throughout history to survive, and this knowledge soon
proves invaluable.
     Accompanying him is his beautiful wife, Mickey, played by Elle
Macpherson.  Mickey is a fashion model who is there to shoot a photo
spread in the woods.  She is accompanied by her photographer, Robert
"Bob" Green (Alec Baldwin) and Robert's aide Stephen (Harold Perrineau
Jr.), whose only purpose in the film is to be the expendable one.
Baldwin plays his role rather laconically instead of imbuing his
character with the mystery called for.
     On a flight to find an Indian to put in the picture with Mickey, a
plane with just the men aboard crashes.  The three men then set off on
their quest to be rescued beginning with a lecture from Charles on what
happens to most lost people.  "They die of shame," he explains.
"Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives --
thinking."  Well, Charles does their thinking for them, including
creating a compass from the raw materials at hand.
     The picture has numerous hard-to-believe sequences, but none more
so that the many confrontations with the bear, played by "Bart the
Bear."  I hate to disparage an animal actor, but he looked too much
like the singing animatronic bear from Disneyland's Country Bear
Jamboree to be frightening.  Maybe Bart needed better lines.
     For a wilderness film, it has less tension than most.  Charles and
Bob seem subconsciously confident that their rescuers will eventually
arrive.  "Our friend's a billionaire," is how Bob explains it to
Stephen.  "You know what happens when they misplace one."
     If the studio had misplaced this movie, not much would have been
lost.  And, except for the undeniably beautiful setting, there is
little worth trying to save.
     THE EDGE runs 1:57.  It is rated R for a few gory scenes and some
profanity.  The film would be fine for teenagers.  Although beautiful
to behold, there is not enough compelling material to make the picture
worth recommending.  I give it **.
