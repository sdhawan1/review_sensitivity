Rated R: strong sexual content, nudity, language, drug content, comic violence,
crude humor.
Starring: Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Tom Green, Rachel Blanchard, Fred
Ward, Amy Smart, DJ Qualls, Anthony Rapp, Paulo Costanzo, Andy Dick
Directed by: Todd Phillips
Teen comedies were abundant in 1999, we had "She's All That", "Never Been
Kissed", "10 Things I Hate About You" and so many more....they were good
movies, but the bad things were the PG-13 ratings. I mean a teen's life is not
PG-13 and in 2000 we've had already three PG-13 teen movies, and they will
continue. In July of 1999, a raunchy NC-17 rated film that was all about teens
started to buzz, and was finally cut down to an R and released into theatres.
The film was what a real teens life was all about, no proms (well no good
proms) and no love stories, the film was "American Pie" a classic for the 90's.
It was a straight teen film, and it was a huge hit, which will definately spawn
a ton of copies. The first being the unbelievably funny "Road Trip" a new R
rated teen comedy that comes just at the right time when we are getting tired
or PG-13 teen movies.
Breckin Meyer plays Josh, a student at the University of Ithica in New York.
Josh and his girlfriend are at seperate colleges, but he is bent on staying
faithful, until her roomate tells him that she doesn't want him anymore. His
girlfriend is Tiffany played by the ever so beautiful Rachel Blanchard. Josh
meets Beth (Amy Smart) and the two go to a party, get drunk and make a sex tape
together, only to have his friend Rubin accidentally sends it to Tiffany,
causing Josh, Rubin, E.L. (played hilariously by Seann William Scott) and Kyle
(DJ Qualls) to have to go on a road trip across the country to retrieve the
tape. On the way there they encounter several misadventures that are gut
bustingly funny!
"Road Trip" is smartly written, very well directed, and the cast is having some
fun in their roles. To note Breckin Meyer is a great actor. He is funny, smart
and he fills the screen without getting on our nerves or hoping he was gone.
Seann William Scott was classic in "American Pie" as the sex-luvin Stiffler,
who in the end got what he deserved. Paulo Costanzo is a very talented actor
and fits the role of Rubin quite well, and DJ Qualls is irreplaceable as the
skinny Kyle, who seems to like people not his size.
Even though I didn't think "Road Trip" was as good as "American Pie" it was a
still a fantastic film. At times I almost choked to death from laughing so
hard. Some of you may say will most of this has been done yada yada yada, well
actually yeah it has, but some of these jokes are just so put well that we
forgive their unorginality. The cast is incredinly lovable and seems to be
having great fun with their roles, and Tom Green is just great as Barry the
overaged college student who at the beginning and end of the film is giving a
tour of the school.
I thoroughly enjoyed "Road Trip" it has a few flaws here and there, but its
raunchy and funny, and in the end a sweet love story that we actually get
involved in. Maybe we will get more R rated teen comedies, that actually show
how a teen's life is. A teen's life isnt PG-13 its definately NC-17 or X. I
can't wait now for American Pie 2 next year. Go see "Road Trip"  I guaratee
it's going to be one of the funnest times at the movies in the year 2000.

"Road Trip" is this year's offering to the audience of "There's Something About
Mary" and "American Pie."  Its hero, Josh Porter (Breckin Meyer), attends the
University of Ithaca, New York, while his sweetheart since childhood, Tiffany
(Rachel Blanchard of TV's "Clueless"), goes to the University of Texas at
Austin.  Tiffany hasn't returned any of his calls for awhile, and Josh worries
that she's dumping him for someone else.  He records a video-taped plea for her
attention and asks a friend to mail it.  Later, after hearing that Tiffany
isn't sleeping in her dorm room, Josh succumbs to the advances of Beth (Amy
Smart) and allows her to tape their erotic exploits.  Of course, the wrong
video tape is mailed to Texas, and the road trip is on.  Desperate to retrieve
the tape before Tiffany sees it, Josh sets out to Texas with three companions:
the overly sexed E. L. (Seann William Scott), the overly neurotic Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo), and the overly virginal Kyle (D. J. Qualls).  
Meanwhile, Barry (Tom Green), a space cadet who's been at Ithaca for seven
years, is in charge of feeding a small mouse to Rubin's pet snake.  He's
obsessed with the sick thrill of feeding one live animal to another, and this
chore occupies his attention for most of the movie.  When Beth comes around
looking for Josh, Barry tells her Josh went to see Tiffany in "Austin,
Massachusetts."  Thinking that he means Boston, Beth sets out on a road trip of
her own.  A fourth storyline:  Kyle's domineering dad (Fred Ward) believes that
Kyle has been kidnapped and follows the trail of Josh and the boys.  A fifth: 
a creepy graduate student (Anthony Rapp) who's stalking Beth plots to keep Josh
from passing philosophy.
I remember seeing an interview with Mike Myers about the making of "Wayne's
World."  He said when they finished filming it, it was too short.  So they put
together some more stuff, and it was still too short.  So they put together
some more stuff . . .  A similar process probably followed Todd Phillips and
Scot Armstrong's idea to make a movie about a bunch of guys on a road trip
where funny stuff happens.  Their screenplay seems to follow the "Wayne's
World" model of padding out a thin plot by adding gags.  The material in "Road
Trip" that actually develops the plot or the characters is sparse.  Josh and
his posse make detours as unlikely as selling semen, visiting Barry's
grandparents, and bluffing their way into an all-black fraternity.
The good news:  all those gags that seem thrown in are really funny.  I laughed
throughout the movie, especially during Barry's attempts at feeding the snake
and during a scene where the boys decide to jump Kyle's car over a collapsed
bridge.  If you enjoy the "Something About Mary" style of comedy, you'll have a
good time watching "Road Trip."
Given Tom Green's prominence in the trailers and posters, his fans might expect
his character to be the protagonist or to at least be included in the titular
road trip.  However, despite the fact that his scenes have nothing to do with
the main plot, "Road Trip" cuts back to him frequently, and he provides more
than his share of laughs.  In addition to the snake-feeding subplot, Barry
appears in a framing sequence in which he relates the tale of the road trip to
a group of prospective students.
The boyish and bony D. J. Qualls will emerge as an unlikely favorite of
audiences because his character Kyle is irresistibly sweet and is also the only
character that is developed during the course of the movie.  The actor who
plays the hero, Breckin Meyer, who previously appeared in "Clueless" and "Go,"
brings little to the party.  Josh is a bland rendition of "typical college
guy."  He has surprisingly little emotional involvement in the love triangle at
the center of the plot; he seems to be with Tiffany out of habit and with Beth
for purely physical reasons.  
Bottom line:  Lots of laughs if you if you don't need frills like a plot or
character development.

DreamWorks' first foray into tasteless teen territory is a bawdy blend
of American Pie's horny adolescence (minus the pastry porking) and
There's Something About Mary's affinity toward semen-as-a-sight-gag.
And in terms of overall entertainment, Road Trip ranks somewhere between
its two predecessors  a rare film that is consistently funny with the
majority of its jokes hitting the bulls-eye.
Trip is largely told via flashback by Barry (Tom Green, The Tom Green
Show), an eighth-year student at the fictitious University of Ithaca.
The tour guide for prospective students and their parents, Barry is
pressed for details about exciting stories of campus life and eventually
begins to tell the tale of one Josh Porter.
Josh (Breckin Meyer, Go) was, Barry explains, an IU student trying to
survive a long-distance relationship with his lifelong girlfriend
Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard, The Rage: Carrie 2), who is currently
attending veterinary school at the University of Austin.  Josh's
nightmares of Tiffany's potential infidelities, coupled with the fact
that she won't return his phone calls, leads the sophomore to a
one-night fling with a hot blonde named Beth (Amy Smart, Felicity).  A
videotape is made and accidentally mailed to Tiffany, who it turns out,
wasn't calling Josh back because of a death in the family.
Still wanting to maintain a romantic relationship with Tiffany, Josh
decides to hit the road to intercept the tape before his girlfriend gets
it.  His friends E.L. (Seann William Scott, Final Destination) and Rubin
(Paulo Costanzo, in his film debut) con Kyle (DJ Qualls, in his film
debut), a nerdy compulsive masturbator with a credit card and a sky-blue
Ford Taurus, to provide the wheels for the road trip to Austin.
The trip, of course, is full of wacky teen hijinks, like stealing from
the blind, Evil Knievel-style jumps over washed-out bridges and, what is
sure to be the equivalent of Pie's pie scene, sperm donation.  There are
two subplots, one involving Beth's ill-advised journey to Boston (and
not Austin) to find Tiffany, and the other entails a jealous teacher's
aide (Anthony Rapp, Man of the Century) hell-bent on making Josh miss
his Ancient Philosophy midterm.
Oh, and here are some major plot holes  Beth knows Tiffany's last name
from seeing it on the videotape's envelope, but doesn't remember that
she doesn't go to school in Boston.  And for some reason, Josh needs to
pull a B-plus on his midterm to pass the class.  I guess the final exam
doesn't count.  Despite it being midterm in upstate New York, there is
no snow on the ground.
While some people will insist that Trip could be American Pie 2: The
College Years, the film smacks more of a 1998 straight-to-video picture
called Overnight Delivery (the only reason I know about Delivery is
because Dogma's Kevin Smith was supposed to have done an un-credited
rewrite of the script).  Save the presence of the Josh and Beth's
videotape, it's exactly the same film  very light on script, but full
of gags.
Filmed in Georgia, using four different college campuses, Trip was
directed, composed and co-written by Todd Phillips, who is probably best
known for Frat House, a documentary that won the top prize at the 1998
Sundance Film Festival and was purchased by HBO but never shown on
television amid allegations that the antics of the fraternity members 
especially regarding brutal pledge hazing  were all staged.  Trip was
executive-produced by Ivan Reitman and features great cameos by Andy
Dick (Inspector Gadget), Horatio Sands (Saturday Night Live) and a very
funny voice-over by The Man Show's Jimmy Kimmel.
1:35 - R for strong sexual content, crude humor, language and drug use

         This is a silly, sophomoric sex comedy - and, if that's what
you're in the mood for, line up at the popcorn counter. But it's not
as good as "American Pie" or "There's Something About Mary." And it's
not as funny as "National Lampoon's Animal House" or "Porky's."
Breckin Meyer stars as Josh, who's been in love with Tiffany (Rachel
Blanchard) since they were kids. He's committed to her - except for a
college fling with sexually aggressive Beth (Amy Smart). But his
infidelity was recorded on videotape - and that tape has been
accidentally mailed to Tiffany. Which necessitates a spontaneous,
desperate three-day, 1,800-mile road trip from Ithaca, New York, to
Austin, Texas, to intercept the incriminating sexcapade and save his
romance. He's accompanied by his bumbling best-friend, played by Seann
William Scott, plus pot-smoking Paulo Costanzo and the requisite
nerdy-guy-with-the-car, DK Qualls. So much for plot. MTV comedian Tom
Green serves as the cryptic narrator/tour guide named Barry
Manilow. (That moniker is typical of the lame humor.)
Co-writer/director Todd Phillips wallows in the gross, crude antics as
the four guys in a Taurus experience all the gratuitous nudity
(a.k.a. bare breasts) their testosterone levels can conjure
up. Unfortunately, none of this is very original if you've ever seen a
dumb teenage sex comedy before. It's 91 minutes long - which only
seems like three hours. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Road
Trip" is a trashy, raunchy 3, determined to offend as many people as
possible.

For whatever reason, the genre of the raunchy sex comedy disappeared in
the late 80s.  It was revitalized in the mid-90s thanks mainly to the
efforts of the Farrelly brothers and their films Dumb and Dumber,
Kingpin, and most importantly There's Something About Mary.  Last year,
American Pie solidified the new success of the genre.  Now comes Road
Trip, and its impending success should keep the genre going well into
the future (for better or for worse).  It's certainly better than
American Pie in every way imaginable. 
Not only is Road Trip the current "bearer of the torch" for the raunchy
sex comedy genre, but it's also the breakout movie for MTV personality
Tom Green.  I'm not a fan of Green's antics on his show, but here he
proves he can be funny when he's under the restraints of a script.  I'm
usually against any kind of creative restrainment, but in Green's case
it's a good idea.  It prevents him from making screeching noises for 90
minutes straight... as he's known to do. 
Green plays Barry, the film's storyteller.  He relates the events of the
film involving him and a group of his friends to a tour group he's
leading at Ithica University.  The story that Barry tells us is this...
Josh Porter (Breckin Meyer) cheats on his lifelong girlfriend (who
attends a college halfway across the country from Josh) when he believes
that she has done the same, and he accidentally mails her a video tape
of the incident.  When he learns that his assumptions were incorrect, he
(and three of his friends, for no real reason except to give the movie
more characters) set out to intercept the package before his girlfriend
receives it. 
Now I know it's hard to argue logic with movies like this, but I do
wonder why Green seems much smarter as he's telling the story than he is
IN the story.  If you were telling a story, wouldn't you make yourself
look good?  He does take some liberties, giving a few details "his
way"... but you'd think he'd make himself look better than he comes off. 
Logic argument #2: Meyer gleefully cheats on his girlfriend because he
believes she's done the same.  When he finds out that the sex tape has
been mailed to her, he freaks out.  Now he shouldn't really care at this
point because his whole point of cheating on her was to get back at
her.  When he finds out that she was actually at her grandfather's
funeral and that she hadn't cheated on him, THAT'S when he should have
started to be upset.  It would have been funnier to have him not care
about the tape being mailed and THEN find out he was wrong. 
An unfortunate aspect of Road Trip is its rampant similarity to another
recent comedy, the little seen 1998 film Overnight Delivery starring
Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon.  In Overnight Delivery, Rudd and his
longtime sweetheart (Christine Taylor) attend separate colleges.  When
Rudd's character thinks that his girlfriend has cheated on him, he and
stripper Witherspoon take risqué pictures of themselves and mail them to
her, only to find out after the package was mailed that his assumptions
were wrong.  The two sent out on a cross country trek to recover the
pictures before the girlfriend gets them.  Sound similar?  
Both the situations in Overnight Delivery and Road Trip are also
initiated by the bitchy roommates of each girlfriend, and both have the
same resolution.  Now I'm not saying that Road Trip stole its story from
Overnight Delivery just because Overnight Delivery came out first,
because who knows what was written first?  Yes, the two stories are
incredibly similar, more so than they should be actually.  But it was a
major distraction to see a movie I had basically already seen before
(and much better actually). 
Most of the "big" jokes in Road Trip miss big time (the goofballs in the
screening roared at almost everything in the film though, even the
scenes that were in the film's trailer).  And speaking of trailers, add
Road Trip to the list of trailers that features scenes that aren't in
the movie itself (and I'm not referring to the scenes with Tom Green
that were shot specifically for the trailer). 
Anyway, the smaller moments worked very well, and clearly sailed right
over the heads of the aforementioned goofballs.  Lots of witty dialogue
and just the sheer energy of the cast make this movie worthwhile.  A
small, hilarious role by Andy Dick ("NewsRadio") is almost worth the
price of admission alone. 
The success of Road Trip will undoubtedly encourage even more entries in
the genre.  And as long as they include the same types of entertaining
little moments for me mixed in with the raunchiness to please the
masses, everyone should be happy.

Sex has become so mainstream in its explicitness that it has lost all its
mystery. 1999's "American Pie" proved that sex sells, particularly in teen sex
comedies. Today's teenagers need not worry about school or their prospective
futures. All they apparently think about is sex, and nothing else. Dating is a
thing of the past, just get down and dirty on the first date and worry about
relationships later (there was the phenomenon of date rape, still a possibility
but now it is mulled over in favor of getting down and dirty). "Road Trip" is
simply a sex comedy, and the emphasis is clearly sexual with comedic overtones.
Breckin Meyer, who has played his share of stoners, is the sweet, clean-cut guy
named Josh this time. Gasp! He now attends a university in Ithaca where he is
failing a course that could get him in serious academic trouble. But a passing
grade is the least of his worries - he is too wrapped in a long-distance
relationship. His childhood sweetheart is attending the University of Austin and
Josh misses her greatly. What is Josh going to do, and how can he prevent
himself from meeting other sexy chicks, including the luscious Beth (Amy Smart)?
Needless to say, Josh and Beth end up between the sheets and record the event
with a trusty camcorder (You know it is the 21st century when all private
activities are recorded with a camcorder).  Josh is no longer sullen and
inhibited, though the taped event is now lost! Apparently, one of his buddies
mailed the wrong tape to Josh's girlfriend (initially, Josh just recorded a
taped message to her). Josh enlists the help of his buddies to go on a road trip
to Austin to prevent Tiffany from receiving the tape. Josh's buddies include
Kyle (DJ Qualls), a nerd who masturbates endlessly, Rubin (Paulo Costanzo), an
intellectual pot-smoker and E.L. (Seann William Scott), the pseudo-cool guy who
doesn't like the concept of learning. Together they endure one mishap after
another, including car explosions, hot babes, blind women, irate pistol-packing
fathers, an African-American fraternity, and more hot babes. 
"Road Trip" starts with the time-honored tradition of the road picture though we
barely get much of a glimpse of America - an 1,800 mile trip from Ithaca, New
York to Austin, Texas must have some locations of interest. No matter, this
movie is all about sex, sex and more sex - oh, and there is a package to
intercept. What we merely get in "Road Trip" is a host of comic situations. At
the sorority, Kyle gets his chance for a real romp in the hay with a sensual
BBW. E.L. and Josh go to a sperm clinic where E.L. receives unlikely
professional help. Rubin merely smokes weed and thinks too much to worry about
sex. Meanwhile, the buddy who decided to stay in Ithaca, Barry (Tom Green), an
eight-year resident of the university, spends his time trying to get a mouse
eaten by a snake. Considering Green's shenanigans of late, this whole subplot
should come as no surprise. 
"Road Trip" is fitfully funny and at times, surprisingly sweet-tempered. I like
the idea that the film does not aim for the gross-out gags of "American Pie" or
other teen flicks. Director Todd Phillips ("Hated: The G.G. Allin Story")
decides to cut back from the gross level, playing it safer than usual. This
results in numerous gags that often work, and some that are recycled from
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (the car bit is an obvious lift). The blind woman
scene works because she sees more than she lets on when confronted by E.L. The
restaurant scene is a let-down but some gags and situational humor work in spite
of themselves. I was surprised how much I laughed during the film, particularly
at Tom Green who serves as the film's narrator (his university tour guide scenes
are hilarious). The actors are all appealing and fun personalities to watch and
the humor never sinks lower than a toilet bowl. But I must ask again as I did
when I saw "American Pie" - do freshman college students have anything else on
their minds besides sex? Apparently not.
Footnote: The video camcorder incident is in question over authenticity. There
is a scene where Beth tapes an interview with Josh before getting hot and heavy
with him while the camera records the whole event. The camcorder used is a
digital Sony DV camera. In order to record anything, the camera must have a
mini-DV tape in it, otherwise recording is impossible (as with all camcorders).
It is clear that the DV camera is recording because the red light indicator is
on. Therefore, a mini-DV tape must be in the camera. Later on, Josh reluctantly
shows his buddies the taped event. Only the tape is now full-size, 1/2 inch VHS
tape. This can only mean that Josh either simultaneously recorded the event on
DV and VHS or dubbed the mini-DV tape to VHS. No actual scene shows this, and it
is also clear that Beth set the recording on for the camcorder only (despite it
being viewed on Josh's TV monitor). Since he shows his buddies the wrong tape,
one can assume that  the DV tape was mailed to Tiffany. Since a later scene
shows Tiffany viewing a VHS tape, then it is clear the filmmakers are unaware of
how DV cameras work, or Josh taped his interview on DV and then transferred it
to VHS so Tiffany could view it on her TV. Either way, a transitional scene is
missing. Oh, the details we video nuts must worry about.

Road Trip

Starring Tom Green, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart
Paulo Costanzo, Seann William Scott, DJ Qualls, Rachel Blanchard
Screenplay by Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong
Directed by Todd Phillips

>From the time they were five, Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany (Rachel
Blanchard) swore undying love. Then college came and they were separated
by 1800 long and lonely miles, he in New York, she in Texas, and one
burning hot telephone line. One day, Tiffany stopped returning calls
and, having aggravated her roommate to death, Josh is told that she
didn't come home the night before. Crushed, Josh falls into the arms of
the very hot for him Beth (Amy Smart) -- actually, he buys her for
twenty six dollars, but that's a whole 'nother story -- and being the
90s kind of guy that he is, gets the entire sordid encounter on
videotape. Beth's idea, for that matter.
It wasn't Josh's idea to send the tape to Tiffany, but that's what
happens and that's what kicks Road Trip into motion. Sure, it's one
boner joke after another with a couple of doobie gags, fat jokes and toe
sucking tossed in to break the monotony of nubile young ladies parading
about starkers on the big screen . . .
Yep, another teenflick. Not as politically incorrect as a Farrelly
Brothers flick. Not as flat out below the belt disgustingly funny as
American Pie, Road Trip nonetheless is consistently funny -- moreso if
you've never seen anything like it before. I have, God knows over the
last twenty years I've seen more than my share, but I can honestly
report that there was a consistent grin plastered to my face. Road Trip
didn't crack the cranky crust as American Pie did, but it was not
unamusing to this fossil.
The story is narrated by campus tour guide Barry (Tom Green), who's made
a full time career out of college life (he's eight years in to his four
year undergrad program). While leading a campus tour, Barry spins his
tale of sex, sex, dope, a snake and a mouse, to the disbelieving ears of
the freshmen to be and their folks. Quite honestly, there's nothing more
to tell you about the story without giving the jokes away. What I will
say is that everything you may have thought about what Tom Green does to
the mouse (as hinted in the previews and teevee spots) is nothing
compared to how sick his character is. It's the one performance that
kept Road Trip interesting for this old fart of a reviewer.
Well, that and Rachel Blanchard with red hair. Someone stuff me in a
freezer until she's my age . . .
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Road Trip, he would have paid...
'cuz the youth are gonna go and they're gonna take dates. If I was still
tokin' Road Trip would be a rental.

         Oh, to be able to go back to those happy, carefree days of
student life, when responsibilities could be easily shrugged off,
friends were loyal, dinner consisted of leftover pizza and ramen noodles
and studies could be easily brushed aside in favor of attending a beer
bash.
 What? That wasn't your college experience?
 Then you obviously didn't attend the University of Ithaca, the
alma mater of the gang in "Road Trip," a relentlessly tacky cruise into
the depths of cheap jokes and shock humor. Pasted together from scraps
of "There's Something About Mary," "The Sure Thing" and approximately 70
other teen-oriented comedies, the movie is a prime example of what can
result from filmmakers pandering to the lowest common denominator. It's
also pretty funny in its own right, although few people over the age of
21 are going to be courageous enough to admit they laughed at it.
 Leading us on this perversion excursion is Barry (Tom Green),
an overripe undergraduate who's currently in his eighth year at Ithaca
and who conducts orientation sessions guaranteed to scare the living
daylights out of prospective attendees. Pointing out the psychology
building, he tells incoming freshmen "each semester, you'll be expected
to volunteer for cutting-edge experiments."
 Barry also has a story to tell, a real whopper about his buddy
Josh (Breckin Meyer), who accidentally videotaped the one night he was
unfaithful to Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his girlfriend of three years.
Since she lives 1800 miles away in Austin, that wouldn't seem to be a
major crisis -- except that Josh's roommates accidentally mailed the
tape to her, thinking it was something else.
 Now Josh, geeky Kyle (DJ Qualls), stoner Rubin (Paulo Costanzo)
and the happily amoral E.L. (Seann William Scott, destined to be forever
remembered as the "pale ale" guy from "American Pie") -- who theorizes
you're not really cheating if you and your true love are in different
area codes -- must scurry down to Texas to retrieve the cassette before
Tiffany gets ahold of it. Josh insists they must make it there in three
days, although given the speed of the U.S. mail these days, you'd think
they'd be able to take the scenic route and still make it with plenty of
time to spare. Following not so close on their heels is Josh's
one-night-stand Beth (Amy Smart), who was misled by Barry into thinking
the boys went to Boston instead of Austin and who winds up accidentally
causing some major mayhem of her own.
 The screenplay by Scot Armstrong and director Todd Phillips
keeps beating you over the head with raunchiness until you're left with
only two choices: either walk out, or succumb. If you stick around,
you'll witness a gross-out farce that should make any cretin chuckle, a
veritable barrage of potshots at overweight lovers, blind people,
clueless sorority sisters, African-American fraternity brothers,
unctuous teaching assistants, snarky motel desk clerks, smarmy
restaurant workers, innocent white mice and drug-addled senior citizens.
A Best Picture nomination next spring seems somehow unlikely.
 And yet "Road Trip" passes the test of a really good comedy: It
seems even funnier when you're telling your friends about it days later
than it did when you were watching it. Some critics have called this
phenomenon "depth-charge humor." If that's the case, then "Road Trip" is
a blast. James Sanford

In some of my recent reviews I have talked about the expected audiences for
movies. If examples like this would happen more often, I would easily be able
to write an essay on the subject, my thesis would be that the movie is the
audience. Likewise, the audience is the movie. During the press screening of
Road Trip that I attended, a local radio station had also given away several
tickets to that show. DJs from the station proceeded to throw everything from
gum, Frisbees, Cds, posters, keychains, and yes, even condoms at us from the
front and the back of the theater, before and after the movie. This gave me a
strong impression of the movie before it even began. The sexually charged film
is a masterpiece for its frat boy audience. The audience indeed laughed their
heads off. I admit that most of the time I was laughing along with them. The
talking dog, the grandpa who uses Viagra, and the talking penis. All at the
time were very funny. However, Road Trip is one of those comedies that, in
retrospect, you can't think of why you laughed it at all. It does a great job
of keeping us interested in the rebellious actions and anarchism happening on
screen; but just hours later, all I had left was an empty feeling. Maybe it's
because it isn't really summer yet. Perhaps I'm still expecting some artistic
value in a movie. However, it could be that the characters are just as hollow
as my feeling of the movie was.
Josh Porter (Meyer, who starred in the excellent teen movie Dancer, Texas Pop.
81) is in a long distance relationship with Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard). He goes
to Ithaca in New York and she does to the University of Austin. One night, Josh
has sex with Beth (Amy Smart) who insists on filming themselves while they make
love. Somehow, the tape of the two's rendezvous gets mailed to Tiffany, so Josh
and three of his buddies must drive to Austin and intercept the tape before it
reaches Tiffanyâs eyes. This is a setup for the usual R-rated teenage movie
fodder that includes the essential elements like drug use, explosions, and
virginity shattering sex. Each of the four main characters is supposedly
different, we get traits to associate them with, but they are really just the
same horny college guy. Thus, we get left with the female characters to watch.
One of which is an idiot (Tiffany), while the other (Beth), begins to doubt her
expectations of a relationship from her night of sexual passion. On a bus, she
asks the woman next to her if there is any hope for a solid relationship in the
world. Yes, the woman replies. She also adds that it comes with batteries. 
With so many indistinguishable characters, where does the film find it's real
comedy? The answer is also the casting director's greatest triumph; the triumph
is Tom Green. Green, who has become well known as the gross-out king on his
show that currently airs on MTV, breathes some much needed life into this
movie. He does not participate in the road trip, but does have some fun with a
friend's snake whom he tries, unsuccessfully, to force feed a mouse. He tells
the snake to, "Unleash the fury" with no avail and his unpredictable and
annoying actions (the reasons I never watch his show) are right at home in this
movie. Seann William Scott (who also starred in the similarly themed, but far
superior American Pie) proves once again (as if Final Destination wasn't
enough) that there isn't a good acting bone in his body. Meyer and Smart have
both been in better movies, and the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. The
thing I found most disappointing about Road Trip though, was its conclusion.
There wasn't really a climax to any of the events of the previous 85 minutes.
The only climaxes occurring in this movie came from the genitalia of the
characters. At least five different femaleâs breasts and a scene of brief
full frontal nudity later, I could tell the film succeeded with its intended
crowd. The shopping complex I attended the screening at was closed that evening
because they were hosting the after movie party for the opening night of the
Seattle International Film Festival. Something interesting happened while I was
paying for parking. A young couple, both wearing a wardrobe consisting of
entirely genuine, all black leather, were talking about the artistic meaning of
the movie they just attended in front of me. In the line next to me, a fortyish
man with a large beer gut was partying with teenagers half his age as they
passed around the condoms, Road Trip posters, and radio station bumper stickers
distributed earlier. I was in no way drawn to this movie, but as I looked at
the couple in front of me again, and then back to the adolescents, I couldn't
help but smile.

The question that you must ask yourself before stepping into the theatre to
see this movie is, "what do I really want to get out of this film?". If the
answer to that question is that you want to encounter well-rounded
characters involved in an intriguing plot about the trials and tribulations
of college life, well...chances are, this film ain't exactly what you're
looking for. If, on the other hand, you're looking for sex jokes, fart
jokes, people making fun of one another, titties flashing around here and
there, and Tom Green actually putting a live mouse into his mouth...chunk
down the change and get ready to laugh your big ass off! This movie is funny
shite!
PLOT:
Some dude in college accidentally mails a videotape of himself dicking
another girl to his girlfriend in Texas. Upon this realization, the boy
heads out on a road trip, with buddies in tow, in order to retrieve the tape
before his long-life girlfriend does.
CRITIQUE:
Many funny moments, many gross moments, many flashes of breasts and sexual
situations, and many a good tune qualify this movie as the first big comedy
hit of the summer. I think it's been said in other places before, but allow
me to re-iterate the obvious. If you liked AMERICAN PIE last summer, and if
you laughed at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY the summer previous, this film
is more than likely to churn your humorous butter. The characters are having
a lot of fun, the movie is poking a lot of fun, and by golly, we as an
audience, are supposed to take it all as "fun", and not much else. And
unlike other "safer" teen flicks of yesteryear, this movie doesn't hide
behind the forbidden glass door either. It shows these folks having sex,
cheating on their mates, smoking the good weed, drinking the good drink, and
ultimately just living the high life of their college years. And my-oh-my,
whose idea was it to put T&A back into "teen" flicks? Whoever it was, allow
me to shake your hand, cause a fan I was not of those "pretend" movies which
brought everyone to the brink of the sexual situations, only to pull the rug
right out from under us at the last possible moment.
Giving the ladies a bit of the Tom Green ass was also a good idea. Spread
the perversion, Hollywood, women want to see some of that, too! Speaking of
Green, that was the one thing which did kind of disappoint me about this
movie. NOT that he wasn't funny, no-no, not at all. In fact, he was one of
the funnier characters in the film, only that he's barely in the 95-minute
hummer! You see, he doesn't actually join his friends on the road trip, so
we only get to see him from time to time, which was sort of disappointing,
since he really does have a huge presence. All this to say that if you're
looking for a very funny, mindless, sexist and most likely every other -ist
type of film, this one is sure to fit your bill. It's funny as heck, it's
got a great, hip soundtrack and it moves along at a quickity-quick pace. So
wipe that smile onto your face, wash your balls, get your mind into the
gutter, and prepare to enjoy watching a bunch of goofballs getting into all
kinds of trouble. And oh yeah...there's also a moral to the story...if
you're gonna cheat on your partner...try not to send them the actual
videotape of the event!
PS: Any movie that includes Twisted Sister's classic anthem "I Wanna Rock",
is allright in my book.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actor Seann William Scott played a similar role in last year's AMERICAN PIE,
and also had a decent part in the underrated thriller from earlier this
year, FINAL DESTINATION. He was also featured in Aerosmith's "A Hole in My
Soul" video, and set out on a 1-month road trip of his own to Australia,
after completing this picture.
And who can forget Breckin Meyer's performance in last year's awesome GO, as
the character of Tiny. And if you don't remember him in that flick, you may
remember his Spicolli-esque skateboarder performance in 1995's CLUELESS, or
his days on the TV show "Wonder Years", his first big break. His first movie
role was in 1991's FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.
DJ Qualls got the part of Kyle after auditioning for a one-line part at the
film's Atlanta casting office (where most of this film was shot). The
director invited him to meet executive producer Ivan Reitman, and poof...he
was cast! In addition to his professional accomplishments, DJ is also a
cancer survivor, and an advocate for cancer research and awareness.
This film marks director Todd Phillips' first major studio release. He
previously directed the smaller films HATED and the controversial FRAT
HOUSE.
Actress Amy Smart shows her boobies in this movie.

** (out of 4) ROAD TRIP is a bad college comedy with just a handful of
laughs. It will never be a GOOD movie, and it will only be a FUNNY movie
if you sit in a theater with a big crowd of college students.
In a bracketing story, Tom Green (of MTV fame), playing 7th-year
undergrad Barry, is giving a tour of Ithaca college. He tells his
audience would-be students and their parents about a legendary love in
one particular dormitory....
Josh and Tiffany (Breckin Meyer and Rachel Blanchard), have been
sweethearts since childhood, and they still keep in touch, even though
Josh is at Ithaca and Tiffany studies in Austin.
One lonely night Josh sleeps with another girl, and he videotapes his
tryst for the extra excitement. There is a mix-up, and the incriminating
tape is accidentally sent to Tiffany. With the tape on its way, the only
thing for Josh to do is to drive to Austin and try to beat the U.S.
Mail.
Josh gets three of his friends to go with him. E.L. (Seann William
Scott) is the party animal who can get his friends to agree to anything.
Ruben (Paulo Costanzo) is the guy who fills his brain with philosophy,
trivia, and any drug that might be interesting. Kyle (DJ Qualls) is the
token scrawny nerd who gets to come along because he has access to a
car.
The situation is perfect for a college comedy, but ROAD TRIP doesn't
have enough laughs to capitalize.
For one thing, the jokes were not fast-paced enough. Instead of
exhausting me with joke after joke, like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,
ROAD TRIP made me wait for every joke, and I dutifully anticipated each
one. During the pauses between jokes I found myself getting ready for
the next moment of comic release.
My audience seemed to feel the same way, like they were primed to laugh,
like they were waiting for the slightest comic trigger. Once we were so
eager to laugh that when the woman next to me blew her nose it got a
polite wave of chuckles.
Another part of the problem lies somewhere between the writers and the
actors. Either Phillips (who also wrote the screenplay) can't write
college dialogue, or the actors didn't know how to work with the
material. In any case, many of the jokes felt forced. E.L. agrees to the
trip by saying "you expect me to stay here and learn?" He sounds more
like someone's vague idea of a college student than an actual student. 
There are a few reasons to recommend ROAD TRIP. The camaraderie of the
four main characters was genuine and eventually interesting. Green's
comic interludes were sick and amusing. Some of the jokes were
unexpected, and therefore quite funny.

"Road Trip," a tale about four underachieving college
students who embark on a hastily planned journey, is a
4-lane highway of laughter and is one of the funniest
movies in recent memory.  Convince your friend to
drive you, steal a bus from a school for the blind, or
walk through the backwoods as fast as you can. 
Whatever mode of transportation you choose, make your
final destination this hilarious new comedy.  
The tone is effectively set up within the first five
minutes of the film as we join up with Barry (Tom
Green), a career Senior at Ithaca University, who is
in the midst of giving a tour to a group of
prospective incoming freshman.  Barry is a bag of
mixed emotions composed of 3 parts lethargy and 1 part
morbid curiosity.  During the tour, he rambles about
Ithaca's history and points out, for example, that its
library was built in the 1600s.  A flustered tour
participant points to an ornamental plaque by the
library's entrance and retorts that the building was
actually built in 1951.  "No," he says after some
self-deliberation.  "That's the address."
As part of the tour, he relays the story of
long-distance couple Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany
(Rachel Blanchard).   He attends Ithaca while she
attends a university in Austin ("That's in
Massachusetts," says the likable but dimwitted Barry).
Josh worries about the pact that they made to stay
close.  To show his commitment, he prepares a
videotaped message professing his undying love.  His
sexually adventurous friend, E.L. (Sean William Scott)
tries to explain to him that holding out for a
long-distance love could be the greatest folly of his
life.  He imparts, "the window of opportunity to
drink, do drugs and get with girls is getting smaller
with each passing day.  Before you know it, you'll be
40 and you'll have to pay for these kinds of girls."
Josh is unfazed, but after a wild party hosted by
E.L., he winds up with college hottie Beth (Amy Smart)
and subsequently videotapes his act of infidelity. 
Guess which videotape gets mistakenly sent to
girlfriend Beth?  Aghast, Josh has only a matter of
days to travel to Austin to intercept the tape and
then to get back in order to take a critical final
test.  In a matter of days, he could lose his
girlfriend AND get expelled from school.
E.L. exuberantly yells, "all right, road trip!"  Along
for the ride is levelheaded, pot smoking Rubin(Paulo
Costanzo) and the meek and thin-as-a-pin Kyle (DJ
Qualls) who is invited because he's the only one with
a car and a credit card.  Without giving notice, the
four hurriedly leave.  This infuriates Beth who,
thanks to Barry's command of American geography,
boards a bus to the University of Massachusetts to
find Josh.  Barry, meanwhile, uses their absence to
fulfill his dream of feeding Rubin's pet boa
constrictor.  And Kyle's ill-tempered father (Fred
Ward), who could easily make the National Rifle
Association jittery, thinks that his son has been
kidnapped.  Meanwhile, the four Austin-bound students
experience their own share of setbacks and bizarre
encounters.  In its funniest segment, the group tries
to pass themselves off as brothers of an all-black
fraternity.  A great road trip isn't about where you
wind up, but what happens on the way there.  These
guys will experience the trip of their lives.
"Road Trip" is this summer's most refreshing
alternative.  But it will appeal most to the under 35
crowd.  It's a crisp, straightforward comedy.  It's
not ribald (i.e. "There's Something About Mary") nor
is it a lampoon ("Naked Gun").  It's more like
'guerilla comedy' where the jokes just seem to come
out of nowhere and then latch onto you until you
laugh.  The humor is relentless, the pace is lively,
and you'll come out of it grinning from ear to ear.

Nope. Not Tom Greeny. Just greeny. Some people hate this guy, some people
love this guy. I happen to think he's pretty funny, but I don't like him.
However, none of this will effect how much you enjoy "Road Trip" because Tom
Green plays a minor role in the production.
And ninety percent of his role is not Tom Green material. Okay, there's the
rat in mouth trick - pretty darned funny, I laughed; and the kissing some
kid's mom on the lips part - funny, I'm not denying it. But all else is
scripted work that could have been done by any other actor - quite likely
better. Tom is best in an unscripted, unprompted environment. That doesn't
happen here, but it doesn't matter, because this film is not about Tom
Green. (Think I've made that point.)
It's about Josh (Breckin Meyer), he's had the same girlfriend/buddy since
first grade, but now that they've gone to separate colleges, he has reason
to believe she's cheating on him. So he does what any true friend would do,
he sleeps with a convenient babe, videos it and accidentally mails the tape
to his girl in Austin, Texas. Realizing his "I Love Lucy" blunder, he
gathers his friends and begs, burrows, steals his way to Texas to intercept
that package.
Okay, it's not the meatiest of plot lines - but I wasn't expecting one
anyway. I was expecting Tom Green, and/or comedy, both of which were absent,
tardy, or simply not paying attention.
The funniest scene finds Grampa in his pajamas with a Viagra-induced woody.
He's completely unembarrassed to greet the four college guests with his lil'
pal poppin' the tent, "What do you want me to do, cut it off?" It's very
funny actually.
Most of the acting is fine, but Seann William Scott's Jim-Carrey-wannabee
act is a bit grating. That and the fake bomb threat. I don't find that
humorous.
I've heard this film compared to "American Pie" ... sacrilege! In truth, you
could count the gut-busting scenes on one hand, and the chucklers on the
other and still have a finger or two left to do with as you please. (Don't
tell me I don't want to know).

Another Gen-X sexy summer comedy about obnoxious boys and the slightly 
smarter girls who try to tame
them. The story revolves around four college dudes from Ithaca University who 
must travel to Austin,
Texas in order to save one of the dudes' love life. 
The title says it all so there's not much need to list the funny, wacky and 
just plain insane pratfalls our
heroes will likely endure given the circumstances. This is a college movie so 
you can take a guess as to what
kind of humor is going on here. Does it work? Yes... if you're not easily 
offended! But it's unfortunate the
screenplay doesn't have much going for besides the jokes which makes the film 
one-dimensional. It's your
call.

   If you think the most exciting thing that could come out of a
trip to Austin is your meeting Gov. Bush or even (wow!)
shaking hands with Harry Knowles, you may be the victim of
a limited imagination.  You're not likely to have the time of
your life like the fellas and gals in Todd Phillips's "Road Trip,"
a frequently rollicking but always smile-on-your-face sitcom
which for better or worse does not out-vulgar "American Pie"
as a (so to speak) coming of age comedy.  But the one-liners
are so spot-on and the characters so lively and refreshing in
their individual eccentricities that "Road Trip" is a journey
you'll want to make.
   Co-written by Scot Armstrong, "Road Trip" is scripted and
directed by NYU Film School graduate Todd Phillips ("Frat
House") who takes a cameo for himself in this, his first major
studio release.  His actors include Brecklin Meyer as the all-
American type, Josh; Seann William Scott as Josh's best
friend E.L.; Amy Smart as Josh's new love interest, Beth, and
D.J. Qualls as the nerd of the group, Kyle.  Now, Austin may
not be the most fascinating destination in America but as they
say, the journey and not the goal is what traveling is all
about. Even then, you're as likely to win the lottery as meet
up with the idiosyncratic cross-section of America that these
guys do.
   The trip is hosted by a narrator, Barry (MTV's Tom Green),
who frames the film as a story he relates to a group of
parents and future students of Ithaca University in New York--
whom he is escorting around the campus.  As the tour bogs
down in boredom (particularly since Barry, who is in his
eighth year at the college, doesn't know much about the
buildings he's showing off), Barry relates the story of a trip
made by a group of his fellow collegians some time back in
which he played a back-home role.
   The story goes something like this.  When Josh, who has
been the boy friend of Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since they
were five, has a fling for the first time with another student at
Ithaca, Beth, he filmed his one-night stand on his video
camera.  By accident, the tape was mailed to Josh's girl
friend, now a student at the University of Austin.  Josh and
three of his pals hit the road to head off the package before it
can get into Tiffany's hands.  Along the way they meet with
some of the goofy oddballs that make America such a great
land of diversity--bizarre people and outlandish situations that
constitute the basis for the comedy.  Their escapades include
conning a blind woman at a school for the sightless into
lending them a bus, pretending to be brothers a national
fraternity which turns out to have an all-black membership,
and raising money by making donations at a sperm back. 
Each of these situations, and many more, are successfully
milked for comedy in Phillips and Armstrong's script--which
makes obvious allowances for some ad-libbing by this
talented group of young people playing at enjoying the best
years of their lives.
   Watch especially for a cameo by Corky the talking dog, for
what is (to me) a most original way to contribute to a sperm
bank, and for a waiter's innovative method to remove
unwanted sugar from the surface of a plate of French Toast. 
The performers are likeable to a fault, especially Tom Green
as the guy who may not be able to pass his courses but he
sure can tell tall tales, enough to persuade everyone on the
tour to look forward to matriculating at Ithaca.  "Road Trip" is
about the college you wish you attended.

     Having passed the year for which the designation "sophomoric" is
named in the mid-1980s, my perspective on a film like ROAD TRIP is bound
to be skewed. It is part of a grand tradition of leering, sniggering
comedies in which the anti-social behavior and hormone-fueled idiocy of
18-year-olds (portrayed by 25-year-olds) are celebrated for the
entertainment of 15-year-olds. But I remember a time when such tales were
sublimely crude (ANIMAL HOUSE) rather than ridiculously crude (AMERICAN
PIE), when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing
how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an R-rated film. Pushing
the envelope, Farrelly brothers-style, can be fun; stuffing the envelope
to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a
simple, wearying exercise in "can we get away with this?"
     If you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing
when it's accompanied by a groan of disgust, have we got a treat for
you. ROAD TRIP is framed as a tale of infamy told by a campus tour guide
named Barry (Tom Green) at the fictional University of Ithaca. He tells of
Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer), an earnest enough fellow in a long-distance
relationship with a childhood sweetheart attending college in Austin,
Texas. When Josh hooks up one night with Beth (Amy Smart) and videotapes
their tryst, he thinks it's a momentary lapse ... until he discovers that
one of his roommates has mailed the tape to his girlfriend Tiffany. Soon
Josh and three pals -- libertine E.L. (Seann William Scott), brilliant
Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) and geeky Kyle (DJ Qualls) -- are on the road for
Austin, racing the clock to get to the tape before Tiffany returns to
school from a family funeral.
     I believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few
detours before reaching Texas. Most of those detours involve the Sacred
Duo of Collegiate Intemperance: mood-altering substances and sex. There's
a stop to make deposits at a sperm bank when they run out of money.
There's a stop at a college where they end up partying with members of a
black fraternity, and where Kyle loses his virginity to a corpulent
woman. And there's an overnight stay with an elderly couple where the
grizzled man of the house gets stoned and hallucinates a conversation with
his dog. It's a regular cornucopia of crudeness, choreographed by director
Todd Phillips with all the voyeuristic vigor he demonstrated when
choreographing (allegedly) the outrageous antics in the staged (allegedly) 
"documentary" FRAT HOUSE.
     Only it's just not all that funny. Unlike the pointlessly
message-mongering AMERICAN PIE, ROAD TRIP never pretends to be anything
more than a cesspool of moral depravity. It's even refreshing in a twisted
way that the girl who seduces Josh -- inspiring the cross-country recovery
mission in the first place -- actually becomes the film's heroine, daring
to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people. But
ROAD TRIP's singularity of purpose doesn't translate into much manic
energy. Its low-brow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities: 
the pairing of rail-thin Kyle with his substantial ladyfriend, an old man
sporting an obvious erection, the macho E.L. delighting in a prostate
massage. There's not much of a sense of comic discovery to ROAD TRIP's
gags; they're the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at.
     Deserved kudos do go to Tom Green, the MTV variety show
host-cum-circus geek who plays the demented Barry. Green's act can be
off-putting, but he's surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with
an unhealthy obsession with Rubin's pet python ("unleash the fury" has
already become part of my film-based lexicon). His scenes are some of the
only moments in ROAD TRIP where you can't be sure exactly what's going to
happen next. The rest of this trip meanders through some extremely
familiar countryside, and not familiar in a way that inspires fond
comparisons to classic genre cousins. ROAD TRIP is comedy a level removed
from anything that could be really funny, because it's all about how funny
the mere idea of a profane, stoned dog could be. As the real classics of
sophomoric humor have proved over the years, even when it comes to
gross-outs, execution is everything.

First off: I'm young. I'm 16 years old. Road Trip was
made for people my age and people my age will enjoy
it. If you're not a teenager, you probably won't like
this movie. There is a reason too - it wasn't made for
you to like it. Now on to the review. 
In my mind, raunchy films such as American Pie, the
recently released Road Trip, and (to some extent) the
"adult" comedy There's Something About Mary will
always be compared with the original gross-out comedy
classic National Lampoon's Animal House. One of the
few movies to literally take my breath away with
laughter, Animal House helped introduce a genre that
would sicken overprotective parents for decades to
come. After enjoying the excessive nudity, cursing,
prankster behavior, and all out college party
atmosphere that the 1978 trendsetter created, it
really was a shame that the 80's failed to aid in
continuing this dumb-fun style of filmmaking, just one
bomb after another. However, in the last three years
with the addition of Road Trip, the lewd comedy era
seems to be relishing a strong rebirth. First in 1998,
the Farrelly Brothers introduced Mary, a post college
tale filled with indecent behavior and penis jokes so
disgusting laughter was the only form of response that
made sense. In 1999, the Weitz Brothers' American Pie
told the story of a pre-college group and there
experiments in the field of sexual intercourse. Once
again, the offensively funny, crude style seemed
heavily borrowed from Animal House. Finally with Road
Trip in 2000, we get a movie much closer in both plot
and obscenity to my favorite comedy of the 20th
century. 
Road Trip seems like more of an homage than a rip off
of Animal House. Twenty years ago, it was very
difficult to get away with the smallest amount of
lasciviousness. I like to think of Road Trip as an
updated version of Animal House - this time with the
possibilities explored and utilized to their fullest
potential. At times, Road Trip does exactly what you
think it won't do; something so outrageous and
unexpected that it becomes shockingly hilarious. To
show how Road Trip goes step further than Animal
House: remember when Otter and the gang decades ago,
with all eyes watching them, uncomfortably sat in a
bar knowing they were the only white people in the
room? Well in Road Trip, the four main characters are
the only white guys in a fraternity house that they
crash at, but the scene doesn't end there - the frat
plays a prank on one of the boys by claiming they
found a Klan Mask in his duffel baguh oh. Would this
have happened in a movie twenty years ago? Probably
not. 
The story of Road Trip has little significance. It
merely serves as an excuse for pointless but humorous
jokes, one after the other. All you really need to
know to understand this movie is that a college
student accidentally sends a tape to his longtime
girlfriend that shows him having sex with another
girl. To prevent a disaster, the boy and three of his
friends must travel by car from their college in
Ithaca, New York to the University of Austin in three
days. A hilarious supplement to the film is a
character named Barry played by the insane Tom Green.
Much like the John Belushi character of Animal House
(except instead of crushing beer cans on his forehead,
puts live mice in his mouth), Barry has no real point
in the movie but to make you laugh at his unique
qualities. Doing gags very similar to the ones on his
self titled television show, fans should get a kick
out of him, while others may be a little confused at
his odd approach towards comedy.  Unfortunately, at
times, he interferes with the central characters and
slows the film down a bit, but mostly he is a positive
contributor. 
Other members of the cast are excellent as lively
caricatures of your stereotypical college student
(loves to smoke weed, party, and have sex, hates to
study). Seann William Scott is great as one of the
travelers. Almost identical to his character in
American Pie and to Tim Matheson's Otter in Animal
House, he is such a jerk that he eventually becomes
fun to watch. It's hard not to watch him steal a bus
from a blind lady and wonder what kind of childhood he
must have had. DJ Qualls is also great as another one
of the travelers. He's puny, gets pushed around by
everyone, and is only on this trip because the others
need his car. He's like Jason Biggs except much more
ignorant and helpless. 
Unfortunately, the ending of Road Trip is very
disappointing. A weak, empty finish climaxes all of
the crazy adventures that lead up to it. Predictable
and boring, it certainly can not stand up against the
parade ending in Animal House. 
Otherwise, you'll have a fun time viewing Road Trip.
Let your brain take a time out for once, you won't
need it to understand what is going on during the
movie and you won't need it to think about the movie's
message afterwards. This is the kind of movie, where
you don't know what will happen, you laugh really hard
with everyone else in the theater, and then you talk
about it with your friends the next day. That's it.
Enjoy it - then move on with your life until the next
one comes out in 2001.

Last summer, "American Pie," an outrageous teen raunchfest, became one of the 
biggest sleeper smash hits of the year. With a style that harkened back to 
the sleazy  high school/college movies of the early '80s, such as "Porky's" 
and "National Lampoon's Animal House," but with brighter stars and an overall 
sweeter screenplay, "American Pie," along with the success of 1998's "There's 
Something About Mary," have regenerated a seemingly dead genre, much like 
"Scream" did for slasher films in 1996. The first copycat out of the gate is 
"Road Trip," directed by documentary filmmaker Todd Phillips (1998's 
controversial "Frat House"). Maybe 'copycat' is too strong a word, as 
Phillips, who also cowrote the script with Scot Armstrong, has used "American 
Pie" as an inspiration to make his very own rowdy, lewd, and crude college 
comedy that, like its predecessors, goes straight for the jugular and doesn't 
mind shocking its audience, just as long as it gets everyone to laugh. And it 
does, in spades.
Josh (Breckin Meyer) has always been best friends with Tiffany (Rachel 
Blanchard), and once they became teenagers, their friendship turned to love. 
After graduating from high school, however, they were separated by college, 
Josh at Ithaca in NY, and Tiffany at Austin University in TX. Successfully 
holding a long-term relationship thus far, and making sure to call each other 
every day, Josh begins to suspect that Tiffany has started to cheat on him 
after she doesn't return his calls for several days. Egged on by his best 
friend, E.L. (Seann William Scott), Josh ends up sleeping with college cutie 
Beth (Amy Smart), who has had a crush on him. Taping their bedplay, Josh is 
horrified the next morning to discover that their sex tape was actually sent 
in the mail, headed for Tiffany in Austin, instead of the "I Miss You" tape 
that was supposed to be mailed. Worse yet, Tiffany finally calls apologizing 
for not answering his calls. It seems her grandfather passed away and she's 
been out of town.
With finals approaching in less than a week, one of which Josh needs at least 
a "B+" in to pass the class, he frantically sets out on an 1800-mile trek to 
intercept the tape before Tiffany gets ahold of it. In true comedic fashion, 
everything that could go wrong does for Josh, E.L., fellow friend Rubin 
(Paulo Costanzo), and geeky Kyle (DJ Qualls), whose car they force him to let 
them take. Meanwhile, Beth sets off for Boston (getting it mixed up with 
Austin) to admit to Tiffany that she slept with Josh, after feeling guilty. 
All of this is told in story flashback format by wacky 8-year Ithaca student 
Barry (Tom Green), while he is giving a campus tour for prospective students 
and parents.
"Road Trip" is neither deep, nor meaningful, nor particularly substantial, 
and it doesn't try to be. While "American Pie" seriously focused on 
relationships amidst the outlandish comedy, "Road Trip" is strictly a wild 
comedy, and it works surprisingly well, sure to attract wide audiences that 
break out from the teenage crowd. Trips to a sperm bank, an all-black frat 
house, a school for the blind, and the sight of an old man with an erect 
penis are all on display here, and while surely madcap and shocking, the 
movie is never mean, and unlike the gratuitous, offensive "Porky's," treats 
its female characters with respect, rather than looking upon them as merely 
sex objects with breasts. There are, however, some of the latter frequently 
on display here.
As with "American Pie," the entire cast works as a unit, and without any one 
of them, something would feel missing from the proceedings. Breckin Meyer 
(1999's "Go") is a likable, if somewhat bland, leading man as Josh, but he is 
ably supported by the cast that surrounds him. Seann William Scott ("American 
Pie") is a standout as the trash-talking E.L., who discovers, to his delight, 
a new way to receive sexual pleasure, and DJ Qualls, in his film debut, is 
well-cast as the meek, virginal Kyle. Absent from films for quite a while 
while he starred in Broadway's Tony Award Winner, "Rent," it is nice to see 
Anthony Rapp (1987's "Adventures in Babysitting") again, this time playing a 
creepy Ithaca student who grows progressively jealous of Josh when Beth is 
stolen from his grasp (nevermind that she has no interest at all in him, 
anyway). In the female department, Amy Smart (1999's "Outside Providence") is 
fresh-faced and proves to have a knack for humor, as Beth, while Rachel 
Blanchard (1999's "The Rage: Carrie 2") is underutilized and mostly wasted as 
the object of Josh's affections, Tiffany. Best of all, however, is Tom Green, 
hysterical as the loony Barry, who gains the most pleasure of all when Rubin 
assigns him the job of feeding a mouse to his pet boa constrictor. Green gets 
most of the best lines and overall funny scenes, despite not even being 
onscreen during the actual road trip itself.
It's difficult to discuss "Road Trip" without giving away its many 
laugh-inducing sure-to-be-talked-about scenes, but suffice to say, it is a 
very funny comedy, perhaps the best since last year's largely underrated 
"Drop Dead Gorgeous." It is also the type of movie that was meant to be seen 
in a crowded theater of high school and college students with a sense of 
humor, ready and willing to laugh. If, for some unknown reason, you miss 
"Road Trip" during its theatrical release, you will also be missing out on a 
genuinely entertaining filmgoing experience.

     Treading on the thinnest of plots, Road Trip fully earns its
obvious comparisons to American Pie, There's Something About Mary, and
even Animal House -- with one gross-out, slapstick scenario after
another, all wedged into a tight 90 minutes of running time.
     Witness our college-aged hero Josh (Go's Breckin Meyer), who
figures his long-distance girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) has
blown him off, leading him into a night of passion with local girl Beth
("Felicity"'s Amy Smart).  When the ensuing sex tape (why must there
always be evidence?) is mailed to Tiffany in error, the titular road
trip begins, as Josh must make the 1,800 mile trek from Ithaca, NY to
Austin, TX and be back in time for midterms.  And what's a road trip
without a bunch of guys along for the ride?  And no money!?  (If you've
seen Overnight Delivery -- same thing.)
     Highlights from the trip include an exploding car, a sperm bank, a
visit to an all-black frat house, a little Viagra (though not in
conjunction with the sperm bank), and a stolen bus for the blind -- all
narrated by Tom Green, who has stayed behind in order to feed a pet
snake.
     The acting, the line delivery, the music -- everything is as it
should be here.  Constantly we are reminded that we are not watching the
comedy of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks.  We are watching a "Beavis and
Butt-head" episode played by real-life actors.  Only funnier.  And
cruder.
     Thank god, each scene of Road Trip is played to its comedic
terminus.  Sometimes this is clever, often it's funny, and invariably
it's rude and disgusting.  If you aren't prepared for balls-out juvenile
humor -- and lots of it -- Road Trip is not going to entertain you.  If
you actually want a story, go read a book.  But if you want to see a bit
of nudity and a lot of potty humor, Road Trip ought to help you make it
through the summer.

The recruited young seatfillers at the press screening audibly ate up
every crass minute of this college road comedy--a scene that I am certain
will be duplicated in many theatres the nation over as the film becomes
one of the summer's sleeper successes.  However, if you don't find gags
such as, say, jumping a car over a downed bridge funny, likely you won't
enjoy the string of equally unoriginal and far raunchier gags that
director/co-writer (with Scot Armstrong) Todd Phillips passes off as
plot.  The antics are set into motion when Josh (Breckin Meyer), who
attends college in Ithaca, NY, accidentally sends his Austin, TX-based
girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) a videotape of his infidelity with
the fetching Beth (Amy Smart).  With only three days until Tiffany
returns to her dorm after a bereavement leave (her grandfather just
passed), Josh and friends E.L. (Seann William Scott), Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo), and Kyle (DJ Qualls) hit the road to intercept the package.
Just how much emphasis does Phillips give individual gags over basic
storytelling practices?  I did not know Scott's character's name until
the last scene, when narrator Barry (Tom Green), who recounts the story
of the film to a campus tour group, tells the characters' fates.  Green
will undoubtedly be the main draw for the young MTV crowd, but not only
is his screen time limited, Phillips and Armstrong don't find a smooth
way to fit him into the film.  The framing device of the tour has a weak
payoff, and Barry's involvement in the main story--he has to feed Rubin's
pet snake while the guys are away--is tangential at best.  Not that the
main story is all that great to begin with: just a series of uninspired
gags, ranging from the gross (a sperm bank interlude) to the insulting
(the white quartet is scared by a room full of black men--how funny and
progressive).  The trip would be more tolerable if this motley crew were
fun to hang out with, but with the exception of Meyer (whom I've grown to
like more with each film), the travelers are annoying.  Scott's E.L. is
basically _American_Pie_'s obnoxious Stifler with more screen time; the
character of Rubin is nondescript and Costanzo personality-free; Qualls
fails to command any sympathy as the token nerd.  If you're tempted to
watch _Road_Trip_ by the raucous trailer, be forewarned: it gives away
nearly all of the film's better jokes.

Directed by Todd Phillips. Screenplay by Phillips and Scot Armstrong.

"American Pie" was one of 1999's funniest films. Although it was most 
notorious for the way it pushed the envelope in terms its gross and 
outrageous content, it was also a very genuine and very funny movie, and 
this set it above other comedies of its ilk. Of course, any successful 
film is bound to spawn imitators, and "Road Trip" is, I'm sure, only the 
first of many. But "Road Trip" is basically just "American Pie" writ 
small. Although it tries -- and sometimes succeeds -- for the most part 
it's not as gross, as outrageous, or as funny as its predecessor, and 
most importantly it's lacking the heart which made "American Pie" such a 
success.
This is most immediately obvious in the movie's premise. Whereas 
"American Pie" told a very believable, unassuming story -- four 
teenagers' attempts to lose their virginity before the senior prom -- 
"Road Trip" is much more contrived. Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany 
(Rachel Blanchard) have been friends since kindergarten and a couple 
since their early teens. But graduation has meant separation, with Josh 
attending Ithaca University and Tiffany going to the University of 
Austin. Now the two are forced to communicate mostly by phone and
videotape.
But Josh is also the object of desire of fellow Ithaca student Beth (Amy 
Smart). When several days pass without Josh hearing from Tiffany, he 
assumes the worst -- that Tiffany has abandoned him for another guy. 
Giving in to his lust, he brings Beth back to his dorm room after a 
party. Beth suggests they videotape their romantic encounter, and the 
drunken Josh agrees. The next morning, he discovers his pal Rubin (Paulo 
Costanzo) has accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany in place of his 
regular video-gram. To make matters worse, he then finds out that the 
reason Tiffany has been out of touch is because her grandfather died 
suddenly. Josh decides he must go to Austin and retrieve the tape before 
Tiffany returns to school in three days. He, Rubin, and their friend E.L. 
(Seann William Scott, who was Stifler in "American Pie") convince wormy
but vehicularly-enabled Kyle (DJ Qualls) to join them in a wild and wacky 
road trip south.
In the wake of increasingly ribald comedies like "American Pie" and 
"There's Something About Mary", I expected "Road Trip" would go even 
further in the gross-out department -- especially given the inclusion in 
the cast of Comedy Central grossmeister Tom Green. Surprisingly, though, 
it's really pretty tame; only a scene at a diner is notably crude. Other 
moments try to be disgusting, but ultimately the cringe factor is 
unexpectedly low. Or maybe I'm just becoming desensitized to that kind of 
thing. Even the nudity -- which is about the only category in which "Road 
Trip" outpaces "American Pie" -- is generally inoffensive, although that 
may be as much to prevent the film being prohibitively rated as for any 
aesthetic reasons.
To be fair, "Road Trip" is pretty funny, but it never manages to sustain 
its momentum. Many scenes work, but more than a few misfire, or aren't 
exploited to their full comic potential. For example, at one point the 
lads pretend to be members of a fraternity in order to get a place to 
crash for the night, only to discover its members are all black. The 
sequence starts off well, but the tension is defused surprisingly 
quickly, and the whole thing feels abbreviated. Part of the technique 
used by "American Pie" and "Mary" was to take a funny situation, and then 
push it farther than anyone could have anticipated (the infamous "franks
and beans" scene in the latter, for example). "Road Trip" seems unwilling 
to be quite so adventurous, and is really a conventional film making a 
pretense of being controversial.
Much of the disparity between "Road Trip" and "American Pie" stems from 
the lack of characterisation in the new release. Whereas most of the 
denizens of "American Pie" were well-crafted and convincing, the 
population of "Road Trip" is mostly forgettable. Only Kyle really works: 
Qualls somehow manages to carry himself with a quiet dignity, rather than 
just playing the stereotypical college nerd. Although he's still an 
exaggeration, no character is easier to relate to than Kyle, and his 
transformation over the course of the film is by far its most interesting 
element.
Also very good are two supporting players who enjoy subplots of their own 
away from the main "road trip" storyline. Green, as eternal Ithaca 
student Barry, handles his material well and looks like he could easily 
carry a leading role in the future. Indeed, although I find the quality 
of Green's television programme highly variable, he's consistently 
enjoyable here. Smart, from TV's "Felicity", is somewhat wooden when 
interacting with the other leads. But once her character is misdirected 
by Barry to Boston (instead of Austin) in pursuit of Josh, she becomes
more comfortable with the role, and the scenario plays out amusingly.
The rest of the cast doesn't do quite so well. Meyer is amiable but 
two-dimensional as Josh; this is unfortunate because a strong center 
could have really helped pull "Road Trip" together. Scott seems to be 
replicating his "American Pie" character, but his material here is not 
nearly as strong. And Costanzo wanders through the movie in a state of 
perpetual listlessness, a condition which can only partly be justified by 
Rubin's drug habit. The meagre attempt toward the end of the film to give 
the character a bit of substance seems tacked on and is a poor fit with 
the film's overall mood.
It would be unfair to say that "Road Trip" is a step back for the teen 
comedy genre, but it's certainly a movie that is satisfied to hold the 
course rather than forging into new territory. And given that what's made 
the genre successful in recent years has been a fervent drive to push 
ever farther, that's tantamount to failure in of itself. "Road Trip" is 
good for a few laughs, but it's no "American Pie".

Barry (Tom Green) has been a student at Ithica University for eight
years.  Today, he is leading a tour group around the campus and
displaying his lack of any knowledge about his school. In order to
keep his audience entertained he must tell a story about the bizarre
events surrounding a road trip taken by his best friend, Josh Porter
(Breckin Meyer). Josh has been dating Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since
he was about ten years old, and they have maintained their
relationship even though they go to different colleges.  However, when
he suspects Tiffany is cheating on him, he decides to pursue Beth (Amy
Smart), a girl he has had his eye on for some time. Beth is a willing
participant, and the two create a home video of their first time
together. Unfortunately, Josh finds that Tiffany has not been cheating
on him, and his friend Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) has accidentaly mailed
the tape to Tiffany. Josh, Rubin, and two other friends, E.L. (Seann
William Scott) and Kyle (DJ Qualls), now must get to Tiffany's college
before the tape reaches her, and she finds out about Josh's
infidelity.
At long last, a film in the tradition of 1978's "Animal House" has
reached theaters. "Road Trip" is the kind of raunchy, hysterical, at
times disgusting comedy that "American Pie" wanted to be. A warning to
everyone: if you don't like your humor as obscene and revolting as is
humanly possible, stay away from this movie. Some of the film's more
abhorent parts include a scene where Kyle eats a piece of French toast
that has been through a journey no food should go through. This is the
kind of humor which will make you either cringe away from the screen
in disgust, or cringe from the scene while laughing hysterically. In
fact, you will probably react to the entire movie in one of these two
ways.  Most of you have, no doubt, seen the film's previews in which
Tom Green (The Tom Green Show) sticks a live rat in his mouth to
encourage a snake to eat its dinner. This scene would already be quite
funny; but Green is such an insane looking actor that he makes you
believe he might actually eat that rat on camera. Again, if you don't
find the thought of that scene at all amusing, stay away from this
movie.
The acting in a movie like "Road Trip" isn't particularly important
since the actors are only present to have disgusting things happen to
them. I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the film's cast
members possess some wonderful comic timing. Tom Green isn't actually
given a very significant role in the film, as he is only present in
short scenes.  Breckin Meyer ("Go") does a great job as the one fairly
normal guy in the film.  Amy Smart ("Varsity Blues") gives a
wonderfully frantic performance, spending most of the film traveling
from college to college, trying to track down Josh and figure out why
he suddenly left her. The two best performances come from Seann
William Scott ("American Pie") and newcomer DJ Qualls. Scott gives a
wonderful, over-the-top performance, playing the most psychotic member
of the road trip party. His best scene involves him aquiring the group
some new transportation from a blind woman. DJ Qualls is a rather
unique looking actor. He looks to be over six feet tall, and appears
to weigh less than one hundred pounds. The entire movie is almost
worthwhile just for a hilariously revolting scene in which he is with
a girl for the first time.
Unfortunately, "Road Trip" certainly isn't without its
weaknesses. While it may be hilarious for the majority of its running
time, it starts to lag a bit by the end. Things also get a bit too
serious and sentimental towards the end. Points like college kids
trying to live up to their parents expectations, and the difficulties
of college students finding their ways in life are suddenly brought up
in a movie where such messages don't really fit in. Thankfully, Todd
Phillips (who also produced the Norm MacDonald vehicle, "Screwed")
pulls things back together for the last ten minutes, and the movie
ends on a suitably funny and irreverent note. Watch for amusing cameos
by Fred Ward ("Tremors") as Kyle's father and Andy Dick (television's
"News Radio") as a motel clerk, who needs some serious lessons in
customer relations. I'd recommend "Road Trip" to anyone who loved and
misses movies like "Animal House", and to fans of Tom Green. Despite a
relatively small part, he provides some of the film's funniest
moments. The movie runs 91 minutes, and I give it a well earned four
out of five stars.

Comedy is hard, which is why most scripts stick to gross-out jokes and
easy slapstick.  Every once and a while a truly gifted filmmaker comes
up with just the right formula that takes the genre up a level with the
brightness of a script that keeps hitting its comedic mark.  ROAD TRIP's
writer/director Todd Phillips does this with a movie that is at the
level of ANIMAL HOUSE and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  The
good-spirited laughs come so hard and fast that you'll miss many of the
lines as the audience's laughter will drown them out.  Like these two
classics, ROAD TRIP doesn't pull any punches.  A tremendously energetic
and fun film, it's a real crowd pleaser that is more than humorous.
It's also erotic, smart and wild.
Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) have been together
since they were toddlers, but, now off to separate colleges half the
country apart, they've vowed not to cheat on each other.  Through one
indiscretion -- okay, it was three but over a single night -- Josh ended
up having sex with fellow student Beth (Amy Smart).  This would not have
been so bad if the tape they made of their evening's sexual escapades
hadn't been accidentally mailed to Tiffany.  Lacking the funds for a
plane ticket, Josh and his buddies leave the University of Ithaca to
head for Tiffany's school in Austin.  They want to intercept the tape
before she opens it.  This sets up the body of the movie, which concerns
their road trip getting there.  Needless to say, they'll hit a few speed
bumps along the way.
The story is told in flashback by Josh's crazy friend Barry (Tom Green).
Barry tells the story to a group of enthralled potential students and
their parents, who are visiting Ithaca.  This subplot alone is worth the
price of admission.  Once, when he has all of the girls in his story
having a conversation topless, he is interrupted by a party pooper who
points out that girls don't actually do this.  Barry tells the
complainer to shut up and that he will tell the story however he wants.
Along in the car with Josh are a Jim Belushi-type character, E.L. (Seann
William Scott from AMERICAN PIE), a scrawny, nerdish virgin, Kyle (DJ
Qualls), and a brainiac, Rubin (Paulo Costanzo).  Deciding to go with
their buddy is easy, except for Kyle who is scared of everything and
everyone, especially his domineering father, played by veteran actor
Fred Ward.  As E.L. puts it, "What am I going to do, stay here and
learn?"
E.L. and Rubin try to explain to Josh that he doesn't need to worry
since he didn't really cheat on Tiffany in the first place.  This is
because of "The Rules."  These include: "It's not cheating if you're in
a different area code." and "It's not cheating if you're too wasted to
remember it, because if you can't remember it, it never really took
place."  Others include the effect of having sex with two girls
simultaneous since they cancel out each other.
Besides the hilarious dialog, the movie uses physical comedy to maximum
effect.  There is one sex scene that rivals the zipper and the hair gel
incidents in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  Another one concerns some
old-fashioned car hijinks, as the boys try to jump over this little 10
foot gap in the road with Kyle's father's car.  Another one still has a
plump woman offering to give a used vibrator to Beth, who has her own
little road trip in yet another wonderful subplot.  Even the predictable
episodes, as when Kyle loses his virginity, are staged freshly and
sweetly.
The movie flies by with such tremendous energy that it's over before you
know it.  Perhaps the highest compliment that I could pay it is to point
out that it was one of the few pictures that I've seen in recent memory
that I would have loved to have been a half hour longer.
I really enjoyed my road trip with these lovable kids, and I think you
will, too.  It makes you downright nostalgic for a time that never was.
Now if I can just find out how to enroll in good old U of I.  Or at
least go to hear Barry's talk to prospective students and their parents.
The closing credits claimed that the story was fictional, but I'm not
buying it.  They just want to save all the fun for themselves.  Check it

This one was probably just another.
ROAD TRIP runs 1:31.  It is rated R for strong sexual content, crude
humor, language and drug use and would be acceptable for high school
seniors and older.
