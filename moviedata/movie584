"Make me one promise," Mac Brashear (Carl Lumbly), sweating over a plow, says 
to his son Carl, "don't end up like me."  A few years later, Carl (Cuba 
Gooding Jr.) finds his escape from the life of a Kentucky sharecropper in the 
newly-integrated Navy.  However, the recruiter's claims of a bright future 
for Carl turn out to be lies.  African-American seamen are restricted to 
slinging hash or serving as valets.  Carl sees that he will have to claim a 
career for himself against stiff opposition from a racist system.
"Men of Honor" is based on the life of the U. S. Navy's first 
African-American Master Diver.  The film balances Carl's life against that of 
Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), who is removed from diving duty 
after an injury to his lungs.  Like Carl, Sunday is a man "born to dive," and 
the loss of his career turns Sunday into a mean-spirited alcoholic.  When 
Carl finally gains entry into the Navy's diving school, Sunday is his 
instructor.  Like most of the cadets and the school's insane commanding 
officer (Hal Holbrook), Sunday hates blacks and resents Carl's presence.  
Carl, however, meets opposition with a fearless, iron-willed determination to 
succeed.
Although the real Carl Brashear stamps with approval the movie's 
authenticity, "Men of Honor" tastes suspiciously like Hollywood corn, Rocky 
Balboa in a diving helmet.  However, it's a high grade of corn, and a 
satisfying meal.  A movie like this has to sell its story to the audience, 
and in "Men" several strong performances successfully move the merchandise.
Not surprisingly, the most impressive acting comes from De Niro.  He seems 
well-rested from his vacation in comedy land ("Analyze This," "Rocky & 
Bullwinkle," "Meet the Parents") where he was needed only as an icon, not as 
an actor.   Sunday is a challenging role because the angry bigot goes from 
being Carl's nemesis to being his most ardent supporter.  De Niro pulls off 
the contradictions in this character with such subtlety that it seems 
effortless.  Sunday is repulsive, likeable, and completely convincing all at 
once.  This is De Niro's best work in years.
In contrast, Gooding has an easier job.  Carl is characterized by 
single-minded determination, and therefore doesn't present the complexities 
of Billy Sunday.  However, Gooding is completely convincing and brings 
limitless energy to the character.  
Charlize Theron wins the Not Just a Pretty Face Award for her impressive work 
as Sunday's neglected wife Gwen.  Also, take note of the always good, always 
underused Michael Rapaport as a stammering seaman who befriends Carl.
Although the script for "Men of Honor" is shamelessly manipulative, it is 
also effective.  When a room full of people give Carl a standing ovation in 
the film's climax, I was tempted to stand up in the theater and clap, too.

    Based on a true story, this is an old-fashioned,
inspirational military drama - which works for it and against it. Cuba
Gooding Jr. effectively plays Carl Brashear, who became the Navy's
first African-American master diver, while Robert DeNiro, as Billy
Sunday, is the manic redneck instructor who torments and humiliates
him before becoming his mentor. "Why do you want this so badly?" he's
asked. "Because they said I couldn't have it" is Brashear's meaningful
reply. Hal Holbrook adds to the rampant racism as the terrorizing
commander of the Naval Diving School. Powers Boothe is the first
officer to acknowledge Brashear's deep determination to succeed, and
David Keith is the sympathetic officer who's there when a freak,
shipboard accident cripples Brashear, causing the eventual amputation
of his leg.  Executive produced by Bill Cosby, written by Scott
Marshall Smith and directed by George Tillman Jr. ("Soul Food"), the
film obviously fictionalizes rather than depicts the various
biographical incidents that transformed Brashear's early life as a
Kentucky sharecropper's son ("Don't end up like me," his father
warns.) and his military career which began in the '60s with mess
duty. Gooding's and DeNiro's wives are predictably played by Aunjanue
Ellis and Charlize Theron, respectively, while Michael Rapaport,
Joshua Leonard and Holt McCallany portray other trainees. Credit
cinematographer Anthony B. Richmond for capturing the danger and
undersea isolation of the divers and the taut tension of the diving
program's final exam. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Men of
Honor" is a well-intentioned, if melodramatic 5, slipping into sloppy
sentiment a bit too often as it extols Brashear's courage and
indomitable spirit. The R-rating comes from salty language and racist
comments.

   I missed the critics' screening of "Men of Honor" and
caught up with the picture not in a sophisticated Manhattan
neighborhood but in a Brooklyn community filled with people
who are politically and social conservative.  As their voting
record over the past few decades indicates, they are strongly
family-minded, traditional, and at the Sunday screening I
attended mostly over 55 years of age.  The seats were filled.
Why did "Men of Honor" attract the largest audience of the
multiplex theater rather than "Charlie's Angels" or "Little
Nicky" or "The 6th Day"?  Because the other three films are
targeted to the young?  That's partly the reason.  But I'd
suggest another purely on speculation.  These are people
who are dismayed by the plethora of violent and sexually
explicit movies but even more, they are opposed to the
rampant cynicism projected on today's screens. They look
forward to movies that might urge them--were they just a little
less inhibited--to stand up at the end and recite the pledge of
allegiance or even sing the national anthem.  "The
Contender" would be a similar sort were the hero not a pro-
choice, atheist vegetarian who likes sex, because absent
those traits, who could resist the rousing call of President
Jackson Evans to a joint session of Congress to accept his
nomination of Laine Hanson to the post of vice president?
   "Men of Honor" shares the all-American thrills of "The
Contender" while celebrating an African-American man whose
political views are unknown but whose determination to
contribute mightily to his country is liberty-bell clear.  His life
could have been the subject of a dull, talking-heads biopic but
director George Tillman Jr. does a bracing job of bringing this
true American hero to life with all the force that a stirring
sound track (by Mark Isham) and lines-are-drawn acting
could bring.  If the music obtrusively punctuates what is
apparent in the struggle of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
to overcome racial prejudice in the post World War II Navy
(as scripted by Scott Marshall Smith), Tillman means well.  If
the obligatory courtroom finale is as schematic and schmaltzy
as the conclusion of Rod Lurie "The Contender," all the better
to appeal to a crowd less influenced by modern critical
standards to condemn the mawkish.  "Men of Honor" may be
square, but in recent years we've had all the hip we need in
the movie theaters.
   Filmed by Anthony B. Richmond with some tense, authentic
underwater photography, "Men of Honor" focuses on the 
struggle between Carl Brashear, who became the Navy's first
African-American diver, and a crew of people headed by
Master Chief Diver Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro).  Pushed by
his sharecropper father to be all he can be, Brashear enters
the all-white Naval diving program.  Despite his seventh-
grade education, he struggles through the initial written tests,
fails one, and passes the second with a reasonable grade. 
The real test comes for Brashear when he must deal with the
refusal of the entire crew save the stuttering Snowhill
(Michael Rapaport) to bunk with him.  (All but Snowhill walk
out...so where did they get to bunk anyway?) While Sunday is
determined to flunk the man, pushed to do so by his racist
commanding officer Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook), as he puffs
away on his corncob pipe--a gift from General MacArthur--he
slowly grows to appreciate Brashear's enormous motivation. 
This impetus to become a diver and even rise to the top of
his profession is made most dramatic by what Brashear does
to himself in the hospital while recovering from an accident.
   Since Carl Brashear was a real, live person who--as the
audience knew beforehand actually fought and won the good
fight depicted here-- we in the audience knew from the start
that this was a man that Billy Sunday could not shut down. 
Despite this, Tillman's characterizations bring out the humor
as well as the poignancy, making the journey to victory the
cause for celebration.

Prudishly and illogically rated R (for Navymen's salty language)
Biopics (biographical picture) have been a staple genre since movies 
began. They--including Hollywood productions--are overwhelmingly 
"creative," readjust fancifully the lives of notable persons, invent, 
adapt, prettify... and make historians despair.
Yet many of those films have been major hits. For example, the movies 
directed by German-born actor and director William Dieterle who 
achieved fame and glory with a string of  MGM pictures with great 
actors: "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (1936), "The Life of Emile Zola" 
(1937), "Juarez" (1939),  "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet" (1940), "A 
Dispatch from Reuters" (1940), "Tennessee Johnson" (1942).
There have been movies about baseball greats like Lou Gehrig, "Pride 
of the Yankees" (1942); about a remarkable polio-treating nurse, 
"Sister Kenny" (1946); about the famous nurse Florence Nightingale in 
"White Angel" (1936) (by Dieterle) or in the British "Lady with a 
Lamp" (1951); about "Nurse Edith Cavell" (1939), that brave woman 
who, during World War I,  helped Allied soldiers escape 
German-occupied Belgium and ended up before a firing squad. The list 
is enormous.
In the heyday of biopics (the 1930s and 1940s) the world was younger, 
the audiences more naive than now, the film critics fewer and less 
sophisticated, at least when dealing with history of the big screen. 
But flights of fancy and non-scholarship notwithstanding, those 
movies contributed a great deal to educating their spectators. The 
biopics were a wonderful  introduction to facts and persons which 
only a small fraction of the masses knew anything about or even had 
ever heard of.
Today, in the area of films about real people and events, the more 
discriminating viewers and reviewers are more demanding than in the 
past,  The case of "Men of Honor" is another litmus test.
It is "based on" (words that ring the alarm bell) the life of Carl 
Brashear who was the first black to be accepted (grudgingly) to the 
Navy's Salvage school. He became an ace deep-sea diver and later a 
role model hero.
In those days (late 1950s on) the Armed Forces were officially 
integrated, but there was still no lack of violent, rampant racism. 
It took superhuman will, tenacity, patience as well as talent to get 
to where Carl Brashear got. So what we have here is a feel-good movie 
and a feel-bad one rolled into one during two-plus hours of 
spectacle.  But how many of the details are true and how many are 
Hollywood?
What rings truest is the feel-bad side. Carl was the son of a 
Kentucky sharecropper whose struggle to survive is realistically 
shown as pure horror. Sad and powerful too are most of the many 
episodes of Brashear's painful rise within a white and openly hostile 
military milieu. Without revealing the march of events, it is obvious 
to me that this huge and painful aspect of the movie is its best 
element.
The feel-good part is another story. Robert De Niro plays Billy 
Sunday, a super-talented Master Chief and Carl's immediate superior 
at diving school. Billy is a rebellious, authority-defying maverick, 
an alcoholic at some point, and while superior at his job, flawed in 
many other ways. Yet he will turn out to be a man with a conscience.
All this could be true, but is it? And all his is vitiated by 
bucketfuls of movie cliches, excessive  colorfulness, improbable 
dialogue and speechmaking, paint by numbers progression, and much 
else that required a suspension of disbelief.
This story also echoes  quantities of movies that feature 
tougher-than-hell D.I.s,  movies about Marines shaping up on Parris 
Island, movies with typically Hollywoodian moments complete with Big 
Emotions made even bigger by a Too Big Musical Score.
De Niro, who at times is like a parody of Douglas MacArthur plus 
Popeye, has had better roles, though even  here, his being De Niro 
does salvage some of the silliness.
Even so, in the footage of Sarl and Billy, the two leading 
characters, when their personal lives are depicted the film piles up 
unconvincing or phony or cute passages. A sampling, in no order of 
priority:
In the opening scenes in Kentucky, we glimpse the boy Carl's 
beautiful mother. She is oddly chic within a context of people who 
live in misery --at least I remember her as elegant. The romance 
between Carl and and a lady librarian plus medical student is 
touching, partly because Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) is good and appealing. 
But the war hero commandant of the diving school (Holbrook) is so 
totally gaga that his mega-racism is ludicrous and ineffectual, more 
a mental case than anything else. Worse yet, Gwen (Charlize Theron) 
who seems to be De Niro's child-wife, is a totally useless, unclear 
and unneeded character.
Where the guillotine's blade falls is in the last sequence, set in a 
military courtroom. It is so "inspirational," colorful, sentimental 
and fabricated that the audience should be provided with certificates 
of authenticity.
The film does keep you going, does perform a good service by 
acquainting us with the unusual and admirable Carl Brashear, but is 
also as untrustworthy as the near totality of biopics. One would 
think that in the second century of movies there must be ways to 
maximize veracity and minimize theatrics. Yet the picture does have a 
saving grace -- in that it deals clearly with the scourge of racism. 
This can make us forgive "Men of Honor" many of its sins.
Technically it's A-1 and, I suppose, true to deep-sea procedures in 
sequences that make the divers in heavy gear look like immigrants 
from Jules Verne and "20,000 Leagues under the Sea."

Films based on true stories are unique cinematic animals.  To begin
with, if the story is popular enough, viewers already know the ending
(like Titanic).  Even if the tale isn't particularly well-known, studios
can ruin a film's finale by having the main character appear on the talk
show circuit prior to release, so potential viewers will know he/she
doesn't die no matter how much adversity they face in the film  (like
The Hurricane).  And if you've got a problem with the film's story being
boring, can you really complain if it's based on actual events?  I felt
that way about The Perfect Storm and was besieged with e-mail from
people accusing me of not feeling sorry enough for the characters  like
my review was really damning the crew of the Andrea Gail and their
families instead of the film.
Men of Honor was cobbled together with the same cut-rate glue they used
to assemble The Perfect Storm.  While its central character isn't quite
as unlikable as the money-grubbers from the Andrea Gail, the film offers
precious little besides a formulaic story, phoned-in performances and
button-pushing racial issues calculated to cause white viewers to hang
their heads in shame as they drive their SUVs back to the suburbs.
Honor is about Carl Brashear, who is portrayed here by Cuba Gooding Jr.
(Chill Factor).  The film follows Brashear's life from his family's
Sonora, Kentucky dirt farm to a military career during which he became
the first black deep-sea diver in U.S. Navy history.  Of course, the
journey from Point A to Point B is full of adversity, mostly at the
hands of the racism Brashear encountered in the 60s Navy.  He starts
his career as a cook on the seas of the South Pacific, of all the
horrible things.
After finally clawing his way through two years of training in
casseroles and soufflés, Brashear lands at a New Jersey dive and salvage
school, which is run by redneck Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De
Niro, Meet the Parents).  Sunday is a drunk with a corncob pipe (but,
sadly, no button nose) and has recently been assigned this training
position after severely damaging his lungs during a daring dive in the
Mediterranean.  He immediately takes a dislike to Brashear's hue and
makes him work 10 times harder than anybody else in the training
program.
The rest of Honor is pretty predictable (aside from a startling and
grisly injury to one of the characters).  We've already seen countless
films where two chest-thumping Alpha males butt heads, and it's not any
different here just because it's based on a true story.  Honor is slowed
down by obligatory romantic threads involving Brashear's Harlem
librarian  (Aunjanue Ellis, In Too Deep) and Sunday's strange
relationship with a beautiful woman played by Charlize Theron (who is
making her third feature film appearance in less than a month - The
Yards and Bagger Vance).
Honor was the writing debut of Scott Marshall Smith and was directed by
George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food).  The film features Gooding's best
performance since Jerry Maguire, but that's not really saying much if
you've seen what he's done lately.  The best and most exciting scene is
given away in the trailer.  It fails to inspire in nearly every way, but
does happen to be the second boat film this year to feature David Keith
(U-571).
1:20  R for adult language and graphic violence

MEN OF HONOR, by director George Tillman Jr. (SOUL FOOD), is so full of 
schmaltz that it leaves viewers in constant jeopardy of gagging.  
Although based on a real life hero, Carl Brashear, the first 
African-American Navy diver, the movie features a tedious script by 
first-time film writer Scott Marshall Smith that is so treacly that it 
could attract flies.  And just in case you miss the precise moments in 
which you are expected to cry or applaud, Mark Isham's syrupy and 
bombastic music will remind you as it blasts through the theater's 
speakers.  On the other hand, if you close your eyes and ignore the 
movie itself, it is easy to be impressed by the nobility and drive of 
the man himself.  Too bad that this movie doesn't serve him better.
Leaving a hard working life as a sharecropper's son, Carl (Cuba Gooding 
Jr. in an intense performance) signs up to join the Navy.  In the 1950s, 
the only positions in the Navy for African Americans were as cooks or 
valets, but Carl wanted more.  With visions of becoming a master diver, 
he works his way into diving school where he confronts extreme racial 
opposition and prejudice.  
In an unbelievable and way over-the-top performance, Robert De Niro 
plays Master Chief Billy "I am God!" Sunday.  As a blatant racist, Billy 
taunts Carl, whom he calls Cookie, at every turn.  Billy, Carl's number 
one nemesis, will, of course, make a miraculous conversion and become 
his friend and benefactor.
Carl is given a lexicon of cheap clichés to toss out at every turn.  
"Why do you want this so badly?" Carl is asked by a beautiful librarian 
(Aunjanue Ellis), soon after they meet.  "Because they said that I 
couldn't have it," he shots back with one of his typical sound bites.  
The overly long movie features lots of diving in deep, murky water, in 
which it's rarely clear what is happening.  Cinematographer Anthony B. 
Richmond likes to bring his camera in tight on the diver's face, which 
isn't particularly helpful.  Between the cloudiness of the water and the 
small glass window the diver looks through, we can't see much of 
anything, certainly no subtleties in the actor's expression.
The supporting cast is pretty much wasted.  As Billy's lush of a wife, 
Charlize Theron (THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) wanders on the set on 
occasion without much effect.  She isn't given anything of any 
consequence to do and adds nothing for her paycheck.  
Hands down, the strangest performance is given by Hal Holbrook as the 
diving school's head, Mr. Pappy.  Like a refugee from CATCH 22, Mr. 
Pappy lives high up in a lookout tower over the barracks.  "They were 
going to make him an admiral until they found out that he had more loose 
screws that a Studebaker," the ever-stuttering Snowhill (Michael 
Rapaport) tells Carl.
The story features lots of ridiculous and unbelievable bravado.  Carl, 
for example, is willing to risk his entire career, for which he worked 
so hard, in a breath-holding contest with Billy in order to help a 
friend.  Guess who will win.
Dragging the movie out a half-hour too long, Tillman, thinking he is 
directing an epic, finds few incidents that he doesn't want to 
exaggerate and drag out.  With music and other clues, he tells you 
precisely where you are expected to applaud.  Some in the audience will 
obey.  Don't be surprised that if you don't, you'll feel guilty.  With 
less ham-handed direction and a more honest script, this could have been 
a wonderful movie.  Could have been.
MEN OF HONOR runs 2:09.  It is rated R for language but also contains 
scary and gory scenes of diving accidents.  It would be acceptable for 
teenagers.

Once in a while, I refer to a movie as a "chick flick," triggering a
handful of angry letters from people who find the term demeaning to
women. Hopefully, this review will help even things out. "Men of Honor"
is a "dick flick," the kind of movie that male best friends slap in the
VCR while drinking a few beers. "Dick flicks" focus on men following
their dreams, manly men who never give up because, damn it, they are
made of the right stuff! Invariably, the lead character has issues with
his father that are either resolved in a cathartic face to face with Dad
or through a significant encounter with a father figure. Almost always,
dick flicks include a horrific accident or a death, with tears and male
bonding galore. These moments come late in the film, giving the best
buddy viewers time to down enough beer to comfortably sniffle along with
the characters onscreen.
"Men of Honor" is far from being a great movie. The production is
generally overwrought, the dialogue is trite, it's about 25 minutes too
long and it includes that most dreaded of clichés, the climactic
courtroom scene, complete with an emotionally manipulative score. As
someone who earns his living reviewing films, it is my duty to point out
these things and treat them with disdain.
But I must tell you, in the dick flick genre, overwrought is good and
trite dialogue is forgivable (after all, it's easier to quote on repeat
viewings). As long as the film packs a macho punch, there is no such
thing as too long, and courtroom scenes are welcome because they lead to
speechifying, and best friends watching a flick and drinking beer
absolutely love speechifying.
This particular overwrought story is "based on the life" of Carl
Brashear, which means that his onscreen heroism is probably close to the
truth, while all the secondary characters are suspect. Cuba Gooding Jr.
handles the inspirational role quite well, which is no big surprise,
since the Oscar winning "Jerry Maguire" star is essentially a
motivational speech given human form.
We meet Brashear in Sonora, Kentucky in 1943, as his hard-working,
extremely poor father implores him to better himself. Years later, the
young man joins the Navy, with visions of becoming a diver. Instead, he
ends up slicing potatoes in the kitchen, as a coworker explains that
there are only three options for a black man in the Navy: be a cook, an
officer's valet, or get out of the military.
He doesn't give up, of course, and his speed in the water earns him a
spot on the Search and Rescue team. After much work, he becomes the
first black accepted in the Naval diving school. But, although
desegregation is the rule, discrimination remains the norm. Save for
one, all of the other men refuse to bunk with him and, to make matters
worse; his instructor is Master Chief Billy Sunday, a world-class bigot.
As Billy Sunday, Robert De Niro gives a terrific performance. Snappy and
fast, De Niro creates a completely new man, instead of merely playing a
variant of his standard tough guy persona, as has been his wont in
recent years. Sunday, who also came from humble beginnings, is an
alcoholic cracker with a redwood-sized chip on his shoulder. He also is
very good at his job.
Like "Remember the Titans," "Men of Honor" deals with determination in
the face of racism, but in a more believable fashion than the Disney
film. Certain characters make inroads towards conquering their bigotry,
and they manage to do so without breaking into any song and dance
numbers, thank God. The film also boasts genuinely tense face-offs, as
well as some nicely shot underwater action scenes. Standouts include a
submerged test sequence and a gripping bit of nastiness involving a
rogue submarine.
While Gooding remains front and center for the entire film and De Niro
is given ample opportunity to flesh out Billy Sunday, the supporting
characters are given short shrift. Aunjanue Ellis has a few juicy
moments as Jo, Brashear's love interest, but is mostly relegated to the
background. Charlize Theron breezes in and out as Sunday's wife and
Michael Rapaport stutters sympathetically, while David Keith, Hal
Holbrook and Powers Boothe barely get their faces onscreen.
As an inspirational drama, "Men of Honor" is generic and poky, redeemed
only somewhat by the two leads and the periodic effective segments. The
film will not go down in the dick flick hall of fame either, but it gets
the job done in that department. My suggestion: Wait until it comes out
on video, invite your best pal over, drink a few beers together and be
ready to have a fine, uncritical, overwrought evening.

Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to a poor share cropping family
in the Deep South. His daddy's admonishment of "don't end up like me"
drives the ambitious lad to seek a life away from the farm and its toil.
Carl becomes the first African-American to serve as a diver in the United
States Navy, fighting racial prejudice, military bureaucracy and even
crippling injury to fulfill his dream in "Men of Honor."
"Men of Honor" is, at its heart, a guy flick. The inspiring biography of
Carl Brashear is made in the tradition of John Ford's 1957 movie "The Wings
of Eagles" with John Wayne. Like "Wings of Eagles," "Men of Honor" is an
old-fashioned yarn of one man overcoming every obstacle put before him,
even devastating physical damage, to fulfill his life's goal. Where John
Wayne's Frank "Spig" Weads must overcome paralysis and a failed marriage to
become a key strategist of air power in the Pacific during WWII, Carl
Brashear must face racial prejudice, narrow mindedness and physical trauma
as his main obstacles.
Cuba Gooding Jr. does a fine job portraying the smart, though under
educated, Carl. As a boy, he proves himself to be a first rate swimmer
whose love of the water makes him an ideal candidate to be a Navy diver.
But, in the 50's, a black man in the U.S. Navy had three career options -
cook, officer's valet or, as his chief tells him, "get the #$%& out of the
Navy." Carl defies the racial barriers of the time and challenges the
whites-first policy of the military. His commander, Captain Pullman (Powers
Boothe), sees past the color obstacle and recommends Carl for dive school.
But, for each wall of prejudice Carl overcomes, he faces a bigger one.
Once ensconced in the school, Carl is forced to deal with Master Chief
Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the dive school master who holds a grudge
against blacks. Sunday has the same roots as Carl - Billy, too, comes from
a poor, southern farming family - but has a deep resentment of blacks
stemming from his youth. For every obstacle Sunday and the school commander
Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) place before Carl, the young man hurdles past
each, steadily earning the grudging respect of his chief. Eventually, the
two men, Carl and Billy, develop a mutual bond and Master Chief Sunday
pulls in markers from his comrades to help Carl achieve his goals -
respected Navy diver and a Master Chief rating of his own.
This old-fashioned style story flows along in a typical manner for this
kind of bio flick. We meet a young Carl on the family farm as he tries to
help his father with the work. Dad is adamant that his kids go to school,
not work in the fields. This father's desire for a better life for his son
influences Carl, strongly, and inspires him to strive for what he wants out
of life. As the adult Carl begins his naval career, as a cook, the old
adage of success being 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration holds true for
the man. Carl has to work twice as hard as his white peers and, despite his
seventh grade education and with the help of an attractive librarian, Jo
(Aunjanue Ellis), competes with them as an equal. It's not all beer and
skittles for Carl as he must overcome the prejudice of the white military
bureaucracy against a black man climbing the ladder of success. As one
expects, since this is a true story, Carl graduates in the face of
adversity.
The final leg of the story has Carl, now a respected diver, called upon to
lend his underwater talents to find a nuclear device - a 50 megaton bomb -
that was lost during a B-52 accident off of the coast of Spain. This part
provides the most raw tension in the film as Carl is swept away by a
Russian sub skulking in the area looking for the bomb. This action packed
sequence brings up the bomb, but leads to an accident that costs Carl his
leg. The end of the story shows Carl, now with the help of Billy Sunday,
overcome his handicap and become the first amputee ever returned to full
duty in the Navy. Carl keeps his coveted job as a senior diver and gets the
Master Chief rating - the highest non-commissioned rating in the U.S. Navy.
While Gooding does a good job in portraying Carl Brashear, Robert DeNiro
stands out as the gruff, tyrannical Master Chief Sunday. Giving a perf that
is a departure from what he's done lately, DeNiro plays the son of a poor
white sharecropping family who escaped that plight and found a home in the
Navy. A product of his upbringing and the prevailing mores of the day,
Chief Sunday initially sees Carl's arrival as a threat to the status quo of
his beloved Navy. Carl's determination, ability and dedication to the Navy
slowly turn the chief and his attitude toward Brashear. The change is
neither abrupt nor easy and DeNiro puts a convincing spin on his
conversion.
The talented supporting cast is not given enough to do, for the most part.
Hal Holbrook is wasted as the bigoted dive school commander who refuses to
see Carl's inherent talent and ability. Powers Boothe and David Keith lend
an enlightened quality to their respective roles as Carl's commanding
officers at different periods in the story. They symbolize intelligent
officers who see beyond the color barrier. Aunjanue Ellis, as Jo, puts a
distinctive arc on her love interest role as she, first, helps Carl then,
later falls in love and marries him. Michael Rapaport is a two-dimensional
stick figure who is the only white guy who unconditionally accepts Carl
into the fold. Charlize Theron is miscast as Sunday's young wife, though
the actress makes the most of the small role.
Helmer George Tillman ("Soul Food") shows a deft hand in mustering the
talents of his actors and his behind-the-camera crew. Cinematography by
Anthony Richmond is straightforward and crisp. The underwater sequences
have a murkiness that suits the deep-sea environment the divers work in,
giving the film a you-are-there look. Production design, by Leslie Dilley,
and costume design, by Salvador Perez, are first rate and capture the
period feel with accuracy. In particular, the old-style dive gear used is
convincing looking and rings true.
There is a high level of sentimentality throughout men of honor. Carl's
daddy, as the young man boars the bus to join the Navy, gives him a
handmade radio with the initials "ASNF" carved into the side. This image
recurs throughout the film, a mystery until Chief Sunday, carves the true
meaning beneath the initials - a son never forgets. Another bit, after Carl
loses his leg, turns into a mini "Rocky III" as Chief Sunday drives the
amputee to overcome his handicap. These sentimental interludes suit the
flick, though, and blends with the rest of the inspirational story.
"Men of Honor" plays out the importance of honor and personal integrity
without preaching. As such, the story is a solidly entertaining one that
does not hammer the viewer with its message. It is an inspirational true
story of a unique man that broke the Navy's color barrier for himself and
those like him. Carl Brashear is a true hero and I'm glad his story is
told. I give it a solid B.

Though racist mentalities (and other obstacles) constantly try to put a 
stop to Cuba's undying determination to become a master chief diver; in 
the spirit of the Energizer bunny ... Cuba just keeps going and going 
and going. 
The title "Men of Honor" fades onto the screen over tremendous waves at 
high sea. As the waves topple, the brass instruments blare ... 
foretelling the melodrama to follow. It's a bit of a hokie film, but 
compelling nonetheless. 
Headbutting a couple of Navy MP's in the introductory sequence, De Niro 
wastes no time in taking command of the screen. His character is rich 
with unpredictability, honor, and rebellion. And of course, he's an 
awesome actor. Cuba's character, on the other hand, offers little 
surprise after he grows from a boy into a man who simply will not run 
out of battery power until he achieves Navy diver's highest rank. Cuba's 
acting is very good, but forever in De Niro's shadow. 
Michael Rapaport, who's been in just about every release this year 
(seems like), Forest Gumps his way into this one as the only white 
trainee who sympathizes with Cuba. 
I might have really loved this picture save for one too many jammed 
pulleys. There's also a problem of motivation in one tavern "tough guy 
to tough guy" scene. Cuba had just learned of some very sad news that 
prompted him to call the woman he fancied. While waiting for her to 
arrive, Charlize Theron shows up and coaxes him into the tavern conflict 
with a simple line or two. Seems to me, a man of Cuba's conviction 
wouldn't risk it all so easily. Perhaps a few moments were cut, leaving 
a gap in believability. 
Lastly, the film ends with text when it should have ended with images. 
That said, "Men of Honor," based on the life of Carl Brashear, is still 
a big movie with big acting, beautiful production work and 
kick-in-the-pants inspiration.

I just can't seem to get enough of the thrill of the being submerged in
hundreds of feet of water with the ever-present threat of drowning all
around me.  You know, that feeling of small animals crawling into my
wetsuit or larger animals deciding to eat me whole.  The intoxicating
sensation of my lungs exploding from gas build-up in my lungs.  How can
you argue with that?
There have been hundreds of diving movies made -- The Big Blue, The
Abyss, and all those Ester Williams movies in the fifties.  But wait --
the latest Hollywood diving opus has arrived, just in time for Oscar
consideration and to salvage -- pun intended -- one actor's career from
the murky depths of B-movies.
Men of Honor, based on a true story, tells the tale of Carl Brashear,
the first African-American to reach the rank of Master Chief Diver in
the U.S. Navy (taking place during the pre-scuba 1950's and 1960's). 
It's a valiant attempt to tell a thought-provoking story about
overcoming racism and working through the political machinery of a white
man's Navy (while being harassed at every turn by Robert De Niro).  Cuba
Gooding Jr. - shaking off the bad memories of such films as Chill Factor
and Instinct, portrays Brashear, a hardheaded, black, Southern son of a
sharecropper, who heads off to the Navy to pursue dreams of glory beyond
the life of his father and the farm.  In the Navy, Carl encounters
racist work conditions and Mr. De Niro - who plays gruff, racist Master
Chief Diver Billy Sunday with an over-the-top performance.
Eventually receiving the recognition of the ship's captain (a small bit
part by the great Powers Boothe), Brashear is given the duties of white,
enlisted men.  Two years later, Brashear is accepted at the Navy Diver
School run by that gruff, racist Master Chief De Niro.  You can imagine
what follows: The guilt-ridden drive to achieve the dreams of his
father, the trials of acceptance into white society, the conversion of
De Niro into a sympathetic character, the Oscar speeches about not
giving up and striving forward, and the near-death of our young hero.
You know what I mean, the standard Hollywood drama stuff.
The most surprising element of the film is the strong performance by
Cuba Gooding Jr.  His brooding face and stout movements give great depth
and pose to the character.  Too bad that Robert De Niro's characters are
becoming pieces of other characters from past movies he's been in.  His
Billy Sunday is a combination of Cape Fear's Max Cady, Mean Streets'
Johnny Boy Cervello, and Casino's Sam Rothstein.  Charlize Theron and
Aunjanue Ellis are strong as the quiet and supporting wives but stand as
the most underdeveloped of all of the characters.
It's a real shame that instead of investigating the era's racism, Men of
Honor just paints broad strokes -- people from the South or from
Brooklyn must detest all black people in the film.  Instead of fleshing
out these issues, the film is full of scenes that have now become
clichés.  The black man refuses the authority of the white man's rules. 
One man is determined to triumph over all obstacles in front of him. 
Too bad that after two-plus hours of meandering about, nothing in the
movie leaves you with much determination to do anything except go to the
bathroom.

I only regret that I didn't finish this review yesterday as I had
planned to; I wanted this to be a salute to son and my father - both of
whom served their military time in Korea - on Veterans Day.  I'm proud
of them both for having done what they did, and am very happy that they
both came home from their individual tours.  And though my son was an
Army Man, he - and countless Black military men and women - owes a debt
of gratitude to Carl Brashear, the U.S. Navy's first Black Diver.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Sonora, Kentucky in the 1940s saw Mac and Ella Brashear (Carl Lumbly and
Lonette McKee) living off the land as sharecroppers.  As hard a life as
it was for them, they wanted much more for their son; Mac insisted that
his boy stay in school, not stay home and work the land with them.  But
when times got hard, the son had no choice but to quit school and help
his father.  When their son Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) grew up, he enlisted
in the Navy, hoping to do the thing he loved best - dive - and make his
father proud of him.  As Carl left home, Mac admonished him out of love
to never come back to Sonora, and to keep his eyes on the prize.  The
memory of his father's words, and his own determination, stayed deep in
Carl's heart.
But the sixties weren't much better for a young Black man in the
minimally desegregated military. Brashear soon realized that while
President Truman ordered the Navy to let Blacks *in*, the Navy didn't
have to *like* it - nor did they have to allow Blacks to do anything
but, in the words of Chief Floyd (Glynn Turman), "be a Navy cook, a
White Officer's valet, or leave the Navy".  Brashear, though, had other
plans.  Chafing against rules that applied unfairly to Blacks,
Brashear's brash actions impressed Captain Pullman (Powers Boothe) of
the U.S.S. Hoist enough that he was allowed to serve as a Search And
Rescue swimmer - though Brashear quickly learned that he still wouldn't
be fully accepted by his fellow seamen, nor by the Navy, for some time
to come.
This point was driven home after he convinced Pullman to transfer him to
Navy Diving School, under the command of Master Chief Billy Sunday
(Robert De Niro), a hard-drinking, tough S.O.B. who Brashear first
learned of during his time on the Hoist.  Sunday, like the rest of the
military, had no love for "uppity" Blacks, and like fellow Diving School
students Rourke (Holt McCallany) and Isert (Joshua Leonard), Sunday and
his commanding officer, the very strange Mister Pappy (Hal Holbrook),
did everything they could to convince Brashear to give up on becoming a
Navy Diver.  But again, Brashear, befriended by fellow student Snowhill
(Michael Rapaport), had other plans...
The Upshot:
Past the story itself, past the history, past the drama of it all, MEN
OF HONOR is a beautifully shot and acted film, showcasing the many
talents of its director, George Tillman Jr., and stars Cuba Gooding Jr.
and Robert De Niro (my lord, can that man act his butt off!).  It stands
up there with the likes of REMEMBER THE TITANS as one of the best films
of the year, if only on the merits of those three alone.
Gooding first caught my eye in his introductory role in John Singleton's
BOYZ IN THE HOOD.  His Denzel Washington impersonation in "Boyz" only
hinted at his ability to strike at the heart of his movie characters,
but Loud tripe like CHILL FACTOR left a bad taste in my mouth for Cuba;
good to see that he's back on the right track in "Honor", playing a
heroic figure with enough personal ambition to keep his Carl Brashear,
human.  And though Billy Sunday is an amalgamation of many of the men
the real Carl Brashear served under, De Niro plays Sunday with a
fierceness I'm starting to think only De Niro is capable of; not too
melodramatic nor over-the-top, De Niro's Sunday was a character you
could love to hate, and hate to love, all at the same time.  Director
Tillman brought out the best in Gooding and De Niro, entertaining the
audience while we were being educated; and all the while, remembering
that while Brashear's story had an epic sweep, it had to remain a
personal story about what drove Carl to be the best.
Fortunately for "Honor", it had much more going for it than just the
talents of three good men.  Of the supporting cast, actor Michael
Rapaport must again be noted in my reviews.  Like fellow actor David
Morse, Rapaport's talent has been unsung for far too long.  This is the
third film I've seen him in in the last two months (the other two being
BAMBOOZLED and the otherwise-unmentionable LUCKY NUMBERS), and each
time, he's stood out among the crowd in noteworthy performances.  His
solid turn in "Honor", then, was expected, but nonetheless appreciated.
Somebody get this man a leading role! (Yeah, I know; but ZEBRAHEAD was a
long time ago...)
But the story itself, the history, the drama of it all, cannot be
ignored.  It's "easy" to make a movie about the Black struggle for
equality in America, and simply point at the racist White people and
institutions and say "Bad, Bad people! Bad, Bad institutions!".  That
"Honor" went deeper than that, went further past Brashear's struggles
with racism and told a more full story about Brashear's struggles with
*himself*, truly elevated this movie above the pack. The shame of it all
is that it takes movies like MEN OF HONOR and HBO's TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN to
teach some of us - me included - about many of Our Firsts; notably, Our
non-sporting and non-entertainment Firsts.  Sure, I was told of Jackie
Robinson in grade school, as I'm sure many of today's schoolkids are
being taught about him.  But what about pioneering Black cowboys, and
Black doctors, and Black airmen, and Black divers?  Are *these* heroes
being taught?  If not, shame on America's schools for "forgetting".
And, shame on America's parents - me included - for not making sure our
children have a more balanced education.
For students of American history, for those who knew but forgot, for
those who are deluded into thinking It's All In The Distant Past, for
those who want to remember American war heroes - or even for those who
just want to see a damn good movie, MEN OF HONOR is a must-see.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I grouse a lot about the state of mainstream Black Cinema in the States;
and though it still walks on wobbly legs, looking back at this year
alone, I recall many good projects starring, and helmed by, talented
Black actors, actresses, writers and directors.  George Tillman Jr,
director of "Honor" and SOUL FOOD, can certainly be counted amongst
those talented folks; and with MEN OF HONOR, he raises the stakes
significantly.  The question is not "Will Tillman's name be added to the
list of America's most talented *Black* directors?"; the question is
"Will Tillman's name be added to the list of America's most talented
*directors*?"  Period.
To read what The Man Himself has to say on the subject of Black
directors making movies these days, check out the interview with George
Tillman Jr. in the online edition of the "Atlanta Journal &
Constitution"  at

webboard regular "Los2" for the link).
Bammer's Bottom Line:
On a personal level, MEN OF HONOR was a inspiring tale of one man's
triumph over adversity; and on the larger scale, a wonderful way to
honor our nation's war heroes on Veterans Day.  Even those who had to be
dragged, kicking and screaming, toward a truly integrated military.
MEN OF HONOR (rating: greenlight):
Jumbe, Daddy - thanks for serving your Country as you did.
