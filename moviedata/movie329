   More people are seriously injured each year on the football
field than in the boxing ring, yet some people who are ardent
fans of pigskin pugilism point moral thumbs down at the
roped-off slugfest.  This is not irrational.  The aim of the
defensive guard is to block the opponent from galloping freely
across the gridiron.  The objective of the prizefighter is to hurt
his opponent.  Moral misgivings may be justified in the latter
case but the case for banning football is not at all strong.
  You don't want to hurt your friends, though, do you?  How,
then, can you expect two people who are bosom buddies to
confront each other inside the ropes other than for some
friendly sparring?  This is the question that writer-director Ron
Shelton wants you to keep in the back of your mind as you
watch his "Play It to the Bone," a picture that's so crackling
with energy that you sometimes take your mind off its
repetitive, underwritten screenplay.  "Bone" is about two over-
the-hill prizefighters enjoying their final fifteen minutes of
fame under the bright lights of a Las Vegas stadium.  As you
watch the Madrid-born fighter, Cesar Dominguez (Antonio
Banderas) riding across the Nevada sands with his sparring
partner Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson), one thought
must remain in your mind.  How can these two guys,
scheduled to fight each other for real, ever manage to pull
their punches and yet avoid giving the crowd the notion that
the match is fixed?  The big surprise will be that they not only
go after each other like a mongoose for a snake but turn in a
struggle ferocious enough to bring the house down.  Much of
the movie's 124-minute play time is devoted to convincing the
audience that the two chums in this road-and-buddy film
share enough resentment to guarantee a bruising brawl.
   The call back to arms for the two tusslers comes when
hours before a preliminary middleweight bout, one contender
dies in a car crash while the other ODs.  Corrupt promoter
Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore) and his partner Artie (Richard
Masur) call up Dominguez and Boudreau at their Los Angeles
gym, promising them a quick $100,000 to share plus a
guaranteed title bout for the winner if they can make it to
Vegas that very day to allow the show to go on.  To save
money, Boudreau and Dominguez do not fly to Vegas but
instead call upon a woman with whom each had once
enjoyed an affair, Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich).  The first
part of the movie deals with the road adventure that the
threesome undertake; the second handles their actual fight
and its aftermath.
   Woody Harrelson parlays his fine performance in
"Sunchaser" into a role that suits his talents and shows
convincing chemistry with his co-star, Antonio Banderas, as
they take on the long, scenic route from L.A. to Vegas in
Grace's bright green, open-top car.  Harrelson, however, is
burdened with a discouraging character eccentricity.  He is
allegedly a religious person who occasionally skims passages
from the Bible in the back seat and in several scenes has
visions of Jesus--who in one situation saves him from
remaining on the mat for the 10-count.  Yet he--as well as
virtually the entire contingent of performers--spout four-letter
words incessantly and in one bizarre, unbelievable situation,
Harrelson's character engages in a sexual marathon behind a
gas station with a mixed-up druggie, Lia (Lucy Liu).  
   Davidovich is the movie's scene-stealer, looking dazzling in
the final portion as she strips off her driving clothes to fit
into a revealing outfit recalling her role ten years ago as Huey
Long's Baltimore stripper Blaze Starr.  Sporting a temper of
her own to match that of the two testosterone-addled road
companions, she restrains her former boyfriends from coming
to blows hours before the bout while ironically egging each on
from her ringside seat at the stadium.   In the side roles, Tom
Sizemore evokes considerable laughs as the promoter who
knows how to play his chess pieces against one another.  
Rated R.  Running Time: 124 minutes.  (C) 2000

Perhaps I'm alone in this (though I don't think so), but I don't care for
boxing. In fact, I'm amazed it hasn't been outlawed yet. Think about what it
involves: two guys get together and beat the crap out of each other for the
amusement of others. It's like the Roman coliseum without the nice architecture
(or the lions and swords I suppose, but that's beside the point). Oh well, my
rant is over. "Play it to the Bone" may be a movie about boxing, but there is
surprisingly little involved. The first hour and a half or so of this film is
about the fighters getting to the arena. They drive, and drive, and chat
incessantly about topics which no one could care less about, and then drive
some more. I'm fortunate I didn't fall asleep before the wonderfully filmed
bout, which takes place at the film's conclusion.
Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson) are two
washed up ex-boxers. When a fight promoter (Tom Sizemore) asks them to duke it
out with each other for the first time, the friends can hardly refuse. So, they
jump in Cesar's girlfriend's (Lolita Davidovich) car, and head for Vegas. The
prize for the winner of this matchup? A chance to fight the world champ, and
win back the title. On the way to Vegas, the two friends find themselves at
each other's throats as they quarrel over who is the better boxer.
I know I usually write a little more about a film's plot than this, but there's
nothing more to say. I think "Play it to the Bone" is supposed to be a comedy,
but I'm not entirely sure about that. I might have smiled once, but for the
life of me I can't remember when or why. Most people know by now that I am a
strong advocate of directors shortening movies by losing useless scenes. Never
has a movie screamed to be shortened quite like this one. In between short,
pointless discussions between Banderas, Harrelson, and Davidovich, we watch the
car drive around. We watch it from overhead, behind, inside, and from anywhere
else Shelton can think to place the camera. Occasionally, the group will stop
at a diner and have a few more painfully humorless conversations. At one point
they pick up the horribly miscast Lucy Liu, who plays a sex and drug crazed
wanderer.
There are three high points to the film, and they all involve actual boxing.
The first two involve Dominguez and Boudreau describing how they fell from
grace. While brief, the scenes do offer some insight into the minds of the
characters, and what is driving them to fight one last time. When the two
finally reach their destination, we are treated to what is really a very
interesting match. I found myself truly wanting to find out how the fight would
end, even though I knew from the start what was bound to happen. I might even
have granted the film a three star rating, had it ended directly after the
fight rather than subjecting us to more pointless dialogue.
I've never been a fan of Woody Harrelson, but I've always found Banderas to be
a rather entertaining actor. I'm sorry he chose this script, which didn't give
him any amusing dialogue to work with. Davidovich's character is a bit hard to
understand. She's supposed to be the ex-girlfriend of Harrelson and the present
girlfriend of Banderas, but she's more like a mom than a love interest. She
does nothing but break up fights between the two men and try to give them
encouragement about their chances against one another. As for Tom Sizemore, a
very gifted actor, he's completely wasted in the role of the evil, greedy
promoter. The film runs far longer than necessary at 124 minutes. I suppose if
you're desperate for a movie about boxing, I'd recommend "Play it to the Bone".
Otherwise, I advise you to give this one a miss and grant it a generous two and
a half stars.

There is little of interest in the first third of this film beyond
pretentiously quirky characters spewing meant-to-be-cute retorts at cliché
beats, devoid of punch.
Then comes Antonio Banderas' monologue. He intimately relives a scarring
fight experience at the garden. It's "Bone's" breath of life. From there,
the beat becomes more personal, the retorts more endearing, a few even evoke
deep laughter from this previously antsy viewer.
Used-to-be's, Banderas and Harrelson, now boxing buddies (who supposedly
have never fought each other) stumble across an opportunity to clear their
good names -- and of course, win a title shot. Lolita Davidovich plays the
domineering ex-girl who routes for them both.
The film crowns during the fight scene (big match between Woody and Antonio)
as many a star make a ringside cameos. This lengthy sequence is so
passionately directed and photographed, that it seems the rest of the film
is merely a convenient frame for its display.
I use the word "crown" instead of climax, because the picture never quite
pops. The writers seem to have gone out of their way to create a film with
absolutely no payoff. Perhaps it's some kind of inside joke that I don't
get.

Play it to the Bone: going the distance
We all love the end of Rocky III, where Rocky and Apollo face each other on
the canvas not as friends, but as fighters. It's both violent and tender
somehow, knowing that they're tight enough to want to pull their punches yet
competitive enough not to even consider it. Sports-obsessed Ron Shelton's
Play it to the Bone is made of similar stuff, though, instead of heavyweight
class, best friends Vince (Woody Harrelson) and Cesar (Antonio Banderas) are
welterweight, and their fight isn't for the belt. In fact, they're not even
contenders of any kind, but are the undercard for a pay-per-view Tyson
event--the 'appetizer,' if you will--and they're not even the
originally-scheduled fighters in the first place, but last-minute
replacements, all of which serves to establish that, in spite of what Vince
and Cesar may think, this fight won't be about money or titles or any of
that.
For a while it seems like they're even tight enough that they won't be able
to get glove-to-face when it comes down to it, or that one might take a
respectful dive, but then that's what the road trip from L.A. to Las Vegas
is for: to get them psyched against each other, do enough verbal sparring
that they're ready to come to blows/hugs at a moment's notice. It's one of
those long long second acts comprised largely of exposition--what brushes
with glory Vince and Cesar are still haunted by, a little character
exploration, delving into what motivates them, etc--and it likely would have
driven us sleepy-eyed from the theatre if A) we weren't in U-Turn-ish
country (or, for Woody, Sunchaser country) in an envy-green 442 with Grace
(Lolita Davidovich), who, as it turns out, is romantically attached to both
guys, and B) Vince and Cesar didn't have such a muttering great dynamic
going on. As the trailer lets on, Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas play
wonderfully off each other, get themselves into comic discussion after comic
discussion. Granted, none of that really matters in the end, but all the
same, it's entertaining enough at the moment that you don't really care.
It's enough just to see this homophobic holy roller locked in a car with an
insecure foreigner, enough to watch how one's commercialized visions of
Jesus interact with the other's elaborate prefight rituals.
At the end of the day, though, they do have to fight on pay-per-view, for a
long list of cameos (James Woods, Kevin Costner, Rod Stewart, all the right
announcers, etc), or, really, for another shot at all the glory they've been
unfairly denied, 'unfair' being the key word there, as it establishes both
these over-the-hill fighters as underdogs. Combine that with the fact that
we always like the underdog to win, then, and Play it to the Bone's
introduced a little difficulty, a little of that necessary narrative
tension: how to work it such that both guys can win. The usual route is to
have one win the match, the other win the girl, but in this case the girl,
Grace, refuses to pick sides, chooses instead to root for both guys, to,
yes, root not for the people fighting but for the fight itself. And, as
their fight goes round after bloody round, Vince and Cesar both
hamburger-faced as Deniro ever got in Raging Bull, this rooting not for the
fighters but for the fight spreads through the celebrity audience, and for a
while boxing is 'pure' again, which is what every boxing movie goes for
(every sports movie, really).
This is Vegas, however, and, as we all know, Vegas chews people up and spits
them out in the desert. During Vince and Cesar's fight, at least, none of
this matters, which is a coup for Play it to the Bone. Where it doesn't
quite succeed, however, is when the rapid-fire dialogue stops long enough
for you to realize that the only real 'jeopardy' these two fighters are ever
in is so amorphous (missing out on that well-deserved glory yet again) that
it doesn't really function in the drama; if they do miss out on the glory,
they'll just go back to how they were when the movie opened. And, if their
camaraderie was any indication, they weren't doing all that bad. Add to that
the fact that you don't need to be even mildly psychic to intuit the end,
and the little things start to loom large: how awkward it is trying to work
the title into a conversation; how much the flashbacks seem to be stock
footage from any boxing movie; how patently evil everyone but Vince, Cesar,
and Grace are, that kind of stuff. However, Play it to the Bone just about
has enough starpower to overcome all that, and, for all those who disliked
the bittersweet end of that 'other' buddy/road movie Thelma & Louise, Play
it to the Bone, instead of leaving the characters midair, ends with so
little preparation that the audience is left midair. Not that all the
narrative threads aren't neatly dealt with--they are, and
satisfactorily--it's just that the end, reaffirming as it is, perhaps
doesn't mete out the 'right' amount of justice for an American audience. To
say it another way, everyone seems quite content to have been chewed up and
spit out by Vegas. Granted, all that mastication did bond them together a
little tighter, but still, the optimism feels just a touch forced.

I didn't watch PLAY IT TO THE BONE  I sat through it.  If you've ever
seen a boxing match where you wish the guy who was knocked down didn't
get up, just so it would be over, you know what I'm talking about.  The
overall limpness of this production greatly overshadows a few worthwhile
moments of comedy, drama, and sport.
Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson  WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, THE PEOPLE VS.
LARRY FLYNT) and Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas  DESPERADO, THE MASK
OF ZORRO) are best buddies whose careers as professional boxers are on
the downswing.  Fortunately for them, the undercard for the Mike Tyson
match tonight just lost its scheduled fighters to a car accident and a
drug overdose.  If Vince and Cesar can make it from L.A. to Vegas by
Showtime, they'll be paid to fight for the first time in years, facing
each other, with a title shot going to the winner.
Vince's ex and Cesar's current gal Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich 
BLAZE, COBB) agrees to drive them in the hopes that she'll find an
investor to fund one of her wacky inventions at the fight.  A
long-standing rivalry becomes increasingly heated between Vince and
Cesar as the trip progresses, jockeying for a psychological edge and
Grace's attention.  Add free-spirited hitchhiker Lia (Lucy Liu  `Ally
McBeal') to the mix, and Grace's feisty disposition turns downright
spicy.  A couple of decent laughs aren't nearly enough to sustain what
drags into a tiresome majority of the film.  The bout itself proves to
be a monumental battle, with both fighters delivering and sustaining
almost inconceivable punishment in their quest for victory.
The central flaw of PLAY IT TO THE BONE is its failing to convince the
audience to care about its characters.  The bout itself is less than
climactic because by then it doesn't matter who wins or loses.  While
Harrelson and Davidovich do a fine job with their parts, I found myself
less likely to wince at the graphic depiction of the boxing match than
Banderas' performance as an actor.  If you're looking for a good boxing
movie, head to the video store for a copy of RAGING BULL.

In the six months since Diva and I created 3BC, I've grown much more 
tolerant about movies; setting aside outright ig'nant crap like 
"Supernova", I've learned to roll with the cinematic punches, suspend my 
disbelief, and give a movie the benefit of the doubt--even those I give 
the redlight.  But I have a line that cannot be crossed: Bammer's First 
Commandment Of Flicks is, "Thou shalt not be filled to the brink with 
pointlessness"...
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Vince Bourdreau (Woody Harrelson) and Caesar Dominguez (Antonio 
Banderas) are best pals and professional boxers With A Past; on their 
last legs, they're given one last chance at redemption.  But their last 
chance comes at a price: they have to fight each other.  Called as a 
last-minute undercard match, on the day of the fight, by sleazy 
promoters Hank Goody (Robert Wagner), Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore), and 
Artie (Richard Masur), they head for Las Vegas by Bad Ass car [I'm not 
exaggerating; it should've been billed as such in the closing credits].  
Taking them on this inexplicable road trip from L.A. to Vegas is the Bad 
Ass car's owner with whom they've both had "past experience", Grace 
Pasic (Lolita Davidovich); and joining them after a pit stop is Lia 
(Lucy Liu), a "free spirit" who never met a drug, or a penis, she didn't 
like.
The Upshot (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
"Play It To The Bone" is billed as a Comedy, but it had me asking "why?" 
and "how?" so many times, it shoulda been classified a Mystery...
The biggest "why?" by far was the completely unrealistic road trip 
itself.  Work with me here: Vince and Ceasar have the fight of their 
professional lives thrust upon them; given the opportunity by the boxing 
promoters to take a flight from to Vegas, they instead go pick up Grace 
(more Weird than the Bad Ass the film tries to make her out to be) so 
she could drive them there?  WHY?  Folks, the BS Meter worked overtime 
on this one.  As writer and director, Ron Shelton could've solved this 
whole problem by making the fight be scheduled for at least "tomorrow", 
but noooooo.  This point alone damn near ruined the entire movie for me; 
just as the totally unbelievable explanation for keeping Nicholas Cage's 
character in "Face/Off" alive made me walk out of that flick in disgust, 
I felt the urge to do the same here.  But tolerance won out, and I 
instead just grumbled under my breath.  Of course, it didn't help that, 
at what Grace called the "halfway point to Vegas", she went on to say 
they were still five hours out.  Even given a trip down the "scenic 
route", the whole trip between L.A. and L.V. wouldn't take that long.
Another "why?" I mostly know the answer to already: why pad the movie 
with pointless cameos from the likes of Kevin Costner, Steve Lawrence, 
and of all people, Rod Stewart?  The HBO boxing commentators (Larry 
Merchant, Jim Lampley, and George Foreman), I could understand; but what 
with all those pointless cameos by animate and inanimate objects alike, 
two words came swiftly to mind: "product placement".  And while I'm 
asking questions, here's a "how?" for you to ponder when you see this 
flick: given that the road trip took 5+ hours, add to that the amount of 
time it'd take to do all the stuff involved in a professional fight 
(getting the boxers weighed in, physically examined, properly warmed-up, 
etc), and the approximate amount of time a normal fight would last.  
Factoring all that in, ask yourself how the sun could be in the position 
it was at the end of the movie.  Get my drift?
Some would say that my dwelling on such things only set me up to not 
like this flick; thinking too long and hard about a comedy, they say, 
often leads to disaster.  To those "some", I say this: I hate having my 
intelligence insulted; and once that happens, even at my most tolerant, 
the movie in question can never be taken at face value by me.  The proof 
is in the pudding: the vast majority of this review deals with the 
breaking of my number one Flick Commandment.  Shelton earned my disdain 
for taking such outlandish shortcuts just to get to the sole salvation 
of the movie: the big fight; and though the big fight made sitting 
through everything else almost worth it, I don't think I could trust a 
movie bearing the credit "Written and Directed By Ron Shelton", ever 
again.
All that said...the big fight was a doozy.  I was almost able to forgive 
the entire movie, because of what happened during the fight.  I'm no 
sports fan--and certainly after this, I'm even less likely to watch real 
boxing than ever before--but I gotta admit that Shelton et al did a 
bang-up job in those scenes (no pun intended).  I'll say this much: if 
you dig Antonio Banderas or Woody Harrelson for their looks, you won't 
want to see what happens to them in the process of their fight.  Though 
I was more impressed with Denzel Washington's physicality during his 
turn in the ring in "The Hurricane" (given much shorter time on-screen, 
granted), Harrelson and Banderas were no slouches in the squared circle.  
In a word, that fight was intense.
But we're not quite done yet with the Mystery: why Lia?   
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
A few weeks back, a 3BC reader asked me why I don't have a "Female 
Factor" as well as a "Black Factor"; my "Chickness" being as important, 
so the thought goes, as my "Blackness".  I've been looking for an "in" 
for a FF ever since.  Looks like I've found one.
I don't watch TV's "Ally McBeal", but I've seen enough snippets of it to 
know that co-star Lucy Liu is supposed to be the resident Bad Ass Chick 
there; having played a similar role in Mel Gibson's "Payback", Liu is 
likely seen by casting directors as the innocent-looking young thing 
with a heart of stone, a challenge to men and women alike.  I have 
absolutely no doubt that that's why she was cast in this movie.  And I 
have absolutely no doubt that it was about the dumbest move of all, 
second only to the illogical road trip itself.  As Lia, her entire part 
in this flick could've been excised from the film and scattered to the 
wind, with nary a skipped beat.  Of course, it would've put the sole 
onus of being Femme Fatale, square in Davidovich's lap--and with the 
bizarre way her part was written, that might have been one blow too many.
Bammer's Bottom Line 
"Play it to the Bone" rates a conditional yellow, for its sheer 
pointlessness; everything up to, and after, the big fight, had me 
rolling my eyes--but man, that fight was brutal.  I haven't been so 
repulsed, yet so fascinated, by anything in a long time.  If you can 
stomach it (and the "comedy" that precedes it), it's probably the movie 
for you.

PLAY IT TO THE BONE (2000)
GRADE: C-
Director: Ron Shelton
Screenplay: Ron Shelton
Starring: Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Lucy Lui, Tom
Sizemore, Robert Wagner
 
PLAY IT TO THE BONE reeks of desperation. It was written and directed by Ron
Shelton, who has managed to base his career on creating quality sports films
(and think of all the directors who can't make one good sports film). BONE is
his first major failure, a movie so derivative that a computer program using
only stock parts from past Shelton films could have assembled it. Here we have
the girl who is in love with the two completely opposite macho lugs (sounds a
bit like BULL DURHAM, and hey, TIN CUP as well). The two macho lugs are made to
compete against each other (TIN CUP, WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP). And the girl really
adores both of them but can never decide between the two, presumably because
the director can't either (BULL DURHAM). Though Shelton does throw something
new at us: This time all his female characters lack substance. BONE is
Shelton's own STARDUST MEMORIES, and like the Woody Allen movie, Shelton takes
every charming aspect of his work and overdoes it to the point of irritation.
Vince (Woody Harrelson) and Ceaser (Antonio Banderas) are two out of work
boxers offered a chance to fight each other on an undercard for a Mike Tyson
brawl. Okay, why not? A contrivance, or problem, depending on your perspective
(I prefer the former) arises. The fight is in Vegas and neither of the two have
any cash for airfare. (Forget about maybe asking the fight promoters to forward
them the money). So Caesar is hastened into begging his girlfriend, Grace
(Lolita Davidovich) for a ride. She agrees, though there is a catch: she is
Vince's former girlfriend. And hilarity ensues, right? Wrong. What ensues is a
lengthy, been-there-done-that ride through the desert, that had me incessantly
thinking, are we there yet? By the time we got there, I was just about to nod
off, but thankfully Shelton tosses some much needed (though completely
gratuitous) nudity on the screen. Thus, my interest was momentarily sustained.
Harrelson and Banderas are essentially doing the same jokey macho schtick
Harrelson did with Snipes in WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP. The actors work well
together, but everything they say, and every conflict between them feels
manufactured in order to pad out the running time. As characters they are both
underdeveloped except for some outrageous quirks that are supposed to be
amusing because they are so at odds with the characters other traits. Vince is
a womanizing, ex drug addict Jesus freak (he scribbles JESUS LOVES YOU on a
bathroom stall, which I admit, is a first), who occasionally envisions Jesus.
And, Caesar is a manly, velvety smooth Spaniard who went gay for a year after
losing a boxing match.
When the dynamic between the three grows tiresome, Shelton introduces another
character into the fray, Lia (Lucy Lui), a hitchhiker who practically demands
sex once she gets in the car. Lia is little more than a male sex fantasy kept
around for a while in order to get the male audience members salivating. Once
she abruptly exits the picture, Shelton has Davidovich change into an
alluringly slinky red dress with copious amounts of cleavage on display. She
even does a slow-motion walk out of the ladies room, while the camera
salaciously caresses her body. It's too bad Shelton never gives Davidovich
anything to do besides look real hot. She is personality barren except for her
love of "mountain striations" (another stupid quirk that I think was supposed
to make me chuckle but instead made me check the time on my wristwatch).
So how is the fight, you ask? Shelton goes for broke with his finale; techno
beats pulsate, the sinewy stars pummel each other into pulpy blobs, casual
views of celebrities in the audience (look it's James Woods in some hip
gold-tinted sunglasses!), and the aforementioned gratuitous nudity. Now how the
hell could a director manage to shove nudity in the middle of a boxing match?
Believe it or not, for some inexplicable reason Harrelson envisions silicon
enhanced topless ring girls in the midst of his battle. I doubt even Oliver
Stone could find meaning in that.
Now, I know, maybe I'm being a little hard on what is essentially a very 1980's
Don Simpson\Jerry Bruckheimerish buddy movie. What the hell was I expecting,
THE PIANO? No, but I was hoping for something a little less formulaic. Shelton
is the only director who has in virtually every film pulled off a compelling
story (with laughs and pathos) set amidst a sports backdrop. Here he takes the
easy way out, cribbing from his own material, as well as including nearly every
road movie cliché right down to the very antiquated, American car that is the
customary form of transportation in a road movie. Interesting that one of the
first releases of the new millennium would feel just as antiquated as that damn
car.

Writer/director Ron Shelton opens PLAY IT TO THE BONE with a long aerial
shot of the famous pyramid.  No, not one of those old run-down Egyptian
pyramids but one of the fancy new hotels that dot the Las Vegas
landscape, home to the lucrative sports of gambling and boxing.  As the
gaudy neon sign on the entrance to the city modestly proclaims, "Welcome
to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada."
Probably intended partially as a comedy and partially as an indictment
of the sport of boxing, the movie isn't much of either because of its
badly underwritten script.  "Somebody tell me why a Christian is getting
laid, and a heathen like me isn't," is typical of its would-be funny
lines.  Shelton's non-subtle idea of a visual diatribe against
professional fighting is to have two friends pulverize each other as the
make-up department applies increasing amounts of fake blood.
The story starts when the fighters in the under card (that's the warm-up
event) for the big Mike Tyson title fight in Las Vegas become
unavailable.  One of these second-string fighters has fried his brains
on drugs, and the other has died in a car accident.  The sleazy
promoters turn to a couple of washed-up LA fighters to fill the bill,
offering them $100,000 if they'll fly immediately to Las Vegas and fight
that evening.
One of the fighters, the religiously-tattooed Vince Boudreau (Woody
Harrelson), is an unconvincing, bible-carrying Christian, who regularly
sees Jesus and likes to write "Jesus Saves" graffiti on bathroom walls.
When Jesus appears, he looks like a hippie in white robes.  After bouts
of profanity, Vince likes to pray for forgiveness.  Wild sex with
strangers does not require any such remorse.
Vince's buddy, Caesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas), says very funny
things, but they are all in Spanish.  At least the guy next to me
thought that they were hilarious.  Not able to comprehend Spanish, I can
only comment on his English lines, which were singularly uninteresting.
Caesar, we find, was once a homosexual for precisely a year, but he is
vociferously not gay.  This plot device allows Vince to ridicule him
through most of the movie.
You might think that these down-on-their-luck guys would catch the first
plane to Vegas, but you'd be wrong.  In order to make the story into a
road picture, Shelton has them hitch a ride with their common
ex-girlfriend in her vintage, sea-grass green Oldsmobile 442. The three
of them bicker as they go along the road.
Lolita Davidovich, an actress who has given few, if any, memorable
performances in her career, plays their ex, Grace Pasic.  Davidovich
does provide the film's most impressive visual when she dons a shear,
bright red dress that barely covers her body.  She is cast as an
inventor of items from sox to periscopes.  She thinks she'll find
venture capitalists in Sin City to bankroll her ideas.  One potential
investor, the owner of the lavish Mandalay hotel (Robert Wagner), likes
her body but not her revolutionary idea for men's sox.
Also along for part of the ride is Lia (Lucy Alexis Liu), a wild woman
interested only in drugs and sex.  She gets plenty of the latter.
The movie culminates in a long fighting sequence in which Vince and
Caesar pound each other until their faces resemble squashed tomatoes.
The completely predicable conclusion seems like it will never end.
PLAY IT TO THE BONE runs 2:00.  It is rated R for brutal ring violence,
strong sexuality including dialogue, nudity, pervasive language and some
drug content.  The film would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Christian Critic's Movie Parables - http://www.christiancritic.com
DIRECTED BY:      Ron Shelton
STARRING:         Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich,
Lucy Liu
WRITTEN BY:       Ron Shelton
RATED:            R for brutal ring violence, strong sexuality including
dialogue, nudity, pervasive language, and some drug content.
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       1 Corinthians 9:24, 2 Timothy 4:7, James 1:2
PLAY IT TO THE BONE is a punch-drunk mess of a movie.  Containing a good
cast but awful acting; an interesting premise but terrible execution, Ron
Shelton (WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP) gives us a ROCKY story with not one Rocky
but two.
Rocky No. 1 is Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson, EDTV), a bald, tattooed,
newly converted Christian, whose idea of Christianity is not using the
name of Christ as a curse word... something that he has not yet
successfully achieved.  Rocky No. 2 is Caesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas,
THE 13TH WARRIOR), best friend of Vince who is currently dating Vince's
ex-girlfriend, Grace.
Both men are nearing the end of their "almost" careers when a fluke
provides them with a redemptive opportunity.  When both fighters of the
undercard of a Vegas based Mike Tyson title fight become incapacitated,
the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement.  Our boys are tapped
to fight each other, the winner of which is "promised" a shot at a future
title fight.
The film is divided into two sections.  At first, we have a buddy road
picture as our two heroes, in Grace's "sassy grassy" green muscle car,
travel through the desert to Vegas in order to make the fight scheduled
for that day.  Along the way we learn about their pasts and the
opportunities that have come and gone by.  Once in Vegas, the movie
settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between Vince and
Caesar.
Both Mr. Harrelson and Mr. Banderas have provided us with stunning
characterizations in the past, not that we'd know it from their work here.
Mr. Harrelson is uncomfortably awkward, apparently never having gotten a
firm handle on Vince.  The Christian conversion angle simply falls flat
and unbelievable.  Mr. Banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as
Caesar.  Weak and ineffectual, there is little life in his screen
performance.
The other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another.
Tom Sizemore (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), Robert Wagner (AUSTIN POWERS II: THE
SPY WHO SHAGGED ME), and Richard Masur (FIRE DOWN BELOW) are crooked
promoters, Lucy Liu (PAYBACK) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a
good time, and Lolita Davidovich (GODS AND MONSTERS), is the shared
girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers.
Because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between
them, the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the
boxing match actually begins.  But even then, because the outcome is so
predictably obvious, the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated
to just watching two men pummel each other.
Writer/director Ron Shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the
fight sequence as it is well photographed, well-choreographed,
well-edited, and well-performed.  If only some of that same detailed
attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film.  As it is,
the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another
are weak and laughable.
The title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film.  The
phrase, "play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the
way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal.  That
is a biblical principle.
"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the
prize? So run, that ye may obtain." 1 Corinthians 9:24 [KJV]
Achieving anything worthy in life requires "playing it to the bone".  We
need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to
endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between
us and our stated objectives.
This is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in
the developing maturity of our spiritual lives.  As a movie, PLAY IT TO
THE BONE is hardly worth our time.  But as a principle of life, the phrase
"play it to the bone" are words to live by.

Director Ron Shelton apparently likes the sports. He started off strong with
the baseball angle in BULL DURHAM (7.5/10). Followed that one up with an ode
to basketball and buddies in WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP (7/10). And recently
re-teamed with the star of his first film, Kevin Costner, in the golf
romance TIN CUP (6.5/10). Do you see a ratings pattern here, folks? His most
recent effort, which has to do with boxing, might finally give Mr. Shelton
the blow to the head that he needs to try another genre of filmmaking.
8-9-10...Knockout!
PLOT:
Two washed-up boxing buddies get the chance of a lifetime when a crooked,
obnoxious fight promoter offers them $50,000 apiece to haul ass down to
Vegas in 24 hours and fight each another. The duo accept but only if their
contract stipulates that the winner of the fight will get a real title shot
afterwards.
CRITIQUE:
"Something was missing" was the first thing that crossed my mind as I
ushered my way out of the movie theatre after seeing this movie. Some
elements were there, like the decent buddy-to-buddy repartee, the manly
humor, the woman caught between two men who love her, the ever-present
soundtrack, and yes, even some boxing, but "something" was simply amiss. I
didn't care too much for the characters, I didn't laugh too much at their
jokes, I didn't even care so much as to who ended up with the girl or who
won the boxing match for that matter. In the end, all I was left with was
essentially a "road film" with a little bit of boxing tossed in at the end.
The actors were all good, with Harrelson and Banderas providing some decent
chemistry, Lucy Liu sexing it all up, and Dadidovich, well, okay, I guess
they could have cast someone a little better for her role. She just looked
their mom in some scenes! Oh well. All in all, the film swooped by at an
even pace with just enough interest for me to stay tuned for the big fight.
Unfortunately, the actual moment of truth fizzled in my eyes and the
conclusion of the film just left me feeling indifferent at best.
I don't remember director Shelton ever pulling a symbolic ending over on us
before, but this film, and especially the, what kind only be described as,
"strange" boxing match, left much to be desired. I was looking forward to a
fun, hard-fought, exciting scrap between the two friends, but instead I was
left tickling my brain petals trying to figure out what some of the weird
imagery meant. Also, the fight itself was too repetitive, and way over the
top in respect to one particular aspect (I don't like to ruin actual details
of a film in my reviews, but hopefully you'll get my drift if you see the
movie). Overall, I would most likely recommend this movie as a rental for
sure, but if you are planning to see it on the big screen, I would suggest
it only to those who are huge fans of any of its stars. All boxing fans
should immediately drop their smelling salts and remain seated cause this is
definitely not the big boxing movie that you've all been waiting for.
Seventy percent of the film actually takes place on the road, and the boxing
scenes are just bizarre and monotonous. In the end, the movie made me laugh
hard a couple of times, smile once here and there, and shrug my shoulders
when it was all said and done. And save for one particularly cool movie star
cameo during the final boxing match, even the other celebrity appearances
were simply ho-hum. Rod Stewart?!? C'mon!!
Love it or leave it, the one good thing that we do come away with from this
movie is the realization that one of these two men clearly stands above the
other in at least one respect. And yes, hands down, the shower scene finally
confirms the fact that Woody Harrelson's ass can beat Antonio's any day!!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Tom Sizemore credits actor Robert DeNiro with turning his life around during
the filming of the 1998 TV program "Witness to the Mob", in which he
portrayed mobster John Gotti (DeNiro executive produced the project). DeNiro
apparently showed up on his doorstep with Tom's mother and told him to
either enter rehabilitation in an Arizona center or he was going to have him
arrested for heroin usage.
Antonia Banderas' full name is José Antonio Domínguez Banderas.
Woody Harrelson's full name is Woodrow Tracy Harrelson. Woody provides the
narration voice on the 1999 documentary entitled GRASS. He recently married
his longtime girlfriend, and former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has
two daughters. Woody also spends his spare time as the lead singer of the
band Manly Moondog and the Three Kool Hats. He was once married to
playwright Neil Simon's daughter Nancy for one year.
I guess director Ron Shelton must have a "thing" for Lolita Davidovich,
since other than this film and the previously mentioned "sports movies", Ron
has directed two other flicks, BLAZE and COBB, both of which also star
Davidovich. Lolita originally hails from Toronto, Canada.
This film is actually Ron Shelton's second attempt at the "boxing film", the
first that he directed. In 1996, he was co-writer on the film THE GREAT
WHITE HYPE starring Sam Jackson and Peter Berg.
This film was originally titled PLAY IT.

Play It to the Bone (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Woody
Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Lisa Liu. Written and
directed by Ron Shelton.
 On the boxing food chain Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson) and Cesar
Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) are closer to the bottom than the top.
 Neither is what you would call a contender. They're merely card fillers
- bodies to fill out a program, to whet the mob's appetite before the
main bout.
 Vince and Cesar also happen to be best friends. So when providence
strikes, it smites them both in the solar plexus.
 A series of accidents has opened a spot on a championship bout card.
The only hitch, Vince and Cesar have to fight each other.
 Thus is the premise of director-writer Ron Shelton's "Play It to the
Bone."
 And  I wish I could report that Shelton's movie delivers a knock-out
punch. 
 Unfortunately, it lands a few solid blows and several jabs, but never
can connect that emotional wallop needed to carry off the decision.
 Shelton has created some likable characters, yet it seems he had
trouble deciding what he wants to do with them.
 "Play It to the Bone" almost plays like two films: the first, a road
movie as Vince, Cesar and their girlfriend, Grace Pasic (Lolita
Davidovich) drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for the bout.
 The second, and much better half of the movie, is the battle in the
ring between Vince and Cesar.
 "Play It to the Bone" is gritty, hard-punching fun. But Shelton takes
too long setting things up for the big fight. He spends too much time on
the road. His idea, of course, was to allow us time to get to know these
characters.
 But Vince and Cesar start to wear out their welcome as their
alternately bond, bicker and recall past days of near-glory.
 The fight sequences are superb. And Shelton's dialogue is crisp and
clever.
 Harrelson and Banderas gives solid performances. They have the walk and
talk down pat and have that down-and-out, almost-made-it-to-the-top
look.
 Davidovich is sexy and charming as the woman who can't decide between
the two loves of her life, while Lucy Liu (best known as one of the
lawyers on TV's "Ally McBeal") is sharp is a small, supporting role as a
gold-digging hanger-on.
 Ultimately, though, something is missing. An ingredient is lacking that
would raise "Play It to the Bone" to level of Shelton's "Bull Durham,"
for example.
 It's that little spark that separates a champion from an also-ran.
"Play It to the Bone" had championship potential, but it just could not
climb to that next level.

Starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Tom Sizemore,
Robert Wagner,Lucy Liu, Kevin Costner, James Woods, George Foreman, Rod
Stewart, and Mike Tyson.
        Play it to the Bone, the newest addition to Ron Shelton's sports - themed
repertoire fails in numerous ways. Like most of Shelton's other great films
(Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump), this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use
athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting
subplots. Shelton's films are not considered sports films, but they do heavily
revolve around a specific game to tell a story. Shelton has been so good in the
past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his
collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races
living in various different regions. Play it to the Bone is unsuccessful
because not only is the boxing theme dull, but the side story of the two guys
and a girl travelling across the country is even worse. The film has no social
message like its predecessors. 
The relationship between the friends, two failed boxers who must face off
against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars, is very confusing for a
number of reasons. The whole film, since it is primarily a "buddy picture,"
depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each
other. Unfortunately, it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below.
1) We never see how Cesar (Antonio Banderas) and Vince (Woody Harrelson) meet.
The two are so different from each other, that a scene of how this odd
friendship developed should have been mandatory. 
2) Vince and Cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to Las Vegas.
There is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh
together or actually agree on something. 
3) The third character on the trip, Grace (Lolita Davidovich) stands in the
way. She is in nearly every scene with them, making it impossible to understand
the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each
other. 
4) There are two many interfering, irrelevant side stories. Vince is convinced
that he sees Jesus on a regular basis, Cesar yells at the sky in Spanish when
he is angry, and Grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner Robert
Wagner. These boring tales only hurt the central plot.
5) When it comes to time for the two men to fight, they don't even hesitate to
pound each other. Wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these
two are friends who could never hurt each other?
By the time the road trip part of the movie is over with, the film wants to be
over. Shelton, on the other hand, continues to tell his story. Forty five
painful minutes remain. The boxing scene between Cesar and Vince starts out
very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies. However,
the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable
after awhile, kind of like the whole film.

In movieland, January is known for two things. First, viewers get to
see those prestige films that opened exclusively in NYC and LA in
December to qualify for the Academy Awards. Second, the studios use
the month to burn off those action flicks and comedies deemed too weak
to make the grade during the competitive holiday season. "Play It to
the Bone" fits squarely in the latter category. Even though the movie
boasts a well-known cast and a writer/director with a great track
record, it suffers from a meandering, anemic screenplay and ungainly
structure. This is the kind of film best enjoyed on cable or video,
where you can lay on the couch and appreciate its pleasures without
sacrificing the time and money for a trip to the theater.
The storyline is the basic stuff of most sports movies. Following the
death of two middleweight fighters, boxing promoter Joe Domino (Tom
Sizemore) must find last minute substitutes to fill the opening card
for a high profile Mike Tyson match. He contacts Cesar Dominguez
(Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson), ex-contenders
who now eke out a living as sparring partners in a sleazy LA gym, and
offers $50,000 to each man, with the promise that the winner will get
a shot at the middleweight championship.
With visions of success and fame dancing through their heads, the best
friends convince Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), who has been
romantically involved with both men, to give them a ride to Las
Vegas. And so the three hop in her lime-green 1972 Olds convertible
and leave for the big match, taking the "scenic route" to pad out the
movie.
The bulk of "Play It to the Bone" is a road story and it's a long
drive. Writer/director Ron Shelton, known for finely drawn
examinations of the relationship dynamics between athletes ("Bull
Durham," "White Men Can't Jump," "Tin Cup"), creates some sparkling
moments, but not enough to keep the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas
from becoming tedious. When the guys finally square off in the ring,
the film kicks into high gear, with dynamic play by play scenes that
pack a visceral wallop. But then Shelton spoils things with a cop-out
denouement that leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson do admirable work fleshing out
their characters. Using an uncharacteristically simplistic sit-com
mentality, Shelton gives each man one major personality quirk to make
him more colorful. Banderas' Cesar casually mentions that, after
losing a match to a gay boxer, he "tried being a fag for about a
year," in the superstitious hope of capturing the winning spirit of
his victor. Harrelson's Vince is an unfocused born-again Christian and
reacts to his friend's revelation with disgust, fueling numerous
arguments between the two.
Banderas is good in his most challenging English language role to
date. He paints Cesar as a none-too-bright, extremely likable man
whose machismo is neatly balanced by his gentle, childlike side. His
openness concerning his sexual confusion is refreshing and adds to the
charm of the character. Although playing an ornery redneck is nothing
new for Harrelson, he still acquits himself nicely, although, with
each new film, the rabid dog gleam in his eye becomes a bit more
pronounced, pulling him further and further away from that sweet,
innocent bartender I loved so much on "Cheers."
In the middle of the mix is Grace, who plays mind games with both men
to juice them up for the match. Easily smarter than both guys put
together, Grace knows just what to say to ratchet up the tension
level, and Lolita Davidovich deftly adds layers of vitality and heart
to her thinly-written character. "Ally McBeal's" Lucy Liu pops up
briefly as a fiery hitchhiker. Liu is clearly intended to increase the
sizzle within the trio, but comes off more as just another way for
Shelton to kill time before the trio arrives in Las Vegas.
Why he felt the need to stretch out the road trip is beyond me. To be
sure, for the climactic boxing match to have sufficient dramatic
impact, we need time to get to know the players, but devoting
two-thirds of the movie to the journey is absurd. After a while, I
felt like a kid sitting in the back seat of the convertible, bouncing
up and down while pleading "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" Once
we do arrive, Banderas and Harrelson are so entertaining in their
exhaustive big bout (complete with some very funny hallucinations)
that the main question becomes "was that trip really necessary?" Had
Ron Shelton pared about 30 minutes off the drive, the answer might
have been "Yes."

Director-Ron Shelton
Canadian Rating-14A
We know Ron Shelton can do sports movies. He has a knack for capturing
the familiar ups and downs accompanied by professional athletics, from
baseball (`Bull Durham') to basketball
(`White Men Can't Jump') to golf (`Tin Cup'). With `Play it to the
Bone', Shelton has
tip-toed in boxing territory. Unfortunately, `Play It' is not a sports
movie - it's a road movie
about sports. This sets up an unnecessary obstacle course that Shelton
has difficulty in
overcoming, and the audience is short-changed with predictability in the
process.
Right down to the bare details, `Play it to the Bone' is a guy movie. We
open in Las Vegas,
where the undercard match for the upcoming Mike Tyson fight has just hit
a patch of trouble.
One of the boxers is dead, and the other is doped up in a hotel room,
surrounded by half-naked
prostitutes. Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore) needs two new fighters, and fast.
So he decides to
recruit a pair of washed-up boxing buddies named Vince Boudreau (Woody
Harrelson) and
Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas). As best friends, it's an awkward
position for Vince and Cesar to be duking it out in the ring, but a
handsome $100,000 purse aids in the decision
process. Within a few hours, the two chums are traveling the road to
Vegas, with juggled
girlfriend Grace (Lolita Davidovich) behind the wheel. `Play it to the
Bone' actually doesn't
venture into boxing until the final blood-soaked bout between Vince and
Cesar. Until then, it's a road movie, in which we admire the attractive
Nevada desert scenery and marvel at the
inconsistent attempts at solid character development. Shelton's
screenplay is obvious and
derivative, but to his credit, the story moves at a relatively
harmonious pace and the viewer's
attention never strays too far.
During their trek to Vegas, we are obviously intended to learn important
details about the
characters of Vince and Cesar. The extent of Shelton's personality
navigation leads us to the
realization that Cesar once experimented with homosexuality after a
humiliating match in
Vegas, and that Vince regularly sees Jesus. Great, huh? To add a little
dash of spice, Shelton
adds the character of Lia (Lucy Lui), a confused sex kitten who joins
the car pool when she
offers to buy gas and waffles. Although it's occasionally quite funny,
it's safe to say that `Play
it to the Bone' has its priorities in a tangle. The final boxing tussle
between the two friends is a
bloody, merciless war of well-choreographed cuts and jabs. Grace, who
runs from corner to
corner to offer advice and encouragement, can't bear to watch as the
bone-crunching battle
continues through several rounds. She has the same problem as the
audience: knowing both the fighters, she doesn't want either to lose.
The big scuffle, though exciting, is an awkward
predicament for everyone involved, and Shelton doesn't pull the right
punches to emerge
unscathed.
Harrelson and Banderas do fine jobs. I was particularly impressed with
Antonio, who is
displaying more range and versatility than his sullen `Desperado' days.
Both actors look very
convincing in the ring. With Grace, Lolita Davidovich creates an
interesting character. She
offers some feminine stability to separate the testosterone-driven Vince
and Cesar, and most of the time it works. Sadly, like many things in the
movie, her character is little more than an
elaborate cliché. While he totally explored the sport of baseball in
`Bull Durham' (possibly his
best), Shelton does little more than scratch the surface of boxing.
There is urgency lacking in
his approach, and even by simple guy-movie standards, there is something
missing. One thing
that is guaranteed - a Ron Shelton trademark - are a few raunchy moments
sprinkled here and
there.
Go with a group of your guy buddies, and you may enjoy this predictable
Shelton offering. But
overall, `Play it to the Bone' misses the knock-out. It merely circles,
looking for an opportunity
to strike that never quite arises.

 From writer/director Ron Shelton we've come to expect good
sports movies like Bull Durham (baseball), Tin Cup (golf), and White
Men Can't Jump (basketball) but this flimsy, raunchy story about
over-the-hill boxers doesn't measure up. Woody Harrelson plays a bald,
tattooed eccentric who has found Jesus - but hasn't worked in
years. Neither has his rival and best-buddy, Antonio Banderas, who
happens to be dating his ex-girl-friend, Lolita Davidovich when,
suddenly, they get the chance of a lifetime. It seems two middleweight
fighters have canceled and a sleazy promoter (Tom Sizemore) asks them
to be the opening card of a Mike Tyson bout at Vegas' Mandalay Bay
Hotel.  The job promises big money - $50,000 each - plus a bid for the
middleweight championship, but there's a catch: they have to get there
immediately. Fortunately, Davidovich has a grass-green 1972 Olds 442,
so they take off from L.A. scrambling through the sizzling
desert. Now, right away, one wonders why the hotel didn't send a jet -
or at least plane tickets - but that's part of the problem if the
underwritten script. Besides, half the film is spent on the road trip
in which we learn more than we ever wanted to know about the bickering
threesome, plus there's Lucy Liu as a free-spirited hitchhiker. By the
way, the title refers to the commitment of not quitting until you've
achieved your goal. Finally, the fighters get into the ring but, by
that time, I was ready to throw in the towel. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, Play It To The Bone is a fumbling, flat-footed,
formulaic 3, filled with foul language. In one scene, Harrelson says:
"Any guy with any gal is a mismatch - we're just not equipped to go
the distance." Neither is this movie.

With all the fuss that was made about Fight Club, it was a hell of a
letdown when the movie turned out to suck. Well, for all of us that
were sorely disappointed by the misbegotten David Fincher satire, along
comes Ron Shelton's Play It to the Bone, a film that deals with the
same themes in a similar fashion but is actually good. Funny, exciting,
sometimes profound and kind of sweet, it upstages the pretentious, mean-
spirited Fight Club in every way possible.
This movie has had the fiercest advertising campaign for a non-event
movie in recent memory, so regular moviegoers should have had the plot
drilled into their heads already. If not, it's very simple: Cesar
Dominguez and Vince Boudreau, two failed, over-the-hill middleweight
boxers, receive a phone call while they're training in the gym one
afternoon. It seems that the undercard fight for Mike Tyson can't take
place -- one of the boxers is dead and the other is stoned out of his
mind. Big-time Las Vegas program coordinators headed by Tom Sizemore
need two boxers desperately. They're willing to give Dominguez and
Boudreau $50,000 a piece and a guaranteed shot at a title if they come
to Las Vegas and fight each other that night.
They enlist the companionship and support (as well as the vehicle) of
Grase Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), an indecisive woman who, at some
point, had a relationship with both boxers; 6 years with Vince and 6
months with Cesar. Together they drive to Vegas (taking a detour, of
course, to look at rock striations). During the drive, Cesar tells
about his experimentation with homosexuality, as well as his crushing
loss in Madison Square Garden years prior. Soon, Cesar and Vince start
bickering, obviously trying to make it easier to hit each other later.
Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Lucy Liu), who proceeds to
seduce Vince and piss off Grace. Tom Sizemore shouts and curses for
almost all of his screen time. Grace Pasic seems like a great woman and
Cesar and Vince are people we don't mind spending time with. By the
time the all-important match approaches, we feel like the outcome
matters because the characters have really grown on us during the past
two hours.
Some writers have attacked this movie for the neutrality of its
climactic bout, offering the fact that we can't really root for either
contestant as a quibble. That is probably the most absurd criticism of
a movie that I've ever heard, this side of the idiots who chastised
Eyes Wide Shut for being unerotic. The fight is exciting precisely
because we don't know whom to root for. Rooting isn't the point and
that's exactly the intention. Shelton aims beyond the basic
entertainment value of a "big game" moment.
Antonio Banderas has finally found a role where his accent suits him
well and Harrelson was born to play Vince. But the real discovery here
is Lolita Davidovich. The 38-year-old Canadian-born actress recently
had smaller parts in Gods and Monsters and Mystery, Alaska, but her
breakthrough comes here. She brings a vital intelligence and sweetness
to the role, forming a likable character whom we have no trouble
accepting as an emotional catalyst for Cesar and Vince. When she's on
screen, the movie can do no wrong.
Ron Shelton has a passion and an eye for sports movies, previously
directing the Kevin Costner baseball vehicle Bull Durham as well as the
Harrelson/Wesley Snipes basketball movie White Men Can Jump. He directs
Play It to the Bone with a sure hand, never afraid to take his time but
also not forgetting to make things interesting. The climax is a
screaming menagerie of camera tricks so skillfully put together you
can't take your eyes off the screen.
It's not uncommon for relatively modest flicks like this one to be
lambasted from nearly every direction while pretentious crap like The
Hurricane is met with nearly unanimous critical hosannas. I'll hold my
ground as a staunch defender of the innocent
