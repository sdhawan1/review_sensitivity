I'm usually impressed by Showtime's made-for-television movies
but this family-oriented updating of the Rip Van Winkle legend is just
dull. The story begins in 1980 in the tiny town of Suttersville,
Oregon, where Jack Epson (James McDaniel) is married to Annie (Mel
Harris) and they have a ten year-old daughter (Brittany
Moldowan). Jack's a dreamer, a romantic who is lured into the woods by
magical spirit guides who have been monitoring the uneasy balance
between nature and development for 250 years. As a political activist
and deeply caring man, Jack's been chosen to be their mortal spokesman
to save Suttersville from itself.  The spirit guides entice him to
drink from a mysterious spring so he sleeps for 20 years. When he
awakens, he returns to the disturbing, high-tech world of 2000.  His
family believes he deserted them, and his daughter (Karen H. Holness)
has a ten year-old of her own now; it's this boy (Neil Denis) who
helps Jack understand not only what's befallen him but what he must do
to prove his worth. The villain is a real-estate developer (John
Novak) who is secretly planning to build a condominium complex on a
pristine mountain. Co-written and directed by Ernest Thompson ("On
Golden Pond"), it's filled with stilted, flowery platitudes and sappy,
contrived emotions. In a peculiar nod to political correctness, Jack
and Annie are a mixed-racial couple, as are the grown daughter and her
beau, yet this fact is never acknowledged, as if it presented no
conflict to anyone in rural America in 1980 nor in the present. On the
Granger Made-for-TV Movie Gauge, "Out of Time" is a slow-paced,
forgettable 4 with an admirable, if heavy-handed, environmentalist
message about the questionable advances of progress.
