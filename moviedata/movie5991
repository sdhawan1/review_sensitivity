"Stolen Hours" asks a very intriguing question:  If you found out you had
only a year left in which to live your life, how would you live it?  It's
a question most people never want to think about, but one which the
central character of "Stolen Hours" is faced with.
Susan Hayward plays that character, a woman suffering from headaches and
minor paralysis, who discovers that she has a terminal form of brain
cancer and has 10 to 12 months to live.  She is tricked by some friends
into seeing a doctor at a party she is holding, and he ends up becoming
both her full-time physician and later on, her husband.
It's a tough subject and the film handles it well.  About halfway through,
I realized something.  I realized that I was watching a movie intended for
adults.  In this day and age when the 18-25 demographic is the most
important thing out there, it was a refreshing change to watch a movie
that was not meant for adolescents.  This is a film about the fear that
comes with knowing that the end is near.
Hayward handles the part excellently.  She doesn't get hysterical as one
might expect, but instead handles herself with a quiet dignity that is
almost heartbreaking.  She wants to get the audience to put themselves in
her place, to think about how information like that would change a persons
life.  She gives a very open and honest performance, and I didn't find any
inconsistencies in it.
"Stolen Hours" is the type of film that is rarely made anymore.  There are
no major conflicts within the story, no big revelations made, and no
useless sub-plots.  That's too bad, because movies like this are what make
watching movies interesting.  They make you think.
