     This gem of a short film is a biting satire of the music business, and the
exploitation of dead rock stars.  The film begins with a commercial for the new
album recorded by the dead Elvis Presley, a double album that is silent [no
music; remember - he's dead!].  It's titled "Presley Comes Alive," and we are
exhorted to buy, buy, buy now, now, now!  There follows a press conference
where it is announced that, to counteract the drop in sales of Elvis
memorabilia, the promotion company, Elvis Exploitation, Inc., has dug up his
corpse.  The decomposing (blue, zombie-like) corpse of Elvis Presley is then
unceremoniously dumped on a table at the press conference.  The corpse is then
sent around the country on various money-making schemes.  All this happens in
the first 3 minutes of this film!
     There follows more humor in the same vein.  We see scenes from a new movie
starring the dead Elvis, "Necrophilia, Hawaiian-Style."  There's more to the
film than just the above points, and the ending is grotesque, but extremely
funny.  I will not spoil the film by revealing any more details.
     The basic premise of this film is really sick.  It is a low budget film,
and it looks low budget.  The humor is sophomoric and sick at times.  Now
forget what I just said and go see it!  This is an outrageously funny satire;
one of the funniest short films that I have ever seen!
