Year: 2000. Starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, 
Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant, Christopher Eccleston, 
Vinnie Jones, Scott Caan, Will Patton. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. 
Directed by Dominic Sena. Rated PG-13.
"Gone in Sixty Seconds" is a perfect example of why reviewing films is 
not an exact science. Logically, intellectually, I know it was a bad 
film, one that will probably contribute to the general degradation of 
American cinema as a whole. But on a baser, more primal level, I enjoyed 
it. I could wax philosophical on all the script's problems with 
characterization, or on the utterly ridiculous plotting, or on the sheer 
stupidity of the whole thing, and being a long-winded critic, I probably 
will. But to give it a low rating would render me a hypocrite, because 
when all was said and done, when I had left the theater, I was 
satisfied; I had gotten my money's worth; I liked it. Despite all my 
brain's arrogant attempts to dismiss the film as dim-witted hogwash, my 
gut liked it.
The plot deals with retired car thief Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) and 
his attempt to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from the clutches 
of an evil crime boss (Christopher Eccleston). To do so, Raines must 
steal 50 rare cars in one night. Being an old pro (who had since left 
the "biz" for a legitimate career), Raines recruits a bunch of old 
friends to complete the task. Sound contrived? Of course it's contrived. 
This film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, master of contrived plots. 
He even throws in a brother-brother relationship and an old flame for 
Memphis, a blonde bombshell called Sway. She's played by Angelina Jolie, 
who gets second billing despite barely appearing in half the film. The 
truncated character relationships get their few scenes marked by 
grandiose orchestral swells, but they're unlikely to fool anyone. After 
all, characters don't matter in Bruckheimerland. They are merely props 
to be moved around during high-octane action scenes.
In the past, Bruckheimer has shown a tendency to get carried away with 
the spectacle of his films, attempting to juggle too many characters and 
plot threads. Since he's not much good at anything but action, his most 
overstuffed films ("Armageddon") have played as long, dull excursions 
into shallowness. The best thing, then, about "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is 
that it's refreshingly slimmed down. Yes, there are still too many 
characters, but they're placed very easily on either side of the 
conflict, and the goal is simple: Steal 50 cars. Simplicity is a 
necessity in Bruckheimerland, because you don't want to give anyone a 
chance to stop and observe how little substance there actually is. "Gone 
in Sixty Seconds" moves so fast, there's barely a chance to get bored. 
The car chases (and the second half of the movie is basically one big 
car chase) are filmed professionally and economically by director 
Dominic Sena. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" has everything you'd want from a 
car chase: squealing tires, revving engines, and implausible stunts 
straight out of a demolition derby. It's here the movie works best.
Now, I could complain about how everyone is a racial stereotype in 
Bruckheimerland: Black men are annoying loudmouths, Asian women are bad 
drivers, etc. (Who wrote this script-John Rocker?) Or I could complain 
about the shockingly banal dialogue. ("How bad is it?" "Bad.") And I 
could cite the jaw-droppingly clichE9d conclusion, featuring a fist =
fight in some random steam-filled factory setting, complete with 
slippery guns and supposedly dead characters resurrecting themselves 
with impeccable timing, and proclaim "Gone in Sixty Seconds" to be a 
Very Bad Movie.
But if I did that, I'd be a hypocrite, because I liked this movie more 
than I'd care to admit. No, it's not the least bit original, and yes, it 
is very, very dumb. What I like about "Gone in Sixty Seconds," however, 
is that it never appears to be taking itself terribly seriously. It's 
considerably less pompous than Bruckheimer's last few films, and I enjoy 
trash that knows it's trash a hell of a lot more than trash that 
continually strives to convince you of its seriousness (like, say, 
"Mission: Impossible 2"). I'll take fun, shameless entertainment over 
tedious pretension any day.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     In an ever-changing world, there's something understandably
comforting about the impressive sameness of Jerry Bruckheimer productions. 
Going back to his partnership with the late Don Simpson, Bruckheimer has
built an impressive 15-year resume of box office successes: BEVERLY HILLS
COP, TOP GUN, BAD BOYS, THE ROCK, CON AIR, ENEMY OF THE STATE, ARMAGEDDON. 
There's a formula to his films that has rarely let him down, a formula
that continues with nary a whiff of change in GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. Since
this is a Bruckheimer film, you know you can count on ...
     1) A premise ready-made for action. Nicolas Cage stars as Randall
"Memphis" Raines, once the best "booster" in Southern California, now
retired. He's dragged back into his old trade when his younger brother Kip
(Giovanni Ribisi) screws up while attempting to follow in his footsteps,
leaving nasty crime boss Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) with an
attitude and a job still to be done. In order to save Kip's skin, Memphis
agrees to fulfill Kip's contract: stealing 50 high-end cars. 
Unfortunately, the delivery date is only three days away, leaving Memphis
with little time to put together his crew and scout out the job, all the
while trying to avoid an old law enforcement nemesis (Delroy Lindo) who's
breathing down his neck.
     2) A style that transcends individual directors. It doesn't matter
whether Bruckheimer's flavor of the month is Tony Scott, Michael Bay,
Simon West or SIXTY SECONDS' helmer Dominic Sena -- his films all seem to
look and sound exactly the same. Perhaps it's the fact that Bruckheimer is
attracted to directors whose background (like his) is in commercials and
music videos, making them likely to concur with his vision of glossy
packaging. Maybe he gets his people such great deals on orange lens
filters that it's impossible for those directors not to employ them for
every single shot. Whatever the reason, the quick-cuts, bombastic musical
scoring and burnished glow give Bruckheimer films that certain grandiose
flash that makes for action gold, even if nothing else makes much sense
because of 
     3) Over-stuffed scripts. In his recent efforts, Bruckheimer has shown
a distinct inability to strip down an action story to its essentials. GONE
IN SIXTY SECONDS is no exception, dragging the pacing down by cramming too
many characters into the narrative. That can result in absurd decisions
like creating a solid, vicious villain in Eccleston, then having his
character disappear for literally 80 minutes of the running time, or
similarly wasting the forceful presence of Vinnie Jones (as Memphis' mute,
muscular associate). It also results in conflicts constructed with a
faux-operatic sense of consequence. The family tension between Memphis and
Kip, the non-sparks between Memphis and his old flame/running partner Sway
(Angelina Jolie), even the history between Memphis and Lindo's determined
detective bog the film down with a ridiculous sense that the story should
be taken seriously, when it should be a quick and dirty piece of
crowd-pleasing nonsense. Those decisions are complicated, for better and
worse, by ...
     4) Provocative casting. Bruckheimer has shown himself to be a savvy
packager of talent in recent years, generally teaming up popular stars
with established "serious" actors for a sense of credibility: Tom Cruise
and Robert Duvall in DAYS OF THUNDER, Will Smith and Gene Hackman in ENEMY
OF THE STATE, Cage with Sean Connery in THE ROCK. Cage and Duvall are both
back for GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, as is the characteristically diverse
Bruckheimer supporting cast. Somehow, it does make many of Bruckheimer's
films feel less awful than they should that there are fairly talented
actors involved (Cage's descent into genre nonchalance notwithstanding). 
It also seems even more pathetic when they are stuck with Scott Rosenberg
dialogue like "He's bad  he's real bad." Or, "How deep is he in?" "Deep." 
Or, "I'm not into the life any more." Of course, plenty of viewers will
still lap it all up because it all comes coated in ...
     5) Buckets full of testosterone. Eventually, Bruckheimer films do
move, albeit with a carefully constructed familiarity. The climactic car
chase in SIXTY SECONDS is a competent piece of film work, accentuated by
Sena's fetishistic cross-cutting to brakes and clutches, and a car jump as
aggressively improbable as anything since SPEED. It's simply obvious that
the whole film was constructed around that chase, making me wish the
film-makers could be more honest about their intentions instead of lobbing
a dozen pointless sub-plots at us. Those who have enjoyed most of
Bruckheimer's previous films aren't likely to look disdainfully at this
one, because it goes nowhere different. It's just another over-blown,
sporadically diverting celebration of guy stuff. The names have changed,
but the orange filters remain the same.

Nicholas Cage is Randall "Memphis" Raines, a retired car thief who is
blackmailed back into the business by a really creepy crime ring
leader who will kill Raines' younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi)
because of something he messed up. Raines has to steal 50 cars in a
short amount of time and in order to do he has to round up a gang of
characters that could only be found in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
If you saw "Armageddon" or "Con Air" you can make a lot of assumptions
about this film and be correct.  The difference this time is that the
subject matter is a little more tame, the tone is lighthearted and
fun, it's not so trite and unbelievable. Raines is a nice guy but
technically, he's a criminal, yet we don't want him to be
caught. There's a subplot involving two detectives' efforts to catch
Raines and his gang and amazingly, it works well and is actually
suspenseful and exciting - exactly what a summer movie should be!
Think of as a thriller for the whole family.

GONE IN 60 SECONDS (2000)  *  Directed by Dominic Sena. Written by 
Scott Rosenberg. Photography, Paul Cameron. Editing,  Tom Muldoon and 
Chris Lebenzon.. Production design, Jeff Mann. Music,  Trevor Rabin. 
Cast:   Nicolas Cage (Memphis Raines), Giovanni Ribisi (Kip Raines), 
Angelina Jolie (Sara Wayland), TJ Cross (Mirror Man), William Lee 
Scott (Toby), Scott Caan (Tumbler), James Duval (Freb), Will Patton 
(Atley Jackson), Delroy Lindo (Detective Roland Castlebeck), Robert 
Duvall (Otto Halliwell), Christopher Eccleston (Raymond Calitri), Chi 
McBride (Donny Astricky), Timothy Olyphant (Detective Drycoff), Grace 
Zabriskie (Helen Raines), Master P (Johnny B.), et al. Produced by 
Jerry Bruckheimer and Mike Stenson. Released by Touchstone Pictures. 
119 minutes. PG-13.
Master car thief  Memphis (Nicolas Cage) quit the racket some years 
ago because he did not want his impressionable junior brother  Kip to 
follow in his footsteps (or tire tracks). He is now an honest gas 
station owner (I think) who teaches kids how to race go-karts.  But 
he comes out of retirement when Kip (who, alas, did join the 
underworld), is about to be punished by getting compacted within a 
car at a junk yard. The yard (and more) belongs to master thug 
Calitri (a British import). He is Kip's boss and a caricature of 
demented villainy,  Calitri about to punish Kip with extreme 
prejudice for non-performance of heist duties. He can only be saved 
if senior brother Memphis can steal, pronto, 50 classic cars to be 
shipped abroad.
It's a race against time, with clocks, watches and the countdown 
regularly printed on the screen. Memphis, in record time, assembles a 
regiment of "colorful" gang members, most of them from his old 
organization, many of them having gone straight (it's like an 
epidemic), some of them new faces. And the big heist is on: the 
gathering of the tribes, the planning, the introduction of an able 
cop who will play Nemesis, the complication presented by other 
thieves, the actual execution of the project.
It's all miserably, poorly, incoherently strung together. The 
characters as well as the cars are interchangeable. Nothing is 
elaborated, or at least explained. Heist movies have an educational, 
how-to-do-it function, but here not a single instructional detail is 
delved upon or even vaguely illustrated. The car chases are generic, 
lacking specificity,  and interchangeable. If the projectionist were 
to mix his or her reels it would make no difference, cause no 
problems.
This incoherence contributes a great deal to the film's total lack of 
interest, suspense or even sub-suspense.
Is all this dull? Yes, but the noise can keep you awake and 
especially --in some cases-- your curiosity to see if a car that your 
daddy or your pal Jake's granddaddy once owned (for we're talking 
here about a pre- and low--teens audience, the only one possible) is 
among the "classic" vehicles on the screen.
The film is a sort of remake of the 1974 "Gone in 60 Seconds," the 
first (of two or three movies) made by H.B. Halicki. That was a movie 
of chases and crashes shown in drive-ins and said to have become a 
sort of cult-film in some circles. Halicki produced, wrote, directed, 
starred, did stunts and everything else in his movie. (Does this make 
him an "auteur"?) He died  (1989) in a stunt accident while filming 
the sequel "Gone in 60 Seconds 2." His widow's name appears in the 
end-credits of the remake, as one of the executive producers.
The cast of the current flick is as dull as any, including Angelina 
Jolie who plays (?) the "de rigueur" one gal in the otherwise 
all-male/macho gang. He role is (to quote someone else's film) "Less 
than Zero." Her main function is to pout thick lips and to slow down 
the action.
The director comes from TV commercials (if you haven't guessed this 
already) with one feature to his credit, the actioneer "Kalifornia," 
(1993) which, I am told, has a certain following.
"Gone" is a  Jerry Bruckheimer  production. JB has a record of 
spectacular money-makers, most of them summertime action flicks. 
Among his latest: "Crimson Tide" (1995), "The Rock" (1996), "Con Air" 
(1997), Enemy of the State (1998), "Armageddon" (1999).
Other Bruckheimers coming in the summer of 2000 "Coyote Ugly" and 
"Remember the Titans."   Caveat emptor.

Gone in 60 Seconds is the ultimate guilty pleasure of the summer. It starts 
off as a promising action film, full of genuine suspense and excitement. As 
the movie progresses, it gets increasingly stupid to the point where it's so 
bad and inane that it's good. Throughout the film, the same phony human 
emotion becomes adopted by all the actors, but it's the emotions and 
relationships that keep the film interesting. No character goes beyond wading 
pool level in depth, and that's a very good thing. Director Dominic Sena 
realizes this is an action movie, and he doesn't disappoint. Instead of 
trying to reinvent the genre or use slow motion until it just becomes silly 
(Mission: Impossible 2 anyone?) he takes the best stuff from things we've 
seen before, and makes it into a fun, exciting, and pleasing film.
Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a retired car thief whose younger brother 
Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) attempts to follow in his footsteps. Kip screws up his 
first car heist leading the police right to him and his boss. His boss, an 
evil guy with an English accent, wants Memphis to steal fifty specific cars 
from the Long Beach area in three days. If all the cars don't get delivered 
in time, he will kill Kip. So Memphis and a bunch of his old (now mostly 
clean) car thief buddies work together planning the operation. Some of his 
friends include former girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie), and an auto mechanic 
named Otto (Robert Duvall). Kip and his younger friends also join the crew. 
Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) is about the same age as Memphis, 
and is eager to put him behind bars. Not putting him in jail already is 
something he regrets. Castlebeck and his younger partner Detective Drycoff 
(Timothy Olyphant) pursue Memphis and the gang for most of the film.
One constant element of humor in this movie is the clash between the older 
and younger generations. Memphis and Otto are more cautious about their 
actions and easily spot undercover cops. Unlike some of Kip's pals (including 
Tumbler played by Scott Caan) they are always aware of their surroundings. 
The older guys certainly donât discuss the latest masturbation techniques, or 
steal cars full of heroin. Memphis comes up with inventive ways to evade 
police and gangs, while the youths prefer confrontation. However, one 
hilarious scene does involves one of the older men attacking a bad car 
hijacker claiming he needs to get a role model. If this doesn't sound like 
your type of humor, this movie isn't for you. This movie will please action 
fans, but I think lots of other less action-oriented people may get 
surprised. I certainly was, and apparently the crowd was too. They were 
hooting and hollering and clapped loudly several times. I admire that 
Angelina Jolie doesn't get used as just a sex object in the film. Sway just 
likes hanging with the guys, and not once does she sleep with anyone. While 
the sexual aspect of her character is definitely there, she doesn't appear in 
much of the movie anyway. Nicolas Cage's nasal tone has never been more 
appealing, and I like the range shown by Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.
The action scenes are at the heart of this movie. The mood gets well set; 
everything is dark and grainy. The only constant source of light for the 
characters comes from fiery explosions, car headlights, or police lights. 
There is one skill everyone in the movie possesses; these people can drive. 
During one amazing car chase, Memphis does a spectacular job of navigating 
himself through the streets. The fast pace never stops, and I thought this 
scene to be the highlight of the film. The cast assembled includes some great 
actors who throw almost all their skills away for good old-fashioned movie 
fun. There really don't need to be as many characters as there were. Frances 
Fisher shows up for some reason in the beginning and end, and there were some 
scenes (like giving a dog laxatives so he would "release" the keys he 
swallowed) that don't need to be there.  Regardless, this is still an 
entertaining time. Some Mission: Impossible and James Bond music pops up, and 
similar Bond-esque stunts occur. Gone in 60 Seconds could also promote 
awareness about how easy it is for car thieves to steal your car. It may 
encourage people to be safer about where they park, and security measures 
they use. Coming out of the screening, I got handed a helpful guide with ten 
ways to protect your car from car thieves. 
There are more than eighty people listed under the stunts section of the 
credits. If this doesn't give you an idea about what type of movie this is, I 
don't know what will.

One of my brother's favorite movies is H. B. Halicki's 1974 cult flick "Gone 
is Sixty Seconds," one of the best products of the car-chase genre that 
provided drive-in fare during the 1970's.  Chase pics had more tire squeals 
than dialogue, but they had a strong visceral appeal.  Although it boasts a 
bigger budget and familiar stars, the remake of "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is 
relatively weak and dull.
Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a retired car thief who runs a 
go-cart track.  He got out of crime so that his younger brother Kip (Giovanni 
Ribisi) would not take up boosting cars.  However, Kip became a thief anyway, 
and now he's in big trouble.  Kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports 
cars to gangster Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) by the end of the 
week.  Calitri expects Memphis to fulfill Kip's bargain; if he doesn't come 
through, Kip dies.  Memphis gathers his old crew (Angelina Jolie, Robert 
Duvall, Will Patton, Chi McBride, and Vinnie Jones), and Kip brings his boys 
(T.J. Cross, William Lee Scott, Scott Caan, and James Duval).  As if Calitri 
breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough, the team is pursued by a cop 
(Delroy Lindo) who's still ticked off that he never busted Memphis and by a 
rival gangster (rap star Master P) who wants to take over Calitri's clients.
Watching "Gone," I discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more 
interesting than stealing one.  Maybe that's why the first forty-nine are 
fairly easy, and the thrills are saved for "Eleanor," a 1967 Shelby GTO, a 
model that has always eluded Memphis.  But the big chase doesn't live up to 
the long wait.
I had high hopes for "Gone" because it is director Dominic Sena's second 
film.  "Kalifornia," his 1993 debut, was a brilliant study in the 
relationship between violence and its audience.  In that movie Sena took a 
simple thriller plot (a couple gives a serial killer a ride) and successfully 
endowed it with deeper significance.  In "Gone" he seems to be aiming for a 
drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other, but that goal 
just doesn't mesh with this plot.  
"Gone" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough.  It's not 
light enough to be fun, or mean enough to be intense.  This chaser has more 
dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it.  The lack of action 
is a waste of the premise, which should have challenged the filmmakers to 
create the most spectacular car chases ever.  The weak script is a waste of a 
talented cast.
In a "Newsweek" interview last year, Sean Penn blasted his old pal Nic Cage 
for making bad movies.  Much as I like Cage, for every good picture he does 
("Leaving Las Vegas," "Bringing Out the Dead"), there are two major stinkers 
("Snake Eyes," "Con Air," "8MM," "City of Angels").  That ratio is probably 
better than what a lot of his peers can boast, but Cage has real talent.  
It's a shame to waste it in glitzy, superficial tripe like "Gone in 60 
Seconds."

   This is one of those movies that have the audience
cheering for the thieves to outfox the cops.  Why so?  That
requires us to take a sidetrack back to my college Ethics
class, Philosophy 105.  The instructor posed this problem of
moral ambiguity.  A 21-year-old student, Eddie, has been
doing fine throughout his four years of college except for one
course in music that he was required to take in senior year. 
He never had much of an ear for the masters, but Ed is a
highly ethical person bent on bettering the conditions of
people in the Third World.  He has been accepted for a
two-year stint in the Peace Corps that would require him to
live in a poverty-stricken country on the sort of money earned
by the residents and to teach them scientific agricultural
techniques to better their yearly food crop.  He must be a
college grad to complete his acceptance into this program,
but he has done marginal work in this music class and must
pass the final exam to graduate.  He looks over the test and
knows he cannot cut the mustard, but the fella sitting next to
him is a regular Mozart and Ed has the opportunity to
copy the required answers from his paper.  Considering his
special circumstance, would cheating be the moral thing to
do?
  Cut to producer Jerry Bruckheimer's "Gone in 60
Seconds," based at least loosely on the 1974 movie by H.B.
Halicki--a PG version with a car chase similar to one
climaxing the current work.  Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage),
who dominates the movie, is an ex-car thief, the best, but he
has gone straight--while being watched carefully by Det.
Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) who threatens to put him
away for good if he catches Memphis driving once more
down the wrong path.  But like Eddie the college senior,
Memphis is forced into a situation that requires a choice.  He
could continue following the straight path, coaching a kind of
little-league group of tots who are driving their Coney-Island
type scooters around a track to the cheers of their parents. 
He likes what he's doing.  But now his brother Kip (Giovanni
Ribisi), the fraternal love of his life, is in grave danger. 
Having botched a criminal job for the evil mobster Raymond
Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), Kip is now under a death
threat.  Raymond demands that Memphis steal 50 choice
cars in a period of four days--autos that will be promptly be
exported by ship out of the country--upon which delivery
Memphis will be given $200,000.  If he does not agree, Kip
will be killed.  We all know that the ex-car thief will come to
the right moral decision.
   "Gone in 60 Seconds" spends a good deal of its time in a
climactic chase as the detective, obsessed like a modern
Javert with putting Memphis back behind bars, thinks nothing
of allowing police cars to be totalled as the cop and the thief
soar through California burgs in and around Long Beach. 
Given the generic nature of auto pursuits in movies--and
considering that this one never approaches the excitement of
the race shown by John Frankenheimer in "Ronin"--we look
for something innovative in the Scott Rosenberg's screenplay. 
Now, be aware that Jerry Bruckheimer himself ("The Rock,
"Beverly Hills Cop," "Armageddon," "Top Gun") states in the
production notes that this movie is character driven. 
Bruckheimer?  Character driven? Not a chance.  The gang
that Memphis rounds up to make off with the fifty choice
autos includes a cross-section of stereotypes, including Scott
Caan in a colorless role, TJ Cross and Chi McBride as
unimpressive agents of comic relief, Robert Duvall as the
man behind the scenes who tallies up the cars as they come
in, and Vinnie Jones (the Sphinx) as the only member of
these stooges with anything resembling interest as an
individual.  Angelina Jolie, who gets third billing, does little
except look sexy in a contrived role as a fast-talking car
repair person and tough bartender who teams up all too
suddenly with Memphis after the man dumped her six years
previously.
   Christopher Eccleston is among the wasted persons in the
film.  Playing a vicious mobster with zero tolerance for
jobs not perfectly executed, Eccleston is given not even a
single witty line of the sort that goes to villains and has seen
far far better roles in challenging indies like "Let Him Have It"
and "Jude."  We'd not be surprised to learn, though, that he's
taking a bigger load to the bank for this movie than he did for
all his theater work put together--"A Streetcar Named Desire,"
"Bent" and "Miss Julie" among others.  Robert Duvall, veteran
of incredible capacities in such demanding films as "Sling
Blade" and "The Apostle," must find it unfortunate that the
targeted audience for this actioner may never see what the
man can do.  Giovanni Ribisi knocked out a thunderous role
in the best movie of the year so far, "Boiler Room."  "Gone in
60 Seconds," in fact, might even stimulate some in the
audience to ask about the movie world, "Is that all there is?" 
If they engage the clutch and put their brains into overdrive,
they might even hit the road to find out, in which case a trip
to "Gone in 60 Seconds" will have been worth the effort.

Susan Granger's review of "GONE IN 60 SECONDS" (Touchstone Pictures)
Has your car ever been stolen? Have you ever experienced that
queasy, sinking feeling when you walked to where you left it, only to
find...no car?  That may be why I had a perverse curiosity about this
new Jerry Bruckheimer action/thriller. Written by Scott Rosenberg
("Con Air") and directed by TV-commercial veteran Dominic Sena
("Kalifornia"), it stars Nicolas Cage as "Memphis" Raines, a master
car thief. Back in his heyday, there was no vehicle he couldn't heist
in 60 seconds. He's ostensibly retired until his kid brother Kip,
played by Giovanni Ribisi, is in mortal danger. That brings him back
into the grim world of crime and fear for one last, intense
high-stakes heist. He and his hastily re-assembled gang of seasoned
experts, teamed up with Kip's younger crowd, must steal 50 prized cars
- as Robert Duvall does the tally. Angelina Jolie plays a tough,
Ferrari-loving mechanic who was romantically involved with
Memphis. Delroy Lindo is the L.A. police auto-theft detective who's
determined to arrest Memphis, while Christopher Eccleston is the
vicious villain. The inventive car chases with expert stunt drivers
are amazing, particularly on the bridge linking Long Beach and San
Pedro. Car thieves give their prey girl's names so the mythical star
is "Eleanor," a pewt er 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 with black
stripes. In the original "Gone in 6 0 Seconds" (1974), best known for
its 40-minute chase, Eleanor was a yellow 1973 Mach 1
Mustang. (Remember the green '68 Shelby fastback Steve McQueen d rove
in "Bullitt"?) On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Gone in 60
Secon ds" accelerates to a fast-paced 4. It may push the pedal to the
metal for ca r-and-action aficionados but it left me still wondering
where my stolen car wound up.

Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) has a problem. He was hired by the local crime 
lord, Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), to steal fifty cars. 
Unfortunately, the cops caught him before he finished and impounded the 
cars. Now Calitri is going to kill Kip unless Kip's older brother, Memphis 
(Nicholas Cage), fulfills the contract. Memphis used to be a master car 
thief but retired to keep Kip from following in his brother's footsteps. Now 
Memphis has just three days to steal all fifty cars or his brother will be 
crushed like a tin can. So Memphis goes back and tracks down his old crew, 
which consists of four experienced thieves. Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall) 
is the leader of the group, a feisty old man who has tried to retire and 
lead a straight life. Sway Wayland (Angelina Jolie), Memphis's former lover, 
has gone straight by working herself into the ground at two-full time jobs. 
Atley Jackson (Will Patton) still works as a car thief for Calitri, but his 
loyalties are with Raines. Donny Astricky (Chi McBride) and The Sphinx 
(Vinnie Jones) have obtained regular jobs, but both seem eager to re-enter 
their former life styles. As the group rushes to beat the clock, they are 
being closely followed by detectives Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff 
(Timothy Olyphant). They have a history with Memphis and are waiting to 
catch him in the act of stealing a car so they can put him away for good.
Okay everyone, we all know what to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer ("The 
Rock", "Con Air") movie. We're going to get a weak story, lots of 
explosions, predictable plot twists, and a lot of fun. If you go into "Gone 
in Sixty Seconds" expecting a typical Jerry Bruckheimer movie you should 
have fun. If you expect something deep and dramatic, well, you've obviously 
never seen a Jerry Bruckheimer movie before. His latest outing is as 
mindless as ever, but boy is it entertaining. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is a 
movie packed with car chase after car chase, with very little tying them 
together. The car chases are made amusing by Bruckheimer's desire to keep a 
PG-13 rating attached to the movie. This means that he goes out of his way 
to show that no one gets killed in the chases, no matter how disastrous the 
accidents might be. In one scene a cop car gets smashed through a massive 
concrete wall by a wrecking ball, and the cop climbs out looking slightly 
dazed. I think the other reason for this was because the cops are obviously 
the good guys, and the car thieves, while played like good guys, are 
obviously the villains. Everyone, myself included, would have been in an 
uproar if the cops had been mercilessly slaughtered while we were supposed 
to be cheering for their killers.
With the exception of "The Rock" and possibly "Enemy of the State", most 
Bruckheimer movies aren't known for featuring great actors. "Gone in Sixty 
Seconds" is a delightful exception to that rule. While Nicholas Cage acts 
like Nicholas Cage (as always), he occasionally shows some (gasp) emotion. I 
think this is because Cage's passion in life is cars, and he was now given 
the chance to make a movie about them. He looks like a little boy in a candy 
store through most of the film. While I may not like Nicholas Cage, I like 
nearly every member of his supporting cast. Will Patton ("Entrapment", 
"Armageddon"), who was one of the best actors in "Armageddon" shines once 
again. Robert Duvall ("A Civil Action") can't help but be good in everything 
he appears in, and he sticks to that trend here. The other stand-out actor 
is Delroy Lindo ("Romeo Must Die"), who seems to be making a name for 
himself. Lindo has quite a talent for snapping back and forth from looking 
angry to looking calm and collected with believability. The two most unusual 
casting choices were Angelina Jolie ("Girl Interrupted") and Timothy 
Olyphant ("Go"). Angelina Jolie was an odd choice because, contrary to what 
the previews would have you believe, she plays little more than a bit part. 
This was a waste of one of todays most talented actresses. Timothy Olyphant, 
who was great as the slightly off-kilter drug dealer in "Go", is given 
nothing to do in "Gone in Sixty Seconds". His character serves no purpose 
other than to follow Delroy Lindo about and make not-so-smart-alec comments.
A common trait amongst Bruckheimer films has always been the strangely 
frantic editing. It doesn't seem to matter who directs, Michael Bay 
("Armageddon"), Simon West ("Con Air"), or Dominic Sena, Bruckheimer must 
set the style in advance. Dominic Sena's only sense of style seems to be to 
film chase scenes at night in unlit areas so we can't tell who is chasing 
who. Bay did something similar in "Armageddon" on the asteroid, but at least 
it made some sense there. I have only one other major complaint with "Gone 
in Sixty Seconds", but it's a very big complaint. This is a movie filled 
with interesting and bizarre characters, but they're all given next to no 
screen time. Vinnie Jones' ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") character 
of The Sphinx is possibly the most unusual, being an apparently mute 
mortician who walks through punches and explosions without a scratch. He 
also seems the most eager to kill and maim things, but he's never given the 
chance since he shows up in only four or five scenes. The other interesting 
character is Patton's, who seems to be the mediator of the group, and has a 
history of some sort with all the other characters. Unfortunately his past 
is never gone into, and we still know nothing about him by the end of the 
film. Okay, I'm done complaining. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" boasts two things 
which put all my complaints to rest. One is the best car chases this side of 
"Ronin"; the other is a terrific soundtrack which features classic songs 
like "The Lowrider" combined with yet another great score from composer 
Trevor Rabin ("Armageddon"). Like all Bruckheimer films, this one runs too 
long at 117 minutes. I'd recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed his previous 
films and to anyone who enjoyed "Ronin" for its car chases. I give it a well 
earned three and a half out of five stars.

     Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, in a philanthropic moment, bought the 
rights to a grade C 1974 quickie called Gone In 60 Seconds, which was 
made by a guy named H.B. Halicki and is remembered, if it is remembered 
at all, for a 40-minute car chase.  Halicki himself was gone in short 
order, erased in an accident while filming a sequel. 
     Both movies involve stealing a lot of cars, and driving recklessly 
and very fast.  A less sensitive man than Bruckheimer might not have 
felt this was worth paying the big bucks for, but Jerry's the man who 
brought us The Rock and Armageddon, so he has certain standards to 
maintain. 
     Bruckheimer veteran Nic Cage is the central character, an ex-car 
thief known even to his family as Memphis.  Cage once won a Best Actor 
Oscar, but he's been trying successfully to live it down ever since.  
Memphis is going straight, working at a go-kart track with little kids, 
but his brother (Giovanni Ribisi) has run afoul of a homicidal crime 
boss (Christopher Eccleston), and Memphis has to heist 50 high-end autos 
in a night to save the lad's bacon. 
     Gone In 60 Seconds  is all speed and shiny surfaces, with odd 
little moments of pathos spotted in to support Bruckheimer's assertion 
that this movie is "character driven".   Driven, yes; character, no.
     I could tell you how Memphis puts together a "team", and mention 
names like Robert Duvall, but that would give you false hope.  I could 
mention Delroy Lindo, reduced here to an Inspector Javert-like detective 
who grouses "I should have put you away when I had the chance," sounding 
like George Bush bitching to Saddam Hussein.   I could mention Angelina 
Jolie, yet another Oscar winner, but that would give you the impression 
that there's a female presence here.  I couldn't figure for the life of 
me what Jolie was doing in the movie, except to ponder with Cage the 
question "Which is better, boosting cars or sex?"
     The answer is neither, when it becomes as monotonously repetitive 
as it does here.  Boosting one car could be pretty exciting.  Boosting 
50 is just plain tedious.  It's like one of those tours that takes you 
to 12 European cities in 6 days. 
     If all you ask for in a movie is lots of car chases, you'll find 
plenty of that in this one.  Memphis's main automotive squeeze is a '67 
Shelby Mustang GT 500 (similar to the car  Steve McQueen drove in 
Bullitt.)  Her name is Eleanor, and he comes a lot closer to orgasm with 
her than he does with Angelina Jolie.

_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Given the presence of Angelina Jolie--and how prominent her presence is
in the film's advertising campaign--one would be led to believe that
_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ is the first Jerry Bruckheimer-produced actioner
with a strong female presence.  With Jolie, a wild child who is just as
ballsy, if not more, than any male counterpart, Bruckheimer has a female
star that he could run with.  If only he could see it that way.
No, not even the force of nature that is Angelina can combat the rampant
testosterone in _Sixty_, a reworking of the 1974 film of the same name. 
But that is but one way the film is typical Bruckheimer.  There are all
the glossy visuals and stylish cutting; there are the awkwardly forced
moments of "emotion"; there is a pumped-up soundtrack scoring accordingly
amped-up action scenes; there is a talented cast that is wildly
overqualified to do this type of popcorn fodder.  This time around,
however, the surface thrills that it does deliver aren't quite enough.
Nicolas Cage stars as Randall "Memphis" Raines, a reformed car thief who
is forced back into action when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi)
runs afoul of the evil car thief Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston).
 In order to spare Kip's life, Memphis must steal 50 cars within 72
hours.
Of course, Memphis and his crew don't strike until the the last night,
so we can have the familiar race against time finale.  As such,
_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ doesn't start to deliver the anticipated action
until well into the third act.  While director Dominic Sena ably shoots
and stages it with all the heavy style that one associates with a
Bruckheimer production, the climactic car chase cannot erase the memory
of the draggy and often tedious two acts that precede the mayhem.
The audience's interest is supposed to be held by two things during the
film's first acts.  First is the obligatory group of eccentric supporting
players.  Among Memphis' partners in grand theft auto are mentor Otto
(Robert Duvall); former partner Atley (Will Patton); wisecracking buddy
Donny (Chi McBride); silent muscleman the Sphinx (Vinnie Jones); ex-flame
Sara, a.k.a. "Sway" (Jolie, in an absolute throwaway of a role); and
Kip's gang of young techies and lunkheads (Scott Caan, James Duval, TJ
Cross, and William Lee Scott).  This is indeed a quirky bunch, but not
necessarily a colorful one.  Aside from McBride (who has some good
lines), Duvall (still a commanding presence), and Jolie (alluring eye
candy), the group is uninteresting at best and annoying at worst.
Second, one is supposed to be engaged by the purported emotional
connections between the characters.  Kip only wants to be accepted and
respected by his brother; Memphis wants to prove to Sway that his leaving
her was for the best.  But anyone who's seen a Bruckheimer knows that
pyrotechnics are his strong suit, not quiet moments--and when they do
come, they are laughably heavy-handed and jarring (witness, for example,
the conclusions of _Con_Air_ and _Armageddon_).  Sena and writer Scott
Rosenberg don't do anything to change that track record; if possible,
he's managed to carve a new low with the jaw-droppingly maudlin final
encounter between Memphis and the cop (Delroy Lindo, great even in this
ridiculous context) who's chasing him.
Somehow, however, I get the feeling that real problems such as these
will be lost on the casual viewer.  The screening I attended was
sweetened with non-press people, and I overheard many of them raving
about the film afterward; one even said, "I haven't been this entertained
by a film in a long time."  Either that guy doesn't get out much, or
(more likely) _Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ will be another summer success for
Bruckheimer--actual quality be damned.

Have you ever been driving on an empty, open road and had the sudden urge to 
put the pedal to the metal, not just to see how fast you could go, but for 
the pure adrenaline rush? Driving far past the speed limit may be illegal, 
and potentially dangerous, but that risk just aids in the sense of freedom 
you unavoidably obtain. Dominic Sena's "Gone in 60 Seconds," based on a cult 
1974 film of the same name (famous for a showstopping 40-minute car chase 
sequence), is the latest brain(less)child of producer Jerry Bruckheimer 
(1997's "Con Air," 1998's "Armageddon")--someone who knows how to make a 
movie fast-paced, and how to orchestrate overblown action setpieces--and it 
should have been the film to reinforce the idea of letting go of your 
inhibitions and driving fast every now and again. Walking out of the theater, 
director Sena (in his feature film debut after making many flashy television 
commercials) and Bruckheimer, no doubt, want the audience to get such an 
urge, but they fail miserably, even on the elementary level of creating 
excitement.
For six years, Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) has been retired from his former 
car thief business, and has taken up a job as a kiddie Go-Kart operator 
somewhere in the Nevada desert. When he receives word that his younger 
brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), has since picked up the trade and landed 
himself in hot water with crime boss Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), 
Memphis flees back to San Francisco to save him. Raymond gives Memphis an 
ultimatum: steal fifty assigned cars in four days, or Kip has to pay the 
consequences. Predictably, a ragtag group of reformed car thieves and Kip's 
friends are assembled to help Memphis in his quest, none of which have more 
than one or two defining characteristics. He is also reunited with his 
dreadlocked ex-lover, Sway (Angelina Jolie), who looks as if she just 
returned from her "Battlefield Earth" audition. Meanwhile, two detectives 
(Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant) are hot on Memphis' trail.
Several months ago, when the trailer for "Gone in 60 Seconds" began 
advertising, one woman behind me in the theater, following the preview, 
exclaimed, "I'm exhausted just watching that!" To be sure, the film looked as 
if it was sure to be a balls-to-the-wall, no-holds-barred summer action 
picture. The aforementioned lady in the theater needn't have fretted about 
the aspects of possibly seeing "Gone in 60 Seconds," because the trailer is 
infinitely more thrilling than the actual movie, which has all of about two 
or three action scenes strung out over the course of two hours, with 
nonsensical, time-filling rubbish in between. In pure Jerry Bruckheimer 
fashion, character-building moments mean 30-second dialogue exchanges 
overpopulated with corny one-liners. In pure Jerry Bruckheimer fashion, every 
shot has been given a yellowish tint by cinematographer Paul Cameron, as if a 
filter has been strategically placed over the camera to portray the world as 
naturally looking like a golden palace.
However, what is not in pure Jerry Bruckheimer fashion is the film's slow 
pace and wearisomely dull action scenes--all two or three of them.
Nicolas Cage can be--no, strike that--is a brilliant actor, so why he 
continues to make great films (i.e. 1995's "Leaving Las Vegas," 1999's 
"Bringing Out the Dead"), followed by insipid ones (1997's "Con Air," 1998's 
"Snake Eyes"), is a question only he could be able to answer. His talent is 
genuine, and his face has a wonderful, soulful quality that allows him to 
"say" a great deal when given the chance. Life is too short to be wasting his 
time in throwaway roles that give him nothing to do, except cash a fat 
paycheck.
The top-to-bottom talent that "Gone in 60 Seconds" exudes is amazing all the 
same, none of which have any reason at all to appear here. Fresh off her 
Academy Award winning performance in "Girl, Interrupted," Angelina Jolie is 
second-billed, but appears for all of about fifteen minutes (if that) in an 
underutilized role that not only wastes her, but causes you to almost forget 
how good she can be in other movies. As the snappily-named Sway, Jolie 
sleepwalks through her fleeting scenes as if she is attempting to blend into 
the background and not be discovered as an actual performer involved in such 
a bottomless pit. 
As younger brother Kip, Giovanni Ribisi is appropriately scummy-looking and 
slimy, but one wonders why Memphis would go through so much trouble to save 
such an ungrateful prick. Until checking over the cast list following viewing 
the movie, I had almost forgotten Robert Duvall was in it, which gives you an 
idea of how much of an impression he makes. Especially distressing are the 
young rising stars that appear for very little rhyme or reason, including 
James Duval (1995's "The Doom Generation"), Scott Caan (1999's "Boiler 
Room"), and Timothy Olyphant (1999's "Go"). The only actor that escapes 
relatively unscathed is Delroy Lindo, as Detective Roland Castlebeck, who 
brings a certain charm and, dare I say, depth to his scenes that are missing 
elsewhere.
The opening 100 minutes are nothing more than setup for the climactic car 
chase, but instead of breathtakingly going down as one of the classic chase 
sequences, along with 1971's "The French Connection" and 1998's "Ronin", Sena 
botches everything by haphazard editing that robotically switches back and 
forth between the pedal, Cage's face, and an overview shot of the car. But, 
considering the disposability of what came before, it should have been 
expected. The underwhelming finale simply proved what I had increasingly been 
realizing throughout, which is that there was no reason for "Gone in 60 
Seconds" to be made at all.

This is a note to the marketing execs of this film. 
Stop promoting it by taking out television and
newspaper ads.  Instead, concentrate your advertising
dollars in such magazines as Car & Driver, Motor
Trend, or Hot Rod.  "Gone in 60 Seconds" is the kind
of film to which car enthusiasts will flock. 
Featuring a bevy of exotic cars and high performance
vehicles, it gives you a chance to see seldom seen
top-of-the line cars that you could only dream of
owning.  However, to the rest of us non-enthusiasts,
which is about 98% of us, this is a film that is need
of a tune-up.  Its cars move faster than the story and
their sleek looks are more memorable than any of the
characters.
The film would have you believe that it stars Nicolas
Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi.  But its
real stars are the Porsches, Ferraris and
Lamborghinis.  And there are plenty of them.  An auto
theft ring led by Kip Raines (Ribisi) is targeting
these beauties and a few other specialty cars.  Kip
has been hired by a local crime boss who is not the
kind of man that believes in mercy or forgiveness. 
Kip feels up to the task and accepts the difficult
job.  However, he's young, brash, and lacks the
experience to pull off such a hefty assignment. 
Eventually, one of his 'boosts' goes awry.  The police
discover and confiscate Kip's stolen cars.  Although
he eludes the police, he still must answer to the
crime boss, who promises Kip an agonizing death unless
he can deliver.
Nicolas Cage plays Kip's older brother, Memphis, who
was a legendary car thief in his own time.  Now, he
makes an honest living, but is forced back into a life
of crime in order to save his brother.  Memphis must
steal 50 cars in 4 days; otherwise his brother will be
killed.  He quickly begins to assemble his team.  They
include, among others, trusted friend (Robert Duvall),
and former love interest Sway (Angelina Jolie).  They
do some homework to locate the needed cars and they
ready themselves for a one-night blitz where they hope
to pull off a daring string of auto thefts.
For Memphis and his crew, stealing cars is like taking
candy from a baby.  They easily open locks, hot wire
ignitions, disarm alarms, bypass circuitry and remove
other theft-deterrent devices with surprising ease. 
However, Memphis still must contend with some serious
issues if he is to succeed.  A dogged detective
(Delroy Lindo) knows that he's up to no good and has
deployed surveillance teams out to watch over several
of the vehicles targeted for theft.  Competing car
thieves who do not welcome Memphis's reappearance want
him to leave town.  And, to be able to make the
deadline, all of the thefts would have to go smoothly,
which is virtually impossible.
The only fun part of the film occurs in the last 25
minutes as Memphis races against time and a squadron
of police cars to deliver the last car.  This is
actually an impressively designed chase sequence,
taking us through congested city streets and a
construction zone where our hero has to dodge various
debris and even a wrecking ball.  But "Gone in 60
Seconds" is remarkably slow for a film that seems like
it will showcase lots of chase sequences and the
charisma reminiscent of "Smokey and the Bandit." 
Sadly, with its goofy and underwhelming
characterizations, this film starts to feel more like
"The Dukes of Hazzard."

Directed by Dominic Sena. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. Starring Nicolas 
Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo. Running time: 121 minutes. Rated AA 
by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 11th, 2000.
Movies like "Gone In 60 Seconds" boggle my mind. Here we have a cast of 
Academy Award-winning actors. We have a scenario that promises lots of 
high-octane action and excitement. We have a screenplay written by Scott 
Rosenberg, who penned the entertaining "Con Air". We have that film's 
producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who has also overseen such thrilling fare as 
"The Rock", "Crimson Tide" and "Beverly Hills Cop" (although, it should 
be noted, also masterminded that most gratuitous waste of celluloid, 
"Armageddon"). And yet despite these promising ingredients, we have a 
movie that just doesn't deliver. "Gone In 60 Seconds" feels like it can 
barely get out of neutral, let alone shift into high gear.
Nicolas Cage plays "Memphis" Raines, formerly California's best car thief 
and now retired to run a gas station and go-kart track. Unbeknownst to 
Memphis, his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) has followed in his footsteps 
and is trying to make his own name boosting autos. But Kip messes up one 
night while on the job for Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), who 
took over when Memphis left town. Contacting Memphis, Calitri informs him 
that he needs to steal fifty rare cars in the space of four days, or Kip 
will be killed.
Reluctantly agreeing to reenter his old profession, Memphis starts 
getting back in touch with members of his old gang, including mentor Otto 
(Robert Duvall) and ex-girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie); Kip brings along 
his own young accomplices to fill out the ranks. But by the time the team 
has been assembled and the reconnaissance carried out, only twenty-four 
hours remain before Calitri's deadline, forcing Memphis and his friends 
to boost the fifty cars in a single night. And to add to their troubles, 
they must contend with veteran cop Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo), who
missed his chance to nab Memphis once, and does not intend to let it pass 
him by again.
"Gone In 60 Seconds" is based loosely on the popular 1974 drive-in 
feature by HB Halicki, and I headed into the theatre expecting one of 
those movies which sacrificed plot and characterisation in favour of 
relentless excitement. I was half right: there's not much plot and not 
much characterisation, but it takes an hour and a half before the film 
even starts trying to get the adrenalin pumping.
The big problem with the movie is that it feels like it was made from the 
first draft of the script rather than the final version. Rosenberg's 
storytelling is extremely clumsy. After a mildly entertaining opening 
bit, we are sucked into a dull and overlong middle section in which 
Memphis brings together his team, checks out the cars, and reencounters 
old sparring partner Castlebeck. Not only is all this extremely tedious, 
it feels almost unnecessary. Rosenberg is obviously trying to give each 
of the players a distinctive personality but lacks the skill to do so, 
and would have been better off spotlighting just a handful. The result is
that Memphis' team consists of a dozen people all with minimal 
characterisation, and none of whom we end up caring very much about.
This is particularly unfortunate because it means that some very talented 
actors like Duvall, Ribisi and Jolie are pretty much wasted in roles that 
struggle for screen time. Duvall, for example, is consigned to standing 
around a warehouse most of the time. Jolie appears just long enough to 
remind us of the tremendous charisma she brings to any role, and make us 
wish her part was more significant. Eccleston, as the malevolent Calitri, 
seems like he could have been a delightfully cartoonish sort of villain, 
but appears only briefly, in the film's first and last half hours. Cage, 
meanwhile, seems to be on autopilot as Memphis; he does what he can with 
the paltry material, but there is no real enthusiasm to the performance. 
Cage lowers himself to the standards of the script, rather than trying to 
bring it up to his own level.
Examples of these low standards litter "Gone In 60 Seconds". There are 
some sequences which are so contrived, and feel so obviously shoehorned 
into the plot, that I found myself shaking my head in the theatre. For 
example, late in the film, one of Kip's friends -- a computer wizard who 
usually stays behind a laptop rather than heading out into the field -- 
suddenly demands to go on a heist. That he nearly screws everything up 
should come as a surprise to no one. Rosenberg's dialogue also verges on 
the excruciating at several points; Calitri is described as coming after 
Kip "like stains on a mattress", for instance.
"Gone In 60 Seconds" finally gets moving when after an hour and a half -- 
gasp, shock -- we finally get some car chases. These are undeniably 
engrossing, although I was disappointed that they weren't a little more 
inventive. Certainly, they are inferior to such memorable chase sequences 
as, say, Gene Hackman's in "The French Connection". They are also 
somewhat hamstrung by Dominic Sena's otherwise competent direction. More 
than once, Sena is unable to keep the depiction of the car chases fluid 
and coherent, and this difficulty in following the action works against 
its entertainment value.
But perhaps the worst thing that can be said about the car chases is that 
they lead up to the film's routine, lacklustre and faintly ludicrous 
conclusion. It is here that the laziness of Rosenberg's script is most 
evident, giving us an ending which not only steals from every other 
B-grade action movie, but also totally dismisses one of his principals' 
established characterisation.
As mindless summer entertainment, "Gone In 60 Seconds" isn't bad, but 
even the most avid action fan is likely to be turned off by the movie's 
lethargic pacing. Compared to the film's two hour running time, the 
twenty minutes or so of car chases seems paltry, given that the 
anticipation of these scenes is the movie's main selling point. "Gone In 
60 Seconds" will make you wish you'd been gone from the theatre in a lot 
less than 119 minutes.

Review by Scott Hunt
Movie Hunt: http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html
The stereotypical American male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports 
cars. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so 
loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic 
shot of powerful muscle cars, sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed 
machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze. Gone is 
60 Seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry.
Cage is legendary retired car thief, Memphis Raines (don't you love cute 
movie names), who must call upon his time worn skills to save his 
thick-headed brother (Ribisi) from being killed. Seems a murderous crime 
boss (Eccleston) with a fetish for wood (insert your own joke) hired brother 
Kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive, exotic autos. Fifty cars, to 
be exact. Poor Kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly. If the cars 
aren't delivered in three days, bossman has a casket carved out just for 
Kip. Literally. If only someone could save him. Hmmmm..wonder what Memphis 
is doing?
In order to give the film some emotional heft, there are several subplots 
designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of...yawn, excuse 
me, dramatic tension. Shadowing Memphis is an old law enforcement foe 
(Lindo) who's looking to send Memphis away. Will he catch him? There's old 
flame Sway (Jolie), who had her heart broken by Memphis years ago. Will they 
get back together? Shortsighted, thrill seeker Kip idolizes his brother, yet 
resents him for moving away from the family. Will they reconnect? Raines old 
mentor (Duvall) has long since left the life of crime. Will Memphis get him 
finally caught as he pulls him back into the life, one more time? Can you 
answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film 
first? I'll bet you can.
Following the opening credits, which fill you in on the accomplishments of 
the Raines family through a montage of old photos, we was taken full 
throttle into the splendor that is Memphis. He's first shown living the good 
life teaching young children to drive go-carts. In a later scene, as misfit 
brother Kip knowingly tells Memphis he has the stolen car situation under 
control, all the while making breakfast, a metaphor is made of Shakespearean 
proportions. Just as a pan of grease flares up with Kip clueless to how to 
quell it, big brother Memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it. 
Looks like everything might turn out alright after all. You know this 
because the music swells on the crest of violins.
That's about as strong as the characterization gets, which is a shame. 
Bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount 
of talent given the task at hand.  Monumentally underused Jolie portrays an 
empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and Memphis. Or 
maybe it's just the cars. Duvall trots out his ornery, but sweet old codger 
outfit. I'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one. 
Lindo projects a warm hearted, but tightly focused detective that almost 
transcends the material. The biggest waste of resources is Vinnie Jones, who 
plays a mute accomplice of Memphis. Without saying a word, he is easily the 
most charismatic person in the movie. Like a blast of nitrous oxide, he 
attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal. Too bad his minutes onscreen 
are so few. Somehow, Bruckheimer manages to attract top Hollywood acting 
talent to high concept, poorly written movies, gussies up the film with lots 
of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial 
hotcakes.
Every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so 
overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie. 
There's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty 
to a part of the plot. It's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt 
at humor by having an Asian American repeatedly failing a driver's test. 
Imagine the yuks. There's a segment where one of the thieves shows another 
his cool fake fingerprint trick. It's countered by the lame semi-subplot of 
a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk. The ramifications 
are never explored. Then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who 
actually shoot at fleeing cars. Not only is it stupid, but it's against the 
law.
This is a movie made of pretty, but tepid car chases strung together by just 
enough character interaction to move the plot along. Gone in 60 Seconds 
aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining, but 
empty film to leave your memory.

GONE IN 60 SECONDS (director: Dominic Sena; screenwriter: Scott

Raines), Angelina Jolie (Sara Wayland), TJ Cross (Mirror Man), William

I should have been so lucky to have been gone from the theater in 60
seconds; but, I sat through this two hour remake of the slender film
"Gone" (1974), an original film that was so shallow, everything else
seen that year must have seemed deep by comparison. It's hard to get
lower in moral decrepitude than this car current booster film. This was
not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one. This is a Jerry
Bruckheimer productions, which has come to stand for mediocrity in
artistic value but for success in the box office, which will probably
mirror how this film does, though it is a little worst artistically
speaking than his other mediocre films, as if that will supposedly
matter to its target audience.
To make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense, a
stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing, instead some
gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's
name. Everything about the story was kept hyper, as mindless violence
won out over gratuitous sex, to become the major selling point of this
exploitive film. Though, the real star of the film, is that climactic
car chase at the final scene, with Cage outracing the police in his
stolen 1967 Shelby GT Mustang, speeding through the downtown streets and
freeway in Los Angeles.
The action begins right from the opening credits. A Porsche is stolen
out of a car showroom in Southern California and the police follow the
speeding car right to its point of destination, a garage, where there
are a number of other high-end cars stolen, waiting to be shipped to its
new illegitimate owner in a matter of days. Nicolas Cage stars as
Randall "Memphis" Raines, once the best "booster" in the world, but now
retired. What brings him back into the car theft business, is that his
arrogant younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) fouls up the delivery
dates for the cars, as the cops impound all the cars they find at the
garage he led them to. The malicious crime boss Raymond Calitri
(Christopher Eccleston) tells Memphis, in order to save Kip's ass from
being expunged from the human race, he must steal the specific list he
gives him of 50 high-scaled rare cars Ray promised his client he was to
deliver to him in four days. It is incredulous that Memphis falls for
such an offer from such an untrustworthy mobster, especially since there
were so many other options for him to take that were less risky, and not
the least of the options, would be going to a lawyer and copping a plea
bargain deal for his brother with the district attorney.
But Cage accepts this ludicrous challenge to save his brother by
stealing these cars and returns home to Long Beach to tell his
long-suffering mother, that he has to renege on his promise to her to
never go back to stealing cars, because this is the only way he can save
Kip. He then goes to his old pal Robert Duvall, who runs a vintage body
shop. Duvall was once part of Cage's car ring, and he helps Cage put
together the crew he needs to pull off the heist.
Cage also must avoid a detective (Delroy Lindo) who knows he has
something to do with those cars stolen through his informants and puts
him under surveillance. The thrill of the film now becomes in watching
the crew be selected, which includes Angelina Jolie, Chi McBride, James
Duval, and Scott Caan, none of whom are in the least bit interesting or
funny. Jolie seems to disappear for most of the film, only to reappear
much later in the film and mumble a few inconsequential lines. The
enlisted crew give their reason for not joining Cage's caper, saying
they are clean now or some jump head-first into this project, but
whatever, they all join in this stupid venture. No one seems to be
concerned that they are doing something that is criminal.
There's also a car thief rival of Cage's, played by Master P, I think
he's a rapper when he's not in high-class films like this one. He gets
into a feud with Cage, believing that Cage got the contract from Ray
that was meant for him.
There's basically no story or dialogue, the action is all packaged like
commercials are with
gloss and trick shots, colored filters, fast-paced editing, and all the
other tricks of the trade the directors for Jerry Bruckheimer use to
sell the action sequences. Everything about this film seemed ridiculous.
Its logic for being could be taken apart at any point of the film. But
the ending, after the car chase, was what finally got my craw. The moral
bankruptcy it presented, that Lindo would just let Cage and his crew off
the hook for all the thefts, was too much to comprehend. It was so weak
to hear Lindo say to Cage, "Well, you saved my life, and I guess it was
a brotherly thing you did for your brother, so I'm going to let you go,
now get out of here before I change my mind." If I had my wish, Lindo
should go to jail for failing to do his job. The director should go to
work in Duvall's body shop and never direct another film. And, this
senseless macho film should die a slow death at the box office, so films
like this would become extinct like dinosaurs. I should be so lucky... .

Director Dominic Sena (who made the highly underrated Kalifornia) and
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock, Armageddon) bring us a slick and
entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no
one has ever seen.  
Nicolas Cage plays Memphis, a retired car thief who's "pulled back in"
to the business by an evil car thief overlord (Christopher Eccleston)
determined to kill Memphis' kid brother (Giovanni Ribisi).  Memphis is
ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an
unfortunate demise, all while having to elude the detectives hot on his
trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to
him and his gang.  Memphis sets out to put his old crew back together,
but discovers that most of them have retired as well. 
Gone in Sixty Seconds does things right from the opening credits.  In
that sequence, we get a rockin' little tune from Moby, along with some
simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects. 
Filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening
title sequence, and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an
entertaining ride.  And what follows doesn't disappoint... 
Cage turns in one of his good performances here (he can easily go either
way... good or bad... I don't know how he does that), and his mannerisms
and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely.  Of the supporting
cast members, Angelina Jolie as Memphis' former love is in the film just
to provide eye candy (she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey
I've ever seen) and Robert Duvall as Memphis' former mentor is just
around to lend the film some class.  Also, I'm a big fan of Will Patton
(Armageddon, The Postman) and would love to see him get a huge role
someday.  None of these three performers are given much to do
unfortunately. 
Some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles. 
Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit
of Memphis, as does Timothy Olyphant (Go) as Lindo's partner.  I just
wish some of the other characters could have been as important. 
The only real gripe I have about the film though is its conclusion...
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even
roll.  There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be
successfully stolen, and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good
opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "rival car
thief" plot line.  As it stands, that story line is wrapped up about
halfway through the film in a tidy little package.  But if I was making
this film, I'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before
Memphis and his crew, thereby making Memphis have to improvise...
thereby adding some meat to the plot. 
The finale is essentially just a big car chase, and there just aren't
ways to make car chases interesting anymore.  It's all been done.  The
chase is also shot and edited in that "Jerry Bruckheimer Action
Sequence" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what
specifically is going on in the scene.  Sure it's a car chase, but what
exactly are the particulars of it?  It's very hard to tell.  Finally,
there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the
"bus jumping the ramp" sequence from Speed in the "Oh, I don't think
so..." department. 
Despite those minor complaints, Gone in Sixty Seconds is pure summer
movie entertainment.  It's not thought provoking, but it's shiny, loud
and fun... just what a summer flick should be.  [PG-13]

 Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Nicolas Cage,
Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Will
Patton and Vinnie Jones. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. Directed by
Dominic Sena. Rated PG-13.
 I was not looking forward to Gone in 60 Seconds. I was expecting an
overblown multimillion stunt extravaganza featuring non-stop, repetitive
car chases, crashes and explosions.
 I turned out to be a bit off center. Gone in 60 Seconds is one of those
movies for which you buy a bucket of popcorn, put your brain in neutral,
sit back and enjoy the ride.
 The movie is a noisy bit of entertainment with a surprising touch of
characterization to boot. Itís nothing more than preposterous fun.
 Borrowing only the basics from the 1974 original that was a Southern
drive-in favorite of that era along with such titles as Eat My Dust and
Grand Theft Auto, Gone in 60 Seconds centers on a gang of car thieves
headed by Randall ěMemphisî Raines (Nicolas Cage).
 ěMemphisî had quit the business six years earlier and fled Los Angeles,
But he is forced to take up his old career after his brother, Kip
(Giovanni Ribisi), is jammed up by a big-time operator who threatens to
kill him unless his order of 50 exotic cars is met.
 ěMemphisî has four days to gather up his old crew, plan and execute the
thefts.
 Considering the title and its origins, there is not as much activity as
youíd expect in Gone in 60 Seconds.
 While the centerpiece of the original was a 40-minute chase, there are
relatively few action pieces in this remake. Most of the film deals with
the planning of the various heists, plus the interaction of the
characters.
 Which is not to say that Gone in 60 Seconds is all talk and no
movement. The car chase finale is an exciting sequence of stunt driving
by all involved. Smartly, the filmmakers build to this muscle-vehicle
finale.
 The glue of the film is its cast. Cage is likable as the reluctant
ěMemphis,î forced back into a life he was happy to abandon, while Ribisi
is the resentful, bitter younger brother who feels abandoned by his
legendary sibling.
 Others in the cast include Robert Duvall as an old-time carjacker; Will
Patton as a tough, but honorable former colleague of ěMemphisî; and a
dreadlocked Angelina Jolie as ěSway,î the former girlfriend and member
of the ěMemphisî crew.
 Also worth noticing is Vinnie Jones as Sphinx, the silent member of the
gang. He is compelling to watch without saying a word.
 Delroy Lindo is straight and stalwart as the police detective out to
nab the gang.
 The movieís score by Trevor Rabin at times is a bit too pounding and
overwrought.
 The too-good-to-believe finale is, of course, totally illogical, but,
by then you donít mind. After all, this is fantasy, not a documentary.
 Those expecting 100 minutes of high-speed driving, grinding metal and
fireballs may be a tad disappointed by Gone in 60 Seconds. It's not a
big-screen version of Foxís ěScariest Police Chasesî series.
 Gone in 60 Seconds is merely a good-time, fast-track feature. Merely
take it at face value ó and donít forget to buckle up.

The Entertainment Weekly magazine movie critic who reviewed this film called
THE ROCK ("big and half dumb"), CON AIR ("huge and moronic"), and ARMAGEDDON
("colossal and brain-dead"). Now those three films combined to gross a
little less than half a billion dollars domestically, so my guess is that
there were actually a few people out there who did appreciate the films on a
certain level. This has always been my main complaint about so-called real
"movie critics". Why review films which obviously don't appeal to your
sensibilities? Get another critic who appreciates certain aspects of that
genre to check it out instead. Phew! Okay...rant over. And oh yeah, the
critic in question gave this film a "D". Duh! Didn't see that one comin'.
PLOT:
A retired car thief is blackmailed back into stealing cool cars when his
little brother's life is threatened by a mean, ol' car thief ring operator.
The older brother basically has 24 hours to steal 50 specific high-priced
automobiles or his little brother bites the dust. Simple enough?
CRITIQUE:
A below-par Bruckheimer film which does satisfy with a couple of cool chase
scenes, a semi-interesting tale and car-stealing scenarios, but ultimately
doesn't blow you away with anything. I enjoyed this film because it looked
cool, the people in it were acting cool and all of the cars in it screamed
cool, but I can't honestly say that it was a good movie. I was never bored
during the film, but other than the last 30 minutes or so, I kept wondering
where all the action was. Just like every other Bruckheimer machismo guy
flick, there is always the prerequisite situation (I like to call it the
"A-Team scene") featuring the rounding up of a certain motley crew of
gruffy, down-and-out and badass MoFos, and the mobilization of the master
plan. Generally, this part only lasts a few minutes and we move on to a
whole lot of wham-bang-and-thank-you-ma'ams, but this film decided to spend
a lot more time on the set-up. Perhaps it was supposed to develop the
characters somehow, but despite the story being absorbing to a certain
extent, I did keep wondering when all the action was gonna take place,
especially when the holes started showing up in the plot.
And when they finally did begin stealing the cars, I was doubly surprised at
how little resistance (read action/fun blow 'em ups) there was as well. I
don't know, maybe I just expected too much popcorn for my buck, but despite
the film coming through as a whole, it did disappoint as an all-out nacho
flick. Cage was Cage once more, the staple hip, tough guy with a heart,
while the rest of the crew was a well-rounded bunch this time around. Lindo
was cool, Duvall is always fun to watch, Vinnie Jones is just waiting to be
discovered as the next action-hero superstar and Ribisi, well, I'll admit
that he's finally starting to get on my nerves with his down-and-out
character portrayals. I was also a little disappointed with the one-liners
in this film, which seemed a little weak this time around. But overall, the
film is a slick one to watch, offering a couple of rockin' action scenes,
some fun characters, and despite its plot holes (the cops know about their
entire plan the whole time, but they decide to send two incompetents after
them?), a somewhat interesting tale. And oh yeah...Angelina Jolie is barely
in it!
At this point, I think everyone knows what a "Bruckheimer movie" is, so
please don't go into this movie expecting anything more than that. With that
in mind, you might just enjoy yourself.

Another Hollywood wannabe epic film made mostly for the sake of wooing Oscar 
voters with its classic
story of eternal love and quest for vengeance. 
It's a guy movie and a chick flick at the same time. It has many exciting and 
bloody battle scenes which
service the plot about a Roman war general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) who 
was about to become
the next leader of the great empire until heir-apparent Commodus (Joaquin 
Phoenix) has him removed.
Commodus becomes an arrogant, selfish emperor who uses his power to service 
his own desires instead of
doing what's good for Rome. 
At 150 minutes the film is a bit overlong but at least its story is full of 
detail so pay close attention. The basic
plot is familiar and very Shakespearean, but the gladiator life Maximus finds 
himself trapped in is the most
interesting aspect of the film. Not as good as "Spartacus" or "Braveheart" 
but it's a fine effort.

     You are Nicolas Cage.  After clawing your way through B-movies to
an Academy Award for Leaving Las Vegas, what do you do?  You take part
after part in a progressively worsening slate of action films (pausing
only for the even worse melodrama City of Angels), bottoming out with
Snake Eyes and 8MM.  Your action career is at an obvious end.  So do you
go back to the drama you can pull off so well?
     No!  You take a role in Gone in 60 Seconds, and try to extend your
movie muscle even further!  Here's a movie that's pure, unabashed
Hollywood:  Randall "Memphis" Raines (Cage), in order to convince a mean
criminal to spare the life of his brother (Giovanni Ribisi), must BLOW
UP 50 cars in the next 72 hours!
     Er, wait a sec.  Steal.  STEAL 50 cars.  You see, Memphis is The
Best of The Best of L.A. car thieves.  Retired, of course, but a
fabulous car thief.  Naturally, kid brother follows in Memphis's
footsteps but gets himself into trouble, so Memphis has to come out of
retirement to save his butt.  It's a plot so insanely stupid it can only
mean one thing:  You are watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  (See also:
Armageddon.)
     The only part of 60 Seconds less believable than Ribisi and Cage
being related is Cage and nubile vixen Angelina Jolie being former
lovers.  In the film, Jolie plays the hiply-named "Sway", a likewise
retired car "boost" whose blonde dreadlocks make her both a blaring
"Look at Me!" siren during night jobs as well as a fire hazard.
     Naturally, I expect Gone in 60 Seconds to appeal to audiences for
the one (and only) reason it appealed to me:  Because there are lots and
lots of car chases with lots and lots of cool cars.  Naturally, Memphis
and crew are not stealing 50 Hyundais.  They're stealing Hummers,
Ferraris, Porsches, Aston Martins, Corvettes, T-Birds, and a mythical
1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 that becomes Memphis's Moby Dick.
     The cars are spun out, jumped, peeled out, jumped some more, and
accelerated to ungodly speeds.  Surprisingly, director Dominic Sena
(credited mostly with commercials) pulls this off with a remarkably low
body count, which is admirable.
     Gone in 60 Seconds is ultimately a feast for the eyes provided you
turn off your brain before you sit down to watch it.  Not to mention,
you'll be surprised how hard it is not to challenge the chump in the car
next to you to a little drag race on the ride home.
Director: Dominic Sena
Producer: Jerry Bruckheimer, Mike Stenson

GONE IN 60 SECONDS is a Jerry Bruckheimer production.  You know the 
drill.  Nonsensical explosions and crashes happen with a regularity that 
rivals an atomic clock for accuracy.  And like the constant ticking of a 
clock, the movie's repetitive pyrotechnics quickly become tiresome.  
Why, you will be asking yourself, do they keep doing the same old thing 
if they can't find any fresh ways to stage them?  (One has only to look 
at Jackie Chan in SHANGHAI NOON to see how one can find imaginative 
variations on an old theme.)
GONE IN 60 SECONDS is exactly how fast I wish it would have lasted.  
With such a pathetic lack of original ideas, the ironically titled movie 
should never have ground on for two hours.
A remake of a 1974 picture of the same name, GONE IN 60 SECONDS has a 
mildly interesting premise.  Randall "Memphis" Raines's (Nicolas Cage) 
brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), is in trouble with a not very convincing 
bad guy, Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston).  Memphis is lured out 
of car-thief retirement by Raymond's threat to kill Kip unless Memphis 
steals a precise list of 50 cars in 3 days.  Many of these are hard to 
find, none more so than Memphis's nemesis, a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500.
The rest of the story concerns the countdown as they steal the cars.  
And it's about as much fun to watch as staring at the hour hand on the 
clock.  If you're new to movies and haven't seen car chases, you may 
find this all diverting.  But if you've seen one of the better 
Bruckheimer's films, such as THE ROCK, then you'll know how lame most of 
the car chases are in GONE IN 60 SECONDS.
Others come along with Memphis for the big heist.  Robert Duvall is the 
wise old veteran.  Angelina Jolie is there to supply the sex appeal.  
And there are lots of others in a largely wasted cast.  Finally, Delroy 
Lindo is the police investigator who can't quite catch the thieves even 
with a hundred cop cars to support him. 
Do they steal the cars in time?  Is Kip killed?  Unfortunately, the 
movie gives us remarkably little reason to care about any of this.
The only completely satisfying part of the production?  The 
deep-throated growl that the Shelby machine produces from the theater's 
subwoofers.  This low-pitched roar is the movie's only genuine visceral 
thrill.  
GONE IN 60 SECONDS runs 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for violence, sexuality 
and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.

There's something admirable about a film that manages to entertain
despite not making any sense at all.  As you sit through films like Gone
in 60 Seconds, your brain practically screams, `Get up and leave before
you rot me away!' but the message never quite makes it down to your
feet.  Somewhere in between your head and toes, something happens that
makes you sit there with a dopey grin on your face for two hours before
getting up and admitting `Geez, that was pretty good.'  Personally, I
blame the sneaky epiglottis for intercepting the brain's warning
message, but I have no concrete proof of this.
Seconds is about a retired car thief named Randall "Memphis" Raines
(Nicolas Cage, Bringing Out the Dead) who is temporarily drafted back
into a life of crime when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi,
Boiler Room) ends up in hot water with a local bad ass with an English
accent and a fetish for handcrafted wooden furniture.  The Brit is
Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston, eXistenZ), and he turns down
Memphis' offer of $10,000 for Kip, instead making the older Raines
brother agree to boost fifty specific automobiles in four days to
prevent him from becoming an only child.
It doesn't take long to set up the film's premise (about fifteen
minutes), and I settled back in my seat under the assumption that I was
in for a good hour-and-a-half of car boosting and the hilarious hijinks
attendant thereto.  But Seconds doesn't go down like that.  While the
bottom of the screen reminds viewers that there are only seventy-two
hours remaining in Memphis' deadline, he has a touchy-feely breakfast
with Kip.  Wait a second.  Kip?  Why the heck would Calitri let Kip go?
Couldn't he just skip town with Memphis and his $10,000 and leave
Calitri and the car-jacking business behind them?
Memphis blows the next few days visiting his mom (Grace Zabriskie, Twin
Peaks) and trying to put together a team of top-notch car thieves.  He
starts with the man that taught him everything he knows: former
chop-shop owner Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall, A Civil Action).
Together, Memphis and Otto complete the rest of their lawbreaking
lineup.  The ranks include a mechanic/bartender named Sara "Sway"
Wayland (Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted), a mute morgue attendant
called `The Sphinx' (Vinnie Jones, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels),
and a driving instructor named Donny Astricky (Chi McBride, Mercury
Rising).  Memphis also reluctantly agrees to let Kip's gang assist in
the heist.  The Gen-Y brigands include Scott Caan  (Ready to Rumble),
James Duval (Go), T.J. Cross and William Lee Scott (Black & White).
Memphis and his criminal comrades plan to steal all fifty cars in one
twelve-hour period.  And not just any twelve-hour period, but, of
course, the twelve-hour period immediately before the deadline (I
shouldn't complain  I waited until the morning of my 12th grade English
class to write my final thesis, even though I had months to complete the
project).  To make matters worse, Memphis and crew are being pursued by
two cops (Delroy Lindo, Romeo Must Die, and Timothy Olyphant, Go), as
well as a rival gang of car thieves that actually complained that
Memphis stole the fifty-car job out from under them.  
Okay, let me get this straight:  They're willing to do Calitri's heist,
but he insists on using a rusty ex-thief and his band of miscreants
instead?
You know that the heist is going to go down to the wire, which begs the
question `Why didn't they start earlier?'  There's the mandatory chase
through the L.A. River Aqueduct (which, at this point, is used only for
filming Hollywood chase scenes), and the big shoot-em-up action finale
is so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't help laughing out loud.
And don't get up and leave when the big chase scene is over, because
you'll miss Jones' hysterical, out-of-the-blue line, which is probably
the best since Alyson Hannigan's `One time, in band camp' confession in
American Pie.
There are so many things in Seconds that just don't make sense, and I'm
not sure I even have the space to list all of them here.  Like when the
bandits break into a warehouse full of about fifty rare, expensive cars,
and the five that they need to boost are all lined up behind one another
for easy removal.  And how do you explain that each thief gets back out
on the streets after they drop off the car they've just stolen?  Seconds
isn't even sure what city it's supposed to take place in, mentioning
Long Beach several times, but filming multiple scenes in San Francisco
in addition to the Los Angeles suburb.
Seconds is also full of all of the spastic editing, plot-holes and lack
of female characters that you come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer
(Armageddon) produced summer blockbuster.  In addition to inciting the
audience to root against the police and for the criminals, Seconds also
features a couple of pretty bad racial stereotypes (black people can't
swim and Asian women can't drive).
Seconds was directed by Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) and written by Scott
Rosenberg (ConAir), who adapted the script from a little-seen 1974 H.B.
Halicki film of the same name (it spawned a sequel called The Junkman
eight years later).  Despite its many flaws, Seconds is still worth the
price of admission just for the unique and diverse casting, which
includes big-name stars, regulars in independent cinema, a British
soccer star and  get this  three Oscar winners (Cage, Jolie and
Duvall).
