Sansom, John Fiedler, Peter Cullen. Directed by Jun Falkenstein. Rated
G.
You would expect the first theatrical feature based on the popular A.
A. Milne Winnie the Pooh tales to be something memorable, children's
entertainment for the ages. You'd think so, wouldn't you? Well, Disney
never ceases to surprise us. This release seems purely perfunctory,
made for a quick buck with no heart or much effort poured into it. It
doesn't even star everybody's favorite bear (assuming you don't like
Yogi). The Tigger Movie is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff; the youngest
set of kids might enjoy it, but I doubt they'll want to watch it again
or even remember it after a couple of days. Call me a Disney purist,
but when it comes to their animation department, I expect the best and
am rather irritated when I don't get it.
Pooh has crushingly little screen time because, as one might glean from
the title, the focus of the film is Tigger, that lovable, striped
companion. Unable to find anyone to "bounce" with him one afternoon,
Tigger realizes that he might have a family somewhere and goes off
searching for it. He looks for a family tree -- literally a tree,
because he doesn't know any better. He's inevitably disappointed
because even with the help of his moderately bouncy young kangaroo
companion Roo, the search comes up empty.
Seeing their pal's disappointment, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Iore plot
to write a phony letter from his family and then have a phony family
(them dressed in Tigger costumes) show up at Tigger's door. The final
message, of course, is that friends are your family too and, as might
be expected from a movie whose target audience's age is in the single
digits, it is delivered with little subtlety. I'm perfectly fine with
this as long as there is a certain grace and joie de vivre to the film.
That's where this Tigger comes up short.
The animation is old-school and that's the way it's supposed to be. It
has that very Pooh-ish storybook quality that fits the franchise like a
glove; it's Disney's one cash cow that has refused to be taken over by
high-tech gimmickery. What doesn't work is, well, everything else.
Tigger's a pretty good character, but his babbling, word-butchering
schtick gets old pretty fast. That's usually where the supporting
players come to the rescue but The Tigger Movie doesn't let them be
themselves. Winnie himself shows up only a couple of times so that he
can do his trademark climbing-a-tree-after-honey-only-to-be-attacked-by-
a-swarm-of-bees. Iore's presence, too, is merely for the sake of him
being there. Piglet barely even opens his mouth. The Disney movie mill
has stripped these beloved, age-old characters of almost all
personality for the sake of commercialization and also to fit everyone
into an 80-minute movie while focusing primarily on Tigger. The Winnie
the Pooh series was so enduring because the characters worked together
to solve a problem; this really is Tigger's movie.
I, of course, am not the target audience for this film so I am hard-
pressed to say whether you should take your children to see this movie
or not. The youngest set will almost certainly enjoy it. But when it
comes to continuing the Pooh saga with grace and dignity, The Tigger
Movie doesn't get the job done. It's passable, but I apparently wanted
more than Disney could provide with a film that isn't their
annual "animated feature."

Slightly amusing and totally innocuous, but ultimately troubled, The
Tigger Movie proves that even the almighty Disney can mess up a
children's film. No, its not as bad as the mess formally known as
Pokemon and the non-summer/non-Thanksgiving release date should act as
a tip off, but Pooh and company are capable of much more than this 74
minute blemish on the legendary Hundred-Acre Wood.
The rambunctious Tigger is looking for someone to go bouncing with
(after all, that's what Tiggers do best!) when he manages to test the
nerves of all his pals, especially Rabbit. As it becomes obvious that
no one can bounce quite like Tigger (although Roo, the kangaroo,
certainly does try), Rabbit sarcastically advises that Tigger find his
family and go bouncing with them.  Taking these words to a literal
extreme, our protagonist begins the search for his long-lost family.
What the movie does have going for it is the unforgettable qualities
of its characters. Winnie the Pooh is the innocent and well meaning
but intellectually challenged bear. Owl is the wise and
good-intentioned but ultimately insomnia-curing owl. Piglet is the
adorable little pig who is light as a feather. Eeyore is the sluggish
and self-unimportant donkey that is cursed with bad luck. Kanga is the
single mother that every kangaroo would love to have. And Tigger is,
well, Tigger is T-I-double guh-rrr, Tigger.
Unlike the recent family hit, Toy Story 2, The Tigger Movie has little
to offer on any level other than that appealing to its five-year-old
audience.  The one time anything multidimensional is attempted comes
when The Brady Bunch, Rodin's Thinker and other non-pre-school
references are made in a chorus-line production that sticks out like a
talking tiger in a Lethal Weapon movie.
One thing parents needn't worry about here are the morals portrayed;
they are all family-value oriented. Roo, the little kangaroo, has only
a single mother, Kanga. Tigger occupies and mentors Roo by taking him
along on his quest and teaching him things like the
whoopdidoopersuperlooperallilooper bounce. Roo, in turn, cares for
Tigger and tries to cheer him up when his voyage is looking dim.
Although the trait has become synonymous with Disney films, sappiness
prevails a little too much here. The normally cheerful humor of
Christopher Robin's pals is weighed down by slow-paced songs that
clearly exist to 1) try to bring the audience to tears and 2) sell a
lot of soundtracks.
As I was leaving the theatre after seeing this film, someone asked me
if I thought it was a classic. After all, many Disney animated
features achieve that status and Winnie the Pooh certainly has as
well. My answer was "no" and, probably because of the hereditary
higher standard this movie is held to, that means it is a failure.

I feel kind of bad so casually dismissing kindhearted kids' fare like "The
Tigger Movie", in which Tigger goes on a search for his "real" family after
being rejected by Pooh Bear and Co. when he requests that they go bouncing with
him and demands that, eventually, they all discover that they are his family,
but too much of this film had me thinking that AA Milne would be rotating like
a rotisserie in his grave over this literary sacrilege. The movie's
themeâ'accepting different kinds of families, particularly adoptiveâ'is nice
enough, but the metaphor isn't disguised too well. The presence of "Toy Story
2" in the same multiplex had me drawing a mental Venn diagram of their positive
aspects, and ultimately finding the similarities column thin, and the "Toy
Story 2" column about ten times longer than Falkensteinâs obvious potboiler.
Meanwhile, the movie rushes with the narrative, but somehow seems prolonged as
a whole, even though it clocks in at a mercifully short 77 minutes. Nice try,
but something about "The Tigger Movie" just screams "Direct-to-Video".

In Disney's THE TIGGER MOVIE, Tigger is busily searching for a tree, but
not just any tree.  Hoping to be united with other tiggers, he's looking
high and low in the Hundred Acre Wood in hopes of discovering his family
tree.
In a world in which every kid's movie works hard to morph into a
full-fledged family movie by blending Woody Allen adult humor with STAR
WARS special effects, THE TIGGER MOVIE is a delightful throwback to a
simpler time -- a time when every kid's movie didn't feel obligated to
throw in vague sexual innuendoes and transparent bathroom humor and a
time when the animation didn't look like it was prepared on computers
sophisticated enough for nuclear weapons simulation.
This charming little picture, based on the beloved A. A. Milne
children's books, sets itself a modest goal of entertaining a crowded
room full of squirming youngsters and attains it admirably.  (Actually,
just keeping a bunch of little kids in their seats with their eyes
transfixed to the screen is probably rather an ambitious goal, as any
parent can attest.)  The more amazing part of the simple story is the
pleasant effect that it has on the adults.  Without a single line that
they can call their own, the old fogies in the audience will find
themselves just as touched by these wonderfully sweet characters.
Granted, not a lot happens in the movie, but the drawings are handsome
and the characters compelling and lively.  Tigger, voiced by Jim
Cummings, who also does the voice of Winnie the Pooh, does what tiggers
do best, which is lots of bouncing.  A high-spirited and good-spirited
character, Tigger is a character who deserves his own movie.
Tigger's a funny guy who says some of his precious old lines ("TTFN:
Ta-Ta For Now.") and some new ones.  Among the latter, a particularly
good example has Tigger describing his little buddy Roo as "lacking in
the perpendicular."
The gorgeous animation uses picture book images rather than realism in
the drawing.  This gives the movie a lush look that reminds you of
illustrated books from your childhood.  The movie sometimes comes back
to the book itself and lets the drawings on the pages come alive.
Among the show's other delights is a song-and-dance dream sequence
featuring rows of tiggers performing in everything from chorus lines to
synchronized swimming.
The message of the film is an old-fashioned one lifted straight out of
the WIZARD OF OZ: There's no place like home.  Tigger realizes that his
friends are his family.  Like the rest of the movie, it's a sweet and
simple theme, which is delivered with understated delicacy.
THE TIGGER MOVIE runs just 1:16.  It is rated G and has nothing to
offend or frighten anyone of any age.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the film *** and remarked that it would be
great for all ages. He couldn't think of anything he didn't like about
it. His cousin William, age 5, loved the picture, giving it ****. His
favorite part was when the avalanche hit. William's sister, Liana, age
3, doesn't talk much. At her first theatrical movie, she was clearly
fascinated. On the edge of her seat through most of the picture, she
stared in big-eyed delight at it.

"The wonderful thing about tiggers is that tiggers are wonderful things.
Their tops are made of rubber, their bottoms are made of springs ... But the
very most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one!" an exuberant
Tigger bounces into action, tumbling to the ground the other ho-hum, yet
lovable, characters in Christopher Robin's Hundred Acre Wood.
Pooh's troop of animated stuffed animals being either too busy or just too
darned laid-back to bounce with him, Tigger finds himself direly lonely.
"I'm the one and onlyest one ... how I wish there was a double or a triple
of me."
Fluttering to help, Owl goes out on a limb by sending Tigger into the cold
wintry forest in search of his family tree.
While Tigger is innately effervescent, the rest of the cast (save for a
spirited Roo-boy) is rather lackluster in spite of their cute black-button
eyes and occasional charming remarks. The washed out watercolor look of
Pooh's woods is beautiful in its own way, but never was meant to carry the
thunder and excitement we've more recently come to expect from Disney with
it's thickly rich animated films like "Tarzan" and "Toy Story2." Though this
one is Tigger's movie, it's still Winnie's world and in defiance of one wild
cat's enthusiastic attempts, the picture remains soft on color, action, and
in the end quite wordy.
Nowhere in the film is this point better made than at the start and end of a
truly contrasting musical interjection. In the middle of the production,
Tigger is given an outstanding Broadway number in which he dreams/sings his
family history in a collage of American culture and European art recreated
entirely with Tigger faces. The texture of the production sparks here, it
firework-jerks our Eeyore-lazy hearts from their calm and stands out from
the rest of the picture like an orange-striped cat in the snow. It's
wonderful.
In all fairness, Pooh sings a sweet little "lulla-bee" calming nasty buzzing
bees into a hypnotic slumber, so that he might dip into that luscious honey
sapping from a tree that could have been Tigger's family tree. The film
would have benefited with more songs of this golden syrup-dipity.
I also enjoyed the snow rendering, which flickers in flakes of unique and
changing shapes. And though I'm no longer innocent enough to enjoy the tame
and many sight gags; your younger children might. However, I did get a kick
out of Tigger's word misinterpretations and blunders. In one instance, after
forgetting to offer refreshments to his guests he blurts, "Where are my
mannerisms?" And then, in a party mood, mistakenly almost asks Eeyore, "Or
how about a game of pin the tail on the do..." Jim Cummings does a smashing
job of Tigger-talk and remarkably speaks for Pooh too - vocally and in song.
In the end, the tender heartwarming climax and resolution may just choke you
up a bit in the Adam's apple - as they did I.

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/a1fda18037607f220825687f00082b58?OpenDocument
Bouncy, flouncy, trouncy, pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  The
wonderful thing about The Tigger Movie is it's fun for everyone.  And it
truly is.  Guaranteed to bring both smiles and tears to every face,
young and old alike, Walt Disney Pictures' The Tigger Movie is a
refreshing surprise.
OK, I'll be the first to admit it  I wasn't looking forward to this
picture.  Yet another Disney animated epic, jam-packed with computer
generated cels, overdone musical numbers, and one-dimensional characters
that long ago stopped being characters and became cartoons.  "More
colorful fluff to sell t-shirts, pajamas and tennis shoes," I mumbled to
myself as I took my seat.  "Eye candy."  But as the curtain drew up to
reveal a pre-movie Disney-style mambo from Lou Vega (of "Mambo No.9"
fame), I was whisked back to a time when a man named Walt Disney first
introduced us to our imaginations.
The new Tigger Movie is simply, beautifully done, and art director Toby
Bluth has indeed created the definitive Pooh film.  The line drawings
are incredibly true to the original E.H. Shepard drawings from the A.A.
Milne books, and they are layered upon a breathtaking watercolor canvas.
Light and air seem to be literally washed into the scenes, giving the
Hundred Acre Wood an authentic English countryside feel, complete with
light-reflecting moisture. The color palette and the weather cleverly
follow the emotional arc of the story, ranging from rich and warm autumn
days to cold, purple and gray snowstorms.
If the stunning look of the new movie doesn't reel you directly in, the
script and characters will.  Kudos to first-time director and
screenwriter Jun Falkenstein for breathing life into the classic world
of Pooh that we remember.  The vernacular and dialogue hold true to the
original stories, and the characters are rich and full, giving a
perspective to each player that we have never seen before.  Falkenstein
allows us to delve a little bit deeper into the characters, and he
really makes them come alive.  Tigger displays a range of emotions that
is really quite sophisticated, and our lovable, bumbling Pooh bear
remains as willy-nilly silly as ever.
In another brilliant brainstorm, Falkenstein has reunited the
award-winning songwriting team of Richard and Robert Sherman with
Disney.  Disney fans will remember the inimitable word play and charming
melodies of the Sherman brothers from movies such as Mary Poppins,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and The Jungle Book, to name a few.  In 1990,
the Sherman brothers were named `Disney Legends,' and we are not let
down by the six wonderful new songs from this movie, including a
Tiggerific new tongue-twisting `Whoop de dooper, loop de looper, ally
ooper bounce' song.
At the core of this new adventure is a heartwarming story that everyone
can relate to.  Tigger is in search of his family and embarks upon a
quest that inevitably leads him right back to the Hundred Acre Wood and
the friends who truly love him.  Tigger learns that family, more than
looking alike or being related by blood, is really about the people who
are closest to you and who really love you, through good times and bad.
The story stays simple and true, with a message that even the youngest
viewers will appreciate and enjoy.
Bouncing full of fun, laughter, tears and "indomitibibble" spirit, The
Tigger Movie has everything we hope for from the original Pooh, with new
life and depth.  Complete with the narrative talents of John Hurt
(replacing Sebastian Cabot), an exquisite vocal cast, and even one epic
Fantasia-esque song sequence full of all the pomp and color we expect
from Disney (yes, there are even synchronized Tigger-swimmers and a
hummingbird chorus), The Tigger Movie (that's T-I-double Guh-E-R-R) is
not to be missed.  Take your kids, take your date, take your grandma 
this one would do Walt proud.

Coming at a time when so many family films aim to bowl audiences over
with razzle-dazzle animation ("Toy Story 2"), state-of-the-art
animatronics ("Stuart Little") or nonstop merchandising ("Pokemon: The
First Movie"), "The Tigger Movie" represents a refreshing detour from
the norm.  Recent Disney efforts such as "Tarzan" and "Mulan" have
employed gorgeous, almost three-dimensional visuals, but "Tigger" has
a retro look that's very much in line with the 1960s shorts "Winnie
the Pooh and the Honey Tree" and the Oscar-winning "Winnie the Pooh
and the Blustery Day." As in those films, most of the art looks like
it was based on watercolors and charcoal sketches, and it's a pleasant
blast from the past.
Nor do the songs by veteran Disney music men Richard M.  Sherman and
Robert B. Sherman ("Mary Poppins") have much to do with the Phil
Collins pop of "Tarzan." Instead, they're simply clever little ditties
that spring from the characters: Pooh warbles a "Lullabee" to put a
hive full of angry bees to sleep, while Tigger's "'Round My Family
Tree" underscores his fantasy about his ancestors.
The voices may have changed a little in the past 30 years - Jim
Cummings does splendid work voicing both Tigger and Pooh, while Nikita
Hopkins' Roo has just the right mix of sweetness and spunk - but the
sweet-natured characters and gentle humor have been preserved. So has
the concept of having the story's episodes pop off the pages of a
book, a subtle reminder that if you like the movie, you might want to
read the original A.A. Milne tales.
My 4-year-old niece Rachael (who, for the record, loved the movie, as
did her 6-year-old sister Megan and 2-year-old sister Emily) astutely
compared "Tigger" to "The Last Unicorn," an underappreciated 1982
feature which has become one of her personal favorites. Like
"Unicorn," it involves a unique creature - in this case, Tigger, of
course - who goes off in search of its own kind and learns a valuable
lesson in the process.
Tigger's journey is sparked by an accident in which Tigger
inadvertently drops a boulder on the deadpan donkey Eeyore's home
(don't worry: Eeyore isn't inside at the time) and incurs the wrath of
Rabbit.
Ordinarily, Tigger might have laughed off the incident.  But Roo, the
young kangaroo who Tigger describes as being on "the smallish side of
tiny and a little bit lacking in the perpendicular," idolizes Tigger
and has innocently put thoughts in Tigger's head about the possibility
he's not the only spring-loaded feline in the world. So Tigger sets
off on an "expotition" to uncover his history, a process complicated
by the involvement of Pooh Bear, Owl, Kanga and Piglet.
The story makes the same point as "Stuart Little," that a family is
not defined by its physical similarities, but by the feelings members
share for each other. There's nothing wrong with being different,
we're told, especially if you can still love - and be loved by - those
who aren't like you.  That's an important message for children to
hear, particularly those who feel like outsiders in their peer group
because of their size or talents, and it's quite entertainingly
conveyed here.
"The Tigger Movie" is preceded by a brief music video from Lou Bega,
in which he rewrites his Top 10 hit "Mambo No.  5" as a tribute to
Disney characters: "a little bit of Minnie in my life, a little bit of
Mickey by her side," etc. It cracked up most of the kids and several
of the adults in the preview audience.

_The_Tigger_Movie_ (G) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        It kind of bullyish to knock a film as gentle as this big-screen
showcase for the beloved, bouncy staple (voiced by Jim Cummings) of A.A.
Milne's _Winnie_the_Pooh_ books, but I'm afraid that's what I'm going to
do.  All the familiar characters in the Hundred Acre Wood--Tigger, Pooh
(also voiced by Cummings), Piglet (John Fiedler), Eeyore (Peter Cullen),
Rabbit (Ken Sansom), Owl (Andre Stojka), Kanga (Kath Soucie), and Roo
(Nikita Hopkins)--are as cute and charming as they have ever been (which
accounts for their enduring appeal), but cuteness can only go so far in
keeping an obvious, if warm and well-meaning, story interesting to
adults.  The plot has Tigger, who had always said that "the wonderful
thing about tiggers is I'm the only one," searching for the family he
never knew.  The outcome of the story--and its moral--will be quite
apparent to adults in the early going, and the slapsticky gags that fill
the space in between will hold only faint interest to those older than 9.
        What are obviously designed to keep the grown-ups interested are the
songs by _Pooh_ veterans the Sherman Brothers, Richard M. and Robert B. 
There's a curious choice at the heart of the song score: for some reason
screenwriter-director Jun Falkenstein decided to shoehorn
_The_Tigger_Movie_ into the traditional Disney musical formula.  So
Tigger gets his own "I Want" song, as well as a big showstopping
production number.  Both songs --and the others--are pleasant enough (if
not terribly memorable), but I wish that Disney let Pooh be Pooh, Tigger
be Tigger; the production number feels especially out of place, taking
the action away from the Hundred Acre Wood and into Tigger's surreal
Busby Berkeley/"Be Our Guest"-style fantasies.  Tigger and his friends
have remained family favorites over the years by remaining themselves,
and the studio should have had more faith in them to not mold it into the
cookie cutter it had already begun to shy away from.  Of course, kids
won't care, and _The_Tigger_Movie_ will finds its true worth on video,
for it'll make an ideal 76-minute babysitter.

     Disney has been responsible for plenty of icons of childhood over the
past 60 years, but if my son's wardrobe and stuffed animal collection are
any indication, no libretto has been kinder to Uncle Walt's Place over the
years than the works of A. A. Milne. Edward Bear (d.b.a. Winnie the Pooh) 
and friends have made Disney a mint in licensing fees, TV programs and the
like, with Pooh's roly-poly visage become the very image of cuddly
innocence. Kids adore these characters beyond measure, as befits
characters based on a real child's own beloved playthings.
     THE TIGGER MOVIE is by no stretch of the imagination an embarrassing
chapter in Disney's relationship with the Pooh gang; indeed, it's light
and generally pleasant. It just seems a shame for these characters to be
wasted on filler between Disney's _real_ animated films. The story finds
the titular bouncy, pouncy fellow (voiced by Jim Cummings) struggling a
bit with the fact that, as the song says about Tiggers, "(he's) the only
one." Convinced that there must be a Tigger family out there somewhere,
Tigger begins a search through the Hundred Acre Wood for his family tree
accompanied by a helpful Roo (Nikita Hopkins). When no family is found,
Pooh (also voiced by Cummings) and company try to help out, but a letter
they write from "Tigger's family" only ends up complicating matters
further.
     The talent involved in the creation of THE TIGGER MOVIE offered
plenty of hope that it could be plenty entertaining. Many longtime
voice participants in the Pooh universe, including original Piglet John
Fiedler, lend their gifts to the story, providing a sense of continuity
from earlier stories. Even more promising was the participation of veteran
Disney songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman, the legendary brother
tandem behind hummable hits like "The Bear Necessities," "Everybody Wants
to Be a Cat," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and even the original
"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers." This was not the sort of interest
you'd expect to find in a cheap knock-off.
    And THE TIGGER MOVIE isn't a cheap knock-off. It just never feels
particularly inspired, or particularly true to Milne's amiable tales. The
story is simple enough, a lesson in the love one can find in a family
that doesn't necessarily involve genetic similarity or legal sanction (one
can almost hear the reactionary letters being prepared at Disney's
insouciance regarding the national security importance of the nuclear
family). Yet that's the sort of lesson-mongering one would never associate
with Pooh and company. One also wouldn't expect a story that needed to be
spiced up with a climactic avalanche to give it a sense of drama. One
certainly wouldn't expect that the Shermans' song contributions would be
such a lackluster lot, with even the most obvious effort to create a
catchy standard -- the pop culture-filled production number "Round My
Family Tree" -- falling short. For a Disney film, it sure feels a lot more
like one of the more half-hearted attempts to mimic a Disney film.
     In all fairness, it should be clear that THE TIGGER MOVIE seemed to
delight it's target audience of kindergarteners. There are even some
enjoyable moments to delight those of us who are slightly older kids,
including the perfectly pitched pessimism of Eeyore (Peter Cullen) and
Tigger's colorful way with a malaprop. It's a cute film in its way, but
there are those of us who expect more from Disney when some of its most
beloved characters are plopped into a new film. The bar is set a little
bit higher, because it's too easy to fall back on the audience's good will
towards those characters without insuring the vehicle is as tuneful,
playful and easy-going as Pooh-bear himself. THE TIGGER MOVIE isn't
bad. It just doesn't feel particularly deserving of its stars. Call me a 
sentimentalist, but I like to think of Pooh as more than just a marketable
brand-name.

Full of fun, great animation and fine voice-acting, Walt Disney Pictures' 
THE TIGGER MOVIE is a welcome addition to the bleak theater offerings of 
mid-February.
Taking full advantage of the solid Winnie the Pooh franchise, the producers 
have added new dimensions to many of its characters.  We see the most of 
Tigger, of course, the namesake of the movie;  he is friendly towards all 
the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood.  What's charming is that this 
treatment creates a close friendship between Tigger and Roo, the tiny son of 
Kanga, and the most child-like character, besides Tigger himself.
The main plot of the film has Tigger yearning for a family of his own:  it's 
no longer the most wonderful thing about Tiggers, that he's the only one!
At first the group of animal friends goes off on little sorties, searching 
for other Tiggers, as though they are convinced of their existence.  Finally 
- and this is perfect - the friends agree to write a letter to Tigger, from 
his family;  the pompous Owl wields the pen, and the letter is co-written, 
one line from each of the major characters.  It's heartfelt advice, stuff 
like "Eat well" (Pooh-bear's contribution), "Stay safe and sound," and other 
sentiments, reveals much about the true and important feeling imparted by 
membership in a family unit.  Soon the letter is on its way, and Tigger is 
indeed convinced that his family is real.  When Tigger readies his 
ramshackle house for a welcoming party, his motley friends end up donning 
Tigger costumes and try to trick their overactive tiger-like pal.  Some of 
the most cinematically stunning effects in any Pooh installment follow 
Tigger's disappointment at discovering he's been hoodwinked by his 
overzealous pals.
The voices are among the most engaging aspects of the movie.  Jim Cummings 
has done Pooh's voice since 1987, emulating well the hoarse mildness of the 
late Sterling Holloway.  Now he has assumed the duties of Tigger as well, 
after Disney's dismissal of the inimitable Paul Winchell.  It is amazing, 
however, how much Cummings sounds like the persona created by Winchell.  The 
inflections, wacky asides and "hoo-hoo" laughter is nearly dead-on.
Nine year-old Nikita Hopkins supplies the voice of Roo, an innocent and 
likable voice that's perfectly cast. Kanga is Kath Soucie, the ever-patient 
and loving mother-figure.
Peter Cullen does a nice job with the pessimistic Eeyore, an amusing droop 
to his voice.  Owl is voiced by Andre Stojka, a nice edge of pretension to 
his depiction.  Tom Attenborough does not get much screen time as 
Christopher Robin, the human owner of the "dolls" that live in the Hundred 
Acre Wood.  And veteran actor John Hurt does a decent turn as the narrator.  
I liked how this incarnation preserves the 1960's narrative technique of 
showing a storybook, letters and words pouring off the page at times.  But 
Hurt is not used enough to exert a strong presence in the story.
The sole carry-over from the old cast (which originated the Disney version 
of A. A. Milne's classic stories with the Academy Award-winning short 
"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" in 1968) is John Fielder as Piglet, 
whose voice is even more light and humble than Pooh's.  Long experience has 
added a subtle sheen of sympathy to the voice of the friendly little pig.
Another star is the animation.  Much of it was done at Disney's Japan 
animation center, with other parts being shared around the globe.  Featured 
are muted colors - hues that compliment well the simple and heart-warming 
narrative line.  The green pastel trees and stylized backgrounds are 
unmistakably Disney, a quaint throwback mix of the "Disneyfied" and "Classic 
Pooh" styles in some ways.
Music is also excellent.  The original team that has done all the music for 
previous Poohs is back: Richard M. Sherman and brother Robert B. Sherman.  
The pace and lyrics and overall effect of their original songs add a good 
deal to the enjoyment factor.  Kenny Loggins collaborated on the closing 
ballad, while Harry Gregson-Williams capably supplied the rest of the score.
The film is rated G, another rare and welcome element in today's viewing 
culture.  It is very watchable for all ages, as the story moves quickly 
forward, not without a generous sprinkling of wit along the way.  See it now 
with a child or without;  it's one of those films you will never be sorry 
you sat through!

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I've never been much of a Tigger fan and, for the life of me, I can't
figure out why some people get so worked up over him.  Sure, he looks
cuddly, but to me he's always seemed like a lightweight Daffy Duck
knock-off (even though Tigger was around first).  I barely wanted to see
the film as it was, so imagine my horror when the theatre lights finally
go down and the screen lights up with something called `Disney Mambo No.
5,' which is basically a music video featuring
fourteen-and-a-half-minutes-into-his-fame Lou Bega.
The animated Tigger actually kicks off with a live-action scene of
Christopher Robin's bedroom.  For those of you that don't know the
basics of the whole `Pooh' story, Christopher was the son of creator
A.A. Milne, who wrote a series of books in the 1920s that were based on
his boy's stuffed animals plus a couple of real animals that lived in
the wooded area near their home.  Tigger's story is basically depicted
as one of the books in Christopher's room and is narrated by some
invisible guy that turns the pages of the book as the film progresses.
As viewers are initially submerged into the world of the Hundred-Acre
Wood, Tigger appears and sings a song proclaiming that the wonderful
thing about Tiggers is that he is the only one.  Damn straight, brother
 and thank God for that.  Tigger is a bouncer, apparently deriving
great pleasure from using his tail as a pogo stick and springing all
over the place.  He tries to get his friends to bounce with him, but
they're all too busy  raspy Pooh is too busy stockpiling pots of hunny
and worrywart Piglet seems concerned only for the amount of firewood he
has saved for the winter.  Only little Roo seems to have the patience to
deal with Tigger, who pretty much annoys everyone in the whole
Hundred-Acre Wood.  As they try to get things done, he bugs them - kind
of like a bouncy orange Kramer.
And speaking of Roo, who is his father?  The original Pooh books must
have been pretty edgy for the 20s, portraying Kanga as a single mother
way before it was fashionable.  She doesn't look too slutty, and since
the characters in these stories are fairly limited, my money would be on
the downtrodden Eeyore.  It's always the quiet ones you have to watch
out for.  And will somebody get Pooh a shirt that will fit over his
giant belly?  That little red number just doesn't cut it.  He looks like
a film critic, for Christ's sake.
Anyway, the story follows Tigger as he searches for his family during
the onset of winter.  He wants to track them down to have someone to
bounce with  something that I've always felt should be accomplished
with a person outside of the family.  He imagines what his family looks
like (shown through paintings inspired by Dali,Warhol, et al.) and he
sings songs.  A lot of songs.  There were at least seven that I was
awake forand the film is only seventy-eight minutes long.  Do the math
 that's better than a song every ten minutes, toppling Topsy-Turvy for
the championship of the world.
The best scene is probably supposed to be when they all don Tigger
costumes to pose as his family, but the whole thing is depicted in the
film's poster, not to mention toy stores that have already begun to sell
stuffed Poohs and Piglets wearing Tigger suits.  The animation is less
that spectacular, but it's pretty true to the pictures in the Disney
books.  The voice work is also pretty lackluster, with the performers'
credits reading like a `who's not' in the animation industry.  Most of
their previous work is listed as `Additional Voices,' which pretty much
amounts to cartoon voice extras.
But, hey  it's short, the kids will probably dig it and it's not
Pokémon.  It could be a lot worse.

The Diva and I have an unwritten agreement for our 3BC reviews: she 
watches all the scary movies - I can't handle them at all, as evidenced 
in my reaction to The Bone Collector- and I, in turn, go to the assorted 
kiddie fare.  It's been a fair trade so far, but the downside, for my 
part, is that as an adult without small children to use as "cover", I 
feel kinda silly going to see these kid flicks.  "Toy Story 2" 
notwithstanding, I realized early on that the ongoing struggle I'd have 
would be to temper my natural inclination toward expecting Greatness 
from each and every movie I watch, with the understanding that some 
things just aren't written for old fogies like me.  That in mind, I was 
almost sure that I'd be watching a movie that I'd be making lots of 
allowances for in the end.
That said, a funny thing happened on the way to the end of "The Tigger 
Movie" ...
The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
In this animated rendition of A.A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" stories, 
narrated by John Hurt, Winnie The Pooh bear (voice of Jim Cummings) 
takes a back seat to Tigger (voice of Jim Cummings).  Tigger is an 
extroverted tiger who bounces his way in and out of the hearts of his 
friends Pooh, Eeyore the donkey (Peter Cullen), Piglet (John Fiedler), 
Rabbit (Ken Sansom), Owl (Andre Stojka), the human boy Christopher Robin 
(Tom Attenborough), kangaroo Kanga (Kathy Soucie), and especially 
Kanga's son Roo (Nikita Hopkins), who looks up to his good friend Tigger 
as a big brother.  Tigger's habit of joyfully bouncing all over the 
place irks the serious Rabbit and tires everyone but Roo out, but Tigger 
doesn't let them steal his joy for long.  But his joy over being "the 
only Tigger" turns to sadness when he realizes that being the only one, 
means he's without a family; seeing him so sad distresses Roo, who 
enlists Pooh bear and the others to help him find Tigger's family - with 
potentially disastrous results...
The Upshot:
There's a cartoon strip called Calvin And Hobbes that, like this movie, 
features a tiger (Hobbes) as one of the main characters (but unlike 
Christopher Robin from the "Winnie The Pooh" books and movies, the human 
Calvin is an at times bratty and irritating, though almost always funny, 
perpetually 8-year-old boy).  The first few times I read that cartoon 
strip (mind you, as an adult), I found it incredibly dumb; for the life 
of me, I couldn't figure out what could possibly be so funny about the 
little jerk, and why he had a tiger, of all things, following him 
around, doing equally jerky things to neighbor Suzie and to Calvin's 
parents.  It made absolutely no sense to me, and I was just about to 
write it off as a loss, till one day the paper ran a strip in which 
Calvin was going on vacation with his parents, and had Hobbes in the 
back seat with him - and Hobbes was shown to be a stuffed toy tiger.  
Could'a knocked me over with a feather; up to that point, I had no idea 
that the "live" Hobbes existed only in Calvin's vivid (as it was by then 
made clear to me) imagination.  That single strip not only revealed new 
layers of Calvin (and Hobbes) to me, it also taught me a lesson the 
likes of which the phrase "never judge a book by its cover" could never 
do in its staticness.
I had a similar reaction at one point during "The Tigger Movie": there I 
was, only halfway watching this flick, really thinking ahead to the time 
when I'd get home, get this review out of the way, and get some 
much-needed sleep - then seemingly out of nowhere, I had one of those 
"aha!" moments where things suddenly became incredibly clear to me.  
Maybe it was just a single word spoken; more likely, it happened during 
one of the scenes when the on-screen pages of the book turned as if 
narrator John Hurt was a father reading the story to his children - and 
I was transported back to a place in time where Winnie The Pooh, Tigger, 
Eeyore, and Christopher Robin were as real to me as Hobbes was to 
Calvin.  And as silly as it sounds, that "aha!" moment washed over me 
and made the movie come alive.  It was quite a cool Moment for me; I 
wasn't able to hold on to it as long as I would've liked, but it stayed 
with me long enough to make a difference in the way I watched "Tigger".   
And the best thing about the Great Revelation was, it allowed me to be 
comfortable in the knowledge that even if the 37-year-old me couldn't 
totally relax and let this children's movie be a children's movie 
without the added tres cool wink-nudges that more sophisticated fare 
like "Toy Story 2" had built-in, at least the kid me could appreciate 
the memories of the simple lessons about what family really is, that can 
be be found in "Tigger" and the like.
Once I recovered (mostly) from the "aha!", I was able to sit back and 
enjoy the ride with less distraction (except for the rather loud, but 
cute, kids surrounding me).  Before the Great Revelation, "Tigger" 
seemed to be a fairly run-of-the-mill, not very well-drawn cartoon that 
seemed better suited for viewing on TV; that feeling didn't change much 
- I still believe that it didn't really need to be a theatrical release 
- but the issue no longer was reason enough to not enjoy the movie for 
what it had to offer.  Though most of the Obligatory Disney Songs (and 
what's a Disney movie without Obligatory Disney Songs?) made me stir in 
my seat a few times, I found myself enjoying Tigger's big production 
number; it actually tied in with the general theme of the movie, without 
feeling like a forced fit.  And though its comparatively "primitive" 
artwork can't compete with TS2 in the eye candy department (except for 
one noticeably beautiful shot when the sun shines directly on Tigger as 
he and Roo travel through the 100 Acre Wood), that same primitive look 
is faithful to the artwork we've seen countless times during "Winnie The 
Pooh" TV specials.  Overall, the nostalgic flavor that came with the 
look of "Tigger", worked in its favor.
It's fairly evident that "The Tigger Movie" was probably destined for 
direct-to-video release before other recent animated movies got boffo 
box office results; Hollywood execs, after all, are not known for 
passing up potential bankrolls if they can help it.  And though the 
quality of this movie, from both a graphical standpoint as well as in 
its storyline, isn't quite up to the level of TS2, its lack of 
sophistication, nuance, and "inside gags" didn't stop me from enjoying 
"Tigger" for what it was.  In fact, its honest simplicity made me 
appreciate it for exactly that; the bouncy Tigger, scatterbrained Pooh, 
hilariously deadpan Eeyore, and sweetly vulnerable Roo, wouldn't have 
been the same had they been written as more adult-friendly characters.  
Kids of all ages will appreciate that--but only if they're kids at heart.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Too often, adults let our adulthood get in the way of a good 
old-fashioned bounce (though the way I heard it was, Tiggers Pounce.  
But that's just semantics, I reckon).  Sometimes it's best to drop the 
mask of sophistication and just let a lullaby be a lullaby; sometimes, 
simple *is* better.  To be sure, "The Tigger Movie" was no "Toy Story 
2".  It wasn't really even a "Stuart Little" (as cloying as *that* 
similarly-themed movie was, it did have its Moments).  But maybe that's 
as it should be; there's gotta be room in this world for a Pouncing 
Tigger - and a Roo who loves him - right?
"The Tigger Movie" (rating: greenlight):
Tiggers Pounce.  I can diggit.

    Though it's destined to have a much longer run on the
video shelf than in theaters, this fun-filled, full-length animated
feature follows in the wake of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree
(1966) and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977), adapted from
the classic A.A. Milne books. Who doesn't love Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore,
Owl, Kanga, Roo and - in this case - the ever-exuberant Tigger?
Written and directed by Jun Falkenstein, based on a story by Eddie
Guzelian, it revolves around Tigger's need to find his "gigantically,
stripedy" family tree. Voiced by Jim Cummings, Tigger hunts
boisterously throughout the Hundred Acre Wood, looking for other
Tiggers. But, as he has so often said himself, "The very most
wonderful thing about tiggers is that I'm the only one!" What Tigger
concludes, of course, is that family isn't just about sharing blood
and similar physical features. It's about giving and receiving love
from those around you - providing a good lesson for eager, open young
minds. The narration by John Hurt sounds wonderfully, authentically
British and the animation is not only inventive but amusing. Art
director Toby Bluth has chosen line drawings that hark back to the
original E.H. Shepard artwork.  The colors, the light, and the shading
all reflect the Hundred Acre Wood - a real place that one can still
visit outside of London. While nothing that will go down in the annals
of musical history, the six new songs by Robert and Richard Sherman
(Mary Poppins, Jungle Book) are pleasantly tuneful and one, at least,
is a terrific tongue-twister. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Tigger is a toddler's 7 - it's a cuddly cartoon.

Hollywood has no courtesy to the older actors of their previous time. It seems
that countless films today feature an entire cast under 30 or treat old people
as the running joke, both of these have happened in a handful of films from the
past year. When older actors (or actors over 40) do get really good roles, it's
usually in a small independent picture that will be playing in the dark and
scary section of town in a small theater where you would never dare to go at
night. So let's broaden that phrase, Hollywood has no respect for people in
general. Not to mention animals. Which is why I was very concerned walking into
The Tigger Movie, one of Disney's Thanksgiving to June animated features (much
like The Goofy Movie) that is designed to hold us down until the big Disney
animated opus comes out in June. If Pooh and the gang were treated as a
throwaway film, imagine what that could do to disgrace the entire set of
classic featurettes and the future of the franchise. Fans of Pooh's earlier
adventures (kids and adults alike) will find plenty to be excited about, as
there are only a few things that have changed.
Tigger is feeling energetic, but alas, there is no one to bounce with. While
trying to find a bouncing partner, he interrupts the rest of the gang who are
trying to move a boulder off of Eeyore's house and they inform him that they
can't bounce with him because they are not Tiggers and can't keep up. Feeling
lonely he begins thinking. With the help of one of the six fabulous musical
numbers, he decides that there must be a Tigger family out there somewhere in
the Hundred Acre Wood. A suggestion of a Tigger family tree from Owl is all he
needs to go bounding off into the forest leaving the rest of his friends
behind.
There seems to be a very low chance of finding other Tiggers, so Roo (who tags
along with Tigger in almost all of his daily bouncing and non-bouncing
activities) gets the gang together and they decide on a plan. They will write a
letter to Tigger, pretending to be Tigger's family. This only complicates
things, Tigger thinks the letter says they will be coming to visit him tomorrow
and soon they are painting stripes on themselves and trying to dress up Eeyore
as one of Tigger's relatives.
Not a very complicated plot, but it's not a very complicated movie. The
original drawings of the Hundred Acre Wood were copied with the greatest of
skill and the result is remarkable. The beautiful forest that these creatures
live in always manages to be a feast for the eyes throughout the entire movie.
But there is also a rather large use of actual animation, drawn by actual
hands, in the characters as well. While some sequences are obviously digitally
animated, most of the rough black lines that outline the original cartoons are
still there, as well as a humorous change to the title sequence. Jim Cummings,
who's been Pooh and Tigger on the TV show and in the made-for-video movies does
a great job with his two characters, but the rest of the cast falls short. Even
Eeyore (who makes more amusing comments than ever before) seems to have lost
some of his depressed touch. The film also brings out Roo as a major character,
Roo wants Tigger to be his big brother and his constant idolizing (it's almost
worship) of him is the only thing that bugged me about the movie. Everything
also manages to keep fairly un-modernized while a funny song regarding the
family of Tiggers (that includes a homage to Marilyn Monroe) is sure to please
adults, there isn't much else going on. I kept waiting for Christopher Robin to
say, "Hold on, I have to go check my e-mail." Or, "Let's go play Pokemon
instead." But he didn't.
This one is definitely not suited for a video rental, it's rich colors are
grrreat and it may be the only time you ever see the gang on the big screen.
It's message is easy for children to grasp and kept the kids (and the EXTREMELY
NOISY teenage girls behind me) interested. But if you do need to go to
Blockbuster (or you are searching through your huge closet of movies you own)
take the time to see the original three Pooh featurettes, I bet you won't see
much of a difference. While I know it's cliched to say this, Walt would be
proud.
