First films are usually clumsy, experimental, and uneven. But
43-year-old Erick Zonca has turned the tables with his first film, THE
DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS. Like many French films, THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS
is slow-paced, but the surplus of emotion makes up for the lack of
plot. The film features two outstanding performances from Elodie
Bouchez and Natacha Regnier, who shared the Best Actress award at last
year's Cannes Film Festival, while Peter Mullan took home Best Actor
for MY NAME IS JOE, a similar emotional experience.
The first character we meet in THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is Isa(Elodie
Bouchez), an impoverished drifter with a past we never learn much
about. She wanders into a French city, selling homemade postcards
which she says are for the poor. A man whom she meets in a cafe lets
her have a sewing job in his factory. In the factory, she meets
Marie(Natacha Regnier), a shy woman given to fits of rage. Marie
agrees to let Isa stay at her flat, which she is taking care of for a
woman who was in a car crash with her young daughter. Isa and Marie
become friends, and during a night on the town, they meet
Charly(Patrick Mercado) and Fredo(Jo Prestia), a couple of bouncers
from a nearby nightclub. Charly and Marie are involved until she meets
Chris(Gregoire Colin), a rich playboy who owns the club. It is obvious
that Marie is with the wrong man, and it seems to be tearing her
apart, and slowly she is suffering a nervous breakdown.  Meanwhile,
Isa has begun to read the personal diary of the girl who was in the
car crash, and she begins to visit the child in the hospital, day
after day.
THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS doesn't offer much in the way of a plot, and
it takes quite a while to get going, but soon it's not hard to see
that the film is a study of two characters, and since they are
portrayed so realistically, it's hard not to feel emotionally drained
after watching the film. The filmmaking is sometimes raw, and
sometimes graceful, depending on the mood of the scene. Erick Zonca is
amazingly gifted, because it takes many filmmakers a few films to
create such a sense of powerful immediacy. THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is
a superb, riveting film, and is sure to be among the best first films
of the year.

   When I was younger and wiser and dating girls who had
roommates, I was regularly amazed by how often these pairs
of best friends would split up prematurely.  The rate of
breakdowns of twenty-somethings during the 1960s exceeded
even the current frequency of divorce.  Does living together
ruin friendships?  In many cases this seems to be true.  To
get more insight into the enigma, take in Erick Zonca's
remarkably well-acted and poignant piece, "The Dreamlife of
Angels."  You'd not be at all surprised to know that this is the
work that closed last year's New York Film Festival, featured
not in the usual space but in the majestic and large Avery
Fisher Hall--home of the New York Philharmonic.
   The feature, which allowed the two principal performers to
take best-actress awards at Cannes, is not just a
heartbreaking story of two working-class women who are
barely of age.  It's a portrait of the lives of working-class
women who wile away their wage-earning hours in soul-killing
factory jobs, performing the same monotonous tasks hour
after hour.  This is the sort of film that should boost
enrollment in colleges: only through a decent education can
most young people avoid spirit-busting toil like that weathered
by Marie and her friend Isa, who share a common age and
occupation but who are psychologically very much different.  
   The movie opens in the Northern France town of Lille,
where Isa (Elodie Bouchez), an array of rucksacks on her
back, is peddling religious pictures on the street to make a
few francs.  She strikes up a conversation with a man in a
cafe who is the manager of a factory turning out dresses, and
is offered a job, where she becomes friendly with a fellow
seamstress, Marie (Natacha Regnier).  The two young
women flirt with a couple of bouncers at a club, Charly
(Patrick Mercado) and Fredo (Jo Prestia), and while Marie
enjoys a brief affair with Charly, she is soon both attracted
and repelled by the club's rich owner, Chriss (Gregoire Colin).
The arrogant Chriss smoothly and duplicitously convinces
Marie that he likes her, while Marie ignores her roommate's
counsel that the affair cannot last.
   "The Dreamlife of Angels" focuses equally on the two
young women, portraying the wandering Isa as surprisingly
stable and loving despite her homelessness, but the real
drama accelerates as Marie--already unstable--begins to go
off-the-wall.  She fights on the least provocation, becomes
seldom other than moody, and when her tenuous
relationships begin to fall apart, she becomes desperate.
   Hollywood films exploring the relationship between two
women tend to be overly melodramatic and violent--"Thelma
and Louise"--for example.  The beauty of Erick Zonca's
feature is the more natural performances he culls from two
gifted thesps who, according to the production notes, were
compelled to live together to get the feel of both the intimacy
and the quandary such closeness produces.  "The Dreamlife
of Angels" is a work of accomplished earthiness and sincerity.

DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS, THE (LA VIE REVEE DES ANGES) (director/writer:
Erick Zonca; screenwriters: Roger Bohbot/Virginie Wagon;
cinematographer: Agnes Godard; cast:Elodie Bouchez (Isa), Natacha
Regnier (Marie), Gregoire Colin (Chriss), Jo Prestia (Fredo), Patrick
Mercado (Charly), 1998-France)
Who finds in life what they dream of? This emotionally moving film will
look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working
class girls, doing it in a way only the French can do it justice.
The petite 21-year old Isa (for Isabelle), who is  loaded down with a
full backpack, wanders into the cold and grey industrial city of Lille.
She hopes to stay with a male friend, but finds out he's in Belgium, and
ends up remaining in Lille for the night. She hopes to pick up some cash
by selling touristy postcards on the street, which leads to an encounter
with a Yugoslavian who tells her about a sewing job in a clothing
factory. Isa, being unskilled, gets fired after working there only one
day, but not before meeting a fellow seamstress, Marie (Regnier), who is
the same age.
Isa is someone we think we know but really don't, as she is prone to be
friendly and willing to make relationships, opening her dark saucer eyes
wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go
along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black
hair; but, we are, also, distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her
right eyebrow, which is never explained. There are many things about Isa
that are unexplained and delightfully mysterious that we accept from her
because she is so genuinely likable.
Marie reluctantly puts her up in a beautiful apartment, one that she is
minding for a mother and a daughter lying comatose in the hospital after
a car crash.The mother will die, leaving the teenage girl with no
visitors except for Isa who takes it upon herself to make contact with
the girl in the hospital. These encounters brilliantly show what Isa is
all-about, as she wants to will the girl back to life. For Isa, life
holds so much promise and light and love in it, that misery alone cannot
stop her thoroughly from the angelic path she is on. The journey becomes
for her only a question if her dreamlife can become her real life, as
she will seek the ideal and not be deterred by what roadblocks stand in
her way, which is something the young can do more readily than the
elderly. By the end of the film, we wonder what will become of her, as
the camera pans the sad faces of the women who work all their lives in a
factory, where Isa might have no choice but to end up working in and be
exploited by the bosses, as it seems that is the pattern of life for a
working girl here.
Her relationship with Marie is not a very warm one, instead it is a
workable one. Marie is not a trusting or caring person; in fact, she is
most of the time a downer who expects the worst in life and when that
happens she can't properly handle it without becoming crazy.
The tall and slender Marie is very attractive but she is also very
mixed-up emotionally. Sex is the only thing that can bring her joy in
this world. Her relationship with the more spiritually minded Isa is
based more on convenience than on  mutual admiration or anything else,
since they are both impoverished and seem to be stuck because of their
lack of education and inability to fit into society and their inability
to meet a guy who they love or who can love them in return. They are
working-class girls, seemingly trapped by their birth, unable to get
what they want from life. Each one dreams of a way out; but Isa, as hard
as it is to believe from her appearance, is the one more grounded in
reality, the one better prepared to make a go of it in life, and she is
the one who grows up right in front of us.
Their encounter with the opposite sex comes on their first night
together, as they try to crash a rock concert without having a ticket,
but two rough-looking bouncers keep them out while flirting with them.
The girls are not attracted to the guys and tell them so in a nasty way,
but the relationship changes to one of friendship after much banter back
and forth. Marie ends up going out with the one she insultingly called
fat, Charly (Mercado), and sleeps with him but tells him she doesn't
like him enough to have sex with him (she will have sex with him twice,
on later occasions); while the other bouncer, Fredo (Prestia), is
smitten with the cute Isa, but to no avail, as she is not taken with him
and does not encourage the relationship to go any further than
friendship. The guys feel sorry for the penniless girls; also, they want
to keep up a relationship with them, so they give them some money to
help them out.
The supposed meal ticket and way out of the trap Marie is in comes about
unexpectedly, as she gets caught shoplifting a leather jacket and meets
again Chriss (Colin), she once randomly approached him in the street in
a hostile manner when she was in a playful mood. He pays for the jacket,
which she accepts with hostility. She is someone who is terribly
concerned about appearances and being humiliated, constantly unhappy
about her station in life. He will turn out to be a womanizer, and she
will be one more girl in his series of conquests, but is too blinded by
her own dreams to see this, though all the signs are there. His
nightclub (his father bought it for him) happens to be the place where
the girls' bouncer friends work.
Isa, in need of money, tucks in her pride and takes on the temp job of
dressing like a fool, putting on roller-skates and advertising
sandwich-boards. Marie, however, will not. She can't handle the
demeaning nature of the job.
A steady rift grows between the women, as Marie thinks she's got what
she wants with her relationship with Chriss and doesn't need Isa
anymore, and acts hostile toward her. All Isa is trying to do is clue
her friend into not falling for Chriss, telling her that he will only
drop her when he wants to, these remarks only make Marie more insulting
towards her. There is a classic look of disgust on the face of Isa, that
seems to be saying, you are really sick, when she finally realizes that
she has to move on from here.
The performances of the two actresses was bewitching, as the two women
deservedly shared Best Actress honors last year at Cannes.
The poignancy and merits of the film, are in depicting accurately the
reality of the girls' lives. It is a film without one false note of
sympathy or sentimentality in it. This is not the type of a girl-buddy
movie as seen in some Hollywood films of late, filled with glibness and
glitter and canned experiences. Here, what happens has the ring of truth
to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale,
without trying to be cute or pedantic, turns out to be profound. It
caught a certain inexpressible joy there is to life, the kind of joy
where one can connect with someone else and feel satisfied in doing that
because what you are doing is true, just like Isa did when she
befriended the girl in the coma.
This debut film for the 42-year-old director, done with the austerity of
a master, reminiscent of someone like a Robert Bresson, is a work of
considerable merit. It is a film that not only depicted the shattering
of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class, but
it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the
girls, looking at it in a poetic way.

Being entertained is the purpose that all of us go to the movies. The motion
pictures that fill the screens in your local multiplex shows great adventures
and wonderful romance about five times a day for your viewing pleasure.
Thatâs why it is a rare thing when a film comes along that threatens to be a
movie about the normal (or not normal it is up for you to decide) lives that
people live. We are not talking about only people in America but all around the
world. The French import The Dreamlife of Angels by first time directed Erick
Zonca is just this type of tale. Nothing fancy, no elaborate anything, but
still full of raw, pure emotion. Films like these are rarely, (if ever), made
in the United States. How will US audiences take a movie that wonât excite
them or make them feel happy coming out of the theater? That seems like a
question for this movieâs box office and word of mouth to answer.
Isa (Bouchez) has just begun working at a sewing factory in Lille when she
meets Marie. Marie isnât the type of person to open up to anyone, let alone a
stranger, but the two begin to form a bond of friendship. She invites her to
move into the flat that she is watching over for a mother and daughter who are
in a coma. The girls run about the streets looking for their ideal man and a
good sum of money. 
Isa is obviously much more sensitive and has a much greater amount of empathy
than Marie and begins to visit the girl whom the flat belongs to in the
hospital. One day when Marie tries to shoplift a leather jacket out of a store,
a rich club owner named Chris (Gregoire Colin) rescues her from the police.
Marie fancies Chris until she discovers that he is really a jerk and then rapes
her as payment for the leather jacket. Distancing herself from Isa, she
continues to see the man that has blinded her with feelings of love. The girls
find themselves distancing from one another as their friendship turns into
hatred. 
The Dreamlife of Angels could be re-titled âWhy You Should Go To College and
Get A Good Job.â? The girls do many things in desperation of getting money and
their lives are anything but dreamy. Most of the events showcased in the film
range somewhere between sad, extremely depressing, or just plain horrible. The
acting, on the other hand, is superb, Elodie Bouchez is wonderful as Isa and
has some very emotion scenes that showcase her acting talent. Natacha Regnier
is good as Marie and she does an excellent job with her tough girl attitude
that occupies most of her character. Some of this Dreamlife looks like it was
shot with a home video camera, but it turns out to be OK because the filming
doesnât matter as much as the character development does. The film is
sluggish (the 113 minute running time could easily be shortened to about 95
minutes) and slow in many parts. So I cannot quite recommend it if you are
looking for a fun little movie to watch on a Saturday night. But for those that
are looking for a film with a message that is (somewhat) hard to get, (I am
sure that there are some people like that out there somewhere) rent The
Dreamlife of Angels, it gets ** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains a sex scene with graphic movement. There are
three separate shots featuring bare breasts, a couple is shown in bed after
sex, and there is some strong language. The film is also drenched with
emotional tension. Good Age 15 & Up

     Many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which
the two principals, despite initial appearances that they are a perfect
pair, are destined never to be happy together.  They have been sweet
(ANNIE HALL), sad (CASABLANCA), even sordid (9 1/2 WEEKS); indeed, they
have come in virtually every possible permutation.  THE DREAMLIFE OF
ANGELS is the first film I can recall which traces the arc of a platonic
friendship in the same terms.  Sparked by two superb performances in
complex roles, it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the
doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals.
     The two pals in THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS meet while working at a dress
factory in the French city of Lille.  Isa Tostin (Elodie Bouchez) is a
21-year-old itinerant stranded without a place to stay when the friend she
has coming looking for is nowhere to be found; Marie Thomas (Natacha
Gregnier) is a hard-edged woman living for free in the apartment of a
woman and her daughter severly injured in an auto accident.  Marie invites
Isa to stay with her, and the two kindred free spirits quickly become
inseparable.
     The dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset
only because they are so carefully, beautifully drawn by Erick Zonca and
Roger Bohbot.  The punky Isa and hair-trigger Marie click from their first
meeting, two rebels without a cent who delight in taunting bouncers at a
local nightclub or coming on to random men in a mall.  Their playful
irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes, and allows the two lead
actresses to develop a believable chemistry.  That kind of chemistry is
critical to a story about a relationship -- if Isa and Marie don't seem
like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted, the rest of THE
DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS becomes utterly irrelevant.
     It's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves
deceiving, and the film works just as well revealing that truth.  Where
Isa is sincerely searching for someone with whom she can connect, Marie
consistently sabotages every stable thing in her life.  Isa finds the
diary of the comatose teenager whose room she is occupying, and begins to
visit the girl in the hospital while manufacturing a dialogue with her.
Marie, meanwhile, dumps the chubby but loving Charly (Patrick Mercado) for
the callow, abusive Chris (Gregoire Colin), and refuses to put forth an
effort to land another job.  Though the psyches of the two women are
perhaps too easily distilled into a brief discussion of their respective
parentage, Bouchez and Gregnier flesh out their roles as opposite sides of
the same wounded coin.
     The character study of THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is so strong that it's
easier to overlook its short-comings:  a drawn-out prologue before the two
women meet, under-developed supporting characters, and a third act which
takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn.  Zonca's minimalist direction
never gets in the way of the performances, but it also does little to
complement them.  In fact, the story might have worked even better as a
two-character stage play.  That's not to take anything away from the
effectiveness of those characters in the film, or the skilled actresses
who bring them to life.  It's a thoroughly compelling exploration of
female bonding and un-bonding, a "chick flick" turned on its head.  The
disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic.

THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is basically a simple slice-of-life story told
at a leisurely pace.  Twenty-one year old Isa (Elodie Bouchez) comes to
the town of Lille in the north part of France to be near her boyfriend
only to find out he is out of the country working on a construction
job.  With no money and no place to live she barely makes enough to feed
herself by cutting pictures from magazines and turning them into
greeting cards and religious decorations which she sells on the street
claiming the proceeds are for charity.  She spends her time freeloading
and getting into trouble.  For a few weeks she lives without a home
begging from strangers.  During a stint in an abortive attempt at a job
in a sewing factory she befriends Marie (Natacha Regnier) and moves
into an apartment that Marie is looking after for Sandine, a comatose
woman that neither Iso nor Marie has actually met.  Marie feels little
gratitude to Sandine, but Isa feels some responsibility to their
unwitting benefactor and spends hours in the hospital reading to the
unconscious Sandine.  Isa and Marie meet and make friends with two
working class men, Fredo and Charly (Jo Prestia and Patrick Mercado),
who do security at concerts and work as club bouncers.  The two remain
only occasionally romantic friends.  But then Marie meets and gets
involved with Chris (Gregoire Colin), the attractive young owner of two
up-scale bars.  Isa does not think much of Chris and believes that Marie
is reaching beyond her station.  She is certain that Marie will only be
hurt in the end.
Though not nearly as disturbed as the woman returned from the dead she
plays in J'AIMERAIS PAS CREVER UN DIMANCHE, Bouchez plays Isa as punk
and sassy, yet with a sincere and caring core.  Isa lavishes hours of
care and attention on Sandine, but shies away from receiving any
gratitude for the effort.  Regnier plays Marie as a romantic in spite of
herself, lacking either in free will or sense.
Erick Zonca, who co-wrote the screenplay as well as directed, has given
us a detailed and three-dimensional picture of two very marginalized
women.  His Isa and Marie just get by, frequently by stealing, with very
little thought for the future.  They are not the most likable
characters, but they are probably much like women that can be found in
any city.  Zonca does not romanticize and makes little attempt to
excuse, but they are very believable and very real people.  One is
reminded both of THE 400 BLOWS in the earlier parts of the film and of
"La Boheme" later.  His deliberate pacing may well end up being more
frustrating in the US than in his native France.  And it would be one
thing if the pacing were used to add depth to the characters.
Frequently they are involved in some activity that tells us little
about their character beyond that Isa is not particularly fastidious
with her nail polish.
Overall there is really about a half-hour or perhaps an hour's worth of
story here spread thinly over 113 minutes.  While the title is not quite
as sarcastic and bitter as ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE, this is not a world
to which the viewer may want to contribute so much time.  I give the
film 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS (Sony Pictures Classics)
Directed by Erick Zonca.
         The mark of a truly good movie isn't necessarily how much you
enjoy it while you're sitting in the theater (or on the couch, as the
case may be) but how you feel about it days or weeks later. A popcorn
extravaganza like "Wild Wild West" may help to kill a couple of hours on
a hot day, but it doesn't exactly sweeten in the memory, and if you
suffer through a truly bad film you want to start forgetting the
experience as quickly as possible.
 "The Dreamlife of Angels" is a truly fine piece of work that's
certain to linger in your mind for quite awhile. You may find the
central characters a little hard to warm up to -- neither of them is
likely to be mistaken for Julia Roberts -- but their experiences, their
friendship and the difficult lessons they learn are genuinely haunting.
 "Angels" is the story of Isa (Elodie Bouchez) and Marie
(Natacha Regnier), a pair of young women fending for themselves in a
dreary corner of France. Isa sells handmade postcards when she's in
between menial temporary jobs; Marie toils in a sweatshop and lives in
an apartment that belongs to a hospitalized mother and daughter.
Eventually Isa moves in with her and the two begin to find the
fun-loving, girlish parts of their personalities they've been forced to
suppress, probably for years. They begin hanging out at the mall, trying
to crash concerts and flirting playfully with anonymous guys. It's a
fulfilling friendship and, since this is a French film, you can rest
assured it won't last.
 Before long, Marie, who initially seemed like the brighter of
the two, has fallen hopelessly for Chris (Gregoire Colin), a slick
womanizer who owns some clubs and dazzles her with his seemingly
limitless supply of cash. Isa sees through Chris and tries to steer her
friend toward a less well-heeled guy who truly adores Marie. Sadly,
Marie's self-esteem is so low she'd rather sneak away for a few
afternoon trysts in a motel room with Chris than consider spending time
with someone who might actually treat her with respect.
 Using decidedly unglamorous locales and stars, director Erick
Zonca has given the story what amounts to an almost documentary feel;
Isa and Marie seem so true-to-life at times you might feel a bit
voyeuristic. "Dreamlife" is also a movie less concerned with plot than
it is with details and character development. The waifish Isa ultimately
becomes wise and self-sufficient while the more domineering Marie
gradually collapses from the inside out. Bouchez and Regnier so
brilliantly get under the skin of these women and provide them with such
vivid personalities that by the end you feel you've known them for
years.
 Every so often Hollywood tries to Americanize French movies,
generally unsuccessfully. Let us pray no one hires Liv Tyler and Alicia
Silverstone to re-do "Dreamlife": That would truly be a nightmare. James

In THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS (LA VIE RĘVÉE DES ANGES), Isa (Élodie
Bouchez) and Marie (Natacha Régnier) are two twenty-year-old women who
lead an itinerate lifestyle.  Rarely with much money, they go from one
odd job to another.  They meet at a sewing job, something for which
neither of them is particularly well suited.   Isa, who carries all of
her possessions on her back, talks Marie in letting her stay in the
apartment in which Marie lives temporarily until its owners come back.
Since both of the owners are in a coma after a car accident, it isn't
clear when, if ever, they will return.
The bleak and surprisingly thin story has the two women form a modest
bond due to their similar circumstances.  Besides being without funds,
both grew up in unhappy homes -- Isa because her parents broke up and
Marie because her parents didn't.
In a story in which almost nothing happens until the last scene, we do
learn much about Isa's smoking techniques.  First-time director Erick
Zonca, who shares the writing credits with Roger Bohbot, apparently
believes that people reveal much about their character by the exact
manner in which they smoke.  Although both women share a nicotine habit,
Zonca uses repetitious tight shots to dwell on Isa's proclivity.
Isa, with her fingernails always partially covered with old nail polish,
likes to grip her cigarettes as if she is trying to crush them.  She
prefers long drags that suck in her checks, and she follows them with
vigorous exhales of dense smoke.  After every third puff, she
ritualistically picks off a tobacco particle from either her lip or
tongue.  I have yet to decode the precise significance of these
mannerisms, but given the screen time devoted to them, they must contain
important symbolism.
The title is essentially a misnomer.  The story has little to do with
angels or dreams, although a subplot does have Isa sitting in the
hospital with the apartment owner's comatose daughter and reading from
her diary.  Most of the movie is devoted to Isa and Marie's relationship
and to Marie's sex life.  A troubled and angry woman, Marie acts like
she is going to slug the men she meets but ends up going to bed with
them instead.  Sex with Marie can be rather like a wrestling match.
Character-driven movies like this succeed based on how compelling the
characters are, and neither of the leads here ever manage to draw us
into the story.  The director makes especially uninspired choices in the
staging.  Besides his obsession with the intricacies of smoking, he also
features a segment on the washing and drying of a backpack.  The result
is that, at the end, when the film finally tries to engage the audience,
we've long since lost interest.
"You've been moping around all week," Marie complains to Isa during one
of their mild spats.  This is the exactly the problem with the movie.
It mopes around most of the time with not much to say.  Oh well, at
least the two actresses do show promise even with such bland material.
THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS runs 1:53.  The film is in French with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would probably be an R for sex, nudity
and profanity.  The movie would be fine for older teenagers.

First time director Erick Zonca's The Dream Life Of Angels (La
Vie Revee Des Anges) is a grim, warts and all study of female
friendship.  But, unlike most formula driven Hollywood efforts, there
are no terminal diseases or unrealistic, melodramatic plot devices to
test the limits of friendship.  Rather, Zonca opts for an intense
level of gritty realism that will satisfy many in the audience who are
looking for something a little different.  The film explores realistic
and credible characters, emotions and conventional situations with an
honesty that is rare in today's cinema.
Twenty year old Isa (Elodie Bouchez, from Andre Techine's Wild
Reeds, etc) is a drifter, who lives a hand to mouth existence as she
travels across France.  When she arrives in Lille, an industrial town
in northern France, she lands a temporary job in a sewing factory.
She is ill-equipped to handle the job and after a couple of days is
fired.  But at the factory she strikes up a friendship with fellow
seamstress Marie (Natacha Regnier), a taciturn and introverted loner
with a rebellious streak.  Isa moves into Marie's flat.
It turns out that Marie is merely minding the flat for a woman
who was recently hospitalised following a car crash.  Isa and Marie go
out a lot, party hard and drink a lot.  The two eventually develop a
friendship with a couple of bikies, who also work as bouncers at a
local night club.  But when Marie begins a torrid affair with the
handsome but shallow night club owner Chriss (Gregoire Colin), the two
friends begin to drift apart.  Isa can see that Chriss is merely using
Marie, but her friend is reluctant to accept the fact.
Meanwhile Isa herself becomes obsessed with the comatose
daughter of the flat's owner.  She visits the girl in the hospital and
reads to her from her diary, hoping to make some sort of connection.
Their various obsessions begin to drive the two women apart.  What is
also interesting is how the increasingly strained relationship also
changes their character.  We watch how Isa grows in confidence,
strength and assurance while the fragile Marie falls apart.  The two
girls chain smoke their way through the film with such passion that
one can almost smell the cigarette smoke wafting through the cinema.
This sombre character driven piece is driven by the
sensational pair of emotionally draining and insightful performances
from Bouchez and Regnier.  The two actresses have jointly shared a
number of international best actress prizes for their performances
here, but it is Bouchez who beautifully carries off the more demanding
and showy part.  Zonca apparently had the two actresses share a flat
during the making of the film to give an air of realism to their
relationship, and it shows in the increasing air of tension and
acrimony that develops as the film unfolds.
The pace is slow, and Dream Life Of Angels seems to go for
much longer than its 113 minutes running time would suggest.  This is,
at times, a fairly bleak and down beat film that probes deeply into
the makeup of its two central characters.  The early portions are
tempered with some welcome doses of humour, but the tone slowly
changes as the film continues.  There is little let up from its
claustrophobic and depressing atmosphere in the second half.

SUPER FEATURES:  The riveting, and astounding pair of leads. Acting rarely
comes better than this. Career roles for the two ladies.
(Seen at the 22nd Portland International Film Festival, in Portland, Oregon)
 Liking this film may be hard. But there is one thing that is astounding in
it and exceptional that is hard to dismiss. If the script did not have it,
at least the two women about whom this film's story is centered is too well
written and developed to make this film not liked, or not enjoyed.
 It is not a difficult story to tell. Isa and Marie meet at a deadend job
and they strike up a friendship, and Isa ends up sharing the place that
Marie is house sitting for a period of time. As much as they seem to become
friends, there are way too many differences between them, and no sooner do
they begin living under the same roof that things begin to take off.
 Like many French films, this one is also extremely dependant on the
dialogue. The old saying that French pictures are too talky is still true
here, but in this case, it is hard to do without it, and little in the
dialogue between the two women seems to be wasted. The chemistry, when
things start to go wrong is fiery and so explosive that we may get
exasperated wondering how is this all going to end.
 For reasons that are not really clear, but just happen, Isa begins getting
interested in the people that lived in the apartment, the mother having died
and the daughter in a coma. Isa's curiosity finds many things that come to
interest her, specially the diary of the girl. Isa decides to visit the girl
in the hospital, and eventually the film gives us the indication that it was
Isa's care and interest that helped the girl in a coma improve.
 While this is happening, Marie is entering into a very abusive relationship
that is not helping things. She is becoming hopelessly in love with a guy
that she knows does not care about him, but he is learning to enjoy herself
with him, and this may be the one thing that will break her inner anger and
loosen her satisfaction. Her happiest moments are towards the end of the
film, when she has her high hopes and it appears that things are improving.
But her choice of a man, is a bad one, and it leads to a very sad end.
Amidst the two ladies, is a pair of bikers, one of which comes to like
Marie, but unfortunately she is pretty indifferent to him, and eventually he
sadly has to let her go. They work as bouncers and tour with a band, the
distance of which is rather difficult for Marie. Isa, maintains her
independence, and never gives in to a relationship, with the exception of
her curiosity and attention to the girl in a coma. If Isa's inner need is
one of sharing affection and giving it away, Marie's is the needy one who
must have the affection that she needs to tame her indomitable spirit.
 And the film allows the two ladies to really tear up the screen with some
amazing acting fireworks. Marie has a temper. But Isa, will not back down at
all, and she maintains her own sense of self and independence. Strength,
even if she can not define it, is not something that she lacks. But she at
least has enough sense not to get involved in a relationship that has sex in
it, probably because she is guarding her own emotional state. Her appearance
is not clear, but we have the sense that she just came off a relationship
that left her guarded and protective of her space.
 The largest merit in this film is without a doubt the interplay between the
two ladies, who make the film move forward. It's the redeeming factor in
this film. Acting does not come any better than this, and the way that
things are shot around them is actually pretty well done, considering that
fiery acting work not done at a distance is not always advisable. In this
film, the directorial choice to go ahead and stay near them, is a
magnificent add on to the two characterizations that these women develop.
 Probably the downside of the film is its rather downtrodden ending,
suggesting that Marie and Isa are not the only two women that are alone and
unsatisfied in this world. The panning camera looking at other faces
immediately seems to suggest that any one of these could be another Marie,
or Isa. This, in of itself, is more than likely a statement about what the
country is making of people as workers than womanhood itself, but it really
is a sad end, compounding a sad end already.

THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS (LA VIE REVEE DES ANGES, France, 1998) *** 1/2
Directed by Erick Zonca. Script & dialogues, Zonca, Roger Bohbot, Virginie
Wagon. Photography, Agnes Godard. Editing, Yannick Kergoat. Sets, Jimmy
Vansteenkist. Music,Yann Thiersen. Cast: Elodie Bouchez (Isa), Natacha
Regnier (Marie), Gregoire Colin (Chriss), Jo Prestia (Fredo), Patrick
Mercado (Charly). A Bagheera production (Paris). A Sony Pictures Classic
release. 113 minutes.  Rated R (sex)
It's a French film. A very good French film. A very French French film.
And, to boot, a first feature by a Frenchman, then 42, with a rather
unusual name that more often than not misspelled:  Eric, Erik, Erick,
Zonka, Zoncka, Zonca. His background is unusual too. Born in Orleans in
1956, while still in high-school he decided to become a filmmaker. He moved
to Paris at age 16, discovered American cinema, took acting lessons,
survived via odd jobs. At age 20 he moved to New York, spent three years
there, survived via odd jobs, married a dancer from the Merce Cunningham
Company, took more acting classes, discovered European (including, very
much, French classical cinema). Back to Paris for two years' study of
philosophy and more odd jobs. At age 30 he entered movies as an apprentice.
He then became an assistant, later directed TV documentaries and, beginning
in 1992, three short films, all successful on the festival circuit. But
glory seldom comes from shorts.
It arrived with a bang when Dreamlife and its makers received a slew of
nominations at the 1998 Cannes Festival, where its two protagonists shared
the Best Actress prize. Ms Bouchez, a veteran of many films, is in
increasing demand, and was in another, very good film at Cannes, also a
first feature called Louise (Take 2). Ms Regnier is a newcomer. At the 1999
Cesar awards (French Oscars), the movie was Best French Film,  Elodie
Bouchez Best Actress, Natacha Regnier Most Promising Actress. At the
European Film Awards, Mr. Zonca won as European Discovery of the Year, the
two ladies as Best Actresses. At the Viennale, the movie was The
International Critics Association's choice.
Dreamlife has no plot by Hollywood standards. A penniless drifter, the
rather petite 21-year old Isa (for Isabelle), carrying all her possessions
in a huge backpack, wanders into the industrial city of Lille in Northern
France. She hopes to stay with a male friend, finds out he's left town,
somehow spends a cold night in Lille (there are tiny clues that it is the
post- Christmas season). Her attempt to pick up some francs by making
postcards from magazine pictures leads to a casual encounter (a marvelous
Yugoslav who has a daughter her age) who finds her a sewing job in a
minimum wage clothing factory. Isa's skills being zero, she gets quickly
fired, but not before meeting a co-worker, Marie, also 21.
Hesitantly, Marie puts up Isa in "her" good apartment, one that she is
minding for a mother and a daughter who, after a car crash, are comatose in
a hospital. By degrees, Isa and Marie form a  friendship--in fact more
camaraderie than affection-- though having impecunity in common are
otherwise different from each other. Isa, who flashes generously her big ,
dark eyes and a sunny, toothy smile (Ms Bouchez's trademark), is adaptable
and comfortable with her ambulatory life. We learn only little about her
past. A scar over an eyebrow (apparently put there at Bouchez's suggestion)
keeps catching our eye and making us wonder how it got there? Violence
against Isa? A tomboy accident?
Pretty unsinkable and optimistic, she recalls a bit Godard's My Life to
Live, in which Nana (Anna Karina), forced to survive through prostitution,
still thinks that life can be beautiful. But unlike Godard, Erick Zonca
will not analyze, philosophize, expatiate or ask the incessant questions
that hallmark Godard's work. Dreamlife is entirely "what you see is what
you get."
There's also a strong, loving streak in Isa. She discovers and reads, in
the apartment, the diary of Sabine, the daughter. Next thing you know, she
is visiting regularly the vegetable-like Sabine at the hospital (the mother
had died) where she speaks to her as if in the belief that this will help
her get well. It's a wonderfully touching invention .
At the other extreme, slender, taller Marie is are rebel with  a huge,
misanthropic chip on her shoulder. (It is later explained partly by her
background, partly as the not unusual dissatisfaction among the French
working class). Isa, strictly from hunger yet laughingly takes on the very
temp job of dressing ridiculously (in the cold street), putting on
roller-skates and advertising sandwich-boards. Marie, however will not. She
is not amused. She thinks, correctly but impractically, that this is
demeaning work. She is always very conscious of the humiliations of life.
Yet she's also capable of fun and games.
Trying to crash ticketless a rock-concert, the girls are blocked by two
tough-looking bouncers (and bikers), thin Fredo and corpulent Charly. What
starts as antagonism ends up as sweet friendship, which extends to Marie
sleeping--but not having an affair --with Charly. She's keeping her options
open.
The main option comes in the person of Chriss (sic), a young man who is
what the French call "papa's son," a spoiled fellow whose family has bought
him a night-club (the very one where the bouncers work) and more. What
really matters here is that Chriss is a cad. When Marie is caught
shoplifting, he rescues her. In spite of her hostility extending also to
him, she yields, goes to bed with Chriss, begins a short-lived but
calamitous relationship which is punctuated by very real humiliations,
which is never explained, in which stages of abandon alternate with  stages
of clenched teeth. One thing is fairly clear: that Marie herself does not
know what she feels except that the wealthy man will be her ticket out of
misery. How naive.
The Chriss business puts a wedge between the girls. Isa, who at first
seemed to be a lightweight in the brains department, proves to be
realistic, perspicacious and anxious to open Marie's eyes to her
self-destruction. It all falls on deaf, hostile ears...
The movie is beautifully made in all respects, and with a strong sense of
economy of means. Photography is done smoothly with super-16 cameras which
allow for flexibility, the following of characters, and a near-documentary
look. Style, script, editing, acting, real sets too are under the sign of
economy as well as palpable intimacy in the collaboration of all involved.
The film is not manufactured, instead,  it records life. It also bucks the
contemporary trend of movies begetting movies, of the past-
movies-awareness that was the gift to us by the French New Wave but went on
to become mere fashion (viz. Tarantino and hordes of Sundance-ish films).
Here movie-consciousness does not replace life-consciousness. There are no
riffs on past pictures. Yet Dreamlife is eminently French.
For one thing, it is character and relationship oriented. For another, it
deals with the working class, which diversely gets labeled as proletarian,
blue-collar or low-class. The paradox (a staple of French cinema), is that
the rich, petty bourgeois Chriss is in reality very low-class ethically.
Clearly too, the classic French cinema that Mr. Zonca paradoxically
discovered in New York, has marked him. He updates the "poetic realism" of
(mostly) the 1930s with its stream of "Popular Front" movies that
celebrated loners among the common men and women, that had their own streak
of "miserabilism," and that never quite came to a halt. Witness some of
Robert Bresson's works and, even closer to our day, Agnes Varda's Odyssey
of a female drifter in Vagabond (1985).

Susan Granger's review of "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS" (Sony Pictures Classics)
        In French with English subtitles, 42 year-old Erick Zonca's
first feature film revolves around two young working women of
contrasting temperament who meet as minimum-wage seamstresses in a
garment factory in the city of Lille, in northern France, and sustain
each other for a brief time out of necessity. Elodie Bouchez plays
Isa, a scruffy, spike-haired, happy-go-lucky gamine who travels with
her rucksack from city to city, taking odd jobs where she can find
them. Natacha Regnier plays the edgy, moodier Marie, who views the
world as bleak and perpetually clouded. Both come from broken
homes. Neither possesses marketable skills nor has a support network
of any kind. The strength of the film lies in its poignant, soulful
compassion and its stirring evocation of their raw, desperate daily
struggles, particularly with the men who use them for their own
selfish needs. While the plot is deceptively simple, the script is a
bit incoherent, and the pacing is definitely European, the charismatic
actresses are superb. Deservedly, they shared the Golden Palm for Best
Actress at last year's Cannes Film Festival. Parental Warning: this is
an adult film with nudity and intense sexual content. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "La Vie Revee des Anges" or "The Dreamlife of
Angels" is a gray, grimly realistic, yet delicate 7.  For those who
admire the art of acting, it may be worth the price of admission just
to marvel at the fully-realized, bracing performances.

The Thumbs For Sale! Review by Roger Gerbig
With the impending arrival of that Star Wars flick, these Thumbs! felt
obligated to travel down the dark alley theat bypasses the multiplex,
snakes its way past dozens of dumpsters, and ends somewhere in the
vicinity of France--that mythical place where they do indeed make
better films than cars.
"The Dreamlife of Angels," a big winner on the international
film-festival circuit, lets us in on the lives of Isa and Marie
(Bouchez and Regnier, who shared the best actress award at Cannes last
year), two young women who seem to be in between most
everything--jobs, apartments, boyfriends, and quality time spent with
family. Theirs is a tentative existence, filled mostly with mass
consumption of tobacco products and a staggering lack of bigger plans.
Isa's just arrived in town and discovered her one prospect has taken
off for the greener pastures of Belgium. After bedding down for a
night in a freezing abandoned restaurant, she wastes no time looking
for an establishment with central heating. Despite apparently being
perpetually down on her luck, her toothy grin, steely resolve, and
sparkling eyes that instantly remind us of alien autopsies past land
her a job in a matter of hours.
Once employed at a local clothing factory, she befriends Marie, a
quiet girl who's content to hang out in the wings and roll the fattest
cigarettes in the history of nicotine addiction. Turns out Marie's
housesitting a cozy flat while the owner and her daughter recover from
comas obtained in a tragic car accident.  Refreshingly, this dual coma
plot device is as outlandish as the movie gets. For the next hour and
a half, we watch as the women's friendship develops, matures, and
nearly vaporizes. Often with the French, you're never quite sure if
their films are low budget, filmed to look low budget, or are really
documentaries masquerading as narrative fiction. In "Angel's" case
this has a lot to do with the oft-handheld camera, unadorned lighting
and the complete and total lack of melodrama (and for many, many
minutes lack of just plain drama).
Yet it's never boring, which is a testament to the fact that director
Zonca doesn't let the story unfold. Rather, he allows it to develop at
a pace consistent with what his characters can realistically bear. Nor
does he waste our time filling us in on the minutia of their
motivation and behavior. Like your friends, family, and yourselves,
they sometimes just do things that momentarily evade explanation.
For instance, Marie gets involved with Chris (Colin), a rich kid who's
obviously practicing to become a classic philandering Frenchman (and
scoring high marks, I might add). Why they are drawn together is never
fully explained. Sure, judging from his selection of pastimes, I can
see why he might be interested in taming a feral child, but is this
the whole story? I don't think so. As for Marie, she makes a living
out of asserting her complete and total independence, yet who do you
think's running off to the beach house for a weekend of wet sand and
bliss?  Likewise, Isa visits the comatose daughter at the
hospital. While she maintains a certain element of curiosity in the
beginning, when asked she can't provide an answer why she keeps going
back. Trust me when I say there are many more facets like these to
ponder both in real time while watching the film, and later.
With "Dreamlife", Zonca makes his full-length feature debut well past
the age of 40. His years of documentary filmmaking clearly leave their
mark here, yet this isn't any "NYPD Blue" affair. Though the camera is
handheld in many scenes, make no mistake, this is an exercise in
subtlety. Everything from pensive moments bathed in the soft bluish
light of the perpetually overcast sky, to fierce lovemaking captured
by an intrusive cameraman hovering just above the action are captured
in whichever style feels most honest. But like the plot, adjustments
from scene to scene are a matter of only a few degrees. Everything
stays on course and well within the realm of plausibility.
If I appear to be repeating myself, it's because I want to drive a few
underlying points home. Having these points illustrated allows you to
focus on the myriad of other details present on screen, not to mention
more time to take in the subtitles. While I feel I had quite a
meaningful experience with this film, I'm not entirely sure
why. But having so few conclusions drawn for you by the filmmakers
makes deciphering your experience all that more rewarding.  Folks, the
laserblasts heralding the beginning of the summer silly season have
arrived. For a quality calm before the storm (or respite), I can't
recommend this flick highly enough

The Dreamlife of Angels (1999)
A Capsule Review by Nathaniel R. Atcheson
Copyright 1999 Nathaniel R. Atcheson
        The Dreamlife of Angels features two masterful central performances. 
The first comes from Elodie Bouchez, who plays Isa, a young and friendly
drifter who can't keep a job.  The other performance is by Natacha
Regnier, playing Marie, a slightly more-stable woman who befriends Isa. 
The film centers around the relationship between the two women, and also
their individual struggles; Marie becomes obsessed with a womanizer
(Patrick Mercado), while Isa becomes strangely attached to a young girl
in a coma.  With a strong sense of artistic ambition from director Erick
Zonca, The Dreamlife of Angels is an affecting and sharply realistic
look at two pathetic lives.  My only real complaint is that the movie
comes to a screeching halt in the last twenty minutes, and then putters
to a denouement that comes dangerously close to anti-climax.  Overall,
the picture serves best as a showcase for two amazing young actresses.
