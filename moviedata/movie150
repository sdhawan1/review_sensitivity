"Isn't it exciting?" the lithe and beautiful Alice (Natacha Régnier from 
THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS) asks her virginal boyfriend, Luc (Jérémie 
Renier).  "Our adventure.  You used to complain that nothing happened."  
Loading the body of a high school classmate, Saďd (Salim Kechiouche), 
whom they just murdered into the trunk of the car, the numb Luc isn't 
likely to be griping about the lack of excitement ever again.
Writer/director François Ozon's CRIMINAL LOVERS (LES AMANTS CRIMINELS) 
is a dark, dark psychosexual fairy tale for adults as written by the 
Brothers Grimm, as in VERY grim.  It is an erotically-charged morality 
tale with the message that actions have consequences and horrific 
actions have horrific consequences.  
At first, we aren't sure why these two young lovers have killed Saďd.  
Is it just for sadomasochistic sexual gratification as it certainly 
seems?  Using flashbacks, we learn from Alice the reason why she feels 
that she deserves to enact revenge on Saďd, but how credible is her 
version of the truth?  And will we ever come to know the exact events 
that led her to take another's life with such premeditated viciousness?
After asking the shocked Luc if he loves her and getting no response, 
Alice goes off with Luc to bury Saďd's body in the woods.  Along the way 
they stick up a jewelry store, but Alice wishes they had held up the 
bakery instead since she's hungry.  This is a girl with a very twisted 
sense of morality.  She cries profusely for a rabbit that they run over 
but has no sense of remorse over slicing up a human being like a piece 
of meat.  What is clear is that she gets her sexual kicks from perverse 
activities.  
Filmed beautifully and scored well musically, the picture alternately 
invites and repulses us.  The most sickening scene turns out to be the 
skinning of a rabbit, as its flesh is ripped off its body.  It is the 
type of movie that, the more you describe it, the more your readers want 
no part of it.  But this is a fascinating film with chillingly 
believable acting.  And with plenty of surprises along the way.
The second part of the story happens after our young lovers have buried 
Saďd's body.  Lost in the woods, they happen upon the remote cabin of an 
ogre.  They figure that they are quite invincible and can easily rob 
food from him.
Instead, this man, listed in the credits only as the man in the forest 
(Miki Manojlovic), proves to be a one-man vigilante squad.  He throws 
them down into a dark basement inhabited by rats and Saďd's decomposing 
body, which the man has unburied.  The man says he has cannibalistic 
intents on them, liking his girls skinny and his boys fat.  This means 
that Luc gets stuffed like a goose while Alice starves.  Homosexual rape 
is just one of many terrors that he inflicts on his prisoners.  Suffice 
it to say that they would have been much better off if the police had 
found them first.
If ever there was a movie that isn't for everyone, it's CRIMINAL LOVERS.  
But if you find really dark sexual thrillers intriguing, CRIMINAL LOVERS 
may be the picture for you since they don't get much darker or more 
erotic than this.
CRIMINAL LOVERS runs 1:30.  It is in French with English subtitles.  The 
film is not rated but would probably be NC-17 for nudity, language and 
strong sexuality and violence, including rape.  It is for adults only.

Thanks to a growing catalog of disturbing short films, François Ozon has
been dubbed `the bad boy of French cinema' and his latest, Criminal
Lovers, will do nothing but bolster his claim to that crown.  The film
is a sick, twisted and, at times, terrifying blend of Natural Born
Killers and Badlands, with a little Deliverance and Hansel & Gretel
thrown in for good measure.
Lovers opens with a sexually aggressive student named Alice (Natacha
Régnier, The Dreamlife of Angels) playing a nasty prank on her impotent
boyfriend Luc (Jérémie Rénier).  But this trick isn't the only one
playful Alice has up her sleeve.  She also convinces Luc to help her
slaughter an Arab classmate named Saďd.  The scene is graphic and the
two killers seem strangely indifferent as they try to clean up the
bloody murder scene.  The teens hit the road, with Saďd's body in their
trunk, stopping only to rob a jeweler and exercise the five-finger
discount at a supermarket.
The murder occurs about ten minutes into the film, before we really
learn anything about either Alice or Luc.  You may begin to scratch your
head and wonder who these kids are and what exactly led to this crime
spree.  Don't worry - Lovers is told via flashbacks in this uniquely
structured film.  What you might want to worry about is the frightening
incident the teens experience upon stumbling on an isolated shack in the
woods when they bury their classmate's body.
Ozon's cold direction (he also wrote the script) might leave some people
shaking their heads and accusing him of attempting only to shock, but
you can't deny that Ozon is a brilliant, stylish filmmaker.  Lovers is
only his second feature film, and the world should both anticipate and
dread his next project.
1:30  Not Rated but contains adult language, nudity, strong sexual
content,
rape, graphic violence, canibalism and a scene featuring a rabbit
skinning

        She's a mouthy, demanding, bratty femme fatale who always wants her own
way. Her cuckold is a slightly goofy young fellow who hangs on her every
word and submissively goes along with whatever scheme she cooks up.
These are our unsympathetic heroes in Francois Ozon's latest exercise in
cinematic shock treatment, Criminal Lovers. 
        After a preliminary scene in bed where the girl, Alice (Natacha
Regnier, unrecognizable from The Dreamlife of Angels), mouths off to the
boy, Luc (Jeremie Renier), taking a photograph of his limp penis and
threatening to mail it to his mother, they commit a violent crime.
Without fully knowing their motive, our title characters meander into a
high school shower and stab their jock classmate Said (Salim
Kechiouche).
        Taking it's cue from the Coen Brothers' recently re-released Blood
Simple, they proceed to get rid of the body by wiping up the blood and
dragging the canvas wrapped body out into the middle of the woods to
bury it. Ozon dwells on their first major obstacle, fully observing how
difficult it is to rid themselves of the corpse.
        Thrillers should really grab you in the first fifteen minutes. It's the
crucial time where we meet the characters who you'll be following for
the duration of the film. The biggest problem with Criminal Lovers is
that Ozon has created two characters who are downright annoying to be
with for ninety minutes - she's completely obnoxious and rude to the
boy, berating him with every word. He's a simpering weakling who sulkily
takes it on the chin. They're nasty and dull, a poor combination. 
        Things heat up when they get lost in the woods. Before you can say
"modern retelling of Hansel and Gretel, they're kidnapped by a natty old
forest hick (creepy Miki Manojlovic) who locks them in the basement.
What follows are drawn out scenes of the wood ogre demanding that Luc
bathe him and have sex with him, just for starters. The worst, of
course, is yet to come. Why do you think he's fattening Luc up? What do
fairy tale ogres do to their victims?
Intercut with these relentless scenes of torture are flashbacks of high
school as Alice and Luc plan their murder. Far from illuminating the
crime, they make it trite because each twist involved in their scheme is
telegraphed so far in advance through the obvious dialogue that there's
no satisfaction in those elements of surprise. The viewer is forced to
sit and wait for the inevitable "moment of shock" where we see that
"everything is not what it seemed to be."
A good hour of the movie is devoted to the ogre and his child as they
spend time developing their sado-masochistic relationship while Alice
seethes in the basement demanding food. You quickly become used to the
wood ogre pushing Luc around, and soon realize that this is going to be
the movie. The youngsters aren't going to escape for several reels, so
we're treated to long takes of "wash my hairy back" or "my turn to wash
your back." Since Ozon so clearly wants to titillate and shock his
audience, the effect wears off as his well of continuous thrills runs
dry.
The grand finale is utterly ridiculous on every level, as Ozon winks and
nudges as the action takes place, asking the audience for a pat on the
back to acknowledge how clever he is to make fun of the lovers engaging
in their moment in the spotlight. With his numerous cutaways to animals
peeking in from the forest and the bright, shining music, you can almost
hear Ozon say, "Aren't I being so clever with my use of irony?" 
Pretentious schoolboy drivel. This is the type of movie which gives "art
house cinema" a bad name.

CRIMINAL LOVERS (LES AMANTS CRIMINELS)
Once Francois Ozon's daringly explicit films See The
Sea, Sitcom and Water Drops on Burning Rocks hit the
European mainland, he was immediately dubbed "the bad
boy of French cinema".  After suffering through the
over-the-top, downright disturbing Criminal Lovers, I
am convinced that Ozon is trying too hard to live up
to his new title.
Criminal Lovers is the type of film that would never
be made in post-Columbine America; it's a Natural Born
Killers in which the killers are under 18.  Alice
(Natacha Regnier), the femme fatale, is a promiscuous,
manipulative bitch whose actions are merciless.  As
the film opens, she persuades her naive boyfriend, Luc
(Jeremie Renier), to help her kill a smug,
good-looking classmate as an act of love.
After the murder is committed, in an empty gymnasium,
the couple flees to the forest to bury the body, and
is kidnapped by a scruffy woodsman (Miki Manojlovic),
who promises to make them suffer for their sins.  He
is the type of man who won't feed Alice because he
likes his women "thin and crispy", and drags Luc
around on a short leash, literally.  Needless to say,
his torture tactics, which involve cannibalism and gay
sex, are not fun to watch.
However, the scenes in the woods are inter-cut with
flashbacks that lead up to the murder, and explain why
it was committed.  The flashbacks are, in their own
way, fascinating, but the more we learn about Alice,
the more we want her to die a bloody death herself. 
Despite all the potentially interesting things Ozon
has to say about the psychology of the characters and
the anatomy of a murder, one can't help but see the
proceedings in an exploitative light.  He claims that
he wanted Criminal Lovers to feel like a fairy tale,
but he must have forgotten that fairy tales aren't
about gratuitous violence and homosexual rape.
Criminal Lovers turns into a rather pointless
psychosexual affair, downright disturbing and equally
creepy.  Regnier ("Dreamlife of Angels"), Renier ("La
Promesse") and Manojlovic (most of Emir Kusturica's
films) are all fine actors, and have done little to
deserve roles in Ozon's B-movie horror-show.  In an
age when the Farrelly Brothers rule the box office and
John Waters is no longer shocking, Francois Ozon has
found new ways to unsettle an audience.  If that's
talent, then so be it.
