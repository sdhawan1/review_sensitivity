Sometimes it can be fun an interesting to watch a documentary about
someone you've never heard of.  Of course, now I feel embarrassed --
apparently this Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg is a virtuoso violinist that
everyone knows.  They even did a piece on 60 Minutes about her.
Well color me a fool.  Described by music critics as "frightening" and
"posessed" while she played, the story of the borderline-crazy Nadja
reminds one of another virtuoso: David Helfgott, immortalized in SHINE.
Through present-day interviews plus archival footage of her practices
and concerts, we get to see what those music critics were talking about:
Nadja is a nutbar when she's playing the fiddle.  And she's good, too.
All of this would be humorous were it not for her accidentally lopping
off part of her pinky and later attempting suicide (the gun jammed).
And two weeks after the suicide attempt, she played Carnegie Hall.
I'm not sure what lessons we can learn from Nadja's life, but her story
(a breezy 73 minutes at that) is an interesting one.
