The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle (1980) 104m.
One of two documentaries about seminal punk rock band the Sex Pistols 
released in 1980, one year after singer Sid Vicious died of a heroin 
overdose (the other being Lech Kowalski's D.O.A.).  If you didn't know 
anything about their rise to fame you'd swear you were watching a SPINAL 
TAP-style spoof on a fictional band.  That's because first-time 
writer/director Julien Temple treats his subject with wild, footloose
humor.  He mixes fictional narrative, archival footage, animated 
sequences, offbeat characters, and video clips of the band's most 
well-known songs.  Before the end the film's reflexivity is layered on a 
little too thick, part of the reason why some viewers may find it 
tiresome.  Others will just find it unwatchable, either because of
the film's puerile approach (the sex, profanity, and violence will 
ensure that it's never shown on television) or because of the subject 
matter itself.  Others may object to it on principle: that Pistols 
manager-cum-shyster Malcolm McLaren is having a big laugh at everyone's 
expense.  McLaren begins the film by enumerating the steps to make money 
through exploitation and demonstrates how he was able
to manufacture a phenomenon from scratch.  The Â‘swindle' isn't only 
perpetrated on record companies that were duped (for a time) but also on 
consumers that bought into a trend that was arguably either anticipated 
or entirely fabricated by McLaren.
For those unfamiliar with the McLaren/Pistols story, SWINDLE provides an 
insightful primer: it pointedly illustrates the role of music in the 
music industry - i.e. it is negligible.  Here is a document that proves 
all the cynics right - that it is only product that matters.  McLaren is 
completely at ease before the camera, making us even
more distrustful of him.  He admits his ulterior motives with such 
cheerfulness that we get the feeling we can't believe anything he says, 
even when he's letting us in on his formula for success (his ten-point 
plan looks like it has been constructed retrospectively and not 
conceived beforehand).  Film's wackiness gets labored in the last 
fifteen minutes or so.  Really, it would have been just as funny if 
Temple had played it straight and let this absurd story speak for itself 
(for example, when the Pistols played their first US tour, McLaren sent 
them straight to the heart of redneck country).  The Pistols' music 
actually holds up pretty well.  Or is that a sign that new trends sound 
even worse?
