Synopsis:
>From the title you might imagine THE SPANISH PRISONER is about a
mysterious American who is unjustly trapped in a Spanish prison and must
use superior wits and gut-level instinct to escape ruthless tormentors.
But actually THE SPANISH PRISONER has nothing to do with either Spain or
prisoners. It's a con game tale whose focus is not so much on the
battle, but on details of the con, and the soul-less-ness of society.
THE SPANISH PRISONER is written and directed by David Mamet, a Pulitzer
prize winning playwright who views cinema as an extension of live
theater. Mamet is known for making frequent use of artsy soundbyte
Shakespeare dialogue. He often uses theater as a medium for advancing
social commentary and scathing indictments of societal superficiality.
The actual plot:
The term Spanish Prisoner refers to a popular con game, which is
mentioned in passing by characters in the movie. The main character Joe
(Campbell Scott) is a brilliant scientific inventor and a resourceful
scout, to the extent that he still keeps his trusty boy scout knife with
him. But in this situation Joe is the exact opposite of clever and
resourceful. For example, when people ask him to carry a suspicious
package through airport security, he willingly obliges: twice. Joe
accepts money not knowing where it has come from, and buys an extremely
expensive item for a blind date whom he has never met. Nor can he decide
between dating a sexy coworker or hanging around with a bath-robed male
acquaintance. Joe's missing acumen makes him an easy target for
materialistic con artists, who try to separate Joe from a precious
secret formula book which he keeps in his office safe. Will Joe be
spared? 
Opinion: 
Chicago playwright and writer David Mamet won a Pulitzer Prize for
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS (1984). He is known for distinctive themes which
permeate most of his work: the theme that society is hypocritical and
superficial; people are insecure and confused, and; people hide behind
rituals and meaningless dialogue to mask their insecurities. Mamet uses
live theater to express this view. The easiest way to recognize a Mamet
work is to examine the dialogue, sometimes described as absurdist. Here
are some examples from THE SPANISH PRISONER: 
Joe: "Funny old world." 
Joe's secretary: "Funny old world? Dog my cats." 
I am just as confused as you are, by "dog my cats." That's the style. In
THE SPANISH PRISONER Mamet takes a mediocre con game yarn, removes most
of the information to make the plot seem more mysterious than it is, and
then replaces real life dialogue with trademark Mamet-style dialogue - -
line where characters interrupt each other with meaningless, nonspecific
mantras right before anyone is about to reveal useful information.  
>From the beginning we can easily see the victim, the prize, the bad
guys, and the fact that Joe is being scammed. And we expect the dialogue
to fill us in on what's happening. But Mamet surprises us. Instead of
regular speech the supposedly ordinary characters spout cryptic
witticisms evocative of a wistful David Niven and a shot of cognac.
Typically, instead of yelling "get me to a hospital" an injured
colleague says, "I put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains." 
In my opinion, this kind of dialogue is done on purpose, because,
Mamet-type main characters usually are written as inwardly insecure. The
cryptic dialogue symbolically represents the fact that people don't
really listen to each other; they merely parrot bland generalities and
false wittiness to mask their inadequacy and unhappiness. Thus
conversation is largely superficial 'dog my cats' stuff, mixed in with
some philosophical barbs and ritualistic tongue-in-cheek toe-the-line
generalizations.
Meanwhile we in the audience don't really know anything about main
character Joe's character at all because his actions are deliberately
inconsistent. Joe cannot decide between a man and a woman. He cannot
decide whether to be ambitious about his job or whether to sit back. He
can't decide whether he wants money or doesn't want it. In fact, the
only solid constants are that Joe's society is corrupt and that Joe is
clueless about the obvious con taking place. This cluelessness continues
about an hour - - the length of time it takes for Joe to perceive what
the audience knows in the first five minutes. Then THE SPANISH PRISONER
quickens a bit, and finally the movie tosses in a good ending - - except
for a flippant explanation of the mastermind.
In a lot of movies one thing which makes a movie amusing or entertaining
for the audience is watching the cat and mouse game between the
antagonist and the protagonist. Usually it's a battle of power, wits,
luck, and strategy between evenly matched contestants or mismatched
contestants where one opponent has grossly underestimated the other. THE
SPANISH PRISONER has no such battle: Joe is completely outclassed by the
cons who have not underestimated him at all. 
A different director such as Alfred Hitchcock would have given Joe some
valiant suspicions and a few sharp and exciting attempts at
investigation or battling back. But here Mamet's cinematic assertion is
that characters - -  however confidently disguised and no matter from
what strata of society - -  are for the most part confused. 
As a medium for delivering dark social criticism, THE SPANISH PRISONER
succeeds artfully.

     In David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER, Campbell Scott stars as
mathematical genius Joe Ross who has developed some unspecified
industrial process that will allow whatever company has it to rule some
very lucrative market.  He is presenting his process and his estimate
of its probable value at a special meeting with his company's
executives.  The setting for this meeting is a luxurious Caribbean
island.  As part of his reward he is told to enjoy the resources of the
island for a couple of days at his company's expense.  While there he
strikes up a friendship with Susan Ricci (played by Rebecca Pidgeon), a
company secretary who shared his plane to the island.  Photographing
her he also accidentally photographs Jimmy Dell (played by Steve
Martin), a well-to-do man of mystery.  Dell has the odd talent of being
irritating one moment and ingratiating the next.  Jimmy asks Joe to
deliver a package to his sister on his return and the twisty plot is
off and rolling.
     This is a fun film, one that ties up the viewer in many mysteries
of who is doing what to whom.  Just what is going on is different
depending on who really is Joe's friend and who is only pretending to
be.  This could be a clever story with a little rewriting to the
script, but it is not a script whose plot bears too close scrutiny.
There are holes and there are some very unlikely assumptions on the
part of the plotters in this film.  If one does not absolutely insist
on a plot credibility of story, the film is a reasonably tangled
puzzle.
     Scott and Pidgeon are sufficient in the main roles, but neither
has a lot of screen charisma.  As is often the case, the interesting
characters in a Mamet film are in the peripheral roles.  Steve Martin
is a surprisingly good actor given that he started his career as a
counter-culture stand-up comedian and his film career as the star of
the dim-witted THE JERK.  He has long since proven that he can do much
better than that.  Here he has the suavity of a Cary Grant and
tremendous personal magnetism.  He is magnetic even when he says things
like "Always do business as if the person you're doing business with is
trying to screw you, because he probably is.  And if he's not, you can
be pleasantly surprised."  The rest of the cast is just fine.  It is
particularly good to see Ricky Jay, sleight-of-hand artist and sometime
actor.  He is extremely natural on the screen and is almost the
trademark of a David Mamet film.  Speaking of Mamet trademarks, with
David Mamet directing there is nearly always a few scenes in which the
actors deliver their lines in a total deadpan in an extremely affected
style. I am not sure why Mamet does this, but you can almost always
find a few such scenes.
     While none of the plot twists should be entirely unexpected for
the viewer, this is as much a game as a film to see and to pick apart.
I would give it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale, and a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.

I promised myself I'd go on vacation. I promised myself I wouldn't watch a
single film while I was away. Come to think of it, I also promised myself I
wouldn't write a single movie review. Yet somehow here I am, typing away.
This is because, of course, of Truth About Life #196: Not Rules, but
Resolutions are meant to be broken. Now nine times out of ten I end up
regretting promises I break to myself, but this time just happens to be
different. Case in point: The Spanish Prisoner.
I guess I could describe the Spanish Prisoner as the ghost of Alfred
Hitchcock (alive and well inhabiting the body of director David Mamet) come
back to haunt us with an insane dark wit, a smart enigmatic mystery, and a
surreal game of murder and falsehood. I needed my vacation. I needed a
thriller I could enjoy without wanting to tear to shreds on the first try.
In the words of the little girl in Poltergeist "It's he-re!"
I'd like to give you an opinion on the performance of Steve Martin in his
first serious role. I'd like to give you an opinion on the innards of its
plot. And, you know what, I'd really like to give you my ideas on the exacts
of what happened, let you in on the little tricks. But that's just mean.
And, as a critic, I'm supposed to be mean to the film... not to you. I can't
tell you anything. Or rather I could, but then I'd have to kill you. Come
on, it's a breech of rules: like holding up the peace sign all through the
movie Scream or talking during the picture. You just don't do it.
I guess vacation would have to have the prerequisite of relaxation, which
this movie isn't, keeping you smartly on the edge of your seat with
something different each second, taking you in directions that you didn't
really know existed and still ending up the same place half of the time.
It's a ride. And not only is it a ride: It's a ride you take at Six Flags,
travelling super-fast and not knowing where you are. But then you hit the
end, and it's all explained. Or is it?
You know what? Why don't you find out?

Don't look for a Spanish prisoner in David Mamet's new film, The Spanish
Prisoner. There isn't one...but, that's the point.  In this intricate
thriller, nothing is quite as it seems...or is it?
Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) thinks he's on the verge of hitting the big
time.  He's just invented a complex financial formula called The
Process, which could mean huge profits for his company.  His boss, Mr.
Klein (Ben Gazzara), has promised him due compensation at the next
stockholder's meeting, but his friend George Lang (Ricky Jay), a company
lawyer, advises him he should get something in writing, or he might get
screwed.
Thus do Joe, George, Mr. Klein, and Susan Ricci (Rebecca Pidgeon), a
company secretary who has a crush on Joe, travel to a Caribbean resort
island St. Estephe to sell The Process. While there, Joe meets a
mysterious businessman, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), who befriends him and
begins to give him worldly advice.
But then, things begin to fall apart, and the overly-trusting Joe begins
to have doubts.  Is anyone really who they seem?  Is Joe being played
for a sucker?  If so, who is out to get him, and who can he trust?
David Mamet's complex plot is well constructed, and full of myriad
twists and turns.  The whole film is pleasantly reminiscent of
Hitchcock. However, under strict analysis, the film doesn't quite hold
up that well (there are too many convenient coincidences).  But it's
still leagues ahead of most thrillers.
Campbell Scott does an excellent job of pulling in the audience.  His
overly nice character could have been off-putting in a cynical world, or
even been seen as a weakness.  However, he manages to imbue Joe Ross
with a strong everyman quality which makes him likable despite his
flaws.
Steve Martin is the film's most welcome surprise.  In a mostly dramatic
role, he delivers a delightful performance, with just the right amount
of edge to be slightly unnerving.
Of the cast, the biggest disappointment has to be Rebecca Pidgeon. Her
stiff delivery is the film's most significant detraction.  Whether it
was either a conscious character quirk, or a result of
over-memorization, her flat and precise delivery lets you know there's
an actor at work... shattering the veil of disbelief.
Thankfully, she has a wonderful script (written by her husband, director
Mamet, no less) to build it up again.  There may be flaws here and
there, but for the most part, they work within the context of the film,
and only truly make themselves known during reminiscence.

Starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Steve Martin, Ricky Jay, Ben Gazzara,
and Felicity Huffman.
I was originally going to give The Spanish Prisoner two and half stars. From my
first viewing, I noticed that David Mamet's film was intense and clever at
times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning. From
my second viewing however, I noticed that Mamet's script was actually a
masterpiece. The Spanish Prisoner, like The Usual Suspects or Chinatown, begs
for the viewer's complete attention. Miss a scene or even a small detail, and
you could miss the meaning of the entire film. Also like the aforementioned
films, it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising
and memorable ending. Mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987
when he wrote and directed House of Games. Like his past gem, The Spanish
Prisoner fools the audience as much (or even more) than the victim. Because we
were deceived just like the victim, we feel a strong attachment to the main
character and consequently are more interested in the film. Mamet has the
talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped, but rather leaving some
ambiguity towards the end. The power that he has in forcing the viewer to
determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over, without
giving a right answer, is unique and ingenious. The Spanish Prisoner will leave
you seriously puzzled and intrigued. After seeing the film again, I noticed
that the details Mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening. His
direction is very subtle; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going
on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is
happening even if you see all of them, or think you see all of them. 
The story follows a young up and coming businessman, Joe Ross, (Campbell Scott)
who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "process" that everyone is
trying to get their hands on. Soon Ross does not know who he can trust or who
is after his "process." Through his journey Ross meets a number of mysterious
characters: The rich and popular Jimmy Dell, a secretary who has a huge crush
on Ross, and Ross' boss Mr. Klein. Played by Steve Martin, Rebecca Pidgeon, and
Ben Gazarra respectively, the supporting cast is very solid especially Martin,
who deserved an Oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role. The
most interesting character in the film, though, was Campbell Scott's Joe Ross.
The character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a
paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable. 
David Mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually
talk like the characters in the film, yet we feel so connected to some of them.
His beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge. This is a must
see, for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie.

      "Who in this world is what they seem to be?  Who?" asks secretary
Susan Ricci, played with sweetness and innocence by Rebecca Pidgeon, to
her would-be boyfriend and coworker Joe Ross.  As Joe, Campbell Scott
from THE BIG NIGHT has to be wary of everyone in THE SPANISH PRISONER.
"You never know who anybody is, except me," Susan reassures him.  "I am
who I am."  Well, maybe.  You can never be sure in this fascinating
labyrinth, written and directed by David Mamet in his unique and highly
literate style.  (The title comes from a famous confidence game, or so
the movie claims.)
     Mamet, whose most recent screenplay was the incredible WAG THE
DOG, has given us a host of brilliant pieces of writing, from the more
popular ones like THE VERDICT and THE UNTOUCHABLES to the even better
art house films such as THINGS CHANGE and HOUSE OF GAMES.  It is the
latter picture that comes closest to the plot and tone of THE SPANISH
PRISIONER, and HOUSE OF GAMES, being his best film ever, is the one
most deserving of inspiring another.
     Mamet, who has come up with a few miserable scripts, THE EDGE
being his worst, generally does his best work when he is both the
writer and the director as he was also for HOUSE OF GAMES.  His best
films, THE SPANISH PRISONER being one, are characterized by dense
dialog in which the actors speak in staccato voices, constantly
interrupting each other and sometimes completing each other's
sentences.  More like poetry than prose, the words and the situations
of his movies are like Impressionist paintings.  They make strong
statements, but don't attempt a completely realistic approach.
     A good example of this is Joe's office at a small firm.  As the
inventor of a "process" that turns out to be worth a fabulous but never
disclosed sum of money, he is required to take extraordinary security
precautions.  These include, not only a locked door, but a heavy
curtain to cover over the invaluable process notes which he keeps on
his blackboard.  The details of the process are written in a paper
notebook and kept in his office in a safe, which is hidden behind an
oil painting.  This computerless environment is completely divorced
from modern reality, and yet works marvelously well in the context of
the story.
     Joe works for a boss named Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara), who is
straight out of a Dilbert comic strip.  Never saying what the company
will give Joe for his discovery, Mr. Klein keeps promising to talk to
the board about it.  "If we all do our jobs, we will each be rewarded
according to our just desserts," Mr. Klein claims, not very
reassuringly.
     Steve Martin plays a mysterious, rich tycoon named Jimmy Dell.
Jimmy offers Joe $1,000 for his camera in their first meeting since Joe
has taken a picture of Jimmy and a married woman who, Jimmy claims, is
a princess of an obscure country.  Felicity Huffman, as FBI agent Pat
McCune, is hot on Jimmy's trail.  But why?
     Among the many delicious scenes is one in which Jimmy discovers
that poor Joe doesn't have a numbered Swiss bank account.  He sets him
up with one and deposits 15 francs in it.  Jimmy says this will give
Joe great prestige since people will be able to find out that he has
one, but no one will be able to determine its value.
     That there will be a scam to get the process from Joe is clear
from the beginning, but Mamet takes the entire first half of the story
to meticulously set everything up before the con begins.  And when Joe
inevitably gets the rug pulled out from under him, the movie yanks it
hard and long.
     In a sequence that could serve as a metaphor for the entire story,
when one of the Japanese tourists speaks, she isn't a tourist after
all, but a native Texan.  She says her few lines with a thick hillbilly
accent,.  Even in picture filled with surprises, this one manages yet
again to remind us that things indeed are far from what they seem in
THE SPANISH PRISONER.
     THE SPANISH PRISONER runs 1:52.  It is rated PG for thematic
elements including tension, some violent images and brief language and
would be fine for kids age 10 and up.

No one is what you think they are. That is the basis of The Spanish 
Prisoner, a new film by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright and sometime 
director David Mamet. This psychological thriller has the makings of a 
big-time, whamm-o production, but still comes off as a rather small, soon 
to be forgotten picture. Which is too bad because it has a lot of bright 
spots. Belive it, Steve Martin is a bad guy, a rich guy, and not too 
funny. He is the mystery man who charms his way into techno-inventor 
Campbell Scott's life, and attempts to ruin it.
Scott's character, Joe Ross, has made a brilliant invention for his 
company (the details of which we never learn) but begins to feel slighted 
that he will not be monetarily rewarded for it. As his disappointment 
grows he becomes entangled in a web of mystery that is spun by enigmatic 
millionaire Martin (Jimmy) and a secretary for the company, Susua, played 
by Rebecca Pigeon (writer/director Mamet's real-life bride).
The Spanish Prisoner begins to take on the feel of David Fincher's The 
Game, as the lead characters from both are surrounded by uncertainty (as 
is indeed the audience) and they lose control of the events in their 
lives. But Michael Douglas portrayed a sense of frustration and 
helplessness that Scott was either unable to, or instructed not to convey 
to the viewer. As things get more and more out of hand, I never saw pain, 
frustration or terror in Scott's face. Though it is a good performance, 
the strength of The Spanish Prisoner is found in the extremely "Mametian" 
script, the refreshing performance by Martin, and the suspense 
and mystery that I, personally, could not help but fall into.
There are, of course, a number of coincidental happenings that allow the 
story to continue, and they, as much as anything else, make the film 
completely unoriginal, but it still mangages to deliver. The devices are 
just crafty enough to make it work. But I have a feeling that you will 
need to go out and see The Spanish Prisoner rather soon if you want to 
catch it on the big screen. It just has that feel.

The Spanish Prisoner (written and directed by David Mamet, 1998)
        If David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER is not the best film of the 
year when it's time to party like it's 1999, 1998 will have been a 
phenomenal year for the cinema.  This film is a carefully woven tale, a 
tapestry of deceit sown in the wonderful dialogue of David Mamet, who has 
taken a break from the writer-for-hire chores of THE EDGE and WAG THE DOG 
to both pen and direct a new masterpiece about con artists.
        And con artists is the perfect term.  The confidence game to 
which Joe Ross (Campbell Scott, son of George C.) falls victim is nothing 
less than an artistic and aesthetic masterpiece; you applaud each of the 
game's twists even as you feel for Ross, an Everyman trapped nearly every 
step of the way.  The beauty of THE SPANISH PRISONER is that even if you 
are one step ahead of the con, you still are not sure exactly how it will 
play out, what the ramifications are, or how Ross will react.  There is 
always an extra step, and always an extra element to each step.  THE 
SPANISH PRISONER certainly keeps one on one's toes.
        Any plot information is too much; it is best to enter the film 
without expectations about any character.  It is evident quickly who the 
victim will be; what is not evident is who exactly is playing who and 
how.  Suffice to say that there is a lot of money at stake; suffice to 
say that the MacGuffin of the day is a mathematical uberformula dubbed 
The Process; suffice to say that if The Process falls into the wrong 
hands there will be hell to pay for Joe Ross; suffice to say that The 
Company will watch Ross and The Process very carefully.
        But no one is careful enough in The Spanish Prisoner.  No one is 
careful enough because almost no one is who they claim to be.  Everyone 
acts to one degree or another, everyone deep in facades and masquerades. 
There is a sinister menace in a world where an innocuous summer 
conversation alters one's life.  Everyone's acting, everyone wants 
something, everyone's out to con everyone.  Mamet does not spare us one 
moment of the menace, and we are all a lot richer for the experience.

SPANISH PRISONER, THE (director/writer: David Mamet; cinematographer:
Gabriel Beristain; cast: Campbell Scott (Joe Ross), Rebecca Pidgeon (Susan
Ricci), Steve Martin (Jimmy Dell), Ben Gazzara (Klein), Felicity Huffman
(Pat McCune), Ricky Jay (George Lang), 1998)
A great labyrinth plot, ala Hitchcock, as Mamet delves into the greedy
corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter
competition, and dangles this world in front of us, with all its perks
and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate
types. This nearly perfectly executed film, never fails to surprise and
it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one
explicit sex scene or one single curse word, earning it a PG rating. The
chink in the story's armor is, when you see how it ends, you realize it
doesn't add up. The fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not
in the story itself making sense.
This is a masterfully crafted thriller for the '90s and its new values
and lingo. Steve Martin (that's right, pal) steals the film with his
stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his
persona. The film's theme incorporates how corrupting the corporate
world is for a boy scout like Joe Ross (Campbell), who invented 'The
Process,' and just wants what is his, what he earned by the sweat of his
brow. This something, 'The Process,' is what should put him figuratively
on 'easy street.' 'The Process' is a McGuffin, a Hitchcock invented
term, it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it
really is. Its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do
with a formula that can control the global market. But what Mamet really
is showing, is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin.
This is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how
much they will earn from investing in it and Joe writes the supposed
astronomical figure on a blackboard, which the audience is not
privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the
response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members.
Joe's boss, Klein (Gazzara), plays him along without telling him how
much he will receive for his invention, which is making Joe quite antsy.
While on a business trip to a fictitious Caribbean island that is
supposed to be for the wealthy and Japanese honeymooners, Joe Ross meets
a couple of folks on this island who will alter his life. One is a woman
who says she is an F.B.I. agent (Felicity). The other is the mysterious
rich man Jimmy Dell (Martin), who is seen departing from a boat and
could have also come off a seaplane, when Joe takes a snapshot of him
and the girl he is with. Dell offers to buy the camera for a $1,000, but
when Joe just gives the camera to him and turns down the money, a
friendship starts.
The story twists and turns, as Dell and Joe make plans to meet back in
NYC, with the innocent hero dropping off a package to Dell's attractive
sister, who Dell shows him a photo of to lure him into making sure they
meet again. Joe is like those heroes in '50s noir films who find
themselves alone, fighting both the system and the criminal world. After
meeting with Dell and being duped into opening a Swiss bank account and
being made a member of a phony diner club, and having his world turned
upside down, as he gets involved in things that he doesn't understand,
he is left confused and unsure of what viable choices he has left, as
his pride is hurt that he has been taken for a sucker. He is being
wrongly accused of a crime and not being able to find anyone to trust,
except for his friend and company lawyer, Ricky (Lang). But he is found
dead in his room, leaving Joe once again isolated and afraid. This pulls
him very close to the audience, as they identify with him and his
situation, even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever
be in such a position.
This is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen
to anyone in today's work place, especially to someone who doesn't play
the corporate game, and who doesn't know that the first axiom in
business for the dishonest types, is always do business as if someone is
trying to screw you. So, when he reluctantly teams up with Susan Ricci
(Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who is the new secretary in his firm,
the audience can understand this weakness in him, which is viewed as the
kindness he shows to others. This stance he has, as the outsider who
made good in a world where the odds are stacked against him, but is now
having the rug pulled out from under him, makes him begin to be
uncertain of everything, as he begins to lose trust in people. And as he
wants to be a believer in people, he is drawn to Ricci, seeing in her
someone who has a crush on him, and even though he is not attracted to
her, he needs to confide in someone in whom he can trust and she seems
to be giving him sound advice.
There is no point in giving away the story; that is, except to mention
that "The Spanish Prisoner" refers to a scam. Mamet tells us it is the
oldest scam in the books. In this film, it has nothing to do with Spain
or a prisoner.
This tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together.
It is eerie because the innocent hero asks, during one of his low
points, "Why steal what others worked for?"
Mamet offers a naive plea for the corrupting influences of big business
to stop their venal behavior, as he wonders why those who play fair
always get eaten up by those who don't.
It is a film that earnestly asks, `Why is it that nobody in this world
is what they seem?'
And that is a question we can all relate to in one way or another, as we
are led along the same blind alleys Joe is, seeing the same things he
sees, wondering if this Kafkaesque nightmare has a light at the end of
the tunnel.
Has Mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and
leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted?
And the answer is... Maybe. This is a film for people who like to use
their noodle and are able to appreciate films that can't be tidied up so
easily. Even the so-called tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it

There's a scene towards the middle of David Mamet's "The Spanish Prisoner"
where the protagonist, Joe Ross (Campbell Scott, sans Stanley Tucci for a
change), discovers that everything he did in the first half of the film
will get him in a whole lot of trouble he may not be able to squirm his way
out of.  The big deal with this is it took me off guard as well.  Viewing
this film is like viewing two films which work hand in hand: one's an
interesting film where we see a working man get the taste of hobnobbing
with a rich yet somewhat creepy businessman; the second is like something
out of a Kafka story.
In fact, "The Spanish Prisoner"'s second half really resembles last year's
amazing David Fincher flick, "The Game," where a cynical business man had
his life toyed with by an unknown assailant.  I remember that film as being
incredible fun, yet having so many plot holes that it could not be taken
seriously (just for the record, I'm not holding that against it at all: it
was more like artistic liscence than some really bad slip-up on the
writers' part, and it was one of the best films of last year).  "The
Spanish Prisoner" is a lot like that film, although its first half is so
subtle that the second half comes off as a huge shock, almost as much as it
is for the character.
"The Spanish Prisoner" is an art house, low budget thriller, as much as I
can see, that deals with several frightening nightmares, such as knowing
that what you've done in your past will doom your future, not being able to
escape evidence of something you did not commit, feeling like everyone is
against you, and not being able to wash blood off of yourself.  Mamet, as
the screenwriter (as well as director) picks a totally innocent character
as the poor guy to take the big gradual fall, and surorund him with a wide
assortment of characters who may or may not be working against him,
although it's impossible to detect until it's too late.  It's a film that
twists and turns and leaves the audience leaving with a big smile, knowing
that you've survived an intelligent rollar coaster ride of a flick.
But before I go on, let me recap the plot: a hard-working business man,
Joe, travels to a Carribbean island with his working pal, George (Ricky
Jay, who was recently the cameraman from "Boogie Nights"), and his new very
blunt secretary who has a thing for him, Susan (Mamet's wife, Rebecca
Pidgeon), and there runs into a mysterious rich man, Jimmy Dell (Steve
Martin, in a performance so eerily subtle that it just may be his best
acting in a film), who befriends him, and carries on the friendship later
on in New York.
After about an hour of this, the film takes a weird 180 degree turn, and
the film suddenly becomes frightening and crazy.  It's nothing like the
events that happen to Michael Douglas in "The Game," like being shot at, or
being trapped inside a runaway taxi.  It's more like things that seem so
subtle that it's pretty understandable that Joe would not be able to see
them ahead of him.  And there are no plot holes (or "artistic liscences"
for the plot), giving this film a more realistic and scarier feel, mostly
because the events could happen to anyone,  which is extremely effective in
creating tension.
But the really amazing thign about this film is how the first half, which
seems kind of boring while you're watching it, never gives any sign of the
second half coming along.  Some may call this being choppy and dock points
from the film; others (like me) realize that this was essential in creating
an effective second half.  This is not like "The Game," but is really an
intelligent, realistic, and playful film which attempts to toy with the
audience the same way that Joe is being toyed with by showing no one's
perspective but his, and thus taking us off guard as well as him.
If you don't know who David Mamet is, he's one of the best writers working
today, not only writing films (his most recent jobs where for "Wag the Dog"
and "The Edge," and he has directed other films of his own, like "House of
Games," to which this has been compared), but also award-winning plays like
"Glengarry Glenn Ross" and "American Buffalo" (both which have been made
into films).  His dialogue is some of the best written, not because it
sounds realistic, but because it is so playful and easily defines the
characters who speak them.  Here, his dialogue is in tact (some lines are
definite intelligent quotables), but he also shows that he's a master at
plotting.  "The Spanish Prisoner" unfolds brilliantly, shocking us at every
twist and turn, and never insulting our intelligence (it should also be
noted that this film is PG, which shocked the hell out of me, especially
after seeing the "fuck"-fest that was "Glengarry Glenn Ross" - guess he's
trying to expand his horizons or something).
And as with many other Mamet films, the acting is superb.  Campbell Scott
is stiff, but so's his character, and he's easily sympathetic.  Rebecca
Pidgeon delivers a witty performance, all the more admirable as the film
goes on.  She has several scenes where she's so straight forward that it's
comical.  Ricky Jay, who's becoming more and more prominent in films lately
(in addition to "Boogie Nights," he also played a small role in the latest
Bond flick, "Tomorrow Never Dies," as a computer hacker), perfectly speaks
the language of Mamet (which is like a whole other kind of dialogue, kinda
other-worldly).  Also, look for Al Bundy himself, Ed O'Neill, in a one
scene role which is surprisingly effective.  Glad to see him working again
since the cancellation of his, um, show.
But shockingly enough, the actor who really steals the show is...Steve
Martin.  As the subtlely creepy Jimmy Dell, he oozes with a shocking
greatness, and a knack for really fleshing out Mamet's dialogue.  Martin's
an excellent comic actor, but, like Robin Williams, he seems to also want
to show that he can do very effective dramatic leg work as well.  And like
Williams, he's amazing, restraining all his wild and crazy antics, and
turning in a performance which is just plain fun to watch, and even comical
in a different way than he's used to.  He's not great because he's Steve
Martin doing drama; he's great because he's amazing.
But the real star of the film is Mamet, who designs the film so well that
it's probably the most effective and just plain entertaining films of the
year thus far.  It's the kind of film where you shake with the protagonist,
experience all their scares, and come out just as drained as the hero does.
 And when a character nightmares become the audience's nightmares, well
that's a film that has really become effective.

Directed by David Mamet.
Cast: Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Steve Martin, Felicity Huffman, 
Ben Gazzara, Ricky Jay, Ed O'Neill.
1998 - 110 minutes.
Rated PG (for brief violence).
Reviewed October 24, 1998.
David Mamet's "The Spanish Prisoner," is a puzzle of a film, one that 
starts off simply enough but begins to stack story development upon 
story development, and twist upon twist until we really actually have to 
be paying close attention to be able to follow everything. This is not a 
flaw with the film, though. It is a compliment, because "The Spanish 
Prisoner" is a thinking-person's film, and the complex story flows so 
effortlessly that it just goes to show how brilliant Mamet is as a 
writer.
The film begins as a man (Campbell Scott), on a business trip in the 
Cayman Islands with his colleagues, proposes "The Process," a highly 
secretive plan that will make his company very wealthy. While there, he 
meets a friendly businessman (Steve Martin), whom he begins to have 
doubts about after he returns to his home in New York City. But what is
 he hiding, if anything?
The delight in watching "The Spanish Prisoner," doesn't so much have to 
do with the intricate plot, but more about the sly, entertaining 
interactions that the characters have with each other, thanks to the 
exquisite dialogue, which is nothing short of flawless. I could listen 
to these people talking all day, and never get bored.
Because of the dialogue, most of the main stars are given particularly 
juicy roles. I can't recall Campbell Scott having this good of a role 
before, and it is a refreshing change of pace for Steve Martin, who is 
usually featured in comedies. Rebecca Pidgeon, as one of Scott's 
colleagues and a potential love interest, is a standout. She is given 
the most likable character, but also some of the best lines, and she has 
a natural charm about her. I definately look forward to seeing her in 
future films.
"The Spanish Prisoner," never particularly steps wrong, but, without 
giving its many secrets away, a negative development with one of the 
characters was a disappointment, and I truthfully felt kind of betrayed. 
But of course, it was followed with one of the films best lines that I 
wouldn't dream of spoiling. 
David Mamet doesn't direct that many films, but he is so distinguished 
as a screenwriter that if you are familiar with his work, you would 
certainly be able to recognize his signature dialogue. He is a class-act 
talent that is incomparable.

     What would it be like if celebrated playwright and screenwriter 
David Mamet collaborated with Franz Kafka?  While we'll never know for 
sure, THE SPANISH PRISONER gives a good indication.  This film, the 
fifth to be authored and directed by Mamet (whose recent script 
contributions include THE EDGE and WAG THE DOG), is both a sendup of the 
Hitchcock-type thriller and a legitimate entry into the genre.  It's 
Mamet's most convoluted plot since HOUSE OF GAMES, but, while the 
overall structure and style are of noir twistiness, the underlying 
message is something almost any viewer can relate to:  how corporate 
greed destroys trust and corrupts honest men.
     Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) has just invented "The Process", a 
revolutionary procedure that is going to give his company control of the 
market (to use Hitchcock terms, this is the movie's McGuffin).  But, 
while Joe thinks his work is worth a sizable bonus, the corporation's 
president, Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara), refuses to commit to a specific 
figure, assuring Joe only that his effort is appreciated.  While on a 
business trip to the Caribbean, Joe runs into Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), 
a mysterious, rich stranger who offers Joe a few tips about life and 
business.  Days later, in New York, Joe meets Jimmy again, and this 
begins his spiral into a strange world of deception, where nothing is 
what it first seems to be.  Soon, like so many heroes in films like 
this, he finds himself in an untenable position, wrongly accused with a 
pile of irrefutable evidence staring him in the face.  The only one he 
can trust is his secretary, Susan (Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who 
wants more than just a working relationship with him.
     Mamet's script supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of 
twists and turns, only a fraction of which are predictable. At times, 
the audience is a step ahead of the screenplay, but, most of the time, 
we're playing catch-up.  Although there are plenty of holes that Mamet 
has no interest is sewing up (trying to solve every riddle in THE 
SPANISH PRISONER is an exercise in futility), this is a smart film that 
develops a central character we can sympathize with  a modern version 
of Josef K. from Kafka's THE TRIAL.  The plot is delightfully 
preposterous, but holds together a lot better than the generic likes of 
PALMETTO and WILD THINGS.  The difference is simple:  those two films 
are for viewers who prefer to turn their brains off while THE SPANISH 
PRISONER is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the 
characters.  Mamet offers us the same clues he gives to Joe; we can 
piece the truth together along with him.  
     The most curious thing about THE SPANISH PRISONER is the ending 
(which I will not reveal in this review).  At first glance, it appears 
to be a common wrap-up that ties together several critical loose ends.  
There's a deus ex machina aspect to it which may indicate that Mamet is 
toying with the audience by sending up the manner in which this kind of 
movie must end to satisfy an audience.  But are things as 
straightforward as they seem?  Is this, in fact, the end, or is it just 
the latest twist in an incredibly complex con game?  
     The dialogue is, of course, pure Mamet.  The writer/director's 
characteristic style infuses every exchange with its peculiar, staccato 
rhythm.  There are those who find Mamet's approach to be off-putting, 
but, for movie-goers who allow its strange allure to captivate them 
(which usually takes a few minutes), it becomes apparent how crucial it 
is to the film's overall tone.  One other thing worth noting  Mamet 
scripts are typically known for being extremely profane (see GLENGARRY 
GLENN ROSS or AMERICAN BUFFALO for examples), but there isn't a single 
curse word in the whole of THE SPANISH PRISONER.  Mamet has achieved 
something extraordinary  a PG rating.
     One of the reasons the film is so strong is that nearly every major 
performance is impeccable.  Campbell Scott is entirely sympathetic as 
the befuddled, naďve victim.  Joe is, by his own admission, a boy scout 
whose chief trait is courtesy and who is ill-suited to emerge unscathed 
from the labyrinthine trap laid for him.  Rebecca Pidgeon is captivating 
as Joe's outspoken, would-be seductress.  Despite Susan's assertion that 
she has "a secretary mentality," it's clear that nothing could be 
further from the truth, and Joe's statement that he's "not looking for 
an office romance" doesn't dissuade her.  Steve Martin plays Jimmy Dell 
with the right mix of charm and menace.  He's clearly a dangerous figure 
 but for whom:  Joe or Joe's enemies?  Effective support is provided by 
Ben Gazzara and Ricky Jay (as Joe's lawyer friend).
     Although most viewers of THE SPANISH PRISONER will be personally 
unfamiliar with the kind of sinister plot that Joe stumbles into, the 
concepts of corporate greed and backstabbing will hit closer to home.  
The subtext of this film is the same as the one in many other Mamet 
offerings  how the current business climate rewards those who act 
ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics.  With a plot 
that would make Hitchcock proud, THE SPANISH PRISONER uses this 
outrageously elaborate, always-entertaining approach to illustrate these 
more serious concerns about what it takes to survive the '90s.

I suppose I never had a particularly strong belief in the integrity Corporate
America, but I don't know if I ever imagined the amount of backstabbing,
double-cross, and ultimately murderous greed that seems to permeate David
Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER. The film is centered around Joe Ross (Campbell
Scott), who has just come up with a new invention that looks to make a fortune
for his company. But as soon as he starts demanding his fair share, he finds
himself caught up in a conspiracy devised by someone who is evidently looking
to steal his idea and frame him for several crimes, thus putting him safely
out of the way.
Mamet builds up to this with a fairly long setup that is almost dreamlike in
its stiff, idiosyncratic dialogue and exposition. Many details are withheld,
such as what exactly Joe has invented, what his job is, what company he works
for, and exactly how much money they look to rake in (it's written on a
blackboard off-screen). A fair amount of the dialogue is concerned with issues
of finances or legal procedures, but the characters talk in a very detached
and precise manner regardless of the subject matter. When Susan Ricci (Rebecca
Pidgeon), a secretary from work, decides to pursue a romance with Joe, she
dispenses with most of the subtlety fairly quickly, stating what she wants
very clearly and directly, as if drawing up a business contract. And then
there's the occasional line that just comes out of nowhere, such as when
aristocrat Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin) offers to buy Joe's camera for a thousand
dollars with the same matter-of-fact, straightforward delivery one would
expect of someone asking to borrow a pencil.
Martin's performance is probably the strongest of any in the film. His offer
for the camera marks his first appearance, so we know there's something funny
about him from the very beginning. He doesn't let us forget it from then on,
developing an eerie presence that leads the viewer to question his motives,
but without coming right out and declaring, "Hey, I'm a bad guy!" Jimmy Dell
is hardly the only eerie element in this film, however: Joe and his employers
are so concerned about keeping his invention a secret from competitors that
they all start to seem a little bit paranoid after a while, especially when we
see the quasi-ominous poster hanging in the company hallways featuring a
pointing finger with the caption, "Somebody Talked!" Clearly, someone is going
to try to cheat Joe out of his fair share; we just don't know who or when.
Unfortunately, the stiffness that works so well for the first half of the film
starts to work against it once the double-cross is set in motion. In a series
of plot twists similar to (but somewhat more believable than) those found in
THE GAME, all traces of Joe's invention and past acquaintances suddenly start
disappearing, while at the same time he is framed for tax fraud and murder.
Mamet consistently keeps us guessing about the other characters' real motives
and about what will happen next, so I won't give away any more plot details.
The downside is that that's about all he does. Because of the precise but
emotionally distant way in which the characters behave, we never really
understand Joe as anything more than just a normal guy who's driven and
ambitious but still honest. Mamet seems to be pushing some sort of lesson
about greed and dishonesty, but it's difficult to appreciate it at any level
other than the strictly intellectual since Joe isn't quite three-dimensional
enough to act as a ciphen for Mamet's ideas to the audience.
The numerous deceptions do manage to tie together by the end without any
especially noticeable plot holes, and the script incorporates a number of what
seemed at first to be minor (but still noticeable) details into the overall
scheme. More than anything, THE SPANISH PRISONER really just runs into the
age-old problem of having created an intriguing mystery but then being obliged
to solve it by the time the credits roll. Still, it could have been somewhat
more successful had Mamet found a way to deliver the idiosyncratic and
enticing setup and make Joe a little more human at the same time. With the
stale characterizations, THE SPANISH PRISONER is not really much more than a
standard paranoid thriller, but it is certainly a very carefully crafted and
well-written one.

There is an unexpected joy I have in watching a David Mamet film - a joy
mostly derived from his expert unfolding of complex, involving puzzles.
Arguably, Mamet is always at his best when he directs his own screenplays as
evidenced by "House of Games" and "Oleanna" - his style is simple and direct.
"The Spanish Prisoner" is a terrifically entertaining film - an intriguing,
finely detailed, exhilarating comic puzzle that leads from one revelation to
another. 
Campbell Scott stars as Joe Ross, a bespectacled scientist-of-sorts who is also
a brilliant mathematician. He's also the inventor of the Process, an invention
that will make his company more lucrative than ever before. 
Ross's boss, Mr. Klein (a laid-back Ben Gazzara), is so impressed by the
Process that he holds a meeting in the Caribbean to discuss its future - a
company lawyer (Ricky Jay) is on hand to look after the finances. On the
Caribbean, Joe meets a typical Mamet character named Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin)
who offers Joe one-thousand dollars for his watch - this is the kind of request
that should drive Joe away from Jim not towards him. Denying his request, Joe
decides to accept Jim's dinner invitation in exchange for his apologetic
remarks.
Naturally, Jimmy Dell is the driving anchor of the movie and it would be unfair
for me to explain what the plot's surprises have in store for you. Suffice to
say, if you are a Mamet fan you'll anticipate many of the twists and turns the
plot takes. If you have seen the Mamet-like labyrinth "The Game," you'll see
some distinct similarities.
Surprisingly, "The Spanish Prisoner" works because of its characters and the
sharp dialogue rather than the elaborate machinations of the plot. Joe Ross is
the bland every man whom things happen to and not always for any clear reasons.
As played by Campbell Scott, the character is broadly sketched displaying no
apparent flaws or weaknesses except that he's too trustworthy. In other words,
he's a cipher - a trait uncharacteristic of Mamet - but Scott manages to bring
some droll, subtle humor to Joe's character. 
Two of the finest performances in the film are by Steve Martin and Rebecca
Pidgeon (Mamet's wife). Steve Martin gives a superb, restrained performance as
the seemingly rich New Yorker who asks for other simple services of Joe such as
sending a book to his sister in New York. Is that all Jim wants, or is he up to
no good? Martin's poise and mannered speaking are as fluent and as engaging as
anything he's done in his career. 
Rebecca Pidgeon (an accomplished singer in real-life who also starred in
Mamet's "Homicide") plays one of the sweetest, smartest women in all of Mamet's
works. Her character, Susan, Joe's secretary, bears a certain affection to Joe
that leads to all kinds of plot turns. Susan is sexy, intelligent, convivial, a
bit annoying in the beginning but we grow to like and accept her, and is
manipulative and perhaps deceitful, but we are never sure. My two favorite
scenes with Pidgeon are the airplane scene, where she discusses how you never
truly know the people in your life, and a hilarious moment where she fabricates
an argument with Joe to evade questions from the police. 
"The Spanish Prisoner" is in many ways both akin and atypical of Mamet's former
films. For one, the film is rated PG. Gone are the customary four-letter words
we normally associate with Mamet and, as a result, it's also more light on its
feet and less heavy than usual. Part of its lightness comes from the greenish,
mossy look of the cinematography that fits perfectly with the title and the
mood. Although the film is occasionally flawed and unevenly paced, "The Spanish
Prisoner" is still high quality verbal entertainment. From Mamet, I wouldn't
have expected less.

I am resubmitting this review, which I originally submitted last month.
David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER is yet another story where an
innocent man is beset by demons but defended by angels and ministers of
grace.  Movies like this usually depend on a passive central character
and are thus emotionally uninvolving no matter how intellectually
engaging they may be.  This one's no different, although it's told
reasonably well.
Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) works for a company and has discovered a
process.  Mamet intentionally leaves the nature of the business and
Joe's discovery vague; what's important is that the new invention will
make them lots of money.  He's sent to a Caribbean island where he meets
Julian "Jimmy" Dell (Steve Martin), a wealthy playboy with a propensity
for eccentric gestures like setting Joe up with a Swiss bank account - 
it only has 15 francs in it, but the Swiss will keep the balance a
secret, and Joe can impress people with his account.  But there's a
point to Jimmy's apparent whims, and Joe soon finds himself bilked out
of his discovery, with the police thinking that he has stolen it from
the company.  The only person he can trust is his secretary, Susan Ricci
(Rebecca Pidgeon), who believes he's innocent.
It's a nice little shell game that Mamet puts us through, though there
are a few holes.  When Joe discovers a friend murdered, he flees the
scene rather than face the cops who are hot on his heels.  By doing so,
he seems to play right into the hands of both the bad guys and the good
guys.  But why would they count on him running, especially when everyone
keeps testifying to what a straight arrow he is?  Why don't they figure
on him leading the cops to the dead body?  Such questions make Joe a
cipher, and Campbell Scott, accomplished actor that he is, can't get to
the bottom of the character.
There are other problems, too.  Mamet has been directing movies for 11
years, and he still hasn't even reached adequacy.  The overall pacing is
fine, but the movie looks drab, and he blows the big climactic moment by
drawing it out in slow-motion.  Mamet's dialogue, his great strength as
a writer, is off as well.  OLEANNA had too many broken sentences and
dramatic pauses in inappropriate places.  THE SPANISH PRISONER has too
many pronouncements on matters philosophical - Joe's friend George
(Ricky Jay) says, "Worry is like interest paid in advance on a debt that
never comes due."  When Susan responds to the simple query of "How are
you?" with, "The wolves are howling at my troika," you just wince at the 
artifice.
And then there's Rebecca Pidgeon, who is Mrs. Mamet in real life.  She's
been a constant in his stage plays, but (besides a small part in
HOMICIDE) Mamet has had the decency to keep her out of his movies until
now.  She's a flat, irritatingly fraudulent presence whose jocular good
cheer is transparently phony.  The rest of the cast, though, ranges from
good enough to excellent - worth singling out are Felicity Huffman as an
FBI agent and Ed O'Neill as her cool, brisk supervisor.  Best of all is
Steve Martin, who slips into Mamet's world with frightening ease, as he
keeps finding layers to this man with ulterior motives.  With much less
fanfare than Robin Williams or Tom Hanks or (most recently) Jim Carrey,
Steve Martin has made himself into a dramatic actor of considerable
weight.  Actually, he had that kind of heft before any of them - check
out his performance in the great PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (1981).  He has 
devoted more and more time to writing essays and plays and become very
good at them, but let's hope he gives us a few more performances like
this.

Basically, "Last Days of Disco" sold out minutes before I got to the
movie theater.  The people right in front of me were the first ones
turned away, one of those if-I-hadn't-sat-on-my-ass-those-five-minutes
moments.  But I did want to see "The Spanish Prisoner", having liked
"House of Games" a lot when I saw it a few years ago.
"The Spanish Prisoner" is the story of a man caught in an elaborate
con, to separate him from the industrial secrets he holds.  He's the
inventor of "the Process", which will apparently allow his company to
corner the market, or something like that.  Perhaps he works for
Gilette, and what they're talking about is the new Mach 3 razor, with
three (!) blades instead of two.  Perhaps not.  It's immaterial: the
book he has, with the Process scribbled down as a jumble of nonsense
mathematics (clearly taking place in the age before computers) is the
object of this game.
David Mamet is supposed to be a master of dialog.  I thought the dialog
was remarkably annoying in this film.  He feels compelled to make his
actors repeat things, over and over again.  In "House of Games", this
trick conveys a sense of menace, of deliberate probing.  It works.  In
"Spanish Prisoner", it reminded me of a scene from "The Simpsons", in
which Bart (or Homer) approaches a moment of epiphany.  Random words
and noises sound like the thing he's trying to think of (though,
probably, if it was Homer, he got it wrong).  "Spanish Prisoner" was
like this, with the repetitions pointing to something obvious, which
the audience should have seen many, many minutes before the folks on
screen.
The ending also feels patched together.  There was another con
working.  When it started is unclear: there were no moments when,
thinking back on the film, you could have said, ah ha!  It comes out of
thin air, a deus ex machina, thorougly unexplained and unjustified.
The cons fall into two classes, then: those that are telegraphed well
in advanced, and those that come out of the blue.  Neither is
particularly satisfying.
The comparison with "House of Games" is inevitable.  There are a series
of cons throughout "House", but they all have these retrospective ah-ha
moments.  They make sense.  Cons are also seen to fail because of
contingency: someone in the wrong spot at the wrong time, etc.  The con
men are not omniscient, not omnipotent.  We seem them improvise when
things go wrong.  And they sometimes fail because of accidents.
As a bonus in "House of Games", we see some secondary cons: ways to
lift money out of an envelope, tricks you can play in a Western Union
office, the idea of a tell.  In that film, you have a feeling that
you're being let into the con man's world, a gritty place of
smoke-shrouded poker games and greasy spoon diners.  This impression
that you're seeing things you're not supposed to see is missing from
"Spanish Prisoner".  "Prisoner" plays out as a caper film of high money
and elaborate contrivances.  It's nothing in particular.
One minor plus with "Prisoner", though, is that it was apparently
filmed in my neighborhood.  They use the 79th Street IRT, and shoot a
few scenes outside the Althrop, this hulking building at 79th and
Broadway (It's apparently hollow on the inside, with a court yard.
Rich people live there.)
"The court determined that Fox TV does not impede free and fair
competition in the teen-angst soap-com genre, therefore Party of Five
need not be broken into five 'Parties of One,' one being distributed to
each of the other networks."

David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner is about a bunch of people who are
so smart and witty that it seems they are infallible in both speech and
action.  The film appears to take place in an alternate reality, in
which the people described above are strictly governed by laws that keep
them from going outside of Mamet's jigsaw plotting.  It's not what I'd
call a realistic film (the circumstances behind the events that unfold
are about as unlikely as, say, the secrets revealed in Fincher's The
Game), though I suppose it's not any less-realistic than any film of
this genre.  But Mamet's plot is so twisted, convoluted, and complex
that just about the only thing I could do during and after was
scrutinize it.
I don't mind too much.  You see, I respect any film that brandishes
intelligence as if it knows it's the only smart film out there.  Mamet
has created a situation that, I believe, could not happen outside a
movie set, but the story is so ingenious and compelling that I can't
help but admire it.  The film is also entertaining, which helps a lot,
and the acting is unique in that the actors clearly understand that they
are playing people who can not and never will exist in the real world.  
The main character is Joe Ross, played valiantly by the ever-solid
Campbell Scott.  The film begins with Joe on vacation in the Caribbean;
he's there for a business meeting, along with his friend and co-worker,
George Lang (Ricky Jay), and boss, Klein (Ben Gazzara).  He also meets
Susan Ricci (Rebecca Pidgeon), who turns out to be an underling in his
company; and Jimmy Dell (Steven Martin), who seems to be just a rich guy
spending time in the Caribbean.
I've given you the setup, but I don't know how to summarize the rest of
the plot without giving away things that you shouldn't know.  I went
into the film with no prior knowledge of it, except from what I got out
of the preview (which is very little -- some marketing execs should take
a look at the the trailer for this film and examine how it works), and I
found that the film was far different from what I expected.  The twists
are big an unpredictable, and placed in parts when you probably won't
expect a twist to occur.
A film like this basically comes down to a couple things -- acting and
plot.  As I said, Mamet's story is compelling and ingeniously
conceived.  Writers for big-budget Hollywood mysteries should take
lessons from this film, for this is the way to create a complex story
that seems at first glance to be so much more simple than it is, and
then fully explain every turn and make it as believable as possible. 
(The problem with writing a review of a film like this is that I have to
be vague and ambiguous while explaining these qualities, but I'm sure
you understand.)
The acting is interesting, so much that I often just wanted to see what
strange things the characters might do.  This is the kind of film where
every character speaks in riddles, enunciates each word perfectly, and
then predicts what the other characters are going to say.  The most
fascinating character is Susan, played by Pidgeon (an actress with whom
I'm not familiar).  She's an enticing woman, and has striking facial
features.  Her dialogue is the sharpest in the film, and her demeanor is
unlike most female characters in most films.  Also very interesting is
Steve Martin (who, I should point out, does not go for one single joke
throughout the film); he plays his character much like Pidgeon plays
hers -- straight-faced and alarmingly calm.
The Spanish Prisoner is not really a film to be taken seriously.  I
doubt that Mamet had any deeper intentions than what are obvious here;
it seems clear that he simply wanted to dazzle audiences with a plot so
complex and (ahem) contrived that they walk out of the theaters smiling
with disbelief.  As I said, not even for a glimpse of a second is this a
realistic picture.  But it succeeds so entirely in being an
unpredictable and compelling puzzle of a film that I can't imagine not
liking it just for this reason.

   The Bible says, "Respect, but suspect."  Ronald Reagan's
favorite quote (about a new relationship with the Soviets), was
"Trust, but verify."  Any gambler will tell you, "Have faith, but
cut the cards."  It's a tough world out there, as David Mamet
well knows, where you just don't know who people really are. 
The lesson we take home from "The Spanish Prisoner" is,
"Don't be naive, don't be a victim.  Harden your shell or you'll
be taken for a ride."  But "The Spanish Prisoner," despite this
moral and its PG rating, is not didactic, it's not a junior high-
school lesson, and in fact it's for a special, mature, adult
audience that can appreciate his signature dialogue, craft at
developing a plot, and ability to capture and challenge his
viewers.  With due respect to "House of Games," which
featured his wife (from 1977 to 1989), Lindsay Crouse, in an
absorbing tale of cheating card sharps, "The Spanish
Prisoner" is perhaps his most intricate and arresting film to
date.  A Hitchcockian fable, it will keep you guessing to the
very last frame.
   Mention con arts and you're likely to think of small-timers
like the 3-card monte players who, working with shills, take
suckers for $20 a shot on urban street corners.  Or you may
recall cases of ATM scams usually involving elderly women
who freely withdraw money from their accounts in the hope of
gaining larger sums from the tricksters.  "The Spanish
Prisoner" deals at base with situations that are not very
different, but they involve much larger sums of money and the
gamesmanship involves surprise antics such as the setting up
of Swiss bank accounts, romantic interludes at a posh
Caribbean resort, a hushed dinner conversation at a chic
private clubs, and conversations between executives in a
modish Manhattan office.  The name of the game is money,
and the villains are more likely wear Armani suits than Adidas
sneakers and baseball caps.
   Featuring a superb performance by Campbell Scott (son of
George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst who looks nothing like
his folks), "The Spanish Prisoner" deals with a plot to steal
the blueprint of an invention, one which is called a process
and consisting of a notebook filled with mathematical symbols
that only Will Hunting and a few people of an inner circle
could decipher.  Only one copy exists, and that is kept under
lock by its inventor, Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) in a safe in his
company office.  The confidence people are determined to pry
that book from his hands and play on Joe's resentment at
being put off each time he asks for the bonus he knows he
deserves.  When businessman Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin)
hears of the Joe's plight during a conversation they have in
the fictional Caribbean island of St. Estephe, he offers to help
and invites the inventor to a dinner when they return to New
York.  In an intrigue involving a company secretary, Susan
(Rebecca Pidgeon--who is the wife of writer-director Mamet)
and a company lawyer, George Lang (Ricky Jay), Joe finds
himself getting deeply involved in an machination which takes
him far afield from his original motive to receive his due from
his reluctant boss, Klein (Ben Gazzara).  Though he receives
the assistance of an FBI agent, Pat McCune (Felicity
Huffman)--who sets up a sting to capture the alleged criminal
Dell--Joe becomes the perfect patsy, a Kafkaeseque victim
who is arrested and who faces a long jail term for acts he
would not dream of committing.
   David Mamet's critics have long held that his movie
characters are nothing but cold, skilled mechanics; that his
films are simply games that are not playful and hardly
absorbing.  While the anti-Mamet contingent may well
consider "The Spanish Prisoner" another in a line of films like
"House of Games" with the idiomatic dialogue found most
conspicuously in "Speed-the-Plow," his fans--and indeed a
crossover audience as well--will not only love his latest effort
but be tempted to see it once more to catch clues they may
have missed.
   The noir ambiance of "The Spanish Prisoner" is furthered
by Carter Burwell's eerie soundtrack in a movie that seems
always to hold back the very information which could give
away the store.  Crackling dialogue, a wonderful cast which
includes Steve Martin, who is apparently seeking to broaden
his base with serious roles, and a riveting performance by
Campbell Scott as a vulnerable everyman, should be included
on every serious moviegoer's schedule.  Rated PG.  Running
Time: 112 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten

The ancient wisdom reads, "If you're in a poker game, and you can't tell
who the pigeon is, it's you."  David Mamet's newest is not about a con
game rather than a poker game, but the ancient wisdom applies.  The
pigeon is Joe Ross (Campbell Scott), a mathematician at "The Company"
and inventor of "The Process".  "The Process" is a valuable calculus
formula (or something like that) that stands to earn Ross and "The
Company" millions, if he can hold on to it.
If you haven't seen a David Mamet movie, shame on you.  Go rent House of
Games right now.  Those of us who have know what to expect:  crisp
dialogue and Byzantine plotting.  The Spanish Prisoner doesn't
disappoint in these areas.  The rapid-fire, intelligent Mamet trademark
dialogue is on display here in all its glory.  The confidence game (when
we finally see it unfold) is slick and cunning, with a touch of purest
evil.  (I refuse to spoil the movie for you by giving away any details.)
And yet, for all the richness of its script and strength of its plot,
The Spanish Prisoner is a poor, weak shadow of previous Mamet efforts.
And it's a weak movie because it focuses on the Campbell Scott
character.  Part of it is that Mamet really isn't interested in Scott's
character or what he does.  Part of it is that Scott really isn't very
interesting as an actor -- he plays the entire movie like he's trying to
do a Harold Ramis imitation.  Scott gets called a Boy Scout a lot in
this movie (he even has a Scout knife that says "Be Prepared") and he is
brave, reverent and clean and all that, but God love him, he isn't
interesting.  And it's not fair to say that he's not interesting because
he's the pigeon -- the pigeons nesting outside my office are more
interesting than Scott is in this movie.
You would think that the supporting characters would help pull this
movie off, and you would be wrong.  Mamet favorite Ricky Jay makes an
appearance, but is sadly underused and does little more than spout
platitudes.  Steve Martin (unseen since Sgt. Bilko, can that be right?)
is a Dirty Rotten Scoundrel, sure enough, but he's done the con-man
schtick much better in the two aforementioned movies and in Leap of
Faith.  Ben Gazarra is in the movie but shouldn't be.
The saving grace of The Spanish Prisoner is Rebecca Pidgeon as Susan
Ricci, Scott's loyal secretary.  Mamet has put some odd, anachronistic
dialogue into her mouth ("Crikey!"  "Dog my cats.") but she is
impressive and convincing in a pivotal role.  She has a very odd
delivery which would be very annoying if she weren't spouting
tailor-made Mamet dialogue.  This is her first big movie role, and I
hope to see her again.
The movie's mantra is "The Process".  "The Process" is valuable,
precious, and will lead to controlling the market in some vague and
nebulous way.  And there's a process at work in The Spanish Prisoner,
too, and it is crafted by a masterful filmmaker.  But any process is
only as good as the people who implement it -- and in The Spanish
Prisoner, the implementation sabotages The Process.

        Independent films thrive on their dialogue, storytelling, characterization
and other basic aspects while the big-budget Hollywood blockbusters use these
elements only as needed. "The Spanish Prisoner" seems to be an independent
film that tries to have it both ways, as it's a standard thriller that
attempts to substitute emotion and sympathy for special effects and production
design. 
        The basic set-up to the story is rather simple, but explaining the
significant aspects is a complicated task as many details are pushed aside to
make room for the plot. We start out somewhere in the Caribbean where we meet
our four main characters: Joe Ross (Scott), a young man who is apparently
successful, as he has just finished some kind of mathematical or chemical
formula that will change the world; Susan Ricci (Pidgeon), Joe's new personal
secretary who adores him like a 5-year-old with a large vocabulary; George
Lang (Jay), Joe's co-worker and company lawyer who plays a role in how
successful he will become; and Jimmy Dell (Martin), a wealthy-but-mysterious
businessman who serves as the film's main catalyst (and only interesting
character).
        Right from the beginning it's clear the film is establishing all the key
elements which will crop up later. The pacing is slow, tedious, and often
boring and it's not due to overwhelming detail, but to lack thereof. Almost
nothing happens in terms of plot, only scene after scene of the generic
highbrow, 5th Avenue business rhetoric. When the Jimmy Dell character is
introduced, it's through a manner which is impossible to understand at the
time, and only minor details crop up later to explain the significance to the
rest of the plot.
        Mamet has often been called a master of characterization and dialogue, yet
the entire first act seems more like a novel acted out rather than a modern
film. The performances are mediocre and conflicting because the actors are
playing caricatures, not characters (i.e. Scott as the monotone loner and
Pidgeon as the happy-go-lucky extrovert). Most importantly, we don't learn
much about Joe, nor about "The Process" he has invented and its application.
The absence of that is probably one of the film's central themes, but since it
creates for a snowball effect of flaws, it's more distracting than anything
else.
        Although the first half tends to wander with little focus, everything comes
back into play as the second half turns almost instantly into a suspenseful
thriller. What had been a subtle, almost irrelevant sub-plot involving a
conflict and cooperation between Joe and Jimmy suddenly becomes the main focal
point of the film. Jimmy had always been an enigmatic character, and when Joe
realizes he has just been completely taken advantage of and framed into a
situation impossible of escape, a fantastic case of the perfect conspiracy is
evident.
        Throughout the second and third act the plot thickens as Joe becomes
entrapped by just about everyone and everything and it's impossible to tell
who's who and what's what. The "Batman Syndrome" (where by a seemingly normal
man is transformed into a brilliant detective and stunt man) takes over, and
it doesn't work because the atmosphere isn't gripping enough to believe. The
story is so involved with itself that everything that happens seems to take
place within a reality shared by only a few characters while no one else in
the world seems to notice the insanity going on (unless it creates for
suspense) [example of the former: Joe and Susan running from police and
villains through airports and boat docks while no one seems to notice the
chaos; example of the latter: everyone in the world noticing some blood on
Joe's hands as he rides the subway, giving the impression he is about to be
"caught"].
        Even if "The Spanish Prisoner" fails to be a thrilling adventure, it still
has an original hook, that is, an independent take on a tired Hollywood
formula. It's a valiant effort to be sure, but the net result is a bit too
sensational and thus the impact isn't as strong as it could be.

     I recall being only mildly impressed with David Mamet's HOUSE OF
GAMES when I first saw it a decade ago, despite general critical acclaim.
Sure, it was a meticulously crafted intellectual puzzle, and, even more
impressive, it was a puzzle which didn't fall apart completely as you were
thinking about it on the way home.  With Lindsey Crouse serving serving as
its remote heroine, however, all its unpredictable twists felt like they
were taking place in a vacuum, leaving little reason to care about anyone
in the story.  Crafty, yes, but soulless.
     Five years of wading through cinema at its most mind-numbing has
given me a new appreciation for meticulously crafted intellectual puzzles,
even if they are of the soulless variety.  Mamet's new psychological
mystery THE SPANISH PRISONER, a thoroughly intriguing cinematic engine, 
definitely falls into that category.  Campbell Scott stars as a young
corporate underling named Joe who has created a potential cash cow called
The Process for his company.  Unfortunately for Joe, little of that milk
looks likely to end up in his cup.  Enter Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a
smooth operator who promises Joe a windfall if he'll turn over The
Process.
     It's best to cut off any plot summary at this point, lest certain
turns of narrative be inadvertently revealed.  Suffice it to say that THE
SPANISH PRISONER tackles familiar Mamet subjects like breakdowns in trust
and deceptive appearances, accompanied by the familiar-bordering-on-cliche
staccato rhythms of Mamet's dialogue.  It also features crisp pacing
courtesy of editor Barbara Tulliver, and yet another insinuating score
from the gifted Carter Burwell.  Most significantly, it features a story
which manipulates in all the best senses of the word.  In an era where
most films leave you suspecting the re-writes had been commissioned from a
room full of chimps, THE SPANISH PRISONER treats an audience with respect
-- no cheap tricks, no flip-a-coin-to-pick-the-killer endings, just a
smart and surprising entertainment.
     There's a lot to admire about the construction of THE SPANISH
PRISONER, but it shouldn't be so difficult to find a sympathetic human
protagonist to guide a story like this.  Campbell Scott is a versatile,
capable performer with the requisite look of naivete to play Hitchcockian
dupe; he also reads virtually every line of Mamet's script with a
deadening flatness.  That goes ditto and double for Rebecca Pidgeon, whose
turn as Joe's affectionate confidante falls apart with every forced line.
While Steve Martin does marvelously cagey work as the mysterious Jimmy --
he's one of the few cast members who seems to have a grip on Mamet's style
-- Scott feels as though he's being pulled grudgingly through the story
because _somebody's_ got to be the hero.
     Even with its lack of a vibrant hero, I can't be too hard on  THE
SPANISH PRISONER.  In fact, that absence only really started to bother me
on the way home, which is usually where the plots of such films start to
bother me.  I do wish that Mamet, who clearly has mastered the art of
plotting, could make his films as emotionally compelling as they are
intellectually satisfying.  Giving his houses of games hearts to match
their brains would make him one of our finest film-makers.

People are gushing over this movie and it all seems so undeserved. Without
giving too much away, the movie's theme and subsequent plot equals its
tagline "Can you really trust anyone?" Apparently not. You cannot even
trust David Mamet. 
My biggest problems with The Spanish Prisoner were two: The film is very
stagy and unexciting in its presentation. It's unswervingly flat. While
it's nice not to be manipulated by music and editing now and then, this
Spartan approach is a bit uninvolving as it continues past 30 minutes
through the conclusion of the film. There is unforgivably complete lack of
filmwork, like editing and camera movement. While it adds to the cinema
verite unemotional presentation of a con game, it prompts less and less
audience investment as it moves towards its inevitable conclusion. 
The other problem is that this film is a lot like another Mamet film:
*House of Games*. Its a bit much to see a director steal from his own
repertoire. You expect that from Brian DiPalma (I am one of eight people
who saw *Raising Cain*, so I should know). The idea that you never really
know someone and it's difficult to trust others is hit home here, as in
the older movie, and we are hit over the head with this repeatedly. That
people are taken in easily is nothing new; that it can be this perfectly
orchestrated stretches common sense, though.
In its favor, there are some wonderfully quirky moments and some genuine
laughs. Most of these come from the office ingenue, Susan Ricci (the
ironically named Rebecca Pidgeon). The movie begins with the arrival of
Joe Ross (the lead role played by Campbell Scott) to a ritzy Carribean
isle--St. Estaphe. It's a business retreat also attended by the paranoid
boss Klein (Ben Gazzara) and George Lang (Ricky Jay), Joe's co-worker and
friend, who is constantly spouting off aphorisms, some humorous and some
ridiculous.
While on the island, Joe falls into a odd, close friendship with the
mysterious Jimmy Dell. The action moves to New York, where after some odd
run-ins with Dell, Joe starts to realize that something is afoot, and the
secret patent-pending formula is is working on is in danger. There is a
very odd feeling of homoerotica (I don't think it's just my pink glasses
getting in the way here) between Joe and Jimmy; that Jimmy is conning him
and Joe is falling for it and that there is some attraction for Jimmy from
Joe are not coincidental. The only other chemistry Joe has is with THE
IDEA that Jimmy wants his sister to date Joe, a man Jimmy approves for
her.
I cannot say much more without ruining the movie. I will say this, though;
it's not worth full price. See it with coupons or sneak in (like someone I
know did), or wait for TV or video. I would normally never recommend this,
but it's so utterly uncinematic and flat that rushing to the cinema to see
it seems unnecessary. 
With a good director and a good cast, you would think this movie would be
a lot better. I expect so much more from David Mamet, who usually produces
excellent work, like he did in last year's The Edge.
