Diane Weston (Marley Shelton) is the famed head chearleader of the "A" squad 
at Lincoln High School. Her best friends and co-cheerleaders are the 
tough-as-nails Kansas (Mena Suvari), the religious-nut Hannah (Rachel 
Blanchard), the Conan O'Brien-obsessed Cleo (Melissa Georgia), and the 
book-smart Lucy (Sara Marsh). From the second Diane literally knocks sweet 
football jock Jack Bartlett (James Marsden) down while doing backflips at a 
school pep rally, they falls instantly in love. Before long, Diane is 
pregnant, and realizing their love for each other, she and Jack decide to get 
married. With her at home with a bun in the oven, and Jack working 
minimum-wage at a video store, Diane forms a plan for her and the girls to 
learn from the mistakes of movie character thieves, so that they can 
successfully rob a bank and get the amount of cash each of them needs for the 
future.
This is the setup of "Sugar & Spice," a highly satirical jab at cheerleaders, 
bank robberies, and teenage pregnancy from director Francine McDougall and 
screenwriter Mandy Nelson. What begins as an inanely unfunny "stupid teen 
movie" eventually finds its footing at the 20-minute mark to become a 
surprisingly clever and knowing comedy that curiously pays tribute to many 
popular gangster/thief movies, including "Reservoir Dogs," "Heat," "Dog Day 
Afternoon," and "Point Break." The writing miraculously becomes fresh and 
appropriately zany, and the film runs at a fast pace, never growing outwardly 
tedious for a minute (save for the whole terrible opening section).
Moving at the trajectory it was remaining successfully on, "Sugar & Spice" 
might have been an early moviegoing surprise for 2001. Unfortunately, just as 
the film has gained maximum momentum, it ends abruptly in midstream, never 
wrapping up its characters or the story in any satisfying manner. At just 80 
minutes (including end credits), the picture feels rushed and rather 
pointless--a nice enough diversion, but one that fails to go that extra mile 
to become anything other than such.
The characters, in staying with the satire of the piece, which often reminds 
one of 1999's far superior "Election" and "Drop Dead Gorgeous," fit neatly 
into the package and are entertaining individuals, except for one problem: 
they are never developed outside of one or two personal traits. Because of 
this, their potentially bright, inspired performances are more or less 
wasted. Marley Shelton (1999's "The Bachelor") appears in almost every scene 
as the put-upon protagonist, Diane, but she remains at arm's length with the 
viewer, never being allowed to break out from a broad caricature. The same 
goes for the rest of the girls, with rising star Mena Suvari (1999's 
"American Beauty") sorely wasted as the edgy Kansas. Marla Sokoloff (2000's 
"Whatever It Takes") does offer up some fun, however, as the spiteful Lisa, a 
member of the "B" squad cheerleading team who dispises the "A" squad and, 
coincidentally, witnesses the bank robbery and recognizes the girls (despite 
being equipped with Betty doll masks). Meanwhile, James Marsden (2000's 
"X-Men") has nothing to do but look and act like a lovable, if immature, 
doofus.
For the majority of its too-brief running time, "Sugar & Spice" runs so close 
to the line of delightfully savage lampooning that it is all the more 
disappointing when the movie never follows through with its ambitious nature. 
Writer Mandy Nelson surely knows how to write smart-allecky, at time even 
ingenious, dialogue, but she has failed in exposing any sort of emotional 
truths about its characters or the situations. Since that is the key to a 
good satire--playfully mocking people and valid societal issues while 
offering up a bit of ironic realism--"Sugar & Spice" ultimately misses the 
boat by a millimeter.

Cheerleaders become bank robbers...that had to be the sales
pitch for this off-beat, teen crime-caper comedy that inexplicably
tickles the funny bone. To begin with, there are these five
cheerleaders at Lincoln High School. They're best friends, bosom
buddies, golden girls. So when their perky, relentlessly optimistic
A-squad captain (Marley Shelton) gets pregnant by the simpleminded
star quarterback (James Marsden) and discovers the Beatles were wrong
- "Love isn't all you need!" - they decide to rob a bank. After all,
that's where the money is, right? At least according to Keanu Reeves
in "Point Break," the vintage surf 'n' heist film, with specifics
supplied by the rebellious daughter (Mena Suvari) of a convict (Sean
Young). While the wholesome, devout Christian (Rachel Blanchard) and
fantasy-ridden Conan O'Brien fan (Melissa George) take a bit of
convincing, the Harvard-bound brainchild (Sara Marsh) opts out. But
the human pyramid doesn't collapse, since she's quickly replaced by a
munitions dealer's daughter (Alexandra Holden). There's a slight hitch
when a jealous member of the B-squad (Marla Sokoloff) squeals to the
police but she's quickly appeased. Sure, it's shallow. It's supposed
to be. What do you expect from a fizzy, pop culture send-up, complete
with red-white-and-blue pom-poms and Madonna lyrics recited as
inspirational poetry? Director Francine McDougall, writer Mandy Nelson
and cinematographer Robert Brinkmann share the same vision: taking
"girl power" to outrageous extremes. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "Sugar & Spice" is a sassy, irreverent, saucy 6. Despite
memories of the tragedy of the Columbine shootings in 1999, this
satirical dark comedy about girls and guns offers more giggles than
one might expect. "Cheerleaders kick...!"

PLOT:
A cute and cuddly cheerleading squad consider robbing a bank, when their
captain gets preggers and must deal with the harsh reality of paying bills,
etc... The girls watch movies and talk to some real-life con-women to get
prepared for their roles.
CRITIQUE:
Despite my rating of "so-so", I was actually disappointed with this movie
because its fresh and punchy premise started off strong, only to disappear
in the film's less than impressive second half. What the heck happened
there? Here's a movie that bangs out on all cylinders, give you a few
smiles, a few laughs, some dark comedy and a very cool idea, and suddenly
about halfway through, the screenwriter seems to have given up on the whole
thing and just wrapped it all up with some filler. I'd love to know what
happened. If anyone associated with this production can explain this to me,
please email me...seriously! My theory is that the "premise" of the movie
alone sold it to the production company. "Five wholesome cheerleading
teenage girls out to rob banks"-- where do we sign? But once production
started, they probably realized that they actually had to make a complete
story out of this very cool premise and despite the second half playing
"okay", most people will likely be let down. Seemed kinda anticlimactic to
me. But all is not lost, since the film does still ring original, which is
why I would still recommend it to most.
Just take some HEATHERS, grab a stick o' RESERVOIR DOGS and dash it all up
with some BRING IT ON (natch, the film grossed all kinds of dough last year)
and that's pretty much what you've got here, albeit...on a very light tip.
The girls are all very good in their roles, over-the-top, goofy and pretty
sexy for the most part. Teenage boys can't really go wrong with this movie,
as the girls love to walk around in their cutesy-patootsy cheerleading
outfits no matter where they go, and we even get a couple of Victoria's
Secret moments. Woo-hoo! And teenage girls will likely connect to the whole
concept of wanting to rob banks in Betty masks...uuuhmmm, well, you get the
idea. Female empowerment, rah-rah and all that jazz! And howsabout that
James Marsden? Yowsa! And kudos to the makers of this film for tipping the
proper cap of homage out to their influences such as POINT BREAK, HEAT and
many more. So what can you take away from this review? Well, I liked the
whole "idea" of the movie, enjoyed most of its execution, till about the
half-way point, and was pretty disappointed in the film's second half (which
slowed and seemed to forget about one character in particular...what the
hell?) and its very weak ending. I don't know what to tell you, kids. I'm
pretty much in the middle on this one. Great marketing, cool premise, creepy
masks, but in the end, too much unrealized potential. Check out my ratings
of similar films below and see if you jive with me at all.
PS: And by the way, Heather Graham does not star in this movie! I know, I
know...the lead girl looks EXACTLY like her, but trust me when I tell you
that it's not her. It took The Arrow and I some time to figure this out, but
geez, do they ever look alike or what? The actress' name in question in
Marley Shelton.
Where's JoBlo coming from?
Charlie's Angels (8/10) - Election (7/10) - Heathers (8/10) - Heat (8/10) -
Point Break (7/10) - Reservoir Dogs (9/10)

It almost sounded too good to be true - high school cheerleaders-turned-bank
robbers, and slumber parties where they roll around together in giant piles
of cash wearing only underwear and bras.  But Sugar & Spice's PG-13 rating
dashed the hopes and dreams of men throughout the country.  The good news is
that the film probably deserved an R rating, and while the slumber party
money-rolling scene was left out, there is a slumber party money-throwing
scene.  It's not the same, but at least it's something.
Spice is about the A-squad cheerleading team at Lincoln High School who
decide to rob a bank to ensure the financial security of the unborn child of
the team's captain who was knocked up by the school's dreamily dumb
quarterback.  A silly concept, but rife with comedic possibilities, the film
stretches a weak script that would have been better suited for a short into
a (barely) feature length picture that, like the last big cheerleading flick
(Bring It On) tries way to hard to have witty, acidic dialogue like
Clueless.
Spice, which is shown almost entirely in flashback, opens with jealous
B-squad cheerleader Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff, The Practice) spilling her
guts in a police interrogation.  Lisa had nothing to do with the bank
robbery, or the events leading up to it, but happily fingers the girls who
were involved.  At first, her voiceover and the flashback technique work
well to establish the background of each of the film's characters, but it
quickly becomes very tiresome.  An alarming percentage of Spice is told with
the voiceover, which usually signals a major problem and attempted last
minute resuscitation in the editing room.
The five members of Lincoln A-team are the typical cross section of girls
you'd find in any teen movie.  Kansas (Mena Suvari, Loser) is the bad ass,
Hannah (Rachel Blanchard, Road Trip) is the goody-goody Bible-thumper, Lucy
(Sara Marsh) is the Harvard-bound braniac, Cleo (Melissa George, The Limey)
is obsessed with Conan O'Brien, and Diane (Marley Shelton, Never Been
Kissed) is the perpetually perky captain who becomes impregnated by Tom
Cruise-clone named Jack (James Marsden, X-Men).  That's right - Jack and
Diane.
When Diane realizes that she and Jack don't have enough money to take care
of their impending arrival, she hatches the idea to knock off the grocery
store bank branch she works at after school.  Diane gets the idea from
watching Point Break, and she and her cheering chums pick up robbery tips
from other bank heist films, like Dog Day Afternoon and Reservoir Dogs (even
though the latter didn't have a robbery scene) and from Kansas' convict
mother (played by an unrecognizable Sean Young, Poor White Trash).
There are big problems with the film, most notably the bizarre gestation
period of the American Cheerleader (or Titimus Bouncimus Maximus).  Spice
starts at the beginning of the school year, but one scene where Jack
measures the growth of Diane's stomach tells us it's August.  To make things
more confusing, Diane is seven-months pregnant at Christmas.  She also
sports the fakest looking stomach in the history of film.
That said, there are still a lot of really funny one-liners, and it's pretty
entertaining to watch the girls bicker before the robbery while donned in
Betty Doll masks and matching outfits.  Spice would have made a great short
and, ironically, was directed by a woman who won an award at the 1996
Sundance Festival for a short called Pig! (Francine McDougall).  There just
isn't enough material here to justify a running time of this length.
Perhaps another robbery or two would have livened things up a bit.
1:22 - PG-13 for language, sex-related humor and some thematic elements

The ending credits do not confirm it, but it would appear that no 
cheerleaders were hurt in the making of Francine McDougall's SUGAR & 
SPICE, a cross between DROP DEAD GORGEOUS and BRING IT ON.  Sporadically 
cheesy fun, the movie is one that will probably earn such accolades as 
"not too bad" and "could have been worse" from most viewers.  First-time 
write Mandy Nelson does come up with some wickedly funny, over-the-top 
gags, but most of the time the movie coasts aimlessly along like a car 
stuck in neutral.
The five A-team cheerleaders of Lincoln High, Diane Weston (Marley 
Shelton), Kansas Hill (Mena Suvari), Hannah Wold (Rachel Blanchard), 
Lucy Whitman (Sara Marsh) and Cleo Miller (Melissa George), are a tight 
knit clique.  Even their bodies are on the same cycle.  One scene has 
them passing a tampon box from stall to stall in the restroom since they 
all get their periods at the same time.  You will be surprised and 
probably not particularly pleased to learn that this is another almost-R 
rated film that the studio has just squeezed into a PG-13 rating, like a 
hippo trying on a bikini.
Diane falls head-over-heels for the school's new quarterback, Jack 
Bartlett (James Marsden).  In a scene that works precisely because it is 
so utterly ridiculous, he runs down the field for a touchdown as she 
runs along the sidelines beside him.  As he approaches the goal line, 
they exchange "I love you"s.
This All-American couple quickly becomes personae non gratae to their 
parents when Diane gets pregnant and they decide not to get married.  
Instead, they attempt to set up their own little love nest in an 
apartment run by a sleazy hippie with a bad attitude.
"The Beatles had it wrong," Denise, who looks like Heather Graham's 
slightly younger sister, tells the rest of the squad at a slumber party.  
"Love isn't all you need."  She has the solution: rob banks.  
Approaching it like a term project, they rent tapes from THE APPLE 
DUMPLING GAME to RESERVOIR DOGS in order to acquire the necessary 
skills.  Eventually, they don Betty Doll masks and rob the small bank 
branch inside their local supermarket.
Even though it isn't worth recommending, I can unequivocally say that 
SUGAR & SPICE is better than most teen comedies.  At worst, it's merely 
boring, rather than gratingly awful.  And, hey, I laughed.  Okay, not 
often, but I did find several incidents humorous.  Given the other 
members of this film genre, this is more than might be expected.
SUGAR & SPICE runs 1:33.  It is rated PG-13 for language, sex-related 
humor and some thematic elements and would be acceptable for teenagers.
