     CAPSULE: Lots of gunplay, some humor.  The further adventures from
one of the characters from WILD AT HEART.  The title character runs
into a sexy Mexican Santeria priest and they decide to kidnap some
bland Americans and eat them.  Pretty weird stuff.  Rating: 4 (0 to
10), 0 (-4 to +4)
   - Directed by Alex de la Iglesia.
   - Rosie Perez in an obviously very counter-culture film.  Javier
     Bardem also stars as the killer and Santeria priest Romeo
     Doloroso.  Screamin' Jay Hawkins also appears.  Perez plays
     Perdita Durango, the same character played by Isabella Rossellini
     in David Lynch's WILD AT HEART.
   - No characters to identify with.  Main character wants to kidnap
     and eat people to make a statement.
   - Lots of running gags, explosions, gunplay, running gags, cars
     hitting people, and running gags.
   - A little of John Waters-like take on American culture.
   - Colorful but overly long.
   - Obviously a film that got a budget but it is not clear the
     intended audience besides hip midnight crowds.
   - Possibly lost on Canadian or American audience:  Romeo robs a bank
     disguised as Santo, a Mexican movie hero and professional
     wrestler.
   - Simon Boswell's musical score is very dramatic.
