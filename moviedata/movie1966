Truth be told, Climax is not about anything at all.
What might consume 90 seconds in any other movie is drawn out to 84
minutes here: the party scene.  Set during an anonymous suburban rager
in some guy's parents' house, the mostly-male college-age crew assemble
here to wax about their high school past, discuss the ins and outs (so
to speak) of pornography, drink a lot of beer, puke even more of it, and
play Coca-Cola baseball by taking swings at full cans of soda.
Sounds like a party to me, but a movie it really doesn't make. 
Reportedly based on surreptitious recordings of other people's party
conversations over nearly 10 years the film has a vaguely anachronistic
feeling... almost like it's based on surreptitious recordings of other
people's party conversations over nearly 10 years.  And not to nitpick,
but never have I seen so much production equipment (namely lights)
caught on camera.
Still, watching the jerks and the geeks collide over Dr. Who nostalgia
is enough fun to merit sitting through its short running time, though
its utter lack of structure may have you wishing you'd opted to spend
the night at a swanky club instead of swilling from the keg in some
guy's garage.
