This film was recently on TV (in the UK), and as I've never seen Doug and
Bobs McKenzies first (and only) film, I decided to sit through 90 mins of a
very mixed bag of jokes. 
The film starts off a bit weak, with a rather lame joke featuring the MGM
lion. We get introduced to Doug and Bob (Moranis and Thomas), who are
Canadian beer drinkers who have a tendency to go 'eh!', and call each other
'Hosers' (This film is in Hosearama)
Basically, the 'plot' goes like thus... Doug and Bob get free beers by
putting a mouse in a beer bottle, going to the beer shop saying they found
this mouse in the bottle, and then asking for a new crate of beer. However,
their plot fails in a shop, and they are told that if they want free beer,
they must go to the breweries and ask for it there. However, the two idiots
get caught up in a plot involving Brewmiester Smith (Max Von Sydow) and
must go and prove their innocence.
What follows are some funny jokes, and also some pointless, not very jokes.
This is really the main problem of the film. If you stick with the film,
then you are sure to find some good jokes. But there are far too many
misses to make it a classic comedy. However, if you ARE  a Canadian beer
drinker, then maybe you'll find some of the gags funnier then I did.
Overall, I was disappointed with this film. It even got a bit boring in
some parts of the movie, and this film could've been a lot funnier than it
was. Disappointing.
