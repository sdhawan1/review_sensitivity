 Snip-snip, Short Cuts.  Magnolia, make room.  The Decalogue, find a
different audience.  You guys have company.  This company: a 10-year,
10-film series following 10 intersecting French men and women.  The
first part of the first act in this sequence, 1999 Madeleine, is a film
that I am sure I will praise when I have seen the entire, 10-film
sequence.  It is also a film that, at this point in time, is so
incomplete, such an incompetent piece of storytelling, that part of the
audience uttered a few laughs when the words `To Be Continued' appeared
at the end.
 Such is the fate of fifteen-hour films.
 1999 Madeleine has no real story only illustrations.  It introduces
Madeleine.  Note: this is not the child Madeline.  This is a fully
adult, full-tilt lonely Madeleine.  This is a seamstress so frustrated
with her incapability to get any that suicide and personal ads seem
equally good exits to her Inferno.  Madeleine searches Paris, and
searches some more, and searches some more, and, at the end of it all,
only three plot developments have taken place: her mother is lost, her
crucifix is lost, and (hooray for Madeleine) she has gotten laid only
to be left when the man realizes the betrayal he has done his wife.
 In other words, 1999 Madeleine is absolutely wrist-slitting
depressing.  It has all of the narrative quality of an American soap
opera (not a French soap opera, which are often quite good, but an
American soap opera, which has only produced Sarah Michelle Gellar).
The only thing that makes the film bearable is the beautiful, lyric
photography in the film, care of Director Laurent Bouhnik.  The lyricism
in the shots is reminiscent of Egoyan's Exotica and The Sweet
Hereafter.  The blue matte of the film serves as a reminder of
Madeleine's constant depression, and, by extension, the constant
depression of the film itself.
 When all is said and done, however, even the photography doesn't make
this film worth watching.  The great photography has managed to sucker
me into watching all 10 of the films, in advance, and if each one of
them is as bad as 1999 Madeleine, I am going to be really, really pissed
off come 2009.
