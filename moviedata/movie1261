There is so much that can be said about a man who was so talented, that
he almost thought that he could have it all. This great play-write of
the late nineteenth century was undeniably one of the most charming men
to have graced the British Empire with his witty discourse and
intelligent writing. Yet somehow his downfall came not so much because
he was gay, but because he was selfish.
So why hasn't this movie been released in the US yet? Well I hear it has
to do something with the revealing homosexual scenes and the censorship
board. For main stream cinema this is not your average smooch between
Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline from IN AND OUT. These guys, Stephen Fry,
Jude Law etc etc really know how to kiss. I'm talking lips, tongues,
close ups you can tell they're all out, no holding back. This is not
surprising considering Stephen Fry (BLACK ADDER) has had plenty of
practice in real life prior to this excursion into male bonding. Not to
mention the numerous pretty boys' recruited to fill Oscar Wilde's bed
get to cuddle him, sit on top of him, get behind him, play with each
other in front of him. There are no close ups of any erections
travelling the ways of in and out holes, but enough to give a gay man a
hard on throughout the movie  so I hear. This is after all an art house
movie and the director would not in any way want his film mistakenly
labelled as pornographic.
So the main characters are superb in this movie. The very talented
Stephen Fry plays Wilde as naturally as he is gay and portrays the man
with great humanity and dignity. Jude Law's temperamental impersonation
of Bosey' is also memorable, but I fear the pretty lad may end up with
a price tag label wording Hire me if you need a toy boy who isn't
afraid to show butt and kiss arse.' Vanessa Redgrave puts on a very
liberal performance as the unconventional Irish mother who brought the
genius into the world, and also worth mentioning is the darling Jennifer
Ehle from TV's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, as the silent suffering wife.
An end quote from Wilde, One must do as one's nature dictates' is a
seriously flawed argument. He has overlooked factors like responsibility
and sacrifice. There are many things in life that we may want to do, but
we do not carry out these actions because the consequences are too far
reaching for all concerned. This statement is not in reference to being
gay or not being gay, but applies to everyone. Sometimes we must say NO
to the thing our very nature dictates. It has nothing to do with
sexuality, but to do with responsibility. Oscar Wilde had the
responsibility of a father and husband to fulfil. This became an
obligation when he allowed his passions to become unchecked. People will
argue that Bosey destroyed Wilde with his wanton desires, but really the
man was his own undoing when he travelled down the path of pure self
gratification with little thought of whom he hurt in due course. I think
Wilde knew that in the end his nature and poor choices destroyed the
people that mattered most, his wife and children. Perhaps if he were
never married Wilde would not appear the selfish giant he was, but the
martyr he tried to be.

     Oscar Wilde -- satirist, playwright, and novelist -- was one of the 
great figures of the late 19th century.  Born in Dublin in 1854, Wilde 
was schooled at Oxford, where he became a free-thinker and settled into 
the lifestyle of an aesthete.  In 1881, he published his first volume of 
poems and in 1882, his debut stage production, VERA, OR THE NIHILISTS 
was performed.  Thereafter, for the next 13 years, Wilde's reputation 
was in a constant state of ascension.  He published his lone novel, THE 
PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, in 1891, but is best known for four plays: LADY 
WINDERMERE'S FAN (1892), A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE (1893), AN IDEAL 
HUSBAND (1895), and THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (1895).  In 1895, 
Wilde, a known homosexual, was arrested and convicted of sodomy in 
association with his relationship with Lord Alfred ("Bosie") Douglas.  
He served two years of hard labor, but, after his release, never fully 
recovered his health and died of meningitis in 1900.  
     Like many artistic figures throughout history, Wilde's reputation 
has waxed and waned with the mutation of the social climate.  During the 
1880s and early 1890s, he was the toast of England.  Following his 
trial, he was persona non grata, and had to eke out an existence using a 
pseudonym for the rest of his life.  Into the early 20th century, his 
name was reviled, but, as the years passed and critics looked back at 
Wilde's work from a more detached perspective, his sullied reputation 
became rehabilitated.  Today, he is regarded as a literary giant, and 
perhaps the best playwright of the second half of the 19th century.
     WILDE, the new film from Brian Gilbert (TOM & VIV), is a fairly 
straightforward biographical tale that chronicles the title character's 
life from 1882, when he visited a silver mine in Colorado, until 1897, 
when he was released from prison.  Despite an uneven script and a rather 
mundane, occasionally-plodding narrative, the movie is compelling, 
largely because Wilde's life was fascinating.  Throw in a number of top-
notch performances and, even without any flourishes, the film offers a 
solid two hours of entertainment, and, for anyone unfamiliar with Wilde 
or his work, perhaps education.
     As is often the case with a movie that crams 15 years of history 
into 120 minutes (for the non-mathematical, that's only 8 minutes per 
year), there's a lack of consistency in the tone.  Certain characters 
and subplots are sadly neglected.  In particular, I was disappointed 
with the handling of Wilde's home life and marriage, which, for a man of 
his nature, was surely a point of great personal conflict and 
uncertainty.  The few brief scenes of Wilde with his wife and children 
didn't satisfy my curiosity, and the resolution of this story aspect 
felt sadly incomplete.  There are times throughout the entire film when 
subplots drag on a little too long -- the relationship between Wilde and 
Bosie is a prime example.  Ironically, despite the languid pace of much 
of the film, the last 20 to 30 minutes have a rushed feel, almost as if 
the director realized he was running out of time and wanted to compress 
as much into the proceedings as he could.  Through it all, however, 
Wilde stands tall as the magnetic central figure.  
     If there was ever an actor born to play Wilde, it's British 
thespian Stephen Fry (PETER'S FRIENDS, TV's "Jeeves and Wooster"), who 
resembles the playwright in stature and is able to deliver his 
witticisms with the perfect edge and intonation.  For Fry, this is a 
dream role -- in a recent conversation over dinner, he spoke eloquently 
and at length about his passion for Wilde and his work.  Considering the 
sprawling nature of the narrative, Fry is given a daunting task -- keep 
the audience involved in the story and anchored to the character -- that 
he carries off without seeming difficulty.
     Every bit Fry's equal is Jude Law (GATTACA), who develops Bosie 
into a truly three-dimensional individual.  Volatile, passionate, 
occasionally spiteful, and often impatient, Bosie has the kind of 
multifaceted personality that captures and holds our attention.  Law's 
careful performance makes it impossible to love or hate the man -- at 
times, he's a monster; at other times, he's an angel.  The supporting 
cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as Wilde's mother, Tom Wilkinson (THE 
FULL MONTY) as Bosie's brutish father, Michael Sheen as Wilde's first 
male lover, and a woefully underused Jennifer Ehle (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) 
as Wilde's wife.  Despite limited screen time, Ehle manages to fashion 
Connie Wilde into a heartbreakingly sympathetic character, which makes 
the truncation of that subplot all the more frustrating.
     One of the many things WILDE does right is to convey a sense of the 
man apart from his work.  During the course of the film, Wilde is often 
compared to some sort of literary prophet (he has "disciples"), and it's 
easy to see how young men would be attracted to this charming, erudite 
man who uses his "wit as a foil."  Ultimately, while WILDE lacks the 
depth and substance of the best biographical features, it's nevertheless 
a strong enough contender to deserve a trip to the local theater, 
especially with pickings so slim this summer.

    "A burnt child loves the fire," Oscar Wilde was once quoted as saying,
and these six words aptly describe his own fatal attraction to the
capricious young aristocrat Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas. It was a
relationship that would ultimately destroy Wilde's career, his family and
his health, and yet after all the damage was done, Wilde still sought
shelter in Douglas' arms.
What was the appeal? According to "Wilde," adapted by Julian Mitchell
from Richard Ellman's biography "Oscar Wilde," it seems to have been a
combination of sheer romanticism and all-consuming masochism. As portrayed
by the gifted Jude Law (Broadway's "Indiscretions," "Gattaca"), Douglas is
almost painfully handsome and often charming. But he's also very much an
overgrown rebellious adolescent, prone to temper tantrums and blistering
verbal attacks on Wilde, whom Douglas seems to regard as both unworthy of
him and also as the perfect weapon to use in his fight against his mad
father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson).
By the time he met Douglas, Wilde (Stephen Fry) was already married, a
father and a bright light in the London theater scene, thanks to the success
of "Lady Windemere's Fan." He was also already regarded by polite society as
a shady character because of his "dangerous" novel "The Picture of Dorian
Gray." "Artists care nothing about respectability," Wilde's mother (Vanessa
Redgrave) assures his wife Constance (Jennifer Ehle), who frets about
Oscar's reputation.
In his lavish telling of a tragic story, director Brian Gilbert holds
back very little. "Wilde" does not shy away from showing either Wilde and
Douglas carousing in all-male brothels ("I do love you, Oscar, but variety
is the spice of life," Douglas huffs as he leads Wilde in) or Wilde's
voyeuristic habits.
The film also makes no attempt to conceal the walking paradox that was
Wilde himself. Wilde's story "The Selfish Giant" becomes a recurring motif
in the scenes showing Wilde's family life: Although he could write a lovely
fable about the virtues of being generous, Wilde is depicted as a father too
absorbed in his work and love affairs to pay much attention to his sons.
Even more pointedly, although the Irish-born author insists "all my
life I've fought against the English vice, hypocrisy," Wilde refused to
publicly admit his homosexuality, even going so far as to sue for libel
after the Marquess wrote a note alleging he was a "sodomite." The lawsuit --
prompted, of course, by Douglas' hatred of his father -- would ultimately
disgrace Wilde and everyone around him.
Fry brings the vulnerable soul beneath Wilde's scathing wit to the
surface, making it clear that even though Wilde realized his relationship
with Douglas was futile ("you're my catstrophe, my doom," he murmurs to
Douglas between kisses) he was powerless to resist. Fry also captures
Wilde's poise and imposing physical presence: He truly was the Selfish
Giant, not the paunchy little man he's often portrayed as. Law, quickly
becoming an actor to watch, has the necessary allure and off-putting
petulance the character of Douglas requires, and Wilkinson is suitably
frenzied as his bloodthirsty dad.

In an electrifying performance that has "Oscar" (no pun!) written all
over it, Stephan Fry brings to life Oscar Wilde in this new film about
this most remarkable (again, no pun) man.   Fry's portrayal will come
as no surprise to those who remember him for his performances in COLD
COMFORT FARM, A FISH CALLED WANDA, I.Q., PETER'S FRIENDS, as well as
his unruffable Jeeves.   In this version of Wilde, we see the many
facets that brought Wilde to the attention of the world.
Despite  a most flashy style of dress and demeanor that was shown to
his admiring public, in private life his manner was that of a devoted
family man to his  dearly beloved wife, Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and
his two children.   In a weak moment, however, a young guest seduced
him, making him  aware of his homosexuality that had been kept in
abeyance since his school days when he first became conscious of it.
When later, at the age of 38,  he met the very handsome Lord Alfred
Douglas, a 22-year-old Oxford graduate, he entered the path that in a
Victorian age with its strong anti-gay bias could only lead to his
downfall.   When his new friend introduced him to "rent boys," male
prostitutes, it inevitably lead him further to neglect his wife and
children and culminated in a disgracing jail sentence for "lewd
conduct" with men.
Despite the passion for his male friends and his new life, he remained
a most popular author and wit.   Some of his better-known works
included books and plays: LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN, THE IMPORTANCE OF
BEING EARNEST,   THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY .    Among his many
witticisms, perhaps the best known are: "In this world there are only
two tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other is
getting it."   "To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance."   "We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at
the stars."   "There is no sin except stupidity."   "The only way to
get rid of a temptation is to yield to it."
The film story of Oscar Wilde is beautifully brought to life  because
of its excellent cast.    With Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer
Ehle, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Michael Sheen, Zoe Wanamker and Tom
Wilkinson doing the honors of supporting Fry, the film is sheer
perfection.

It seems a trend in modern works about Oscar Wilde to narrow him down
to nothing but a man ruined by his homosexuality. "Wilde", which
opened friday, can't be excluded from that group. Both San Francisco
and Broadway in NY have a play called "Gross Indecency" about the
trial surrounding Oscar Wilde's sexual affairs with younger men. SF
also had a one man show last winter that focused largely on the
torment he had to endure because of his sexuality. What "Wilde" and
all these other plays forget is that behind this "scandal" was a
brilliant, witty and successful writer in the late 19th century who
contributed to world literature.
The first 30 minutes of "Wilde" does nothing but pound into the
viewers heads that the character is indeed homosexual in spite of his
wife and two children. Moderation was not used to introduce it. Each
scene of social and family events seemed intercut with homosexual love
scenes. After the first half hour, I found that the film up to that
point lacked focus and drive. I wondered where it was going, and if it
was going to live up to it's name. After all, a film simply named
after a real person should cover that person's life, their personality
and what was important about them, or at least how their work
influenced culture. "Wilde" has the amazing ability to turn such a
fascinating man into a nobody. Oscar Wilde did not need to be the
focus of this film, and, should you decide that you want to see this
to learn more about him, you will be disappointed. The story is one of
a man who has a social status and how his sexual affairs with younger
men, one in particular, ends up ruining him. The fact that he is Oscar
Wilde, playwrite, poet and author, seems secondary. The successful
opening nights of "Lady Windermere's Fan" and "The Importance of Being
Earnest" as well as references to "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and
"Solome" are tossed in to remind the viewer who they are watching.
Stephen Fry did a fine job of portraying the tormented writer, but his
talent seemed wasted on a character who never lived up to what the
real man really was. Jude Law played his younger lover, Lord Alfred
Douglas, "Bosie" as he is known, quite well. His performance as a
snotty, slutty pretty boy is another thing that makes the film
watchable.
Perhaps a year of anticipation of a film about the life and times of
Oscar Wilde in which the lead role would be played by one of my
favorite British comics, had something to do with the letdown, but not
much. The costumes are glorious, the sets decadent and the
performances good, but "Wilde" does not hold together as anything
other than a preachy film about how difficult it was to be homosexual
120 years ago. I am still waiting for a production about a man who was
known for his wit and intelligence, a true artist, rather than the men
he slept with.

Von einem Film ueber das Leben des englischen Schriftstellers und
Dramatikers Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900) haette ich mehr erwartet. Zum
Beispiel das Psychogramm eines brillanten, homosexuellen
Nonkonformisten im Viktorianischen Zeitalter. Mir waere auch die
Geschichte einer obsessiven Liebesbeziehung unter Maennern recht
gewesen. Eine Darstellung heutiger Zustaende und Vorurteile im
historischen Gewand? Warum nicht?
Doch leider verspricht der Film mehr als er halten kann. "Oscar Wilde
- Der erste moderne Mann"? Mag sein. Im Film wird dergleichen nicht
deutlich.
"Oscar Wilde" beginnt mit dem spaeten coming-out des bereits
gefeierten Autors und Familienvaters. Befreit "wie nach dem Fall von
Belagerungsmauern" lebt er seine neu entdeckte Lust in den Armen
verschiedener junger Maenner aus. Schliesslich findet er sein
Schicksal in der Gestalt des betoerend schoenen Adligen Lord Alfred
Douglas ("Bosie"). Er laesst sich in den Konflikt des Jungen mit
seinem homophoben Vater hineinziehen. Es kommt zum oeffentlichen
Skandal. Oscar Wilde verbringt zwei Jahre hinter Zuchthausmauern, von
denen er sich nicht mehr erholt.
Trotz der Idealbesetzung der Titelrolle mit dem wunderbaren Stephen
Fry erfahren wir zu wenig ueber die Person Oscar Wildes, um uns
wirklich fuer ihn zu interessieren. Er ist uns sympathisch, doch sein
Innenleben bleibt ein Raetsel. Noch unschaerfer treten uns die
uebrigen Figuren des Films entgegen, obwohl auch hier erstklassige
Darsteller am Werk sind (z.B. Vanessa Redgrave).
Der Film konzentriert sich ausschliesslich auf Wildes Umtriebe in der
schwulen Nische der englischen upper-class. Dort sind die gezeigten
Zustaende derart "modern", dass ausgerechnet Wilde den groessten Teil
des Films fuer den heutigen Betrachter wie ein Spiesser wirkt. Die
ganze Ungeheuerlichkeit von Wildes Lebensstil im ausgehenden 19.
Jahrhundert wird uns erst ansatzweise bei der legendaeren
Gerichtsverhandlung bewusst. Zu spaet fuer den Film.
Ueber den Schauplatz und die Zeit von "Oscar Wilde" erfahren wir
wenig, trotz der sorgfaeltigen Ausstattung. Wer ueber die Enge und die
strengen Regeln des Alten England etwas wissen will, ist mit einem
Film wie "Sense and Sensibility" besser bedient. Ueber Obsessionen hat
man auch schon beeindruckendere Filme gesehen, ebenso ueber schwule
Liebe in welcher Zeit auch immer.
So ist der Film weder fuer Kenner Wildes und der damaligen Zeit zu
empfehlen, noch fuer jene, denen das Sujet voellig fremd ist.
Auch Voyeure seien entschieden gewarnt: Wer sich nicht gerade ueber
den Anblick der nackten Rueckseite eines gut gewachsenen jungen Kerls
auf- oder erregen kann, hat auch nichts zu glotzen.
Insgesamt eine schoen fotografierte, ueber weite Strecken langweilige
Enttaeuschung mit einem allerdings idealen Hauptdarsteller.

    Oscar Wilde once said "In this world there are only two
tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other
is getting it."  This can be paraphrased by a similar axiom,
"Don't wish too hard for what you want.  You may get it." 
Why is this philosophy the central conceit of "Wilde," a
heartfelt biopic of the great 19th-century writer's later years? 
Simply this. Wilde was married to a woman he loved and was
devoted to the children he had with her.  Had he remained
faithful while dashing off successful plays like "The
Importance of Being Earnest" and stories like "The Picture of
Dorian Gray," his tragedy would be his failure to give in to his
deeply felt homosexual longings.  He would, in fact, be the
very hypocrite he disparaged in another marvelous theatrical
piece, "Lady Windermere's Fan," which uncovers a scandal
that threatens the idyllic early married life of Lord and Lady
Windermere in turn-of-the-century London.  To avoid the
tragedy of hypocrisy, he gives in to his natural inclination--his
love for his fellow man--is found out, disgraced, tried for
violation of England's sodomy laws and imprisoned at hard
labor for two years.  
   Yet the anguish which afflicted him could have been
avoided.  Wilde could have continued enjoying his double life,
retaining the loyalty of his devoted wife, had he not blown his
cool and attacked one of the most powerful people in London
society.  "Wilde" is the story of the fatal flaw that not only
propelled the writer's downfall but contributed directly to his
death at the age of 46.
   As portrayed by Stephen Fry--whose formidably large
demeanor is strikingly similar to the writer's--Wilde is a
colossus of a man whose wit matches his height and girth
and whose appeal is so broad-based that he can wow a
crowd of Colorado miners as easily as he captures the
attention of London bluebloods.  The film opens, surprisingly
enough, in the Wild West, where Wilde delivers a talk on
Socrates to a rapt body of grimy workers in a Leadville,
Colorado quarry in 1882.  After completing a one-year's
lecture tour in the U.S. and Canada, he is wed to the lovely
Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and has two sons, though it's
obvious from the way he had looked at the bare-chested
fellows in Colorado he has yet to mine nature's entreaties to
indulge in the sensuous company of men.  Enlightenment
arrives in the form of a Canadian guest, Robbie Ross
(Michael Sheen), who intuits the writer's bent and exposes
himself while Constance is bedding her two sons.
   As though to demonstrate the theory that it's not what you
do that matters to anyone, it's what you appear to others to
be doing, Wilde's alleged activities in male dens of iniquity
cause society to buzz while at the same time the well-heeled
of London flock to his plays, enjoying the manner by which
the author satirizes the hypocritical customs of the upper
class.  It becomes apparent that the so-called rent boys with
whom he fraternizes can safely ignore the country's laws
against homosexuality since they are young and cast a low
profile outside their usual haunts.  Wilde's fall from grace
begins when he is introduced to the dashingly handsome but
petulant and promiscuous Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie (Jude
Law), who hates his homophobic father and thereby insists on
flaunting his relationship with the author.  When Bose's dad,
the miserable Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson),
discovers the liaison, he threatens to cut his son off from the
estate and poison-pens the writer, accusing him of being a
sodomite.  Wilde goes ballistic, unsuccessfully sues the
cantankerous and much-feared patrician, and is himself
charged with criminal violation of England's anti-
homosexuality laws.  Jailed at hard labor for two years by a
judge who treats the poor man as though he were a serial
killer, Wilde suffers a physical decline, his creativity all but
destroyed.
   Though director Brian Gilbert's name has hardly been a
household word, his "Wilde" is conclusively the best of the
three accounts of the author's life to date.  Ken Hughes's
"The Trial of Oscar Wilds" (1960) was a triumph for Peter
Finch in the title role and "Oscar Wilde," released at the same
time by Gregory Ratoff, displayed an ideally cast Robert
Morley as the hapless essayist.  This production, however, is
particularly blessed by featuring a man who resembles the
writer most closely and moves the audience all the more
because it focuses on Wilde's continued love for his enduring
wife and for the children he was ultimately forbidden to see. 
Nothing in the version thirty-eight years ago boasts the gloss
of the opening, unconventional scene in the American West,
nor can the previous versions strut absolutely stellar
supporting roles such as those of "Pride and Prejudice"'s
Jennifer Ehle as wife Constance, blond god Jude Law as the
love of Oscar's life, and Tom Wilkinson as the disagreeable
marquess.  As a result, Wilde's wit comes across most
sharply, and we are motivated to read works featuring such
bon mots as: "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to
yield to it," "Work is the curse of the drinking class," and the
especially pertinent one, "A man cannot be too careful in the
choice of his enemies."  Not Rated.  Running time: 115
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998

Because I take for granted that Oscar Wilde the writer, the man and his wit
are familiar to the film's potential public, I will not go into a general
intro. Wilde's homosexuality (a crime under English law until the late
1960s), his famous affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, and the ensuing trials
that finished off poor Oscar, have made him a "cause celebre" --if I am not
mistaken, the first of that nature in modern history. Understandably,all
this has made of Wilde a patron saint of gay artists.
Among the many cinema genres, few can be as difficult and as vulnerable to
criticism as the biographical picture. Biopics are compromises. To relate a
life -- or part of one -- and remain faithful to history in two hours of
film is an impossibility, one that is even nastier than screen adaptations
of major novels. Condensations, simplifications, selected episodes are
unavoidable.
A case in point is the set of biopics directed by William Dieterle in the
1930s and early 1940s. They were all reverent works on major figures: Louis
Pasteur (with Paul Muni, Oscared), Florence Nightingale, Emile Zola (Best
Picture 1937, also with Muni), Juarez (with Muni), Reuter (with
E.G.Robinson), Dr. Erlich (Robinson) Well-made, using major actors in both
main and supporting roles, these works were big popular hits in their time.
But today, with  audiences and critics, movies in that style would get a
much more cautious reception. Even the sacrosanct epic "Napoleon" (1927, by
Abel Gance) might be --but is not-- faulted for historical inaccuracies.
Dieterle and his likes represented the old school of biopics. After a
transition period (e.g. Wilson, The Desert Fox, Viva Zapata) came the new
school, in which no two of the better films followed the same strategy.
Creative and unconventional treatments days were given so such masterful
works as --and I cite a few pell-mell --Raging Bull, Van Gogh, Chaplin, Joe
Hill, Lenny, Lawrence of Arabia, Malcolm X, Tous les Matins du Monde,
Vincent and Theo, Stevie, Camille Claudel, Rosa Luxemburg, Hanussen, An
Angel at My Table, Ed Wood...
Although Wilde, was not an easy item to tackle, it acquits itself
honorably. There must have been good rapport between director and writer.
Brian Gilbert, who made the funny, witty Vice Versa, the underrated Not
Without My Daughter, then Tom and Viv, opted here for a Masterpiece
Theatre/Ivory-Merchant style, unrevolutionary but fitting the subject.
Versatile novelist-playwright Julian Mitchell is the author of many
scenarios, including those of Arabesque, Another Country, Vincent and Theo,
August (the directorial debut of Anthony Hopkins)-- not to mention nine
episodes of that civilized delight, the Inspector Morse TV series.
Mitchell had already worked on another gay theme I know of, in his
prize-winning stage-play  Another Country which is about  1930s students
public-school students for whom homosexuality was trendy. Years later, as
in the notorious Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean case, several government
officials were found spying for the Soviet Union. A very good film was made
of this. It starred Rupert Everett. The script was by Mitchell.
For the current movie --the third about Wilde--  Mitchell  based his
scenario on the admirable biography by Richard Ellmann. The great scholar
and critic  finished this long labor of love as he was dying of Lou Gehrig'
s disease.He died in March 1987. The book appeared in early 1988. There is
no way for a film script to reconstruct a 680-page volume. The scenario
wisely opted for  selective choices and inspirations. It is faithful to
Ellmann's belief that Wilde was as original and major  a writer, and a
cultural influence, as he was a man who invented his own public persona, as
wit, esthete, dandy, poseur, society lion and, among much else, a sly
critic of the middle and upper classes of England, the very people who were
the butt of Wilde's plays yet applauded them.
The film does not go into Wilde's Irish and English past and upbringing. It
plunges right away into an already established Oscar who marries Constance.
His wife, in older parlance "gave him two boys".
Robert Ross, a younger houseguest, reveals to Wilde that he (Oscar) is
really a homosexual. A relationship starts between the two. It is followed
by others, culminates in the love affair between Wilde and handsome, some
20 years younger Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie").
It's a bizarre affair. Oscar's love is steadfast, while the capricious,
self-spoiled Bosie blows hot and cold, introduces Oscar to lower class
people, often insults, hurts, exploits, taunts him and is despicable. He
flaunts their couple in public,also taunts his father. The latter, played
by Tom Wilkinson --who has a very different role in The Full Monty-- is
here the wealthy Marquess of Queensberry, a crude, rude, violent sportsman
whom Bosie hates. (He is the same Lord Queensberry after whom the basic
codes for boxing were named, although another sportsman wrote them).
Delightful is the movie's inclusion of some aspects of Wilde's enormously
growing fame as a playwright, plus much Wildean humor, wit, and the
expected Wildean thoughts and epigrams. But concurrently as well as
exponentially, we see the sadness of the man's public and private life, the
unavoidable troubles and scandals. The tragedy, latent throughout the
writer's life, now springs out of the closet. It becomes all the more
painful to watch since Wilde is a most likable fellow, generous to a fault,
and never really inflicting harm or hurt on others.
Actor Stephen Fry is an uncanny match for Wilde. He even looks like him,
though taller, less rotund, and with a face not so soft as in the
photographs of Wilde. Fry, also a writer and a wit, temperamental,
unpredictable, rather sweet, openly gay, is a rare case of perfect casting.
Superior too is the casting of Lord Alfred Douglas and that of  Robert
Ross. Robbie remains through thick and thin Oscar's true friend and helper,
and the voice of reason.
Because we know how everything comes out, the earlier and/or some lighter
scenes are made suspenseful as we wait for the axe to fall. And we wish
that the so-smart Oscar had not been so dumb as to be prodded by Bosie into
initiating that terrible libel suit against Queensberry. If there was a
time when "don't ask, don't tell" was the best possible advice, it was in
Victorian days.

I think that the greatness of a person can be judged in how much of a
bullshit artist they are, the least being more commendable.  In that
respect, playwright/philosopher/world's most famous bisexual Oscar Wilde is
definitely one of history's most commendable presences, right up there with
Thomas More as people who stayed completely true to who they were, no
matter what the consequences...and of course, there were consequences. 
This is just one of two things that the biopic on his life, "Wilde" is
trying to say, the other being that no matter what the time period, a man
like Oscar Wilde cannot exist on the world for a wide variety of reasons.
The film chronicles the latter years of his life, starting in 1882 during
his one year trip to America, and then showing him in the prime of his
life, when he wrote his only novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray," and
numerous plays, such as "Lady Windermere's Fan" and "The Importance of
Being Earnest."  But unlike most authors and playwrights, Wilde was as
dynamic and witty as the plays he wrote.  As played to total perfection by
Stephen Fry, a big fan of Wilde's work, Oscar is probably the most charming
man to ever walk the earth, as well as the greatest conversationalist, at
least of his time.  He can charm anyone, even the most ignorant brutes, and
has the ability to shoot out intelligent, aphoritic one-liners on cue, such
as "It's appalling what people do in front of works of art," and "Alcohol,
taken in large quantities, can bring about all the effects of drunkeness"
(I'm paraphrasing here).
What some encyclopedias and various history books leave out, though, is
that Oscar was one of the very first widely known open homosexuals.  The
film shows what may be his fictitious epiphany when a visitor to his house,
Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen), seduces Oscar once his wife, Constance
(Jennifer Ehle), is asleep, and ends up carrying on a short-lived affair
with him.  After a couple other suitors, Oscar falls deeply in love with
Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas (Jude Law, the bitter, scene-stealing cripple
from "Gattaca"), an incredibly selfish, sometimes ill-tempered young man
who captures Oscar's heart because: a) he thinks he's so beautiful that
he's a work of art, and Oscar is obsessed with beauty in art; and b)
because he generally feels bad for what a hard life he's had so far.
The film plays two ways: as a literal lifeline of Oscar's life, showing his
plays being written, and depicting his tragic downfall; and as every biopic
should be told, as a parable for our own lives.  Every great biopic finds
some way of connecting the people they glamorize to our own lives, and the
film views Oscar as the thing we all should be, and the thing we can never
be.  His life, at least the better part of it, is a wonderful dream, where
we discover who we really are, and instead of doing things we never want to
do, we be what we think we are.  Oscar discovered who he was in the middle
of his life, and from that point on, decided to live life to the fullest.
But the film depicts the reason why this is a fantasy-like fallacy, showing
Oscar as one of the world's great selfish people.  Characters pop up from
time to time, are given a lot of attention, and then disappear for long
amounts of time, reappearing for a brief scene of two, then disappearing
again.  Characters like his patient wife, who has had two kids with him,
and wishes him to come home, hardly sees him, and the movie sometimes seems
to forget her.  The same goes for Robbie Ross, who, despite knowing that he
was merely the man who opened up Oscar to homosexuality, remains totally
loyal to him, and tries to help in the later years of his life.
Despite a few shortcomings, "Wilde" is a magnificently film, filled with a
sometimes sensual feeling, and filled with the same way of looking at
history as "A Man for All Seasons" did.  The sets and costumes are
beautifully lavish, the cinematography is utterly gorgeous, and even the
numerous gay love scenes are tastefully handled, never seeming a bit like
pornography.  And we see a wonderful, loving portrait of Oscar Wilde, who's
own time was not kind to him, but who's seen that history has seen him as
almost a martyr for true self identity.  Yes, you can easily point out that
the way he lived was selfish, and that his downfall was not really Bosie's
fault but really his, but you can't deny that you wish that you could
discover yourself like Oscar did, and have the courage to act on it.  This
is why Oscar Wilde is viewed so favorly in history, and why someone lke
Bosie, who was a homosexual more out of revenge against his tyrannical
father (Tom Wilkinson from "The Full Monty") and society as well, is viewed
as merely "at one time the object of Oscar Wilde's affections."
One more final note, actually more of a redundant note, in all actuality,
should be made towards Stephen Fry, who plays Oscar Wilde (I can't believe
that I almost forgot to praise him more).  Fry's performance is probably
the most natural and dead-on performance I have seen in a very long time,
and I'm starting the campaign now to get him nominated for an Oscar. 
Folks, you will probably not see a better performance this year by an
actor, because, for all intensive purposes, Stephen Fry IS Oscar Wilde, and
every time I read Wilde's literature or hear one of his hilarious
aphorisms, I will hear the voice of Fry.  That is all.

     "In this life there are only two tragedies," Oscar Wilde reflects
at the end of the new film about his life, entitled simply WILDE.  "One
is not getting what one wants.  The other is getting it."
     WILDE is neither the tragedy nor the comedy that audiences may be
expecting, although it certainly includes doses of both.  It is first
and foremost a celebration of the joy of life.  Even if his life did
turn horribly tragic in the end, Wilde lived it with great gusto up
until then, and audiences are apt to find this sublime picture just as
wonderfully satisfying as Wilde found the majority of his life.
     Stephen Fry, last seen as the judge in THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS,
gives a mesmerizing and highly nuanced performance as Wilde.  So
utterly natural in his acting, Fry becomes Wilde.  In a performance
worthy of Oscar consideration, Fry plays a man who was a doting father,
a loving husband, and a lover to a string of young men -- called boys
back then although they seem to be in their early twenties.  Wilde
referred to this love of young men by older ones as "the love that dare
not speak its name."
     After opening incongruously in the Wild West of an 1882 Colorado
mining town where the famous writer Wilde is on tour, the movie moves
to London, where his plays are becoming great successes.  "You really
must be careful, you're in great danger of becoming rich," his friend
Ada (Zoe Wanamaker) warns him.  Wilde ignores all warnings and lives
his life as if nothing is forbidden and everything is possible.  His
public loves him, and he loves them and everything in life.
     With a loyal and affectionate wife named Constance, played sweetly
by Jennifer Ehle, he fathers children whom he adores.  He is delighted,
however, to learn of his desires for relationships, both emotionally
and sexually, with men, especially young men.  ("I feel like a city
that's been under siege for twenty years, and suddenly the gates are
thrown open.")
     One day Wilde locks eyes with the handsome, young Lord Alfred
Douglas, a.k.a., Bosie, and they are both instantly smitten.  Jude Law
from GATTACA delivers an emotionally complex performance as Bosie.  A
man who has too much money ("No gentleman ever has the slightest idea
of what his bank balance is."), Bosie comes from an abysmally
dysfunctional family.
     In a compete change of pace, Tom Wilkinson from THE FULL MONTY
plays the angry and vicious Marquess of Queensberry, who is Bosie's
violent father.  The marquess hates Wilde both because of his affair
with his son and because Wilde is so disarmingly charming.  ("Men
shouldn't be charming," he complains.  "It's disgusting!")
     The warm and intimate cinematography by Martin Fuhrer contrasts
nicely with the subtly flamboyant costumes by Nic Ede.  The result is
an inviting picture that becomes more captivating with each moment.
     Director Brian Gilbert stages each scene with delicate precision.
The sex scenes are handled tastefully, showing enough romantic passion
that it is crystal clear what is happening, but without ever letting
the movie lapse into some tawdry, soft porn film.  The resulting
careful balance will likely leave audiences neither offended nor
disappointed.  You can feel Wilde's ardor for both sexes and the heavy,
open mouth kissing - there are more explicit scenes - manages to convey
it most effectively.
     When Wilde ends up being thrown in prison for his sexual
encounters, his witty barbs finally stop, and for once he ceases to
enjoy life.  Fry's bravado performance works as well in the latter
episodes of great poignancy as they do during his earlier revelry.  The
utterly exquisite picture is enthralling from beginning to end.  Even
if it ends in tragedy, Wilde's earlier felicity is likely to be the
emotion that viewers take away.
     WILDE runs 1:57.  It is rated R for profanity, nudity and strong
sexuality and would fine for older and mature teenagers.

Cast:        Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer Ehle
Running Time: 117 minutes
Unlike the United States, Brian Gilbert's bio-pic WILDE has been released
in Australia and for those living in the U.S, I have written a short review
to whet your appetite until the film arrives on your shores. The delay in
the U.S. distributor closing a deal on the film may have something to do
with a handful of rather explicit homosexual scenes. Although it must be
said, explicit only for the mainstream set; the arthouse cinema goers will
hardly raise an eyebrow, no pun intended.
If you though a big deal was made about Ellen DeGeneres coming out, then
you should see what happens to Oscar Wilde. Brian Gilbert's bio-pic of
Oscar Wilde begins like a gay tribute to a great writer. We see Oscar
Wilde's (Stephen Fry) penchant for young men and his sudden breakthrough of
the personal and social barriers that prevented him from fulfilling his
latent homosexual desires. Oscar's dilemma is made all the more difficult
because, you see, Oscar is married to Constance Lloyd (Jennifer Ehle) and
they have two children. Once his sexual desires are unleashed, however,
Oscar is cruising the streets for all the prime meat he can get his hands
on.
That is, until he meets Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law) or as his close-knit
friends call him, Bosie. They strike up an immediate attraction and before
you know it, they're in the sack, raising some serious sweat. At first,
they seem to be enjoying themselves going out to dinner and gay clubs
(similar to today's gatherings but without the techno dance music).
However, things begin to get ugly when Bosie's father, the wicked Marquess
of Queensberry, sets upon destroying Oscar by taking him to court for
charges of gross indecency (that is, for being gay). However, the real
reason for the court action probably lies in the Marquess' inability to
love his son in the caring way that Oscar is able to. The court action
leads to imprisonment and we are left to ponder, once again, how cruel
history can be.
Brian Gilbert has attempted to tell this story of Oscar Wilde in a very
noble manner. Oscar is painted as being the first truly, sensitive, new-age
guy while the conservative establishment is seen as a sinister, prejudicial
lot. At the beginning of the film, we see a happy-go-lucky Oscar walk
through a horde of uniformed legal representatives as a signal of his
future disregard for the establishment (ah, symbolism!). Wilde's constant
outpour of razor-sharp witticisms are a pleasure to the ears and Stephen
Fry's endearing performance ensures that we are made to feel pity for him
throughout his ordeal while we seethe at the evilness of the people
persecuting him. 
The main problem with the film lies in the depiction of Wilde himself.
Despite Stephen Fry's breakthrough performance, we are still none the wiser
as to the inner thoughts of Wilde. The film is all too quick to jump
straight into Wilde's foray into homosexuality without giving us a
foundation of his previous life to compare and contrast. Fry was good at
giving us the droopy eye look whenever Oscar felt any emotion but the film
needed some more background on Oscar and why, all of a sudden, he turned
from Robert Young to Mr. Brady. Okay, we know he loved Bosie but why did he
always go back to him when everyone else, but he, could see that Bosie was
an insecure, spoilt brat who caused nothing but mayhem to all those who
knew him. Is love really that blind? I know that Bosie was attractive and I
know that the director thought so too because we kept seeing Bosie's
athletic buns. In fact, all the gay men were handsome with great bodies
while Oscar had the face of Jay Leno and the body of, well, Jay Leno. No
doubt Bosie's love was blind as well.
Although the homosexual scenes may cause a stir among mainstream audiences,
they are rather timid when compared to some of the independent films shown
at gay and lesbian festivals. The Melbourne premiere screening of this film
resembled the opening night of the Mardi Gras. I haven't seen so many gay
people at a screening since PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT. Being an
extremely, right-wing, breast-loving, heterosexual male myself, I must say
the first male-to-male kiss caught me off guard. I am so used to seeing
gorgeous blondes being toungued by George Clooney that I wasn't prepared
for this homosexual tryst. However, as the film progressed, I became quite
used to it. In fact, by the fifth sex scene where two men are pounding away
in, amazingly, the missionary position, I forgot what a naked woman looked
like.
WILDE is definitely worth catching for Stephen Fry's performance alone but,
overall, Oscar Wilde still remains a mystery to me as the film did not
manage to explain or delve into the inner psyche of this great writer. It
tread the surface while depicting his downward spiral from fame and fortune
to obscurity and exile. However, I did walk away with a better knowledge of
Bosie and his motivations and the ugly presence of homophobia in late
1800's England and that society hasn't really changed that much. We've just
become better at hiding our prejudices.
