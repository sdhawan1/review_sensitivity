FREQUENCY (director: Gregory Hoblit; screenwriter: Toby Emmerich;
cinematographer: Alar Kivilo; editor: David Rosenbloom;cast: Dennis
Quaid (Frank Sullivan), Jim Caviezel (John Sullivan), Noah Emmerich
(Gordo Hersch),  Shawn Doyle (Jack Shepard ), Elizabeth Mitchell (Julia
Sullivan), Andre Braugher (Satch DeLeon), Jordan Bridges (Graham
Gibson), Melissa Errico (Samantha Thomas), Daniel Henson (Johnny
Sullivan (6 years)), 2000)
A far-fetched and schmaltzy Hollywood-style mainstream tale about time
travel. Frank Sullivan as played by Dennis Quaid, the man permanently
blessed with the benign Jack Nicholson smile, is a heroic firefighter
living in Bayside, Queens, which is a nice middle-class area with
private homes, one next to the other.
Frank died in a fire at an abandoned warehouse on October 12, 1969, but
hold onto your N.Y. Mets baseball cap for this one, his son makes
contact via a Heathkit ham radio (those cheap kind that were built from
a kit) with his deceased father on October 10, 1999. The son, John (Jim
Caviezel), is now 36-years-old and is a police homicide detective, still
living in the same house he was born in. The explanation for this
phenomena occurring, causing them to transmit via short-wave radio and
have contact with one another while not seeing each other even though
they are transmitting in the same house, is that there were two freak
electrical storms occurring thirty years apart during an aurora borealis
-- the Northern Lights -- which somehow interacted with the ham radio
and enabled them to communicate (right!). You are also asked to swallow
this additional pill: after confirming that he is speaking with his
father, he gives his dad information via the ham radio that will now
allow him to escape from the abandoned warehouse fire and avoid his
death.
To buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe, one has to have a suspension
of disbelief and of all rational thought.
The plot continues in this vein of time travel and tells how father and
son team up to stop a serial killer, altering events that already
happened by rewriting the past. If the catch-the-killer subplot had any
real suspense to it, I might have bit more for this nonsense storyline.
But that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average TV
detective show. As a result, the film veers away from what made it so
appealing in the first place, a father and son who didn't know each
other have been given another chance through the ham radio, to have a
meaningful relationship. But this story is unfortunately overtaken by
its weak serial killer story. Thereby, the film is reduced to
overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth
between past and future events, sloppily changing one for the other,
until nothing made sense, since you have to keep changing both
simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish
that storyline with accurate details.
If you buy into the premise, which is the only way to sit through this
film, then you will be rewarded by the following subplots: a lot of
baseball nostalgia about those "Amazin'" Mets winning the 1969 World
Series; seeing an endearing relationship develop between father and son,
that is filled with mutual love; preventing the so-called Nightingale
serial killer the opportunity to kill all the 10 nurses he supposedly
killed, including John's mother; watching the NYFD in action fighting
fires; and, lastly, you might feel that there is hope even after death
of seeing your loved ones coming back as much as thirty years later and
even playing softball with you, which makes this the ultra in feel-good
movie. Oh, yeah, you also get tips on future stocks, like Yahoo!, which
you can take that inside time travel tip to your future stock broker and
eventually buy a Mercedes Benz with the killing you'll make in the
market.
The acting was surprisingly good, despite the poor script. Dennis Quaid
is a throwback father  -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate.
James Caviezel is convincing as a possible alcoholic, a moody workaholic
detective, and someone unhappy with his unmarried life, feeling that
there is something missing in his life. Able supporting roles are
provided by: "Homicide's" Andre Brougher as a detective--he is Frank's
best friend and John's current boss, Noah Emmerich is John's best friend
and neighbor from his childhood (he is the brother of the screenwriter),
Shawn Doyle makes for a creepy serial killer, and Elizabeth Mitchell
sweetly plays her one-dimensional role as Frank's wife Julia, a
wonderful mother to John, a dedicated nurse, and a potential victim of
the serial killer.
If the film did one thing right, it showed a family that was really
together and good to see on the screen, especially with all the recent
films mostly showing only dysfunctional families. It was refreshing to
see one for a change with a father as a good role model, even if some
might find this relationship too corny.
Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear/Fallen) has fallen into the trap of going
overboard in his use of sentimentality, which overtakes the film and
makes it too gooey for comfort. Also, his directing suffers from an
inability to tell a good detective story, even if his idea on time
travel is intriguing. Unfortunately, the time travel story does not hold
up to any intelligent scrutiny. So what is left, is a movie that should
find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship
meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining.

If there is one thing that science-fiction movies love to grapple with, it
is the possibility of time travel. According to most Hollywood writers,
there seem to be two different ways of dealing with time travel. Either the
past can be altered and the future improved, as in the "Terminator" movies,
or the seldom used possibility that the past cannot be changed, as explored
in Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys". "Frequency", the new film from director
Gregory Hoblit ("Primal Fear"), is a movie which falls under the first
category yet it is different from most films like this; we are able to see
the effects of changes to the past on the future as they occur. For example,
we get interesting scenes like one in which a character in the past burns a
message into a desk, while a person in the future watches the words appear.
However, "Frequency" does not attempt to deal with the paradox problems
which arise when dealing with time travel. You'll have to decide for
yourself if this was a good idea.
John Sullivan (James Caviezel) is a burned out cop (burned out cop seems to
be a common profession) who is having marital problems with his wife,
Samantha (Melissa Errico). One evening, while drowning away his miseries
with beer, he stumbles across his father's old ham radio. John turns it on
and discovers that he can somehow use it to communicate back through time
and speak to his father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), who has been dead
for thirty years. While the two are, at first, disbelieving what has
happened, they are soon catching up like old friends. John finds that he may
be able to save his father's life if he can warn him about the accident
which will soon claim it. While John does manage to save his father's life,
it alters the future in ways which he could never have forseen.
For all you fanatical sci-fi fans out there, I'd best warn you that certain
things are never explained in this movie. The ham radio being able to
communicate back in time is only explained as having to do with massive
solar activity at the time, which isn't much of a scientific explanation.
The time paradox, which would be created by changing the past, is never even
brought up. A time paradox would be something like this: If a person is not
originally killed in the past, and a person in the future changes it so that
person is killed in the past, he wouldn't have existed in the future for the
person in the future to try and change the past. In other words, this is the
sort of thing which you can think about forever and it just goes around in
circles. This is why I personally think it's best that the movie didn't try
to explain it. Besides, you'll be having far too much fun with the rest of
the film to care about little plot inconsistencies like that.
The nice thing about a movie like this, which has no big name stars (except
the always underrated Dennis Quaid), is that it is forced to rely upon a
good script to draw a crowd. Afterall, last year's godawful "Wild Wild West"
proved that a movie with big name stars and no script simply doesn't work.
This isn't to say that the no name actors in "Frequency" don't do a good
job. James Caviezel ("The Thin Red Line") does a very good job of showing a
wide range of emotions without going over the top. Dennis Quaid
("Dragonheart") gives his usual fine, understated performance, and Andre
Braugher ("Primal Fear") turns in a great performance as Frank Sullivan's
cop friend, Satch. Of course, the actors are assisted by some good, if at
times a bit too sappy, dialogue. Great lines like "I wanted to let you know
you went down thirty years ago, you just don't know it yet" are sprinkled
throughout the movie.
In addition to the nice performances and dialogue, "Frequency" has a few
other things going for it. Gregory Hoblit's direction is quite impressive,
He keeps things interesting by moving events along at a steady pace and only
allowing sequences to drag on a little too long once or twice. The
soundtrack nicely compliments the story, It always plays softly in the
background, rather than overwhelming what is being said (Which is a common
practice these days). "Frequency" is one of those good natured movies which
are now so ill received. While there may be violence, that isn't what this
film is about. It's about a man able to reach back in time and talk to
someone who he never had the chance to say goodbye to. "Frequency" is a good
movie which will unforunately do poorly at the box office due to lack of
star power, advertising, and the ever popular extreme violence. The film
runs 117 minutes, which might have been cut down to 105 with a bit more
editing. I'd recommend it to fans of time travel stories and give it four
out of five stars.

         At one time or another everyone has entertained the idea of
being able to go back and change the past. Usually, these thoughts are
sparked by some kind of regret: "If only I hadn't ordered another
pitcher. . ."; "If only I'd saved my money for tuition instead of buying
that New Kids on the Block box set. . ."; "If only I hadn't moved to
Portage. . ."
 For John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), the gaping hole in his life
is the absence of his father Frank (Dennis Quaid), a firefighter who
died while battling a blaze 30 years ago. Through a truly cosmic twist
of fate, John gets the opportunity to remedy that, only to learn that
once you start playing with the past, you invariably alter the present
as well.
 That's the premise of "Frequency," a combination
fantasy/tearjerker/thriller with several dizzying twists. It's the first
screenplay of former film industry executive Noah Emmerich, and it all
but overflows with imagination, suspense and big ideas. Ultimately,
Emmerich gets so caught up in his own yarn he writes himself into a
corner, although the flawed finale by no means dampens the rest of the
movie.
 In the same way "The Sixth Sense" managed to be something more
than a spooky horror film, "Frequency" sets itself apart from most
science-fiction by focusing on its human components instead of throwing
a lot of hardware in our faces. If there's no real familial resemblence
between the soft-spoken, dewy-eyed Caviezel (the sensitive,
contemplative soldier in "The Thin Red Line") and the congenial,
devil-may-care Quaid, it's still easy to buy them as father and son
because the actors establish such a wonderful rapport with each other.
Even more impressively, they do this without actually being able to
appear onscreen together: All Caviezel's scenes take place in 1999,
while Quaid's character is still in 1969. They communicate via an old
ham radio set John inherited from Frank.
 As he demonstrated with Edward Norton and Richard Gere in
"Primal Fear," director Gregory Hoblit is not afraid to stand back and
give his performers some room when it's required. Quaid and Caviezel
reward him -- and us -- with thoughtful performances. As realities shift
and relationships change because of John's interference, Hoblit artfully
uses double exposures and slightly blurred images to reflect the
timeline being knocked out of whack.
 The only really objectionable detour in "Frequency" is
Emmerich's inclusion of a plot strand involving a serial killer who
eventually figures prominently in the lives of both heroes. While some
of this is handled innovatively, it eventually overcomplicates an
already tricky storyline and Emmerich is forced to reach into the
reliable old cliche bag to come up with an ending for it. Hoblit adds
insult to injury by slapping a blaring Garth Brooks power-ballad over
top of the final scenes; it's shameless, but it sure isn't "Shameless."
 Those missteps aside, "Frequency" is mostly fun and often
touching. It's surprisingly thought-provoking, too, since it's all but
impossible to leave the theater without asking yourself, "What if I
could reach back in time and save (insert relative or friend of your
choice)?" Maybe he or she could have prevented you from buying that New
Kids collection. James Sanford

FREQUENCY (2000) by JOHN SYLVA, associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)
It's a wonder of a concept, isn't it?  The thought of reaching back in time,
changing a certain something that in turn alters the course of your life
forever- Is it really possible?  Screenwriter of the new film "Frequency," Toby
Emmerich, would try to pass the idea off, but perhaps the concept would be a
good one for him, which would allow the first time scribe to reach back in time
and fix all of the plot holes and mistakes his script bares.  "Frequency" has
its ups and downs, but when it's all over, there's nothing that the film holds
effective or memorable enough to have any lasting effect on the viewer.
John Sullivan is a modern man with a modern life, living in the year 1999.  He
is a dedicated police officer, with a great deal amount of affection for his
single mother, as his father Frank died in 1969.  Everything about John's life
is modern.   Frank Sullivan is a man in the past, living in the year 1969.  He
is a dedicated firefighter, with a great deal amount of affection for his son,
John, and his wife.  Everything in Frank's life is just an element of the past.
 How could it be, that parallel universes on Earth are in existence
simultaneously?   
"Frequency" tells the complicated story of the son, John Sullivan (James
Caviezel), who will communicate with his father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid),
over his dad's old ham radio- Who's been dead for thirty years.  The two unite
(reunite for John) over the radio like friends would at school after their
summer vacation, very un-father/son like, and then play catch up, as Frank has
no knowledge that his future has death in store, and John is still shocked that
there's a Ã¢ÂÂlil John living thirty years before him.  After the two are pretty
much on the same page, "Frequency" becomes more of a thriller, as Frank has now
overcome what would have been his death, resulting in everything in the future
being different- Including the fact that John's mom lost her life long ago to a
serial killer.
Quaid and Caviezel are major letdowns in their starring roles, as neither one
ever convinces the viewer that they're witnessing an occurrence of the
supernatural.  They rehearse the already dull dialogue without caring, and
handle scenes of intense drama with mellow mediocrity.  
The screenplay isn't written convincingly or focused enough for the idea of the
parallel worlds existing to be believable, which is a major chip on this film's
shoulder, as in order for us to believe "Frequency," we must suspend our
beliefs about the laws of physics, the element of space and time, and the
ability and capacity of the human memory.  Emmerich's script is full of too
many holes to pass anything off in the film as realistic.  Time is certainly on
the character's sides in the film, and it would have been to Emmerich as well
if he had polished his work before having it produced into this mess of a
feature film.  
Gregory Hoblit's follow up to the eerily intense "Fallen" is mostly a letdown,
as "Frequency" doesn't seem to build strong enough roots before delving into
the numerous subplots that it has.  The film seems to be trying to make a film
as magical as quite possibly the best fantasy film ever made, "Field of
Dreams," but never even thinks about making a film that plants its own roots.
"Frequency" is a perfect example of when too much is too little, as constant
twist after turn is taken, which is usually something I look for in a film, but
the catch is: The screenplay isn't written well enough for us to really care.
Although "Frequency" is a film of numerous problems, it certainly has its
undeniably touching and exciting moments, but the sloppy screenplay and acting
make for a film that is nothing extraordinary. For a good portion of the film,
you're feeling positive about the general environment and story, but as the
film progresses, the intriguing setup transforms into an aimless, shallow film
possessing a "Sixth Sense"-ish ending that may encourage one to stand up and
cheer for a moment, but then after the credits roll, you're left with the
burning question, "That's it?"  Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for
sentimental, crowd pleaser endings- Just not when a film is as unsatisfying,
incomplete, and average as "Frequency" is.
The Bottom Line: "Frequency" is a film of mystery, suspicion, murder, love,
reunion, and family...Somewhere, among it all, the effect vanishes into thin
air.

A cross between "Quantum Leap" and "Field of Dreams" this sci-fi drama tells 
the story of a grown up son
who is able to talk to his dead father with his old hamm radio 30 years in 
the past. The son (James
Caviezial) saves the father (Dennis Quaid) from dying by telling him the 
future, but somehow they change
history and the mother dies at the hands of a serial killer. 
There's a lot of time travel paradoxes that twist the story in knots but it 
doesn't matter much because at the
center of it all is a lot of heart and pure goodness. It's quite amazing the 
film is able to string together a
story about tracking down the same killer both in the past and the future. 
Maybe it's a little too Hollywood
at times but nevertheless it's enjoyable.

Running Time: 117 minutes 
When you go to the movies as much as I do, you unfortunately end up
seeing certain movie trailers one too many times.  Such was the case
with Frequency.  Every time I went to a screening, there was the
Frequency preview.  It looked awful.  It looked cheesy, sappy and
ridiculous.  It looked like a flop.  Well, whoever put that trailer
together should be fired, because in terms of pure entertainment,
Frequency is one of the best of the year thus far. 
Frequency boasts a compelling story line.  An occurrence of freakish
solar activity allows police detective John Sullivan (James Caviezel) to
speak to his fireman father Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) through a ham
radio, despite the fact that Frank has been dead for 30 years.  John is
able to give his father information that prevents his death in a
warehouse fire, but by doing so causes other changes.  Somehow, a serial
killer's reign of terror, which in the original timeline had been
stopped at three murders, extends to ten victims... including John's
mother. 
This is director Gregory Hoblit's third film (the other two being Primal
Fear and Fallen).  With all three, he's managed to attach himself to
great scripts (this one by Toby Emmerich, whose only previous movie
experience was as a music supervisor on numerous New Line films) and add
equally great direction.  Also, he apparently likes to have his films
wrap up with a kick-ass ending. Frequency is no exception, the ending is
unpredictable and incredibly satisfying.  Hoblit is three for three, and
I hope he can keep it up. 
Now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the
sci-fi elements of Frequency.  But the fact of the matter is that time
travel has never been achieved.  Who's to say how something works and
how it doesn't when it's never happened?  Is it because we've become
accustomed to time travel "laws" from other places like "Star Trek" and
the Back to the Future trilogy and "Quantum Leap"?  Yes, if you sit down
and think about it, certain plot elements in this film probably won't
make any sense.  Most films are like that.  Don't let that dissuade you
from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however. 
When Frequency was over, it made me wish I had seen it with my father so
I could have given him a hug (okay okay, shut up).  When you break it
down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics, Frequency is
simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share. 
It's touching, it's sincere, and it's what ultimately makes this movie
work.  [PG-13]

     One of the best science fiction films of the 1970s was Nicholas
Meyer's TIME AFTER TIME.  The rather fantastic and dubious premise
of this film was that H.  G. Wells was not only an unknowing friend
of Jack the Ripper, he also had built a real, functioning time
machine.  The Ripper escapes the police by taking the time machine
to 1979 and Wells has to follow and try to capture the Ripper.  One
would think that a time machine and the ability to retrieve
knowledge from the future might be useful in capturing a serial
killer, but Wells finds that it is a mixed blessing.  These same
ideas are revisited in FREQUENCY, albeit without a time machine.
     The film begins October 10, 1999, at a time of solar flares and
sunspot activity.  (The real height of solar activity was April 7,
2000, just three weeks before the national release of FREQUENCY.
Ironically that would have not been good for the script, however,
which was contrived to take place during a World Series.)
Commentators talking about the solar activity point out that string
theory says that time is fluid.  (What that has to do with sunspots
and solar flares in the commentators' minds is not clear.  But it
does set the stage for the story.)
     John Sullivan's life has been overshadowed by the loss of his
beloved father when John was only six years old.  Frank Sullivan
(played by Dennis Quaid) was a heroic firefighter, a great baseball
fan, and above all a very loving father.  Two nights before the 30th
anniversary of his father's death, John (James Caviezel), now a
detective, pulls out his father's ham radio and starts a
conversation with another ham.  What he does not realize at first is
that a freak solar phenomenon has provided him a radio channel
across almost no distance, but across thirty years.  He is speaking
to his father sitting at the same desk exactly thirty years earlier.
The two discuss the 1969 World Series, not realizing that it was for
one an imminent occurrence, for the other a fond but distant memory.
When John realizes what is happening and what he can now do, he
gives his skeptical father the information that he will need to
avoid being killed.  But John will quickly figure out what science
fiction fans have known all along, that tampering with the past is
risky business.  In a nifty Rube Goldbergism of time, saving Frank's
life has allowed a serial killer to avoid a termination of his
criminal career.  And for reasons less coincidental than they first
appear this particular serial killer is going to strike very near
home.  John has to try to manipulate the past through his father and
then see how the world has changed in thirty years as a result of
those changes.
     The time warp that allows a series of conversations between
father and son is acceptable as a reasonable premise for a science
fiction film.  For dramatic effect they have added that one is aware
of the change if and only if one was involved in bringing it about.
This is total bunkum.  The physical universe does not care whose
idea a change in the past was.  Either everybody would remember the
change or--much more likely--nobody would.  But the first would
completely change the plot and the second would rob the film of
drama because John could not know of his own victories in changing
the past.  Towards the end even this rule breaks down and in the
final scene John seems to remember the past he has changed out of,
but not the new past he has brought about.  Everyone else in the
world remembers only the new past.  The ideas need a little
reconsidering.  And then once the ideas are straightened out, put
them in a movie with a more original plot than stopping a serial
killer.  To compound the credibility problem John is put onto a case
with which he would be expected to be emotionally closely involved.
It is an invitation to conflicts of interest and abuse of power.  It
is highly unlikely the police would allow that.
     There is more than a little social comment in the interfacing
of 1969 and 1999.  In 1969 the elder Sullivan had a storybook,
rose-covered-cottage sort of existence.  He has the most totally
functional family we have seen on the screen for a long time.  Two
parents and a child love the heck out of each other.  The family
gives the father strength to go out and risk his life for others
with the complete support of his loved ones.  Thirty years later
John is separated from a woman to whom he never committed.  He still
lives in his parents' house.  His life seems a mess.  Of course,
losing a father may have contributed to that, but it seems he should
be emotionally further advanced.
     One final complaint.  I am less than thrilled to see the
photography of scenes set in my sophomore year in college tinted a
sepia tone as if to indicate great antiquity.  1969 was just not
that long ago. FREQUENCY is better than most science fiction we see
these days.  It has ideas and good pacing.  I give FREQUENCY a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

If you've seen any of the `Back to the Future' or
`Star Trek' adventures, cutting through the fabric of
time is about as easy as walking through the front
door.  All you have to do is speed up that DeLorean
sports car or fly through some spatial anomaly.  In
`Frequency,' you would need a ham radio and a flurry
of solar activity.  The difficult thing, however, is
not to disturb anything once you've gone back to the
past.  Innocently stepping on a flower can alter the
future in unforeseeable ways.  Thus, time travel is
one of the most creative yet trickiest of plot
devices.  Do it wrong and the result is a flimsy story
filled with incongruities.  Do it right and the result
might be `Frequency,' an inventive story about a Dad,
his son, and second chances.
The film opens in the year 1969.  The Dad (Dennis
Quaid) is the spirited, responsible, and fun-loving
kind that all kids want.  He's also a heroic
firefighter.  But his risk-taking approach eventually
gets the better of him.  Thirty years later, his son
(Jim Caviezel) has grown up to become a respected
homicide detective.  Like all children who lost their
fathers at an early age, he wishes that he had the
chance to get to know him better. 
It's just about the anniversary of his Dad's death. 
He pulls out his father's old ham radio, which has
been stored away for many years.  Incredibly, the
antiquated device still works.  John is further
astonished when he hears a voice from the other end. 
The voice says words like `Little Chief' (John's
nickname) and relates other information that
incredulously makes it seem as if the mysterious voice
is living in the past.  
After much contemplation, John can only conclude that
the other voice is his Dad's, talking from the year
1969.  It is a heartwarming sequence as these two
connect, and we believe the love that they share.  `We
must be talking off the mother of all sunspots,' his
Dad says in amazement.  John can neither contain his
excitement.  And without thinking about the
consequences of his conversation, he tells his Dad to
be careful, for tomorrow marks the day that he will
die in a fire.
You can't blame John for his actions.  But his advice
initiates a chain reaction that alters future events. 
In the new future, a serial murder case has now
escalated to new heights.  John has to try to repair
the damage that has been done.  The two work together
in a frenetic attempt to catch the killer.  Here's one
great benefit of time travel as a crime tool.  In
1969, when the killer leaves his fingerprint on an
object, wrap it up and hide it within the walls of the
house.  Then in 1999, John can retrieve it and use
modern technology to find out who the killer is.
As with all time travel plots, you can always find
fault with how the story resolves itself.  In this
case, there is a double showdown, one that occurs
concurrently in the present and in the past.  But
enjoying what transpires depends on whether you become
fed up with the idea of solar flares enabling time
displacement (smartly, the two characters are as
dumbfounded as the audience) or whether you are hooked
on the idea of a son getting a second chance to know
his Dad and to set things right.  Concentrate on the
latter, and you can't go wrong.
The film is impressive because the emotional aspect of
the story is so appealing.  Its mood is uncanny but
not haunting.  Its payoff is uplifting but not
treacley.  It doesn't benefit from special effects or
any big name stars. `Frequency,' however, is an evenly
paced and well-constructed story that enthralls and
keeps you guessing as to which way the film will turn.
 This is one of more enjoyable films of this season.

http://www.moviereviews.org/frequency.htm ---
Frequency, the first film penned by Toby Emmerich (Noah's brother), is so
beautifully crafted and stunningly patriotic that it moves through its
almost two hours without a moment of boredom. This, despite an
oftentimes-painful lack of intellectual breadth and plot holes that only
serve to detract from a film that could have easily been on par with
classics like Field of Dreams.
The movie requires audiences to suspend belief and accept a rather
far-fetched plot that is actually refreshingly innocent and magical, not
unlike Cinderella's midnight curfew: because of a special alignment in the
evening sky, one that hasn't been seen so brightly for 30 years, John
Sullivan (a mediocre Jim Caviezel) is able to speak with his father, Frank
(an excellent Dennis Quaid), Â who has been dead for those 30 years.
As the duo chat away under the stars every evening, they begin to change the
history of the three decades that separate them - this is interesting.
Unfortunately, as the two try to change some untoward events (namely Frank's
untimely death and his wife's murder), it seems that no one is effected
other than the characters immediately pertaining to the story. Essentially,
the movie tries to isolate chaos theory according to what is convenient to
explain and disregard what would be too much of a hassle to further develop.
Interestingly, the film makes you ponder what it would be like to be in
Frank's shoes. Similar to one of the punishments a death row inmate faces,
Frank now knows how and approximately when he will die and, additionally, is
deprived of the privilege of seeing his son grow up and wondering what he
will do with his life. Unfortunately, Frequency does little to address these
questions and leaves them to the audience as more of an afterthought than
significant query. It would be well worth the extra time, even if the film
surpassed two and a half hours, for these questions to be dealt with on
screen rather than have the two main characters so easily accept the
nighttime magic and all of its side effects.
All the main characters in Frequency are either police officers, firemen or
nurses. With the exception of the aforementioned serial killer, who brings
contrast to the production, everyone is the ultimate red-blooded American.
Baseball, the American pastime, is a favorite topic of conversation, a cold
beer the preferred drink and New York City the place to be. Similarly,
Frequency is the typical, feel-good American movie. Sure, there are a few
plot holes and some things could be slightly better thought out, but family
values have rarely seen a heavier emphasis then they get here and that is
just about as American as one can get.

What if you had an opportunity to talk to your dead father as he was 30
years ago?  What would you say?
This opportunity of a lifetime may never be yours, but it is John
Sullivan's (James Caviezel) in FREQUENCY.  He happens to tap into his
dad's frequency on a ham radio across a massive sun spot.  Shocked and
disbelieving at first, they eventually realize that they are talking to
each other across 30 years.
This event fortuitously occurs just two days before his dad, Frank
(Dennis Quaid), died, so John tries to make the most of it.  But,
following the law of unintended consequences, the actions that John and
Frank take end up altering history in ways both good and bad.  Worse
than messing with Mother Nature is fooling around with the time-space
continuum, even if it is for such a laudable purpose as trying to save
your father's life.
In a lesser director's hands, this movie could easily have dissolved
into schmaltz or a cheap sci-fi flick.  Director Gregory Hoblit (FALLEN
and PRIMAL FEAR), aided again by David Rosenbloom's perfectly timed
editing, delivers a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and
a heart-warming father-son story that comes along as a wonderful bonus.
The effects of modifying the past are ingeniously explored by the
wonderfully complex and satisfying script of first-time writer Toby
Emmerich.  Toby's brother, actor Noah Emmerich (Truman's best friend in
THE TRUMAN SHOW), plays John's best buddy, Gordo.  The tightly-written
script contains twist upon twist, and its potential holes appear to be
thoroughly plugged.  The intense film works more for the writing and the
directing than the acting, although the actors are more than adequate.
Among the examples of the script's ingenuity is the way that the shared
desk is used to communicate across time.  Since both father and son have
the same ham radio on the same desk, burns and cuts on the desk are used
to advance key sections of the storyline.  In one incident, the dad
carves a message to the son, who sees it in the future.
This is, however, the type of film that may disappoint some viewers.
When the father honestly expresses love for his son, and his son says
how much he misses him, a large section of our audience broke into
catcalls.  They liked the action-thriller parts -- including some
impressive fires and explosions -- but somehow couldn't deal with
sincere expressions of love between a father and a son.  Personally, I
was close to tears.
FREQUENCY can legitimately be called a good-spirited thriller, a
category that barely exists.  It is also sometimes funny with one of the
best parts concerning a stock recommendation.
The intriguing story holds your attention from start to finish.  With
characters worth caring about and a mesmerizing plot, the movie is
thoroughly entertaining and intelligent to boot.  And like many a movie,
it isn't the saccharinely silly story that the movie's trailers might
lead you to believe.  This is an intense and fast-paced film that
sometimes literally takes your breath away.
FREQUENCY runs 1:56.  It is rated PG-13 for intense violence and
disturbing images and would not be appropriate for those under 13.

 Frequency (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Dennis Quaid, Jim
Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Noah Emmerich and Elizabeth Mitchell. Written
by Toby Emmerich. Directed by Gregory Hoblit.
 "Frequency" is an implausible, but entertaining fantasy that taps into
one of man's primal fantasies: the what-if scenario.
 "Frequency" is a thriller in which a father and son, separated by time,
work together to stop a serial killer.
 Detective John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) who, after breaking up with his
girlfriend (or wife, we are never sure which she is) hooks up his dad's
old ham radio gear and - with the help of `the mother of all sun spots'
- he is conversing with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a heroic
firefighter killed 30 years earlier in the line of duty.
 Am I giving anything away by spilling the beans here? Not really.
 For as Frequency progresses, history changes as often as diapers on
newborn quintuplets.
 History is first altered when John warns his father about his impending
death. 
 Frank, acting on John's advice, escapes the fatal Bruxton warehouse
fire.
 But then traces of John's mother disappear, and it appears she has
become a victim of a serial killer who was never captured. Somehow
Frank's survival has changed history.
 Of course, no one in either era believes John or Frank as they go about
mucking up the space-time continuum.
 The problem with movies such as "Frequency" is that they ignore the
larger context of how one small change, like a ripple in a stream,
affects the entire timeline. To cover all that, of course, a movie would
have to run four or five hours, while a novel would probably run close
to 1,000 pages.
 So, wisely, most filmmakers and authors ignore this potential snare.
 Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, who directed
"Primal Fear," "Frequency" has an innocent charm about it, despite its
sometime gruesome subject matter.
 Much of what happens is predictable. The suspense is not so much
who-done-it, but how will everything be resolved.
 Quaid gives a solid performance as the hot-shot firefighter who is
devoted to his wife and young son. A die-hard Mets fan, he uses
knowledge told him by Frank about the Amazin' Mets and their 1969 World
Series heroics to convince others of his sanity.
 Caviezel, who was featured in "The Thin Red Line," is almost childlike
as he makes contact with his role model-hero. He is good looking and
macho, yet vulnerable and a bit dazed by the events that begin to
dominate his life.
 Also in the cast is the fabulous Andre Braugher as Frank's best friend
and John's police mentor; Noah Emmerich as Gordo, John's lifelong best
friend; and Elizabeth Mitchell as John's loving mother.
 "Frequency" is not prime filmmaking, but it does grip you despite some
of its shortcomings. It's a middle-fare meal of a movie, one that will
not overwhelm you, but will leave you satisfied.

Time-travel can be an exciting arena for the cinema because it defies all logic
and pretense. After all, it does not seem feasible that we can travel backwards
in time, but the very notion does bring up all kinds of strange paradoxes, as
does traveling forward into the future. But then you have a film like
"Frequency" which asks not so much to defy logic but to defy reason. 
Consider the premise of the film. You have a sullen cop named John Sullivan (Jim
Caveziel) who removes an old ham radio from his closet. He plays with it and
discovers one night that he can communicate with his father (Dennis Quaid). Here
is the catch: John's father, a dedicated firefighter, died in a horrific blazing
fire while in the line of duty. So it is John in 1999 having conversations with
his dad who is alive and well in 1969! How can this be? Can it be the strange
forms of lights in the night sky that are causing a break in the space-time
continuum? Or, to be more radical, could it be that it is all in John's mind?
Nevertheless, we are left with suspending logic temporarily since John realizes
his father will die in that fire within a few days in 1969, just before the Mets
play their first game in the World Series! Can John prevent his father from
dying in the past? And wouldn't that rupture the space-time continuum? 
I am willing to suspend disbelief at the cinemas as much as everyone else, but
there is something horribly wrong from the get-go. Though the story is not
possible by any stretch of the imagination, in terms of just pure scientific
reasoning, how could John be talking to his father from the past? Would that not
be changing the future at all just based solely on that premise alone? And how
can John only feel that the future has changed until his father changes the past
at the approximate time that coincides with the time in the future? Why should
that matter? And if everything can be erased as it is with (*SPOILER*) John's
father surviving the fire, then how can John feel an alternate time line
existing when no one else can? Just a matter of logic and reasoning based on the
filmmaker's rules. Stephen Hawking would have a field day with all this. 
All paradoxes aside, the basic problem with "Frequency" is that I never believed
the relationship between John and his father. Simply put, there is no chemistry
between Dennis Quaid and Jim Caveziel - they do not make a fitting father-son
combo. And frankly all the time paradoxes, and an implausible serial-killer plot
to boot, distract from the emotional connection to the story which is simply
about a father and son trying to communicate. Added to that is the lack of an
explanation about Jim's girlfriend, who leaves him at the beginning, and then
does not recognize him later after the past had been changed. A little nod to
"It's A Wonderful Life" to be sure, but the subplot is left dangling like an
unexposed wire in a time machine, and thus she is never seen or heard from
again.
If nothing else, it is a pleasure seeing Dennis Quaid back to his clever, sly,
cocky self - sort of a grown-up version of his character in "Dreamscape." He is
often like a live wire, ready to explode at any moment (the opening sequence
where he survives a fire is followed by Martha Reeves' "Heatwave.") "Frequency"
is too just too low on the voltage meter to follow Quaid's live-wire act.

Dennis Quaid with a decent role in a good movie? Say it ain't so. But it is
so for Mr. Meg Ryan, a man who is still trying to live down his horribly
over-the-top impression of Jerry Lee Lewis in GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, and whose
film choices (UNDERCOVER BLUES, GANG RELATED, SWITCHBACK, etc...) haven't
exactly been prime career moves. Well, it looks like he's finally got the
right frequency... ;)
PLOT:
Now pay very close attention. A thirty-something year old man living in
1999, is able to contact his own father in 1966 via a ham radio and some
freaky astrological event which allows for this unbelievable circumstance to
take place. But that's only half the story. As the two men come to terms
with this reality and get to know one another better, they quickly realize
that anything they say or alter due to their conversations, will ultimately
change the future and their own fates therein.
CRITIQUE:
Pretty gosh darn original! This film delivers on all fronts: solid acting, a
well-told and surprisingly believable story despite its fantastic premise,
some cool special effects, an emotional tug and plenty of thrills. Hollywood
should be proud of this release, a film which actually expects audiences to
use their brains and invest much of their attention, in order to fully
appreciate the film's intriguing story line. This movie makes you think,
think some more, and ultimately entertains while engaging the viewer with
non-stop brain-candy. Dennis Quaid succeeds in his part despite the goofy
accent, Jim Caviezel is rock-solid and definitely slated for bigger and
better things, and even the secondary characters, such as Andre Braugher and
Elizabeth Mitchell, deliver appropriately believable performances. Will some
people get confused with this movie? Sure. This film does flip-flop somewhat
between the different time lines, but unlike BACK TO THE FUTURE 2, which
also had a vaguely similar theme, this one presents you with all the needed
clues and explanations in order for you to keep up to date...that is, if
you're paying attention.
Having said that, the film actually begins on quite the slow note, with many
of the characters and situations gradually being presented to us with a
basic amount of "suspension of disbelief" needed to enjoy the rest of the
film. But once the initial premise is solidified and made to be very
credible, the movie turns into a very funky mystery murder thriller. Events
from the past alter those in the future, father and son work together to
solve a crime, despite living in different periods of time, and the movie
ultimately takes off in the second half, when all the ideal elements of a
thriller are successfully played out. The film's final 15 minutes are
probably its finest, with plenty of tension, creative license and surprising
turns to certify this film an original. Of course, if you're looking for
your everyday run-of-the-mill thriller, than you might just be disappointed
with this film's prerequisite for intellectual participation. But for anyone
else who likes thinking at the movies, enjoys watching good actors handle
great material, and has been looking forward to seeing an original film
break out of the early 2000 pack, wait no further cause this movie is the
one for you!
One of the things that I liked the most about this film was how its aura
seemed to remind me a lot of THE SIXTH SENSE. Despite not having much in
common thematically, it's obvious that both filmmakers expect their
audiences to pay attention during their presentations, and furnish them with
a sorted premise ripe enough for repeat viewings. Of course, some might want
to dig real deep in order to decipher the holes in plot, as did certain
detractors of the former film, but from my own experience, the film had me
...hook, line and sinker. No need to nit-pit here, folks...this film is a
fun, intelligent thriller with a heart. Enjoy.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Noah Emmerich, one of the co-stars in this movie, is the brother of Toby
Emmerich, the screenwriter of this movie.

The science fiction thriller _Frequency_ asks a number of questions, a
few of which are showcased in its trailer.  "What if you could reach back
in time?"  "What if you could change the past?"  "What if it changed
everything?"  The most important question, however, is left uncovered:
"What if you had an interesting premise and then went about it all
wrong?"  The answer to that query is the disappointing film itself.
The root of that problem is clearly evidenced in the trailer.  Buzz
around Gregory Hoblit's film had been building steadily the past few
months, and at first the preview proves why.  The idea behind Toby
Emmerich's screenplay is intriguing.  In 1999, cop John Sullivan (Jim
Caviezel) discovers the old ham radio that belonged to his fireman father
Frank (Dennis Quaid), who died in action nearly 30 years to the day. 
Somehow, some way the 1999 radio is able to pick up signals from 1969,
namely those of Frank.  John, who never had a chance to really know his
father, suddenly finds himself bonding with him through time and space by
way of the radio.  But the seemingly innocent talk proves to have
far-reaching consequences, altering the past and future in ways that are
not always for the better.
So far, so good, but then the trailer ends on a completely wrong note:
Frank and a weeping Jim saying "I love you" to each other.  It's a
jarringly maudlin note to end an ad for what had been sold as a thriller,
and it's to Hoblit and Emmerich's credit that in the film, the father-son
emotional angle is more smoothly embedded into the story.  Even so, such
sentimentality is far from the director's strong suit.  Hoblit's previous
feature credits are _Primal_Fear_ and _Fallen_, two films that are
characterized by--and whose success was largely due to--their darkness
and cynicism.  Those aren't exactly the best qualifications to tackle
something with as severe a case of the warm fuzzies as _Frequency_, and
as is typically the case with underqualified directors attempting
something "deep" and "emotional," sentimentality becomes schmaltz.
There is one big problem hidden by _Frequency_'s trailer, and that is
the wrongheaded shift that occurs about midway.  Up until that point, the
interesting premise has its appeal and wonder, but it suddenly morphs
into a typical serial killer thriller, with John attempting to nab a
murderer of nurses.  The special wrinkle is that the killings take place
in 1969, and Frank has to do the legwork under the advisement John gives
in 1999.  That proves to be just a minor detail, though, for we get the
familiar scenes of Frank skulking around bars, following suspicious
characters and having suspicious characters follow him.  Even more
familiar is the fact that the killer's reach extends to Frank and John's
family.
There's still that great hook, though, but in retrospect there is
another miscalculation at work.  With premises that delve into the
fantastic, one should either offer a thorough explanation or none at all;
you either try to make logical sense, or just make the audience accept it
as a given.  Emmerich and Hoblit wrongly attempt at a middle ground.  It
is implied that Frank and John are able to communicate through time
because radio transmissions are trapped over time in the Aurora Borealis,
but there's nothing beyond a vague reference or two.  Such a
half-hearted, unclear reasoning is sure to leave no one satisfied.
The two leads, however, do not disappoint.  Quaid hasn't had a major
league role in years, and he proves here that, when given the chance, he
can deliver.  Frank is a good, upstanding guy, and Quaid makes the
character a lot more interesting than that basic description would make
him out to be.  Caviezel first caught my--and many other's--eye with his
standout work as the de facto lead in _The_Thin_Red_Line_, and the
reasons why I like him so much may very well be the reasons why he may
never become a big star; he's an introspective, subtle performer who
doesn't resort to broad theatrics.  His internal approach works well for
John, who must hide his inner pain and inadequacy under the tough faÃ§ade
of a police detective.
They--and the rest of the strong cast--deserve better than _Frequency_. 
Then again, the idea behind _Frequency_ deserves better than _Frequency_,
which proves that having an inspired idea is only half the battle in
making a good movie.

   Remember this? "Why'd she have to go/I don't know/She
wouldn't say/I said something wrong/Now I long for
yesterday."  Don't we all?  Time marches inexorably on. As
we get older, the days seem to spin by at an ever-increasing
clip.  How we long to go back to the past and change the
ways we messed up.  We could have studied harder, pursued
that special person more ardently, had a different career,
expressed the love for our parents that we never had time to
do.  Some cynics say that if we could go back in time, we'd
wind up doing the same things, making the same mistakes,
and ending up pretty much as we do now--although an
outstanding new sci-fi movie tells us that we could have had
a lot more money if we only knew one word..."Yahoo."  
   This new movie is Gregory Hoblit's "Frequency," one with a
more modest premise.  Here, a 36-year-old man does not
actually go back to the past to test these theories, but he is
able to communicate with the most important person in his
life, his dad.  By knowing the way his father died, he is able
to save his father's life, not once but twice.  But in doing this
he pays a price.  Because the older man survives,
unforeseen disasters occur, jeopardizing the lives of several
women including the young man's mom.  By manipulating a
series of intricate, keen, and credible twists and turns,
director Hoblit utilizes a crackerjack script by Tony Emmerich
and some conscientious performances to fashion a film that
is rich in surprises, tension, and cinematic wonder.  With
fireballs, explosions, a brilliant solar storm and a pulsating
soundtrack, "Frequency" is "Armageddon" with a brain. 
"Frequency" is a multi-layered film wonderfully combining the
themes of father-son relations, working-class culture, and a
spooky murder motif.  The razzle-dazzle camerawork doesn't
simply show the radio conversations between dad in 1969
and son in 1999 with the expected split-screen effect but
shoots the two characters as would a multi-camera TV show--
which significantly ups the already frenetic pace.
   Instead of delving into character development the usual
way, Hoblit shows us pretty much all we need to know about
fire fighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) straight away. He is
a hero who plunges into a New York sewer to rescue a man
trapped inside.  As gasoline spills about the ground, with
electrical wiring about to convert an entire city block to a
blazing inferno, Frank ignores orders to clear out.  He
completes the rescue.  Frank is a idol not only in the eyes of
the NYPD: his home life is a dream with a loving wife, Julia
(Elizabeth Mitchell) and a cute six-year-old, Johnny (Daniel
Henson).  The dream becomes a nightmare when Frank is
killed in a warehouse fire.  Thirty years after his death, his
son John (Jim Caviezel) discovers an old ham radio just after
a solar storm has lit up the sky and, plugging it in, he finds
that he can communicate with the world of 1969 and talk to
his father one day before Frank's tragic death.  John saves
the man's life, altering destiny.
   At this point, the usual sci-fi movie might come to a happy
conclusion, father and son perhaps finding a way to meet
across time.  In this particularly resourceful story, however,
dad's deliverance leads to a chain reaction of disasters, as a
serial killer changes his plans to go specifically after John's
mom, dad, and even John himself.
   Our emotions are orchestrated in many ways throughout
this movie's bold feats of imagination.  As we eavesdrop on
the conversations between John and Frank, we root for them
to communicate with each other in a way that would not
previously have been possible given that John was only six
years old when his father perished.  At the same time, we get
an insight into people who are the real heroes of our time--
not the yuppies of Bret Easton Ellis's "American Psycho" who
make a fortune shuffling papers nor, I fear, the educators
who bore their students in schools and colleges.  The
superstars are the people who make our lives safe from
crime and natural disaster--specifically the fire fighters and
the police.  (Strange, isn't it, that when we were kids and
asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we'd
inevitably say "cop" or "fireman"?  Do you know a six year old
who would opt to be a stockbroker?)  Finally, Hoblit layers in
the crime strain.  A serial killer is on the loose, getting away
with the murders of ten nurses, living out his life in obscurity
in a New York outer borough.  Through the advantages of an
old fashioned radio--and not via the flair of modern tools of
forensic science or even a computer--a gray-haired assassin
is warned that justice will be served: not in 1999 when the
villain has already lived his life, but in 1969!  Side roles serve
the plot well, particularly that of Satch, a police detective
(Andre Braugher), a long-term friend of Frank who believes
that his pal is guilty of murder.  Hoblit has also captured
some good file footage of the 1969 World Series, showing his
viewers what the Amazin' Mets were capable of doing back
then.
   Several factors add to the movie's credibility in addition to
the choice performances of Caviezel and Quaid--who do not
look like father and son but whose chemistry together belies
that appearance.  Photographer Alar Kivilo films pretty much
on location--in Bayside, Queens and in Brooklyn
neighborhoods including Red Hook; while costume designer
Elisabetta Beraldo has kept busy displaying contrasts
between 1969 outfits and those of the present, including the
distinct uniforms donned by fire fighters during the Nixon
administration.  Toby Emmerich is the big surprise.  The head
of New Line Cinema's Music division for five years, Emmerich
has penned this blockbuster as his very first screenplay. (For
those who think that a good liberal education rather than
simply film school is unimportant, we emphasize that
Emmerich graduated from Wesleyan Phi Beta Kappa with
honors in English and a concentration in Classics and Film.)
   The production notes give the impression that not only is
Emmerich's screenplay and Hoblit's direction beautifully
meshed to make the action believable, but that time travel is
indeed possible even if such a journey is not within our
capabilities at present.  Given credibility, solid performances,
and dazzling effects, "Frequency" is this year's sci-fi film to
catch.

Have you ever had one of those moviegoing experiences where your eyes
were so fixated on the screen that your hand went down into the popcorn
.. . . and stayed there? That you called all of your friends afterwards
and told them "YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!" and when they asked "Why?," you
had to answer
This is not a question of not giving away the ending, like last year's
Sixth Sense. This is a story (screenplay by Toby Emmerich) that is so
well written, with details so intricately woven into the entire piece
that some idiot reviewer somewhere will feel compelled to lay out every
detail and wreck the experience for you.
Not me. You get the bare bones, like the skeleton found out behind an
abandoned diner in Queens, New York. Through flat out sheer luck, NYPD
Detective John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) gets a match on an old dental
record, showing that this girl was reported missing in 1968. The M.O. of
the killer makes her the first victim of the notorious Nightingale
Killer who terrorized the Big Apple and killed three nurses in 1969, the
year the Mets worked a miracle out at Shea Stadium.
In 1969, Firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) is loving husband to
wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) and only son, 6 year old Johnny (Daniel
Henson). At night, Frank likes to ride the airwaves of the world with
his Heathkit Ham Radio. There's a lot to talk about on the night of
October 10, for an aurora borealis has lit up the night sky with
brilliant colors that had never before been seen as far south as Bayside
Queens. That night, Frank reached parts of the world he had never talked
to. That night, he stumbled upon another Ham radio operator somewhere in
Queens, named John.
In 24 hours, Frank Sullivan will be killed in a fire . . . unless John
can convince him that, for reasons unknown, they are not talking across
distance. They are talking across time. If John can save his father's
life, his world will be inalterably changed. He doesn't realize that
until it happens and everything he's known for thirty years goes down
the tubes.
Which is all I'll tell you about the first, knockdown, get on line
immediately blockbuster to be movie of the year 2000. Except that Andre
Braugher plays an integral part as a detective whose career spans the
decades and whose path crosses both Sullivans many, many times.
And all the while Cranky sat in the screening room with a blank piece of
paper in front of him and the cap sitting on top of his pen. Not a note
was taken. Frequency is the kind of flick where you can't, no, you won't
take your eye off the screen. It's the kind of flick that falls into the
science fantasy genre and fits so perfectly with tales of time travel
(H.G. Wells started the genre a century ago) and parallel universes (and
no one messed with continuity more than DC Comics did in its Crisis on
Infinite Earths a decade or so ago)
We walked into Frequency without our SF heads screwed on, and ignoring
the press notes that explain all the intricacies and theories about the
space-time continuum and all that stuff. We did have out continuity caps
on, looking for script errors and discrepancies and the story moved back
and forth over the thirty year time period -- and didn't see any. And
while the little scriptwriter in the back of our brain was contemplating
a satisfying ending, by the time it hit, it hit like the proverbial
trainwreck. Frequency is an absolute smackdown. A flat out perfect,
mesmerizing thriller, from the director of Primal Fear (and the teevee
pilot of NYPD Blue, after a run exec producing Hill Street Blues and LA
Law).
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Frequency, he would have paid...
See it twice. Not because it's confusing or because it's so complicated
that you'll miss something. See it twice, 'cuz you'll want to. You will.

FREQUENCY [Hoblit] -- Too contrived, with every key event so obviously
foreshadowed, to be either lucid, or enjoyed in the silliest context.
Actually, no, that's not right: in fact, the film's final suspense
sequence is to be enjoyed only in the silliest context. That said, the
whole project works best a thriller guided by baseball in the vein
ofÂ Summer Of Sam (which I haven't seen, actually), and the modern day
sequences pale inÂ comparison to the older, despite Dennis Quaid's
stilted New York accent; mostÂ of it doesn'tÂ work (why does Hoblit have
to give aÂ reason --the Northern Lights -- for their being able to
communicate?), but when it does it's a nailbiter (the aforementioned
final sequence in particular, with anÂ odd, disjointed sense ofÂ fear and
unpredictably, albeit cut off by a laughable turnabout). Ironically,
though, it could've been a masterpiece if itÂ hadn't a hint ofÂ the murder
mystery, and an actor other than Jim Caviezel in the lead role (though,
even he began to grow onÂ me in the final reel).Â C+

>From its trailer, Frequency doesn't seem like much of a picture.  The
story is about a thirty-something cop that is somehow able to contact
his dead father through an old HAM radio.  The trailer portrays this
event with what seems like casual indifference Â like the guy just got
an AOL instant message from the kid that he sat next to in the seventh
grade.  The dialogue goes something like this:
Dad Â `Hey, Son.  It's me, your dead father.'
Dad Â `Yup.  Must be some big sun spot or something.'
Son (looking at his watch) Â `Yeah.  Hey, Dad?  This has been great, but
Millionaire is coming on right now, so I've gotta run.'
Dad Â `Alright.  Catch ya later, Son.  Oh, and remember to choke up on
that bat.'
Son Â `Whatever, dude.  I'm, like, all older now and stuff.'
The trailer then shows the father and son fighting crime and solving
murders from thirty years ago, but every time they do something, it
alters the future in ways that they can't anticipate.  Kind of like that
`Treehouse of Horror' episode of The Simpsons where Homer turns a
toaster into a time machine, repeatedly goes back in time and changes
his future.
But here's the thing Â even though Frequency is predictable, it's still
creepy as hell.  Why?  Look no further than director Gregory Hoblit, who
has quietly made two of the most unnerving films of the Â90s in Primal
Fear and Fallen.  It's hair-tingling and spine-raising and all of that
stuff.  Even the way Hoblit and cinematographer Alar Kivilo (A Simple
Plan) shoot normal interiors and exteriors is eerie.  But the whole
altering-the-future-by-changing-the-past plot has been done already, and
first-time scriptwriter Toby Emmerich offers little that we haven't
already seen before.
Frequency begins in 1969 Queens, where the borough is preparing for the
upcoming World Series between the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles.
Second-generation firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid, Any Given
Sunday) is happily married with a young son and a strong friendship with
a cop named Satch (AndrÃ© Braugher, Homicide: Life on the Streets).
Frank is also a HAM radio geek, but forbids his son from using the
contraption, instructing the boy - with a heavy New Yawk accent Â that
`Dis is not a toy.'
Flash to thirty years later, where Frank's son John (James Caviezel,
Ride With the Devil) is a homicide investigator (partnered with his
Satch) living in the home he grew up in.  He's still grieving the loss
of his father, who died during a fire in an abandoned seed warehouse
when John was just a boy.  On the eve of the anniversary of Frank's
demise, John happens to find a box of his dad's stuff, including his old
HAM radio.  John plugs it in, starts talking to his dead dad and warns
him about the warehouse fire, thus altering the future.
The fire scene is really well done.  It's one of those times where you
don't realize you're holding your breath until the scene is over and you
start gasping for air.  But then Frequency turns into a murder mystery,
where Frank and John work together to catch a serial killer that was
able to off more victims because of the way they messed with history.
Discovering the identity of the killer isn't as much of a priority as
stopping him because Mrs. Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell, Molly) became
one of the victims as a result of Frank not meeting his maker in the
warehouse fire.
But, of course, nobody in the Â60s or Â90s believes Frank or John.  The
strange relationship between the two is a bit like The Bone Collector,
where the paralyzed Denzel Washington investigated crimes and caught a
serial killer despite not ever leaving his bed.  Here John is Denzel and
Frank is his Angelina Jolie.  The idea of Frank and John existing in two
different layers of time, yet still talking to each other while sitting
in the same house, in the same room, at the same desk, is thoroughly
intriguing.  But if your brain doesn't hurt too much from trying to keep
up with the twists and turns of the past and present, the ending should
be pretty easy to call.
Conversely, there are some decent-sized plot holes in Frequency, as
well.  John would never be allowed to work on a murder investigation
involving his own mother.  And I know precious little about HAM radios,
but I'm pretty sure that you need to press the button down on the
microphone when you want to talk.  The film also features some of the
worst make-up since Mr. Saturday Night.  The characters that are
supposed to be aged just look stupid, which should make people
appreciate the fine job that was done aging Robin Williams and Embeth
Davidtz in Bicentennial Man.
In short, Frequency is a must-see for anyone that ever lost their
father, contacted him with a HAM radio and then solved mysteries with
him.
1:55 - PG-13 for intense violence and disturbing images

A well written tightly directed film, Frequency shows once again that Sci-Fi
done well can be an amazing deep experience.
A time travel story with a difference, Frequency is about a father and son
who establish a short wave radio link across thirty years of time.
With good intentions, information is exchanged between them that begins a
ripple effect, changing one thing after another, leading to a tense game of
cat and mouse with a serial killer.
Frequency builds to a tense and atmospheric conclusion with a couple of
twists that are hardly surprising, yet still manage to give the film a
satisfying ending.
Dennis Quaid is suprisingly good as the Father and Caviezel is even better
as the complicated and moody son. Frequency is definately worth the effort.

Review by Lars Lindahl (larsattacks@mail.com)
Starring Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Elizabeth
Mitchell, Andre Braugher, and Noah Emmerich.
Frequency n., The number of times a specified
phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the
number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values
of a periodic function per unit variation of an
independent variableÂetc
Don't worry. When watching the thriller Frequency, you
won't have to know what the heck frequency means. The
premise, although it may sound complex, is very basic
on the big screen. A New York cop, John, (Jim
Caviezel) finds a radio in his house, which allows him
to communicate with his New York firefighter father,
Frank, (Dennis Quaid) who died thirty years ago.
Immediately John warns his father that he will die
trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse. When
Frank takes his advice and survives the accident he
wasn't supposed to, the two eventually realize that by
changing that one moment in the past, they have
created a whole new future in which a serial killer
murders John's mother and nine other women. It is now
up to John and Frank to use their special connection
and save thirty years ago to make present time a
better place. (I told you that wasn't confusingÂ).  
Overall, I was very pleased with Frequency. It's
occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with
its suspenseful serial killer scenes. I usually don't
buy those cheesy "I love you dad" segments in movies,
but this one surprisingly satisfied me. Maybe because
the plot is so creative and universal that I believed
that this is how most people would act when talking to
a dead relative. Frequency's creepy premise left me
thinking once the film ended, what if? What would I
do? Would I help my own family or save a historical
figure from being assasinated? Or stop some kids from
shooting other kids? Or buy stock from Yahoo!? (a
character in the film does the latter with humorous
consequences). 
Frequency also reminded me of the fantastic Back to
the Future. Both share that "change the past slightly,
and you'll change the future heavily" warning. The
changes between the present and the past, such as
different newspaper headlines or people disappearing
and reappearing in photographs, are very similar. Both
are also wonderful feel-good family films that can
attract to a number of generations. The only
difference worth noting is that Frequency's final
scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative
sequel already in the making. 
There are some problems with the film though. First,
there is a major flaw in the story towards the end
that is somewhat distracting (Email me if you have
seen the movie and want to know what I think it is).
The plot must have confused even the filmmakers who
frequently (no pun intended) switch from 1969 to 1999
while telling the story. Another problem is that the
supporting cast, including Noah Emmerich and Andre
Braugher, are underused. While in the film, which is
not enough, the aforementioned actors steal every
scene they are in.
Frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the
audience I saw it with who cheered at the end. Even if
you know what is going to happen or if you think the
preview ruined the movie for you, like it almost did
for me, check this movie out. You may be surprised as
well.

On the surface, "Frequency" is a cross between a time travel fantasy and
a murder mystery, but at its core, the film is an unabashed love letter
to fatherhood. While the plot mechanics are convoluted, to say the least
(I've seen the movie twice and I'm still sorting it out), "Frequency"
left me with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, due mostly to the
performances of Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel.
Caviezel plays John Sullivan, a New York police officer who never fully
recovered from the loss of his father, Frank (Quaid), a firefighter who
died a hero when John was six years old. On an October night in 1999,
the eve of the 30th anniversary of that fateful day when Frank entered a
burning warehouse and never came out, John fiddles with Dad's old ham
radio and strikes up a conversation with a congenial guy from his
neighborhood in Queens.
To his amazement, John soon realizes that the person on the other end of
the radio is his father. A freak series of sunspots has somehow cut
across time, creating a radio link between 1999 and 1969. During their
initial chat, John blurts out a warning to the disbelieving man about
his pending demise. "If you'd just gone the other way, you would have
made it," he shouts as the connection fades.
The next day, Frank finds himself in the warehouse fire described the
night before. At the crucial moment, he heeds the warning and, going
against his instincts, turns the opposite direction in a blazing hallway
and emerges from the inferno alive and well.
Unfortunately, the temporal change leads to disaster. Because of an
incident triggered by Frank's survival, a serial killer that slaughtered
three women in the original timeline has now murdered 10, including
John's mother, Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell). Swapping information over the
decades, John and Frank frantically struggle to discover the identity of
the madman, so they can prevent the murder from happening.
Confused? Well, so was I. For a time travel story to work, the writer
must carefully think through the paradoxes and then find a way to make
them comprehensible to the viewer. I spent the better part of an hour
discussing the internal logic of "Frequency" with a friend and, while
she believes the writer has his cards in order, I remain less than fully
convinced.
But that's okay, because the rewards of the film come not from the time
travel business, but from the portrait of a son reaching out for his
dad. John is a good man and a fine officer, but the loss of his father
left a void that nothing else has filled. I can relate. My father passed
away 14 months ago and, whenever something interesting turns up on the
news, I still catch myself reaching for the phone to call him. My son,
who is also coping with the loss, recently told me "I wish we could make
phone calls to Heaven." In a fashion, "Frequency" fulfills that wish,
and it's hard not to choke up when hearing Frank say "Tell me about your
life, son."
Dennis Quaid is wonderful as Frank, the ideal dad. Described by his wife
as a "big kid," he splits his time between his noble profession and his
beloved family, serving as a terrific role model. Quaid's performance is
so genuine that his occasionally strained "New Yawk" accent is easy to
overlook. Jim Caviezel does fine work as well, effectively conveying the
angst of a man who goes through all the right motions, but still feels a
void inside. The supporting cast members are uniformly strong, although
they are given relatively little to do.
While Toby Emmerich's script includes some exceptional moments, it would
have been better served without the serial killer plot line. Of course,
to propel the story, something bad must happen when Frank's survival
changes time, but the murder angle has been covered in other time travel
movies, and with better clarity. Surely, Emmerich could have cooked up a
more novel crisis.
Director Gregory Hoblit presents the complex screenplay as
straightforwardly as possible. Beautifully photographed, the images are
often lyrical, particularly an overhead montage of young John riding his
bicycle in circles on the street. Hoblit adds intimacy to scenes of John
and Frank talking over the 30-year gap by superimposing both of their
faces onto the screen. He also uses special effects with restraint, a
welcome change from most contemporary movies. Come to think of it, "a
welcome change" is a fitting overall description of "Frequency." Flawed
though it may be, this is a story that delivers when it counts.

Some movies are easy to pick or pan; their brightly shining goodness 
(KEEPING THE FAITH) or dull, throbbing badness (WHERE THE MONEY IS) make 
it easy for me as a movie critic to greenlight those that I'd recommend 
my readers rush out to see, or redlight those that should be taken out 
with the day's garbage.
And then there are flicks like FREQUENCY; movies that have Issues that 
prevent me from giving them an unqualified greenlight, but that I still 
liked well enough to not apply the slow-your-roll brakes on for a 
yellowlight rating.  These are the movies, indeed, that make writing my 
reviews all the more hard.  Thus, I'm writing this on Sunday afternoon 
instead of last night after I came back from the theater, which allowed 
me to sleep on it.
But enough of this filler; on with the show.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The pretty lights in the sky--the storm known as the aurora 
borealis--have a surprise in store John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), a 
Queens cop who still mourns the death of his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 
30 years past.  As the movie opens, John, his best friend Gordo (Noah 
Emmerich), and Gordo's son Gordy Jr. (Michael Cera) discover a chest 
belonging to Frank, a firefighter during 1969; the chest contains a 
shotgun, pictures of his father--and a ham radio ("so this is what 
people used before the net, huh?") that will link him to his father in 
ways he never believed could happen.   
The radio allows John to reach out to his past and change it, affecting 
the lives of not only he and his father, but also of his mother Julia 
(Elizabeth Mitchell), the young Gordo of his past (Stephen Joffe), 
John's current boss and his father's best friend, Satch DeLeon (Andre 
Braugher), and even John himself as a young boy (Daniel Henson).  But 
changes made in the past have a direct effect on the future--John's 
present time--and because of these changes, a serial killer may have 
been allowed another chance to kill again.
Issue #1: the movie's treatment of the concept of time travel, through 
what writer Toby Emmerich (brother of Noah, who plays Gordo) calls 
"multiverses".  If you can't get past this concept and suspend your 
disbelief from the start, you will likely not be able to enjoy this 
flick.  I got past it, though I still have questions about how 
"multiverses" effect some parts of the character's lives, but not 
others.  For instance, in a scene shown in the movie's trailer **[MINOR 
SPOILER AHEAD]**, a big deal is made of the 1969 Frank putting his 
wallet in a common area for the 1999 John to find (immediately, not "in 
the future". These notes are gonna make me dizzy); similar situations 
occur throughout the movie.  That's all well and good--but if that's the 
case, why don't other everyday changes to the environment from 
"now-time" 1969, affect the now of 1999? (Yeah, definitely dizzy).  
Shouldn't simple things like the 1969 Sullivans taking items in and out 
of the refrigerator, making the bed, or even going to the bathroom 
(ugh), leave marks on the 1999 Sullivans' lives?  Hmmm... **[END MINOR 
SPOILER]**
Issue #2: the way director Gregory Hoblit chose to let the viewer know 
there was some Important! Stuff! about to happen.  Hoblit all too often 
hit the audience the dreaded Whifflebat Of Exposition, by way of using 
closeups on things that Joe Viewer should pay close attention to, as 
they would be of great import later on in the story.  There's an aurora 
borealis storm out tonight...wham!  And look! at that dead cop's 
name...wham! And watch...wham!...things drop...wham!...simultaneously... 
wham!...in slow motion...WHAM-0!   But even with that Whifflebat hitting 
me upside the head as often as it did, I still missed a couple of key 
sequences that left me wondering what was going on at certain points in 
the movie.  Lucky for me, my husband caught me up afterwards.
Issue #3: Call me picky, but if you're gonna begin with one 
premise--that using a ham radio requires you to hold down the talk 
button ("keying") to transmit--you damn well should stick with that 
premise.  I'd rather be asked to believe that you don't key the mike to 
talk, than to have characters start keying at first, but later have 
radio conversations from clear across the room with no microphone in 
sight, much less actually pushing the damn button.  Hey, I've walked out 
on movies for less; I cannot stand having my intelligence insulted, and 
this singular detail pushed my buttons.  
With all those Issues in the way, you might think I didn't like the 
movie, but actually, I did.  Though it wasn't great, it was good enough 
to keep me interested in what was going on; and the sense of sincerity 
that came across from the actors--especially Dennis Quaid and Jim 
Caviezel--made it convincing, even if it's a bit far-fetched.  Given the 
nature of the parts they're playing, a father and son caught up in what 
seems like an implausible situation, Quaid and Caviezel go beyond the 
gimmickry  in science fantasy, making the viewer believe that they have 
genuine affection for one another.  It borders on saccharine at times, 
but the movie rarely suffers for the melodrama inherent in such a tale.  
The supporting players, especially Noah Emmerich as the humorous yet 
never buffoonish Gordo, and Shawn Doyle in a particularly slimy but 
pivotal role, did well in their parts; and the younger versions of John 
and Gordo (Daniel Henson and Stephen Joffe) never came off as typical 
bratty movie kids.  The special effects and opening titles were 
well-done, and the attention paid to story-continuity, except with 
regards to one character (noted below), was noteworthy.  And if nothing 
else, FREQUENCY succeeds because it does leave the viewer pondering the 
question at its base: "What if...?"
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Issue #4: One of the best actors you've Never Seen--Andre Braugher as 
Satch DeLeon cum "Frank Pembleton".
Three side issues regarding Braugher, actually: one, his was the only 
character that did not age well.  Given that there were 30 years between 
the time that he knew both Sullivan men, Satch should have looked a lot 
older than he did in his scenes with Caviezel.  Most of the other 
characters aged correctly, but except for a few bags under his eyes and 
a gray hair or two, there was hardly any noticeable change in Satch.  It 
bothered me that I had to be reminded of last week's Rules Of Engagement 
when watching this movie; on both movie sets, whoever dropped the ball 
in Makeup, needed to be whupped.
Two, the bizarre decision to cast Braugher as a cop here; after watching 
him work magic in "The Box" as Detective Pembleton on NBC-TV's HOMICIDE: 
LIFE ON THE STREET, it was extremely disconcerting to see his character 
placed in much the same situation--and even dressed the same way, 
complete with Pembleton-like suspenders.  It was downright rude that, in 
this similar role, he had to address someone else as "Frank"--his 
character's name on the TV show.  And it was a criminal act when one 
interrogation scene with Satch and John bore shades of Frank and the 
execrable Falsone from "Homicide".  It felt like I was having a bad LSD 
flashback--and I've never touched the stuff.
And three, you've "never seen" this actor play to his full potential, 
unless like me you've seen him in "Homicide", or in the Spike Lee Joint, 
GET ON THE BUS. More's the pity--because Braugher's one baaad mutha 
[shut yo' mouth], when he's allowed to cut loose.  Forget the 
conditional "Black"; he's one of the best actors out there, period.  
Here's to Braugher, being Seen.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
FREQUENCY had lots of plot holes, and some things that made my eyes 
roll; and casting Andre Braugher in a very Frank Pembleton-like role, 
was unnecessarily confusing as far as this former "Homicide" viewer is 
concerned.  But it was interesting enough to have my husband and I 
discuss it for almost an hour after we saw it, so I'm giving it a 
qualified greenlight.  Not great, and the science (fiction) is iffy, but 
the special effects were very well done, and the audience was cheering 
and crying in all the right spots.  It's certainly worth a look-see.
FREQUENCY (rating: greenlight): 
But stop me before I say something corny like "received transmission 
loud and clear".

Logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility. Considering that
the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is
the idea of altered realities, writing a script that deals with this
problem is an imposing task. Occasionally, we get a film that does
manage it. Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" was one such film. But more
frequently, we get films that don't much deal with it at all. There is
one question to ask in this case: Does the film have other virtues
that override the existing logical inconsistencies? The "Terminator"
films made up for them with exciting action, "Back to the Future" did
it with an entertaining story, and the new film "Frequency" pulls off
the trick with a strong package of its own.  Is "Frequency" filled
with plot holes? Yes. Does it matter? Not really.
The film opens in October of 1969. Firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis
Quaid) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job,
then goes home to his loving wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) and son
Johnny (Daniel Henson). The double-pronged story flashes forward to
1999, where Johnny (now Jim Caviezel) is all grown up and working as a
police detective. A strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora
borealis over New York City -- allows father and son to communicate
through the same ham radio Frank used in '69 and that John has found
in the present day. Though both are initially skeptical of the idea,
John eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his
impending death in a warehouse fire, and he succeeds in saving Frank
from certain doom. Now flooded with memories of a full life with his
father alive, John is initially overjoyed, until he discovers that the
changes to the timeline have been disastrous: A serial killer that
would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women. Frank and
John now must work together to set things right, with John using the
information he has gathered in the future to instruct Frank on what to
do in the past.
The premise of "Frequency" is unusual, and requires getting over one
very important mental hurdle to fully accept: John and Frank are the
only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result
of their actions.  This isn't explained; you just have to go with
it. When Frank doesn't die in a fire, John is the only one who
remembers it differently, while everyone else remembers it the new
way. The concept also runs into problems concerning just how
synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each
other. Sometimes Frank's changing the past results in something
happening right away in John's world, and sometimes John gets the
changes ahead of time. Now, the filmmakers might have perfectly good
explanations for this, and I could probably come up with something
fairly convoluted (but nevertheless logical) if I thought about it
hard enough (for example, the reason John gets advance information of
the serial killer's murders was because the change had already
happened in Frank's world, and John is only witnessing the
*projection* of that change), but explanations aren't really the
point. When "Frequency" gets cooking, it's a riveting little thriller,
even if it is confusing. What matters to a film like this is if the
plot makes sense in the moment, and "Frequency" works as long as it
keeps moving.
The film manages to be engaging despite the logical
confusion. Director Gregory Hoblit and screenwriter Toby Emmerich
structure "Frequency" as good Hollywood entertainment, establishing
decent, likable characters, making us care for them, and setting up a
goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved. I liked many of the
creative touches: the split screens, allowing us to see how the
universe is being affected in both realities, and the greater
framework of baseball to drive the action forward. It actually uses
the 1969 Mets-Orioles World Series (the one that featured the Amazin'
Mets) to great effect -- Frank uses John's advance knowledge of the
Series outcome to convince his friends to believe him. (Admittedly,
this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself.) I
even liked the final scene, which features Frank and John both
fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods. Some
may find this scene blindingly confusing, as the reality shifts start
coming fast and furious, but it does make sense if you think about it
(and give the script a lot of leeway), and let's face it: It's a darn
cool way to end the film. There are enough surprises and plot twists
in "Frequency" to keep you on your toes, and as a result the movie
avoids growing stagnant.
The other major thing to appreciate about "Frequency" is the handling
of the father-son relationship. Quaid and Caviezel carry off their
parts easily; it's a rock-solid job from both actors. The relationship
is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the
high concept: How would one react to being able to communicate with a
dead relative, or with a future descendant? Watching the exchanges
between Frank and John will give you a pretty good idea of how to
answer that question. The credibility of the human relationship is
absolutely crucial to the rest of the film; if we don't believe in the
characters, we don't care about the outcome of the thriller
plot. Here, we do care, because we like the lead actors. I also liked
some of the supporting cast members. Elizabeth Mitchell gets stuck
with two thankless roles, playing Julia the doting wife *and* mother,
but still performs admirably. Andre Braugher, late of the television
show "Homicide: Life on the Street," gives a nice supporting turn as
Frank's best friend and future colleague of John. He has a lovely
scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to Julia
while Frank's World Series predictions come true before his very
eyes. Braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here,
simultaneously dismayed and amused.
Perhaps the only thing I didn't like about "Frequency" is the overly
sentimental coda, during which the camera's focus goes a little too
soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard. But that's only
because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to
cheap tactics. I freely acknowledge that "Frequency" may best work as
a "guy" movie, since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of
father-son relationships (echoes of "Field of Dreams" can be easily
heard), but the underlying concept is universally applicable. Who
wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent?  Or see how their
children turn out? "Tell me about your life, son" -- excuse me while I
mist up. And don't call me a sissy.

Simply put, the best film of the year so far. We film reviewers see three or
four (or more) pictures a week, so you may not need any further convincing.
But if you do ... read on. And for those of you that trust this reviewer and
like surprises, stop reading and go see the film!
The sun's flares (nicely visually represented) spool upward (to the tune of
"Crimson and Clover") 93 million miles away from our spinning planet,
causing beautiful blue neon illuminations across the starry starry night
skies of a 1969 and 1999 New York city. These freak conditions cross
wavelengths with time, making the impossible possible as a 36 year old son
talks to his 40 year old (and currently deceased) father over an old H.A.M.
radio transceiver.
The father and son connections, which occur in the same room, but three
decades apart, are so thick and resonating you'll want the entire film to
remain focused on them. Though never leaving that relationship, "Frequency"
pitches a cops and homicide story to boot. Pay attention, toggles in time
are not always announced with convenient captions - which adds to the
allure, mystery, and off-kilter swirl.
A tasty fire motif simmers under whirling planet simulations that surface at
the right times and places to keep the perspective appropriately wide and
tilted. All elements merge in a constructive interference to create a
wonderfully eerie aura (or should I say aurora?) that will swell your chest
and dominate your breath, enlarging your nostrils, hardening your Adam's
apple and moistening your tear ducts. The woman beside me rolled back and
forth, alternately crying out, blowing her nose, laughing, and covering her
eyes like an infant.
I have only two contentions, both of which are minor and may actually have
good explanations (if you know ... send them in.) 1) Fire-triggered
sprinkler systems in a 1969 police station? 2) How did son John know the
specific choices in the moment prior to his father's death? (Btw, Jim
Caviezel is awesome.)
"Backdraft" plus "The Sixth Sense" equals "Frequency." I'd have titled it:
"A Matter of Time," "Father and Sun Flares," "The Same Wavelength,"
"Communication Hertz" or "Serial Killer and H.A.M." Hey, stop reading and go
see it!

     Just when I thought I'd seen every possible spin on the serial killer
thriller, here comes FREQUENCY to show that there is something new under
the sun. The serial killer story in this case is wrapped up in a fantasy
story about a troubled cop named John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), whose
entire life has been affected by the death of his firefighter dad Frank
(Dennis Quaid) 30 years earlier. But strange atmospheric phenomena are
afoot, and when John pulls out his dad's old ham radio, he manages to pull
in none other than dad himself, chatting from 30 years in the past. John
sees this as an opportunity not just to get to know Frank, but to save his
life with his foreknowledge as well. Unfortunately, one piece of changed
history has a domino effect on other events, including the death of John's
mother Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) at the hands of -- that's right -- a
serial killer.
     Time-travel tales are inevitably head-scratching affairs if you
ponder them for too long, and FREQUENCY is no exception. It posits a
strange side effect of the father-son communication -- when John
successfully prevents Frank from dying as he had in _his_ past, he is left
the only one who remembers a world in which Frank died in 1969, though he
also finds himself newly-flooded with memories of 30 years of life with
dad. It's an utterly preposterous conceit, of course, but it actually
works. Caviezel never once smirks at the material, resulting in a
performance full of convincingly pent-up emotion. Director Gregory
Hoblit's staging of John's new montage of memory is surprisingly
affecting; Caviezel's work as a man re-discovering his father is better
than you have any reason to expect in a genre film.
     Now, did I mention that this all turns into a serial killer thriller
at some point? Yes, it is soon discovered that saving Frank's life has set
in motion events that will cost Julia hers. Father and son team up across
time to send Frank on a search for the rogue cop (Shawn Doyle) responsible
for a series of murders. Hoblit and screenwriter Toby Emmerich might have
chosen to explore the ramifications of continuing to mess with history,
but that would be a bit too philosophically deep. They're content to set
up a series of neat sequences that show the instantaneous impact of one
decision 30 years earlier on the world of the present. FREQUENCY is a
genuinely snappy piece of film-making, far and away the liveliest work
from Hoblit (who got bogged down in the grim subject matter of PRIMAL FEAR
and FALLEN), even when you're inspired to a round of "yeah, right."
     There's no question that much of FREQUENCY is smart and entertaining,
but it's also a fragmented piece of work. For the first half of the film,
it's a fantasy with a strong human side, anchored by an unconventional but
convincing father-son relationship. In the second hour, it shifts
dramatically to a creep-show, with the sinister killer popping up at
terribly inconvenient times. That makes for some crowd-pleasing chases and
struggles, but a terribly rote plot progression. Though there are still
some well-crafted scenes -- Andre Braugher gets a particularly good one as
a cop friend of Frank's watching a World Series prediction come true --
character ceases to matter for all practical purposes. 
     It suddenly matters again in FREQUENCY's achingly sentimental
denouement, which gets all FIELD OF DREAMS on us by tying father-son
connections to baseball. The strange thing is that it probably wouldn't
have felt nearly as overwrought if FREQUENCY had stuck with the tone of
its first half. The shift from character piece to thriller is jarring
enough; the attempt to shift back to character piece feels like an 
unearned piece of manipulation. It's easy to recommend FREQUENCY for the
things it does right in each of its incarnations, but the recommendation
can't be too enthusiastic when those incarnations are so incongruous. I
think there's a reason we've never seen this sort of serial killer
thriller before: It's awfully hard to make a serial killer thriller a
tear-jerker as well.

Directed by Gregory Hoblit. Screenplay by Tobias Emmerich. Starring Dennis
Quaid, James Caviezel, Elizabeth Mitchell. Running time: 121 minutes. 
Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 4th, 2000.
One of the big problems with many movies about changing history is that 
they tend to get bogged down in its mechanics. The difficulty is that our 
modern understanding of time is still incredibly limited, so any such 
discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook.  
Good movies like "Back To The Future" ignore the subject altogether, or 
at most give it a passing acknowledgement. Their makers are aware that 
the fun thing about time isn't how it works, but how it can be used in a 
dramatic context. "Frequency" is such a film, and it proves to be one of
the most entertaining movies of the year so far.
John Sullivan (James Caviezel) is a cop in 1999 New York. He has just 
broken up with his girlfriend, drinks a little too much, and is all too 
aware that it's almost the thirtieth anniversary of the death of his 
father. Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) was a firefighter who perished in 
1969 rescuing a transient from a warehouse fire. One night, John happens 
upon his dad's old ham radio, mothballed since Frank's demise. For old 
times' sake, he switches it on.
A lot of things were happening in New York around the time of Frank's 
death. The "Amazing" Mets were on their way to winning the World Series 
against the Baltimore Orioles. A serial killer murdered four nurses 
before vanishing without a trace. And the aurora borealis -- the Northern 
Lights -- was making a rare week-long appearance in the skies above the 
city.
In 1999, the Northern Lights have returned to New York for the first time 
in three decades. By some freak accident of nature, this allows John to 
speak to Frank in 1969 via the ham radio. John manages to convince his 
father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting 
events of the Mets/Orioles World Series, and gives him enough information 
about the warehouse fire to save his life. But this changes the whole 
pattern of history, and not all for the good. Somehow, Frank's survival 
has meant that the so-called Nightingale Killer's death toll was ten 
instead of four -- and one of the "new" victims was John's mother 
Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell). Frank and John must cooperate across the 
years to stop the murderer in time.
"Frequency" is not a particularly deep movie. In a way it's about the 
relationship between fathers and sons, and how profoundly the absence of 
the former can affect the latter. And of course it deals with the 
familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous 
event can have major ramifications on things long after.
But, in the end, the real point of "Frequency" is just to tell a good 
story, and in this it excels. There are a lot of great scenes in which 
Frank and John's altering of history is explored, not on a 
pseudoscientific level but on a purely visceral one. The movie doesn't 
try to justify its temporal mechanics (indeed, there are some 
inconsistencies in how Frank's actions ripple down to his son), but just 
taps into our sense of the fantastic.
For example, at one point Frank communicates with John by burning a 
message into his desk. John sees the letters appear one by one and 
touches them, expecting to find them hot. But of course they're not, 
because they were made thirty years earlier. Later, Frank acquires a 
wallet with the murderer's fingerprints on it, but can't go to the police 
in 1969 because they'd never believe his story. So he hides the wallet 
beneath a loose floorboard, where John retrieves it in 1999. "Wow," 
breathes Frank, and he is speaking as much for the audience as for 
himself. While these sorts of things are nothing new to the genre, rarely 
have they been done so well and with such enthusiasm. And there are a 
couple of particularly imaginative sequences, especially a visually 
awesome one at the movie's climax.
The only real downside to "Frequency" is that the serial killer storyline 
which dominates its second half is rather pedestrian. This is not to say 
that it's badly done -- it's intriguing enough in its own way -- but it 
just doesn't live up to the wonder which permeates the rest of the movie. 
Scenes like one where Frank is arrested for being the Nightingale killer 
seem commonplace, for instance, and the proceedings generally feel as 
though they've been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of "Law 
And Order".
But even this is energised by excellent performances from Caviezel and 
particularly Quaid. "Frequency" lives or dies on the conviction of their 
father/son relationship, made more challenging by the fact that their 
communications aren't face-to-face. But both actors are up to the task, 
bringing genuine emotion to the story. As a result, it's easy to suspend 
our disbelief and buy into the movie, and it's hard to suppress a cheer 
when Frank survives the fire, or when father and son team up to stop the 
killer.
Director Gregory Hoblit does a good job, especially in keeping the
frequent and potentially dull scenes of Frank and John talking on the 
radio alive and interesting. Also, he wisely chooses not to overplay the 
changes father and son have wrought on the present. Although some 
differences are highlighted, many others are left as subtle background 
detail. Like "Back To The Future", this gives the film a richness it 
would otherwise be lacking.
"Frequency" has a broad appeal that's rare in movies today. It's a 
science-fiction movie where the characters come first, where visual 
effects take a backseat to story and acting, but which is exciting and 
suspenseful nonetheless. "Frequency" probably won't win any Academy 
Awards, but it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've 
had in a long time. And, in the end, I can't ask for much more than that.

     The time travel/time bending genre always seems worn out.  The very
topic lends itself to the production of hacky movies like Millennium,
and yet I am constantly surprised to see one film after another making
good on the hidden promise of the genre.  Witness the Back to the Future
series and the powerful 12 Monkeys.  As it turns out, mucking with time
actually pays off more often than not!
     Not only is Frequency a good flick, it's fully worthy of a place
among one of the best timetwisters ever made.
     Incorrectly being marketed as a sci-fi movie (not to mention
poorly-titled and bearing the dumb tagline "What if it changed
everything?"), Frequency is the story of a father and son, reunited
across time through a ham radio and the rare appearance of the aurora
borealis over Queens.
     In 1969, Dad Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a star firefighter with a
loving family.  30 years later, his son John (Jim Caviezel) is a NYC
cop.  When John, just about scraping the bottom of his life, finds his
long-dead dad's old radio set in a footlocker, he plugs it in and hears
a mysterious voice on the other end.  As you can imagine, beyond all
expectation, it's his father communicating from back in time... the day
before he is about to die.
     Frequency soon becomes infinitely more complex when John tells
Frank of his imminent demise.  "Go the other way" in that burning
warehouse, and he would have lived.  A skeptical Frank tests Jim's
prognostications (the "Amazin' Mets" World Series being the backdrop for
the 1969 action), and when the warehouse fire materializes as promised,
Frank decides to take the advice, surviving the blaze.
     All those geeky "what if" questions you may have had about mucking
with the past are addressed in Frequency, with much of the film taking
on the form of a whodunit, as father and son try to find a serial killer
that crops up when Frank's survival alters the course of history.  The
twists and turns are fascinating and unpredictable; in fact, Frequency
marks one of the extremely few times I've watched a movie where I
honestly had no idea what was going to happen next.
     Even more amazing is that Frequency marks writer Toby Emmerich's
first script: Emmerich is actually a music executive at New Line
Cinema!  Director Gregory Hoblit's best-known work is probably that dog
of a movie Primal Fear, and he's come up with genius here.  And the
acting is first-rate, especially Quaid, who I haven't seen shine in a
decade.  Altogether, if there is any justice in the world, Frequency
should become this year's Sixth Sense.

Susan Granger's review of "FREQUENCY" (New Line Cinema)
   Once you see this movie, you can't stop thinking about
it. "Frequency" poses the question: What if you could travel back in
time and change your past?  That's the dilemma that faces NYPD
Detective John Sullivan (John Caviezel) who discovers that, while
using an old ham radio just when a natural phenomenon, an aurora
borealis, is lighting up the night sky, he is actually talking with a
man who died 30 years earlier - his ownfather.  Back in 1969, his dad,
Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), was killed fighting a warehouse
fire. But what if John could warn his father and, thereby, save his
life? It's worth a try, isn't it? But, then, if it works, the past is
inexorably changed, so what happens to the present? That'sall I'm
going to tell you about the plot. Like "The Sixth Sense," this is not
a movie you want to know too much about.  Toby Emmerich has writtena
stunning, multi-layered thriller that's part murder mystery,
involvinga serial killer, part family drama, revolving around the
loving relationship of father and son. Science-fiction time-travel
fantasy goes back to Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and Emmerich's
imaginative contribution is cutting-edge. Credibility is maintained
and continuity matches, despite thecomplicated plot twists and
mind-bending paradoxes involving temporal intersections with parallel
universes. Director Gregory Hoblit ("Primal Fear") keeps the action
fast-paced and the tension taut, shooting the ham radio scenes like a
live, multi-camera TV show. What's on the screen is totally
entertaining, emotionally gripping, and so thought-provoking that you
may want to see it twice. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Frequency" is an exciting, surprising 10.  If you're into
edge-of-the-seat suspense pulling the cosmic strings of time travel,
"Frequency" will light your fuse.
