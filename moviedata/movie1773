January is known as a cinematic wasteland, a dumping ground where studios
to unload the dreck they've been hiding in the dark corners of their
shelves.  So it's quite refreshing to see premiering in the first month of
the year a film with some degree of intelligence such as Gregory Hoblit's
Fallen.  While the basic ideas behind this supernatural thriller remain
more intriguing than their development and execution, Fallen is nonetheless
an effective chiller that entertains and leaves audiences plenty to think
about.
The setup as shown in the film's previews is deceptively simple.  The
execution of serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, picking up where he
left off in Crash) does not spell the end of his conflict with idealistic
homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington).  Apparently, the
execution has only freed his evil spirit to inhabit other bodies to do his
sadistic bidding, passing from vessel to vessel through mere touch.
As the film progresses, it is revealed that the force that Hobbes must now
confront is much larger than expected, and this is where Fallen becomes
deeper and more intriguing than most fright shows.  Interesting points
about theology and the nature of evil are brought up by screenwriter
Nicholas Kazan and director Hoblit, who enable the audience to suspend
their disbelief by giving it time to digest the supernatural occurrences
and explanations after they are served up a little at a time (though Hoblit
allows the viewers a bit _too_much_ time--the film's pacing should have
been much tighter).  However, this is also where Fallen runs into some
trouble, for a few points are not resolved to satisfaction.  For instance,
it is never satisfactorily explained why the spirit can easily enter some
people and not others; "purity of soul" is offered as a reason, but what
exactly distinguishes that?
But these quibbles can be swept under the rug, due to Hoblit's stylish
direction and, most of all, the presence of the ever-charismatic and
convincing Washington.  He has such a natural rapport with the audience
that we instantly believe what he does, and when he is finally convinced of
what exactly is going on, we have no problem accepting the situation,
either.  His supporting cast, which includes John Goodman (as Hobbes's
partner, Jonesy) and Donald Sutherland (as their superior), isn't given a
whole lot to do (Embeth Davidtz, as a theologan who helps Hobbes, plays
merely a walking vessel of exposition).
Fallen is a flawed film, but it at least requires the viewer to think,
especially after the jolting conclusion.  That's a lot more than most
January releases have to offer; then again, I'd venture to guess that
that's a lot more than what most releases this entire year will have to offer.

"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he
didn't exist."  So says Kevin Spacey's character in The Usual Suspects,
a far, far better movie than Fallen.  Fallen stands for the opposite
premise:  that the devil walks among us and wants to convince us that he
does exist.  Or anyway, that he wants to convince Denzel Washington that
he exists.
This devil's name is Azazel, and he's by far the most interesting
character in Fallen, by virtue of being the only interesting character
in Fallen.  (In a movie like this, being interesting is a virtue.)
Azazel is left-handed, enjoys injecting people with poison, and likes to
sing a particular Rolling Stones song (no, not Sympathy for the Devil",
but "Time is on My Side").  He has spent the last few years in prison,
possessing the body of a serial killer, and when the killer is executed,
Azazel is free to walk among us, transferring his evil nature from body
to body by touch.
Azazel's motto, as one of the possessed tells us, is "maximum fun".  Fun
for Azazel is tormenting poor homicide detective John Hobbes
(Washington), the only man that he can't enter through touch.  So Azazel
begins killing people in a style reminiscent of the recently-executed
serial killer -- crimes that the baffled Hobbes is called on to solve,
and is eventually suspected of committing himself.
Fallen has two specific obstacles to face, succeding in one and failing
in the other.  The first problem  -- turning a powerful, invisible
spirit into a movie villian --  is handled quite well.  There's a couple
of very nice scenes where we see Azazel transferred from host to host
like the virus in Outbreak.  Also, the people Azazel possesses carry
around a Steadicam with some weird yellow filter on it, so the audience
can see things from the demon's perspective.  And the people that Azazel
possesses are extremely well-cast.  They all have a demonic glint in
their eye when they're playing the part of Azazel.
The second problem is:  how do you make all this interesting?  Well, you
don't.  The main problem with this movie is Washington's character, who
is written to be dull and plodding.  Denzel, like the good actor he is,
dutifully plays his part in a dull and plodding style -- although he's
not able to outdo his partner John Goodman, who's so boring he's almost
narcoleptic.  And the movie ambles slowly along, following Detective
Hobbes along the connect-the-dots plot of the gratuitous little clues
that Azazel leaves strewn everywhere.  There's nothing in the movie to
lighten its leaden tread.
Fallen is Moviemaking Light:  a thriller with no thrills, an interesting
premise with no substance, a decent twist ending that comes about a
half-hour too late, featuring good actors trapped inside a mindless
script.  One wants to ask the writers and producers filmed this
pointless, overlong story, but the answer seems guaranteed to be:  "The
devil made me do it."  The greatest trick this movie could pull off
would be in making us believe that it never existed.

FALLEN (director: Gregory Hoblit; screenwriter: Nicholas Kazan;
cinematographer: Newton Thomas Sigel; editor: Lawrence Jordan; cast:
Elias Koteas (Edgar Reese), Denzel Washington (John Hobbes), John
Goodman (Jonesy), Donald Sutherland (Lt. Stanton), Embeth Davidtz
(Gretta Milano), James Gandolfini (Lou), Robert Joy (Charles), Gabriel
Casseus (Art ), Michael J. Pagan (Sam), 1998)
It takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this
outlandish plot: the devil is in our heads and was placed there by
ordinary contact with others (it spreads like germs do), even though it
is played with zeal and candor by Denzel Washington, who is the
squeaky-clean super Detective John Hobbes. He works with his partner of
12+ years, Jonesy (John Goodman), on homicides. The occult thriller
takes too long to develop (over two hours) and when it finally gets to
where it is going, it ends up nowhere.
The film is basically a horror film teaser, trying to say something
about Azazel that it really can't say without sounding ridiculous. It
uses the Rolling Stones' 1960s theme song of "Time Is on My Side" to
make its own theme become indelibly linked with all the serial murders
and tries to give the film a noir feel to it, with a constant voiceover
by Denzel trying to explain how incredible it is that his life is
falling apart. There is also heavy use of fuzzy camera images by the
cinematographer to indicate that the devil was being photographed from
his point of view. These shots of the devil's viewpoint were overworked
into the script to the point of overkill. The film worked only on a
superficial level, as light entertainment and should be given credit
for, at least, attempting to have a literate script. It is basically an
escapist film, that failed to build-up tension as the story went on.
Indeed, by the film's last scene, the story waned in interest, proving
mosly that time wasn't on its side.
The film opens with a flashback and voiceover by Detective Hobbes: "I
want to tell you about the time I almost died,'' and then he tells of
the events that led up to the dire predicament he now is in, as we see
him crawling on his hands and knees in an isolated snowy area in the
woods. It then cuts to Death Row, where a killer, Reese (Elias Koteas),
is about to go to the gas chamber. His death is being filmed by the
ACLU. Hobbes is among the witnesses to the execution and sees the killer
in his cell before he is brought out to the gas chamber, where the
killer sings to him "Time Is on My Side," mumbles some mumbo jumbo,
grabs the detective's hand, and tells him a riddle: Where is there a
space between Lyons and Spakowsky? The camera shot of his death in the
gas chamber, shows his physical death, but there is a point-of-view
aerial shot that reveals that the evil spirit is loose. In seconds, the
spirit climbs into the body of its next victim and takes him over.
Thusly, we have all been duly prepped for the supernatural part of the
story to follow.
Hobbes then returns to the police station in Philadelphia, which he
loves so much. We see him smugly on TV as the hero cop who made the
pinch of the executed killer; we see him happily at home with his
brother and nephew; and, then we see him interact good-naturedly with
his co-workers-- his boss, the reticent Lieutenant Stanton (Donald
Sutherland), his good-friend Jonesy, and a sleazy cop, Lou (Gandolfini),
who tries to ride him for being a saint. These scenes have a good feel
to them as they are grounded in reality and capture the feel of the
detective world Hobbes inhabits.
Soon he begins receiving late-night hang-up phone calls, just like Reese
used to do to him. Then a copycat killer starts working on apparently
random victims, as the police can find no motives for the crime. A
corpse is found in a bathtub while the killer, strangely, stayed for
breakfast being in no rush to leave the apartment. Hobbes notices that
the dead man in the bathtub is the same man who brushed past him last
night, noticeably trying to draw his attention. The linguist brought
into the case, says that the words on the videotape of Reese, were
spoken in ancient Aramaic, a language not spoken in the last two
thousand years.
Through the inadvertent help of Lou, Hobbes discovers the answer to
Reese's riddle is on the wall plaque for hero cops in the stationhouse,
where the missing name between Lyons and Spakowsky is of a former hero
policeman, who was later accused of being a serial killer and committed
suicide. Hobbes researches the cop's name on an internet search engine
and then contacts his daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), to ask
her why her father went to his country house to commit suicide. When
Hobbes visits the country house, he finds books on the occult and the
word Azazel written on the dusty wall.
Ms. Milano, who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology,
tells Hobbes, "If you value your life, if there's even one human being
you care about, walk away from this case." But it is too late for the
detective, as his fingerprints are found in two serial murders uncovered
and he is being falsely accused of these crimes just like her father
was.
By this time, the story lost its base of reality. The evil spirit that
couldn't die moves from person to person, and there is a chase scene in
a crowd where the possessed pursuer could be anyone, which was exciting
to watch, but added little to the meaning of the story.
Denzel's noir-like voiceover seemed artificial, an imitation of how a
real noir film operates. He was also not convincing as a noir
protagonist, he seemed more like a cop who was in a horror movie but
might have been better off being in a straight movie about a cop being
framed by corrupt cops. The premise of the occult tale was too silly to
take seriously. But the film plodded on, getting more ridiculous by the
minute, until it ended on a note of surprise, in the twisted manner one
expected a film like this to end on.

     Call it TOUCHED BY A DEMON.  Gregory Hoblit's FALLEN is a serial 
killer movie with an unusual, horrific twist.  If marketed properly, 
this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate 
supernatural tales like THE PROPHESY and those who crave grim, dark 
thrillers like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN.  In fact, there's even a 
little TWIN PEAKS to be found here, albeit with the lion's share of the 
weirdness distilled out.  (Remember BOB?)  The biggest failing of FALLEN 
is that, although it's consistently interesting, it's not always as edgy 
and suspenseful as one might hope.
     A serial killer (Elias Koteas) has been on the loose in 
Philadephia, but Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington), the noblest 
man on the police force, has brought him to justice.  Now, during his 
last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas 
chamber, the mass murderer cryptically tells Hobbes, "What goes around 
really goes around."  Shortly thereafter, he begins to sing "Time Is on 
My Side" as he's taken on his last walk.  Minutes later, the State of 
Pennsylvania has carried out the execution and Edgar Reese is dead.  But 
for Hobbes, the nightmare is just beginning, because Reese wasn't a 
normal psychopath  he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named 
Azazel. And, with Reese's death, Azazel is free to hop from body to 
body, murdering and wreaking havoc at will. Only Hobbes and a pretty, 
female theology teacher (Embeth Davidtz) have an inkling of what they're 
up against.  The rest of the cops, including Hobbes' partner, Jonesy 
(John Goodman); Lou (James Gandolfini), a newcomer to the department; 
and Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland), don't have a clue, and, as a 
result, they are in mortal danger.
     As depicted by Hoblit (PRIMAL FEAR) and cinematographer Newton 
Thomas Sigel, Philadelphia is a dark, dreary place  a gothic city 
rather than a modern one.  No skyscrapers or other monoliths of current 
architecture or technology are shown.  The most famous landmark to 
appear isn't the Liberty Bell or Independence Hall; it's Geno's Steaks.  
Shadows and night scenes abound.  The days are cloudy and unpromising.  
This is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen 
angels walk among men.
     FALLEN's plot is brimming with potential, not all of which is 
realized.  Somehow, I would have expected a more frightening tale to 
emerge from something with this kind of premise.  But the level of 
terror, like that of gore, is kept in check.  Nevertheless, there are 
several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of Azazel moves from 
body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city 
sidewalks.  The film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can 
best be described as unusual.
     Of the several dozen actors to play Azazel, the best is by far 
Elias Koteas (EXOTICA, CRASH), who, despite only being on screen for 
about ten minutes, gives a fantastically charged performance.  John 
Goodman also seems to be enjoying himself, although his role for most of 
the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick.  Sadly, however, 
these two are the only ones who excel.  Everyone else, including Denzel 
Washington, is boring.
     Washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of 
the film.  It's not that he's bad per se, but he's not very interesting.  
There's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he 
portrays his character, and that keeps us distanced, however slightly, 
from Hobbes.  As circumstances become progressively more dire for the 
cop, and as his life-or-death chess game with Azazel approaches the 
point of checkmate, I expected to be more on the edge of my seat than I 
was.  Washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this; I 
never felt a sense of urgency.
     However, at least Washington was believable, which is more than can 
be said for Embeth Davidtz (SCHINDLER'S LIST) and Donald Sutherland.  To 
be fair, the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related; 
neither Stanton nor Gretta Milano are well-written.  That said, however, 
there's nothing inspired about either Davidtz's or Sutherland's work.  
Both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts, as if they 
know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot 
rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual.
     Narratively, FALLEN has a few glaring weaknesses.  Although the 
plot proceeds with a convoluted, game-like structure, it uses a Denzel 
Washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters.  At times, this is 
actually helpful, and it has a use beyond the obvious, but there are 
occasions when ponderous lines like "I like the night Sometimes you 
come face to face with yourself" become a little hard to swallow.  In 
addition, FALLEN is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland, 
generic theology embraced by numerous movies and TV shows like TOUCHED 
BY AN ANGEL.
     However, despite the negatives, I'm still recommending FALLEN on 
the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending, which I 
loved.  The final scenes are startling, audacious, and unexpected.  It's 
not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one 
did.  At a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes, 
FALLEN manages to buck the trend and redeem itself.  This is not a great 
motion picture, but, considering how bad most January releases are, it's 
a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours.  And, whatever you do, 
don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll.

"No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our
feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"

     Things are indeed rather dangerous for police homicide detective
John Hobbes, played by Denzel Washington, who begins the film saying
"Let me tell you about the time I almost died."  Hobbes is the
detective who caught the serial killer Edgar Reese (played by Elia
Koteas).  Reese seems mightily unconcerned to be heading into the gas
chamber.  Besides merrily singing "Time Is On My Side," he wildly
shakes Washington's hand and babbles in some gibberish language.  He
may be the most cheerful soul who was ever strapped into this gas
chamber and executed.  Then in an unexplained shot we seem to see
Reese's viewpoint rise from the body and settle into a guard.  Reese's
murder spree should be over.  Unfortunately the killings stubbornly
refuse to stop complete with Reese's particular trademarks.  Hobbes and
his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) have to figure out why.  At the
murder scenes now there start appearing for Hobbes clues left in the
form of riddles.  The clues seem to point at a previous case involving
a policeman named Milano who turned murderer and eventually committed
suicide.  Hobbes wants to find out more about this case and questions
the dead officer's daughter (Embeth Davidtz) who has since become a
religious fanatic, surrounding herself with images of angels.  Hobbes
investigates the cabin that was the site of the Milano suicide and
finds the name of a demon painted on the wall.
     Some aspects of this film are done very nicely.  Tom Sigel's
photography creates a nice somber mood of doom and dread.  His previous
work includes THE USUAL SUSPECTS and BLOOD AND WINE.  Sigel creates a
tone to his photography effectively.  Nicholas Kazan has a good ear for
dialog which director Gregory Hoblit brings out, most noticeable as
Hobbes and Jonesy discuss the case.  But the story is really a patching
together of familiar ideas from other police thrillers and even some
science fiction films.  As is all too frequent in films, the real
killer is much to anxious to strut his stuff and reveals much too much
to the police.  Presumably the killer wants to give the police a
handicap to make the game more interesting for himself, rubbing their
noses in the fact that they cannot stop him, but it is too common a
device to advance the plot.  Also too common are "false alarm" scenes
intended to make the viewer jump.  These touches in the script are
signs of weak writing.
     Denzel Washington does a competent job here, but he brings nothing
to his part any other capable actor could not have.  On the positive
side, there in nothing in the script that draws attention to the fact
that the character is black.  It is simply cast with a black man; it is
not a black role.  But Washington could have done a lot more with it.
The real acting honors in this film go to John Goodman who takes the
role of partner and invests it with real personality.  Donald
Sutherland is there being officious and just slightly sinister, a role
that he can manage in his sleep.  Embeth Davidtz gives her character a
certain vulnerable courage.  Davidtz formerly played Helen Hirsch in
SCHINDLER'S LIST and has understandably not found a role of such
substance since.
     FALLEN is something of a hybrid film which probably falls more
into the camp of the horror film than that of the police drama, though
it rarely approaches anything really frightening.  One very nice
sequence has the killer demonstrating his abilities to Hobbes through
the use of innocent bystanders.  It is perhaps the most effective scene
of the film, giving the homicide detective and the viewer a feel for
how difficult the killer will be to catch.  Not everything in this film
works as well as it might, but FALLEN does build to a nice keep-em-
guessing finale.  I rate this film a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

     Sometimes it is in the casting phase of pre-production that a
film's success is assured, and so it is with FALLEN, a detective story
and supernatural thriller starring Denzel Washington as Det. John
Hobbes.
     With a smartly written script by Academy Award nominee Nicholas
Kazan (REVERSAL OF FORTUNE) and deft direction by Gregory Hoblit,
FALLEN tells a detective story with a different solution but classic
police tracking.  Hoblit, the director of PRIMAL FEAR, that
underappreciated gem from last year, takes a concept that has schlock
potential written all over it and fashions it into an intensely
compelling motion picture.
     "I want to tell you about the time I almost died," Det. Hobbes
tells us in the story's opening line.  "I never thought it would happen
to me, not at this age."  Washington's warm intonation of the prescient
and insightful voice-overs sets the tone for all of the key events in
the drama.
     As the story starts, a convict on death row faces execution.
Elias Koteas, last seen in CRASH and GATTACA, plays the creepy serial
killer Edgar Reese.  Det. Hobbes, who put Reese away, comes to his
execution.  Both are utterly confident, with a gum chewing Det. Hobbes
relaxed and a prancing Reese hyperactive.  As Reese begins to taunt
Hobbes, Reese speaks in a variety of language, especially ancient
Aramaic, and shoots out his hand to touch Hobbes.  Once in the gas
chamber, Reese bursts out singing, "Time is on my side; yes it is."
This recurring song becomes one of filmdom's most effectively chilling
use of a single song.
     "Something is always happening," Det. Hobbes tells us.  "But when
it happens, people don't always see it or accept it."  Soon after
Reese's execution, a series of mysterious murders starts, and the story
surrounds the investigation of these murders.
     Det. Hobbes works in a realistically cluttered police station
office.  The film's excellent supporting cast includes John Goodman as
his partner Jonesy, James Gandolfini as fellow office Lou and Donald
Sutherland as his boss Lt. Stanton.  Although the other actors get
fresh roles, Sutherland plays his usual slightly sinister part.  Lt.
Stanton, who knows something he's not telling, tries to get Det. Hobbes
to stop his involvement in the investigation of the new murders.
     Director Hoblit's precise staging has it just right with none
better than the touching scenes.  With touch playing a central element
in the story, he sets up a fast paced sequence on a crowded city street
that gets your adrenaline pumping.  And cinematographer Tom Sigel
switches from person to person using techniques first popularized in
SLACKER.
     As the story advances, we know more than Det. Hobbes, but the
fascination comes from watching Hobbes unravel the mystery.  As Gretta
Milano, Embeth Davidtz from SCHINDLER'S LIST plays a woman whose father
was a policeman who committed suicide years earlier.  Milano could help
Det. Hobbes, but rightly fears getting involved.
     The beauty of the script can perhaps best be seen in the minutia.
The writer takes care in the fashioning of even the minor characters.
Det. Hobbes, for example, lives with his brother and his brother's son.
One morning at breakfast, his brother looks over and speaks a simple,
"I love you."  Imagine that, adult brothers who frankly admit their
love without it being some fake plot contrivance.
     Along the way, the clues mount as they do in any good mystery.
Among others, they include an ACLU video of Reese just before the
execution that contains a host of information to be uncovered and items
seemingly as simple as fingerprints.  When Det. Hobbes uncovers the
solution to the crimes, he ridicules it at first as preposterous.  As
Lt. Stanton explains it, "People want the world to make sense."
     In a nice surprise, the completely predictable ending isn't.  With
a few carefully chosen and completely satisfying twists, the movie's
ending is one of its best parts.
     FALLEN is rated R for some violence and profanity and would be
fine for teenagers.  A small part is in Aramaic without benefit of
English subtitles.

   Two cops discover a dead body in a bathtub. One says to
the other, "He had no friends and no family," to which the
other responds, "Then why is he dead?"  That modest gag
constitutes just about the only humor in "Fallen," a deadly
serious movie that combines the police and horror genres in a
complicated--some would say convoluted--plot that deals with
some mighty large philosophic issues.  Those metaphysical
concerns center on the nature of good and evil and even the
meaning of existence.  John Hobbes (Denzel Washington)
even asks his partner and fellow detective Jonesy (John
Goodman), "Why are we here?"  If that's not especially
original, it signals the film's lofty inquiry, not the sort of stuff
generally treated in a Hollywood studio movie.
   "Fallen" might easily be considered a parable of good and
evil, particularly the struggle each of us has with these two
qualities with which we'll born, assuming our name is not
Mother Teresa.  Those of us whose souls are heavy with
goodness will probably not succumb to greed; those infested
with evil will be wind up in jail or worse.  If "Fallen" were an
Everyman story, writer Nicholas Kazan (best known for his
script to "Reversal of Fortune") and director Gregory Hoblit
(formerly at the helm of "Primal Fear") are positioning
Detective Hobbes as a combination of good and evil
immersed in the struggle between the two, Gretta Milano
(Embeth Davidtz) as a professor of theology who is all-good;
and Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) as evil incarnate.
  Borrowing from such horror, police, and sci-fi thrillers as
"Seven," "The Exorcist" and "The X-Files," director Hoblit uses
Hobbes to narrate the tale, a story of the time, the cop tells
us, that he almost died; and is in effect a flashback to a
troubled time in a Pennsylvania police precinct.  In an over-
the-top prelude, Edgar Reese is about to be executed in the
gas chamber.  Agreeing to make a videotaped documentary
in which his arresting officer Hobbes meets with him hours
before, Reese extends his hand to Hobbes and mumbles
what appears to be gibberish but turns out to be a 2,000-year
old language combining Syrian with Aramaic.  He goes to his
death singing the Stones' "Time is On My Side," a song which
can be taken literally and which is sung by a number of
people throughout the two-hour film.  When other bodies are
found in bathtubs, Hobbes conducts an investigation which
leads him into the world of the occult, taking him to a cabin in
which a decorated officer apparently shot himself some thirty
years back and as well to that cop's daughter, Gretta (Embeth
Davidtz), who portentously warns Hobbes to walk away from
the case.
   "Fallen" features scenes in a police station and in Hobbes'
home that give us insight into the life of this obsessed man,
providing realistic dialogue among detectives and a touch of
sentimentality as we watch Hobbes' loving relationship with
his brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) and his cute nephew Sam
(MIchael J. Pagan).  
   Since "Fallen" is so derivative of similar movies, little occurs
that is unexpected.  Many moviegoers will predict the twist
that occurs near the conclusion and which seems to foretell at
least one sequel to the movie.  What makes the film
particularly worth watching is the magnetic presence of
Denzel Washington as a good guy who had recently given up
smoking (winning himself points in that eternal human
struggle between the forces of purity and wickedness) but
who replaces the weed with chewing gum (making him lose a
percentage of those points).  The picture, at two hours, is
longer than it should be, particularly since it is not freighted
with the twists and turns that keep an audience at the edge of
their seats.  On the whole it's too serious, even pompous, for
its own good.  The acting all-around is fine, with professional
performances by John Goodman and Donald Sutherland and
an authoritative turn by Embeth Davidtz as the somber
professor who is ironically too good to touch

     FALLEN proves that if you want to evoke millennial dread, you can't
just flirt with it -- you've got to embrace it.  The supernatural thriller
stars Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, a Philadelphia homicide detective
whose greatest success -- the capture and subsequent execution of serial
killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) -- is about to turn into his greatest
challenge.  It seems that a copycat is on the loose, committing murders
with Reese's m.o. and leaving teasing clues for Hobbes.  Is the new killer
a former accomplice of Reese?  Is a rogue cop involved?  Or is the truth
even more sinister, that the same dark spirit which drove Reese to kill
can migrate to other human hosts?
     Along to help answer those questions are John Goodman as Hobbes'
loyal partner, Donald Sutherland as his uptight lieutenant and Embeth
Davidtz as a theology professor.  All are talented performers who acquit
themselves admirably, but not not a one of them has much to work with in
Nicholas Kazan's script.  The dialogue is certainly effective,
particularly in its laconic familiarity of co-worker and familial
interaction.  The story simply doesn't create a single compelling
character to anchor the narrative.  That includes Hobbes, who remains a
vaguely heroic cipher despite the work of consummate professional
Washington.  In fact, the only real spark of personality comes from the
film's body-hopping villain, who occupies so many different characters
that he provides more of a menacing general presence than a specific
personality.
     Consequently, FALLEN becomes a thriller almost entirely of situation,
that situation being the threat of a malevolent eternal entity.  While
Gregory Hoblit puts together a few unique and creepy moments, including a
chase through a busy city street which becomes a psychic relay race, his
approach to the material is disappointingly conventional.  His tone is
that of a slightly-gloomier-than-average crime drama, with filtered
point-of-view shots used and over-used ass the only distinctive signal of
a demonic presence.  In short, it's just not all that disturbing, or even
particularly creative in its approach to the subject of demons walking
among us.  Isolated moments build effective tension, but Hoblit and Kazan
ultimately resort to the kind of obligatory "gotcha" climax which can
leave an audience with the faint aftertaste of cleverness despite a
general lack of substance.  Like Hoblit's PRIMAL FEAR, FALLEN is a
well-made and well-acted film which too often settles for the easy or
obvious way to handle a situation.  When that situation involves the
vengeful soul of an ageless fallen angel, you should hope for a bit more
than gunplay and the crooning of Rolling Stones tunes.

There are some concepts so deeply hard-wired into the human psyche that they
appear in nearly every culture on the planet. The horror of demons loose on
the earth wreaking havoc and spreading evil is one of these. Films that deal
with universal subjects have an advantage before they even begin: they have
already connected intimately.
Unfortunately "Fallen" doesn't go much further. It does feature an impressive
cast and some cool flash, but those searching for substance will go hungry.
Police Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) has finally caught the serial
killer he's been after and drops in on the execution to bring closure to that 
search. He stops by to visit the killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) before the
long walk and is greeted by the manic dancing man yelling at him in Aramaic,
an ancient language. Reese meets his doom singing the Stones' "Time is on my side".
Add as that is, Hobbes believes the string of killings is over. Then more
deaths crop up with exactly the same M.O. He and his partner Jonesy (John
Goodman) are mystified, especially so when the first murderer becomes the
second victim. Their superior Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland) suspects
a cop copy-cat killer.
Solving a riddle left at the scenes of the murders leads Hobbes to the case of
a detective who 30 years ago committed suicide when the department thought he
was dirty. This in turn sends him to Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz), the
policeman's daughter who is now a theology professor.
At first she is reluctant to tell him anything about her father's death. When
evidence mounts that Hobbes himself is the new killer, he goes on the run and
shows up at her apartment. She is then a bit more forthcoming.
When the fallen angels were cast out of heaven, their punishment was that they
became formless. Without a body of their own, they could possess a living
being, passing their essence from one to another effortlessly. Milano explains
the demon Azazel that her father battled is what Hobbes faces now. He left
Reese at the moment of death and is currently moving through the population of
the city.
Azazel enjoys playing with the detective. Possessing one after another of
Hobbes' fellow cops, the evil is passed along like a satanic game of tag.
"Time, time, time..." sings one to him. "...is on my side" chimes in the next.
"...Yes it is," finishes a third. The song is repeated effectively throughout
the film. He sees a young girl on the street and hears "Time, time, time..."
The film starts out with a promises, but they turn out to be mostly empty
ones. The death of Reese is well executed. High-contrast grainy film shows the
killers point of view as he sings and dances his way to the gas chamber. The
incident is unsettling and sets the stage for what turns out to be undelivered.
The plot plods along unremarkably to its "shock" ending that is telegraphed in
a major scene long before. You have to wonder how the highly intelligent
detective could be so un-thinking. While there are some impressive bits (the
chase as Azazel flows through a crowd of people is outstanding), the parts in
between these pull the movie down.
Washington is his usual cool self and never a disappointment. He's always
entertaining to watch, but whoever is responsible for deciding to use his
voice as a narrative made an error. The voice-over isn't interesting in tonal
quality and the words are just plain goofy.
Goodman is continuously a joy although in a minor role. His screen time could
have been increased to the benefit of the film. Koteas is also a lively addition.
Sutherland, a wonderful actor, is wasted in his role. Stanton is an
interesting guy and the audience keeps waiting for him to do something. He
never does. The character has no character.
The relationship between the cops rings true. Director Gregory Hoblit ("Primal
Fear" and Emmys for "Hill Street Blues", "LA Law" and "NYPD Blues") has it
down. Even the "Seven"-inspired scenes also work well. The primary problem is
that the entire film is a build-up to an ending that lets down.
Philosophically there's a difficulty. With all these fallen angels inhabiting
people and attempting to destroy mankind, who's around to battle them? A
couple of lowly humans? Where's the divine help? Are we to believe that
whoever's in charge tossed these almost all-powerful destructive fiends on
earth and told us to have a go at 'em. Scary thought.
"Fallen" is engaging enough to watch, but within a few days it'll fade from
your memory like most other could-have-beens. Maybe it should have been titled "Forgotten".
(Michael Redman has written this column for over 22 years and believes that,
while it makes for juicy gossip, the reality of Bill Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky's interaction is not much of our business and is probably just a
publicity stunt for "Wag The Dog". But then, he also believes that "Time,
time, time...is on our side.")

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Let's face it, any movie about a serial killer released in the next few
years is going to draw unfair comparisons to `Se7en'.  And why shouldn't
they?  It's only the Holy Grail of the genre.  Like `Silence of the
Lambs' was to the early 90's, `Se7en' will be to the late 90's and maybe
beyond.  Many movies strive to be as dark, unnerving and stylistic and
most fail.  With that said, `Fallen' is the closest thing I've seen so
far.
If you've seen the trailer, you get the basic story:  Detective John
Hobbes (Washington) is responsible for catching an evil serial killer
and is about to witness his execution.  As the killer dies, his soul
floats out of his body into an unsuspecting prison guard.  The trick is
that the soul can pass from person to person through any casual contact
(not unlike herpes). The `host' of the soul sings or hums or whistles
the Rolling Stones classic `Time Is On My Side', so that Hobbes (and the
slow viewer) can catch on that he's not really dead.
Hobbes gets no help from crusty Lieutenant Stanton (Sutherland) and
turns to Gretta Milano (Davidtz), the daughter of a suspiciously
deceased old cop, who turns him on to the biblical meaning of it all.
And wouldn't you know it, the more he finds out about this travelling
soul, the more he realizes that it will be impossible to stop it.  Duh!
The movie has a great look to it, mostly in part to Newton Thomas Sigel
(`The Usual Suspects').  It's dark and somewhat stylistic, but not quite
unnerving.  When you see through the eyes of the killer, everything gets
dark and discolored and warped (`Fincher-Vision'). And there's a very
impressive scene where the soul is chasing Milano down a busy sidewalk,
flinging itself from host to host in an attempt to catch her.
Washington plays Hobbes pretty much the same as his `Ricochet' cop
character.  John Goodman gets all of the good one liners (including my
revised tag line). Davidtz (Miss Honey in `Matilda') does what she can
with a pretty skimpy part.  Most of the best acting actually comes from
the people who briefly host the demon soul.  Their creepy grins and
singing are one of the really cool parts of this film.

USA. 1998. Director - Gregory Hoblit, Screenplay - Nicholas Kazan, 
Producers - Charles Roven & Dawn Steel, Photography - Newton Thomas 
Sigel, Music - Tan Dun, Visual Effects - Peerless Camera Co (Supervisor 
- Kent Houston), Special Effects Supervisor - James Fredburg, Production

(Art Hobbes), James Gandolfini (Lou), Robert Joy (Charles Olham)
Plot: Detective John Hobbes sees serial killer Edgar Reese to the gas 
chamber but not long after confronts a baffling series of murders which 
appear to also be being conducted by Reese. As Hobbes investigates it 
appears he is not dealing with a mere mortal but in fact a demon that is 
capable of passing between and possessing bodies simply by touch and 
that the demon has returned to taunt him and destroy his life.
Going in to see `Fallen', one doesn't really expect it to be much at 
all. The plot seems merely a warmed-over version of the mini-vogue of 
executed serial killers come back from the electric chair films that 
were briefly the in-thing around about 1988-9 - the likes of `Shocker', 
`The Horror Show' aka `House III', `The First Power', `Prison' and 
`Berserker' - only revamped with an A-budget. But in virtually no time 
at all `Fallen' proves that simply through good writing an old familiar 
plot can be made to work wonders once again. And the result is a 
surprisingly good film.
The film is made by Gregory Hoblit, previously a tv director who won 
Emmy Awards for his work on shows like `Hill St Blues' and `LA Law' and 
made the jump to feature films with the impressive 1996 courtroom drama 
`Primal Fear'. There is a surprising similarity of themes between 
`Primal Fear' and `Fallen' - `Primal Fear' you could say is a film about 
a killer who has one body but several personalities; `Fallen' on the 
other hand you could say is about a killer who has one personality but 
several bodies. Hoblit does a rather good job. The script is rather 
handicapped in that its central idea - that of a demon that can pass 
between bodies by touch - has been given away by the publicity machine. 
Nevertheless in spite of the fact that owing to this one knows what is 
going on for a good half-hour before the detective hero clicks on, both 
Hoblit and the script unfold these revelations with a high degree of 
tension and suspense. Hoblit generates some marvellous scenes with the 
demon passing from body to body amongst people at the police station and 
in the street, all the while taunting the hero. And there is beautifully 
written twist ending - the first one has ever seen which manages to so 
twist first-person voiceover completely on its head.
The film kept reminding of `Se7en' which seems to have been a strong 
influence. Both employ the same densely textural washed-out lighting 
scheme. And both are very similar films - about detectives who are 
confronting a Biblical menace (`Fallen' an actual demon, `Se7en' a 
serial killer using the motif of the Seven Deadly Sins) wherein the 
Biblically Apocalyptic is raised into a looming millenarian metaphor for 
moral social decay. Although where `Se7en''s moral metaphors were 
dazzlingly literary, `Fallen''s seem stuck down in the idiom of B horror 
movies. Both films also contain one really grisly scene where the film 
seems to hang still for a moment and toy with the audience as to whether 
it is really going to do the unthinkable and kill off one of the 
detective hero's loved one's. Neveretheless for its ability to move with 
tense and exciting grace and juggle a plot that keeps catching one 
perpetually unawares, `Fallen' is a film that is well above average and 
recommended.

Fallen is a crash of genres. It takes a detective/sleuth genre and smashes
it together with a thriller/supernatural genre. Typically, smashing genres
together, especially such different genres, doesn't work really well. How
well does it work with Fallen?
The movie starts off with the calm voice of Detective Hobbes (Denzel
Washington) recounting a story for us, "I want to tell you about the time I
almost died." And from here we are transported back in time to the start of
the events that Hobbes is referring to.
Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) is about to go to the gas chamber. But, before
he does, he gets a visit from the detective that caught him and sent him to
the chamber, Detective John Hobbes. As Reese is sent off to the gas
chamber, he starts to sing a song, that is used very well throughout the
film, "Time is on my side"
What happens next is the supernatural part, it seems that Reese was the
embodiment of a fallen angel, Azazel. Now that Reese has been gassed to
death, he's pretty angry and wants to get some payback. It seems that
Azazel travels from body to body via touch. Azazel doesn't want to kill
Hobbes right away, he wants to play with Hobbes and ruin his life first.
Hobbes is quickly alerted to Azazel's presence, by Azazel in different
people. But, Hobbes is confused to how -- as he believes -- Reese is doing
what he's doing, since he believes that Reese is dead. For Hobbes and his
partner Jonesy (John Goodman) the problem is to find out what is happening
and how it is happening. In his detective work, Hobbes runs into Gretta
Milano, the daughter of a cop who killed himself 30 some years ago. There
is a link between Milano's dad and what is happening to Hobbes. She tells
Hobbes about Azazel and helps him out.
Fallen is a well-written film by Nicolas Kazan. It does well with the
mixing of the genres and plays somewhat like a longer episode of The
known -- Primal Fear, does an excellent job of bringing the audience into
the film without a sudden onslaught of supernaturalism. Hoblit is able to
ease us slowly into the supernatural portion of the film because the script
has Hobbes as an unbeliever and the audience is slowly brought to the point
of suspension of disbelief as we follow Hobbes' own trip into the
supernatural. The film itself looks beautiful with its washed out colors
and high contrast cinematography. Kudos to cinematographer Tom Sigel. The
film looks almost like a David Fincher film -- it would have been fun to
see how the film would have turned out if Fincher had directed it.
Look for Elias Koteas' eerie performance as Reese early on in the film. He
is convincingly creepy as a serial killer taken over by a demon.
Washington, like always, is great onscreen. He has a commanding onscreen
presence. And though John Goodman has a supporting role, he takes the role
all the way and is a joy to see onscreen.
Worth mentioning is a chase sequence in the middle of the film between
Azazel and Gretta that is pretty exciting and will cause you to scoot to
the edge of your seat. This chase sequence is ingenious and if I say
anything more, it'll spoil the chase for you.
The end of the film has a big twist and for me it was a well-deserved
twist, but I'm afraid that it is so big that some audience members might be
disappointed. Kudos to Hoblit for keeping such a twist in the film.
The music by Tan Dun is strange, creepy, and works really well with the
film. The score is filled with high strings and is somewhat hard to
describe, but it does work really well.
The only thing that bothered me about the film was its running time. It
doesn't excessively run too long, but it does feel a bit on the long side.
The film could have benefited from a few cuts to tighten it up. But, this
is not a big deal.
Fallen works very well as a film that smashes two very different genres
together. The last film that did this was Devil's Advocate. Though Devil's
Advocate works a bit better than Fallen, Fallen is a great film to spend
two hours with. If you have time, catch Fallen in the theatres. If not,
catch it on video.

De Bijbel is ontzettend populair en een inspiratiebron voor veel mensen.
Vooral de mysterieuze en paranormale aspecten van dit boek interesseren
veel mensen. Daarom maken ook veel schrijvers gretig gebruik van dit
boek, zoals te zien is in "The Devil's Advocate", The Excorcist en
"Seven". Nu is er ook "Fallen", een horrorfilm waarin het kwaad vele
vormen aanneemt. En dan bedoel ik ook véle vormen. 
Het is John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) samen met z'n maat Jonesy (John
Goodman) eindelijk gelukt om Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) achter de
tralies te krijgen. Reese, een gestoorde seriemoordenaar, wordt zo snel
mogelijk in de gaskamer gezet om voor z'n daden te boeten. In de laatste
minuten van z'n leven prevelt hij opeens vreemde zinnen in oud-Aramees.
En dat is onmogelijk, want die taal is al duizenden jaren oud en wordt
nu alleen maar door een paar primitieve stammen gebruikt. 
Nadat Reese gestorven is, wilt Hobbes de draad van z'n leven weer
oppakken. Helaas imiteert iemand de stijl van Reese en er vallen dus
weer veel doden. Het valt Hobbes op dat de dader zinnen op de muur
schrijft die alleen begrijpelijk zijn voor Hobbes. Later komt hij
erachter dat het geen 'copycat' is, maar Reese zelf, die steeds andere
gedaanten aanneemt om zo ongemerkt te ontsnappen. 
Hobbes gaat op onderzoek uit en roept de hulp in van Gretta Milano, de
dochter van Lou Milano. Lou Milano was een politie-agent die met
dezelfde dingen te kampen had en al snel daarna zelfmoord pleegde.
Gretta Milano, een gelovige, legt aan hem uit dat er een gevallen engel
aan het werk is. Deze engel is Azazel, die wraak wilt nemen op Hobbes en
daarom hem, z'n vrienden en z'n familieleden teistert. Hobbes is hier
niet blij mee en gaat op jacht. Dit wordt nog erg moeilijk voor hem,
want door aanraking kan Azazel van gastlichaam verwisselen. 
"Fallen" ziet er visueel gezien prachtig uit en regisseur Gregory Hoblit
maakt, net als David Fincher bij "Seven", veel gebruik van regen en
donkere beelden om de film een realistisch tintje te geven. Helaas is
het verhaal, hoe boeiend het ook mag zijn, nogal ongeloofwaardig
uitgewerkt en er zitten ook een paar gaten in. Maar goed, dat mag de
pret niet drukken. Denzel Washington draagt een steentje bij aan de
kwaliteit en daardoor is "Fallen" nog een vermakelijke film geworden.

One thing I found disappointing in 1973's 'The Exorcist', is that
despite its tremendous entertainment value, it exploited the premise of
demonic possession without telling you much about it.  It made up for
this flaw by showcasing an absolutely blistering climax as two priests
try and rid Satan from the body of a little girl.  William Peter Blatty
did win an Oscar for his adapted screenplay, based on the book, so he
must have done something right.
'Fallen' has a similar problem but can't touch the classic stature of a
film like 'The Exorcist' by any stretch of the imagination.  It's
premise of soul transformation is an intriguing one but it has no line
of explaining the history or theological origins traced to the heart of
its story.
Denzel Washington is always impressive (has he ever made a truly awful
movie?)  All right, I'll give you 'Heart Condition' (1990) and maybe
'Ricochet' (1991) but the Oscar winning actor always finds the right
style even in films that are mediocre.
Washington stars as a California detective who pays a final visit to a
convicted felon he help capture (Elias Koteas) who is about to be
executed and deep down, Washington relishes the fact that the low life
is about to succumb to the lethal forces of the gas chamber and Koteas
tries to make final contact with Washington by attempting to shake hands
with him.
Upon execution, Koteas sings a familiar song just before which comes
back to haunt Washington later in the film along with other
characteristics of the criminal's behaviour.
Unusual occurrences begin to surface as a series of murders occur in the
city and Washington finds a familiar pattern to it all.  People begin
confronting him and sing the song that Koteas sang at his execution and
this drums up suspicions that the killer's soul is being transferred
into the bodies of innocent people.  It seems that the soul can change
bodies at will upon the act of a simple touch by one person to another
and the movie can't escape the fact that anything that routine is simply
not a believable premise for a movie.  The movie spends virtually its
entire first hour doing this and becomes tedious after the first 45
minutes.
Washington seeks advice from a theologian (Embeth Davidtz) and is
dealing with his partner (John Goodman) through all of this and the
skeptical tone of his boss (Donald Sutherland).  Goodman and Sutherland
are instrumental in the film's final resolution which the audience can
see coming a mile away.
Director Gregory Hoblit ('Primal Fear') uses repetitive pseudo slow
motion shots that stretch and skew across the movie screen in a deeply
coloured and grainy manner as a way of showing the perception of evil
and I found it to be a tiresome and gruesome trick that was over used
and reminiscent of a Brian DePalma film.
Writer Nicholas Kazan ('Reversal of Fortune'), has penned a shallow and
unimaginative film of wannabe gothic proportions and instead of coming
up with a story that should have characters we care about, it fails
because it doesn't showcase an acceptable form of depth and therefore
contains a story we ultimately care nothing about.

PLOT:
Prize cop is haunted by the soul of a murderer whom he helped capture. Even
after the execution of said killer, the spirit of the man returns in others,
and is passed around different bodies by the slightest touch.
CRITIQUE:
A fascinating and creepy premise, as well as an authentic performance by
Washington, and an inventive stylish look, wrestle this film from its "just
another serial killer" roots, and qualify it as an interesting, occasionally
suspenseful supernatural thriller. Some aspects of the film didn't work for
me, like Washington's home life, the way the killer kept leaving cryptic
clues which Washington always ended up finding and solving (how original!),
and the final, final scene, which seemed tacked on for obvious reasons. That
aside, the film kept me interested with its original tale of the Azazel
spirit switch, a little action, and some suspense. But I will admit that I
felt like they could've done so much more with the subject matter at hand.
Other than Washington, the cast were throwaways like Gandolfini in a
funny-looking fu-manchu mustache, Donald Sutherland playing yet another
authoritative gruffy ol' coot, and John Goodman stapling himself into his
mainstay role of the main cop's buddy partner. I also enjoyed the resolution
that Washington deduced by the film's slick conclusion. All in all, a decent
serial killer thriller that doesn't come close to the ultimate in the genre,
SEVEN (9.5/10), but does come up with an intriguing premise, a solid
performance from Washington, and just enough suspense to keep you on your
toes for its two hour runtime. Just remember..."Time is on your side". :)
Little known facts about the movie and its stars:
Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan is the son of infamous director Elia Kazan.

Seen on 31 January 1998 for $8 with Lynne and Sandy at the UA Continental
Twin in Forest Hills
*Fallen* is a bit of a cross between *The Prophecy* and *The Hidden*.
*Fallen* begins with Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) visiting
the death row cell of a vicious killer he was instrumental in snaring. The
killer is unusual--as if they weren't unusual already; he mutters
something incomprehensible, and definitely gives the impression that the
struggle is not over. Early on in the movie, we learn that Hobbes is an
honorable cop. He cannot be bribed, and he is devoted to his work and to
his family, which comprises a somewhat addled brother and young nephew. 
Soon after the prisoner meets his end in the gas chamber, copycat murders
occur that start to incriminate Hobbes himself. Some clues by the killer
and some independent research (the strange mutterings were ancient Syrian
Aramaic) lead Hobbes to realize that a similar string of killings
happened 30 years before to another honorable cop. A visit to the man's
grown-up daughter--Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz)--proves that something
weird and usual is afoot. 
It turns out that the killer is not a person but the spirit of an angry
angel named Azazel, a malevolent spirit thousands of years old who can
jump from being to being and that makes him/it very hard to find. 
Now, if you can go along with this premise, you are halfway to enjoying
this low-key thriller. That was my problem with the movie. It was pretty
slow-moving for a thriller, which is a shame since all the elements are
there for it to be a bit more, well, thrilling. In fact, my brother dozed
off more than once. 
*Fallen* clearly is influenced by the recent upswing in supernatural
thriller shows like *The X Files* and *Millenium*. Watching Washington
unravel the supernatural mystery while being stalked by a vengeful spirit
who can be anyplace is interesting, although sometimes finding information 
about Azazel is too convenient and less than credible. 
The best scenes in the movie is the one in which Azazel jumps from person
to person. One takes place right in the police precinct, and then out on
the street. The better one though is the one in which Azazel chases Gretta
when he figures out she knows about him. It is the only really
spine-tingling scene in the movie. *Fallen*'s premise requires a lot more
action than it delivers. 
Director Gregory Hoblit does a good job of keeping a creepy atmosphere
going, and picks some downright dingy neighborhoods of nighttime
Philadelphia to do this. Overall, the movie is a bit sluggish, though, and
it is hard not to see why, when you consider the story and the cast.
Denzel Washington plays his role low-key. His co-stars are John Goodman
(talk about sluggish) and Donald Sutherland, and the rest are not
particularly noteworthy or familiar. Lynne points out, "As always, Donald
Sutherland is a problem." And he is. His performance and role are the
most out of place. Hobbes is a star officer under his command; why he
chooses to put him down constantly is not explained, and doesn't fit with
the rest of the movie. 
So, *Fallen* is not a bad movie, but it really might not be worth $8. It's
a good bet for a video rental, though. Add a star if you really love the
lyric "ti-i-i-me is on my side, yes it is." You'll hear it throughout the
movie.

How's this for a plot:  cop stalks supernatural body-swapping entity.
No, it's not a remake of The First Power, but it is Fallen, an mostly
unsuccessful thriller whose good cast can't overcome a bad script.
Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) has finally reached closure
with one of his toughest cases.  Killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) is
finally being executed.  However, Reese doesn't seem too distraught at
the occurence, singing The Rolling Stones' Time is On My Side as he is
gassed.
Soon more killings occur throughout the city, each with the same set of
circumstances used by Reese.  More disturbingly, each victim seems to be
killed by a different murderer.  It's up to Detective Hobbes to stop the
slayings, but he doesn't suspect what has been unleashed.
A theology professor, Greta Milano (Embeth Davitz), is the first to
reveal to Hobbes that his foe is of supernatural origin.  The fallen
angel Azazel, who can possess bodies with a simple touch, is to blame.
For some (never explained) reason, Hobbes is unpossessable, and so
Azazel has selected him as a target.  But how can one stop a
supernatural being?
Washington is as good as always in the role of the tormented cop, but
there are too many scenes of him simply doing something, with the
narration taking over, explaining what he's doing.  A more confident
filmmaker would have shot the film without the narration (although it
does provide a non-crucial twist), relying on the talents of Washington
(or a better script) to convey the meaning of his actions.
Washington is surrounded by a good supporting cast, including his trusty
partner, Jonesy (John Goodman), his secretive Lieutenant, Stanton
(Donald Sutherland), the weaselly Lou (James Gandolfini), and the
aforementioned Gretta (Embeth Davitz). You know as the film goes on that
one (or more) of them will become hosts for Azazel.  However, they seem
to spend most of the film waiting for that moment to arrive, rather than
doing any particularly interesting things.
There are a few interesting concepts, and a couple of thrilling scenes
wherein the killer's rapid body switching creates some true paranoia.
However, one of the problems with creating a nearly all-powerful
supernatural foe is defining its limits, something that Fallen fails to
properly do.  When we finally learn of Azazel's true plans for revenge,
we wonder why it didn't just do that before.  The only thing which would
have stopped it was the script.
Fallen's quasi-religious themes don't ever quite play out.  There are
too many questions that go unanswered.  (Such as why Denzel can't be
possessed?  Or why this fallen angel acts more like a serial killer than
a supernatural force?) When the screenplay gets stuck, it smugly hides
behind a "there are some things we aren't meant to know".  One or two of
those might have been acceptable...but when the film is filled with
them, you're left to wonder, what's the point?

Anyone up for a nice game of demonic tag? In the supernatural thriller 
"Fallen," the demon Azazel can transfer from body to body by mere touch. 
It happens instantaneously, so quickly that the next party doesn't even 
have time to react. There's a great scene in the film where Detective 
John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) finally realizes the truth about the 
creature when it follows him down a crowded street, transferring from 
body to body with remarkable ease while taunting the terrified officer. 
Director Gregory Hoblit exhibits perfect timing in this nifty scene, his 
camera flowing smoothly from actor to actor as Azazel body-hops. It's 
words and expressions seamlessly transfer from one person to the next, 
and the effect is dazzling and truly creepy. Ah, if only Hoblit could 
have maintained this level of tension for the whole film. 
He didn't, of course, which is why "Fallen" has been released in January, 
a month designated by the studios for dumping those films that couldn't 
cut it during the highly competitive holiday season. It's a shame, 
because "Fallen" had real potential.
The idea is nothing new. The stylish sci-fi thriller "The Hidden" focused 
on a hedonistic alien murderer that moved from one human host to another 
and the central storyline of David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" involved the 
demon BoB, who killed Laura Palmer while inhabiting her father's body. In 
those stories though, the transfer was traumatic, to say the least. The 
ingenious twist of "Fallen" was in making the transfer instantaneous and 
painless. When the demon moves on, the previous host has no memory of 
what just happened, making the procedure all the more insidious. How does 
a detective follow an investigation when the body that did the killing 
may actually be innocent? Unfortunately, "Fallen" only toys with the 
notion, rather than diving in completely.
The story begins as Hobbes attends the execution of his nemesis, serial 
killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in a brief, but electric performance.) 
Hours before his death, Reese requests, and receives a visit from Hobbes. 
In one of the film's best scenes, Reese moves about his cell like an 
animal, grinning maniacally at Hobbes while tossing off lines like "What 
goes around really goes around" between explosive bursts of a language 
not used since Biblical times. In the gas chamber, Reese continues 
grinning, singing "Time Is On My Side" right up until the end. 
Immediately following his demise, the camera moves to a point of view 
shot above the body, providing a hint of things to come.
In short order, Hobbes learns that something very weird is up, as the 
streak of murders begins again. His investigation leads him to 
supernatural notions he cannot begin to accept and to theology student 
Gretta Limano (Embeth Davidtz,) the daughter of an officer who was killed 
by Azazel. 
All the elements for a successful thriller are present in "Fallen," yet 
the film never quite catches fire. A large part of the problem lies in 
Denzel Washington's performance. Washington is a charismatic actor, but 
generally behaves like a Scoutmaster with a broomstick jammed up his ass. 
He is at his best in films such as the charming "The Mighty Quinn," where 
his stiffness was incorporated into the story. Here, his behavior simply 
appears too proper and subdued for the situation. His muted reactions to 
the incredible circumstances around him puts a damper on audience 
reaction as well. 
There's also the matter of Reese. When Hobbes learns the truth about 
Azazel, he surely would realize that, as one of Azazel's host bodies, 
Reese may have actually been just another victim of the demon. It would 
have been nice to see Hobbes give at least a moments thought to the 
notion that he might have sent an innocent man to his death, but it never 
happens.
Instead, the sole focus of the film is the cat and mouse game between the 
demon and the cop, while the supporting cast twiddle their thumbs. John 
Goodman is wasted as Hobbes partner, Donald Sutherland does his usual 
sinister shtick as the commanding officer, and Embeth Davidtz just rushes 
about looking grim. A promising subplot involving Hobbes live-in brother 
and nephew is never explored.
We do, however, get lots of footage of a dreary Philadelphia and an 
annoying voice-over from Denzel Washington that drips with clichés. Now 
don't get me wrong, "Fallen" isn't a terrible film. There's a genuinely 
intriguing idea at play here, and in a few scenes, the premise comes 
alive, showing just how juicy the film might have been. Had the 
filmmakers taken a little more time to think the story through and flesh 
out the supporting cast, "Fallen" could have been a real corker instead 
of just another January throw-away.

FALLEN
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
As the film opens, Philadelphia homicide detective John Hobbes (Washington) is 
attending the execution of Edgar Reese ("Crash"'s Elias Koteas), a serial killer 
whom he apprehended single-handed. What Hobbes doesn't know is that his 
adversary's murderous motivation has been supplied by the dark, fallen seraph 
that's inhabited his body, making Reese not your typical psychopath. This 
diabolical entity -- called Azazel -- is transferred through human hosts by 
touch, and targets Hobbes as an eventual victim. But Hobbes fights back with the 
help of a pretty theologian (Embeth Davidtz) who's actually related deeper to 
the case than she'd like to admit. Also on hand to cast interdepartmental doubt 
on Hobbes' seemingly out-there actions are his loyal partner (John Goodman) and 
suspicious lieutenant (Donald Sutherland). 
It takes a good while for "Fallen" to get moving, but when it does, things 
become quite intriguing. The film, which plays like an occasionally spooky mesh 
of "Seven" and "The Exorcist," boasts an exciting gimmick -- how Azazel can be 
transferred into just about anyone -- that leads to a handful of exciting 
sequences where Washington must cast distrustful eyes on every person in his 
surroundings. Although "Fallen" might leave you with a detached feeling, it's 
hard to not be engrossed with the story's unfolding details. What keeps the 
movie from being solid entertainment, however, is that too much of it remains 
frustratingly ambiguous, like the interaction between Hobbes and his brother and 
nephew. And "Fallen"'s alleged "surprise ending" -- a denouement that Warner 
Bros. issued requests asking the press to not spoil -- should shock no one who 
has been watching attentively. 
Washington is his usual sunny, likeable self, which contrasts nicely with the 
movie's cold, grim atmosphere. Other cast members are solid without being used 
terribly well; Davidtz ("Schindler's List"), for example, creates the beginnings 
of an interesting character, but later comes off like walking, talking 
exposition. Still, even if the good guys are an underdeveloped crew, the film 
does manage to make Azazel menacing without the use of a constant actor or even 
special effects aside from some periodic weird point-of-view shots. But "Fallen" 
is nonetheless an uneven film. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of 
Fortune") has traces of a true, terrifying tale in "Fallen" -- what could have 
possibly kept his script so lopsided? Could it be ... Satan?

Some angels that are cast out of Heaven come down to Earth to inhabit
unsuspecting souls.  People just like you and me can become unwilling
hosts to these impish beings that now exist for no other reason than
to torment and spread evil.  This is the seemingly far-fetched
explanation offered to Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) who
is in the course of investigating a series of murders and strange
occurrences.  
Hobbes becomes embroiled in this case shortly after Edgar Reese (Elias
Koteas), a convicted killer that he was responsible for apprehending,
was put to death.  After Reese's execution, however, more murders
patterned after Reese's style begin to occur. Mysterious, late-night
phone calls taunt Hobbes and clues are left at the murder scenes
daring Hobbes to comprehend what's really going on.  Is it a case of a
delusional, copycat murderer on the loose?  Or is there a more
sinister entity at work here? 
"Fallen" ultimately takes on the form of a film noir with supernatural
elements that pits a good-natured detective against an evil presence,
known as Azazel.  The movie offers us some interesting moments.
Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy (John Goodman), reflect solemnly on the
purpose of enforcing goodness knowing how strong evil is.  We learn
that Azazel is a force that can move from one host body to another
through touch.  At one point, on a busy, city street, pedestrians are
quickly touching each other, as Azazel transports from one body to
another as it pursues its next victim.  And, there is a interesting
subplot that revolves around a cop who experienced Hobbes' situation
30 years ago.  As Hobbes learns more and more about the omnipotence of
his evil-spirit opponent, a sense of combustibility begins to become
more and more prevalent.
However, this movie teases us but never quite takes us past the
Imagination Threshold (a point that moviegoers must pass in order to
embrace such fantastical elements in this kind of film).   Hobbes is
the kind of honest cop that can only exist in a movie - never
accepting a bribe, professing to do everything under a code of honor,
adhering to the laws that are in place.  Denzel Washington seems like
an odd choice, with his soft demeanor and good looks.  He never seems
to really internalize the bizarre situation at hand.  Jonesy doesn't
add any spice to the movie's cast of characters and seems much too
heavy to be an effective detective.  And Donald Sutherland, playing
the police department's lieutenant, is reduced to beady-eyed stares as
he tries to monitor the progress of the investigation.  His role is
essentially wasted.  
If this film was trying to adhere to the conventional parameters of a
police thriller, it failed to engage us in the plight of Hobbes, even
as Azazel continued to torment him.  As a piece of film noir, however,
it still faltered because the cast seemed completely out of their
element.  What this film lacked, oddly enough, was spirit.

Rated R: violence, language
by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
    I've got to give the makers of Fallen credit for trying something
high-minded and going through with it for the most part. The film is
composed of appealing ideas and characters, and often times it even
works, but after hearing about this story, I would have handled the
execution completely differently. This could have been a deeply
disturbing film, moving and profound on multiple levels. Too bad,
because it waters down its own dark themes, and shifts with unnatural
tonal changes. The result is an original, well-acted film that tiptoes
around greatness and ends up falling far short of the mark.
    Denzel Washington stars as John Hobbes, the New York detective who
narrates the story. In the beginning, we find that he has just put away
serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas in a brief but energetic
performance). It doesn't take long for Hobbes to find out that the
spirit of the killer is being passed around from body to body by means
of touch--in one frantic sequence, he watches on the street as each
passerby stares him in the eye with a demonic grin. He enlists the help
of theologian Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz); as it turns out, her
father went through the exact same situation that Hobbes is going
through at the time of the film.
    Fallen is a strange case. I immediately knew there was something
wrong when the lively '60s tune Time is on My Side (I think that's what
it's called...) began blaring during the credits. Credits, for me, set
the tone of the film, and this is not what I'd expect from a film called
Fallen about serial killers and spirits gone awry. This isn't a severe
misstep, however--the narration is a far bigger problem. Washington is a
terrific actor, and this is a great performance, but his voice is just
not good for narration. He sounds too happy, too nice for it to be a
foreboding element. It's not really comical, but with his voice in there
all along, there isn't really any doubt that he's going to be okay. In
that case, a central element of suspense in the film is lost.
    This leads right into another striking problem with the film--it
isn't scary enough. This is a story that sent a tingle down my spine
when I saw the preview. The ideas here have so much promise--just the
thought of a killer who can pass from person to person so easily is
utterly unnerving. The execution, though, could have been so much more
eerie. It's creepy just in nature, but it could have been downright out
of control. The director, Gregory Hoblit, is not entirely to blame for
this: I think the fatal error here is the fact that the audience knows
what's going on far too early--this is dramatic irony at its most
extreme. We get to find out what's going on just from seeing the
trailer, but Hobbes doesn't get in on the secret until halfway through
the film.
    With the central idea behind the film let out so early, it's truly
hard to be afraid of it. Another big mistake is the usage of
first-person from the eyes of the spirit. There is something about
seeing what it sees that totally eliminates all suspense from the
situation. There is one truly breathtaking moment, involving the
basement of a lonely cabin and a lot of spider webs, but most of the
film lacks this kind of intense uncertainty.
    Still, there is a lot to like about this film. The performances, for
one, are all great. Washington is always convincing as the cop who is
seemingly at the center of this supernatural joke. John Goodman, who
plays Hobbes' partner, manages to create an interesting character in the
limited screen time he's given, and Donald Sutherland is good as always
as Hobbes' boss. I also liked Davidtz--she displayed the same kind of
strength that she did as Helen Hirsch in Schindler's List.
    It's a decent film, but you'll know when you watch it that it's been
tested and toned down from what it was originally supposed to be. The
ending, too, feels like a major cheat. The ideas behind this film are
superb--highly imaginative and ultimately convincing. As far as the
execution is from what I wanted, the film still engaged me. I liked the
characters enough, and the situation is extremely interesting.
    It's pretty rare that films take on this religious, demonic tone.
Last year I went into The Devil's Advocate not expecting much, and I got
a forceful, extremely moving and often disturbing picture. Fallen
promises as much but didn't deliver--this film should have been directed
by David Fincher. Had it been darker and more ominous, Fallen would have
been a truly great film. It takes the easier path, though, and ends up
just making you wish that someone in the production had thought that we
could have handled something more hard-hitting.

 `Fallen' is what's known as a supernatural thriller. That means that the bad
 guy is a ghost or a demon or something weird like that. The question is in
 these things, who do you want to win? The insufferable good guy who is morally
 pure or the demon/ghost/devil?
 The i.g.g is John Hobbes(Denzel Washington), a heroic cop, who when we meet
 him, is at a state prison to witness the execution of Edgar Reese(Elias
 Koteas), a serial killer[serial killers are tres chic, you know] who's been
 taunting  Hobbs for years.
 We soon learn that  Hobbs lives with his extraordinarily wimpy brother Art
 (Gabriel Casseus) and Art's son Sam (Michael J. Pagan) and that because of
 this his girlfriend had moved out. Guess who's going to get it...
 But this is a supernatural thriller and Reese isn't just Reese. He's also
 Azazel, Satan's left hand man, who can possess innocent people and other
 mammals and can move from one to the other by touching them. A nifty gimmick
 that while giving a lot of actors work, begins to grate on one after a while. 
 This version of `the wave' isn't  quite as fun as those at baseball games
 because, unfortunately, most of the film is a sophomoric rehash of every other
 supernatural thriller made over the past twenty years.
 Most of the cast is okay. John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini
 are good as Hobbs' fellow clueless colleagues, Embeth Davidtz overacts as the
 theologian daughter of a cop Azazel has played around with thirty years before
 and who gives some vital clues, and Robert Joy has a good time as Azazel's new
 temporary digs.
 But the film takes itself too seriously, and the use of narration and the
 ending are both cheats.

Synopsis: 
Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) gets more than he bargained
for when his opponent is not a serial killer but the demon Azazel. When
a person who is possessed by Azazel touches another person, Azazel can
transfer from one person to another, making the demon nearly impossible
to catch. Similarly, if a person who is possessed by Azazel gets killed,
Azazel can jump into the body of a new host, provided the new host is
within a distance of about a sixth of a mile. 
Unfortunately, the demon Azazel carries a grudge against Hobbes for
killing his last host (a psycho killer), and wants to make Hobbes' life
miserable by framing him for murder and possessing Hobbes' loved ones.
Hobbes teams up with lady theologist Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) in
order to get some clues about how to stop Azazel for the final battle.
In the middle of the film, Hobbes is nearly flattened in the basement of
an abandoned forest cabin by some objects caving in. In the end Hobbes
uses this abandoned cabin as the setting for his battle with Azazel.
Opinion:
Denzel makes a sparking detective - - I would love to see him in another
detective movie. And John Goodman is good as Detective Hobbes' partner.
The beginning starts off crisp as the two cops search around for clues,
but the movie becomes about a half an hour too long as they keep
searching and searching and searching ad infinitum. Then the movie
changes pace and tosses in a quick, unpredictable surprise ending - -
but an ending that I think will be disappointing to audiences (I won't
reveal it, in case you see the movie). 
To make this movie better, if I were in charge, I'd chop off a half hour
of extraneous sleuthing and get to the battle right away. I'd also make
a gutsier relationship with Gretta (kissing allowed) and use the
'cave-in' as foreshadowing for a better ending - - where the bad guy
should seem to win initially, but die by accident in a sudden cave-in
when he slinks into the basement of the cabin.

     Denzel Washington stars in this run-of-the-mill religious thriller,
as a Philly police detective stalked by the spirit of a serial killer
that he once put away and who was only recently executed.  The catch?
Well, there are a couple:  Casper the Unfriendly Ghost can occupy almost
any ol' human host *and* he can pass himself from one person to the
next, simply by touch.  Now, although our hero doesn't catch on for at
least an hour, *we* are shown the whole possession process from the get-
go.  And that's a grave mistake, 'cause it leaves the story with nowhere
else to go.  A better script, I suppose, would kick right into over-
drive, aiming for the sort of over-the-top territory that THE DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE did so well.  Or, maybe, it would go in the other direction,
descending into, say, a clever character study or detailed police pro-
cedural.  Alas, what Nicholas Kazan's screenplay *does* do is just
schlepp along, with a little bit of mystery here, a little bit of sus-
pense there, and a whole lot of missed opportunities everywhere else.

Supernatural films all have the same problem, that of making the
story seem reasonable.  That is quite a challenge.  Unfortunately,
about the only thing that would make an audience believe FALLEN is
that the personable Denzel Washington is the star.    He is
Detective John Hobbes in an unnamed city (but filmed in
Philadelphia.)
Detective Hobbes had witnessed the execution of killer Edgar Reese
(Elias Koteas). It is odd that the ever-observant detective (as he
himself tells us in a voice over) did not think it strange that
Reese seemed to take the impending execution very calmly, even
singing "Time Is On My Side" as he is about to be gassed.
 Shortly thereafter there occurs a series of murders which although
having all the earmarks of Reese's style, are nevertheless the
apparent work of other killers.  It is Hobbes' assignment to find
out what is happening and to put an end to it.   Easier said than
done as Hobbes ponders whether these are copycat murderers or
perhaps something more strange.   To help him, he seeks the advice
of Greta Milano (Embeth Davitz) who is a professor of theology, well
versed in the supernatural. It is she who tells Hobbes that he is
dealing with Azazel, an angel who has fallen from grace but who has
the ability by a mere touch to invade a person's body.   In fact we
see him walking along the street, touching people apparently at
random as he moves from one human to another..   While it is shown
that Azazel is out to get Hobbes, we are never quite told why Hobbes
himself appears to be immune to invasion of his body.
The film's ending does provide some surprises but by that time it is
too late to be saved.
 The supporting cast helps the film but only to a degree.   Jonesy
(John Goodman) is Hobbes' partner.  Donald Sutherland is Lieutenant
Stanton in the police department. Lou (James Gandolfini) is the
sneaky-looking detective.  But all are to no avail.

"You know, I haven't the least idea what he means, unless it could be that
he simply means what he says." [Aus, p.232]
Wir können /Fallen/ sehen und uns über die religiöse symbolik ärgern.
Wieder einmal ein film, der die biblischen erzählungen benützt um eine
schwache geschichte aufzuladen. Oder wir können uns von einer
detektivgeschichte unterhalten lassen, in der eine religiöse weltordnung
nur als austauschbarer hintergrund dient. Doch was könnte austauschbarkeit
hier heißen? Könnten die religiösen mächte des films einfach durch
beliebige übernatürliche kräfte ersetzt werden?
Klar ist, dass der film in einen kulturellen hintergrund eingebettet ist,
der die austauschbarkeit beschränkt. So wundern wir uns nicht, wenn die
symbolik biblisch ist, da der film aus den U.S.A. stammt.
Eine weitere reaktion wäre, sich von der religion im film nicht weiter
stören zu lassen. Immerhin zeigt uns /Fallen/ religiöse kräfte, von denen
nach offiziellen statistiken 85 prozent der bewohner nordamerikas und
europas glauben, dass sie existieren. So gesehen, müsste das wohl die
häufigste reaktion sein. Das macht es interessant, die geschichte ernst zu
nehmen, und zu untersuchen, wie diese glaubensinhalte im film dargestellt
werden. Mit ernst nehmen meine ich, sich der psychoanalytischen
konditionierung widersetzen und die zeichen nicht als indirekte, sondern
als direkte vertreter der dinge lesen.
Die hauptfigur in /Fallen/ ist der im dritten buch von Mose (Levitikus
16,8) erwähnte Azazel. Er wird als wüstendämon beschrieben, dem im ritual
von Yom Kippur derjenige ziegenbock geopfert wird, der später als
/sündenbock/ berühmt werden sollte. Im diesem ritual wird jedoch nicht nur
der sündenbock geopfert. Ein zweiter bock ist als opfer für Jahwe bestimmt.
Bemerkenswert ist dabei, dass der "für den Herrn" bestimmte ziegenbock
stirbt, während der für Azazel freigelassen wird, um, mit allen sünden der
juden beladen, in die wüste zu laufen. Dieser sündentransport erklärt im
Deutschen seine bezeichnung als sündenbock. Dass er Jahwe entkommt, führt
zu seinem namen im Englischen: scapegoat - the goat that escapes. Azazels
name selbst könnte von Hebräisch 'ez 'ozel stammen, das "bock der weggeht"
bedeutet. "Scapegoat" könnte demnach als ein versuch, Azazels name zu
übersetzen, verstanden werden.
Manche meinen auch zu wissen, dass Azazel selber die gestalt eines
ziegenbocks hatte. Das wäre durch den film erklärbar, in dem der dämon nur
kurze zeit in rein geistiger form überleben kann und dann wieder von
lebendigen körpern besitz ergreifen muss. Allerdings wäre es dann ein
leichtes ihn zu töten: einfach keine böcke mehr in die wüste schicken. Und
das ist auch die idee, auf die John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) und Gretta
Milano (Embeth Davidtz) kommen.
Nun gibt es Azazel natürlich nur, weil an ihn geglaubt wird und ihm böcke
geschickt werden. Das fatale ist aber, dass sich einerseits die spielregeln
nicht auf einer individüllen ebene festlegen lassen, und das es, was noch
schlimmer ist, regeln zu geben scheint, von denen niemand etwas weiss.
Diese geheimen regeln führen dann auch zu einem überraschenden und etwas
unbefriedigendem ende. Die dedektivische arbeit des polizisten Hobbes, an
der die erzählung des filmes festgemacht ist, besteht nämlich darin,
herauszufinden, wie das zürst unbekannte funktioniert.
Dabei erfahren wir von der theologin Gretta Milano, dass es ratsam ware,
sich vom unbekannten verursacher der ereignisse fernzuhalten, nicht
nachzufragen, seinen namen nicht auszusprechen. Sie präsentiert uns damit
ein wesentliches prinzip des religiösen: die ansteckende übertragung.
Die welt wird von religionisten bekanntlich in die zwei bereiche des
heiligen und des profanen geteilt. Zwischen diesen beiden bereichen liegt
ein abgrund. Es darf zu keiner berührung kommen, da sich einerseits das
heilige durch die geringste berührung von gegenstand zu gegenstand
überträgt, andererseits das profane das heilige in die gefahr der
entweihung bringt. Beide bereiche müssen daher streng auseinandergehalten
werden.
John Hobbes antwortet auf die frage ob er religös sei, dass er zwar ab und
zu in die kirche gehe, dass das aber als polizist etwas schwierig sei. Es
ist nicht nur schwierig, weil er so viel böses in seiner täglichen arbeit
sieht. Es ist schwierig, da die welt der polizei dem bereich des profanen
angehört. Dem entsprechend versucht die jungfrau Gretta Milano, sich von
ihm fernzuhalten. Er würde ihre heilige reinheit gefährden, die sie
versucht zu bewahren bis der entscheidende moment eintritt.
Damit wird ein zweites grundlegendes prinzip eingeführt: die teilung der
religiösen kräfte in reine und unreine. Diese zwei arten des religösen
stehen ebenfalls in einem durch verbote aufrecht erhaltenen gegensatz,
durch den sich Gretta Milano zu retten versucht. Sie muss sich nicht nur
vom profanen fernhalten, sondern auch von den unreinen und bösen kräften.
Eine minimale voraussetzung dafür ist natürlich, auf sex zu verzichten.
Azazel gehört als dämon zu der unreinen variante des heiligen. Dämonen sind
als böse geister verwandte der guten geister, den engeln. Die katholiken
glauben, dass Satan und die übrigen dämonen engel waren, die "sich aus
freiem willen weigerten, Gott und seinem ratschluss zu dienen". [Kat,
p.136] Augustinus meint, dass engel die beamten unter den geistern sind.
Beide arten von geistern sind der seele nachgebildet, die einem
materiehaufen diejenige form gibt, die ihn zu einem menschen macht. Geister
wären also so etwas wie eine reine form und so gesehen ist Azazel, als eine
variante von geist, die nicht als reine form existieren kann, eine
sympathische idee. Als haupt- und identifikationsfigur des films muss er
das wohl auch sein. Hier scheint auch der grösste und interessanteste bruch
mit der christlichen ideologie zu liegen, die der film aufweist. Eine
zusätzliche kleinere verschiebung ist die indirekte betonung der jüdischen
tradition.
Dem reinen heiligen, wie es uns in der gestalt von engeln und der
entsagenden frau entgegentritt, steht auf mehrere weisen John Hobbes
gegenüber. Er ist nicht nur polizist und damit profan, sondern auch schwarz
und damit unrein. Es kommt, dieser logik folgend richtigerweise, zu keiner
sexuellen beziehung zwischen der weißen theologin und dem schwarzen
polizisten.
Dieses ausbleiben des erwarteten verweist auch auf eine andere rolle, die
Denzel Washington im film The Pelican Brief spielte. Dort wurde John
Grishams buch extra umgeschrieben, damit es, dem rassenverbot Hollywoods
entsprechend, nicht zu sex zwischen Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) und
Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) kommt. Das erstaunlichste daran ist, wie plump
dies noch 1993 geschieht. Denzel Washington scheint in seinen rollen noch
hinter die integrationistische funktion Sidney Poitiers in den frühen 60er
jahren zurückzufallen.
In Heart Condition (1990) hat die von Washington gespielte figur zwar sex
und sogar ein kind mit einer weißen frau, die ist aber prostituierte und
außerdem kostet ihm das natürlich das leben. Worauf er den grössten teil
des filmes als geist (!) durch die gegend läuft.
In /Fallen/ umarmen sich Gretta Milano und John Hobbes, bevor letzterer
sich in dem kampf mit Azazel begibt. Diese berührung des profanen mit dem
reinen heiligen schwächt Hobbes, der bis dahin immun gegen die heilige
ansteckungskraft Azazels war, und bereitet ihn als opfer für das unreine
heilige vor. Die berührungsverbote, die bereiche des heiligen und profanen
getrennt halten sollen, werden in den berührungsverboten zwischen den
rassen gespiegelt.
In einer überraschenden wendung wird John Hobbes schließlich sogar als
erzähler der geschichte mit Azazel identifiziert. Obwohl Hobbes körper erst
am ende von Azazel befallen wird, hat er schon den ganzen film hindurch mit
seiner stimme gesprochen.

How does one catch a serial killer that is able to possess and transfer
itself from one human host to the next? I'm referring to evil spirits,
also known as fallen angels. In particular one called Azazel, a close
relative of Beezelbub who did so much body hopping during the movie it
gave me a blooming headache!
This movie presumes that serial killers are the way they are because of
possession by evil spirits. These spirits are supposedly able to take
complete control of man, causing them to do wicked things. Can you
imagine the legalities in the law court  Sorry Your Honour, I didn't
mean to murder the boss, my brother, the school teacher or his lover.
It's just that an evil spirit called Azazel made me do it.' Even if evil
spirits did exist, this version is totally unbiblical  taking away any
human responsibility for murder and making it in to some fancy Hollywood
concept for cheap thrills. I don't buy it.
This movie is a poor choice for Denzel Washington, a fine actor and
regular Church-goer. I find it surprising that he would condone such
nonsense  not the fact that spirits exist, but the fact they go body
hopping at a whim, causing good people to do evil things. John Goodman
is a steady co-star in any movie and helps lend a hand to deliver a slow
and thoughtless script. FALLEN is so full of superstitious mumbo-jumbo
that the words Acracadabra' and Open Sesame' should have been regular
quotes. It is a relief to see that Donald Sutherland doesn't play
another sinister bad guy, one of his more recent entrapments.
I have little else pleasant to say about this way over the top rendition
of an over regurgitated serial killer franchise.
