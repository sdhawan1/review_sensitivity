The Real Blonde (R) 1/2* (out of ****)
        A woman's face, an arm, some pumped-up pectorals, blond hair, a man's sad
face, slender legs, a random hand here and there.  As the opening credits
of Tom DiCillo's The Real Blonde unfold, these scattered, fractured
glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad
man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman, his head concealing her
unclothed breasts.  If only the rest of this formless, aimless ensemble
comedy assembled so coherently.
        Joe (Matthew Modine) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs
in commercials or soap operas.  He's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his
relationship with his live-in love, Mary (Catherine Keener), who holds some
subconscious hostility toward the male gender.  Mary, a makeup artist,
regularly works on model Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), who is obsessed with
the underlying messages in Disney's The Little Mermaid.  The bottle blonde
has a turbulent on-again, off-again relationship with Bob (Maxwell
Caulfield), a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde, which
he finds in co-star Kelly (Daryl Hannah).  As the film unspools, a variety
of other characters pass through: fashion photographer Blair (Marlo
Thomas); Mary's shrink (Buck Henry) and self-defense instructor (Denis
Leary); Joe's casting agent (Kathleen Turner) and hardass boss (Christopher
Lloyd); and a mystery woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who keeps on crossing Joe's
path.
        Where exactly does all this go?  That's a question best posed to
writer-director DiCillo, who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue
himself.  His meandering, largely unfunny script and direction are like
hopelessly lost drivers, turning into dead-end narrative streets only to
reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac.  And another.  And
another.  At one point Bob, frustrated with the soap scripts, complains to
the head writer (Jim Fyfe) that his and Kelly's characters keep on going in
circles, with no hint of development or growth.  That is most certainly the
case here.  Joe gets a job and ultimately botches things; he and Mary
bicker; they make up, only to have the pattern repeat itself.  Unhappy with
his bottle blonde, Bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied; he returns
to the faux and is still unsatisfied.  If there is a point to all of this,
DiCillo dances around it, spending his time on apparent digressions that,
as it turns out, aren't digressions at all.
        The Real Blonde is not without some amusements.   It does have the
occasional funny line and situation; Leary, Henry, Lloyd, Steve Buscemi,
and Dave Chappelle shine in their small roles; Keener is a likable,
refreshingly earthy lead; Berkley's appearance is mercifully brief (she
receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute
role); and there is the irony of having Caulfield play a wildly popular
soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket (last year, the actor was fired
from the daytime drama All My Children after a scant six months--due to
lack of viewer interest).  But on the whole, The Real Blonde is a
frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be
glossy on the surface, but there's nothing going on inside.  (opens

THE REAL BLONDE
Directed by Tom DiCillo
 Early on, it appears "The Real Blonde" might be out to do for struggling
thirtysomething white actors what Robert Townsend's uproarious "Hollywood
Shuffle" (1987) did for struggling twentysomething African-American actors,
namely to use the humiliations they must endure to find work as the
springboard for rich satire. Joe (Matthew Modine) is 35, good-looking and
talented, but he still has no agent, no substantial credits and no idea of
how to talk to casting agents. Hint: Telling them you won't even consider
doing a soap opera because "that's not real acting" is usually a one-way
ticket straight to the exit door. Joe's lofty ideals begin to deflate when
his friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) gets a long-term gig on the daytime drama
"Passion Crest" at a staggering $3600 a week, and it isn't long before Joe
is all but begging to be a beach-boy extra in a Madonna video.
 Writer-director Tom DiCillo has a lot more on his mind than Joe's
employment problems, however. DiCillo also wants to explore Bob's carnal
quest to find one real blonde, which involves sleeping his way through a
series of chemically altered models. DiCillo is also intrigued by Joe's
girlfriend Mary (Catherine Keener), a hairdresser with an enormous amount of
pent-up rage stemming from the constant sexual harrassment she's subjected
to on the streets of New York. And just to make sure his movie has enough
plot, DiCillo also throws in the plight of a neighborhood woman who's lost
her dog, the trampy behavior of an egotistical actress (Daryl Hannah) who
becomes Bob's co-star on the set and in the bedroom, a self-defense
instructor (Denis Leary) who tries to put the moves on Mary, a troubled
model (Bridgette Wilson) who claims to find spiritual enlightenment in "The
Little Mermaid," and a Madonna body double (Elizabeth Berkley) who's weary
of having hair the color of buttered popcorn.
 Soon "The Real Blonde" starts to seem more like an extended episode of "The
Real World," as we're asked to care deeply about the woes, jealousies,
inhibitions and fantasies of some fairly shallow people. A few funny lines
pop up along the way and give DiCillo credit for amusingly offbeat
casting -- Marlo Thomas as a Helmut Newton-style fashion photographer is
particularly sharp -- but much of  "Blonde" is just plain dumb. James

     Daryl Hannah plays the titular character in "The Real Blonde," which
does not bode well, considering the fact that the last film in which Hannah
had this distinction was 1993's "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman."  Nonetheless,
 the film manages to achieve a degree of respectability (far surpassing the
debacle that was "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"), but not much else.
     The subjects of this film are the intertwined worlds of modeling, soap
operas, and music videos in New York City, and given the nature of these
industries, it is obvious from the beginning that the film's director (Tom
DiCillo of "Living in Oblivion" fame) is setting us up for another stale
commentary about the superficiality of these image industries with little
actual plot to revolve around.
     In contrast to "Living in Oblivion," wherein DiCillo focused on the
humor surrounding the mishaps of a low-budget film production, "The Real
Blonde" is centered primarily around the dramatic and moral issues that
those involved with these image-oriented industries undergo.  Sadly, the
humor is lost, despite the presence within the film of such talented comic
artists as Christopher Lloyd, Buck Henry, and Dave Chappelle.
     Despite this limitation, the film does contain some interesting
elements.  At a certain point in the movie, we begin to realize that "The
Real Blonde" is not only criticizing the three industries mentioned above
for their obsession with sex objects and artifice, but it is
self-reflexively criticizing itself for focusing on the same artificial
reality.  Additionally, the startling intrusions of the intermittent dream
sequences are also pleasantly appealing.
     Ultimately, despite solid performances by Matthew Modine as Joe, a
struggling serious actor who takes on background work in a Madonna video to
get his foot in the door, newcomer Maxwell Caulfield who is convincingly
creepy as Joe's former best friend turned soap star, and Elizabeth Berkeley,
continuing her slow post-"Showgirls" return to the living with a solid
performance as a Madonna body-double, the film fails to follow through with
any true substance.
     "The Real Blonde" is as artificial as the world that it portrays.

Tom Dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in
superficial careers, all searching for deeper meaning. However, they
won't find much meaning in The Real Blonde, and not enough real humor,
either.
Joe (Matthew Modine) is a struggling actor, or he claims to be one, even
though he has no credits under his belt.  His girlfriend, Mary
(Catherine Keener) has no pretensions about her career:  she's a makeup
artist, working for the eccentric fashion photographer Blair (Marlo
Thomas) and supermodel of the month, Sahara (Bridgette Wilson).
Sahara, who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of
The Little Mermaid, has an on-again, off-again relationship with Joe's
best friend, Bob (Maxwell Caulfield).  However, Bob has gotten his
biggest break yet:  a starring role on a soap opera opposite the
beautiful Kelly (Daryl Hannah), who may be that illusive woman he's
always pursued: a real blonde.
There are some moments of good humor in The Real Blonde, but not enough.
The best stuff is in throwaway details in the background, such as
Sahara's perfume ads: "Depression - It's Not Just a State of Mind". But
to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot
fish in a barrel.
And, unfortunately, the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are
pathetic.  Take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and
her dog.  The story serves absolutely no purpose, makes little sense,
and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie.
Matthew Modine and Catherine Keener have the most sympathetic characters
in the film, but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines.  Modine
whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched
against someone stronger than Elizabeth Berkley, who appears as another
struggling actor.  Keener's character has a stronger edge, but the
insult self-defense class (taught by Denis Leary, no less) she is stuck
in makes little sense.
The movie's running time is under two hours, but it seems like it is
well over it. There's just not enough humor to speed things along, and
not enough meaning to propel any drama.

REAL BLONDE, THE (director: Tom DiCillo; cast: Matthew Modine (Joe),
Catherine Keener (Mary), Daryl Hannah (Kelly), Maxwell Caulfield (Bob),
Elizabeth Berkley (Tina), Marlo Thomas (Blair), Bridgette Wilson
(Sahara), Christopher Lloyd (Ernst), Kathleen Turner (Dee Dee Taylor),
Denis Leary (Doug), Steve Buscemi (Nick), 1997)
A fine looking, but extremely lightweight satire from Tom DiCillo
(Living in Oblivion, Box of Moonlight). I could not take this satirical
comedy as a serious work of satire, as the story is rife with unresolved
issues it brings up just to be seemingly ironical but with not enough
conviction or intensity of purpose to make something out of its mocking
tone, that is attacking both the television and fashion industry.
Joe (Modine) is the actor/waiter, who is currently out of acting work
because he won't do soaps and has set unrealistic goals for his career.
He is supposedly the high minded idealist and spokesman for the
director's views. One of his pet gripes seems to be in the hypocrisy of
men's and women's behavior toward each other; such as, the
double-standards maintained by them on sexual issues and in the way they
model underwear differently. There is also the film's other major theme,
of characters who fool themselves into chasing after a fool's gold,
deluding themselves into thinking they are happy with such worthless
trophies. All the characters are busy pursuing their goals to succeed in
the image-oriented fashion industry or in the cheesy video and TV soap
opera markets of New York.
Unfortunately, the satire has little bite to it. DiCillo couldn't make
up his mind what he wanted to do, so the characters end up as being
viewed as satires of themselves. I'm sure no one in the "industry" is
going to be too taken aback by this film's attack on them. But the
audience will see a well crafted film, that is pleasant to watch, but
with hardly any laughs to garner from it.
Joe is living with Mary (Keener), who happens to do the makeup for the
beautiful model Sahara (Bridgette), the perfect body of the Depression
perfume ads. She even sleeps under a framed poster of her Depression ad.
Sahara is vain and full of self-pity for herself, dying her hair blonde,
and pathetically searching for something spiritual and romantic in her
life. She gets picked up in a bar by Joe's actor friend and fellow
waiter, Bob (Caulfield), who has this thing for blondes, and when he
finds out that she is really not a blonde he treats her rather shabbily
after a night of sex.
Mary and Joe are the only really nice people in this story, ever vocal
about their personal desires after their six-year live-in relationship
has hit some rough spots. They are portrayed as being unfairly submerged
in the fake world of ephemeral fame and false appearances. Their story
is what is supposed to tug at our heart strings and also make us laugh,
as they try and handle all the obstacles they are up against. All that
she wants him to do is get a job so that he can make real money and all
he wants is for her to love him unconditionally.
Theirs is a romance that is marked by secret psychological problems,
sexual dissatisfaction, and open bitterness. This seems to make them out
to be more real than Bob and Sahara; at least, in their eyes.
Bob and Sahara's relationship is almost destroyed by their inability to
be who they really are. Bob's big disappointment comes, suprisingly
enough, when he has reached great heights in the career he has chosen.
He finds this out on the soap opera job he lands when to his delight,
his co-star is the real blonde, Kelly (Hannah). At the time of his big
sexual moment with her, everything that can go wrong, does, as he
becomes impotent. Kelly will then dump him, while he will get even with
her, by getting her killed off the soap.
The story line followed these four pivotal characters through some of
their glittery NYC experiences. It succeeded in telling their side of
the story. The only thing is that their story was not that different
from those who were depicted as being superficial.
The best results gleamed from the film were in moments of small truths:
Joe getting work through his possible agent (Turner) as a macho extra,
wearing a bathing suit in a Madonna video. This was especially amusing
because Joe had to betray all his lofty views just to get this vulgar
job, before losing it because he mouths off to an ignorant assistant
director. Another great scene, was how Mary had to fend off her judo
teacher (Leary) from sexual advances, who is teaching her how to act
when verbally or physically attacked in the street. She rids her
feelings of hatred for men by pummeling the less-than-true instructor.
She will also have the same sexual problem with her shrink (Buck Henry),
who can't stop telling her how much he is attracted to her.
But all the film added up to, was an easy to watch, slick NYC life-style
satirical story about those trying to make it in the glamor business,
told by an interesting director who tried to say something more than
what was actually said.

   "The Real Blonde" is a very New York movie, though its
principal conceits would make it feel right at home in L.A.  A
sendup of slickness for its own sake, Tom DiCillo's
marvelously realized work sometimes flirts with the very
slickness it parodies, but DiCillo--whose previous film "Living
in Oblivion" was looser in design and not as ambitious--
remains almost uncompromisingly independent and original.   
Highlighting a central relationships which is headed for the
rocks, "The Real Blonde" hosts a large cast playing hilariously
written roles, which are well acted and contribute mightily
toward making this a spiny film about the absurdities of
artifice and the need for a more natural way of living.
   As the plot's center, Joe (Matthew Modine) is a flawed
human being living together with a perfectly stable woman,
Mary (Catherine Keener), who ironically is undergoing
psychotherapy for hostilities which she has every right to
possess.  After all, how should any woman feel when each
day she is verbally attacked by the bum on the street corner
and has to cope with a steady who at the age of 35 has little
concept of reality?  For his part Joe considers himself a
serious actor, though he has no credits and no agent, yet
does not want to consider roles in soap operas or anything of
less artistic merit than "Death of a Salesman."  As the movie
meanders along, introducing a multiplicity of persons along
the way, we realize where the story is headed.  Joe and
Mary's relationship will either fall apart under the pressures of
both the outside society and their inner differences, or they
will enjoy a happy reconciliation when Joe has his feet no
longer planted firmly in midair.
   And oh what an assortment of oddballs and curious
situations they encounter during the course of the comedy! 
DiCillo has a ball taking aim on the popular culture of high
fashion, MTV, and soaps, displaying before us a host of
people who are all unhappy despite the glamorous positions
in which they find themselves.  Why should Joe's strikingly
handsome, well-spoken friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) feel
that his life is useless unless he can bed a blonde--a real
blonde, that is?  And would Doug (Denis Leary), a instructor
in self-defense techniques for women, be expected to have
contempt for the very clients he is trying to help in their
struggle against exploitative men?  Some of the best scenes
in the film point out ironies like these, and do so with style
and grand humor.  In one such episode Ernst (Christopher
Lloyd--who is best known for his role as a scientist in "Back to
the Future") is a grouchy, unsmiling headwaiter in a fancy
catering establishment who chews out one of his staff for
looking like a zombie.  In another, Kelly (Daryl Hannah), quick
to threaten suicide in a soap opera she is filming with Bob,
acts hardly the vulnerable type in her real life affair with the
male star.  
   The highlight of this well-written script features a
confrontation between Joe and the set manager of an MTV
routine featuring a Madonna lookalike (Elizabeth Berkley) and
a host of beach boys in shorts who are all directed to do a
double-take when the international star passes through their
ranks.  When the African-American man with the bullhorn
suggests to two impressionable actors on the set that the
Holocaust was a myth, Joe confronts the jerk with a smile on
his face, incongruously suggesting that slavery was likewise a
fraud: that Africans came to American shores during and after
the 17th Century simply because they wanted better jobs
working in the cotton fields.  He gets fired for his mock views,
the writer-director suggesting that speaking your mind is not
always in everyone's best interest in a culture that virtually
worships anorectic and absurd Versace-type fashion models
like one such person, Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), who
considers "The Little Mermaid" the ultimate in spiritual
moviemaking.
   In other vignettes Marlo Thomas comes across in a
whimsical manner as a high-profile fashion photographer who,
when discovering that her chief model has come in with a
black eye, has similar bruises painted on her other models
while photographing them with large snakes wrapped about
their limbs, rose petals dropping to their laps.
   Matthew Modine, perhaps the least sexy young person in
this world of artifice, is perfectly cast as a guy who gets a
belated start in his career only by dropping his standards but
who parlays his work into a serious calling once his foot is in
the door.  Denis Leary, Daryl Hannah, and Buck Henry help
realize the director's vision by showing themselves for what
they really are and how they really feel about the people they
work with: and what they really are is anything but nice.
"The Real Blonde" has a plot line that is not tight enough to
give it a widespread market but will appeal immensely to all
who can appreciate its sharp, urban humor. Not Rated.

     With THE REAL BLONDE, director Tom DiCillo places another 
interesting title onto a diverse resume which already includes JOHNNY 
SUEDE, LIVING IN OBLIVION, and BOX OF MOONLIGHT.  THE REAL BLONDE, which 
examines the difference between illusion and reality, and satirizes the 
acting industry, is easily the lightest of DiCillo's films, and, 
although the seams in the plot are visible (the movie plays best as a 
series of loosely-connected comic vignettes), there's enough light 
substance and lighter humor to warrant a recommendation.
     The principals are Joe (Matthew Modine) and Bob (Maxwell 
Caulfield), a pair of out-of-work actors who are making a living waiting 
tables for the ever-stern Ernst (Christopher Lloyd).  Joe believes in 
the purity of his craft  the only kinds of acting jobs he's interested 
in are "serious" ones.  His resolve is tested, however, when Bob gets a 
plum role on the soap opera PASSION CREST.  There's nothing remotely 
respectable about the part, but it offers Bob a regular income of $3600 
per week and turns him into an overnight heartthrob.  Suddenly, a 
jealous Joe, with some prodding from his live-in girlfriend, Mary 
(Catherine Keener), decides that if he's going to be an actor, he's 
going to have to compromise his values.  So he goes to his agent 
(Kathleen Turner) and tells her he's willing to do anything  even a TV 
commercial or a music video.
     The title comes from an obsession of Bob's  for him, Ms. Right has 
to be a "real blonde."  His on-again, off-again girlfriend, insecure 
supermodel Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), is a sweet, gorgeous girl, but 
she's got a dye job.  Bob finds what he thinks he wants in Kelly (Daryl 
Hannah), his leading lady on the soap.  He soon learns, however, that 
just because a woman really has blond hair doesn't mean that there's 
nothing artificial about her personality.  
     One aspect of American culture that THE REAL BLONDE successful 
captures (and skewers) is the hollowness of what we're exposed to 
through the media.  Image and fantasy are everything; reality is 
valueless.  Bob is obsessed with a "real blonde" because he's tired of 
fake women  the irony is that he's just as artificial as any of the 
girls he goes out with.  Meanwhile, Joe complains that "everyone around 
me is false, so I'm constantly lowering my ideals."  Photo shoots are 
exposed as far more grueling and unpleasant than the sexy, glossy images 
would indicate.  And a Madonna music video features a body double 
(Elizabeth Berkley) lip-synching the words.  What's authentic in an 
industry of make-believe?
     The acting is a mixed bag.  Matthew Modine is decidedly unappealing 
as Joe, and, since we're supposed to sympathize with him (even though 
he's a whiner), this is a source of minor irritation.  On the other 
hand, Catherine Keener (who has appeared in all of DiCillo's films) is 
luminous.  Mary is down-to-earth and likable, which helps compensate for 
the lack in Modine's performance.  Max Caulfield and Bridgette Wilson 
give effectively comic turns as shallow people.  Daryl Hannah, not known 
as an actress of great range, is also surprisingly good, perhaps in part 
because she's essentially lampooning an image of herself.  There are 
also a number of cameos:  Christopher Lloyd, Denis Leary, Kathleen 
Turner, Steve Buscemi, Buck Henry, and Marlo Thomas.
     Of course, while THE REAL BLONDE has a message, that's not its most 
noteworthy aspect.  The comedy in the film, which varies from clever and 
insightful ("Empty V"  say that aloud) to downright silly (Joe's 
bathing suit), frequently works.  I especially loved a scene in which 
just about everyone in a restaurant contributes to a deconstruction of 
THE PIANO.  That sequence alone is almost worth the price of admission.  
Overall, however, THE REAL BLONDE would have been even more satisfying 
if it had seemed like a coherent whole rather than a batch of skits 
loosely connected by DiCillo's story arc of a struggling actor trying to 
remain true to both his calling and the woman he loves.  Nevertheless, 
in part because of Keener's appeal and in part because DiCillo gets his 
point across with a successful portion of humor, THE REAL BLONDE is 
enjoyable and inviting.

        In the James Bond film "Diamonds Are Forever," Tiffany Case asks
007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads.  Bond's response is that it
doesn't really matter, as long as collars and cuffs match.
        Well, collars and cuffs don't match in "The Real Blonde."  What
might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny, meandering
comedy on screen.
        The film, supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas
and the modeling business, is wafer thin.  It plays like an "Ally McBeal"
episode dragged out to the nth degree, replete with a few unnecessary
"fantasy" sequences.  Writer/director Tom DiCillo manages the material as
if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea.  It isn't.  The only
surprise here is that the talented DiCillo could make familiar terrain so
dreary.
        Matthew Modine plays Joe, a struggling actor waiting tables in
order to pay the rent.  He's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too
proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas.  "That's not really
acting" he tells his girlfriend of six years, Mary (Catherine Keener), with
whom he bickers constantly about sex.  But they need the money, so Joe
finally agrees to take a part in a Madonna video.  But it's not really
Madonna starring in the video but a lookalike (played by Elizabeth Berkley,
still trying to jump-start her career after "Showgirls").  This points out
how artificial this whole business is, one supposes.
        DiCillo has referred to "The Real Blonde" as "off-kilter, but an
interesting combination of all sorts of stuff..."  The film, which wanders
all over the place without getting anywhere, is remarkably *on*-kilter and,
with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable Modine (who's not
afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by
hunks), the entire cast is vague and uninteresting.
        Catherine Keener, who's appeared in DiCillo's previous three films
(including the brilliant "Living In Oblivion"), is at her most annoying in
"The Real Blonde."  Look at her closely; she really can't act at all.  Her
reactions are all wrong, almost always out of sync with her co-stars.  She
reacts too soon, or too late, to lines and situations.  She moves her eyes,
or her mouth, far too much.  She frowns, she yells, she babbles--she blows
chunks.
        Maxwell Caulfield plays Joe's actor/waiter buddy Bob, the one
obsessed with dating a "natural" blonde.  Bob's personality (not to mention
Caulfield's acting ability) parallels that of the character he plays on the
soap opera "Passion Crest"--stiff and uninteresting.  Maybe that's the
point.  Daryl Hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the
title, a soap dish who beds Bob both on- and off-camera.  Hannah looks
about fifty in this movie (she's only 37).  Why is that?  Almost all the
women in the film wear tops that show their nipples.  WHY IS THAT!?  Marlo
Thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer.  Kathleen Turner plays
an uninteresting talent agent.  Buck Henry plays an uninteresting shrink.
Christopher Lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer.  And so on.
        The best parts of the "The Real Blonde" are the beginning and the
end, brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog.
There's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive
face than in the entire film.  While this contrast is supposedly meant to
highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives, the only thing
that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny.

     Like those sex comedies that used to be so popular, Mary and her
live-in boyfriend Joe spend a lot of time in bed arguing about sex in
the movie THE REAL BLONDE.  He doesn't think she is experimental and
aggressive enough, but she has a completely different perspective about
the quality of their sex life.  The net result is that they spend more
time bickering about it than doing it.
     As waiter and would-be actor Joe, Matthew Modine gives a witty and
wise performance.  Catherine Keener plays his girlfriend, Mary, who
definitely does not want a family, especially given Joe's minuscule
income.  They will both will be tempted by others -- he by a Madonna
body double and she by a women's self-defense instructor, played by a
remarkably low-key Denis Leary.
     As Joe's friend, fellow waiter and Royal Academy trained actor
Bob, Maxwell Caulfield gives the show's blandest performance.  When we
first meet Bob he is sneaking out of the bed of a gorgeous blonde named
Tina because he realizes that she is not a real blonde.  Elizabeth
Berkley from SHOWGIRLS plays the airhead, Tina, who doesn't have much
luck with her men no matter how beautiful she is.  Tina has strange
views on life.  As just one example, she finds THE LITTLE MERMAID and
all of the Disney cartoons quite spiritual.
     Yes, Bob will eventually meet a real blonde, a soap actress star
played by the lovely Daryl Hannah, who seems to look younger as she
gets older.  Bob runs into a slew of problems once he finds his real
blonde.
     The movie is filled with known actors in small performances that
are more than cameos but less than major parts.  Marlo Thomas plays an
ever resourceful fashion photographer.  When Tina, her big star, shows
up one day with an ugly, black eye, Thomas improvises.  Quick, paint
fake bruises on all of the models.  The injuries will go nicely with
the big snakes, a la the famous Nastassja Kinski photo.
     Christopher Lloyd shows up as a hard-driving head waiter who runs
his charges like they were recruits at boot camp.  Kathleen Turner
takes a small part as a tough minded agent who gets Joe a small part in
a Madonna music video.
     Steve Buscemi takes the role of a music video director.  He takes
one look at the pasty looking Joe with his boxer shorts and large rear
end and moves him to the back row of the male dancers.
     A subtheme in the picture is the sexual harassment of women on the
streets of New York City, where the film is set.  The women wear
see-through blouses, low-cut dresses, and short skirts, which arouses
the local winos and perverts.  They make lewd remarks at the women.
Joe, who seems most interested in the harassment issue, keeps reading
the lingerie and other ads and developing deep sounding but superficial
theories about their demeaning women.
     If the story sounds disorganized, it is.  Written and directed by
Tom DiCillo from BOX OF MOONLIGHT, the movie meanders, not going
anyplace in particular.  The film begins and ends with an unrelated
story of a stolen dog and has little structure.  Some of the jokes work
while others fall flat.
     In a restaurant scene Joe and Mary have dinner with a nouveau
riche artist friend of theirs and his wife.  The artist raves about the
movie  IL PIANO, and the two women agree.  Joe says the picture was
complete garbage, and soon every table in the restaurant is having
their own argument over the film.  This funny scene works so well
because it is at once outlandish and realistic.  When has someone not
praised a movie that you hated, but you tried to be polite and kept
your opinions to yourself or at least muted what you had to say?
     But for every good scene like the one above, there are others with
promise but no laughs.  When the meekest and homeliest woman in the
self-defense class is brought up to challenge the instructor, the scene
withers before ever it starts to bloom.  The joke is that she doesn't
attack him at all, which probably sounded funny in the script but is
staged with little style or impact.
     Although the light-weight film doesn't have much compelling
material, the cast gives it their all.  The result is a periodically
funny picture that does have its entertaining moments.
     THE REAL BLONDE runs 1:47.  It is rated R for nudity, sex and
profanity and would be fine for most teenagers.

There are several things that make THE REAL BLONDE such a delight to
watch.    There's the sexy, fun story and realistic dialogue, both by
Tom Dicillo,  the fine acting by the entire cast which consists of
some great names even in the smaller roles.   Take Kathleen Turner
as a powerful casting agent such as is found in the real world of TV
and movies.   There is Marlo Thomas as a top notch photographer who
knows how to make a picture tell a story that is not true.  And
there is Buck Henry as a psychiatrist who would love to bed his
patients.  And Christopher Lloyd who runs a catering service that
employs actors between gigs or those who have yet to get their first
break,   Finally, Denis Leary as a women's self-defense instructor
who tries to come on to the women who have personal problems. Wrap
all that together by a fine director and you have one very
entertaining film.
 The story and all the characters ring true.   Joe (Matthew Madine)
and his live-in lover Mary (Catherine Keener) appear to be about at
the end of their relationship.   While Mary is a make-up artist for
TV and movies,  Joe is still waiting for his first job,    His only
income is as a waiter. Obsessed with never accepting a minor part in
a film as it would be too demeaning for someone who is as good as he
thinks he is, he is always out of work, always shooting off his
mouth and blowing his chances of ever getting  cast.   Mary has just
about had it with him even if they are in love.
 Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) is Joe's  friend and fellow-actor (and
waiter!).  His problem is he wants to find a real blonde, someone
who does not get her hair dyed; a natural.   To this end he runs
after every blonde he imagines will fill the bill.   What he really
wants is a woman whom he can love.    Among those he chases are
Kelly (Daryl Hannah in a superb performance) and Sahara (Bridgette
Wilson) who is seen as the perfect body on huge billboards.   Is he
happy?   Not at all.
 Joe finally settles for a role as an extra with a hundred other men
in a Madonna video.  He has to play up to casting director Dee Dee
Taylor (Kathleen Turner) in order to get the role.  When Joe meets
up with Tina, (Elizabeth Berkley) who is a Madonna double, his
morality suffers as he takes her to bed.   So much for HIS ethics.
 One would hope that despite the film being released so early in the
year, that come Oscar voting time in 1999, Matthew Modine and Daryl
Hannah  will be remembered.
 The movie runs along rapidly as we get to know all the characters
and meet those on their periphery who have a bearing on the story
and on their lives.   That there is not a dull moment in the film is
a tribute to the fine direction..
