I was flipping channels, whilst having a snack and  well .I came
across "Full Circle".
There's no point discussing acting or make, because we all know that
this movie was not made for Oscar contention. What interested me was the
plot? What makes people buy Danielle Steel's books?
It's about a girl who was raped by her mother's lover's son. The event
is hushed up because the mother, does not want to lose her lover boy.
The girl grows up to be a successful attorney, whose best friend, a guy,
becomes crippled in a car accident. She falls in love with the father of
her best friend, but rejects his advances because her best friend is in
love with her. She rejects a marriage proposal from her best friend, so
he marries somebody else.
So you think at this point the way is left open for her to marry the
father, but not so.
Instead she falls in love with a colleague who is married, but separated
from his wife. The colleague promises to file for divorce so that he can
marry her, but remains undecided about finalising it. Then comes the
cheesiest line in the whole movie. When he tells her I can't decide, I
love you both.'
Anyway, she leaves him. The boy friend dies of renal failure, and the
father marries someone else. So, that's why it's called "Full Circle" -
she starts alone and ends up alone- hooray! But not so. She has to spoil
the movie by marrying a high court judge and having a kid; and the real
reason why the movie is called "First Circle" is something to do with
love, and forgiveness  all which escapes me?
