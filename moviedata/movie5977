"Diamonds For Breakfast" is a comedy with surrealistic elements.
It fittingly stars Marcello Mastroianni, whose most famous film
is the surreal "8 1/2".  While the comedy often doesn't work,
the fantasy elements keep things interesting.
Mastroianni is the son of a Russian nobleman.   The nobleman 
gambled away the family jewels, and now they reside in a British
museum.  Mastroianni decides to steal the jewels.  To do this,
he recruits a series of beautiful women, each of whom will do
his bidding once he makes love to them.  In an elaborate
bait-and-switch scheme (the women are the bait, and the jewels
are switched) the jewels are his again!  But then things begin
to unravel...
To keep Mastroianni onscreen as much as possible, he plays other
roles as well, especially a bearded ancestor who appears now
and then to offer advice and encouragement.  Mastroianni also
sings the title song, where we learn that there are limits
to his talents.
Because of the mix of reality and fantasy, and a first-time
director apparently without anyone looking over his shoulder,
"Diamonds For Breakfast" is confusing and muddled.  Much of
the storyline is difficult to accept even in a comedy, such
as the ease in which the diamonds are switched, and Mastroianni's
success with "the family gift", which appears to be the ability
to bed any woman and convert her into a slave.  Also curious
is that with all these beauties to choose from, the woman he
prefers is also the least attractive.
Not quite there either as a comedy or as an art film, "Diamonds
For Breakfast" is doomed to obscurity.  It is recommended only
to Mastroianni fans.
