Wrestling - for all of its flash pots, Solid Gold dancers, and large,
scantily clad, sweaty men  is the 21st century version of Ringing
Bros., Barnum and Bailey's traveling tent show.  When I was a kid, I
used to watch the exploits of Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage,
and the Honky Tonk Man.  The newest generation of wrestlers have never
interested me, with all of the theatrics and bad, bad attitudes toward
almost everything under the sun.  The `sport' of wrestling has become
three hours of anger, deception, sexual dominance, and violent acts with
chairs.  The one thing that has always eluded me with the newest
generation of wrestlers  Goldberg, Sting, Mankind, and The Rock  is
the human element that drew me into the action so well as a kid.  But
Ready to Rumble helped remind me of the glory days I once had, sitting
before the 13-inch RCA with the bottom knob broken off, watching my
heroes triumph over the adversities of life's travels.
The film follow two losers, played by Scott Caan and David Arquette, who
run a septic truck business for the local town of Lusk, Wyoming.  Their
idol is Jimmy King, grand champion belt holder of the WCW Federation,
who proclaims `I WILL RULE YOU!' after every victory.  Caan and Arquette
attend a WCW bout and, in horror, watch their idol fall from grace by
turncoat WCW wrestlers.  Jimmy King is beaten to a bloody pulp and a
fellow wrestler, Diamond Dallas Page, takes the belt from the fallen
king.  After the show, Caan and Arquette strike out to find their
defeated hero and once again place the crown upon the rightful king of
the ring.
The strengths of the film lie in its wonderful script.  It draws from
the familiar lines of many sport films yet retains a strong sense of
disbelief that helps carry the emotions of the characters to a
heart-pounding end.  Arquette and Caan put out wonderful performances of
simple men looking to fulfill their dreams without anything standing in
their way.  The supporting cast of real wrestlers  Goldberg, Sting,
Macho Man Randy Savage, and Mr. Perfect  lend their acting chops to
help authenticate the action.  And director Brian Robbins lends a
confident hand at capturing the beauty of the choreographed moves,
strongly capturing the feeling of this `circus' masquerading as a
professional sport.
But the best thing about the movie is how damn funny it is.  The scenes
are littered with enough foul humor to embarrass the Farrelly Brothers
but are carried by the convictions of the characters and the innocence
of common men in the presence of giants.  Even Joe Pantoliano, playing a
sleazy wrestling promoter responsible for the King's downfall, and Oscar
winner Martin Landau, playing an old-school wrestler who trains King,
bring wonderful diversity to the characters in the film.  Rose McGowan
shines as well as a manipulative WCW dancer who likes to wrestle and
growl in bed.
Ready to Rumble is a fun, rambunctious film filled with laughs and a
great storyline.  Take your favorite wrestling fan (or your favorite
closeted wrestling fan) and a good time is guaranteed.

IN SHORT: You will laugh until it hurts. Or hurt until you laugh.
There is no question about it, David Arquette is one very starange dude.
he's strange when he does talk show. He's very strange in his 1-800
telephone ads. But he's off the charts as Gordie Biggs, son of and
brother of cops, who faces certain redneck cop doom in his hometown of
Lusk, Wyoming. He resists wearing the badge, instead driving a septic
tank with best buddy Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) at his side.
Like lots of almost adults facing years of dreary hell in the only life
available to them, Gordie and Sean find a fantasy outlet to take away
the pain and make it all better. [actually, with twenty minutes or so of
jokes about Number Two, the pain was pretty much inflicted on these old
reviewers bones]. Not drugs. Not sex. Something far more important on
the vast scale of things cosmic. The eternal battle of good versus evil,
Order versus Chaos, Blood and Sweat versus Pernicious Evil brought about
by lying, cheating and distracting the referees. Yes, the merger of Ted
Turner and Time Warner has led us down the path to a movie starring
World Championship Wrestling, called Ready To Rumble, which surely is as
close a representation of Hell as anything Cranky has ever sat through .
.. .
Well, it felt that way for the first twenty minutes, in which we made
the observation that if Bill and Ted had the intelligence of Beavis and
Butt-head, they would be Sean and Gordy, who find the Meaning of Life in
their quest to restore the greatest WCW wrester of all, Jimmy King
(Oliver Platt) to his throne as heavyweight champion of the WCW. In
their way is Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), evil mastermind of the
WCW, and every wrestling actor who ever dreamed of wearing the belt,
which means appearances by just about everyone you see on WCW Monday
Night Nitro. Except Hulk Hogan.
Ready to Rumble is no great film, but it is a bust a gut funny piece of
[deleted]. One that will go down in the anals of film comedy (its heroes
suck out port-a-potties) as a jaw dropper stinker that keeps coming back
at you, like a bad bit o' beef, until you have no choice but to roll
over and cackle, guffaw, chuckle, grimace, shudder, or, failing that,
apologize profusely to your date (or all of the above).
Yep, it's American Pie all over again. From director Brian Robbins (of
Varsity Blues, which I liked) and Steven Brill, the writer of
Heavyweights (Cranky's 6 year old nephew's favorite film of all time)
and Mighty Ducks One Two and Three comes a movie which bombards you with
joke after joke until you just can't stand it no more. Teenlets will eat
this stuff up from the word go. Old farts like Cranky were writhing in
pain Ready to Rumble then unleashes the greatest gag of all . . .
Martin Landau in the role of a retired wrestler whose skills and
attitude are such that he could turn Sid Vicious (whoever) into a whiny
little girly man.
OK that's it. Three taps and I give. Ready to Rumble is funny. Once it
gets past the dumb jokes and brings in the inevitable sex element, in
the persona of Nitro Girl Sasha (Rose McGowan), it gets even funnier.
Once you fall into the gaping maw of jokes it will chomp you up and spit
out an exhausted, laughed out mess.
Ready to Rumble is buffoonery stretched to the limit, culminating in a
three cage wrestling death match, in which the sound levels on the
special effects are pushed up to ear cracking levels. Professional
Wrestling may be "fake" but that doesn't stop these mammoth-men from
hurting each other, which happens in "real life" and in this flick and,
all the while, they keep cracking jokes.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Ready to Rumble, he would have
paid...
Yep, it's a dateflick (lighten up, it's just a movie). Best guide I can
give is that, if you're in to WCW or WWF right now, or have been and
remember flicks like Bill and Ted or or the Beavis and Butt-Head stuff
with affection, you'll probably piss yourself laughing at Ready To
Rumble

_Ready_to_Rumble_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
Professional wrestling has long suffered the criticism that it caters to
the most lowbrow audience with its barely organized displays of violence.
 But as low as wrestling goes, rarely does it plunge to the crass depths
explored by the wrestling-themed comedy _Ready_to_Rumble_, which goes out
of its way to prove that tastelessness does not equal comic inspiration.
To their credit, writer Steven Brill and director Brian Robbins satisfy
their crudest instincts in the film's early stages, which concerns
fanatical World Championship Wrestling (as opposed to World Wrestling
Federation) fans Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean's (Scott Caan) search
for their hero, dethroned and disgraced wrestling champion Jimmy King
(Oliver Platt).  Gordie and Sean work in sanitation--namely, the cleaning
of portapotties--so leave it to Brill and Robbins to not leave any raw
sewage joke uncovered.  They even go the extra mile, venturing beyond
mere jokes about excrement and flatulence into the territory of crab
lice.  Prefer cheap slapstick over bodily function humor?  Worry you
not--the film's opening "match" set in a convenience store is but the
first in a very long line of brutal fights unsuccessfully played for
laughs.
_Ready_to_Rumble_ is rated PG-13, and it provides ample ammunition for
the argument that the MPAA ratings board is extremely lenient when it
comes to violence.  Very little blood is shed in _Rumble_, but many
severe beatings are suffered by a number of characters, including a
"Nitro Girl" cheerleader named Sasha (Rose McGowan) at the hands of her
"boyfriend" Gordie.  While there is no doubt as to the less-than-serious
intent, there is nothing particularly cartoonish about the execution:
those are real kicks and punches being thrown, and genuine body slams and
other wrestling maneuvers being performed.  While being inundated with so
much brutality for such a long while, it's impossible to stop lightly
giggling (which is the most any of the mayhem will induce) and start
cringing.
While such poor content makes it mighty tempting to walk out of the
auditorium and never return, I remained curiously fascinated for a couple
of reasons.  First, the film is so audacious in its stupidity I had a
masochistic urge to see just how low it would go.  Second, I was taken
aback by the actors, who displayed some admirable conviction in their
work--a fact made more admirable by the questionable nature of their
material.  Gordie and Sean do find "the King" and help him mount a
comeback, and the uphill struggle back to glory is given some
surprising--and wholly undeserved--resonance by Platt.  And though
they're called on to do nothing more than play obnoxious jackasses for
the entire run time, there's also no question that Arquette and Caan
succeed in fulfilling that requirement.
In the world of professional wrestling, the World Championship Wrestling
organization is widely regarded as being a bit more tasteful and--dare I
say it--classy than its raunchier (and more popular) rival, the World
Wrestling Federation.  I guess the WCW higher-ups figures that if they
can't beat 'em, join 'em, for the big screen commercial that is
_Ready_to_Rumble_ just proves that the WCW can sink to the same lows in
taste, albeit in a more spectacular, big-screen fashion.

Landau, Joe Pantoliano, Caroline Rhea, Ahmet Zappa
Featured Wrestlers: Bill Goldberg, "Diamond" Dallas Page, Sting, Disco
Inferno, Sid Vicious, Bam Bam Bigelow, Perry Saturn, Curt Hennig
Written by: Steven Brill
Directed by: Brian Robbins
Running Time: 107 minutes
Harmless, silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans Gordie
and Sean (David Arquette and Scott Caan) who idolize current World
Championship Wrestling heavyweight champion Jimmy King (Oliver Platt). 
When King is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter (Joe
Pantoliano), Gordie and Sean take it upon themselves to find their
fallen hero and restore his glory.
My biggest fear about Ready to Rumble was dispatched early on, as the
filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed (but
not fake, mind you).  The hook of the movie is that Gordie and Sean are
just TOO stupid to realize that.
Arquette and Caan are suitably over the top with their performances,
which is exactly what a movie like this requires, and Oliver Platt (one
of my favorite actors) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion. 
Many have scoffed at the idea that Platt should be playing a heavyweight
champion wrestler with an unbeaten record, but for me it just added to
the "silly factor" of the film, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it. 
One casting complaint however: Rose McGowan as a sexy dancer?  Please...
if Rose McGowan is sexy then I'm Marilyn Manson.
Given the current state of the actual WCW, if Oliver Platt were
appearing as Jimmy King right now on WCW programming, he'd be the most
popular guy they have.  On a similar note, the "plot line" of the
wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the
WCW writers have been able to come up with in the last two years. 
Although one does have to ask... why would any wrestling promoter fire
the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely
popular with the fans?
Director Brian Robbins (you'll remember him as Eric from TV's "Head of
the Class") just knows how to make good dumb movies.  This movie fits in
nicely with his previous efforts Good Burger and Varsity Blues.  And
screenwriter Steven Brill (the epic Mighty Ducks trilogy, Late Last
Night) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same
time, with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me. 
The only exceptions to that were: 1) a scene involving a van full of
singing nuns and 2) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan. 
Those moments made me cringe and/or groan.  As an added bonus though,
the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits
roll.  [PG-13]

Walking into "Ready to Rumble", the new film from Hollywood's biggest
goofball, David Arquette ("Scream", those annoying 1-800-call-ATT
commercials), I figured there were two possibilities for this movie. It was
going to be stupid, the previews had already given that much away. The
question now, was whether it was going to be the sort of stupid which you
can't help but chuckle at, or the just plain moronic kind. It turns out that
the movie has a little of both. While there are a lot of faults, there are
also one or two really funny scenes and a few others you can't help but find
amusing no matter how low brow they might be. However, the film's biggest
problem is the premise itself. How can one make a movie that pokes fun at
professional wrestling when wrestling already pokes fun at itself?
Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) have only one great love in
their lives. This all consuming passion is professional wrestling, and
specifically worship for their idol, Jimmy "The King" King (Oliver Platt).
They have just obtained tickets to the latest match between The King and
Diamond Dallas Page (Page Falkinburg). They are horrified to find that
King's manager, Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), has rigged the match so
that King will not only lose, but will be ejected from the wrestling circuit
forever. Now Gordie and Sean have only one purpose in life: to get The King
his crown back. However, they soon discover that their idol may not be all
they thought he was, and professional wrestling may be *gasp* fake afterall!
When I said there are one or two really funny scenes in this movie I wasn't
kidding. Fortunately, there are enough mildly amusing scenes to make up for
this. The interesting thing is that, the best part of this movie isn't the
comedy, it's the massive wrestling match at the film's end. The problem with
this is that it's a long, and at times very dull, trip to that payoff.
Another problem is that while the majority of the jokes may fall flat, at
least the actors are trying their best to pull something out of them.
However, at other times the movie seems to be trying to convey some message
about wrestlers and their fans and this not only doesn't work, but seriously
detracts from the rest of the film. I suppose this is because anything
serious seems completely out of place in a movie this goofy.
As for the actors, I've never really cared for David Arquette. He may have
been somewhat entertaining in the "Scream" films, but I think this is
because Wes Craven kept him tightly reined in. Otherwise, he has a tendancy
to overact to the point where the audience expects him to rip out of the
screen and start bouncing off the walls. Scott Caan ("Boiler Room", "Black
and White") hasn't appeared in much till now, but he turns in a remarkably
restrained performance considering his co-star. As for Oliver Platt ("Lake
Placid"), whom I consider one of the better comic actors working in
Hollywood, he is woefully miscast as a professional wrestler. The problem
is, Platt is not particularly tall, rather overweight, and about as vicious
looking as a small dog. Being surrounded by real wrestlers, like Bill
Goldberg throughout the movie, only makes him look more ridiculous in this
role.
"Ready to Rumble" has a typical soundtrack for this type of movie. It's
filled with popular alternative music, and it was certainly a welcome change
from the constant rap soundtracks I've been hearing lately. Brian Robbins
("Varsity Blues") doesn't exactly seem to be directing this movie. He simply
seems to be allowing the actors to do whatever they feel like to try and get
a laugh out of Stephen Brill's ("The Mighty Ducks") rather weak script. I'm
not sure if this was a good idea, but keeping David Arquette under control
certainly couldn't have hurt the film. "Ready to Rumble" runs far too long
at 122 minutes, and should have been no more than 95. I'd recommend "Ready
to Rumble" to wrestling fans since they will most likely recognize a few
familiar faces and give it three out of five stars.

 Here's a quiz: Do you really believe that pro wrestlers fight
a legitimate bout? Do you consider them "superior athletes, superior
men"?  Do you feel that women are mindless sex objects who just love
to be punched in the face? Are you easily amused by bodily emission
humor and scatological jokes? What about leaving your partner with an
itchy crotch as a memento of a marriage?  If you answered 'yes' to any
or all of the above, you're the target audience for this lamebrained
comedy. David Arquette and Scott Caan play upwardly mobile
portable-toilet maintenance workers in Lusk, Wyoming, who worship
Jimmy (The King) King of World Championship Wrestling, citing him as
"the greatest wrestler of all time." So when the pudgy King (Oliver
Platt), clad in a studded black leather body suit, loses his crown in
a bloody double-cross by his sleazy manager, they set out on a quest
to return him to what they believe is his rightful throne. Not the
Porto-San throne, of course, but that kind of confusion is typical of
the on-screen humor penned by Steven Brill and directed with stomping,
smackdown overkill by Brian Robbins. And it doesn't much matter to
anyone that, outside the ring, King is a boozing, deadbeat dad who
stole his poor parents' motor home.  If you're into this sport, you'll
recognize Diamond Dallas Page, Bill Goldberg, Bam Bam Bigelow, Konnan,
Kidman, Sting, Juventud Guerrero, Disco Inferno Saturn, Sid
Vicious. Martin Landau, Joe Pantoliano and Rose McGowan collected
salaries as supporting players but don't bet on mention of this
"credit" on their resumes two years from now. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Ready to Rumble" is a crude, mind-numbing 3, packed
with low blows. It's about as much fun as a low kick to the groin.

Rated PG-13 (for profanity, violence, brief nudity, and sexual situations).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, April 8, 2000.
The quality (or lack thereof) of "Ready to Rumble," an atrociously 
ill-advised comedy directed by Brian Robbins (1999's "Varsity Blues"), can be 
boiled down to one statement: take "Dumb & Dumber," add a wrestling angle to 
the storyline, and strip the proceedings of all signs of wit, interest, and 
laughs. 
Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) are lifelong best friends whose 
IQs are well into the lower double-digits, and who clean out septic tanks and 
port-a-potties for a living. Their lives revolve solely around two things: 
sewage and WCW wrestling, particularly their obsessive loyalty to their 
undefeated hero, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt). When the infamous (to them) 
Monday Night Nitro arrives in their small Wyoming town, Gordie and Sean 
eagerly are able to acquire tickets, but devastated when the King, for the 
first time, is defeated by Diamond Dallas Page (playing himself), and thus, 
gets his title of WCW Wrestler of the World taken away from him. Tracking the 
King down, Gordie and Sean find him holed up in a trailer park, almost 
penniless and boozed up into a drunken stupor. Their image of him remains 
untarnished, however, as their faithfulness overcomes the discouragingly 
troubled human being in front of them, and they persuade the King to attempt 
a comeback. 
"Ready to Rumble" is the type of nonsensical movie that one watches with a 
detached air in between them and the screen, until the moment when they 
question how something of such incredible vacuity was ever greenlit by the 
studio. The moment came for me during a dream sequence involving Gordie 
beating up the insulting worker of a convenience store. That moment was also, 
calamitously, at the five-minute mark of this overlong, 107-minute waste of 
celluloid. With nary a trace of clever writing or original subject matter for 
its so-called jokes, the film relies heavily on the needless exploitation of 
profanity-spewing women (including the charming Ellen Albertini Dow, the 
rappin' granny in 1998's "The Wedding Singer") and humor involving sewage, 
flatulence, and, well, there's a lot of sewage pratfalls. The only scene 
worth a deserved laugh is one in which Gordie and Sean hitch a ride with a 
van full of "Hallelujah"-singing nuns who, before long, are being taught the 
lyrics to "Shout at the Devil."
>From David Arquette to Scott Caan to Oliver Platt to Academy Award winner 
Martin Landau (as a retired wrestler who Gordie and Sean turn to for help in 
shaping up the King), what were these usually reliable actors thinking when 
they chose to participate in the making of such a film? Arquette, who is in 
great need of a barbituates overdose, hoots and hollers a lot, but does 
little else, while Scott Caan seems to be grinning and bearing his appearance 
here. Oddly enough, Oliver Platt is just about the least likely person to 
ever become a professional wrestler, and his casting is more of a stunt than 
anything; surely, a real-life wrestler would have fit this unfunny, 
straight-man role far more snugly, rather than a comedian who is given little 
chance to do anything other than look disgruntled. 
Once in an interview, actress Rose McGowan stated that she knew what a 
talented actress she could be, given the right material. There is no doubt 
that she can be good--just check out her standout performances in 1995's "The 
Doom Generation" and 1996's "Scream"--but, if so, then why is she wasting her 
time in such a disposable role, as Sasha, a scheming Nitro girl who has a 
fling with Gordie?
Thinking back of "Ready to Rumble," I am left with few words to describe the 
viewing experience, because it disparagingly leaves you with so little to 
think about or take away. There are amusing low-brow comedies (1980's 
"Airplane!," anything from the Farrelly brothers--heck, even 1996's "Happy 
Gilmore"), and then there are movies like "Ready to Rumble," that amaze you 
with their sheer stupidity and unwillingness to create anything that is the 
least bit worthy of wasting two hours of your life with.

Allow me to begin this review by apologizing. If this critique seems to be
below par in terms of quality, it is because I am confident that I am now a
great deal dumber having seen Ready to Rumble. Perhaps this is the film's
intent, to reduce educated persons to a level of idiocy, thus creating an
even playing field for those hardcore wrestling fans who will see the movie
because they have confidence that their sport is as real as any. Or perhaps,
in the more likely scenario, the film has no real intent whatsoever other
than to spew juvenile sight gags and jokes derived in the 4th grade boy's
bathroom through a vehicle as troubled as the leaky septic truck that the
production's protagonists drive.
Furthermore, I should let you know that this critique will contain no
intellectual interpretation whatsoever as the film has no such depth to
interpret. I dare even suggests that the filmmakers' concept of `highbrow'
is probably someone whose face expands while on an acid trip. At one point
one of the main characters ponders `if you only have one nut left, is it
still your left nut?' That is just about as deep as things get.
The film's heroes are Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott
Caan), two twenty-something wrestling fans obsessed with Jimmy `The King'
King (Oliver Platt). To give you an idea of just how annoying this duo can
be, if I were given a choice between spending an afternoon with them or
watching a Sylvester Stallone marathon, I would grab some popcorn and make
myself comfy.
The duo soon see their champion go down in the ring and set out on a mission
to rescue him and return him to his previous glory. But there are a few
problems: The king's castle is a stolen trailer, he owes child support, his
wife has a certain disease which I am too much of a gentleman to discuss in
this review and his thirst isn't for victory but rather beer.
The film's morals are about as wholesome as those belonging to Charles
Manson, the serial killer who is the punch line of the movie's only funny
joke. The continuous preaching of violence as not only a means to an end but
a positive trait as well is simply inexcusable. This is especially
distressing given that the production targets a young and very
impressionable teenage audience with several cameos by professional
wrestlers and a PG-13 rating.
When in doubt about something, the movie's main characters ask themselves a
simple question: `What would King do?' (Not to be mistaken with the much
funnier question asked of Brian Boitano in South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.) So what would the idiotic King do? Hmmm. . .have the brains to see a
different movie.

Walking into "Ready to Rumble", the new film from Hollywood's biggest
goofball, David Arquette ("Scream", those annoying 1-800-call-ATT
commercials), I figured there were two possibilities for this movie. It was
going to be stupid, the previews had already given that much away. The
question now, was whether it was going to be the sort of stupid which you
can't help but chuckle at, or the just plain moronic kind. It turns out that
the movie has a little of both. While there are a lot of faults, there are
also one or two really funny scenes and a few others you can't help but find
amusing no matter how low brow they might be. However, the film's biggest
problem is the premise itself. How can one make a movie that pokes fun at
professional wrestling when wrestling already pokes fun at itself?
Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) have only one great love in
their lives. This all consuming passion is professional wrestling, and
specifically worship for their idol, Jimmy "The King" King (Oliver Platt).
They have just obtained tickets to the latest match between The King and
Diamond Dallas Page (Page Falkinburg). They are horrified to find that
King's manager, Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), has rigged the match so
that King will not only lose, but will be ejected from the wrestling circuit
forever. Now Gordie and Sean have only one purpose in life: to get The King
his crown back. However, they soon discover that their idol may not be all
they thought he was, and professional wrestling may be *gasp* fake afterall!
When I said there are one or two really funny scenes in this movie I wasn't
kidding. Fortunately, there are enough mildly amusing scenes to make up for
this. The interesting thing is that, the best part of this movie isn't the
comedy, it's the massive wrestling match at the film's end. The problem with
this is that it's a long, and at times very dull, trip to that payoff.
Another problem is that while the majority of the jokes may fall flat, at
least the actors are trying their best to pull something out of them.
However, at other times the movie seems to be trying to convey some message
about wrestlers and their fans and this not only doesn't work, but seriously
detracts from the rest of the film. I suppose this is because anything
serious seems completely out of place in a movie this goofy.
As for the actors, I've never really cared for David Arquette. He may have
been somewhat entertaining in the "Scream" films, but I think this is
because Wes Craven kept him tightly reined in. Otherwise, he has a tendancy
to overact to the point where the audience expects him to rip out of the
screen and start bouncing off the walls. Scott Caan ("Boiler Room", "Black
and White") hasn't appeared in much till now, but he turns in a remarkably
restrained performance considering his co-star. As for Oliver Platt ("Lake
Placid"), whom I consider one of the better comic actors working in
Hollywood, he is woefully miscast as a professional wrestler. The problem
is, Platt is not particularly tall, rather overweight, and about as vicious
looking as a small dog. Being surrounded by real wrestlers, like Bill
Goldberg throughout the movie, only makes him look more ridiculous in this
role.
"Ready to Rumble" has a typical soundtrack for this type of movie. It's
filled with popular alternative music, and it was certainly a welcome change
from the constant rap soundtracks I've been hearing lately. Brian Robbins
("Varsity Blues") doesn't exactly seem to be directing this movie. He simply
seems to be allowing the actors to do whatever they feel like to try and get
a laugh out of Stephen Brill's ("The Mighty Ducks") rather weak script. I'm
not sure if this was a good idea, but keeping David Arquette under control
certainly couldn't have hurt the film. "Ready to Rumble" runs far too long
at 122 minutes, and should have been no more than 95. I'd recommend "Ready
to Rumble" to wrestling fans since they will most likely recognize a few
familiar faces and give it three out of five stars.

Okay, so here's kinda how the pitch must've gone down: "We get the guy who
directed VARSITY BLUES to make this movie about wrestling (cause it is just
like totally hot now!), slap in a couple of dumb teenage characters, like
that ultimate weirdo, David Arquette from those SCREAM movies and Scotty
Caan, cause he's got a great ass. Toss in a bit of sexual exploitation, via
the overly-curvaceous Rose McGowan, a soundtrack filled with bitchin' tunes
and all the shit and groin jokes that you could fit into ninety minutes, and
by golly, I think "the kids" will go for it!" Well, I ain't no kid, and I
ain't much into "rassling", but gosh darnit, this film was pretty funny.
PLOT:
Two goofy kids who worship their wrestling hero as a god believe themselves
to be his savior when their great champion falls from his reign.
CRITIQUE:
Stupid, crass, loud, juvenile, exploitative and most importantly...pretty
darn funny! No offense to any morons out there, but if you actually go into
this movie expecting anything but cool wrestling scenes, rockin' songs,
girls with big boobs, and another awesome shot of Scott Caan's ass, then
you're a bigger moron that anyone in this film. If on the other hand, you
liked Beavis & Butthead, you liked Bill & Ted's, and you liked, well,
Rocky...you will most likely enjoy this passable update of their respective
themes. That being established, let's see what was good and bad about the
movie. Good: The story is cute and actually convinces with a little heart in
the end. Good: The soundtrack is kickass, although whoever decided that it
was a better idea to play the remake version of Twisted Sister's classic
anthem "We're Not Gonna Take It", as opposed to the original, should
literally be slapped silly. Good: Arquette, Caan and even the wrestlers all
come out smelling like shit, which in this movie...is a good thing! You'll
get what I mean by the 12th caca joke in this film. Honestly though, they
were all pretty good in their respective roles.
Good: The wrestling scenes were really cool, only I wish they had included
more of them...pretty exciting stuff! Ultimately, the last twenty minutes of
the film packed the most punch. Good: Martin Landau's cameo as an old time
wrestler. Damn funny! Bad: Not enough Rose McGowan! It's one thing to
include her and the Nitro girls as blatant exploitative fodder, but at least
if you're gonna go that far...let's see more of them, dammit! Bad: Some
jokes work, but others fall flat. It's up and down on that count, with no
major laugh out scenes either. Bad: I did enjoy Oliver Platt's drunken Elvis
performance, but I generally love his humor, so felt a little disappointed
in that he didn't get many better lines. Having said all that, this film is
not to be taken seriously. It does provide a small emotional touch in the
end, which I thought was nice, but I seriously doubt any movie critic (or
adult for that matter) over the age of 40 will enjoy any of this shite!
Unless of course, you don't mind seeing an umpteen set of people getting
kicked in the groin over and over, enjoy loud rock music, don't mind
watching two morons prance around the big screen, and...yes, of
course...love that rassling!!
Incidentally, I've always felt like wrestling fans and soap opera fans had a
lot in common. They both enjoy watching over-the-top spectacles, most never
admit to being an actual fan and they all seem to get really involved in the
most absurd plot twists, no matter how ridiculous! The only difference that
I've noticed between the two is that wrestling's got more sweaty men...but
even that, is pretty similar.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Rose McGowan was born in Florence, Italy and raised in a commune for the
Children of God cult (the same folks who had River Phoenix's parents in the
early years). She later moved to Oregon, and ran away from home when she was
14, after her parents checked her into a drug rehab program, even though she
wasn't - she insists to this day - doing drugs. She lived on the streets for
a while, and eventually moved to California, where writer/director Gregg
Araki met her outside of a gym and cast her in THE DOOM GENERATION. She is
now married to weirdo rocker Marilyn Manson.
David Arquette's dad Lewis also makes an appearance in this movie. He also
played Chief Louis Hartley in SCREAM 2 (7/10).
Scott Caan stand 5'5, is the son of actor James Caan and apparently likes to
stand around naked in his cowboy boots, since he does so in both this movie
and VARSITY BLUES.
Ahmet Zappa, son of the late weird rocker Frank Zappa, plays the convenience
store owner in this movie.
Some of the wrestlers with appearances in this film include Goldberg,
Diamond Dallas Page, Sting, Sid Vicious, Juventud Guerrera, Kidman, Konnan,
Rey Mysterio Junior, Disco Inferno and Bam Bam Bigelow.
Screenwriter Steven Brill is quite the renaissance man. He's a writer, he
wrote the three MIGHTY DUCK movies, an actor, he had parts in all three
MIGHTY DUCK films as well as BIG DADDY (7/10) and THE WEDDING SINGER, and
heck why the hell not...he will also be directing Adam Sandler in his next
comedy flick entitled LITTLE NICKY.
Brian Robbins, the man who directed this film and last year's teen success
VARSITY BLUES (7/10), was once an actor himself. He is probably best
remembered for his role as Eric on TV's "Head of the Class". That's
right...he was the "cool" nerd.
Stay tuned at the end of this movie for some pretty funny outtakes.

Cast: David Arquette (Gordie Boggs), Oliver Platt (Jimmy King), 
Scott Caan (Sean Dawkins), Bill Goldberg (himself), Diamond Dallas Page 
(himself),
Joe Palitaliano (Titus Sinclair), Steve Borden (Sting), Rose McGowan 
(Sasha),
Martin Landau (Sal).
Let me begin this review by saying that I am a huge fan of professional 
wrestling, and
I'm not ashamed to say it. I'm not too fond of Ted Turner's World 
Championship Wrestling,
however, and after this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie they 
have put out, I have 
even less respect for them.
Gordie Boggs (Arquette, aptly cast as a moron, as he is one) and his 
best friend Sean Dawkins 
(Scott Caan. The son of James Caan should not be reduced to garbage like 
this!) are two losers from 
Wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends, who look up to World 
Championship Wrestling champion 
Jimmy King (a terribly casted Oliver Platt), as he is everything they 
are not. They finally 
get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil, 
ruthless promoter Titus 
Sinclair (a wasted Palitaliano, in a role originally meant for real-life 
WCW President Eric 
Bischoff, whose name was written all over the role!). Gordie and Sean 
track down King in 
Atlanta and discover that he is not really the English king the WCW 
writers created for him, 
but a drunken, ignorant Southerner who is as irritated by these two 
lunkheads as Bob Newhart 
was by Larry, Darryl, and Darryl. They sneak him back onto WCW TV, after 
which Sinclair 
agrees to book him in a steel cage match in Las Vegas at WCW's next 
pay-per-view, against 
his rival, Diamond Dallas Page. If he wins, King gets his title and his 
career back, plus one 
million dollars. 
WCW President Eric Bischoff, knowing his promotion was desperate with 
bad writing and ratings
skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior World Wrestling Federation, 
came up with the idea
for this movie hoping it would save WCW. He was then fired and rehired 
two months ago, but by the 
time he'd left, they had already been contracted to do the film, and 
Bischoff could not play Sinclair 
(which, in itself, is for the best, as anybody who has seen him on WCW 
programming knows that 
Bischoff is NO actor!). The characters of Gordie and Sean show you 
exactly what Eric Bischoff
thinks of his fans. He thinks of them as young, dumb pathetic idiots who 
will believe anything 
that will be put out in front of them is real. That is why he doesn't 
take the fans into 
consideration when he books a Nitro or a pay-per-view. I have news for 
you, Eric: NO wrestling fan in
this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling 
isn't for show, unless they 
are four years old. This is 2000, you know, not 1985. Bischoff will try 
to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy, but I have no 
doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic, ROCKY-style
film (which it probably should have been. Professional wrestling is 
ridiculed enough as it is, why 
should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy?), Gordie and 
Sean would have been
portrayed in the same light.
Anybody who has seen the documentary WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS, documenting 
WWF owner Vince McMahon's
double-crossing of Bret Hart, will probably realize via the reviews and 
previews of READY TO 
RUMBLE, that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the 
poor man's Wayne and
Garth thrown in for comedic affect. You can tell Titus Sinclair is 
supposed to poke fun at
Vince, but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that Sinclair is more 
inspired by Bischoff
than Vince, and that Vince did what he had to do to Bret Hart. All of 
these aspects of the film,
needless to say, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan.
Another thing I found disturbing about the film was the romance between 
Gordie and Nitro Girl
Sasha (The lovely Rose McGowan). Wouldn't it have been easier to bring 
something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only 
working on Gordie at Sinclair's insistance? I hate that cliche!
The World Wrestling Federation would have made a better film. They are 
the promotion everyone
cares about, they are winning the ratings, they have better wrestlers, 
and they take their fans
into consideration and don't treat fans like morons. So, Vince, how 
about a movie?

Scott Caan (Sean Dawkins), Bill Goldberg (himself), Joe Palitaliano (Titus
Sinclair), Rose McGowan (Sasha), Diamond Dallas Page (himself) Steve Borden (Sting), Martin 
Landau (Sal) and several other WCW guys.
Crew: Directed by Brian Robbins, written by Steven Brill, Executive produced by Eric Bischoff.
Let me just start this review off by saying I am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for 
fifteen years. I am not too fond of Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling, however, and
I am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie 
tonight.
The plot concerns two losers named Gordie Boggs (David Arquette, aptly cast as a neandrathal) and
Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe
everything they see on WCW Monday Nitro is something more than a flashy show. When they
finally get to see their hero, WCW World Champion Jimmy King (played by Oliver Platt.
I personally would have gotten a wrestler to play King), he ends up getting screwed over 
by evil promoter Titus Sinclair (A wasted Palitaliano, in a role originally meant for
real-life WCW President Eric Bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later, and 
if anyone reads this who knows Bischoff, they will agree with me that the role of Sinclair 
had his name written all over it), they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his 
title back. When they find him, they discover in horror that Jimmy King's real life is 
nothing like it is on WCW TV. King is a drunken Atlanta native rather than an English king. 
After convincing King that they don't care that his persona isn't real, Gordie and Sean
sneak him back onto WCW Monday Nitro, after which Sinclair agrees to book him in a main
event steel cage match for the WCW title and his job back in Las Vegas at WCW's 
pay-per-view. 
Gee, whiz, there are so many things wrong with this movie, I don't know where to begin.
Yes, I do...
1. The characters of Gordie and Sean show you what Eric Bischoff, WCW President who thought 
up this project, thinks of wrestling fans. He thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do 
seriously. He actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be
taken seriously. I got news for you, Eric: NOBODY above the age of four is dumb enough for
that, this is 2000, you know, not 1985! I know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying
it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is, because that's how big an ego Bischoff has.
2. There was a documentary made in 1998, Wrestling with Shadows, that documented the owner of 
the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon's screwing Bret "The Hitman" Hart out of the
title. This movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's
Wayne and Garth thrown in. Eric Bischoff is trying to make Vince McMahon look bad with the
character of Titus Sinclair, but any wrestling fan knows Titus is more like Bischoff than
McMahon, and that Vince did what he had to do to Bret Hart.
3. The movie's main wrestler, Jimmy King, has an English king gimmick and the audience cheered
big for him. No wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age,
we want bad asses today!
4. Why make this a comedy, instead of an emotional, ROCKY-style drama? I know wrestling
isn't a sport, but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally
makes it in the end.
5. In the movie, Gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with Nitro Girl Sasha (the lovely
Rose McGowan. What she sees in that freak Marilyn Manson I'll never understand), only
to find that she has hospitalized King's trainer for Sinclair. Wouldn't it have been
easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy
cliche? I hate that.
6. Last, but certainly not least, there was not one single moment in this movie that I
could not predict would happen, nor did I laugh once either.
The World Wrestling Federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie,
for these reasons:
1. They're the better promotion.
2. They have better and younger talent, performers and wrestlers.
3. They give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots.
4. They're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about.
5. Simply put, they could make a movie a hundred times better, and they could do
a wrestling movie the right way.
The only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end. And if
I spoiled it for you, good, I saved you from wasting seven dollars.

 It's about time Hollywood made a picture about a flabby, mutton-chopped
bumpkin whose legions of brain-dead fans call him `the King.'  No, I'm
not talking about Elvis, but rather Jimmy King, beloved World
Championship Wrestling title-holder and owner of the longest winning
streak in the history of the sport.  He's also the `People's Champion'
(how'd I miss that election?) and the hero of Ready To Rumble's two
protagonists, who watch in horror as their idol is shafted out of his
title as the film opens.
Gordie Boggs (David Arquette, Scream 3) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan,
Black & White) star as septic truck workers in Lusk, Wyoming.  In
between sucking `ass juice' (their term) out of port-a-potties and
residential septic systems, Gordie and Sean eat, sleep and breathe
wrestling, a sport they insist is real.  They each wear WWKD (What Would
King Do?) bracelets and live for the high point of their week -
television's WCW Monday Nitro Live.
The dunderheaded duo drive their crap-wagon to Cheyenne to watch King
(Oliver Platt, Bicentennial Man) battle Diamond Dallas Page.  Little do
they (or King) know that behind the scenes, WCW boss Titus Sinclair (Joe
Pantoliano, Black & White) has arranged for King to be mercilessly
beaten and permanently kicked out of his league.  After DDP thrashes
King, the teary-eyed trailer-trash crash their turd-truck and, believing
that the accident is somehow related to King's defeat, begin a quest to
track down their portly hero to convince him to demand a rematch with
DDP.
Gordie and Sean find King and get the rematch  a triple-steel-cage
match in Vegas.  They also find him a trainer in a former wrestler
played by the oddly cast Martin Landau (EdTV).  Things proceed as
expected right through the end with the big wrestling finale - not so
much of a revenge match between the current and former champs, but also
a more subtle battle between King and Sinclair over who was responsible
for popularizing the sport.
Rumble is lewd and crude from the get-go, with its opening scene
featuring Gordie sticking a finger up his own pooper to con a Slurpee
out of a convenience store employee played by the perpetually annoying
Ahmet Zappa (webRiot).  The film, directed by Brian Robbins (Varsity
Blues) and written by three-time Mighty Ducks scribe/star Steven Brill,
is jam-packed with a bunch of modern rock tracks that were, like, so
totally five minutes ago.  Arquette does a good job of screaming and
acting like a retard, but is it really acting?
I guess I can understand the appeal of what is essentially an hour-long,
action-oriented sitcom, but in my mind wrestling's extravagant costumes,
snug-fitting leotards and carefully applied make-up practically screams
`Stand back, Laverne  I'm coming out of the closet!'  I have a feeling
that wrestling fans probably look down on the sissies that watch figure
skating, even though they too feature the same dopey get-ups.  I'm not
sure which was scarier - the wide-eyed mouth-breathers around me that
whispered `Sting' when the popular wrestler appeared on the screen, or
the fact that Rumble was so bad that I couldn't even enjoy Zappa being
violently thrown through a glass door at the end of the film.
In addition to portraying wrestling as `real,' Rumble also does a
horrible job of casting Platt in the role of a wrestling champion.  He
looks like he struggles to get out of bed in the morning, so how are we
supposed to believe he can beat these gargantuan steroid junkies?  The
film is a colossal waste of time but, if you insist on going, make sure
you stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits.
1:49 - PG-13 for adult language, crude humor, sexual content, brief
nudity and wrestling violence

Is it possible to parody a sport like wrestling, which is itself nothing
but a parody?
In READY TO RUMBLE, director Brian Robbins, working from a hilarious
script by Steven Brill, answers that question in the affirmative with
the most outlandishly funny film since THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.
Aiming every shot for the bleachers, the cast and crew hit one homerun
after another.  With one over-the-top sequence after another, they make
a film that you'll undoubtedly find either greatly awful or awfully
great.  The vast majority of our packed audience hooted and hollered and
was clearly in the latter category, but there were a few walkouts,
proving the film will not have quite universal appeal.
Gordie Boggs, played in a scene-stealing performance by David Arquette,
and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) are two Port-a-Potty cleaners with an
obsession for the sport of wrestling.  They worship their hero, Jimmy
King, with a religious fervor.  King, the heavy-weight champion of the
world, is going to be in town tonight to defend his crown against
Diamond Dallas Page, who plays himself in the movie as do many other
"real" wrestlers.  (The recent, fascinating documentary, BEYOND THE MAT,
chronicled the lives of some of these wrestlers.)
Oliver Platt (BULWORTH), in an inspired bit of unobvious casting, plays
the king of the wrestling world, Jimmy King.
When we first meet King, dressed in cheap medieval robes, he enters the
ring to a burst of fireworks as surprising music blasts out.  More on
that later.  His bombastic speech pumps up his adoring fans in the
crowd.  "Do you want to see me make Diamond Dallas Page into one of my
maids in waiting?" he bellows to a roaring audience.
What King doesn't know is that the slimy producer, Titus Sinclair (Joe
Pantoliano), has secretly told Page not to follow the script.  Page is
to cheat by actually hurting King, who is an alcoholic and not the
world's bravest athlete.  Titus thinks King has gotten too big for his
britches so he wants him taken down permanently, which Page does without
too much trouble.
The movie's second act has our doofus duo out on a quest to find their
hero and help him get the rematch that they think he deserves.  Along
the way they find that everything about King and the sport isn't what
they thought.  "It's a circus show with dancing clowns," King tries to
explain to them, but they won't listen.  They are going to get their man
in shape for the big challenge against Page, no matter what it takes.
One of their secret weapons is Sal Bandini (Martin Landau), a wrestler
of the old school when the sport involved real strength and skill.  A
man who is down, but never out, Sal barks out slogans like, "Lesson
number 1: the possum ain't dead till it's scraped off the road." Sal is
the real McCoy that the King needs.
Sasha (Rose McGowan), the big-breasted member of the cheerleaders known
as the Nitros, seems to be just what the over-sexed-but-under-loved
Gordie needs.  When he offers to show her a few moves on their big date,
the sequence leads to an unusual "sex" scene.
The last act is, of course, the big match.  It is as side-splittingly
funny as the rest of the picture, which produces an uncountable number
of uncontrollable laughs.
The movie's secret ingredient is its unusual choice of music.  What sort
of music comes to mind when you think of a bunch of sweaty guys trying
to pulverize each other as a form of entertainment?  Bet Richard Wagner
didn't come to mind.  Well, it did to the makers of READY TO RUMBLE, and
proves a perfect match to this over-the-top production.
So what music does King use as his theme song and as his equivalent of
the President's "Hail to the Chief?"  Whenever King makes his entrance,
the symphony's trumpets blare out with Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the
Common Man."  Perfect.
READY TO RUMBLE runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for language, crude humor,
sexuality, brief male rear nudity and wrestling violence.  But, it's a
hard PG-13.  The movie would be fine for teenagers.

Starring-David Arquette, Scott Caan, Oliver Platt, Rose McGowan,
Diamond Dallas Page, Bill Goldberg, Joe Pantoliano and Martin Landau
Director-Brain Robbins
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Warner Brothers - 04/00
An 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch, wearing
tight-fitting leather, as she cheers on her favorite TV wrestler by
calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'. Two men messily eat fast food as
their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them. And roughly 17
people are booted in the crotch. Welcome to `Ready to Rumble'. Judging
from the fact that potty-mouth Adam Sandler is the reigning box-office
comedy champion, you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that
yes, there is an audience for this sort of thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I weep for society.
Mind you, when executed with style and comic ingenuity, jokes like an
alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel (`There's Something About
Mary') and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea (`Dumb and
Dumber') can be extremely funny. Unfortunately, `Ready to Rumble' is not
being helmed by the Farrelly brothers, nor is it bolstered by a script
that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or
inspired. `Ready to Rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of
professional wrestling.... which, in fact, sounded like a fine concept
for a goofball comedy.  But director Brian Robbins and screenwriter
Steven Brill handcuff themselves, and limited to a stampede of asinine,
humdrum bathroom humor, basically the only thing they manage is to evoke
memories of Pauly Shore and `Bio Dome'.
Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) take pride
in being hardcore WCW wrestling fanatics. By day, they transport raw
sewage. By night (particularly on Nitro' Monday), they pay homage to
their personal hero and savior - Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), the
undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community. With two
tickets to an upcoming Nitro performance, Gordie and Sean are psyched
about witnessing The King defend his title first-hand. But unscrupulous
boxing kingpin Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano, sporting long hair and
cowboy boots) has other plans. Sinclair is plotting to have Diamond
Dallas Page (playing himself) pummel The King into the tarp, thereby
dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a
bewildered auditorium full of fans. Gordie and Sean are shocked, rioting
madly while arguing `this isn't even a Pay-Per View event!!' They take
it upon themselves to track The King down and supply the encouragement
essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt. Along the
way, you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well.
You may find something to like in `Ready to Rumble' if a) you are a
rasslin' aficionado yourself, or b) you are a dedicated fan of the
lowest of low-brow comedies. I welcome low-brow humor with open arms -
that is, if its fresh and resourceful. `Rumble' is nothing but a sloppy,
frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation. The first
half-hour is the ultimate test of patience. Luckily, the simple-minded
events pick up steam, particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling
action. Director Robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and
excitement of football in `Varsity Blues', and when in the ring, he does
professional work. But the violence is too excessive. Having the fake
soap opera of WCW wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back
unfortunate memories of Owen Hart's tragic accident just last year,
especially with one character's dive during a cage match. This is not
something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of. Outside the wrestling
action, the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the
term scattershot', while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity
scale of 1 to 10, with Brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from
`diddly' to `boob' and so on. The final tally: I chuckled a few times,
groaned a lot, and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving Martin
Landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for
105.
Casting-wise, `Ready to Rumble' is an odd duck. Oliver Platt as a
champion wrestling figure? He's perhaps a bit chunky, but fellow
wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty', which
dampens the blow I suppose. Rose McGowan is fully disposable as a sultry
WCW cheerleader (`The Nirto-est of the Nitro girls,' proclaims Gordie),
but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers Goldberg, `Macho
Man' Randy Savage and Sting (among others). WCW fans are sure to
appreciate these. Others... well, won't. I found merit in David
Arquette's bountiful energy as Gordie, which brings me to my
finishing.... ahhh.... `praise' for the film: in `Ready to Rumble', I
have discovered something even more annoying than Arquette's `AT&T'
television commercials. Now there's a low blow for you.

      Ready to Rumble is not a masterpiece in film; I have a problem even
regarding it as a film. It's more of a show, a big commercial for Ted
Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The movie is almost entirely
about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the WCW like Diamond Dallas Page,
Goldberg, and Sting.
      The story is very minimal and basic. There are these two guys, Gordy
(David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan). They are two twenty-something wrestling
fans from Wyoming. When they go to a live event for the big match up, there
favorite wrestler Jimmy King (Oliver Platt) is defeated and his career is
announced to be over by the mean commissioner Titus (Joe Pantoliano). Gordy and
Sean decide to go on a quest to find Jimmy and bring him back to the top and
defeat the evil Titus' plans. On the way, they meet some people, have some
fun, and clean up some port-o-potties. Sounds great huh, well it's not. 
      The movie makes many attempts at humor, only a few of them work. The
jokes that make you laugh, however, do not outnumber the film's many duds.
There is a funny repertoire between Arquette and a convenience store cashier
played by Ahmet Zappa. The cashier is very mean to Arquette so Arquette Dreams
of ways to get him back. I especially enjoyed one version in which they have a
wrestling match and Arquette's tag team partner is 'Macho Man' Randy
Savage. They wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body
slammed on the floor. The other good part of the film is the sexual
confrontation between Arquette and Rose McGowan. McGowan plays Sasha the head
Nitro Girl, the cheerleaders of the WCW. She becomes attracted to Gordy and
they have some nice, funny scenes together especially one scene in which
Arquette calls McGowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly
into the face. 
      Now what didn't work in this movie? That would be the rest of it. The
flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets. The two lead
characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the
truck, the excrements spill all over the road. It's not funny; it's pathetic
and brainless. The film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their
wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way. I watch it for entertainment
and I would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the
movie. The main characters in the film actually get to wrestle, like that would
happen to any fan, especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back
onto set. Also, I wondered how they got into the backstage so easily; they just
walked right in. 
      I like wrestling. I watch it at home and laugh. It's continuously funny
and has great characters otherwise I wouldn't watch it. This movie wasn't
even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on TV. The only fun I had in the
movie was pointing out the wrestlers I knew. The funny thing was that many of
the WCW featured wrestlers like Saturn and Chris Benoit have left WCW for more
money but are still featured in the film prominently. The movie was too
dim-witted to be funny. It is possibly the most useless and under-developed
film ever. A recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film,
Detroit Rock City. That movie was interesting, well done and continuously funny
unlike this film. The acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you
laugh. 
      Now that the Scream trilogy is over, Arquette has nothing else to do so
he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-CALL-ATT
ads. At least he has a hot wife in Courtney Cox. He's in the funny parts of
the film but there aren't enough to make him look good.  The music was bad
also feature such overplayed tunes as Kid Rock's "Bawitdaba" and "Cowboy".
Martin Landau has a great cameo as a classic, hard-nosed wrestling trainer
named Sal that whips the King back into shape to regain his throne. 
      Script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made
with a couple of scribblings on a napkin. A fan of the wrestlers who are
featured in the film probably wrote it. At times the movie even tries to show
wrestling as real. The wrestlers form alliances, go to people's houses and
beat them up. It's utterly ridiculous. The whole film was a wasteful,
dumfounding experience. 
     The movie was made to pay homage to the fans, telling them things that
made wrestling, not the wrestlers. The wrestlers are making more money to make
a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a
potty-humor movie. The WCW sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour
commercial to watch it. If you're going to watch wrestling watch WWF, it's
actually entertaining. The wrestling is betters, they're funnier, more
diverse, and have better entrance themes. Oh and the girls are hotter. Is this
what movies have become, 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see?
Don't waste your money.

Rated PG-13: sexual and crude humor, language, some nudity.
Starring: David Arquette, Scott Caan, Rose McGowan and a slew of WCW wrestlers.
Directed by: Brian Robbins
Well lets see...I'm not quite sure how to review this film, based on its
laughter factor. Well yeah I can, it's not funny. Ok so I laughed one time
which warranted the 1/2 star, but other than that I sat in my seat wondering
when this POS would be over, (which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed
like forever!). In fact, this could be the un-funniest movie I've seen in a
long time, if not the un-funniest. Let me be the first to say "Ready to Rumble"
is a huge disappointment.
Long time wrestling lovers (David and Scott) dream of making it to the WCW, and
watching Jimmy King wrestle. That is their hero of course, whom is kicked out
of the WCW. Well here is where the plot thickens (lol): the two wish to rescue
The King, and put him back into the WCW but not that easily, because they are
being tampered with by many people who are out to get them, while David's
father wants him to become a police officer, and Scott is a loser who has to
with the help of David clean out Johnny On the Spots. What a plot eh?
"Ready to Rumble" is one of those films that tries to be funny, but sadly fails
miserably, everything in the film is imcomprehinsable, and even the trailer
wasn't funny. The actors are dull, the script awful, and the plot which there
isn't much of....really annoying. I'm not quite sure how great actors like
these, and very funny actors too, are given such a lame script, and directed in
such a childish manner, that I wonder if Hollywood is ever gonna make good
films these days.
This review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't
much going for the film, if anything at all. Only one big laugh is in the film,
which isn't all that hilarious. I sat in my chair wondering with this 107
(!!!!!) minute "comedy" was going to be over, and sadly it went on forever. I'm
not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste,
but believe me you, it is.

Man oh man, this movie had me laughing so hard, tears were running down the
creases of my smile-swollen cheeks. I was just one big baby balling my eyes
out. Now I'm not saying it was one-hunderd-precent, whoop-*ss,
neck-breaking, knee-slapping fun - but a swift kick to the gonads leaves a
lasting impression.
In the spirit of "Dumb and Dumber" (mock me if you will, but I loved that
film!) and more recently "Waterboy," "Ready to Rumble" brings back lovable
idiots to the screen. Stocky sparkplug Scott Caan, who played the charming
beer-minded jock in "Varsity Blues" is given more room to show his acting,
wrestling and funnyboner finesse. ("Blues" was a fine flick as a matter of
fact, though not especially funny.) David Arquette is Scott's "Dumber" in
this silly, innocently heart-warming mockery of a sport that is a mockery
already. (A spoof of a spoof - is that a double negative?)
Scott and David worship wrestling czar Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), and come
to his rescue after he looses his title as well as his self-respect.
Immediately following a few wince-able opening seconds, a surreal wrestling
rumble erupts in a small town convenient store, bringing the first of many
shouts of laughter from this cheering crowd. The sequence as with the other
wrestling scenes are filmed aptly, every power hit will leave you gasping.
Martin Landau even makes an appearance as body-flipping wrestling guru.
But the plot is broader than just rasslin'. David's dad is a hard guy cop
who pistol whips his wussy son into obedience. His reply to David's wimpy
desire to follow his dream, "Charles Manson followed his dream, Joseph
Stalin, Michael Bolton..." There were many other hard hitting punch lines
that I scribbled down, but admittedly they lie rather limp on canvas when
not brought to life by these talented actors and filmmakers. (Makes you
wonder how this script got sold.) In fact, the scene where King returns to
make peace with his estranged wife and kid, had me down for the count in
uncontrollable laughter. After that, it didn't matter that the ending went
more silly than funny or that a fistful of other punch lines failed to set
the teeth a-chattering.
"Rumble" is as funny as a van full of nuns singing Van Halen's "Running with
the Devil." If you love this kind of thing, this is just the kind of thing
you'll love.
