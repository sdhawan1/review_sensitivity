   We all know how automation--a form of robotics, if you will--can
make a difference in our lives.  The I.B.M. tech-help phone line
tells us that our call is important to them and proves it by playing
a half hour of Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" while we wait for the
attention of a mere mortal.  We wheel our S.U.V. into the car
wash and watch as large arms reach out to apply soap, water
and wax to our vehicle and brush up our advanced transportation
without the need for people to do much more than push some
buttons.  An invisible hand reaches out to pick out the pins in the
local bowling alley which we have maliciously knocked down as
we pitch strike after strike.  Even the very car that we get
polished up without the need for the intervention of people is put
together by robots.  What can we expect robotics to do in the
decades that lie ahead in our new century?
   In a sci-fi film which marries the detached, epic vision of
Stanley Kubrick to the sentimental child-centered themes of
Steven Spielberg, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence," shows us in an
awe-inspiring way how robots can be used to help us emotionally
as well as physically.  In a world that finds love in short supply, it
was only a matter of time before some scientific genius would
transcend the current rage of cloning by creating a mechanical
child equipped without the strength needed to assemble a car but
with the more important vitality of love.  As that scientist,
Professor Hobby (William Hurt) tells an assemblage of his peers
at the corporation of which he is the creative director about the
importance of receiving affection: "God made Adam to love Him." 
In the brief opening moments of this fairly long film, anyone in the
audience with the slightest grasp of literature or of sentimental
filmmaking will realize that the a child-robot created with the
ability to give love will change not only the mother who craves
this affection but the boy himself (or itself).
   "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" was the final project conceived by
Stanley Kubrick to be screened some time after what became the
late, great director's swan song, "Eyes Wide Shut."  Kubrick had
taken his good friend Steven Spielberg into his confidence to
discuss a story about an advanced technology, one which would
blend science (the creation of robots to do jobs that human
beings would prefer not to do) and humanity (the creation of
robots to furnish emotional warmth to those who choose to buy
them).  After Kubrick's death, Spielberg took over the project
which one producer calls an attempt by him to "embrace and pay
homage to Stanley."  To those in the audience who are familiar
with works such as  "E.T." and "Jurassic Park"--the latter
focusing on the grandchildren of paleontologists who tag along
with the scientists to inspect an island amusement park not
realizing that anything can go wrong--the picture that now
emerges looks mostly like Spielberg's, but not without the
insistent entrace of Kubrick's motifs.  
   A fifty-minute sequence takes place largely within the
comfortable suburban home of a young couple, Henry Swinton
(Sam Robards) and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor).  Since
their only son, a fatally ill Martin (Jake Thomas) has been
cryogenically frozen pending such time as a cure can be found
for his disease, they long for another boy to love.  Their dream
comes true as Henry surprises his wife by buying an android
named David (Haley Joel Osment) from the scientist Dr. Hobby
(William Hurt) during a period of declining resources and limited
land space causing the government to restrict the growth of
human population.  Like Pinocchio--which is one among many
fables that are called upon to inform the movie's motifs--David
decides that in return for the love he is giving, he wants love in
return. The only way to get this affection is to become a real boy
himself.  He will ultimately devote quite a bit of time to this quest.
   This initial segment in what is obviously a sci-fi tale is
surprisingly the most compelling despite its sappiness, perhaps
because after David is introduced to his new owners, and later to
a now-recovered "brother" Martin, Mr. Spielberg appears to take
a long break, handing the movie over to the Kubrick touch.  The
middle segment of what is really a trilogy, all centered on David,
is cold, detached, unemotional, as we are introduced to two
locations that are futuristic but not representing the sort of
prospect that most of us would welcome.  (Some spoilers follow.) 
After David is tearfully abandoned by Monica together with a
cuddly robotic bear named Teddy (voice of Jack Angel) which
steals every scene in which he appears, he is transported to a
couple of ticky-tacky locations that only Mad Max could love.  He
meets with and ultimately saves the life of Gigolo Joe (Jude
Law), a robot designed to give massages to the ladies and then
some, an automaton who tells his customers that after a session
with him they will never again want a real man.  He does not
even need a CD player to help seduce the women.  He merely
shakes his head to one side and out comes romantic music. 
When a robot-hating Luddite named Lord Johnson-Johnson
(Brendan Gleeson) emcees a killing field within a stadium that
could have been the arena for "Gladiator"--shooting the trapped
robots out from cannons into fiery deaths (which could give the
kiddies attending the movie nightmares)--David leads Joe to
safety and continues his odyssey in search of the Blue Fairy,
who like the Wizard of Oz is said to be able to fulfill his dream
and turn him into other than he now is.
   There are numerous references to fables in addition to The
Wizard of Oz and Pinocchio, some self-referential, as Spielberg
winks at the audience challenging us to catch them.  One place is
called "Strangelove's" while the mayhem in Lord Johnson-
Johnson's emporium reminds us of "A Clockwork Orange."  The
execution of the obsolete robots calls to mind the termination of
people over 30 years old in "Logan's Run," while the general
concept often recalls "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
   "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is photographed by Janusz
Kaminski for the most realistically, showing a future that aside
from the robots is not so much more advanced than our own era
and, in fact, given the research and results of cloning
experiments is hardly beyond the grasp of audience imagination. 
The car which Monica uses to take David away, to dump him into
the countryside like an unwanted pet but with a warning to avoid
corporate employees who are instructed to destroy trashed toys,
is a cool vehicle but in no way one that cannot now be designed
if the powers-that-be wanted to take a leap forward by a decade
of so.  Even the scene of New York, now submerged because of
melting ice caps, is recognizable by the Chrysler building which
majestically keeps its head out of the water defying the elements,
and considerable attention has been given to produce a
digitalized milieu inhabited by a citizenry alternately brutalized by
the spectacle of robots being malicious destroyed while some,
like the scientist Dr. Hobby, remain and compassionate.
   Haley Joel Osment, twelve years old at the time of the filming,
has lost some of the cuteness that made him a compelling figure
in "The Sixth Sense," and in fact the movie was put on the fast
track to be complete in twenty weeks instead of the full year that
was originally planned because this wonderful young man is
quickly showing signs of physical maturity.  He remains an
effective center for the story, showing more depth than even the
Australian actress Frances O'Connor in the role of the mother--
whose emotional depth consisted of being either teary-eyed or
ambivalent.
   By the time we are taken to the final scene, which brings us to
a civilization two millennia ahead inhabited by figures looking as
though they could be at home on Venus, we may not be blamed
for wondering whether this craggy but generally imaginative and
visually splendid and mature picture has a single, all-embracing
motif.  John Williams's music is annoyingly ubiquitous if varied
but does not provide a clue to the Kubrick-Spielberg design. 
Nonetheless "A.I." is not a picture to ignore or pass up.  This is
sci-fi in the seasoned, deliberately-paced spirit of "Contact" rather
than the absurdly childish productions such as the "Alien" series,
featuring a varied range of set designs, musical compositions,
situations, and moods.

"The real conundrum isn't to create a robot that can
love. It's getting a human to love it back."
Starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances
O'Connor, Sam Robards, William Hurt, Jack Thomas,
Brendan Gleeson and the voice of Jack Angel. Directed
by Steven Spielberg. Rated PG-13.
Everyone is talking about A.I. Artificial
Intelligence, and everyone wants to talk about it as a
collaboration between Steven Spielberg and the late
Stanley Kubrick. Though there are some interesting
points to be made on the subject, they have by now
been made elsewhere, and I'm not interested in
discussing it. The bizarre, upsetting, wonderful movie
stands on its own as a provocative masterpiece, that
rare piece of work with the courage to bewilder, be
misinterpreted and start arguments.
Like many, it took me two viewings to realize this. I
knew right away that I had seen something special, but
the film disturbed me so deeply that I looked for
flaws, and I found them. The second time, it was more
apparent that this is easily Spielberg's most mature,
most meticulous movie to date; what I perceived as
flaws were choices, not errors, and damn good ones in
retrospect.
A.I. begins with the familiar sight of crashing ocean
waves and narration by Ben Kingsley, who describes the
world after the melting of the polar ice caps. Major
cities, including New York, were drowned; thousands of
people starved to death. Strict population controls
were imposed by surviving governments. Humans became
increasingly dependant on mechas, robots that simulate
human appearance and behavior.
By now, Spielberg has already set the mood for at
least the first section of the film: chilling,
foreboding, the darkness of the subject matter
clashing with the sterile comfort of the futuristic
society it depicts; those expecting another E.T.
should already be disappointed. We fade to a
conference room, where Dr. Allen Hobby (William Hurt)
gives a speech on the prospects of building a robot
who can feel real human emotions, a robot child who
can love. Someone poses a question that Dr. Hobby is
unable to answer, one of the film's central themes: if
the robot genuinely loves its owner, what
responsibility does the human have towards the
machine? The answer isn't, as Roger Ebert
thoughtlessly wrote, "none." If we are responsible for
what we create, are we also responsible for the
emotions of a robot boy? After all, his feelings are
hardly more "simulated" than ours; they're all
electrical signals traveling through a network of
neurons.
Cybertronics, Inc. creates a prototype named David,
played here by Haley Joel Osment, and gives it to
Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), an employee, to try out.
He and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) already have
a son who is in a coma after an accident, evidently
beyond science's reach. Monica, understandably, has
trouble accepting a mecha replacement, and Henry
doesn't push her. David looks and acts like a real
boy, but not quite; there's something subtly off about
his behavior (for one thing, he never blinks). This
part of the film is icy and ominous, though you can't
put your finger on exactly why; this is the closest
Spielberg comes to channeling Kubrick.
David comes with an imprinting protocol, a sequence of
words that must be said to him that will seal his love
to his owner forever. If, after imprinting, the owner
decides not to keep the mecha, it must be returned to
its manufacturer for destruction. At first, Monica
doesn't like the idea; David creeps her out by
suddenly appearing everywhere she turns, and the idea
that this is a machine seems always to be in the back
of her mind. Then, almost impulsively, she imprints,
and, in an amazing scene, David calls her "mommy" for
the first time.
Martin regains consciousness. He's Henry and Monica's
"real son," and David isn't spared this information.
Martin sees him as just a cool toy to play with, but
when he sees that his mom is infatuated with this
fancy new "mecha," he sets out to make David seem like
a threat.
After being taunted by kids at Martin's birthday
party, David appeals to Martin for protection and, in
the midst of the chaos, drags him into the pool and
almost drowns him. The next day, under the guise of an
intimate drive through the country, Monica takes David
back to Cybertronics. Only she can't bear to destroy
this mecha that seems so lifelike. So she decides to
leave him in the woods with his talking teddy bear and
let him fend for himself.
This is where my emotions started to run amok. The
scene in the forest is so heartbreaking, so genuine in
its despair that were I a few decades older I may have
had to be wheeled away; I would have cried if I wasn't
so shellshocked both times I watched it. But the scene
is even more powerful when you ask why it was so
affecting. After all, David isn't a real boy, but a
machine. So isn't it like leaving a toaster in the
woods, or a microwave? This is the genius of
Spielberg's work here. He isn't going for pure
manipulation; he plays with your emotions and then
prods you to consider why you felt the way you did.
A.I. then shifts in tone completely, as David is
caught by a local "Flesh Fair," a "celebration of
life" in which robots are flamboyantly destroyed on
stage, under the guise of "destroying artificiality."
The head of the fair, played by Brendan Gleeson,
shouts that these mechas were made to replace humans,
and the film's ending proves him right.
David spends the rest of the movie searching for the
Blue Fairy, a character from Pinnochio, which he
overheard when Monica read it to Martin. He wants to
become a real boy so that his mommy will love him
again. His companions are Teddy and Gigolo Joe (Jude
Law), a single-minded, runaway lover robot. Joe was
Kubrick's idea, considerably toned down by Spielberg.
The film is insanely ambitious and brave. It dares to
regard the human race as a petty distraction in the
grand scheme of things, and to view existence as a
state of mind rather than flesh and blood. Why do we
claim to have a monopoly on consciousness and emotion?
If we make a computer program that learns, feels and
reasons, how do you distinguish it from the structure
of our brain which is similarly programmed by instinct
and genetics?
In his third act, Spielberg fearlessly jumps 2000
years into the future, with a denoument that combines
unabashed sentimentality with an undercurrent of
darkness. Critics who gripe that Spielberg compromised
Kubrick's vision with a trademark happy ending
couldn't be farther off the mark; the conclusion is
chilling, recalling Kubrick's own cryptic last act of
2001: A Space Oddyssey. No matter how you interpret
A.I.'s last few seconds, they are the result -- or the
continuation -- of a robot boy's dream, a dream that
could never have come true in the world that created
David.
A.I. is anchored by an amazing Haley Joel Osment, who
again brings with him the emotional maturity most
"adult" actors can only wish for. Jude Law, in his
showiest role to date, is by turns hilarious and
devastating as the troubled sexbot, and Frances
O'Connor gives a courageous performance in what's
likely to be one of the year's most despised roles.
I suppose it's not hard to see why American audiences
have resisted and rejected A.I., though it is
disheartening. It's Spielberg's most serious, most
profound, most adult film; it's also his strangest.
Moviegoers were confused by the daffy third act, and
hard-pressed to see the point of it all. If you had
that reaction, I think you should see it again; it's
amazing how much becomes clear on second viewing.
This is the kind of movie that stays with you. Weeks
after seeing it, I can't shake it. The image that has
haunted me the most isn't the shockingly cruel scene
in the woods, or the powerful conclusion, but Gigolo
Joe's simple, stunning statement of existence. "I am.
I was."

It's the time of mankind's distant future and all the worries and concerns
over global warming have come to a disastrous head. Much of Earth is
underwater and the governments have restricted the allowed human birthrate.
Robotics has taken a quantum leap in development and man has created a
replicant that can love. But, has man gone too far playing God? Find out in
Steven Spielberg's long awaited "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence."
There has been a hush, for months, over details about Spielberg's
involvement in what had been a longtime Stanley Kubrick project. The
reclusive Kubrick was taken by the concepts introduced in the 1969 sci-fi
short story by Brian Aldiss, Super Toys Last All Summer Long, and had been
developing his film treatment for some time prior to his death last year.
Friend and colleague Spielberg took over the mantle of the production,
developing the screenplay (from the screen story by Ian Watson) and
directing the effort. What we get is a mix of intents as the helmer tries
to be true to Kubrick's vision while deriving many parts of the film from
his own (Spielberg's) body of work.
A little boy, the son of Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam
Robards), is in a coma and there is little hope that he'll awaken. Monica
is despondent and growing increasingly withdrawn, forcing Henry to act
quickly and decisively. A brilliant robotics professor, Allen Hobby, has
developed his theory that robots, or Mechas, can be made to love and Henry
gets the first model, named David (Halley Joel Osment). When David is
brought into the Swinton household, Monica greats him with a scared
reluctance. As she grows used to the robo-boy, she invokes the imprint that
triggers his program to love. A semblance of normalcy comes back to their
home and all is well - for a while.
The miracle of modern science eventually finds a cure for the Swinton's
son, Martin (Jake Thomas), and he returns as the family alpha boy. While
Monica treats David as a real child, Martin understands that the Mecha is
little more than a super toy. The wily Martin soon figures out how to
confuse David into doing things he shouldn't, making his parents think that
the little robot is a danger to the family. Monica, instead of returning
David to the factory for destruction, decides the best course is to abandon
the boy in a spooky forest to fend for himself.
Part two of the tale shifts from family life to survival as David searches
for the one thing that he real wants - to be a real boy. This "Pinocchio"
theme drives David into the scrap heap world of discarded robots. He meets
Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a pleasure Mecha that can be anything a woman (and,
presumably, a man) wants him to be. Joe is very cool and takes David under
his wing. This part turns into a world straight out of "Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome" where robots, instead of men, are ravaged for public
entertainment. The final leg of David's journey takes on religious
overtones of resurrection and spiritual freedom as the little boy 'bot
finds "himself."
"A.I." is a complex film that strives to say a great deal. Messages of
love, loyalty, friendship and more are coupled with David's relentless
search, after his abandonment, for the Blue Fairy, who will change him into
a flesh and blood boy. Joining him in his quest is a present given by his
mom, a robotic bear named Teddy, as the stand-in for Jiminy Cricket. The
constant "Pinocchio" references and David's continued pleas to be a real
boy gives the film a derivative, rather than original, feel.
The F/X that animate Teddy and the rest of the robots (by Stan Winston
Studios) are very slick, as one can only expect in a Steven Spielberg
movie. But, as with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "A.I." gets too
full of itself and meaningfully meanders along, first in one direction,
then another until the until we get to the spiritually satisfying (for
Spielberg) end. For me, by the time the film was over, I had simply had
enough.
Robot movies have been around since "Metropolis" and the
robot-with-feelings concept has been with us from as far back as
"Pinocchio" - if you take that fairytale as a kind of low-tech robot story.
The idea also spawned such flicks as "Short Circuit," "Terminator 2" and,
one of my favorites, "Android," with Klaus Kinski chewing the scenery with
gusto. "A.I." represents a highbrow entry into the genre, with Spielberg's
typical rank sentimentality at its core.
On the acting front, the film belongs to young Osment, who is the single
point of focus throughout this unnecessarily long flick. Haley Joel is a
talented kid and does his best, building on the emotions that David
develops over time, but there is little arc to the development of the
character. Jude Law, in his limited time on screen, steals the show as the
sexy, pleasure-oriented Joe. With a hint of plasticity to his makeup,
giving him an artificial look, and his hip dance moves, the robotic gigolo
seems to be having a grand time. Brendan Gleeson offers little to his
character, Lord Johnson-Johnson, a kind of robotic gladiator owner/manager.
O'Connor, as the confused mom, is fine, but the rest of the cast, including
Robards and Hurt, are filling space and marking time.
Production values are commensurate with the obviously large budget that
Spielberg and company had to play with. Frequent Spielberg cinematographer,
Janusz Kaminski provides his deft camera talents effectively to the
challenging variety of film moods. John Williams does not, for once,
intrude his musical interpretations on the film, but you don't get anything
like the "Jaws" theme song either. Production design, by Rick Carter, comes
out of Spielberg's own body of work and others with direct takes from
"E.T.," "Close Encounters" and "Jaws," as well as the aforementioned "Mad
Max 3" and, frequently, "The Wizard of Oz."
"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is an anticipated event film that fails to
meet expectations. It's too long, by 20 minutes or more, and the story
meanders far too much to keep the viewer's interest. I give it a B-.

 A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Haley
Joel Osment, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, William Hurt, Sam Robards and
Frances O'Connor. Music by John Williams. Based on a short story by
Brian Aldiss. Based on a screenplay by Ian Watson. Screenplay by Steven
Spielberg. Directed by Spielberg. Rated PG-13
 It is easy to see why the late Stanley Kubrick believed Steven
Spielberg would be the perfect director for his A.I. Artificial
Intelligence, just as it is understandable why Spielberg was attracted
to the material.
 For here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home, an
outcast seeking family, themes very familiar from most of Spielbergís
body of work from Sugarland Express to Close Encounters of the Third
Kind to Empire of the Sun to Hook to Saving Private Ryan, naming just a
few examples.
 A.I. is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological
advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from
housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies. It is an era when robots
are treated merely as sophisticated appliances.
 The last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions,
and with the number of births limited by the government, many couples
are yearning for children.
 And Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has the solution. A robotic boy
named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is programmed to love. As a test,
David is placed with Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife, Monica
(Frances OíConnor). Their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen
until a cure can be found for his illness.
 The first third of A.I. deals with Davidís life with the Swintons and
how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son, Martin.
 Circumstances force David to be cut off from the Swintons. He is
abandoned and alone. David, highly influenced by the fairy tale,
Pinocchio, feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle Monicaís
love for him.
 The filmís second act follows Davidís search for The Blue Fairy, whom
he believes will be able to fulfill his wish. During these adventures he
meets and is helped by Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot who specializes in
sex.
 Spielberg is at his top form in this sequence, offering a brutal ěFlesh
Fairî where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement
of paying customers.
 Here, is where Kubrickís influence is strongly felt, as the movie
explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots. The savagery
conjures up images from the late directorís A Clockwork Orange.
 At about two hours and 30 minutes, the film begins to falter during the
last 20 minutes, a sequence that seems most Spielbergian with images
that appear to be borrowed from Close Encounters.
 It is all very anti-climatic and jarring. These scenes seem almost
superfluous, as if from a different film.
 A.I. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its PG-13 rating. It is a story
combining hope and intolerance, sacrifice and bigotry, and while it does
not coalesce perfectly, the movie does offer some disturbing images.
 But A.I. is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing
young Osment. If ever an actor deserved an Academy Award nomination, it
is this lad, who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of David,
a being created for the express purpose of loving.
 He beams when with Monica, beaming with love, as eager as a puppy to
please. After being left in the woods, he is confused, lost, hurt,
focusing on one objective: To become a real boy and find his way home so
he can redeem himself in his motherís eyes.
 Law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesnít understand
Davidís quest, but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey.
 Probably the toughest role is OíConnorís Monica. Playing an emotional
fragile woman who sees David as a substitute for her lost Martin, she
grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive David
not as a second chance, but as a threat to her family.
 She gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault
her for her course of action.
 Many of A.I.ís futuristic sets are breathtaking, especially a mostly
submerged New York, lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice
caps.
 A.I. is a flawed film, and you cannot get through the entire feature
without pondering ó even subconsciously ó how it would have turned out
with Kubrick instead of Spielberg behind the camera. Would it have been
darker? More cynical? We will never know.
 We can only judge what is before us on the screen, a collaboration of
two cinematic giants. A.I. is a most interesting and thought-provoking
examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us.

Directed by Steven Spielberg.
Cast: Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt, Sam 
Robards, Jake Thomas, Brendan Gleeson, April Grace.
2001 - 145 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for profanity and sexual situations).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, June 30, 2001.
Loosely based on the story, "Supertoys Last All Summer Long," by Brian 
Aldiss, and the late Stanley Kubrick's dream project up until his death in 
1999, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is as accomplished a motion picture as 
anything director Steven Spielberg has ever made. Following Kubrick's 
unfortunate passing, Spielberg, who had prior been collaborating ideas with 
him concerning "A.I.," decided to make it his next directorial effort, both 
as a movie that he was passionate and excited about, and as a loving tribute 
to one of the great masters of the cinema.
The end result of the long, arduous, 25-year journey of "A.I." is a 
science-fiction film filled with endless imagination and wonder; a mature, 
almost devastating fairy tale; and a thought-provoking rumination on the 
importance of love, and determined hope, in one's life. The movie is, indeed, 
a Spielberg production, although it does feature an icy, somehow bleak, 
emotional core that is certainly Kubrickian in spirit, and undoubtedly 
intentional. Using the approach of differing styles of moviemaking (with 
Spielberg more of a wide-eyed optimist) turns out to work extraordinarily 
well in this film's case, as the picture is deeply touching and effective 
without being maudlin, and occasionally sterile without coming off as 
cold-hearted. 
Set in a futuristic setting, following the melting of the ice caps which has 
drowned entire U.S. cities (including Manhattan), Professor Hobby (William 
Hurt) has created a string of mechas--robots with the physical appearance of 
humans--to live in the world. With all mechas having been made into adults up 
until this point, Hobby introduces his most life-like creation yet: an 
11-year-old boy named David (Haley Joel Osment). Programmed to be able to 
love (the first of his kind to be able to do such a thing), David is taken in 
by Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) and her husband, Henry (Sam Robards), as 
a child "substitute" for their own young son, Martin (Jake Thomas), who has 
been cryogenically frozen while they await a cure for the disease he has. 
At first creeped out by David, Henry and Monica quickly warm up to him, and 
in Monica's case, falls in love with what is now her new son. Aside from not 
being able to eat or sleep, David is exactly like a regular boy, delighting 
in mimicking and picking up new information, as well as being able to play 
games. When Martin suddenly awakes from his comatose state and begins to get 
better, he rejoins his parents' lives, and in the process, David 
progressively loses the attention and, through a series of circumstances out 
of his control, made to look potentially dangerous. Forced to get rid of him, 
but not wanting him destroyed by the company for returning him, Monica drives 
David into the forest one day, and leaves him there alone, with only a 
mechanical, talking teddy bear as company.
Leading up to its release, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" was purposefully 
advertised in an obscure manner that didn't give away much of its premise, or 
hardly any scenes from the film itself. This was the wisest choice anyone 
could have made, as "A.I." is a gloriously creative film that prospers from 
its sheer unpredictability, and constant reminder that it is not just another 
"dumb sci-fi movie," but a motion picture overflowing with exciting ideas and 
relevant themes. 
Believing that Monica will love him if only he becomes a real boy, David sets 
off to find the Blue Fairy from the fairy tale, "Pinocchio," whom he 
earnestly believes is the only one with the power to grant him his wish. On 
his journey, he meets a fellow mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), whose name 
reveals what he has been programmed to do. Joe is a cynic, but forms a bond 
with David, and consequently, helps him to accomplish his mission, even if it 
is a lost cause. It is never clear to the viewer if the Blue Fairy does 
genuinely exist, and this mystery is what fuels the entire second half of the 
film.
Haley Joel Osment (2000's "Pay It Forward") is a revelation as David, even 
more so than in 1999's box-office smash, "The Sixth Sense," which led him to 
an Oscar nomination. At only 13-years-old, Osment's ability to convey utter 
realism and subtlety in each of his performances is remarkable, to say the 
least. This has never been so apparent as right here, in a difficult and 
complex role as a sympathetic character who is, nonetheless, not real, but a 
machine. Osment must carry the whole movie solely on his shoulders, and he 
hits every note exactly right. Simply no other child actor could have done as 
refined and impressive of a job.
The cast that surrounds Osment is truly fine, as well. Jude Law (1999's "The 
Talented Mr. Ripley") is self-assured and appropriately cocky and cool as 
Gigolo Joe. Law  plausibly paints Joe as a person (read: robot) who is suave, 
undeniably sexy, and devoted to pleasing women. As the increasingly 
distraught, yet caring, Monica, Frances O'Connor (2000's "Bedazzled") is 
heartbreaking, particularly in the bravura sequence in which she takes David 
on a trip that she knows will only have one of them returning home. Finally, 
William Hurt (1998's "One True Thing") is emphatically low-key and memorable 
as David's inventor, Professor Hobby, who may have an ulterior motive behind 
his creation of a mecha child.
The technical credits of "A.I." are awe-inspiring. Spielberg regular Janusz 
Kaminski's cinematography is both beautiful and understated, as is John 
Williams' unusually poetic music score. And the production design and visual 
effects, by Industrial Light & Magic, are a sight to behold. There are images 
throughout that will stick with you long after the lights in the theater have 
gone up, especially the depiction of New York City engulfed in an endless 
sea, as well as the haunting underwater creation of Coney Island.
A tragic, if inspiring, motion picture event, there are impassioned issues 
about humanity that are brought up which will resonate with every viewer. And 
the imagination and artistry which the film has been made with is 
second-to-none. To watch "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is to experience a 
visually astounding and emotionally rewarding triumph that, in time, is sure 
to go down as one of the all-time brilliant achievements in modern 
moviemaking. Stanley Kubrick sure would have been proud.

  A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (director/writer: Steven Spielberg ;
screenwriters: Ian Watson (screen story)/Brian Aldiss--based on his short story
"Supertoys Last All Summer Long'' by Brian Aldiss; cinematographer: Janusz
Kaminski; editor: Michael 
Kahn; cast: Haley Joel Osment (David), Jude Law (Gigolo Joe), Frances O'Connor
(Monica Swinton), Sam Robards (Henry Swinton), Jake Thomas (Martin Swinton),
Brendan Gleeson (Lord Johnson-Johnson), William Hurt (Professor Hobby), Jack
Angel (Voice of Teddy), Robin Williams (Voice of Dr. Know), Ben Kingsley
(Narrator); Runtime: 145; Warner Bros./DreamWorks; 2001) 
Stanley Kubrick until his untimely death was working on a project that weighed
for a long time on his mind -- the subject of artificial intelligence. He worked
on a treatment 
he prepared with Ian Watson based on the 1969 Brian Aldiss short story and the
many drawings he'd done with Chris Baker, which were both handed over to Steven
Spielberg. He also hired an engineer to live on his English estate and build the
perfect child robot, waiting all these years for technology to advance before he
made his film. Steven Spielberg is given the blessing by the Kubrick estate to
take over that project, and he brings his great craftsmanship skill as a visual
story teller to the film while paying homage to Kubrick's intentions and themes
he wanted developed. He succeeds for most of the film in keeping it tight while
presenting an occasional riveting psychological moment or two, as he tells a
fairy tale for adults; it's a version which will go way over the heads of
children and many of the adults. What he does is put the Pinocchio fairy tale,
the Frankenstein story, and the Oedipus myth in his warm-hearted blender and
gives them a good mixing up. He also takes full credit for the script and does
not include Kubrick as co-screenwriter; he only credits him with the film's
idea. 
What Spielberg fails to do is tell the fairy tale ending in the same artistic
way a Kubrick would have displayed his mastery of telling a good mystery story.
He does turn the climax into one which should have critics wondering about his
intentions for a long-time to come, as in his use of the academic voiceover
lecture to end the film on. It was a thoughtful climactic touch but what the
film demanded for it to be considered as a masterpiece, is a more lyrical note
to end it on; which is the most glaring fault of the film. 
What Spielberg delivers is a film that leaves you thinking about what the end of
human civilization means and how close to artificial intelligence can the world
be as its reality, and about how love is something that can't be programmed
without something being amiss about it. It also does not have Spielberg's usual
dosage of sentimentality, which has played havoc with most of his previous
films. 
It's a splendid film that pays homage to both himself and Kubrick for their
noteworthy films. Spielberg for his Close Encounters of a Third Kind/E. T.. 
Kubrick for his 2001: A Space Odyssey/Eyes Wide Shut. 
It's a Hollywood film that defies what a Hollywood film is about, while in
essence still being a Hollywood film of excesses and special effects. This is
one of the best films Spielberg has ever made, and his most thought-provoking
one. It has much of both giant filmmakers locked into this story, though it's a
Spielberg film and not a Kubrick one. 
A.I. is set in the near-future, mid-21st century, as narrator Ben Kingsley
explains that the melted ice caps are a common sight. The sight of NYC submerged
under the ocean is both bleak and visually satisfying. Most of civilization is
submerged in destruction of their land mass, and it's common for families to
have robots to do their work out of necessity because of the labor shortage.
These robots are created to function as humanoids and are known as "mechas." 
The film opens when the optimistically brilliant NYC robot designer, Dr. Hobby
(William Hurt), in the middle of lecturing his colleagues about his latest
revolutionary creation -- "a  robot child with a love that will never end." The
robot can dream, has an unconscious state and can feel both pain and love. Hobby
fields all question and with the self-satisfied air of a true believer in the
prevailing biblical myth, mentions to his doubters: "Didn't God create Adam so
that he might love Him?" What is hinted at, is that we are just beginning to see
what the possibilities there are in A.I.. Until now all the robots have to be
programmed by us but, perhaps, in 50 years these robots will be able to not only
program themselves and surpass their creators, but give us eternal life if we
can feed into their system and give up our human life (after all the mind is
what makes us human and not our body parts). But in order for the robots to have
a live intelligence and not merely a programmed one, they will have to be
created like nature creates its plants and animals. It is this possibility that
will always leave them flawed, but with the potential to push evolution to new
levels. In that time, possibly by the middle of this century, the robots will
become real creatures. 
Hobby's creation is the angelic blond named David (Haley Joel Osment), and he's
awarded twenty months later for adoption to a couple, Henry (Sam Robards) and
Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), whose six year old, Martin (Jake Thomas), has
been frozen the last five years with a critical illness. David, the cybertronic
simulation of a boy, is Henry's surprise gift to his wife, hoping that the
child's programmed unswerving love for her will make her forget her real son's
debilitation. 
David's initial programmed response to Monica is: "Mommy, will you die?" 
For the first hour or so, the story takes place in the couple's suburban upscale
home and the action is limited to how they adjust to each other. When Martin
suddenly recovers and returns home, a jealous Cain and Abel sibling rivalry for
their mother's attention ensues. Into the mix is thrown a robotic Teddy bear,
Martin's supertoy, who can walk and talk, and he now becomes a constant
companion of David's. In the meantime Martin replaces his Teddy by making David
his new supertoy. What results is that the family has many misgivings about
David and what his love means to them. After a few questionable incidents they
decide to dump the robot. In one incident David sneaks into mom's bedroom while
she's asleep to clip a lock of her hair because of Martin goading him to do it.
When mom awakens to see the scissors in his hand, she instinctively feels more
love for her flawed real son than her programmed loving one. There's also an
alarming swimming pool incident where David almost drowns the sneaky Martin, and
there's a spinach eating incident that Martin goads David into (robots can't eat
and if they do it messes up their inside circuitry). They decide to return David
to the cybertronic lab in New Jersey, in the same way a disheartened pet owner
might do when taking their unwanted pet to an animal shelter. In this case it
means destruction and a trip to the scrap heap (which is like a junkyard for
autos). But mom can't bear to have her artificial son destroyed, so she sends it
out into the woods with Teddy Bear as a companion and tells the boy to learn how
to survive and not to trust humans -- but to never come home again. David is
touched by human feelings and only wishes he could be created again as a real
boy (the film's main theme), and once again be with Monica. Having absorbed the
Pinocchio story read to him by Monica at bedtime (even though he has no need to
sleep), he believes if he can find the "Blue Fairy" he can get his only wish in
life and be once again reunited with Monica as a real boy through her making him
real, just like she made the wooden Pinocchio real. 
The second half of the story becomes layered with more complex themes and harder
to answer questions. It's a spiritual odyssey about creation that David takes in
the hardened nocturnal world of what remains of urban civilization, which is a
reflection of a literary hell. It's here that Spielberg asks questions about
humanity that he has never asked before in his more lightweight films: he
questions family values and wonders about scientific and religious definitions
of creation, and he most of all wonders if humanity is only one link in
evolution that raises consciousness and that if it becomes obsolete what will be
the other ways to evolve. 
In these scenes to find the Blue Fairy, David and Teddy team up with an agile
mecha gigolo named Joe (Law). But they must escape from "antirobot human bounty
hunters on motor bikes'' and their mean leader (Gleeson), who captures these
stray mechas for Roman gladiator-like entertainment events and takes them to a
place called Flesh Fair. Here the amusement park operators find gruesome novel
ways to kill the mechas off to entertain their thrill-seeking audience. The trio
escapes to a neon-lit Rouge City, a seedy place where the animated stud, Joe,
had previously pleasured his women clientele and claims to know all that there's
to know about women. It's here that the trio encounter a wizard answer man
called Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams). He sends them on their way to the
"End of the World" to meet the Blue Fairy, in the submerged New York. It takes
David a mere 2000 years to reach his destination, but once there he has the
entrancing showdown with what life means and finds out that the best you can do
is return to the dream world. 
It's an imaginative film, that has a lot going for it except exciting dialogue.
I couldn't ask for anything more from Spielberg; he has taken on Kubrick's depth
and artistic integrity in filmmaking, at least, for this film; he has paid
homage to Kubrick, and has made a highly personal film. This might disappoint
many in the mass market audience that are attracted to Spielberg for other
reasons and might expect to see another kiddie pic like E. T.. But the film will
also attract a more sophisticated sci-fi film crowd, that should connect this
film with a "2001" cyberspace experience. 
The acting accolades go to Haley Joel Osment -- who carries the film as an
innocent, albeit, unreal child, left alone and vulnerable in a very cruel world;
he only wants to return to the only home he has ever known; and, to Jude Law,
who is refreshingly daffy as a gigolo and friend to David.

A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Haley Joel
Osment, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, William Hurt, Sam Robards and Frances
O'Connor. Music by John Williams. Based on a short story by Brian Aldiss. Based
on a screenplay by Ian Watson. Screenplay by Steven Spielberg. Directed by
Spielberg. Rated PG-13 
It is easy to see why the late Stanley Kubrick believed Steven Spielberg would
be the perfect director for his A.I. Artificial Intelligence, just as it is
understandable why Spielberg was attracted to the material. 
For here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home, an outcast
seeking family, themes very familiar from most of Spielberg's body of work from
Sugarland Express to Close Encounters of the Third Kind to E.T. to Empire of the
Sun to Hook to Saving Private Ryan, naming just a few examples. 
A.I. is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances
have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to
fulfilling sexual fantasies. It is an era when robots are treated merely as
sophisticated appliances. 
The last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions, and with
the number of births limited by the government, many couples are yearning for
children. 
And Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has the solution. A robotic boy named David
(Haley Joel Osment), who is programmed to love. As a test, David is placed with
Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife, Monica (Frances O'Connor). Their
natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his
illness. 
The first third of A.I. deals with David's life with the Swintons and how that
is changed by the recovery and return of their son, Martin. 
Circumstances force David to be cut off from the Swintons. He is abandoned and
alone. David, highly influenced by the fairy tale, Pinocchio, feels that if he
becomes a real boy he can rekindle Monica's love for him. 
The film's second act follows David's search for The Blue Fairy, whom he
believes will be able to fulfill his wish. During these adventures he meets and
is helped by Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot who specializes in sex. 
Spielberg is at his top form in this sequence, offering a brutal "Flesh Fair"
where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying
customers. 
Here, is where Kubrick's influence is strongly felt, as the movie explores the
fear and distrust humans have for robots. The savagery conjures up images from
the late director's A Clockwork Orange. 
At about two hours and 30 minutes, the film begins to falter during the last 20
minutes, a sequence that seems most Spielbergian with images that appear to be
borrowed from Close Encounters. 
It is all very anti-climatic and jarring. These scenes seem almost superfluous,
as if from a different film. 
A.I. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its PG-13 rating. It is a story
combining hope and intolerance, sacrifice and bigotry, and while it does not
coalesce perfectly, the movie does offer some disturbing images. 
But  A.I. is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young
Osment. If ever an actor deserved an Academy Award nomination, it is this lad,
who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of David, a being created for
the express purpose of loving. 
He shines when with Monica, beaming with love, as eager as a puppy to please.
After being left in the woods, he is confused, lost, hurt, focusing on one
objective: To become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself
in his mother's eyes. 
Law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand David's
quest, but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey. 
Probably the toughest role is O'Connor's Monica. Playing an emotional fragile
woman who sees David as a substitute for her lost Martin, she grows conflicted
after her boy returns and she begins to perceive David not as a second chance,
but as a threat to her family. 
She gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her
course of action. 
Many of A.I.'s futuristic sets are breathtaking, especially a mostly submerged
New York, lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps. 
A.I. is a flawed film, and you cannot get through the entire feature without
pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with Kubrick
instead of Spielberg behind the camera. Would it have been darker? More cynical?
We will never know. 
We can only judge what is before us on the screen, a collaboration of two
cinematic giants. A.I. is a most interesting and thought-provoking examination
of a future that is quickly gaining on us.

The tone of Steven Spielberg's AI is uneven because of his collaboration 
with the late director Stanley Kubrick  but a mediocre work from either of 
these masters is still superior to fare offered by most other filmmakers.
Apparently Mr. Kubrick had been developing the project for years, and 
requested Mr. Spielberg to take it over.  Based on a short story by Brian 
Aldiss, as well as the screen story by Ian Watson, AI is the first 
screenplay written by Speilberg since his CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD 
KIND.  The piece opens with a speech by Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) to his 
colleagues, a proclamation that even more human-like robots should be 
developed and marketed by his company.  Switch to the home of one of the 
company's employees, Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife Monica 
(Frances O'Connor), whose son Martin is in cryogenic suspension because of a 
disease beyond current science.  Dr. Hobby and the company place a prototype 
of a robot designed to mimic a human child  David, played by Haley Joel 
Osment, with the Swintons.  For several sequences we are treated to mildly 
creepy scenes, but the real rub begins when Monica commences the ritualistic 
activation of David's special programming  he is designed to love the one 
on whom he imprints, and even more intensely, to seek love from him or her.
What engaging questions Spielberg is raising here.  First (and I heard this 
idea recently on a radio interview unrelated to the movie), why should 
humans strive to create machines in their own images?  Why not make them 
functional in the ways an auto manufacturer engineers a welding robot, 
without legs or a minutely mimetic face?  Just because we might at some time 
have the technology to make a completely plausible copy of a human, does 
that mean we should?  Most importantly  and this idea hearkens back to many 
other films, such as WESTWORLD or the less well-known ZPG (ZERO POPULATION 
GROWTH)  should we interact with these super toys just as we interact with 
other humans  as objects and sources of passion and love?  Can a `mecha' 
(the mechanistic versus the organic, or `orga,' by the way) assume the full 
role of homo sapien?
The grist of the film is the social hierarchy you would expect from Stanley 
Kubrick.  The `mechas' are the quite literally disposable underclass, the 
target of the hatred of the `orgas,' and a marginalized and easily 
persecuted subculture.  In some of the most gripping scenes, the robots are 
rounded up and finally held in a cage.  Reminding us of ancient Christians 
awaiting slaughter by lions, the various generations of personified machines 
are destroyed by different perverse methods, the center of a spectacle known 
as the `Flesh Fair.'  After some very powerful scenes in the upset lives of 
the Swinton family, David is discarded, and falls in with another mecha on 
the run, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a love-slave robot framed for murder.  In 
this central section of the film, David and Joe become both fugitives and 
adventurers, as David pursues his quest of finding the Blue Fairy, the 
character with whom he has become obsessed since hearing that she turned 
Pinocchio into a real boy; David reasons, of course, that after he becomes 
human, his mother would love him more than ever, and accept him back into 
her life.
Haley Joel Osment pulls off his robot act extremely well.  His David is 
supposed to be seamless in his movements  and that's probably not hard to 
act out.  But Osment excels with the emotional infancy that David must 
suffer through.  He's a boy of eleven or so and suddenly must bond closely 
with his `Mommy,' a woman whom he called Monica just seconds before his 
activation.   What a young age to be capable of such consistently strong 
performances!
Spielberg certainly deserves credit for surrounding his main player with 
such capable supporting actors.  The parents, Robards and O'Connor, turn in 
fine performances, and Jude Law is strangely accurate in his portrayal of 
this empathetic yet egotistical automaton.   There's a certain likable 
cheesiness about his personality, especially when he cocks his head and 
early twentieth-century romantic tunes come from his body.  A great make-up 
job too.
The special effects are wonderful, as one would expect from a science 
fiction film with Steven Spielberg at the helm.  Animatronic effects are 
done by the master himself, Stan Winston.  I especially like the little bear 
named Teddy, voiced by the veteran of many animated outings, Jack Angel.  He 
is at once gruff and cute.
I have heard that AI differs from anything Spielberg has done so far.  I 
would agree, though many scenes inevitably evoke memories of portions of his 
work.  There's the confusion of Shanghai streets in EMPIRE OF THE SUN; there 
are the intimate familial relationships (and the moon) from ET; there are 
several images straight from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  It is when the story returns 
to David's quest for the Fairy  and for the all-important mother love  
that the momentum slows.  It is fair to say that the third and final act is 
effective enough, though it does not seem to realize its parentage.  What 
comes before it is not exactly adequate foreshadowing for a brutally 
realistic Kubrickian climax; nor is it the comfy Spielbergian rising action. 
  Nevertheless, the film takes big risks, and even though they are not all 
successful, we come away with amazement and thoughts to keep us busy for 
several hours and conversations.

"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Written and Directed by Steven Spielberg (based on a short story by Brian 
Aldiss)
Starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and Frances O'Connor
Official Site: http://aimovie.warnerbros.com/
Grade:  B-
In "An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn," a director demands final cut 
on his picture.  A studio head responds, "Nobody gets final cut except 
Spielberg and Kubrick!"  This is possibly the only time the names of these 
famous directors were mentioned in the same sentence before "A.I." linked 
them to the same project.  Stanley Kubrick worked for years on developing 
Brian Aldiss' "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" into a film.  Before his 
death, Kubrick passed the project on to Steven Spielberg.  Little probably 
remains of Kubrick in "A.I." except for the use of some of his production 
designs for Rouge City, where architecture is derived from the erotic female 
form, and in cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's use of natural light.  (Some 
of Kubrick's designs can be seen in the recent documentary "Stanley Kubrick: 
A Life in Pictures.")
The plot explores familiar science-fiction themes, particularly whether 
artificial intelligence (A.I.) constitutes human life.  The A.I. in question 
belongs to David (Haley Joel Osment), a prototype of a new kind of "mecha" 
(android) that is capable of love.  Up til now, mechas have only been able to 
simulate emotions, but Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) has created a 
child-surrogate who will genuinely love its owner/parent.  Enter Monica and 
Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards), whose son Martin (Jake 
Thomas) is in a coma.  Henry brings David home, and, after some initial 
reluctance, Monica initiates David's attachment programming.  However, Martin 
miraculously recovers and returns home.  Naturally, he resents his new 
brother and begins to needle David; David is unable to compete because he's 
programmed to be an ideal child and aspects like sibling rivalry and childish 
cruelty are not part of the package.
After an accident nearly drowns Martin, Monica decides to get rid of David.  
Once a mecha has attached itself to a parent, it cannot be reprogrammed and 
must be destroyed.  However, Monica cannot bring herself to take David back 
to his manufacturer to be melted down, so she releases him in the forest.  
Taking his cue from Pinocchio, David decides to seek out the Blue Fairy to 
turn him into a real boy so his mother will love him again.  As companions he 
has a mecha Teddy Bear (voice of Jack Angel) and a "love-mecha" named Gigolo 
Joe (Jude Law).  
The premise seems sick and sad.  Why would anyone create a child that never 
grows up?  Why would anyone want to love a child whose destiny is to be 
destroyed when its parent dies or becomes bored?  Kubrick specialized in 
"sick and sad," and he may have intended to explore these areas.  However, 
Spielberg seems too wrapped in the high-tech Pinocchio story to think about 
how twisted David's very existence is.
Something about science fiction brings out the sappiest side of Spielberg.  
His aliens in "Close Encounters" and "ET" are the warmest and fuzziest this 
side of Ewoks.  (But even Ewoks tried to eat the humans.)  The treacle of a 
robot's quest to be a real boy is only interesting because the goal seems 
impossible.  However, Spielberg seems unable to accept that.  There is a 
point where the movie seems to end, after David finds the Blue Fairy.  It's a 
good ending, a powerful ending, but a downer.  Spielberg seems unwilling to 
accept that, so the movie continues the story in the even more distant 
future.  
At the heart of the problem in "A.I." is probably Spielberg's father issues.  
He has a well-documented tendency to depict fathers as absent, reluctant, or 
distant.  This theme explains the otherwise bewildering fact that David is 
only programmed to bond with one parent.  David's "father" Henry seems 
irrelevant to David and to Spielberg, who uses Henry as a catalyst to 
introduce David to Monica, then pushes Henry aside.  As David's quest 
develops, he doesn't want to win a place in the family; instead, he wants to 
eliminate his father and brother and have his mother all to himself.  
Spielberg's greatest asset and greatest weakness as a filmmaker is that he 
is, at heart, a ten-year-old boy who never grew up.  This aspect of his 
personality gives his films a trademark sense of wonder that can be 
compelling.  But judging by the self-indulgent ending tacked onto this 
picture, the ten-year-old is still working on his Oedipal conflict.

The summer of 2001 has been pretty disappointing so far, at least
cinematically (although that story about the monster who drowned her kids
should satisfy our tabloid cravings for several months).  Sure, the box
office numbers are at an all-time high, but each blockbuster has been as
empty as the Bush administration's commitment to the environment.  How
strange it is that the season's best (and most cerebral) film is about a
world in which Bush and his cronies have melted the polar icecaps and buried
most coastal cities under hundreds of feet of water.  And that this world
restricts its citizens when it comes to pregnancy because there just isn't
enough food to feed everybody.  And that the leading scientific minds are
able to create robotic "child substitutes" who can actually be programmed to
love parents that are unable to have kids of their own.  It makes you wonder
how many years you get for drowning five robo-kids.
The film, of course, is A.I. (for Artificial Intelligence), the long-awaited
collaboration between Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan) and the late
Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut), who have a combined 22 Oscar nominations
(but just three trophies) between them.  Kubrick bought the rights to Brian
Aldiss' 1969 short story Supertoys Last All Summer, the inspiration for
A.I., about 20 years ago but lacked both the technology and the pace to
direct the film himself (think about it - the young actor playing Kubrick's
robo-boy would be 28 when he finally finished filming)  He tapped Spielberg
to direct, gave him thousands of storyboards, and had planned to stay on as
a producer before his untimely demise.
So what is a collaboration between Kubrick and Spielberg like?  Well, it's
very dark and probably isn't suitable for young kids (the Kubrick part), but
still manages to be cute and button-pushing (the Spielberg part)  A.I.'s
first section (there are three) is defiantly the most Kubrickian.  It
focuses on a young couple (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor and Bounce's Sam
Robards) whose young son, Martin (Jake Thomas, The Cell), is dying from a
fatal illness. Henry, the father, is an employee of Cybertronics, one of the
world's leading robot manufacturers.  The company makes their money with
lifelike sexbots, robo-butlers and the like, but their leader (William Hurt,
Sunshine) wants to try something new - making a robotic child capable of
loving its parents. After all, "Didn't God create Adam to love Him?"
The first model, named David (Haley Joel Osment, Pay It Forward), is given
to Henry, who brings it home to his horrified wife, still grieving over the
potential loss of her only son.  She eventually grows to love David, but
when Martin miraculously recovers, the faux son falls out of favor with his
parents.  The film's two biggest themes - jealousy and aspiration - come
into play when David hears the story of Pinocchio and longs to become a real
boy so that his mommy will love him as much as Martin.  His desire to become
flesh begins to cloud his mind, leading him to believe he is real and
nothing like the robot supertoy Teddy, a walking, talking bear that serves
as David's sidekick (and sounds a whole lot like Douglas Rain's HAL 9000).
Without giving too much of the story away (they did well to keep much of it
under wraps), David and Teddy go on an incredible journey in which they
encounter people who hate robots (led by The Tailor of Panama's Brendan
Gleeson), a gigolo (Jude Law, Enemy at the Gates), and a Ministry concert
(!?) in their search for The Blue Fairy that David believes will make him a
real boy.  Parts of the film get Phantom-Menaced down a bit, especially in
one scene that features the voice of Robin Williams, but for the most part,
it's all good.
Best of all is the chirpy Osment, who not only proves the whole Sixth Sense
thing wasn't a fluke, but logs in the year's best acting performance to
date. A.I. also features a handful of surprising cameo voices, like Chris
Rock, Meryl Streep and Ben Kingsley, who narrates the opening and closing
scenes. Spielberg, who has won Oscars for direction each of the last two
times he's tackled dramas (Ryan, Schindler's List), penned the script
himself (his first since Close Encounters of the Third Kind).  His band of
merry men do a great job with the technical stuff, highlighted by creepy
production design courtesy of Rick Carter (What Lies Beneath) and
Ryan/Schindler's Oscar winners Janusz Kaminski (cinematography) and Michael
Kahn (editing).  And the John Williams score, which lately have been
nauseatingly repetitious, is warm, effective and bolstered by the Los
Angeles Master Chorale.
2:21 - PG-13 for some sexual content and violent images

Like a kid waiting for Christmas morning, I've been counting the days
until the release of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." While the prospect
of a beyond-the-grave collaboration between filmmakers Stanley Kubrick
and Steven Spielberg was exciting, what really juiced me up was the
concept, because the era of sentient machines is coming.
Our brightest minds will construct mechanical beings that independently
think and feel. Their first efforts will be crude, and we will need to
treat the androids with the sort of extra patience we reserve for our
mentally limited loved ones. Over the years, these creations will grow
ever more sophisticated, eventually improving on their own design
without the aid of man.
There will be controversy, of course. Some will claim that such efforts
are an affront to God, while others will insist that we are simply
carrying out the next step in a divine plan. How we behave towards these
children of mankind will measure our own humanity. Will we dismiss them
as mere appliances or treat them with condescension, regarding them as
slave labor made to serve our needs? Hopefully, we will come to
recognize them as an equal life form, leading to an age where organic
and mechanical beings work together (Cue the orchestra as I continue my
Captain Picard rant).
I picture a faraway time when a human can opt for earthly immortality by
moving his or her consciousness to a designer body, co-existing with the
"pure" androids. Heck, there may even come a day when mentally superior
androids must remind themselves not to be patronizing to the less adept
cybernetic humans. Kind of makes you dizzy, eh?
"A.I." is an incredibly ambitious film that addresses these notions
along with many others. Loosely based on the short story "Supertoys Last
All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss, the production was Stanley Kubrick's
dream project for years. After collaborating with Steven Spielberg on
the particulars, Kubrick finally passed the film to Spielberg, believing
it was better suited to his sensibilities. Fractured, but dazzling, the
result is a dark, often cruel tale of obsession and intolerance. Ads for
the movie trumpet it as a fairy tale, but moms and dads should be aware
that this is a grim story that could trigger nightmares. Despite its
PG-13 rating, the film is appropriate only for very mature, reflective
children and then only if their folks also see the movie and set aside
time to discuss the images and issues. Anything less is irresponsible
parenting.
The futuristic drama is broken into three acts (SPOILER ALERT: The
following reveals basic plot elements). The first, set a few decades
from now, begins with the announcement from a professor (William Hurt)
of his intention to upgrade the current crop of robots by creating a
mechanical boy with a subconscious, capable of dreaming and experiencing
emotions. Twenty months later, David (Haley Joel Osment) moves in with
Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor), a couple
grieving the absence of their son, who was forced into cryogenic stasis
by illness. The exacting 50-minute segment is mesmerizing and maddening,
as a potentially workable situation grows intolerable due to a series of
misunderstandings that could have been corrected had the involved
parties simply talked things through.
But they don't, which leads to the second act, a fantastic journey
teaming David and his supertoy Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel) with Gigolo
Joe (Jude Law), a sex-robot on the run after being framed for murder by
a jealous husband. Together, they experience Flesh Fair, a "Thunderdome"
style extravaganza where runaway "mechas" (mechanical creations) are
tortured and destroyed for the amusement of twisted humans. Some of the
more visually horrific moments take place here.
Fueled by David's quest to find the Blue Fairy that can make him a "real
boy," just like Mommy read aloud in "Pinocchio" (how very sensitive of
her), they move on to Rouge City, a flashy, trashy neon enclave for
mechas. After a visit to "Dr. Know," a business where a cartoon hologram
(annoyingly voiced by Robin Williams) answers questions for a fee, the
trio moves on to Manhattan, flooded by melting polar ice caps to the
point where only the tops of buildings remain above water. Here David
has a fateful encounter that leads to the final act, set 2,000 years in
the future, with the distant descendants of the mechas (incorrectly
labeled as aliens in many reviews) providing the means for the story's
bizarre conclusion (END SPOILERS).
The tagline for "A.I.," "His love is real, but he is not" reflects a
fundamental problem with the movie. David can reason, care and suffer.
He is quite real. Sadly, his "love" is actually a programmed obsession
that blocks the boy from growing emotionally, but I'm not sure whether
or not Spielberg understands that. The relationship between David and
his "mommy" is about co-dependency, not love and the final scene of the
film, which I believe Spielberg considers satisfying, is but the last
painful image in an epic tragedy.
Flawed though it may be, "A.I." stands head and shoulders above most
films. I could go on for pages, but unfortunately, space is limited, so
I'll leave you with this: "A.I." is packed with freaky, haunting,
generally amazing images, accented by one of John Williams' better
scores. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are terrific, and the bleak story
offers a cornucopia of intriguing concepts. Adventurous filmgoers should
not miss this movie.

A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (2001) / *** 1/2
Directed by Steven Spielberg. Screenplay by Spielberg, from a story by Ian
Watson, based on the short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian
Aldiss. Starring Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, Jude Law. Running
time: 146 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 22nd, 2001.
Synopsis: David (Osment), a child-like robot programmed to express love, 
is given to a family whose son was placed in suspended animation because 
he suffers from an incurable disease. But when the son unexpectedly 
returns, David is no longer needed. His "mother" (O'Connor) abandons him 
rather than let him be destroyed. Finding friendship with another robot, 
Gigolo Joe (Law), David sets off on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, who he 
believes will help him regain his mother's love.
Review: How do we define a person? Where does "artificial" end and 
"intelligence" begin? Is there a difference between someone who loves us, 
and something programmed to do so? These are the questions raised by 
"A.I.", a film directed by Spielberg but so reminiscent of its originator, 
Kubrick, that his ghost haunts almost every frame. "A.I." wraps these 
conundrums in a quest, but at the end of the quest lie more questions. The 
answers are left to the viewers, who are pulled en route in every 
direction. Is David's longing for his mother proof of his humanity? 
Perhaps, but still, David is undeniably not human, as we are periodically 
reminded. Whatever one concludes, "A.I." is certainly one of the most 
thought-provoking films in recent memory. It is abetted by spectacular 
performances, with Osment proving he is perhaps the best child actor 
working today. David is endearing, but a persistent awkward edge reminds 
us of his artificiality. And Spielberg's visuals are stunning, perfectly 
complementing "A.I."'s central contradiction. His humans live in a stark 
world of clinical coldness; the robots inhabit a chaotic, colourful 
universe. The humans are passive and remote; the robots cling desperately 
to life. And although "A.I." does suffer from an extended coda that never 
quite works, it remains a fine tribute to the genius that was Kubrick.

A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) 145m 
In much the same way that Spielberg included the adjunct 'EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL' 
to his film E.T., the self-explanatory 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE' has been 
tagged on to what was previously known simply as A.I.  One can't imagine the 
late Stanley Kubrick, who nursed the project for many years, making such 
concessions, suggestive as they are of a dumbing-down of the original 
concept, but for all intents Spielberg has brought his version of it to the 
screen with integrity.  While he and Kubrick are considered superb 
technicians and masters of film-making, their art is approached from 
viewpoints that couldn't seem more opposite.  Spielberg is an emotive 
choreographer; Kubrick a philosophical visionary.  Kubrick spent years 
developing his story for A.I. (so many that he died before getting a final 
script); Spielberg had finished principal photography barely a year after 
announcing his intentions to make the film.  Whether or not A.I. is a 
success or failure is almost secondary to the fact that it creates an 
irresistible intersection point between these two major talents. 
The 'Spielbrick' film, then, sees its genesis in a very short Brian Aldiss 
story, 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'.  In truth this story by itself 
makes more sense as a Spielberg project than it does a Kubrick one, a fact 
that Kubrick himself acknowledged when he handed the material over to 
Spielberg for completion.  Significantly, it became the first feature 
screenplay written by Spielberg for nearly twenty years.  A.I. concerns 
itself with cybernetic technology so advanced that it can formulate concepts 
about itself beyond the boundaries of its program.  Hence David, the 'boy' 
who is the central character of the film, believes he is capable of love and 
seeks it in return.  He simulates all emotional sensations to the extent 
that they resonate in his programming just the way they might influence 
themselves physically in a living human body.  What's intriguing about A.I. 
is that the subject matter itself almost requires the collaboration of these 
two very different film-makers - one could not have made it without the 
other.  David is both Spielberg and Kubrick, a work of technological 
craftsmanship searching for a soul, an answer, and a resolution. 
And here's the problem: A.I is multilayered, beautiful, unique and haunting, 
but early on it sets itself up for a resolution that it cannot possibly 
deliver.  David, drawing inspiration from the story of Pinocchio, wants to 
be a real boy.  This film may have fantastic elements, but it is not a 
fantasy, and no blue fairy is going to be waving a wand at its conclusion, 
which leaves only two outs: either David's mission will fail utterly or it 
will arrive at a compromise (which is another way of saying 'cop-out').  It 
appears that any likely ending is going to leave us wanting, but for a 
while, it looks like Spielberg has a chance of pulling it off.  On my first 
viewing of A.I. I had no idea of the film's length and thought that the film 
had reached its conclusion around the two hour mark, in a striking scene 
that found David confronting the object of his quest personified.  It was a 
moment I found profoundly moving, and the fact that it had drawn such a 
powerful emotional response from me was enough to prove itself entirely 
satisfying as the film's ending.  But as anyone who has seen the film knows, 
there is more to come beyond this scene, and A.I. still has a whole separate 
act to follow. 
As it happens, I find the 'actual' finale less satisfying if only for the 
reason that I'm not sure how I am  supposed to react to it emotionally.  
These narrative leaps of faith are more Kubrick's technique for storytelling 
than Spielberg's, and the film makes a habit of dramatically altering its 
tone and setting.  The first act is mesmerizing and intimate, and holds us 
in thrall with its world of possibilities; the second becomes visceral and 
nightmarish; the third a voyage of isolation, despair and hope.  It's an 
approach that will irritate many viewers, and at odds with the mass audience 
that Spielberg is accustomed to catering for.  If you're drawn into the 
story, then you won't care too much about its changing backgrounds.  The 
point is that the foreground remains the same throughout.  Haley Joel Osment 
is a wonder as David, pulling off the formidable task of making us believe 
he is an artificial life form, or 'mecha', from the moment he first appears. 
  His companionship with a pleasure mecha called Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a 
'supertoy' teddy bear provides cinema with a trio like none other you have 
seen (some of these images seem destined as instant classics).  The rest of 
A.I. follows suit - its distinctive art direction, continuously provocative 
questions (it doesn't try to presume answers), and John Williams score 
(which follows in the footsteps of Phillip Glass) combine to create a film 
like nothing that Spielberg, or anyone else for that matter, has done 
before. 
But technical aspects aside, the major achievement of A.I. must be that it 
is able to funnel our emotional investment into a character that is a 
machine, and moreover, to do it without seeming manipulative.  We are never 
allowed to forget that David is not a real boy, but this does not stop him 
from gaining our empathy.  Even though we should know better, we don't 
discriminate between a human being with real feelings, or a simulacra that 
is programmed to believe it has real feelings (in much the same way that a 
crowd at a robotic demolition derby are instantly convinced that David is 
real when he shows fear).  Why do we accept David so easily?  Because years 
of going to the movies have taught us so; for what is any person we see on 
screen but a scripted character played by a hired actor?  Arguably, the 
success of any film is not dependent on our abilities to separate ourselves 
from its actors or acting, but our connection with the emotional content 
they are working in.  Kubrick had already proved this with non-human 
characters in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, during the justifiably famous scene in 
which the computer HAL is dismantled and 'dies' before our eyes.  A.I. 
relies on that part of us, as human beings, which projects itself on to 
inanimate objects, and in turn is projected back to us via the cinema 
screen.  Is it possible to identify the moment where our animatism turns to 
animism?  It's one many conundrums offered in the story, and even David 
himself is unable to tell, as is heartbreakingly proved by his belief that a 
simple statue has the power to grant him a wish.  He may be the most 
sophisticated creation of his time, yet he is still programmed with the 
reasoning of a child. 
In the end, A.I. is the kind of project that the term 'flawed masterpiece' 
is reserved for.  It reminds me of 'Tintin and Alph-Art', the final book of 
Herge's Tintin series that was unofficially completed in different 
capacities by other artists working from his notes and sketches.  It's 
there, and it's not there.  It almost feels like something that was never 
meant to be there, or something that you'd dreamed about but never expected 
to see in the waking world.  Even though Spielberg's heart is beating 
throughout A.I.  you still feel the ghost of Kubrick watching from hidden 
vantage points.  It may be disappointing, or it may be the stuff of genius.  
But the reasons I'd give for anyone interested in watching A.I. are the same 
I'd give for reading 'Alph-Art'.  The fact is, it was made, and we have the 
opportunity to see it at last, for better or worse: whether you think you're 
going to enjoy it or not, how could you bear never to know?

    CAPSULE: A very short story is expanded into a longish but 
    powerful film about time, durability, and purpose of existence 
    by the combined efforts of the late Stanley Kubrick and of 
    Steven Spielberg.  There are some very nice sequences in this 
    film, but overall it is stylistically uneven.  The story of 
    the robot that wanted to be human is getting a little 
    hackneyed for this film to really work throughout.  Though 
    some of the views of the future are very powerful.  Rating: 9 
    (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4)
Permanence is a major theme of A.I.  I am told a glass bottle takes a 
million years to biodegrade.  The purpose of that existence may end 
after a month--essentially its first moments of life, but the bottle 
goes on.  Its whole reason for existence is just the barest beginning 
of its journey.  This is bad for the environment, but not really for 
the bottle because it has no feelings.  But what if a machine could be 
given feelings and told to love one person?  What happens to a machine 
that has emotions, but also longevity far greater than that of its 
reason for existence?  And can a machine really have feelings?  If not, 
why not since an accumulation of biological cells, what a human is, can 
have feelings?  These questions are the heart of A.I.
A.I. was a project developed by Stanley Kubrick going back to the 
early 1990s.  It used as a springboard the 1969 short story "Super-toys 
Last All Summer Long," by Brian W. Aldiss.  (A copy of the story can 
currently be found at http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0068.html.) 
I am not sure I understand why Kubrick saw so much potential in this 
particular story.  It seems to me to be a variation on an episode on "The 
Lateness of the Hour," an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  (The story in 
the film seems to lean more toward a different episode, "I Sing the Body 
Electric.") However, Arthur C. Clarke's "The Sentinel" would also seem an 
unpromising source and it made one of the classics of cinema 2001: A SPACE 
ODYSSEY.
Much as he had previously done with Clarke for 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, 
Kubrick wanted to partner with Brian Aldiss on the project of adapting 
his story.  Together they looked at a lot of variations on the 
narrative, none of which where suitable to Kubrick.  Kubrick then 
called in Clarke as his partner, but they could not agree where the 
story should go.  Kubrick tried science fiction author Bob Shaw, but 
Kubrick did not have a film until he brought in Ian Watson.  Allegedly 
when Kubrick thought the time was right he arranged a two-film deal, 
one film on the subject of sex, one returning to the science fiction 
field where he had enjoyed working in the past.  Those films were, of 
course, EYES WIDE SHUT and A.I.  Unfortunately, Kubrick lived only long 
enough to complete the former and to get the project moving on the 
latter.  Enter Steven Spielberg to inherit the A.I. project and bring 
it to completion.  Now, of course, it is unclear what is Kubrick's 
contribution and what is Spielberg's, but the resulting film is very 
different from either director's previous work.
Whatever the truth is on who contributed what, the film is wildly 
uneven in style like a landscape painted by a committee.  That is not 
necessarily a bad thing, it just makes the future world seem a bit 
schizophrenic.  It uses a variation on the Aldiss story as a core, but 
abruptly goes off in other directions.  There is even some feeling that 
the story was being held back by spending too much time on the Aldiss 
themes.
One might speculate that Kubrick filmed the first and last sections of 
the film and Spielberg did only the middle section.  Certainly acting 
styles seem that way.  In the first part of the film people appear 
pensive and insular in their own shells.  Not unlike the characters in 
2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY, people just do not seem to be connecting with 
each other.  The middle section of the film is set in a frenetic world 
like from TOTAL RECALL OF BLADERUNNER BEYOND THUNDERDOME.  The viewer 
should be warned that this is a film of about two and a half hours.  
Parts of the film, particularly toward the end when the pace slows, 
seem drawn out as it is.  If the viewer is expecting the film to wrap 
up, the final reel may seem interminable.
The story follows David (played by Haley Joel Osment), the first and 
only robot who has been given a capacity to love.  David is built for a 
couple, Monica and Henry Swinton (Francis O'Connor and Sam Robards), 
whose own son Martin is in a frozen state.  At first Monica wants no 
part of an artificial surrogate son, but that resolve starts to 
crumble.  The story takes off from there.  This is a lot like the plot 
of BICENTENNIAL MAN or Ray Bradbury's "I Sing the Body Electric," but 
the story goes places that those stories do not.  It would be a spoiler 
to say how, but eventually we are introduced a friend for David, a 
Gigolobot named Gigolo Joe, programmed to dance through life as he 
performs his Gigolo function.  That programming cannot be dropped even 
when he is on the run for his life.  Like David's, his programming 
outlives its purpose.
Spielberg (or whoever) did a fairly good job of setting the story in 
some indeterminate future.  For once an automobile looks like it might 
have come from a future world.  In the first part the whole world seems 
subdued.  We go from one scene shot with a filter to give a hazy image, 
then we go to another scene with a lot of fractured pieces coming 
together.  A crisper image is used for the middle section of the film 
and toward the end the camera returns to a soft focus.  David, the main 
character, has a special makeup that makes his skin look glossy like 
smooth plastic.  Most of the film is shot in cold lifeless colors, 
though there are some reds and earth tones in the middle section of the 
film.  The middle section also has a faster pace with images suddenly 
coming very fast at the viewer.  It is like going from sensory 
deprivation to sensory overload.  The final part of the film is again 
slow and introspective.  Most Dreamworks films work an image of the 
moon into the story someplace, more or less as their trademark.  A.I.  
goes a little overboard in giving us a moon image that is hard to miss.
Several celebrity voices are used in the film, though frequently they 
are only subliminally noticeable.  I recognized Robin Williams as the 
voice of a futuristic vending machine, but reading the end-credits I 
realized I had missed several of the others.  It should make for an 
interesting game for owners of the future DVD to search out the other 
voices.
Steven Spielberg was perhaps a very good choice as a replacement for 
Kubrick.  A director of some stature was needed, but also because few 
directors could handle the poignancy of the final parts of the story.  
The film has already been criticized for its sentimentality, but the 
emotion is precisely the point.  Spielberg is one of the few directors 
of mass audience films who are not afraid to put emotion into a film 
when it is appropriate.  The critics who complain about Spielberg's 
sentimentality would rob cinema of much of its impact.  The final 
dilemma of this film is an emotional one and that is how the story 
should be told.  I rate A.I. a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the  
-4 to +4 scale.

Steven Spielberg's A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is a captivating, science
fiction story about the quest for motherly love.  A Pinocchio-like tale, it
features another astonishing, guileless and certainly Oscar caliber performance
by Haley Joel Osment as a robot (`mecha') named David.  Frances O'Connor
(MANSFIELD PARK) plays his human `mother,' Monica Swinton.
Originally the creative baby of Stanley Kubrick (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and EYES
WIDE SHUT), this joint collaboration of Spielberg and the late Kubrick shows
more of Kubrick than Spielberg.  Divided into 3 sections, the movie is two and
one-half parts brilliance and one-half part unnecessary, feel-good ending. 
Reportedly, it is this last part that is uniquely a Spielberg touch.  Kubrick,
who wasn't involved after the development stage, is given only a concept credit.
 The film is also dedicated to his honor.
Set in a time in the future after an ecological disaster has caused Manhattan
and other coastal cities to be under a few hundred feet of water, the movie
features a lot of wealthy people who are coping with the help of human-like
mechas.  These mechanical wonders look exactly like humans unless you penetrate
their skins with knives or X-rays.  What mechas can't do is have genuine human
emotions.  They are, however, great at faking everything, including love. 
Professor Hobby (William Hurt) makes a truly radical proposal.  He and his team
will build mechas who can truly love `with love that will never end.'  David is
serial number one in this new line.
The professor believes that he has found an ideal couple to bond with David in
the Swintons.  Mother Monica is racked with grief over the "death" of her `real'
son, Martin (Jake Thomas, THE CELL), who has been cryogenically frozen until a
cure is found for his disease.  Her husband, Henry (Sam Robards), is a
remarkably unimportant character whose only contribution is to attempt to get
his wife some happiness by bringing David home.
The story raises intriguing moral questions at every turn with the greatest of
these being: what does it mean to love, what responsibilities do we have as
humans and what does it mean to be real?  It also poses such eternal questions
of childhood as David's of, `Mommy, will you die?'  His question takes on extra
poignance since it seems that he will live indefinitely while she is mortal and
therefore quite perishable.  What David wants most of all is to be a real boy so
that his mother will love him.
A computerized teddy bear (voiced by Jack Angel), who asserts `I am not a toy,'
is the film's most endearing character, calling to mind Spielberg's famous and
loveable E.T.  David is the film's most tragic character.  
The intricate script recalls parts of many movies, including Sid's toy chest
from TOY STORY and the bar scene from the original STAR WARS.  Stan Winston's
robotic special effects are amazing, as always.  His pičce de résistance comes
in something called the Flesh Fairs.  These garish and ghoulish spectacles are
gladiator bouts as the World Wrestling Federation would stage them.  Mechas are
chopped up, blown up, melted and otherwise slaughtered to delight a cheering
crowd.  `Let he who is without sim cast the first stone,' Lord Johnson-Johnson
(Brendan Gleeson) asks the crowd.  Humans, who have an organic brain and
therefore no need for a simulator ("sim"), are deemed superior and therefore
permitted to crush those inhuman bits of fake flesh known as mechas.
Jude Law, as Gigolo Joe, is a lovable mecha who befriends and is befriended by
David.  With a snap of his head, Joe can play music to soothe the ladies before
he beds them.  And with a flick of his hand, he can change his hair color.  He's
a love doll, who does not really love, but can only `make love.'
Robin Williams -- who else? -- does a nice turn as the humorous Dr. Know, a
franchised, electronic knowledge dispenser, to whom David turns for advice. 
Content providers who have had trouble figuring out ways to make a profit from
the Internet might look to Dr. Know as a model of possible salvation.
Adopting a mecha into the family has some frightening consequences that aren't
easily guessed.  John Williams's music with its creepy undercurrents reminds us
to always be on our guard.  Filmed in a beautiful haze by Janusz Kaminski
(SHINDLER'S LIST), the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you are sweep
into its mysteries and its characters.
After reaching an absolutely perfect concluding spot, the last act tacks on a
long feel good ending that is more likely to infuriate than to please.  The
result is less than a masterpiece but much, much more than the typical movie
fare.  And it is, thankfully, a summer movie with something on its mind.
A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE runs 2:20.  It is rated PG-13 for some sexual
content and violent images and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ** 1/2.  He thought it was interesting and had
impressive images.  He was troubled by what he thought were many logical holes. 
He also complained that it ended at the wrong place, saying, `not all fairy
tales have to end perfectly in happy endings.'  He, independently, wished that
the film would have ended in exactly the same spot that I did.  
The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

For over twenty years, the late Stanley Kubrick worked on developing "A.I."
Initally based on the short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" about
a child robot yearning for the love of his human mother, Kubrick extended
the tale as a sci-fi retelling of 'Pinocchio.'  Having once been told by
Kubrick that the project was better suited to his sensibilities, Steven
Spielberg took over the reins after Kubrick's death.  Haley Joel Osment 
stars as the boy robot who wants to be real in "A.I."
Anticipation for "A.I." began with a web campaign built around a murder
mystery beginning with fictious researcher Jeanine Salla.  The film,
which doesn't touch on these elements, begins with Professor Hobby (William 
Hurt) explaining the next robotic advancement - a child substitute that can 
be programmed to 'love' human parents in a society where natural birth is 
largely restricted.  His prototype, David (Haley Joel Osment), is brought home 
to Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor, "Mansfield Park") by her husband Henry 
(Sam Robards, "American Beauty"), hoping to snap her out of the despair she's
been in since their natural child, Martin (Jake Thomas, "The Cell") fell
into a coma.
Monica's resistent at first, but her need for a child's love soon has her
making the irreversible 'imprint' that will bind David to her (after
imprinting, these 'mechas' must stay with their owner or be returned to 
Cybertronics for destruction).  David's given Martin's supertoy Teddy (his
Jiminy Cricket) and all is well until Martin makes a surprise reversal and
is brought home.  Martin's competitiveness combined with misunderstandings 
result in Monica abandoning David (with Teddy), who begins his search for the 
Blue Fairy which will make him a real boy, regaining his mother's love.
His journey has him cross paths with other, zombie-like, abandoned robots
trying to keep clear of the Flesh Fair, where cheering fans watch their
like be tortured and destroyed.  David's picked up and meets Gigolo Joe
(Jude Law, "Enemy at the Gate" - this film's version of Honest John).  They 
escape and travel to Rouge City (evoking both Pinocchio's Pleasure Island 
and "The Wizard of Oz") where Dr. Know gives advise that lead theme to a 
submerged Manhattan and David's dreams.
"A.I." is a hybrid that suffers from not being fully Kubrick or Spielberg.
The film plays in three parts.  The first hour establishes David and his
life with the Swinton's and plays very much like Kubrick, slowly paced and
quiet, with a slightly ominous score.  Reflections are significant, making
us question what makes us human when we see David's reflection on the glass
over a Swinton family portrait.  Futuristic cars travelling through forests
recall "A Clockwork Orange."  This part of the film is wholly satisfying.
Spielberg begins to peak through in the second segment.  While Gigilo Joe
and his backstory are Kubrickian (by way of "Blade Runner"), the Flesh Fair's
flying mercenaries (Brendan Gleeson, wasted) and their spotlights begin
the parade of "Close Encounters" visuals (a film where Spielberg featured
Pinochhio's theme of 'When You Wish Upon a Star').  The Flesh Fair itself is a
half-baked concept, a colliseum for the destruction of broken, fleshless
mechas which has more in common with a monster truck rally.  A political
subtext is hinted at by Gleeson's character, but not enough to make the
sequence work.
Rouge City provides visuals which seem inspired by everything from "Metropolis"
to "Roger Rabbit."  Spielberg links religion to fairy tale when David mistakes 
a neon Lady of the Immaculate Heart for his blue fairy.
When the duo arrive in Manhattan, Gigolo Joe departs and the film's final
third begins.  It's here where Spielberg loses his grip with apparent
indecision.  Not content to leave his film at a natural ending point,
Spielberg unsuccessfully plays with multiple concepts involving alien-like
evolved mechas, memory and resurrection.
"A.I." represents Spielberg's second screenwriting credit after "Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind."  While his faithfulness to the Italian
fairy tale mostly serves him well, clearly he had difficulty resolving
the tale.  In fact, in this film which recalls so many others, a bit of
"Child's Play" would have had Teddy kill off Martin, making for a more
economical route to a Spielbergian happy ending.  Several nonsensical
pieces of plotting had me scratching my head as well - why did Monica
drive David out towards Cybertronics, then tell him not to go there?
Why did Professor Hobby tell David he'd meet his makers, only to vanish
from the story?  
Haley Joel Osment once again turns in a performance which belies his years,
although a tentativeness keeps him from hitting this one out of the ball
park.  O'Connor does well portraying Monica's confusion and wrings
real emotion in the abandonment scene, but Spielberg betrays her in the
film's finale.  Jude Law gives a witty reading of sexbot Joe, but the
character never feels fully intrigrated into the story.
"A.I." is certainly more thought provoking than any summer blockbuster
we've been presented with yet this season, but it leaves us wishing
Spielberg had applied more of Kubrick's obssessive fine tuning.

     The first warning signal flashes on the screen with the opening 
credit: "an Amblin/Stanley Kubrick production."  Amblin, of course, 
means Steven Spielberg, and the promise of this collaboration is about 
as reassuring as a duet between Perry Como and Yoko Ono. 
Spielberg is about sentiment, Kubrick was about detachment.  When 
you combine those two approaches, what do you get?  A robot with 
emotions.  A machine ingeniously constructed and programmed to simulate 
the responses associated with human feelings.  You get David (Haley Joel 
Osment), a mechanical device with the look of an eleven-year-old boy and 
a capacity to love and yearn for love in return.
This project, based on a Brian Aldiss short story called "Supertoys 
Last All Summer Long", lay on Kubrick's drawing board for years, and he 
had conferred at length with Spielberg about it.  After Kubrick's sudden 
death in 1999, his friend picked up the baton.  His desire to create an 
homage to Kubrick is understandable, but the movie that came out of it 
is often labored, schizophrenic, self-indulgent, derivative, hackneyed, 
and long. 
The story begins against rolling ocean and a Ben Kingsley 
voice-over informing us that this is the time after global warming has 
melted the polar caps and submerged much of the world.  Livable land is 
now at a premium, most of the world's poorer population has been 
drowned, there is strict governmental control over reproduction, and 
robots have taken over the menial work.  The scene shifts to the lab of 
Dr. Hobby (William Hurt), who explains the history of robots to his 
colleagues in a painfully expository lecture.  When he broaches his plan 
to build a mecha (mechanical device) that can love, he's interrupted for 
a Meaningful Question: "If we create a mecha that can love, can we get 
humans to love it in return?"
This is the central issue of A.I., and it's a straw man.  Humans 
can love anything, animate or inanimate.  We love our cars, we love 
stuffed animals, we love all sorts of things that have neither a heart, 
nor a brain, nor courage.  Stripped down, A.I.'s premise amounts to 
this: love is the most essential of emotions, it is mechanically 
reproducible, and the computerized version is purer and more dependable 
than the human kind.
After a number of years (leapt, thankfully, at a single bound) 
Hobby creates his prototype loving mecha, and it is brought home 
unannounced by Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) to his wife Monica (Frances 
O'Connor) as a replacement for their son Martin (Jake Thomas), who lies 
frozen in a very Kubrick-like cryogenics chamber with an incurable 
disease for which a cure will probably never (hah!) be found. 
Spielberg's screenplay dresses story in logic with the grace of an 
ugly stepsister's foot being crammed into a glass slipper.  For reasons 
passing understanding David is accepted in the Swinton home, programmed 
to love Monica (but not Henry), and provided with a best friend, the 
comatose Martin's Supertoy Teddy bear (voiced by Jack Angel) who 
presumably comes from the shelves of some futuristic Toys R Us but is 
smarter than the cutting-edge David, and wiser indeed than anybody else 
in the movie.
In a cool Kubrickian land of banked emotions, Teddy is pure essence 
of Spielberg, with his rolling gait and his gruff voice and his cuddly 
fur.  And when malevolent circumstances conspire to get David thrown out 
of paradise (if the chilly Swinton household can be so described), Teddy 
goes with him, a steadfast Jiminy Cricket to his lost Pinocchio, 
comforting and guiding him in his quest to find the Blue Fairy and be 
turned into a real live boy so he can go back home to Mommy and bask in 
her love. 
The most interesting character in the movie is Jude Law as Gigolo 
Joe, a robotic sex toy who befriends David and accompanies him on his 
search for the Blue Fairy.  "She will make you a real boy," he promises 
leeringly, "for I will make her a real woman!"  But the performance the 
movie depends on is Osment's; and while there's no denying this kid's 
acting talent, we've seen his trademark scrunched-up face and manic 
intensity before and it's beginning to suffer from exposure and 
advancing age.
A.I.'s 2 hour saga winds through three acts: home, the quest, 
and a resolution two millennia in the future.  Along the way it dazzles 
us with special effects and technical accomplishments, but they perform 
their wonders in the service of a story that is so full of shallow 
trickery, and so cluttered with elements hijacked wantonly from other 
movies ranging from The Wizard of Oz to Planet of the Apes with side 
trips through most of the Kubrick and Spielberg canons, that it abuses 
our patience and betrays the promise of true intelligence that made it 
the most anticipated movie of the summer.

In a movie season when most audiences show a
propensity to see light-hearted or action-packed fare,
a film like "A.I." is a puzzling offering.  The Steven
Spielberg/Stanley Kubrick collaboration about a
sophisticated robot boy programmed to love is an
intellectually demanding film that requires far more
brain power than most summer moviegoers want to
muster.  Stately paced, it is an incredibly ambitious
effort that inspires discussion over its message,
contemplation over its perplexities, and debate over
its cryptic ending.  
"A.I." is a triptych of curiosity, wonderment, and
ultimately, ambiguity.  It is a futuristic story about
a 'mecha' named David (Haley Joel Osment who
impressively strikes a balance between robotic
woodenness and human neediness).  Mechas are highly
sophisticated androids that resemble humans in both
appearance and emotion.  However, none had ever been
programmed to love -- until now.  
The production of David creates a fascinating
quandary.  For, even if he could love a family, would
the family love him back?  And would this technology
somehow threaten the frail structure upon which
humanity currently sits?  This intriguing question,
however, is only explored to a certain degree.
"A.I." veers during its second act, becoming an
adventure film.  David is ultimately rejected by his
family.  However, the adoptive mother (Frances
O'Connor) does not return David to his creators for
destruction, but instead sets him free.  David, who
still loves and may now even dream, sets off on a
personal quest that borrows elements from Pinocchio
and The Wizard of Oz.
The journey is absolutely wondrous.  He meets boon
friend, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sleek-looking mecha
(thanks to aggressive makeup) that oozes with lusty
optimism.  He possesses a sultry charm and his
performance is balletic and memorable.  And the places
they travel to are jaw-droppingly stunning from the
carnal Rouge City and its festive air of hedonism to
the post-apocalyptic landscape of a now-submerged
Manhattan in which skyscrapers jut up like reeds in a
swamp.
In the final act, however, the audience may feel as
confused as they are awed by the spectacular
visualizations of the future.  It is in this final
segment that David tries to find that elusive bridge
between machine and humanity.  But the film doesn't
offer any concrete resolutions.  Perhaps this is
because in science fiction, much of what's seen is a
product of the filmmaker's imagination, and so too are
we left to conjure an interpretation of the final
scenes.  What any of us eventually come up with will
surely be debatable.  
Yet, a sense of wonderment may have been the entire
purpose of this film.  There are dozens of scenes that
emphasize hand-holding.  This may remind you of when
you were young and your parent took you for a walk to
the zoo or some other exotic location (at least by a
10-year old's standards).  You would look around in
amazement although you frequently didn't understand
where you were.  But your parent would continue to
point things out to your delight.  And it seems that
the filmmaker's are perhaps doing something similar
but on a much grander scale.  It challenges you to
look at the incredible sights, to look and try to see
the meaning of it all, and to look and formulate your
own thoughts.
After emerging from this film, you'll feel the fuzzy
sensation that you had seen something
thought-provoking.  "A.I." is undeniably audacious and
technically brilliant.  Yet, it should have engaged us
more meaningfully, given us more answers, and been
more moving.  What it did was to only spark our
curiosity, burden us with unanswered questions, and
leave us in a trance.

Loosely based on the story, "Supertoys Last All Summer Long," by Brian 
Aldiss, and the late Stanley Kubrick's dream project up until his death in 
1999, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is as accomplished a motion picture as 
anything director Steven Spielberg has ever made. Following Kubrick's 
unfortunate passing, Spielberg, who had prior been collaborating ideas with 
him concerning "A.I.," decided to make it his next directorial effort, both 
as a movie that he was passionate and excited about, and as a loving tribute 
to one of the great masters of the cinema. 
The end result of the long, arduous, 25-year journey of "A.I." is a 
science-fiction film filled with endless imagination and wonder; a mature, 
almost devastating fairy tale; and a thought-provoking rumination on the 
importance of love, and determined hope, in one's life. The movie is, indeed, 
a Spielberg production, although it does feature an icy, somehow bleak, 
emotional core that is certainly Kubrickian in spirit, and undoubtedly 
intentional. Using the approach of differing styles of moviemaking (with 
Spielberg more of a wide-eyed optimist) turns out to work extraordinarily 
well in this film's case, as the picture is deeply touching and effective 
without being maudlin, and occasionally sterile without coming off as 
cold-hearted. 
Set in a futuristic setting, following the melting of the ice caps which has 
drowned entire U.S. cities (including Manhattan), Professor Hobby (William 
Hurt) has created a string of mechas--robots with the physical appearance of 
humans--to live in the world. With all mechas having been made into adults up 
until this point, Hobby introduces his most life-like creation yet: an 
11-year-old boy named David (Haley Joel Osment). Programmed to be able to 
love (the first of his kind to be able to do such a thing), David is taken in 
by Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) and her husband, Henry (Sam Robards), as 
a child "substitute" for their own young son, Martin (Jake Thomas), who has 
been cryogenically frozen while they await a cure for the disease he has. 
At first creeped out by David, Henry and Monica quickly warm up to him, and 
in Monica's case, falls in love with what is now her new son. Aside from not 
being able to eat or sleep, David is exactly like a regular boy, delighting 
in mimicking and picking up new information, as well as being able to play 
games. When Martin suddenly awakes from his comatose state and begins to get 
better, he rejoins his parents' lives, and in the process, David 
progressively loses the attention and, through a series of circumstances out 
of his control, made to look potentially dangerous. Forced to get rid of him, 
but not wanting him destroyed by the company for returning him, Monica drives 
David into the forest one day, and leaves him there alone, with only a 
mechanical, talking teddy bear as company. 
Leading up to its release, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" was purposefully 
advertised in an obscure manner that didn't give away much of its premise, or 
hardly any scenes from the film itself. This was the wisest choice anyone 
could have made, as "A.I." is a gloriously creative film that prospers from 
its sheer unpredictability, and constant reminder that it is not just another 
"dumb sci-fi movie," but a motion picture overflowing with exciting ideas and 
relevant themes. 
Believing that Monica will love him if only he becomes a real boy, David sets 
off to find the Blue Fairy from the fairy tale, "Pinocchio," whom he 
earnestly believes is the only one with the power to grant him his wish. On 
his journey, he meets a fellow mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), whose name 
reveals what he has been programmed to do. Joe is a cynic, but forms a bond 
with David, and consequently, helps him to accomplish his mission, even if it 
is a lost cause. It is never clear to the viewer if the Blue Fairy does 
genuinely exist, and this mystery is what fuels the entire second half of the 
film. 
Haley Joel Osment (2000's "Pay It Forward") is a revelation as David, even 
more so than in 1999's box-office smash, "The Sixth Sense," which led him to 
an Oscar nomination. At only 13-years-old, Osment's ability to convey utter 
realism and subtlety in each of his performances is remarkable, to say the 
least. This has never been so apparent as right here, in a difficult and 
complex role as a sympathetic character who is, nonetheless, not real, but a 
machine. Osment must carry the whole movie solely on his shoulders, and he 
hits every note exactly right. Simply no other child actor could have done as 
refined and impressive of a job. 
The cast that surrounds Osment is truly fine, as well. Jude Law (1999's "The 
Talented Mr. Ripley") is self-assured and appropriately cocky and cool as 
Gigolo Joe. Law  plausibly paints Joe as a person (read: robot) who is suave, 
undeniably sexy, and devoted to pleasing women. As the increasingly 
distraught, yet caring, Monica, Frances O'Connor (2000's "Bedazzled") is 
heartbreaking, particularly in the bravura sequence in which she takes David 
on a trip that she knows will only have one of them returning home. Finally, 
William Hurt (1998's "One True Thing") is emphatically low-key and memorable 
as David's inventor, Professor Hobby, who may have an ulterior motive behind 
his creation of a mecha child. 
The technical credits of "A.I." are awe-inspiring. Spielberg regular Janusz 
Kaminski's cinematography is both beautiful and understated, as is John 
Williams' unusually poetic music score. And the production design and visual 
effects, by Industrial Light & Magic, are a sight to behold. There are images 
throughout that will stick with you long after the lights in the theater have 
gone up, especially the depiction of New York City engulfed in an endless 
sea, as well as the haunting underwater creation of Coney Island. 
A tragic, if inspiring, motion picture event, there are impassioned issues 
about humanity that are brought up which will resonate with every viewer. And 
the imagination and artistry which the film has been made with is 
second-to-none. To watch "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is to experience a 
visually astounding and emotionally rewarding triumph that, in time, is sure 
to go down as one of the all-time brilliant achievements in modern 
moviemaking. Stanley Kubrick sure would have been proud.

You know, going into a given Spielberg flick, that you'll be
manipulated.  But there's manipulation, and then there's Manipulation.
And damnifi don't feel Used.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Once upon a time, there was a boy who found a pet alien and a phon...uh,
no, that's wrong...once upon a time, there was a boy who could hear
weird tones and saw the shape of a mountain in nearly everything around
him...hmmm.
Ok, get this: sometime in the Distant Future (though still supposedly
within the 21st century), the Greenhouse Effect will have melted the
polar ice caps, causing the oceans to rise, climates to become chaotic,
and other global Bad Stuff to happen.  Because of this shift in life on
earth, people have to get a license to become pregnant [hmmm...not a bad
idea...] and robots - the likes of which current technology has no clue
- have become essential.
But Professor Hobby (William Hurt.  My, how the mighty have fallen since
THE BIG CHILL.  But I digress) pushes the envelope; more than just
creating helpers for Man, Hobby feels the need to play God, by creating
a robot who can Love.  And what purer love exists than the love a child
has for his mother?
The (robot) child?  One David (Haley Joel Osment), created for mother
Monica (Frances O'Connor) and father Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), who
are in grief over the coma that their birth son Martin (Jake Thomas) is
in.  David is Special, the first of his kind - and that scares the
Swintons, especially when he and Martin interact.  David, hoping to
become a Real! Live! Boy! so that Mommy will always love him, hooks up
with Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), a robot created for those who want to "get
they freak on" with no muss and fuss.  David and Joe ask The
Wizard...uh, Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) to help them find the
Blue Fairy so that David can click his heel three times and wind up in
Kansas, complete with his own Toto in the form of Talking Teddy, The
SuperToy (voice of Jack Angel).
The Upshot:
"Manipulated" is too calm a word.  ohickyfrickinpoo, I've been Slimed.
A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE wasted no time pulling out all the
Tearjerker stops.  It was far too obvious, though; not a single tear was
jerked from my eyes.  In fact, my eyes were screaming out for rest
(aided and abetted, no doubt, by the many snorers around me).
The two faces of A.I. - slow and plodding on the one side, and
excruciatingly cutesy and manipulative on the other - arise from the two
directors who've had their hand in this mess: the late Stanley Kubrick,
and the ever-repetitious Steven Spielberg.  And since Kubrick is no
longer with us, the shoulders that must bear the brunt of this pile of
feces, are Spielberg's.  All the Bad Acting, all the ill-thought out
plotting, all the attempts at jerked tears, all the
emphasis-on-special-effects-at-the-cost-of-a-sensible-story, all the
misguided and terribly unsubtle harkings-back to previous Spielberg
Blockbusters, all the snore-inducing hours between the opening credits
and the closing credits - all of these and more, are Spielberg's cross
to bear.
   -Yet Another Distant Future where the only things that are
    significantly  different, are cars?  Hookay.
   -"I see dead peo"...uh..."I wuv you Mommy";
    "I wuv you too, David; that's why I'm Abandoning you."?  GMAFB!
And if I ever see Talking Teddy on screen again, I swear I'll do Damage.
I was >this

The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Not that it matters a whole helluva lot, but I loved my husband's
prediction that the Black Scientist Chick from the first scene, would be
the only Black person in this movie.  Too bad he was proved wrong - by
the Black Comic Relief robot.  The one quickly offed at Flesh Fair.  And
the beat goes on...
Bammer's Bottom Line
Don't be fooled by the hype: A.I. is nothing more than a rambling,
pointless, godawful boring paean to Spielberg's Neverneverland fixation.
Almost makes me wish I'd given in and seen POOTIE TANG instead.  Uh,
almost.
A.I.:  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (rating: redlight):
ET, would you take your butt home already?  gotDAM, I'm sicka you.

Susan Granger's review of "A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" (Warner Bros.)
Steven Spielberg is a cinematic genius. So was Stanley Kubrick. But 
this unconventional, collaborative effort may mystify movie-goers. 
Some will be beguiled, as I was. Others may be frustrated and/or 
disappointed. Told as a sci-fi fairy tale for adults, the story revolves 
around a perfect robotic child named David (Haley Joel Osment), 
adopted by a Cybertronics employee (Sam Robards) and his wife 
(Frances O'Connor) whose own seriously ill child (Jake Thomas) has 
been cryogenically frozen. David is programmed to love, but those 
around him aren't - because he's 'mecha' (mechanical), not 'orga' 
(organic) - and, therein, lies his dilemma. Like Pinocchio, he yearns to 
be a real boy. But how? When he's abandoned with only his supertoy 
Teddy bear as a companion, he's sets off in search of a dream. Steeped 
in romanticism, the plot is divided into three segments: the domestic 
drama, the quest or odyssey, and then the futuristic underwater/ice 
sequences, a consequence of global warming. This fragmentation 
breeds problems. In the darkly disturbing road trip, for example, David 
meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a 'love mecha,' who takes him to 
the Flesh Fair, a nightmarish carnival, filled with robot torture devices. 
Then the eerie, sentimental third segment evokes "E.T." and "Close 
Encounters of a Third Kind," moving grandly, yet tediously. There's a 
lack of cohesion, a feeling of schizophrenia. Hayley Joel Osment  is 
truly amazing and Jude Law is charismatic. The rich visuals - sets, 
costumes and creature/make-up effects - are stunning. On the Granger 
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is an 
unpredictable, intriguing 10. Love it or hate it, it's a triumph of 
innovative film-making, a blend of science and humanity, and a 
brilliant collaboration of two acknowledged masters.

_AI_Artificial_Intelligence_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        "His love is real.  But he is not."  It's one of the corniest
taglines in recent memory, but it also well sums up the main debate that
swirls around _AI_Artificial_Intelligence_, Steven Spielberg's fruition
of the late Stanley Kubrick's long-gestating project based on the Brian
Aldiss short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long."  Is it possible to
empathize with a protagonist who is a machine specifically programmed to
feel that emotion?  Consequently, is his emotion truly "real"?
        These are indeed valid and troubling questions as one watch _AI_,
but as with a number of films fundamentally flawed in design, execution
more than smooths over most of the rough spots--namely Haley Joel
Osment's extraordinary lead turn as David, the "he" of the syrupy
tagline.  In this future world where robots routinely coexist with humans
in their households and in society in general, David stands apart from
all the other "mecha": he is the first to be programmed with the ability
to love.  When Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), whose terminally ill
son with her husband Henry (Sam Robards) lies cryogenically frozen in a
hospital, speaks the code words that activate David's emotional
circuitry, there's no turning back.  David will always love Monica and
crave her love in return forever--long after she may become tired of him,
long after whenever she dies.
        Thus raises that question: how to sympathize with David when his
feelings are as synthetic as the rest of him, turned on with the flip of
a figurative switch?  Just like any machine programmed to do a job, David
is completely focused on his: loving his "mother" no matter what, never
once questioning this pursuit of her reciprocal love.  Such singleminded
obsession has a distancing effect by design, but any detachment is
bridged by Osment.  Look no further than the emotionally brutal scene
where David and Monica part; only a true heart of ice won't be affected
by Osment's wrenching wails for Monica.  But the true genius of his work
are its fine subtleties: the slight but undeniable differences between
pre- and post-"activation" David; the distinctly mechanical mobility of
his body that belies the deep well of feeling in his eyes, which in turn
belies the potential for danger that can be sensed from within him.
        So when _AI_ moves away from the placid confines of the suburban
Swinton home and into the wild and woolly world of such locales as the
neon-drenched, hedonistic urban center known as Rouge City or--in the
film's most stunning sight--a Manhattan that is all but completely
submerged in water, Osment's David remains a captivating companion on an
increasingly strange and surreal journey.  Along the way David and his
loyal "supertoy" sidekick Teddy (a real marvel of top-notch puppetry,
CGI, and voiceover work) hook up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot
whose name says all one needs to know about his purpose in the world. 
This character, played with an appropriately oily sexuality by Law, is a
bawdy original, but he's mostly around just to provide David with a hand
to hold.
        Gigolo Joe personifies ("mechanifies"?) the most fascinating and
frustrating quality of _AI_: the tension between the opposing
sensibilities of Spielberg and Kubrick.  At times the mixing and clashing
works, as in the first act, where Spielberg apes Kubrick with alarming
accuracy in the chilly, clinical tone and sterile environments; and it's
hard to imagine the famously cynical Kubrick being able to pull off the
wallop that a proven button-pusher like Spielberg brings to the
aforementioned David/Monica scene.  But as the film progresses, the odd
coupling becomes more problematic.  Gigolo Joe and Rouge City suggest a
Kubrickian naughty streak, but they've been neutered by Spielberg, in the
end rendered less edgy than they could (and should) have been.  And for
all the genuinely powerful moments Spielberg is able to wring, his
weakness for easy sentimentality peeks through at the wrong moments--in
an otherwise harrowing sequence set at a "Flesh Fair" where mecha are
violently destroyed for the entertainment of "orga" (humans);and
especially in the film's most debated-about section, the final 30
minutes.  For some it's a lovely and deeply touching coda; for others
it's Spielberg's desperately heavyhanded and completely gratuitous final
act of emotional extortion.  I fall under the latter camp, for all the
schmaltz--however expertly acted by Osment--comes after what would've
been a far more poetic and appropriate conclusion.
        The ending may leave a sour aftertaste, but there's no
discounting--or forgetting--the sights and sounds that Spielberg and the
spirit o' Stanley bring to the screen along the way.  Cinematographer
Janusz Kaminski, production designer Rick Carter, and effects crews at
the Stan Winston Studio and ILM out do themselves in making these
stunning imaginings of the future a cinematic reality.  But the most
astounding effect of all is not mecha, but orga: Osment's transcendent
performance.  His character may not be real, and neither may his
character's love, but his talent most certainly is.

I remember sitting in a movie theater at the tender age of 14, watching
a little film called D.A.R.Y.L., about a boy with a computer brain
trying to cope with modern society and questions of emotion and
identity.  D.A.R.Y.L. was not some overblown, 2 1/2-hour ordeal.  It was
99 breezy minutes of fun fun fun!
A.I. Artificial Intelligence is, too my deep dismay, neither breezy nor
particularly fun.  The level of anticipation of the film, of course,
would be impossible to effectively sate, but A.I. just doesn't cut it. 
It doesn't even come close.
The mystery-enshrouded story is told obliquely, in fleeting glances of
half-explained scenes.  Presumably we are meant to absorb the rich, rich
atmosphere of the film, and for a long while, this works.  But as a
result, much of A.I. is cryptic at best, so you'll have to forgive any
wandering plot descriptions.
In the future, the icecaps have melted, population controls are rampant,
and of course people turn to machines for love.  A.I. is the story of a
boy named David (Haley Joel Osment), not a real boy, of course, but an
artificially intelligent robot who has been programmed to love -- the
first of his kind.  "Mecha" robots coexist with "Orga" humans in a
crowded dystopia, so when Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) brings the first
David model home to his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor), who is grieving
over a mysteriously ill son, she freaks out but eventually develops a
guarded affection for David.  When the son in question returns to them
(equally unexplained), things come to a head, and the robot boy finds
himself a bit of an outcast, a machine that loves people but is not
loved in return.
Without giving away too many plot points, suffice it to say that David
ends up on an adventure throughout the greater New Jersey area,
encountering such characters as the megalomaniacal Gigolo Joe (Jude
Law), a "love robot" with all the attendant baggage, and Professor Hobby
(William Hurt), David's creator and a scientist with a bad God complex.
As David wanders from the safety of home to the wilds of the big city
and eventually, an underwater Manhattan, his journey is inspired by that
of the original robot boy, Pinocchio.  But Pinocchio is more than an
inspiration for the film, it quickly becomes the entire plot, as David
searches for the story's "blue fairy" to turn him into a real boy.  His
robotic teddy bear is a latter-day Jiminy Cricket.  He encounters
villains and even a theme park, much like our animated hero.
Sadly, this becomes an enormous crutch for Spielberg, as the search for
the blue fairy saves him from having to write a real movie.  Spielberg
earnestly apes Kubrick to a fault (he even credits the film to him in
part, a dubious honor I doubt the late genius would have appreciated). 
A Clockwork Orange and, of course, 2001 are strong influences,
particularly in set design.  Later in the picture, Blade Runner is an
obvious reference point.  By the end, Spielberg is ripping off his own
E.T. and Close Encounters, and the jumble of stolen plots, sets, and
characters becomes so daunting the film degenerates into utter nonsense.
The Kubrick connection is worth a little extra ink, because A.I., we
should all remember, is Spielberg's resurrection of a film that Kubrick
had essentially abandoned years ago.  Why he didn't make it we'll never
know, but if the scraps of story Spielberg has woven together in this
movie are any indication of where he was headed, Kubrick was wise to
drop the thing.  As for Spielberg, the sole writer credited for the
film, it is also worth noting that he hasn't even worked on a movie
screenplay since collaborating on The Goonies in 1985.
I don't want to knock A.I. down completely.  Law is a fantastic
supporting player, giving A.I. the levity it needs during Act 2.  The
effects are groundbreaking and phenomenal, and while the science of A.I.
is dubious, its dystopic future is believable and spooky.
But it's the three mini-movies within A.I. that make it so hard to sit
through.  The first (David at home) is excellent.  The second (David in
the big city) is fair.  The third (David's quest for infinity and
beyond) is unwatchable.  By the end, the audience is practically being
spat upon with nonsensical, 2001-wannabe metaphysics and general
weirdness that goes on and on without end.  For what it's worth, the
entire movie evoked laughter and snickering from the audience, but only
the last act brought out the real hecklers.
Mr. Spielberg, your love is real.  Your movie, sadly, is not.

-------------------------------
Written and Directed by Steven Spielberg
Produced by Stanley Kubrick, Kathleen Kennedy, Bonnie Curtis
Starring: Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt
Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and violent images
-------------------------------
"Artificial Intelligence" is one of the most anticipated and awaited movies of
the year -- a project that Steven Spileberg and Stanley Kubrick have talked
about for years - polished and developed for a decade, a project they wanted to
make together. When Kubrick died in 1999, Spielberg decided to continue on his
own. And in a way creating a memorial, a loving tribute, a celebration of his
friend, which will remain in the endless ocean of motion pictures for ever. 
Rumors and expectations haunted its production. Spielberg's and Kubrick's
directorial styles were so different and their visions so diverse that a
collaboration between the two seemed preposterous. At the same time the
expectations were tremendous, the skepticism enormous and the result is truly
the most wonderful surprise of the year. Many have already written about this
film, that is  only pretending to be intelligent, while in reality it's
artificial, pointing on the rapidly sinking numbers at the box-office as proof
of that. Wrong! Infact the split in the public opinions and reviews is the first
sign of originality and a unique vision - the very quality that all
Kubrick-films possessed. This a bold film that isn't looking to please the
popcorn-audience, expecting light, brainless entertainment. This is not
"Jurassic Park 3" and this is not "Fast and Furious". This is a work of art, a
clash of Titans, a collaboration between the greatest film directors of our
time, a combination of Kubrick's cold, razor-sharp intelligence and Spielberg's
warmth, hope and innocence, which makes "A.I." a unique and fascinating
tour-de-force that is unlike anything you have seen and will see in the
future.
The story is as complex as it is imaginative and original. It begins with a
haunting prologue that transports us into a new and unknown world of the future.
The poles have melted, leaving many cities under the raging billows of the
ocean. The recourses are low and everything is rationed -- including children,
because of an increasingly threatening overpopulation. It is in this dark world,
where the more "correct" robots are taking over human jobs and where parents are
struggling for children-licensees, that professor Allen Hobby (the Gepetto and
Dr. Frankenstein in the story) proposes to build a robot-child that will love
the many childless couples. Twenty months later Monica (Frances O'Connor) and
Henry (Sam Robarts) (whose only son, Martin (Jake Thomas), lies frozen in a
coma) receive David - the first "mecha" capable to love and dream. At first
Monica is repelled by David (Haley Joel Osmont). Mr. Osment uses his wide blue
eyes and ingratiating smile to suggest the uncanny creepiness of a living doll,
and the film plays cleverly with the monstrous implications of its conceit. The
fantasy that humans' replicas of themselves will come to life is more often than
not - in the medieval legend of the golem, in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" - a
source of terror and anxiety. Fear is the underside of enchantment, and the
spell of wonder "A.I." casts is tinged with dread. This is the beginning of the
first act. This spooky mood only deepens when Monica activates David's
imprinting function, that will make him love her unconditionally and eternally.
His absolute and unwavering adoration is both heart-rending and chilling (the
way Osmont utters the word "mommy" is one of the most powerful and controversial
moments in the film). But is it true love or is it the program? Is he real or is
he not? The eternal questions that Monica is constantly asking herself, unable
to solve them. But then, by a strange twist of fate, Martin wakes up and comes
home. David is gradually forgotten as the return of the "real" son excites the
parents, and though Monika tries to offer equal attention, it's obvious where
her true feelings lie. Martin is cruel and provocative, constantly taking
advantage of David, who only wants Monika to love him. Things start happening to
David as he tries to compete for love, tries to fit in, to be real, to be human,
but he can't. Henry becomes worried and even afraid of David, saying that "If
David was programmed to love, why not assume that he knows how to hate". David
reads "Pinocchio" and thinks that somewhere out there there's a "Blue Fairy"
that can transform him into a real boy. Suddenly the mood shifts abruptly - and
the picture becomes dreamier, funnier and intellectually riskier - when David is
abandoned, along with his cybernetic teddy bear (with the voice of Jack Angel),
in a dark forest. The dark, delirious second hour is a neon-lit nightmare
odyssey in which the boy and his new friend, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) - a sex-slave
mecha, programmed to pleasure women-must fight for survival in a world full of
robot-hating humans. While David represents Spielberg's warmth, love and
passion, Gigolo Joe (the Fox in this story) is clearly a character from
Kubrick's cold, "motherless" world of decay and dehumanization. And like
Spielberg and Kubrick, David and Joe too hold hands and help each other on their
risky and unknown quest. Obsessed with the Pinocchio fable, David is convinced
that he can be magically transformed into a real boy, and that once he is, he'll
regain the love of his lost mother.
The wonderfully complex screenplay, which is Spielberg's first since "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977) is an ingeniously crafted web of twists,
turns and parallels to children's stories and fairytales with nightmarish,
frightening undercurrents. It becomes an odyssey for humanity, a "Wizard of
Oz"-quest of finally coming home, a "Pinocchio"-fable of becoming a real boy.
The tragedy is of course that we know that David will never find his Blue Fairy,
that he will never become a real boy, but he does not.
Mirroring "Pinocchio" in form, "A.I." (like all Kubrick-films) poses grand
questions and wrestles with problems of eternity: What does it mean to be human?
What makes us human? If a machine thinks like us, looks like us and feels like
us, would we care if it's not "real"? Would we accept it? Is it possible to
become human? Where can we draw the line between programmed emotions and
thoughts and the real ones? Or perhaps in an inhuman world, David is the only
true human? At the same time "A.I." displays the incredible responsibility that
we have for our creations. This film has enough in it to start a never ending
debate, to fill countless volumes. It is also incredibly risky, since Spielberg
expects us to invest our emotions into a machine. And in a way the audience is
part of a very interesting experiment -- expected to answer the very question
that is the core of this picture: If a machine can love, can we love it in
return?
There are not many directors alive that can create a "Kubrick-feeling", which is
absolutely unique. There are some that can copy it, but no one can actually make
it real, make it genuine. Spielberg can. "A.I." bears the mark of true greatness
and portraying sides that we didn't imagine Spielberg possessed. With this film
he enters a completely new and unfamiliar territory that will probably forever
change the way we look at him. Visually and in terms of atmosphere and pace -
it's all Kubrick. The cinematography, the dolly-shots, the careful editing, but
Spielberg's warmth and humanity shines clearly through this icy surface. In a
way "A.I." is an incredible film that combines the very best elements of the two
greatest directors of all time. The cool intelligence, darkness of human nature
and the hope about a better world. Earth is a dark, unfriendly place, reflecting
Kubrick's cynical disbelief in the future. And like all Kubrick-films it's
completely unpredictable, filled with reverting story-turns and character
surprises. The atmosphere echoes Kubrick - mysterious and spooky, an obsessive
tuning that hypnotizes you and though it's difficult to watch at times, you
can't move. "A.I." is immensely complex and presents an entire web of moral
dilemmas, and there are moments where story doesn't entirely compute at times,
but even those moments shine with greatness. At times it's creepy, even
frightening, as if come from "The Shining". There are moments of wonder of the
unknown that can be found in "2001", a murky, dehumanized world from "A
Clockwork Orange" and the warmth and heart that rings of "E.T." and "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind". Nightmares and dreams, shadows and light,
intelligence and heartfelt emotions - "A.I." has it all! It is haunting and
surreal, moving and beautiful. 
The technical side of it is beyond any praise. It seems that Spielberg's well
known crew has pushed the limits in creating a loving memory of Stanley Kubrick
- a legacy, if you will, of love. "A.I." features some of the greatest special
effects since "Jurassic Park" and a visual perfection that only Kubrick could
boast of. Rick Carter's beautiful art direction, somehow reminiscent of "A
Clockwork Orange" and "2001", Janusz Kaminski's incredible cinematography, which
cleverly adapts Kubrick's visual style with backlighting, bright whites and the
curiously evocative visible beams of flashlights, Michael Kahn's dreamy editing,
and of course John Williams' beautiful and strangely distant and modernistic
score that is more subtle and eerie than anything he has ever done before.
Spielberg (following Kubrick) forms the dialogues and the acting to fit and
underscore the atmosphere, rather than to propel the story forward, which is
something that lets you truly sink into this strange and alien world. It's when
all those elements are combined when you get the powerful effect that "A.I."
inflicts.
And of course Haley Joel Osmont - an actor in the true sense of the word and an
artist of his craft that is already above some Hollywood-veterans. At age 12, he
is here expected not only to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but to
explore into the darkest, nastiest depths of human condition. He is sensational.
His evolution from a machine to a "boy", who we truly can love is so graceful,
so elegant and so real, that it would take more than an Oscar-nomination to
honor it. Of course he has an impressive supporting cast. Jude Law is wonderful
- looking and acting like a "ladies' dream", he sprays enough color and zest
into his character to dazzle us, walking on a very thin line between funny and
creepy. William Hurt is truly at his place in one of his best roles since
"Broadcast News" (1987). Frances O'Connor is also interesting as Monica -
David's "mother", who plays in the same vein as most of Kubrick's female
characters, which are hysterical, insecure, but good-hearted and loving (Shelley
Duvall's Wendy in "The Shining" is the perfect example). Spielberg brings also
back his longtime friends like Ben Kingsley, Robin Williams and Meryl Streep as
voices behind the screen.
The third act is dark, terrifying and tragic, with no apparent hope for the
future, which is probably where Kubrick would have cut his production. But in
doing so he would have missed a beautiful and slightly ironic ending that is
Spielberg through and through, which truly adds a new dimension to the movie. He
would have missed that compassion and the love, and humanity - the heart, which
Spielberg always had and which is truly what makes us human. Spielberg is the
golden glow at the end of Kubrick's dark, icy, nightmarish tunnel. It's
beautiful, provoking, frustrating, exhilarating, magical, dark, mesmerizing,
mysterious... I can't wait to see it again!

The safest way to approach "A.I." is to understand it is a Steven Spielberg film
of a Stanley Kubrick production. Kubrick himself decided to not direct the film
while he was alive, thus handing the reins to Spielberg. A noble and satisfying
choice. "A.I." is Spielberg's best and most uncompromising film since
"Schindler's List," deserving of any and all accolades. It is brave, risky,
emotional, disturbing, complex and entrancing. 
Haley Joel Osment plays a mecha named David, a child robot of the future. He is
adopted by two kind, loving, troubled people, Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances
O'Connor and Sam Robards). Their own real son is barely kept alive in a coma.
Henry Swinton sees this as an opportunity to alleviate his and his wife's pain
by having a mecha in their house as a replacement until their own son gets
better (Henry happens to work for a cybertronic company that specializes in
mecha technology). Monica is initially angry and hesistant but eventually gives
in to the idea. She ignores David, hides from him and he only thinks it is a
game - David cannot sense or reason that Monica is suffering. Eventually Monica
"imprints" David by turning on his switch to learn and to love. David does learn
to love but does not know how to use it - he loves Monica, whom he refers to as
his "mommy," unconditionally. But regret begins to figure in the situation when
Monica's real son starts to come out of his c!
oma. There is a clash of sorts b
etween David and the real son unfolding in a series of eerie scenes where David
is seen as a threat, a hindrance to the Swinton's sense of serenity. 
Monica eventually abandons David in the woods due to his innocently destructive
nature. Thus begins David's quest to become a real boy since he feels that if he
becomes real, his mommy will take him back. Along the way, David lands in a
decadent, sinful city called Rogue City where he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a
male prostitute mecha who has the ability to conjure the appropriate romantic
mood by twiching with his head which automatically plays Astaire or Sinatra
tunes. Gigolo and David are eventually captured by anti-mecha rebels who destroy
mechas for sport in a stadium of cheering denizens. David gets away in the nick
of time since he is deemed too human to be a mecha and his search continues for
the Blue Fairy (a character right out of "Pinocchio") whom he feels can make him
into a real boy. 
"A.I." was shrouded in secrecy for years before being unveiled in theatres, a
rare event in this day and age of Harry Knowles and the overhype machine.
Kubrick was known for utmost secrecy, particularly for the misunderstood "Eyes
Wide Shut" which was erroneously advertised as a sexual thriller. It is a
pleasure for once to see a film and not have a clue as to how it will turn out.
"A.I." is unpredictable in a way Spielberg has not been since "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind." The mood and atmosphere do not shift as much as one expects,
though it is a structure comprised of two acts and an extended epilogue. Strange
structuring indeed but you only need to look back to Spielberg's "The Lost
World," which had a fitting climax only to begin again with the setting changed
to San Diego where the T-Rex runs rampant in the city. "A.I." has a deliberate
point where it could have ended with David pleading and pleading to become a
real boy. I will not give away much except to say tha!
t it ends instead with one of th
e most spiritually moving and saddest climaxes I've seen in a long while. 
The performances are all pleasurable to watch. Osment shakes his cutesy persona
for a more subtle twisting of moods and facial expressions from an impersonal
mecha to a mecha with an emotional side that threatens to explode with pure love
and violence. Jude Law is damn near perfection with his cockiness and sexual
allure, though I would loved to learn more about him. Frances O'Connor blends
sensitivity with despair flawlessly as the conflicted Monica. And William Hurt
also displays curiously similar fragmented emotions as Professor Hobby, who is
as close to David as one can expect - only the reasons never seem clear. 
"A.I." begins as a Kubrick film with a chilly air of doom throughout the first
half of the film. The second half veers into Spielberg territory as does the
epilogue (this explains why Kubrick chose Spielberg to make the film since its
Pinocchio antecedents coincide with the latter's sensitivity). But something
strange occurs - Spielberg has told a tale of sentiment without manipulating the
audience's emotions. He is not overtly sentimental, as he has been in later
films. It is a return to Spielberg's confidence and assuredness with the
unsentimentality and harshness of "Duel," "Jaws," and "Close Encounters" - he
chooses to detach somewhat from the main characters so that we can see how the
emotional crescendos in the film affects them. Thankfully the musical score by
John Williams is not syrupy but rather enthralling in its minimalist tone and
style comprised of what sounds variations on a slow murmur. 
So what does "A.I." finally have to say about a mecha like David? Do we have a
responsibility to love a robot even though it is not real? What is Monica's
responsbility since her husband only bought the damn robot which could be easily
disposed or discarded like an older computer model? Is David any closer to
understanding a human's emotions since he has his own, or are his emotions
fabricated based on an imprint in his design? If he can love, can he rationalize
that love? Does he not see that his "mommy" did not love him as he thought she
had? Such moral questions invite lots of answers but can mostly result in
ambiguity, as it should be. Kubrick revelled in disorder, pessimism and
ambiguity. Spielberg revels in order, optimism and clear resolutions. That
Spielberg remained faithful to Kubrick's original plans and storyboards shows a
certain maturity on his part. "A.I." is as intelligent a film as one can expect
- a marvel to witness, and a feast for the eyes and the ears. Br!
avo Spielberg!

PLOT:
Can human beings create robots that will be able to love? That is the 
question that besieges this entire film. A young robot-child is given to 
a real human family. The family attempts to love the child as their own, 
but when their real-life son returns, the jealousy of the real child 
eventually leads the parents to get rid of the robot-child. Left alone 
and in the woods, the young robot sets out on a journey to find a way to 
become real.
CRITIQUE:
In one of the most ambitious films of the year, Steven Spielberg has 
managed to successfully wrestle several key elements together, including 
a great story, amazing visuals, a futuristic landscape, solid acting, 
and emerge with a picture that entertains, touches the heart and digs 
below the surface. It's funny because we tend to take Mr. Spielberg for 
granted from time to time, seeing him more for the movie "businessman" 
that he has become over the past few years, but leave it to him to take 
such a sprawling project, begun by legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick 
and then continued by him (they used to fax each other notes and stuff), 
and create an amazing vision to drive the imagination. But Spielberg's 
grown up, too. He tackles big issues in this film. What is love? What is 
emotion? Why does it suck to be lonely? Emotions and queries that we can 
all relate to in one way or another. And even though this film is 
essentially about a "robot", you can't help but draw comparisons and 
connections to moments from your own life, moments in which you felt 
lonely or hurt or let down or misguided. The truth behind this film is 
that it's really about humans...not robots. The cruelty of some humans. 
The love and kindness of others. The world has become a harsh place for 
many people to inhabit, and sometimes our own ability to shut down our 
emotional core enables us to survive from day to day. But doesn't that 
negate what being a human being is all about? Living, feeling, loving 
and even getting hurt? I don't know.
I'm philosophizing out of my ass here, but I think that the power of 
this film, its greater strength, other than its engaging narrative and 
visual delights, is its capacity to harness that deep-rooted fear in all 
humans. That fear of being alone. That fear of not having anybody love 
you. That fear of not mattering in someone else's life. The journey of 
the robot-child in this film is the journey of which many of us are 
presently a part. Will we be happy in our lives? Will we be loved? Will 
our own love be returned by those whom we cherish? Questions that reside 
in our subconscious, and questions that have suddenly imprinted 
themselves in the mind of the robot-child in this film. And will his 
journey end on a happy note? A sad note? Well, being that this film is 
indeed a collaboration between one of the most optimistic moviemakers of 
our time, Steven Spielberg, and one of the most pessimistic in Stanley 
Kubrick, I'll let you figure that one out yourself. I will say this much 
though, I personally would've liked to have seen the movie end right 
after the robot-child went underwater in the heli-sub and hovered before 
the blue fairy (if you haven't seen the movie, this may not mean 
anything to you, but to all those who have, you know what I'm talking 
about). I would definitely have preferred that type of resolution to the 
film, but then again, I'm not necessarily the most "happy-go-lucky" 
person in the world. Also, I felt like the final 15-20 minutes of the 
film, ran it all a little longer than it needed to be.
Emotionally, this film also delivers with two of the three members of my 
own "movie watching crew" bawling their goggles out (sorry, I tinkered 
with my own tears, but didn't go balls-out on them). It's to note that 
this emotional touch could not have been attained as poignantly had it 
not been for the inspired thespianism (that a word?) displayed here by 
Haley Joel Osment, who has seriously impressed me at this point of his 
young career. A superb, loving, real performance which drives the film's 
significance that much deeper. Add Jude Law to that mix, as well as one 
of the coolest toys to ever have been invented named Teddy (give this 
damn bear his own movie!), and you've got a serious recipe for 
greatness. Yes, I thought the film was a little long, it didn't touch me 
as deeply as I thought it might and I would have preferred another 
ending, but those are all very small flaws in an overall sturdier 
picture that definitely needs to be considered for addition to the great 
sci-fi films from both Spielberg and Kubrick's pasts (it was also nice 
to see the many hommages which Spielberg tossed in here, including to 
his own E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, Lucas' STAR WARS and Kubrick's CLOCKWORK 
ORANGE). In the end, the film strives for so much more than most movies 
coming out these days, that you just can't help but sit up and take 
notice. And once you do sit up and pay attention, you will be enthralled 
by the imagination of it all, the strength of its narrative, its 
emotional spirit and its unique ability to combine great visuals, great 
acting and great insight into the human condition.
