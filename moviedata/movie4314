In AUTUMN IN NEW YORK, Winona Ryder, as Charlotte, is a 28 year old 
playing a 22 year old ("22 and never been kissed," jokes her friend) who 
acts like a 15 year old.  Charlotte's every other sentence is "Wow!"  
>From the beginning we can tell that something is wrong with her.  With a 
bad case of terminal giggles, she looks like she may need to be rushed 
to the emergency room at any time.  Certainly someone with such a 
constant case of nervous laughter will eventually no longer be able to 
breathe.
Her illness, however, turns out to be a more traditional one in this 
modern-day LOVE STORY.  We learn early-on that Charlotte has a rare 
heart disease that will take her life within a year.
No, not about Charlotte's disease, but about the movie itself.  With its 
lush autumnal color palette, it is one of most handsomely filmed movies 
this year and has gorgeous stars to match (Winona Ryder and Richard 
Gere).  But it is saddled with a sappy, silly script by Allison Burnett, 
whose only other screenplays were for those classic films: Red Meat, 
Bleeding Hearts, and Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight.  Joan Chen's fine 
direction can't overcome the problems with the script, which contains 
such gems as, "What's the point of being young and beautiful if it's not 
to keep men waiting."
Richard Gere, as New York Magazine cover boy Will Keane, is a famous 
restaurateur and "womanizer."  The latter malady is a disease as sure 
and certain as Charlotte's heart trouble.  Will tells her that, "if I 
could be different, I would."  He is the type who lies to young women in 
order to seduce them, whereas she is the sort that stops strangers on 
the street to offer help.  Nevertheless, they fall in  love, or at least 
what passes for love in this movie.  
Never is their chemistry really convincing.  Charlotte seems more in 
love with Will's persona than Will himself.  And he appears to love her 
because he feels he's obligated to since he tricked her before he found 
out she had an upcoming date with the mortician.
51-year-old Gere has the incredible good looks to which every man 
aspires.  With long flowing hair that undulates like an ocean wave and 
with a smile that could charm even the most unreceptive, Gere is just as 
handsome as Ryder is beautiful.  "You know what's wrong with people like 
you?" Will's friend John (Anthony LaPaglia), tells him.  "Too much sex.  
It dulls the brain."  Just to make sure that we realize that not all 
movie stars age as gracefully as Gere, who barely ages at all, Mary Beth 
Hurt, in a cameo as Charlotte's doctor, looks older than her 52 years.
Much is made of the difference in the ages of the two leads.  Will once 
dated Charlotte's mom.  Don't worry, they didn't have sex.  Charlotte 
explains that she doesn't mind his being older since "I collect 
antiques."
Will tells Charlotte upfront that they have "no future" other than a 
quickie love affair.  She trumps him with her two word response -- "I'm 
sick."  After that the movie dramatically changes tone from happy, 
happy, happy to sad, sad, sad.  
Later, in perhaps the movie's most pathetic line, Charlotte tells Will, 
"In a year or so I could be the sob story you use to bag more chicks."  
This predictable, would-be tearjerker will leave you remarkably dry 
eyed.  With such trite dialog, this should come as no surprise.
AUTUMN IN NEW YORK runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for language and some 
sensuality and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.

Ever seen 1970's "Love Story," where Ryan O'Neal had to come to terms with 
his love, and the impending death, of the sickly Ali McGraw? How about last 
spring's "Here on Earth," in which Chris Klein was forced to cope with Leelee 
Sobieski's bout with cancer? Joan Chen's "Autumn in New York" is yet another 
in a growing trend of romantic weepies, in which two people fall 
head-over-heels in love, but find themselves being torn apart by one of their 
inevitable deaths to a token, movie-style illness. Despite MGM's decision to 
not screen the picture for review for critics, which causes much controversy 
and talk in Hollywood about how bad it must be, it's with at least partial 
happiness to report that it really isn't that awful. In fact, "Autumn in New 
York" isn't bad at all, and while much of the film simply doesn't work based 
on its worn-out plot mechanics and extremely uneven screenplay by Allison 
Burnett, the actors manage to raise the film up a notch from being a disaster 
to merely a passable, flawed time-waster.
Will (Richard Gere) is a womanizing 49-year-old restauranteur who catches a 
glimpse of the angelic Charlotte (Winona Ryder) celebrating her 22nd birthday 
with some friends at his restaurant. Their eyes meet, and after a brief 
meeting, he can't get her out of his mind, despite the sizable age 
difference. Following an invite to a high-profile gala and a wonderful night 
together, a romance ensues between the two, although Will is quick to point 
out to the poetry-loving, child-like Charlotte that "the only thing I can 
offer you is this--right now." Ah, but Charlotte's got a secret which she 
quickly divulges to him so "there will be no chance for confusion later on." 
Charlotte's got a rare heart problem, and she has very little time left to 
live. So as their love blossoms further, and her time on Earth grows shorter 
by the day, Will becomes determined to find a possible surgery that will cure 
her, or at the very least, prolong the inevitable.
It honestly isn't giving anything away to say that Charlotte is dying, 
because not only do the televisions ads hint around the subject, but it is 
revealed no more than thirty minutes into the film. The decision to uncover 
Charlotte's "secret" so early on is one of the film's problems, because since 
Will now knows about her illness, all scenes between the two revolve strictly 
around their noticeable age difference and/or her heart problem, and little 
time is spent actually getting to know the characters. Relatedly, when 
Charlotte first announces she is sick, the rest of the picture becomes 
effortless to telegraph in advance, so for the remainder of the film all you 
can do is sit and wait for the climactic death bed sequence.
Richard Gere and Winona Ryder are lovely together, and it is their hefty 
acting chops that manage to carry us through the story, predictable as it is. 
Gere's Will is an earnest man who, nevertheless, has a wandering eye and an 
unfaithful sexual prowess, despite his love for Charlotte. In essence, she 
helps him become a better man so that, when she finally slips away, he will 
be able to eventually find a loving, committed relationship with someone 
else. Ryder's Charlotte is a sweet-natured, idealistic soul with just enough 
quirks to become the most original and interesting character in the film. The 
28-year-old Ryder has always been a radiant actress, and she handles her role 
with just the right amount of caring and wide-eyed innocence that makes her 
fully believable as a 22-year-old.
As written by screenwriter Burnett, the supporting cast is disappointingly 
developed and leave either no impression or just enough that it makes you 
wish they were around for more than a scene or two. The one exception is 
Elaine Stritch, both humorously biting and touching as Charlotte's 
grandmother, whom she lives with. The rest of the actors aren't given the 
chance to do much, and they cause the entire movie to rest upon the shoulders 
of Ryder and Gere, who seem oddly shut off from the rest of the world because 
of this problem.
Like all romantic film weepies, director Joan Chen wants nothing more than to 
pluck the heartstrings of the audience, but somehow, as the cards stack up 
more and more against the fate of Charlotte, the movie progressively grows 
ineffectual, and the final scene between Will and Charlotte is ham-handed and 
oddly indifferent.
"Autumn in New York" is a respectable enough love story that holds so much 
promise, yet doesn't seem to have had the screenplay kinks worked out before 
shooting commenced. If anything, the lush cinematography by Changwei Gu is 
resplendent, lovingly painting Manhattan with a fury of beautiful autumn 
leaves and marvelously colorful landscapes. If I didn't know any better, I'd 
think this is what Woody Allen's black-and-white "Manhattan" would have 
looked like had it been in color. It's just too bad the particulars of the 
film itself don't even come close to matching that one-of-a-kind 1979 
masterpiece.

 Autumn in New York (2000) 1 star out of 4. Starring Richard Gere,
Winona Ryder, Anthony LaPaglia, Elaine Stritch, Vera Farmiga, Sherry
Stringfield, Jill Hennessy and J.K. Simmons. Written by Allison Burnett.
Directed by Joan Chen. Rated PG-13.
 I must confess that underneath this gruff, cynical movie critic's
exterior beats the heart of a sentimental romantic.
 I enjoy love stories - good ones, that is. One of my favorites is a
forgotten little gem called "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," which
tells of the love affair of Victorian-era poets Robert Browning and
Elizabeth Barrett. And, of course, there's "Casablanca," the greatest
love story of all. When Rick sends Ilsa away at the end, telling her,
`We'll always have Paris,' I get a bit choked up.
 In my mind, the saddest love story is "King Kong." Boy finds girl, boy
loses girl, boy finds girl again in New York, boy gets riddled with
machine gun bullets and falls from the top of the Empire State Building.
It brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.
 Bringing tears to my eyes, but for a different reason, was the new
Richard Gere-Winona Ryder weeper, "Autumn in New York." This
May-December romance is so artificial, so contrived that no matter how
hard you try liking it, you can't bring yourself to embrace it fully.
 He is Will Keane, 48, a famed chef and restaurant owner and a notorious
womanizer. He's one of those love em and leave em guys. He is
portrayed by Gere, who remains one of the handsomest men on the planet.
In fact, age has added a bit of character and depth to Gere's features.
 But the way in which some of the other supporting players talk about
Gere's Keane and his remarkable good looks for a guy his age, you'd
think he had a portrait of himself hidden somewhere in his apartment
doing the aging for him. (For those who don't know what the heck I'm
talking about, I suggest you read Oscar Wilde's "Picture of Dorian
Gray," or at least rent the movie.)
 She is Charlotte Fielding, a 22-year-old free spirit in the bloom of
young adulthood. She also has a terrible secret. Well, it's not really a
secret. She has a rare, congenital heart condition, and Charlotte knows
she has very little time left. And if anyone thinks, I'm spoiling the
movie, forget it. The film's trailer spills the beans, so don't go
blaming me.
 Anyway, our Charlotte figures, what the heck, why not spend what time
she has left rolling around in bed with a guy twice her age.
 Call me old fashioned, but if I knew my time was limited, I think I'd
find other worthwhile things to do - visit ballparks I haven't seen, fly
to countries I've always wanted to visit. Beg Sophia Loren to allow me
to take her to dinner. That sort of thing.
 Surprising, Ryder is very good as Charlotte. Her character is pragmatic
and confident, and in some instances much more mature than her
much-older lover. Because Charlotte seems so self-assured, so together,
it is difficult to grasp her attraction to the shallow Will.
 "Autumn in New York" contains some of the most lame dialogue I've heard
in years. You don't even hear lines like these on daytime soaps.
 Most of these clunkers are mouthed by Gere: `Man, you don't dance, you
float' and `You're a kid and I'm a creep,' are two examples.
 And those are some of the better lines. Gere and Ryder, under the
direction of former actress Joan Chen, spend a lot of time staring into
each other's eyes, crying, arguing then making up.
 After a while, it is all very tiresome.
 "Autumn in New York" is a pretty movie, with an appropriately sweet
score by Gabriel Yared.
 It is difficult to understand what attracted Chen, who made a very
impressive directorial debut with the acclaimed "Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down
Girl," to this project. I hope it was only to get her foot in the door
of the Directors Guild of America, and that now she will go on to better
and more worthwhile projects as befits her talent.

Susan Granger's review of "AUTUMN  IN  NEW YORK" (M.G.M. Pictures)
 When M.G.M. refused to screen this tear-jerking May-December
romance for critics, it was an ominous sign because studios usually
hide the star-laden stinkers, hoping to get at least one solid weekend
before reviews come out. But it's not that bad. It's also not that
good. Richard Gere plays a 48 year-old, hotshot Manhattan restaurateur
with a reputation as a notorious womanizer and whose picture is on the
cover of NEW YORK magazine. Winona Ryder is a giggly, free-spirited,
Emily Dickinson-quoting, 22 year-old millinery designer who informs
him, shortly after their affair begins, that she's suffering from an
extremely rare and probably terminal tumor which affects her heart. So
is it going to be the "Love Story" of the millennium year? Probably
not. Heavy-handed screenwriter Allison Burnett is no Erich Segal.
First of all, too much is made of the age difference. In fact,
according to her cackling grandmother (Elaine Stritch), Gere even
dated Ryder's late mother.  Plus, he has an illegitimate daughter
(Vera Farmiga) who is Ryder's age, and bartender (Anthony La Paglia)
keeps warning him. Even Ryder bluntly quips, "You've got to look on
the bright side. In a year or so, I'll be this sob story you can use
to bag more chicks." Then there's the soggy dialogue: "We have no
future. All I have to offer you is this - until it's over" and "What
should we do with this moment we're in?" On the other hand, director
Joan Chen and cinematographer Changwei Gu create such intoxicatingly
beautiful visuals that you forget they're cliche-ridden - like the
closer you come to dying, the more luminous and beautiful you
become. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Autumn in New York" is
a sentimental, predictable, melodramatic 4, but this glossy,
two-hankie weeper at least deserved to find its niche.

Richard Gere was mad at the studio for not pre-screening this movie for
critics because that's usually a sure-fire sign that a film sucks. Gere came
out and said that he was "very proud of the film", while the studio claimed
that they didn't pre-screen it because they didn't want critics ruining any
plot points for the audience. Yeah...whatever! In the end, I was going to
decide this one for myself. And to be honest, the studio's action and the
lame trailer for this movie had me expecting the worst. In the end, the
film's wasn't so bad, but it wasn't much good either. It was just sort
of...there.
PLOT:
Old, rich, womanizing man falls for a young, perky girl with a secret. You
know the story...boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again, etc...
Obstacles are thrown in the way of their relationship and the couple must
struggle to make the best of their difficult situation.
CRITIQUE:
A sad, love story featuring a distant performance from Richard Gere, a good
turn by Ryder but a lack of real emotion needed to fuel its supposedly
moving, and unoriginal, story line. Having said that, despite no new ground
being broken with this film, I did appreciate the lead couple's chemistry
(for the most part) and was never really bored during its runtime, in spite
of some overly sappy dialogue at times. In fact, having gone in with
expectations of the worst kind, I must say that the overall film surprised
me as a pretty "okay" time. But in the end, I just can't recommend it
because all real love stories inevitably live or die according to the
audience's connection to its lead characters, and if the characters in the
movie don't "work", the film as a whole suffers. Having said that, I thought
Winona was quite commendable in her role. She was perky when she needed to
be, cute at that, sad when the time called for it, and even angry, when
things got out of hand.
Richard Gere, on the other hand, well...who was the brave soul who actually
believed that he might be able to pull off more than a handful of emotions
in this film? I mean, I like Richard Gere, I think he's an interesting man,
a decent performer, but a good actor, well...not really. How can I empathize
with the film or its characters when I don't really feel any emotion when
emotion is what is supposed to be stirring up inside me at that time? I
mean, I had more tears in my eyes when I found out that Jar Jar Binks was
returning in the Star Wars sequel than Gere did in his major breakdown scene
here! But if you take away the "Gere" factor, the film itself does present
some decent style, via rookie director Joan Chen, a soothing soundtrack and
some nice shots of New York City (natch!). But in the end, it just failed to
"pull me into" its story as much as it should have. And yes, I definitely
could have done without some of the really corny lines and poetry, but then
again, others may think it romantic. I do understand the studio's difficulty
in marketing such a film though. Despite its romantic moments, the film also
deals with a very bleak subject matter and in a very big way. The studio
decided to show only the "good stuff" in the trailer, which may ultimately
bite them in the ass, when couples walk out of the film, disappointed and
surprised to find such gloominess within.
I didn't mind that so much, in fact, I thought another great title for the
film could've been THE AGING WOMANIZER, but the movie itself probably isn't
really worth checking out in the theatres. But if don't mind shlocky
"remakes" of other sappy stuff, like the two lead actors and just wanna get
out of the house...well, okay then! :)

     He (Richard Gere) is a silver-haired womanizer with nearly a 
half-century under his belt, owner-chef of the kind of trendy New York 
restaurant where salad costs 35 bucks.  She (Wynona Ryder) is an 
adorable pixie-haired gamine of 22, from a Manhattan socialite family 
that can afford that salad.  She makes cute hats out of wire, and has a 
bum ticker.  "Nobody thought I'd last this long," she tells him.  They 
fall in love.  As his best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) points out, "she's 
the perfect woman for you -- young, beautiful, and on the way out."
     She may be young and doomed, but she represents three generations 
of her family: herself, her tough old granny (Elaine Stritch), and her 
mother, now dead, with whom Gere once was in love back in the '70s.  
"She never slept with him," Granny assures her, to eliminate any taint 
of something vaguely incestuous,  "She was too old-fashioned for that."  
     For romantic small talk, he tells her about her mother.  "Her 
favorite singer was Stephen Stills."  She is of course too young to 
remember Stills, which probably explains why she doesn't seem familiar 
with this plot either.
     In the beginning they giggle a lot, and she sasses him with smart 
talk.  "Do you think I'm too old for you?"  "No, I collect antiques."  
By the end, there are a lot of brave smiles, and the smart talk has 
turned poignant.  "You've ruined me for other women."  "No, I've saved 
you for them."
     His womanizing is legend, but she starts right in to devote her few 
remaining mortal months to changing him.  When he boffs an old flame at 
a party, she finds out by putting her hand on his heart to see if he's 
lying (he is).  Boy loses girl.  Boy grovels.  Boy gets another chance.
     Gere and Ryder are both decent actors, but they inhabit separate 
spaces here.  It's not necessarily a generation gap problem, although 
today we're much more sensitive to that than in the days when Audrey 
Hepburn was wooed and won by Bogart (30 years her senior) in Sabrina, 
Cooper (28 years) in Love in the Afternoon, and Grant (25 years) in 
Charade.  It may be no coincidence that Ryder sports a Hepburn look 
here.  Perhaps it's just the lack of chemistry between Ryder and Gere 
that turns everyone against their romance.  "Leave her alone," says 
Stritch.  "She's sick.  She's really sick."  If  she's that close to 
death, what are we saving her from?  At least she'll never have to do 
that tiresome "when I'm fifty he'll be.." math.
     There's nothing really offensive about this retread job except the 
time it wastes.  The director is actress-turned filmmaker Joan Chen, who 
last worked on the Mongolian plains with  Xiu-Xiu, the Sent-Down Girl, 
also about a young girl and an older man.  Chen is 39.  She should be 
old enough to remember Steve Stills, and this plot.

AUTUMN IN NEW YORK (director: Joan Chen; screenwriter: Allison Burnett;
cinematographer: Changwei Gu; editor: Ruby Yang; cast: Richard Gere
(Will Keane), Winona Ryder (Charlotte Fielding), Vera Farmiga (Lisa,
Will's Daughter), Anthony LaPaglia (John), Elaine Stritch (Dolly),
Runtime: 105; 2000)
A tearjerker love story, about the handsome Richard Gere as a
48-year-old womanizer and Winona Ryder as a 22-year-old Emily
Dickinson-quoting, hat designer, who doesn't have long to live because
of a tumor in her heart. There's nothing that isn't predictable about
this sappy formula sob story and there's nothing about this flat romance
between these two good-looking upper-middle-class yuppies that is
endearing. It is a disappointing film, lacking imagination, turgidly
acted, and laden with a mechanical script, a real downer after the
director's more sweeping last film, "Xiu-Xiu: The Sent Down Girl."
At Gere's trendy upscale Manhattan restaurant, Ryder is celebrating her
birthday, and Gere recognizes an old acquaintance, Ryder's irascible
grandmother, Elaine Stritch, and she introduces this wolf, whom she has
little use for, to her granddaughter, and right on the spot, they both
fall in love. Stritch goes back to the time Gere wooed her daughter and
left her emotionally upset by jilting her. He also knocked up her best
friend and left her without ever seeing the child. They haven't seen
each other for some time, so I guess granny has a memory lapse of what
she thinks of him, as for some inexplicable reason she helps get this
romance started.
Gere, who is a smooth liar, skilled in seducing women and then leaving
them, unnecessarily tricks Winona into going to a formal gala event with
him. It was unnecessary because this silly girl who loves to say wow, is
dying to go out with him. He quickly gets her to bed, but honoring the
old-fashioned conventions of films shot in the 1930s, we don't get to
see any sex. The next morning the playboy deceptively tells her that he
is too old for her, and then gives her his standard non-commitment
speech, "All I'm able to offer you is this--what we have right
now--until it ends. We have no future."
She cheerfully tells him, "I collect antiques." She also tells him that
this romance is taking place only because she will be dying soon. Ryder
finds him so irresistible, that she swallows all these tired playboy
lines and they go on a whirlwind May-December romance. Anthony LaPaglia
is a loyal friend to Gere, and he also is the host in Gere's eatery. His
job in the film is to say cliché lines that reprimmand Gere for being
such a cad to women. He warns him that if he doesn't find the right
woman, someday when he gets too old to be a wolf, he will be alone
drinking egg nogs to himself on Christmas. I guess in the way this film
looks at things, that would be a terrible retribution.
Gere has a quickie with an old flame on the roof, at a Halloween party,
while Ryder is telling bedtime stories to LaPaglia's children. Gere can
only tell her that he felt like having sex with her, it was no big deal.
This shakes up Ryder, who is the one in this relationship, committed to
telling the truth. To add to the melodramatics, Gere tries his best to
woo her back, thinking of himself as a better man now that he has
suffered from some momentary pains due to her leaving him. This love
story never convincingly goes beyond the depth of two good-looking
people falling in love based on their looks.
Gere's neglected daughter (Vera) tracks him down from a picture of him
that appeared in a popular magazine, and she eagerly meets him for the
first time, wondering if he's a good guy. She is about Ryder's age. Gere
goes through a redemptive phase after talking with her, asking for
forgiveness, which had about the same amount of sincerity in it as
President Clinton's apology to the nation had for his inappropriate
conduct.
To pile on some more weepie scenes, Winona keeps fainting and Gere keeps
trying to find a miracle to save her. When she faints while skating at
Rockefeller Center, a surgeon flies in to save her. Since everything
about this film is manipulative, the odds are 4 to 5 against her living,
since this film is just as corny and as predictable as the 1970 film
"Love Story."
The only good line in the film comes from Gere, when asked by Ryder what
made him become a food guy: He says, "Food is the only beautiful thing
that truly nourishes."
This is basically an exterior movie, as Manhattan is warmly
photographed, but the interiors of the two lovers was never made to seem
warm. The romance never rung true and the stars did not have a good
chemistry together. Gere seemed to be content to be in love with
himself, always smugly smiling while everyone said how handsome he was,
while Ryder was too shrill to be engaging. At one point in their
romance, Ryder when in Central Park, waxes poetic and tells him, "I can
smell the rain." She then coos and makes a contorted face of pleasure,
and with this trite dialogue and mushy call for love, amid the autumn
splendor of the golden leaves beautifully photographed by Changwei Gu,
we are asked to believe that these unreal lovers are for real.

        With such odious films as _Battlefield_Earth_ and _Coyote_Ugly_
meriting advance screenings for critics, speculation could not help but
reach a fevered pitch when MGM opted not to screen _Autumn_in_New_York_. 
Could this romantic drama featuring two established stars (Richard Gere
and Winona Ryder) and a very capable director (Joan Chen) be a big-name
bellyflop?  Or is it the gem whose plot "secrets" needed to be protected,
as according to the studio's official reason?  The answer, however, is
not nearly as intriguing as either of those extremes.  The genteel and
benign _Autumn_ is hardly the disaster cynics have dreaded, but this love
story is also hardly the all-stops-out tearjerker it strives to be.
        The latter fact stems from a fundamental conflict between the
sensibilities of the screenwriter and director.  Chen's auspicious debut
film, the stunning _Xiu_Xiu:_The_Sent-Down_Girl_, was an intrinsically
powerful story that packed an intensified emotional wallop through its
subtlety--which is not exactly the best match for the shameless
button-pusher that is Allison Burnett's script.  Will Keane (Gere) is a
restaurateur with a well-known reputation for womanizing.  When the
nubile young Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) catches his eye and
expresses interest in return, Will doesn't see any reason why this affair
will be any different until his many others--that is, until she confesses
her terminal illness.  It seems like an ideal arrangement, the ladykiller
 who loves 'em and leaves 'em hooking up with a woman who has no
long-term prospects nor expectations.  But, of course, Cupid will not be
denied.
        Chen is able to give _Autumn_ some of the lyrical understatement
that she lent to _Xiu_Xiu_.  The tasteful love scenes do have a romantic
air; the images (captured by cinematographer Changwei Gu) are lush and
inviting, as is Gabriel Yared's score; and the big emotional moments are
not histrionic.  But this is, as written, a broadly formula exercise in
manipulation, and for it to achieve its desired weepy effect, there needs
to be a more forceful hand at work.  The material simply isn't strong nor
convincing enough on its own to wring tears by itself--and how could it,
given some of the awkward dialogue ("I can smell the moonlight!  When did
I learn to do that?" rhetorically inquires Charlotte before the first big
kiss).
        At least the script is brave enough to address the vast age
difference between Gere and Ryder, making for some of the film's more
amusing repartée.  Together, the pair neither smolder nor fizzle; there
is a compatibility, but not one overwhelming enough to make Will's
inevitable changes completely believable.  Individually, though, they
fare better: Gere can do the cocksure bit in his sleep, and Ryder
displays her natural incandescence (though it ultimately contradicts her
character's condition--she maintains a healthy glow even as things
gradually become more dire).
        Perhaps MGM's no-screening decision on _Autumn_in_New_York_ was
simply a way to get it more publicity than it otherwise would have. 
After all, it is still the season of larger, louder films, and something
this quiet--and unexceptionally so--would barely register with anyone.

In the insular world of film criticism, the hot topic last week was the
romantic tearjerker, "Autumn in New York." First, MGM refused to screen
the movie for reviewers, generally a sure sign of a cinematic dog. Then,
stars Richard Gere and Winona Ryder publicly condemned the decision,
asserting their strong support of the finished product (as best I can
tell, this was the only thing either actor did to publicize the flick).
MGM countered by claiming they were withholding the film only to prevent
writers from giving away key plot points. Their argument appeared
suspect at best, given that trailers for the movie revealed those "key
plot points."
On opening day, critics hit their local multiplexes, eager to be among
the first to weigh in on the production. I scanned the reviews and the
prevailing reaction seemed to be "Well, it wasn't as bad as I expected."
What a resounding endorsement.
To be fair, "Autumn in New York" has good and bad points. On the plus
side, there's lots of lovely scenic footage of New York City and Richard
Gere's hair. On the minus side, there's the script and the casting. See,
it all balances out.
Richard Gere plays Will Keane, an incredibly successful 48-year-old
Manhattan restaurateur who is far better looking than any of the
celebrity chefs on the Food Network. He has a wonderful head of mostly
white hair that looks as if teams of stylists spend hours every day
making sure it is tousled just right.
While schmoozing at his restaurant one evening, Will and his hair
encounter Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) at a dinner party. Charlotte
is a spunky 21-year-old revered by her friends for her ability to make
kicky hats that resemble pipe cleaner party favors.
Will, a notorious love 'em and leave 'em playboy, sets his sights on
Charlotte, hiring her to construct a hat for a phantom date. When she
shows up with her creation, he claims that he was stood up and asks her
to try on the dress intended for his date. Miracle of miracles, the
dress  a horrific evening gown draped with dozens of what appear to be
fishing lures  fits perfectly. Like a pair of giddy kids, they head out
for a magical Manhattan dream date. Charlotte, by the way, does not wear
the pipe cleaner hat. Continuity error or simply good taste on
Charlotte's part? You make the call.
To its credit, the story directly addresses the dreamy couples' massive
gap in age. Unfortunately, the filmmakers beat the subject to death. One
particularly groan-worthy exchange has Will asking, "You think I'm too
old?" and Charlotte responding, "I collect antiques."
Regardless of their age difference, Richard Gere and Winona Ryder are
never credible as a couple. During their intimate moments, Gere looks
like he's preparing to bite Ryder's neck and suck her blood. And Ryder
appears as uncomfortable as a cat being cradled in a toddler's arms.
The secondary players represent some unusual casting choices. Anthony
LaPaglia strolls in periodically as Will's best buddy, giving a
performance that seems edited in from a different movie. Late in the
story, when a character requires medical attention, a gifted surgeon is
recruited for the job and I was startled to see J.K. Simmons pop up in
the role. HBO subscribers know Simmons from the addictive prison soap
opera, "Oz," where he stars as sadistic white supremacist Schillinger,
the most diabolical of the inmates. When Simmons started dispensing
medical advice in "Autumn," I fought the urge to shout, "He's lying!
It's all part of his twisted plan to destroy poor Tobias Beecher, the
lawyer who ran over the little girl while he was drunk!" Pardon my
digression into dementia, folks. I now return you to the regularly
scheduled review.
Director Joan Chen ("Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl") catches the viewer's
eye with numerous picture postcard shots of NYC, although her insistence
on using weather and flying birds footage as metaphors grows tiresome.
Meanwhile, writer Allison Burnett loads the script with cheesy,
embarrassing or simply awkward lines. While we're used to hearing movie
characters deliver cumbersome, information-packed soliloquies in order
to provide viewers with needed background details, was it really
necessary to have Will ask his adult daughter, "How is Millie, your
mother?"
Despite the leaden writing, veteran actor Elaine Stritch creates the
story's most engaging character in Dolly, Charlotte's grandmother: a
vinegary, weathered old lady whose depth provides a neat contrast to
Will's Peter Pan demeanor. One small change would have made "Autumn in
New York" a better film. Instead of Winona Ryder, Richard Gere should
have fallen in love with Elaine Stritch. The age difference between the
actors is about the same, but the pairing would have been infinitely
more intriguing. Oh sure, Gere would have vetoed the idea in a second,
but I bet his hair would have been in favor of it.
