"A Day at the Races" was the Marx Brothers seventh
film, and the follow-up to their most successful
film, "A Night at the Opera".  Much of the cast
from "Opera" returns.  The formula of mixing
comedy skits with a few musical numbers and
a romance is repeated.
Margaret Dumont again plays a wealthy woman
cynically romanced by Groucho.  Dumont is the
star patient at a struggling hospital.  Groucho
Marx is a horse doctor who has conned his way into
being chief of staff.  The hospital is owned by
lovely Maureen O'Sullivan (not to be confused with
Maureen O'Hara or Margaret Sullivan), who is
romanced by tenor Allan Jones, who owns a race
horse named Hi Hat, whose jocky is Harpo Marx.
Sig Ruman, the comic foil from "Opera", shows
up as a pompous doctor.  He is the subject of
one of Groucho's best one-liners, "Don't point
that beard at me, it might go off!"
The skits are inconsistent in quality.  Groucho
buys a stack of books from Chico, and it isn't
that funny.  When Groucho fakes a long distance
phone call from Leonard Ceeley to Florida, it
is funny.  When the Marx Brothers turn a medical
examination into chaos, it is very funny.
As in "Opera", there are some unnecessary musical
numbers.  Jones may be a fine tenor, but his
songs are empty.  The big production number
featuring dancer Vivien Fay is out of place.
Chico and Harpo take turns on a piano, with Chico
showing greater skill.  Harpo plays the harp, but
it isn't funny and never will be.  One musical
sequence is almost surreal: Harpo plays Pied Piper
for about fifty blacks, who dance and sing with
much greater energy than their white counterparts.
