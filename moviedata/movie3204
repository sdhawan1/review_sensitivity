Review for Third Miracle, The (1999)

     In the immortal words of singer Fats Waller, "I believe in
miracles...."  Who else is a believer?  Agnieszka Holland, best known
for poetic period pieces like WASHINGTON SQUARE and trite garbage like
TOTAL ECLIPSE, who finally ventures into the modern era (or reasonably
modern: 1979) with THE THIRD MIRACLE.
     Based on the poorly-received novel of the same name, THE THIRD
MIRACLE follows a down-and-out drunk of a priest named Frank Shore
(Harris), on his assignment to debunk (or bunk) a claim of sainthood
regarding a Chicago woman named Helen.  The main case for sainthood?  A
young girl who prayed to the woman has been cured of lupus.  Now the
statue where that girl prayed is crying Helen's Type-A human blood.
People are flocking from around the nation.
     Shore, a man of lost faith who lives in a tenement building, is
called back to active service thanks to a perfect record of finding
fault with every saint applicant that crosses his path.  During his
investigation, he reexamines that faith, spars with an archrival
Archbishop (Mueller-Stahl), has a very unlikely and unbelievable fling
with Helen's daughter (Heche), and generally becomes an all-around good
guy.
     The film, on the whole, is intriguing and keeps your interest
throughout.  It's hardly a laugh riot:  This is serious stuff, and
oftentimes it's a damnation of Catholicism.  It's DOGMA, but with
feeling.  But the film's self-importance and rambling, often-lost
narrative (a perpetual problem in Holland's work) robs it of its
luster.  For religion buffs, it's a must-see.  For the typical
moviegoer, it's a toss-up.
     One question by way of spoiler (quit reading now if you intend to
see the film):  What's the deal with the title?  Catholic tradition
requires three miracles for sainthood, and Helen languishes with a mere
two.  At the film's end, Anne Heche shows up with a newborn daughter.  A
more cynical critic might point out that *that* would be a miracle
indeed.

A little slow in getting started, "Third Miracle" builds well, Ed Harris
filling the screen with brilliant acting.
Tip-toeing along some of the same lines as "Stigmata," this film sheds a
kinder light on Catholics and dwells more on contemplation than graphics. Ed
plays a doubting Thomas priest and postulator (spiritual detective) who is
sent to investigate the miracle of a crying statue and verify a woman
(Barbara Sukowa) who abandoned her daughter (Anne Heche) as a genuine
American saint. But the film is really about Ed's internal struggle with
doubt.
The press kit provides this appropriately profound quote from charismatic
genius Albert Einstein, "There are only two ways to live your life. One is
as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a
miracle."

THIRD MIRACLE, THE (director: Agnieszka Holland; screenwriters: John
Romano/based on the novel by Richard Vetere; cinematographer: Jerzy
Zielinski; editor: David J. Siegel; cast: Ed Harris (the Rev. Frank
Shore), Anne Heche (Roxanna Witkowski), Armin Mueller-Stahl (Archbishop
Werner), Barbara Sukowa (Helen O'Regan), Charles Haid (Bishop Cahill),
Jean-Louis Roux (Cardinal Sarrazin), Ken James (Father Paul Panak),
Caterina Scorsone (Maria Witkowski), James Gallanders (Brother Gregory),
Michael Rispoli (John Leone), 1999)
A serious but stiffly told story of how miracles are proven by the Roman
Catholic Church and how the church goes about choosing a saint. The
film's leaden pace and pancake look and wooden acting, are all major
detractions. The only possible exception in the thespian department,
comes from the unfettered performance by Ed Harris as Father Frank
Shore, the one questioning his faith while acting as the postulator-a
priest appointed by the church authorities to investigate if a sainthood
is warranted. At least, he was lively and looked as if he was into the
part.
This detective-like story revolves around the church's investigation of
the would-be saint, an ordinary, illiterate, laywoman, Helen O'Regan
(Barbara Sukowa), who immigrated to Chicago from Austria after WW 11.
During the investigation some mysterious circumstances about her early
childhood crops up, even disputing where she was born. She lived in the
church's rectory and ran a soup kitchen there, giving of herself to the
poor Polish-American community, which looks like a replica of bombed-out
Germany after WW11.
I'm not a believer in miracles, nor am I disbeliever in miracles. I just
don't think an orthodox religion, one that demands blind faith and
obedience from its members can find the truth about such spiritual
matters (that's why I'm a non-believer in orthodox religions). For me, a
miracle is when someone overcomes their karma and finds enlightenment,
and is able to be filled with love, living without illusions, who can
convey this feeling to others and make the world a little better place
to live in. The only proof needed for such a miracle is in the freedom
felt from within, by the person experiencing it. But for those who are
believers in the orthodox, needing some proof that God can hear their
prays, then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch,
supposedly, can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles
are documented by the church. But, unfortunately, the story is not able
to overcome the handicaps of its plodding story and therefore it fails
to materialize as a credible one.
The 52-year-old, Polish-born director, Agnieszka Holland, raised in a
Communist country, whose father was Jewish and mother was a Catholic, is
supposedly a practicing Catholic, which might explain why her adopted
religion is treated with kid gloves and only marginally criticized. In
my opinion, the process of choosing a saint is just as much political as
religious, and the director waffled in which direction to go. In the
end, she chose to cop-out, with one of those slick, unsatisfactory
modern endings, which is contrary to the underpinnings of this very
European-styled film. It results in a draw between the rivals within the
church structure, and who feels satisified walking away from an event
and not having a winner!
In Chicago, circa 1979, a priest (Rispoli) who is a friend and colleague
of Father Frank, finds him living in an inner-city shelter, collecting
himself from the growing doubts he has about being a priest. He is being
called back to service by Bishop Cahill (Haid), whom he has worked for
in the past, having developed the reputation because of his cynicism of
being "the miracle killer," after finding proof to deny sainthood in
another case.
He confesses to a friend, that he became a priest not because he was
chosen, but because his policeman father was shot while he was a
teen-ager and he prayed to God that if his father lives he will become a
priest and dedicate his life to God. His father lived- but three months
later after he entered the seminary- his father died.
The politically-motivated bishop assigns him the role of postulator in
the O'Regan case, after being pressured by local officials that a statue
that Helen prayed to, of the Virgin Mother, is tearing blood. Blood
samples taken from the statue will test positive for the same blood-type
Helen had. This only happens in November, the month the would-be saint
died, and the working-class believers gather there to receive her
blessings. There is no rational explanation for this occurrence.
Since there are three confirmed miracles needed as a prerequisite to
confirm a saint, the postulator prepares his report (positio) on her in
detail, trying to gather evidence of her miracles. This will be
submitted to the Church's upper echelons. If favorable, the church
officials may forward the case to Rome for final approval.
The priest gets someone to help him collect evidence, a true believer,
Brother Gregory (Gallanders). He then meets the putative saint's
daughter, Roxanna (Heche), who feels her mother abandoned her to the
church and withheld her love from her. She therefore refuses to help in
the investigation. The priest finds her attractive and in his search for
the truth, which becomes as much about finding himself than in getting
to the truth about his subject, he battles the church's belief that
miracles are real and can actually be proved by science if they are
authentic. He is also battling his inner feelings of doubt, and his
recurring bouts of lust are added to this battle scenario.
The priest discovers he has a carnal interest in Roxanna, which he is
able to resolve, but it is done in such a banal way, with no chemistry
between the two to justify their relationship, or does their
relationship result in finding anything significant to say about a
priest thinking like a man.
After that relationship, Father Frank's steadfast mission becomes to get
the sainthood for Helen, as if that will make him a believer again. He
is opposed by the disdainful Archbishop Werner (Armin Mueller-Stahl),
"the devil's advocate," who talks in a muffled German accent, as if he
were playing Brando's Godfather part and had wads of cotton stuck in his
mouth. The rivalry between these two sparked no particular interest,
seeming like old hat seen in countless films, a battle between a man of
the people and a snob favoring the elite, as their battle of wits seemed
witless, being fought in a room with a long table before them like they
were in a board room of a business corporation.
The filmed just died from exhaustion and couldn't be revived like the
girl who had lupus was. Maria Witkowski's (Scorsone) unexplained
recovery from that incurable disease, after being touched by Helen, is
the miracle that the church is now examining for authenticity, even if
she lived only to become a teenage junkie and prostitute. But she was
not so lucky, after a severe beating from a pimp, she was placed on life
support. But she was again miraculously revived when she was taken off
life support, as if it Helen was still with her. Is this too a miracle?
It was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it, as the
acting was stilted and the
process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really
happens in the church back rooms. I found it impossible to believe
anything Father Frank found about Helen would, necessarily, make her a
saint, except for political reasons to satisfy the faithful. I don't
know what I learned from this film, or what the film tried to deliver as
a message. But I do know that the story failed to keep me from yawning,
as I preferred the much more flawed recent miracle film, Stigmata, to
this one, even though this film had no kitsch like the other one did,
but it also had very little movement and took few risks in the
sober-minded way its story was told. So much for the intelligent telling
of a story, if the story is not convincing. There would have to be a
fourth miracle to get me to believe in this flick.

Ed Harris is a priest who is not sure he believes in God.  Heâs
even less sure that he wants to be a priest anymore.  He seems
the perfect skeptic for debunking a miraculous bleeding statue
of the Virgin Mary.  A least his bishop thinks so.  The Church
hierarchy takes a dim view of these things, and in truth thereâs
something desperately depressing about the parishionersâ
uncritical eagerness to believe.  Set in Chicago in the 1970s,
these are people who go to church every Sunday and beat their
kids the rest of the week  The bishop lives in a mansion and
talks like a corporate manager.  Which, of course, he is. 
Harrisâ priest in the guy in the middle.
If thereâs one word that sums up this movie, that word is
unsentimental.  The Church is convincingly portrayed as a
hard-nosed institution, part corporate board room and part
military barracks.  Spontaneous religious faith takes the form
of a pimp crossing himself or a junkie raising his eyes to
heaven to give thanks for a dollar bill.  Father Frank could pass
for Raymond Chandlerâs detective Philip Marlowe, walking
the mean streets of the city in pursuit of the truth-- God knows
why, for all the good it will do either him or anyone else.  He is
driven to follow his conscience, and following his conscience
will likely make him miserable.
Enter Roxanna (Heche), the adult daughter of the woman who
is up for sainthood (the aforementioned statue is supposedly
bleeding the deceased womanâs blood).  Itâs bad enough having
a mother whoâs literally a saint; add having been abandoned by
her at age sixteen while she went off to serve God and the
Church, and youâve got one embittered young woman. 
Roxanna and Frank have a lot in common, as they discover
after initially bristling at each other.  They become drinking
partners, and well on their way to becoming involved. 
Roxanna is as tough as brass; sheâs had a lot of pain in her life
but she doesnât expect anyone to cry tears for her.  Just like
Frank.  So the last thing Frank wants to do is hurt her. Problem
is, heâs still a priest.  Doing the right thing is impossibly
complicated.  (In the theater where I saw this movie, there
were two little old ladies sitting behind me.  During the scene
where Harris and Heche are kissing, and slowly sinking to the
floor in her bedroom, the two old dears where whispering âno,
no!â? just as I was thinking, âyes, yes!â?)
I wonât reveal which of us got our wish.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The notion of a priest that has lost his faith is almost a cinematic
cliche.  Films often portray men of the  cloth as hard-drinking skeptics
that no longer feel the spark that drove them to work for the big `G,'
until something earth-shattering happens in the final reel that makes
them believers once again.  On paper, The Third Miracle may sound like
one of these films, but it goes out of its way to distance itself from
these films by adding liberal doses of clichés from other genres.
Miracle opens in 1944 Slovakia, where the inhabitants of a war-torn town
flee on foot as air raid sirens signal an impending wave of German
bombers.  As throngs of people head for safety, one little girl runs in
the opposite direction, toward a religious icon in the center of town.
An injured soldier watches as the girl prays for God to show mercy on
her family, friends and neighbors.
Cut to the bad part of Chicago in the late 1970s, where Father Frank
Shore (Ed Harris, The Truman Show) has successfully hidden for the past
eight months when he walked out on both his job and his god.  Shore's
job is a unique one within the church  he investigates miracles,
decides if they're legitimate and, if convinced, petitions Rome for
canonization.
Shore is tracked down by Father John Leone (Michael Rispoli, Summer of
Sam), who drags him back to their boss, Bishop Cahill (Charles Haid,
Renko from Hill Street Blues).  Cahill sends Shore on an assignment to
St. Stanislaus, where a statue supposedly weeps the blood of a
parishioner that died almost a decade earlier.  While the statue only
oozes the red stuff during sweet November rain (insert Axl Rose joke
here), the blood is said to have cured the lupus in a young girl.
Shore, the hard-drinking skeptic, becomes embroiled in the case  and
also with the daughter of the possible saint (Anne Heche, Psycho) - and
we slowly learn why he's earned the nickname `The Miracle Killer.'  The
film also incorporates elements of cop flicks and courtroom dramas into
the mix, which distinctly separates Miracle from its predecessors
without really being too original.  Shore emerges as a strange
cop/priest hybrid that, at one point, tells a low-level pimp, `My name
is Frank Shore; I'm from St. Stan's.'  He delivers the line with a
clenched jaw and a growl, and may as well be saying, `I'm Detective
Corsetti from the 2-7.'  Miracle's denouement is kind of like A Few Good
Men except everyone is wearing robes and collars.
Miracle is based on Richard Vetere's novel of the same name that he
adapted with television producer John Romano (Third Watch, Party of
Five).  Washington Square director Agnieszka Holland capably helms the
film and is reunited with Square's cinematographer (Jerzy Zielinski),
editor (David J. Siegel) and composer (Jan A.P. Kaczmarek) for this
production that was filmed in Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario.  While the
film is a little predictable (I called it very early on), it certainly
looks great and is one of those films that could actually make you
question your religious beliefs.  And any movie that makes you think
can't be all that bad.
1:58 - R for adult language, mild violence, minor sexual content and
some drug use.
And for priests that take the Lord's name in vain in his own house

Finally, we witness a film about priests and miracles that does not condescend
to the audience by featuring superfluous special-effects or a demonic Patricia
Arquette. "The Third Miracle" is a bloody miracle, an extremely well-acted and
thematically rich film by notable director Agnieszka Holland ("Europa,
Europa"). 
Ed Harris stars as Father Frank Shore, a postulator, known by many as the
"miracle killer," who is seen at the start of the film working at a soup
kitchen. He is called back into duty to investigate a woman who may or may not
be a saint but is loved by the people of a Chicago community all the same.
Every November, the people gather to see a statue that weeps blood - this is
coincidentally the month in which Helen O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa) - the supposed
saint - died. There is talk that she cured a young girl of lupus by simply
touching the girl. 
Father Shore has his doubts but the blood is discovered to be real, and the
girl, now a drug-addicted runaway, was cured of lupus. But can there be some
doubt that this is all highly coincidental? Is Father Shore the right priest to
investigate since years earlier he had debunked the myth of another saint and
thus destroyed the faith of an entire community? There is also the question
that a saint would never leave his or her children behind to pursue faith. Such
is the case with the late Helen, who abandoned her daughter, Roxanne (Anne
Heche). Roxanne is angry at her mother and feels she could never be deemed a
saint. 
"The Third Miracle" asks lots of questions and justifiably answers very few of
them. Father Shore may have doubts about his own faith (as most priests do in
the movies nowadays) but this is a job, and it is one he where he must be
nonjudgmental. He has his own emotional flaws, such as the possibility of
falling in love with Roxanne. He also has to fight against the devil's
advocate, Archbishop Werner (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a ferociously stubborn man
who feels the world has no need for more saints or miracles. But sainthood is a
tricky judgment, it has to be proved and tested and Father Shore goes against
all odds in pursuing the truth and, thus, waiting for another miracle. 
Ed Harris does solid work (as always) as the dubious Father Shore, one of the
few actors on the silver screen whom you can tell when his mind is at work. He
has a very touching, effective scene with Heche, as she visits her mother's
grave and they talk about the good Father's flirtations and loss of virginity
in high school. Some of this was also featured in the horrible "Stigmata," but
here Harris makes it all credible and believable. Anne Heche is sprightly and
alive as always...and she shares lots of emotionally implicit scenes with
Harris. 
"The Third Miracle" is not a great film (I am tired of seeing statues weeping
blood, for one, and the ending is abrupt) but it is richly rewarding and
tastefully done. It leaves you thinking about what the church constitutes as
miracles nowadays, and what a saint's credentials should be. Ultimately, it is
a fascinating look at the nature and question of faith in the church. And
thanks to Ed Harris, we almost come close to believing that any miracle may be
possible.

"Will a Chicago woman become the next saint?" asks the breathless
television reporter on location at the site where the dead woman's blood
appears on a statue of the Virgin Mary. Actually, the blood isn't
currently in evidence since it only comes out during the month of
November and only when it rains. Don't ask.
Yes, in THE THIRD MIRACLE it's time again to lambaste and lampoon one of
Hollywood's favorites, the Catholic Church. The Catholic hierarchy is
shown, as always, flaunting their wealth. The local bishop (Charles
Haid) goes to fancy spas where he gets mud packs. Acting like a CEO, he
hobnobs with other wealthy locals at $5,000 a plate dinners. The
nefarious Archbishop Wener (Armin Mueller-Stah), known within the church
as "the devil's advocate," rides in long black limousines and looks down
at the people like unwashed rabble.
The church employs priests ostensibly to discover saints but actually to
prove contenders unworthy of canonization. Chief among these debunkers
is Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris), known as "the miracle killer." A
cynical man, who has long since given up his own belief in God, Father
Shore is convincing as a non-believer, however it is hard to imagine a
time when he ever believed. Although he is shown as a ruthless
investigator in the past, this time he proposes the Chicago woman as a
saint with relatively little digging, one of the many problems with the
script's credibility.
What director Agnieszka Holland (WASHINGTON SQUARE) gives us in the
place of plausibility are lots of atmospherics. On numerous occasions
she has the camera pan up the side of dilapidated inner city buildings
to see the underbelly of low-flying, large jet planes overhead. Their
loud rumble and their dominant size must have some important symbolism.
What that meaning might be is less clear. The same goes for the film's
wonderful, eclectic score. It doesn't go with the movie, but it's treat
to listen to.
Harris, who is miscast as a priest, is given a female companion. Anne
Heche plays Roxanna, the non-religious daughter of the would-be saint.
Roxanna still resents the way her mother dumped her at age 16 so that
the mother could follow God's calling. With attractive leads like Harris
and Heche, think Father Shore might be inclined to break his vows of
celibacy? This subplot is stuck into the story clearly just for the
titillation factor.
If you need to know precisely what saints do once they go to heaven, the
pedantic movie explains this and other mysteries. Father Shore tells
Roxanna that saints are important because they have God's ear, so that
people on earth can enlist the saints' help with God. "Do you believe
all of this?" Roxanna asks him. "You ask tough questions," he replies
after a pregnant pause.
The movie is like that interchange about belief. Masquerading as a
religious picture -- the press kit talks more about saints than about
the movie -- the film doesn't deliver. A movie can poke fun at religion
and still seriously consider issues of faith, see DOGMA for example. THE
THIRD MIRACLE, on the other hand, plays as a cheap mockery of serious
faith. There are few members of the clergy in it that are credible.
When first confronted with the possibility that an American might be
proposed for sainthood, European Archbishop Wener puts down such a
ludicrous notion with xenophobic reasoning. "Is it truly the soil in
which sainthood can grow?" he says in disbelief about America. Disbelief
is what this movie is all about. One thing can be said for it, even if
the picture is balderdash, it is quite well-acted balderdash. Harris, in
particular, pours his heart and soul into a role that's lacking in both.
THE THIRD MIRACLE runs 2:00. It is rated R for some language,
sex-related and violent images, and brief drug use. It would be
acceptable for most teenagers.

Been there, done that? Not on your life! "The Third Miracle" is, for 
my money, more original than other films of its genre, the genre 
being movies which deal with miracles and/or faith, whether of the 
blatant "The Exorcist" type, sentimental like "The Song of 
Bernadette," offbeat like Rossellini's "The Miracle," etc.
"TTM" is not remotely akin to any of the above, or any other film 
about religion. Outside all sub-genres it is, among other things, a 
sort of mystery tale (and a Mystery Play in the medieval sense), a 
detective story, an exploration of the self and of others.
I found it fascinating, beautifully made, and while complex on many 
levels, not confusing. It major focus is Father Frank Shore (Ed 
Harris) who, having undergone a crisis of faith, went to live as a 
layman in Chicago's lower depths, where a colleague from his diocese 
tracks him down
Recalled by his bishop,  Father Frank is given a demanding 
assignment. He is, in the Church's language, a "postulator," a priest 
whom a cardinal appoints to evaluate candidates for potential 
sainthood. Three confirmed miracles are a prerequisite. The 
postulator prepares what might be compared to a painstakingly minute 
legal dossier. This may eventually be submitted to the Church's upper 
echelons.  In turn, the judges may or may not forward the case to 
Rome.
This theological thriller has a solid thread in the person of Father 
Frank whom we follow through his steps and the arcane procedures of 
the Church. The putative saint was Helen O'Regan  (Barbara Sukowa) 
who had come to America from Central Europe after World War II. She 
is said, convincingly, to have cured a girl from lupus. The statue 
the girl prayed at is now been shedding tears and attracting masses 
of mostly working-class Polish-Americans from neighborhoods which 
look (in the director's words) like battlegrounds.
Frank's previous investigations has earned him the nickname of The 
Miracle Killer as he debunked one (or more? it is unclear) cases. 
This has affected him and added to his depression.
Now Frank is shaken up when he has the statue's tears examined 
scientifically, and they turn out to be genuine blood. He also meets 
Helen's daughter, the cynical and colorful Roxanna (Ann Heche). She 
is a non-believer who resents her late mother's having cared more for 
the masses than for Roxanna.
The character and personality of the young woman, her antagonism, 
then her  rapport with Father Frank; the trails the priest follows; 
the  types of people he encounters, his duel (so to speak) with a 
Church committee, are a weird kind of Odyssey. Some people may find 
the film meandering. Not I.  It held my attention at all times. I can 
only surmise that some Catholics could be entranced by matters they 
may know little about. But I also think  that non-Catholics as well 
as agnostics, atheists may find the proceedings exerting a strong 
pull.
A huge factor in all this is the magnificent performance by Ed 
Harris. A complex, complicated, changing man of -- metaphorically 
speaking -- many faces which are also one face, Harris delivers 
acting that is as good as any I have ever seen in what is a 
devilishly difficult and demanding role He is never ingratiating, but 
shows un-showy kindness to the lower classes, including drug addicts, 
peddlers, and prostitutes. His outspokenness with his fellow-priests 
as well as his superiors is not cockiness, but from the heart. He is 
smart, he is quick, he is flawed -- and he knows it. There's a basic, 
deep decency in this man. He has weaknesses, but also practices the 
ancient Greeks' rule of "know thyself."
The rest of the cast lends excellent support to Harris, whether by 
connection with him or by disconnection. The church people seem -- at 
least to viewers who do not have an inside track to them -- 
warts-and-all realistic and human in individual ways.
Are there major flaws in the movie? I think that this a matter that 
spectators will decide on an ad hoc basis. Some viewers may be upset 
by, or feel indignation at Father Frank's carnal lust (I won't 
elaborate). Others may be impressed by the priest's frankness.I 
thought that scenes of Frank's immersion in  wintry waters (as 
symbolic re-baptisms?) were over-the-top. On he whole, however, this 
is the sort of film that one cannot judge for others.
A possible irritation is the portrayal of Archbishop Werner, Frank's 
opponent during the deliberations. It is overdone, makes that prelate 
the heavy of the piece. He is played by the admirable Armin 
Mueller-Stahl who speaks very clear English, but is endowed here with 
the thickest Teutonic accent of his non-German career.
Director Agnieszka Holland presumably is not religious  but has her 
own fascination with the Catholic Church and the subject of miracles, 
which she has studied assiduously for this movie
Born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1948, Holland, the daughter of a Jewish 
father and a Catholic mother, studied cinema at the famous FAMU film 
school of Prague, worked much with, and learned much from Andrzej 
Wajda, the master filmmaker just honored at the Oscars 2000.
She became a prominent member of the Polish New Wave. Her bitter 
movies in Poland were often censored, at least one of them was 
forbidden during the long Russian occupation. In the mid-eighties she 
moved to Paris. Since then she has made "Bitter Harvest" starring Ed 
Harris, about the political killing of liberal, pro-Solidarity Father 
Popieluszko. Then came the multiple-awards winner "Europa, Europa" in 
which an Aryan-looking Jewish boy is drafted in the Nazi army. 
"Olivier, Olivier," "The Secret Garden,""Total Eclipse," and 
"Washington Square" followed.
