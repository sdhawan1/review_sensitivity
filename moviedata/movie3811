     ROBOCOP is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social
satire, one with class and style.  The film, set in Old Detroit in the year
1991, stars Peter Weller as Murphy, a lieutenant on the city's police
force.  1991's Detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department
run by a private contractor (Security Concepts Inc.) whose employees (the
cops) are threatening to strike.  To make matters worse, a savage group of
cop-killers has been terrorizing the city.  On Murphy's first day of duty,
after his transfer from another precinct, these cop-killers brutally murder
him by shooting off his limbs one by one.  (Orion Pictures had to edit this
extremely graphic scene in order to get an R rating from the M.P.A.A.)
     After the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save Murphy
and declare him clinically dead, S.C.I. recruits his remains for their new
"Robocop" program.  Using the remains of Murphy's body as a foundation,
their scientists build a cyborg, made of both flesh and metal.  The cyborg
(Robocop) is half human (Murphy) and half robot; the S.C.I. engineers have
erased Murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program (or so they
think).  With his lightning quick reflexes, immense strength, and
impenetrable armor, S.C.I. envisions Robocop as an indestructible
super-cop: the solution to Detroit's problems.  The remainder of the plot
follows Robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers.
     As a science fiction action-thriller, ROBOCOP is extremely
effective.  Dutch director Paul Verhoeven combines gritty action with
suspense, shocking gore, and spectacular special effects.  Several
sequences in the film, such as the one in which Robocop employs his
extremely precise aim to stop a rapist, are destined to become
cult-classics.  Because ROBOCOP is so visually and emotionally rousing, it
demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words, in a
movie theater.
     Although the special effects and action are exciting, they do not
by themselves set ROBOCOP apart from other films in the genre.  Rather,
ROBOCOP stands out for its accurate and biting satire of American society.
The movie makes a mockery of The Star Wars Defense Initiative, terrorism,
board games, and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors.  These
news broadcasts, which are exceptionally clever, recur periodically
throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense
action and gore.  The satire in ROBOCOP, however, is almost as frightening
in its own way as the suspense and blood.  1990's America, as portrayed in
the film, may seem far fetched but is in actuality (I think) only a slight
exaggeration of the current state of American society.  The humorous satire
in Robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd.  Verhoeven adroitly
balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an
entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary.
     Unfortunately, ROBOCOP possesses several flaws which prevent it
from qualifying as a classic within the genre.  The movie lacks the lasting
impact of such films as THE ROAD WARRIOR, THE TERMINATOR, and ALIENS.
ROBOCOP's main problem, aside from its dumb title, is that it does not
sufficiently develop Murphy's character.  We never learn the degree to
which Murphy (as Robocop) is human and the degree to which he is a robot.
Does Murphy have any human spirit or free will left, or is he merely a
computer following a program?  The script halfheartedly raises these issues
but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action.  Moreover,
it almost completely ignores the question (and tragedy) of denying a man
his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine.  ROBOCOP also
contains several bothersome loose-ends.
     As you watch ROBOCOP, you experience deja vu; you feel as if you
have seen the film before.  In many respects, ROBOCOP is reminiscent of
several other films, including THE TERMINATOR, RETURN OF THE JEDI, and even
DEATH WISH.  However, to its credit, ROBOCOP easily has enough originality
and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off.

When science fiction is discussed by people not accustomed
to the genre and its concepts, they usually associate it
with fantastic tales about little green men and space operas
in distant futures and galaxies far away. In reality, some
of the best and most influential works of science-fiction
had its basis solidly in the Here and Now. The most
elaborate imaginary worlds of the future were actually built
by simple yet logical extrapolations based on the current
trends, like Orwell did in his dystopic masterpiece 1984.
Last decade, one of such dystopic worlds was created for the
purpose of ROBOCOP, SF action thriller, known today as the
great Hollywood debut of talented Dutch filmmaker Paul
Verhoeven.
The plot is set in a very near future that hasn't seen much
change from the Reagan Years. America is run by powerful and
greedy corporations of the military- industrial complex who
thrive through the Star Wars projects and low intensity
conflicts in Latin America. In the mean time, industrial
heartland of America has decayed and once proud city of
Detroit is a pile of abandoned steel-mills and factories,
drowned in poverty and rampant crime. Local authorities,
with their financial power drained through industrial decay,
low-taxes and laissez-faire economics, is forced to turn
public services to private companies. One of them is Omni
Consumer Products, who now runs Detroit Police Department.
However, despite the best efforts, policemen can't cope with
the well-armed criminals and Dick Jones (Ronny Cox),
vice-president of OCP offers new solution - powerful,
heavily-armed and almost indestructible ED 209 robot.
Spectacular presentation of ED 209 abilities, however, turns
into bloody disaster and the Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) is
willing to listen to the alternative plan by young, hot shot
yuppie executive Morton (Miguel Ferrer). His idea is to
combine the body of deceased police officer with the high
tech equipment, armour and weaponry and create the
invincible cyborg that would rid the city of criminals. The
body needed is Murphy (Peter Weller), good police officer
who died at the hands of a vicious gang of street punks, led
by Clarence Bodiker (Kurthwood Smith). The experiment
succeeds, and Robocop project is put in motion with
formidable results. However, Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen),
Murphy's former partner, recognises the body and the human
part of Robocop starts to remember his true identity.
Superficially, the plot of the movie looks like a
combination of comic book clichs: noble man dies only to be
resurrected as a superhero; he fights the bad guys and has
his moment of doubt/weakness before he takes his revenge in
a final spectacular showdown. On the other hand, very clever
script by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner uses such weak
plot in order to spice it up with a destructive satire of
1980s America (like the name used for the latest model of
American car). Especially effective is the use of fictious
three-minute-news in order to illustrate the future world;
two anchors, played by the real-life newsmen Mario Machado
and Leeza Gibbons, present the grim tales about wars,
disasters and human misery with a cheerfulness that strikes
a frightening chord with "news as entertainment" policy of
today's media.
Paul Verhoeven also contributed to this film, offering an
outsider's perspective to the absurdities of Reagan's
America. His background - European welfare-state, with its
own "gentler, kinder" version of capitalism - was a huge
contrast to the dog-eat-dog ultra-individualistic yuppie
culture that flourished in the Decade of Greed. Verhoeven
was probably having a lot of fun by inflating the elements
of those era to the levels of absurdity; it also emphasised
the satirical point of the movie with his trademark use of
over-the-top violence. Nice example is the scene in the
beginning when the unfortunate OCP executive gets
machine-gunned into a small pieces, and the next minute his
friend and colleague uses the opportunity to suck to the
boss. Nausea with the physical violence is effectively
combined with the dark humour. Same is with the very
gruesome, yet funny death scene in the end that can serve as
Verhoeven's comment on environmental problems.
Although ROBOCOP easily falls into the category of "author's
film" and the name of Verhoeven is the first to be
associated with it, the other artists also left their
distinctive mark on it. Peter Weller was very good in his,
somewhat limited role of machine that turns into human; with
its cool, stoical presence of good policeman and good father
he was ideal for the role that Verhoeven himself considered
the retelling of the Jesus Christ story. Nancy Allen is also
very believable in her very un-feminine and very realistic
portrayal of Robocop's trusted sidekick, high above the
usual clichs of women in action movies. However, those who
play the bad guys are, us usual, stealing the show.
Kurthwood Smith is excellent as a sadistic punk whose
glasses give away the intelligence that would bring his
criminal career above the street level, unlike his colourful
stooges (played, among others, by reliable character actors
like Ray Wise and Paul McCrane). Ronny Cox is also shadowed
by him as a creepy corrupt executive, the role he would
repeat in TOTAL RECALL.
Another strength of this movie also lies in a tight (and
"Oscar"-nominated) editing by Frank J. Urioste that gives a
movie, despite a lots of content, very fast pace in its 102
minutes. The visual design of the movie is also very
elaborate, with pieces of futuristic architecture of
corporate and technology in stark contrast with the decay of
industrial wasteland. However, the most recognisable element
of the film is Basil Poledouris' musical score, with its
epic theme that is somewhat inferior to his masterpiece in
CONAN THE BARBARIAN, yet very effective. All in all, ROBOCOP
is one of those rare movies that manage to be funny and
entertaining, yet thought-provoking and dead serious in the
same time.

     Yo!  What a summer we're having!  If you can't find a movie to jazz you
this year then you were weaned on a pickle.  And just when I though 1987 had
peaked, enter ROBOCOP.  Remember how STAR WARS combined a lot of things you had
seen before into something you'd never seen before?  This is like that in
several ways.  Imagine combining almost every neat science fiction premise in
the galaxy with "The Six-Million-Dollar Dirty Buckaroo Terminator."
     Peter Weller, also known to his fans as Buckaroo Banzai, is perfectly cast
in the title role.  After being brutally shotgunned by a gang of ruthless thugs
he is rebuilt as Robocop, the cyborg policeman of the future.  Rob Bottin's
design and execution of the Robocop character is as stylish and flawless as the
devil he made for LEGEND.  But Weller must be credited with bringing him to
life in a deft performance as the man-machine.
     The action is wretched excess.  The only real mistake with the movie was
making the violence so graphic that it requires an R rating.  It could have
been made as a PG-13 so that kids could go.  I hate to have anybody miss the
romping, comic book feel and the witty dialogue.
     This is a movie that rises above itself by not taking itself too
seriously.  I love the way it cuts back and forth between the story and
television of the future.  Some of the commercials and news stories are a riot.
They also form a part of director Paul Verhoeven's convincing and complete
vision of a future world dominated by large, bumbling corporations.
     Plant your tongue firmly in your cheek, fasten your seatbelt, and hang on
to that tub of popcorn.  ROBOCOP is going to take you on the ride of the
summer.

     Let us cross pens. Mark and I have a number of long-running debates,
including one on the value of movies like DREAMSCAPE, TERMINATOR, and
ROBOCOP, and another on the adaptability of super-hero comics to film.  If I
may be somewhat cavalier, Mark tends to feel these films are unexceptional,
while I feel they serve the special purpose of bringing standard SF ideas to
a movie audience generally unfamiliar with them.  On the other topic, Mark
tends to argue that super-heros make poor, or at least silly films that are
not good SF or anything else.  As a long-time fan of the super-hero genre,
especially Marvel's merry mutants, I, of course, disagree.  At least, I feel
the super-hero genre could be made into excellent films--if only Hollywood
tried.
     At long last, in ROBOCOP we may have such a film.  Although flawed,
it's a pretty good action picture--better than BLUE THUNDER or WANTED DEAD
OR ALIVE.  It has a nice score by the gentleman who scored Conan the
Barbarian (really another successful super-hero adaptation).  It has lots of
good lines and funny jokes, including "My name is Murphy," "You're going to
be one bad m***er-f**ker," and "You're fired." It is 100% better than the
scientifically silly RUNAWAY (wherein Tom Selleck battles robots).  Like
TERMINATOR, which along with BACK TO THE FUTURE, introduced recursive time
travel stories to the modern audience on a sensible level, ROBOCOP shows us
a lot of wonderful stuff we've read a hundred times, but never seen before.
The  plot is old stuff, but who cares?  Heinlein claimed there were only
three basic plots anyway: boy meets girl, the little tailor, and boy becomes
man.   For those who care, ROBOCOP combines elements from all three of
Heinlein's basic plots.
     Mercifully, the makers of ROBOCOP take their premise seriously, and
spares us cackling villains and silly sidekicks.  This is a clean, mean
story that owes a lot to the THE ROAD WARRIOR's realistic violence and
BRAINSTORM's greedy, militarized, hi-tech corporations. Mark complains a
good deal about the inconsistencies in this future world.  I think he's
holding to an excessively high standard.  ROBOCOP is not BLADE RUNNER, but
its future (a few Merlin phones aside) is far more completely thought out
than the average SF movie.  It is not up to written SF standards, but I
suspect the producers wanted to make a few bucks and couldn't afford to re-
do everything.  It suspended my disbelief far better than 2010: ODYSSEY TWO
which by contrast (except for the spaceships) seemed to be taking place in
the next five years.  The makers of ROBOCOP have at least made a serious
(and sometimes not so serious) attempt to project current trends out 20-30
years.
     The plot has several weakness that tend to make it easier for ROBOCOP
to bring in the bad guys.  In particular, at one point the main henchman
makes a speech to Robocop admitting that he works for the main villain.
This makes things easy for Robocop, but 1) the henchman is getting thrown
through windows and such like, 2) it is clearly established in the film that
the henchman might suppose mentioning his boss's name would save him.  At
another point a bad guy puts down a perfectly good armor- piercing cannon to
use a crane to drop a lot of metal parts on Robocop.  This is stupid, but at
least the movie has the main bad guy yelling at him to "Stop messing around and
shoot."  Mark also complains that the ED-209 (a robot that the cyborg Robocop
edges out of a job) would not be very effective as a policeman, which is amply
demonstrated in the movie, but it is also made clear in the film that the
corporation doesn't care if it actually works as a cop--their plan is to sell
it to the Pentagon.
     I have a beef that I'm surprised Mark missed.  Cops are being killed
right and left.  The crooks are armed like they just came out of the
National Guard Armory.  The cops...well, the cops carry what appear to be
9mm pea-shooters with nary a shotgun or automatic rifle in sight!  Maybe
these are supposed to be some kind of advanced handguns, but if I were on
that future Detriot police force, I'd carry an AK-47 or a Uzi!
     Overall, though, these are just quibbles.  ROBOCOP is more realistic
than many action movies, including most James Bonds and REMO WILLIAMS.  The
plot is not as tightly wound as that of THE CONVERSATION but it exceeds BLUE
THUNDER by a wide margin.  To this it must be added that ROBOCOP continues
the line of "action" heroines started by ALIEN and ALIENS.  We see for the
very first time without any special attention that sexual equality has
reached the point that male and female cops share the same locker room.
There is no gratuitous flesh, and the heroine is not model-pretty.  However,
she has a mean crescent kick.
     ROBOCOP straddles the edge between a realistic super-hero comic and SF.
If one guy is a cyborg or wears a powered-suit a la the comic hero "Iron
Man," we tend to have a super-hero story. If everyone has a powered-suit, we
have Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS.   It is clearly implied in the movie that
fairly soon there are going to be other cyborg cops, marking the beginning
of the transition to a still more fantastic future.
     ROBOCOP also marks a new level in audience acceptance of technology and
human transformation, and may well point the way toward our own "cyber-punk"
future.  Murphy, as Robocop, eventually overcomes his programming and
recovers his sense of self.  Once having done so, he accepts his new role as
a cyborg-cop, realizing that his previous life is over.  Although technology
not under human control is dangerous ("Star Wars" lasers burn 10,000 acres
in California, the amuck ED-209, etc), technology backed by human integrity
is working for the betterment of all. I was amazed at how favorable the
audience seemed as the movie ended.
     In some non-trivial sense we are all Murphy.  We went to sleep and a lot
of technology insinuated itself into our lives.  Now, as before, it is up to us
to use it for good or ill.  Each time we wake, however, there is still more
technology, and like Murphy, we know there is no going back.  Who knows, Mark?
If you get very very lucky, someday you may wake to see the planets forming
around that star you want to visit.  But if you do, you will find that, like
Murphy, you have said more good-bys than it is healthy to contemplate.
     Rating on the (-4) to (+4) scale: (+2).  Keep in mind that Robocop is
rated "R" for a reason--this is not a "kiddie" movie.

          Capsule review:  Featherweight and violent super-hero
     comic book on film about a cyborg policeman protecting the
     streets of Detroit.  Paul Verhoeven is one of the last
     directors I would expect to make this fun but unoriginal
     action film.
     The place is Detroit.  the time is some undefinable date in the future.
Law enforcement is no longer done by government and is instead contracted
out to the giant corporation, Omni Consumer Products.  Two models of
mechanized policemen have been developed by OCP.  One if the ED-209, a kind
of walking tank combined with the artificial intelligence to take over
standard cop-on-the-beat responsibilities.  The other model is "Robocop," a
cyborg incorporating human and mechanical parts but requiring a human brain
to run the device.  Just as the ED-209s are about to be mobilized, the model
proves to have difficulties and instead, a recently murdered policeman,
Murphy (played by Peter "Buckeroo Banzai" Weller), is robocized and
resurrected as Robocop.  Three guesses what crime Robocop wants to solve.
     In fact, rarely does anyone need more than one guess about anything in
ROBOCOP.  The plot is supremely cliched.  The resurrected-hero idea has been
used many times before, from the "Six-Million-Dollar Man" to Remo Williams
to the Lone Ranger.  The "honest police under corrupt leadership" plot is
done two or three times a year, it seems.  Scenes of hoods shooting at
Robocop to no effect are virtual dramatizations of scenes in "Superman"
comics half a century old.  The only place the script becomes at all
creative is in extrapolations of society some (inconsistent) number of years
into the future.  By the look of cars and clothing styles, this film could
be taking place tomorrow.  As far as the technology and changes to society
(like contracted police protection), the film still could be thirty or forty
years into the future.
     And some things might not make much sense whenever they take place.
The ED-209 is nearly useless as a surrogate policeman.  It is too big and
bulky to do anything but travel on flat terrain and blast away.  Robocop has
only a little more finesse.  If I lived in the Detroit of this film the one
thing that would scare me more than crime would be the possibility that
Robocop might come to my rescue.  There is no better way to parlay a $100
robbery into a $100,000 damage-repair bill than to call on the "Flatfoot of
Steel."  And with what Robocop must cost OCP in police brutality suits, they
could probably hire an army of old-fashioned humans.
     But the biggest surprise about ROBOCOP is that it is directed by Paul
Verhoeven.  This film is an entirely new style for the director of SOLDIER
OF ORANGE, SPETTERS, FLESH AND BLOOD and THE FOURTH MAN.  Although the
latter two films were in spots quite as violent as ROBOCOP, all four of
Verhoeven's previous films were aimed at a more mature audience.  ROBOCOP is
his first film aimed at the audiences who make floors sticky.  Where films
like THE FOURTH MAN had occasional touches of Kurt Russell, ROBOCOP has more
of a tendency to fade into KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE.
     One final comment: Basil Poledouris, who has a nasty habit of giving
films better musical scores than they deserve (e.g., BLUE LAGOON, CONAN THE
BARBARIAN, RED DAWN, and AMERIKA), has once again shown up his director by
making his score the best thing in the film.  Rate this one a +1 on the -4
to +4 scale.

     The Terminator is back, and this time he's a good guy.  In this future the
police force is run as a for-profit division of Security Concepts Inc., and an
up-and-coming young executive thinks he can eliminate crime and get himself a
vice-presidency with his Robocop project.  Peter Weller is Alex Murphy, a
Detroit cop killed in the line of duty, who has been "recycled" by SCI's labs.
His personality is erased, and what is left of him is merged with a cybernetic
body to form an unstoppable super-cop.  The cyborg's computer-controlled
reflexes and enhanced senses and Murphy's 20 years of police experience are
combined to form the perfect vehicle to dispassionately uphold the law.  The
Robocop performs flawlessly until Murphy's personality and memory returns.
     One of Robocop's many strengths is Peter Weller's performance in the title
role.  Limited by the cumbersome cyborg costume, Weller depends on his voice,
and later his face, to show the transformation from emotionless machine to
human being.  The subtle changes in his speech and movement give life to a
character that could have been as flat and two-dimensional as the worst comic
book hero.
     Another strong point is Murphy's partner.  Officer Lewis is a tough,
competent and compassionate cop, everything police heroes have always been.
Her relationship with Murphy helps him reassert his control over the robot, and
also provides a human counterpoint, and some restraint, to the violence and
shoot-outs inherent in this type of movie.
     The atmosphere of ROBOCOP is rich with detail.  Carefully watching the
action in the background gives the viewer a sense of what this world is like.
It's the same level of throwaway details that made STAR WARS a "real-looking"
world.  Comic relief is added by throwing some pointed darts at SDI, toxic
waste, and network television.
     ROBOCOP gets my vote for best film so far this summer, and as one of the
top science fiction films in quite awhile.

Review: **** (out of ****)
When "RoboCop" first premiered in 1987, it looked like just another
gimmicky sci-fi thriller quickly thrown together to make a couple of
bucks before hitting the video shelves and falling into obscurity. It
was directed by Paul Verhoeven, then an unknown director who had made a
few art films in his native Holland. "RoboCop" looked cheesy all over,
from the poster design, to the tag line ("Part man. Part machine. All
cop"), to the goofy title.
However, when audiences went to see it, they were surprised to find an
extremely well-made, often humorous comic book revenge fantasy with an
underlying subtext of constant satirical jabs at American corporate
domination and capitalism in general. A hybrid of B-movies, video games,
and societal satire, "RoboCop" was much more than it appeared on the
surface. It has only been through the passage of time and subsequent
viewings that all its subtleties have fully emerged.
"RoboCop" takes place some time in the near future in Detroit, the city
whose massive steel mills once stood for the grand possibilities of
American manufacturing power. However, when the film opens, Detroit is
sagging. Riddled by crime and lagging in industrial output, the city has
become so pathetic that it has turned to a private corporation, Omni
Consumer Products (OCP), to manage the police departments.
OCP, run by a serious old businessman referred to only as The Old Man
(Dan O'Herlihy), is in the midst of its own struggles. Here, "RoboCop"
take a pointed look at the battlefield that is American business by
focusing on the intensifying battle between Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), an
older vice president who is losing his edge, and Richard Morton (Miguel
Ferrer), the hotshot young executive who wants to take his place at any
cost.
Jones' solution to Detroit's crime problem is a massive militaristic
robot, ED-209, which is brought to life with stunning stop-motion
animation by Phil Tippett ("Return of the Jedi," "Jurassic Park").
Unfortunately, in one the movie's funniest and goriest scenes, ED-209
goes berserk in the boardroom during a demonstration in disarming
technique, and turns a volunteering executive into Swiss cheese. Morton
doesn't waste a moment, jumping right into the fray and offering up his
RoboCop contingency program. "I'm sure we can have prototype ready in 90
days," he declares.
The man who eventually becomes that first RoboCop prototype is a
policeman named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a good-hearted family man
who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He and his
partner, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), attempt to foil a robbery heist
masterminded by evil crime lord and gleeful cop killer Clarence
Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Murphy and Lewis track Boddicker and his
gang back to an abandoned steel mill, and although Lewis escapes alive,
Murphy is captured by the sadistic gang of thugs. After a prolonged
torture in which his hand is blown off and he is shot repeatedly with
shotguns, Murphy is killed with a bullet to the head.
This entire sequence is filmed in bloody, graphic violence, and it is a
major turning point that defies all expectations and puts the audience
on edge for the remainder of the film. Until this moment, the tone of
"RoboCop" had been fairly light-hearted and downright comical at times,
especially during its satires of commercial television. Verhoeven said
he intentionally filmed Murphy's death in such graphic detail for two
reasons. First, he wanted the audience to sympathize with Murphy,
because he dies only thirty minutes into the film after being into only
a few previous scenes, hardly enough for the audience to understand his
character. Secondly, Verhoeven wanted the murder to serve as a kind of
Christ-like crucifixion, with Murphy then resurrected as RoboCop.
(Verhoeven is very intent on the Christ allegorical aspect of the film,
but I feel it's a bit of stretch).
When Murphy is pronounced dead at the hospital, his body is given over
to OCP to become the first RoboCop prototype. By combining the remains
of his body with a massive, technological suit of body armor and
computer chips, Murphy is transformed into a bullet-proof cyborg law
enforcement officer. The only problem is that OCP didn't manage to erase
his mind completely, and he is left with trace memories of his now lost
family and, even more importantly, the vile gangsters that murdered him
in his previous life.
In this way, "RoboCop" becomes a film about identity. Murphy is now part
man and part machine; but he is fully neither, and therein lies the
tragedy. He is caught between two worlds-- the flesh and the iron.
Indeed, he is caught in the crux of other vexing situations as well,
including the dilemma between enforcing the law while existing as the
creation of a corrupt private company that has vested interest in his
not doing his job.
"RoboCop" is a hard movie to pin down simply because it is so many
things. It is intensely violent (over two minutes of footage had to be
cut to avoid an "X" rating), but it is also quite funny. The humor is
sometimes elevated and satirical, and can't be completely grasped on the
first viewing. But other times it is bawdy, cheap humor, such as a
commercial advertising a board game called "Nuke 'Em" (much of the humor
is directed specifically at 80's social problems).
The movie is greatly aided by fine performance by all the actors. It is
easy to overlook Peter Weller as the title character because he spends
most of the film encased in a metal suit. But, like the great silent
performances, his is mostly body language. When, at the end of the film,
his helmet is removed and we see his face again, he makes it a great
melodramatic moment with his sad, dour eyes. When we finally get to see
the two halves -- Murphy and RoboCop -- coming together, it has a
disarming, mystical quality about it.
Like many crime films, "RoboCop" relies a great deal on its villains,
and Kurtwood Smith is simply great as the maniacal Boddicker. With his
receding hairline, intellectual glasses, and sneering grin, he is evil
personified in an ambitious street hoodlum. In every scene he occupies,
Smith chews the scenery with psychotic glee, and many of his lines were
improvised during filming. His character is frightening simply because
he always seems to be in such command of everything around him. He is
the ringleader in the gruesome killing of Murphy, so when RoboCop gets
to throw him through a number of plate-glass windows and reduce him to a
sobbing wimp, it's a guilty pleasure to watch.
Of course, the other star of the film is director Paul Verhoeven, who
quickly rose in the ranks after "RoboCop." He solidified his position
three years later with the Arnold Schwarzegger vehicle "Total Recall,"
and then entered American film lore forever with his two sexy
sleazefests "Basic Instinct" and "Showgirls."
However one feels about his later output, it's hard to deny that
Verhoeven's talents are on full display here. He never allows the
audience to get fully settled because the tone switches so easily from
humor to melodrama to adventure to gruesome violence. And, despite these
drastically varying elements, Verhoeven manages to keep it all rolled up
into one slick package that constantly plunges ahead.

        As long as there are people on this planet there will be two things: crime;
and an attempt to stop crime. "Robocop" exploits that notion by painting a
picture of grim future and then offers a ray of hope through its hero's
actions. Unfortunately, the film tries to maintain a level of satire through
its Gothic atmosphere, and the two moods do not work well together.
        The setting takes place in a typical futuristic Detroit where crime is so
rampant the police force is controlled by OCP - a security corporation that
develops military technology. The CEOs of this company are straight from the
cliche book. There is the old president and two vice presidents that bicker
with each other like little children. 
        The "bad" V.P., Dick Jones (Cox), has developed a huge robot that would
replace human police officers. His model, ED-209, is quite menacing through
its appearance alone. But here is where the film makes the first of many
mistakes - it doesn't seem satisfied with simple mood alone, it goes too far
to define the obvious. ED-209 talks with an evil, computer-generated voice,
and it growls like a lion. There is also the "less bad" V.P., Robert Morton
(Ferrer), who kisses up to the president and has his "Robocop" project
approved when ED-209 malfunctions (didn't see that one coming).
        A need for a heroic figure is quickly apparent here and when we meet police
officers Murphy (Weller) and Lewis (Allen), it's clear who the savior will
be. Murphy is an honest cop who has just transferred with Lewis, who is a
female cop but does not display any feminine qualities at all (which is not a
complete flaw). And as soon as they get together they are separated when
Murphy is blown to bits by a gang of criminals who are entirely too nasty
(they look like The Village People on crack, and talk and act like cartoon
villains). Murphy is pronounced legally dead and is used in Morton's Robocop
project.
        And so we get a superhero of sorts and we just can't wait for him to stop
the rampant crime spree - or at least that's what we're supposed to feel. We
get the obligatory scenes of Robocop using his high technology to stop crimes
other cops could not. But these scenes aren't as exciting as they should be.
Robocop shoots firsts and asks questions later, and he doesn't seem like some
kind of hero, more like a cyborg vigilante.
        Stories about vigilantes, or at least "superheroes" tend to have a bit of
complexity and mystery to them, but this film is virtually plotless as it
wanders between the OCP V.P.s' rivalry and Robocop's recollection of his
former life. The element of Jones' involvement with a nasty mob boss named
Clarence Boddicker (Smith) is a little too predictable. Meanwhile, Robocop
seems to take the law into his own hands.
        The ending follows the story's logical conclusion with Robocop running from
the controlled police force, almost "dying," but manages to take out the
villains anyway.
        Overall, "Robocop" is definitely interesting to watch but it seems a bit
empty. The Gothic atmosphere could have been used much better had the layer
of satire been so distracting. I saw enormous potential here and it really
disappointed me it wasn't taken advantage of.
