There's no shortage of spy or action movies based
on WWII, but "Operation Crossbow" is separated
from the pack by a good script and a tense story.
The Nazis are developing winged bombs and rockets
with which they are devastating London.  British
Intelligence, led by limping Richard Johnson, sends
agents with both German language and technical skills
to the German plant that is producing the rockets.
George Peppard, Tom Courtenay, and Jeremy Kemp are
the agents, whose assignment is to somehow sabotage
the factory.
Sophia Loren has top billing, but her role is
a small one.  She plays the wife of the man
Peppard is impersonating.  Loren's character
was inserted late in production by her husband,
Producer Carlo Ponti, to improve box office appeal,
but her scenes are among the best in the film.
She has a screen charisma that Peppard lacks,
but give Peppard his due: he looks Aryan, making
him a more plausible agent.
There is much tension and suspense in the story.
Since it is a British production, it is inevitable
that British cleverness will triumph over German
villainy, but the Nazis have the upper hand
for much of the film.  The special effects are
generally good, although the firestorm at the
end appears to have been superimposed onto the
frames.
One supporting character I didn't much care for
is a British intelligence officer who opposes
bombings of the German rocket plant.  His constant
but ineffective opposition to Johnson only serves to
build up Johnson as all-knowing.
Still, "Operation Crossbow" is an under-rated, if
minor, spy drama.  I certainly prefer it to
"Torn Curtain", the Hitchcock spy drama from the
following year.
