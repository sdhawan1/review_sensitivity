Many of you may have heard about the newer 3D films that have been playing
at IMAX theaters. This is the one to see. Encounter offers an education on
itself -- the history and techniques of 3-D photography. But don't get the
wrong idea -- at every turn twist and protrusion it's a thrilling, learning,
theme park ride on (and sometimes off) the screen .
An "absent-minded professor" and hovering mechanical pal (Max) host you
through a film that doesn't let you sit back and relax. The professor's 3D
presentation of Elvira (yes, the Mistress of the Dark), having yet a few
bugs, traps her between the third and second dimensions. So while he's
trying to free her from the "second and a half" dimension, hi-tech jokester
Max begins the lesson.
In addition to early photo's originally shot in 3D, you'll see a 1903 clip
from the very first 3D motion picture, tidbits from the 3D fad of the early
'50's, equilibrium-challenging shorts and the 100 foot chrome spider from
Universal's T2 in 3D. You won't be thinking ... "Boy these 3-D glasses are
goofy" ... you'll be thinking ... "If those steel feelers touch me, there's
going to be lawsuits!"
You'll step out of the theater wiser, but nonetheless, wanting to ride it
again!
