As Message in a Bottle opens, we see an expanse of deep, ocean water and
the name, Kevin Costner, is emblazoned across it.  Your first thoughts
are, Is this a sequel to Water World?  But rest assured, it is not.  It is
a marvelous, weepy type of love story that's set in today's world.
Robin Wright Penn, who is always sensational, is perfectly cast as
Theresa Osborne, the divorcee who lives and works in Chicago with her
nine-year old son.  She has brought him to the East Coast to spend some
time with his father, who has remarried and has a new baby.   In an
attempt to relax, she spends a couple of days vacationing on the seacoast
where she finds a bottle with a message inside.  The message is written to
Catherine, and it is filled with love, the kind of love that Theresa wants
and needs.   She takes the bottle and message back to Chicago, to the
newspaper where she works, and her boss [Robbie Coltrane] writes a column
about it.   The column prompts many letters including two that tell of
finding similar messages.  
With the help of her computer and friends like Lina Paul [Illeana
Douglas], Theresa tracks down the sender of the messages.  He is a
ship-builder living in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  She convinces
her boss to let her visit the area for a follow-up story.  Once there, she
meets and falls in love with Garret Blake [Kevin Costner].   
The real treasure of the film is the portrayal of Garret's father, Dodge
Blake by Paul Newman.  This man has certainly aged well.  He's still nice
looking, but it is his believability as the loving, caring parent who is
coping with his own demons that impresses you most.  It is a long time
until next year's Oscar race, but I hope that the Academy remembers him
for a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  He deserves it.
Although most people will say that this is a `chick' flick, it truly
appeals to anyone, male or female, who has feelings.  There were many men
in the audience who couldn't hold back the tears.  If you didn't even care
about the love story, you'll be impressed with the cinematography.  There
are some of the prettiest shots that I have ever seen, not only of the
ocean, and the other beautiful locations, but all the shots are special,
especially the lighting and the shadows of the love scene.  It shows how a
love scene should be filmed.  There is nothing salacious about it.  The
lighting is love itself.  Hollywood should take note that a good movie can
be made without explosions, nudity, or swearing.
It's early in the year to give a high rating, but this has to be at least
a B+.  I do want to see it again, and I'll keep recommending it.

 Director:  Luis Mandoki
 Writer:  Gerald Di Pego, novel by Nicholas Sparks
 Cast: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, John Savage,
Illeana Douglas, Robbie Coltraine, Paul Newman
   Kevin Costner is one of Hollywood's most bankable stars
because he's so congenial.  His flat voice and bland accent
proved apropos in his first starring role as the upright Eliot
Ness in "The Untouchables" and he was as fine a performer
as he ever was in "Bull Durham" and "Field of Dreams." 
Lately, though, he has been defeated by strange scripts that
ranged from the thoroughly embarrassing Mad Max spinoff
"Waterworld" and the movie that people are still trying to
figure out (camp? new spirit of patriotism?), "The Postman." 
Doubtless he was picked for the male lead in "Message in a
Bottle" because he can capture the soul of the ordinary
American, plying his craft with his hands in a picturesque little
fishing village on the Carolina coast.  But "Message in a
Bottle," which features travelogue-perfect photography and
highlights one of Hollywood's most enchanting actresses
(Robin Wright Penn)--as well as the legendary Paul Newman
in the role of a crusty ol' dad full of tough love for his
disoriented son--is utterly banal, an old-fashioned weepie
romance that may call up nary a solitary piece of Kleenex
from the middle-aged audience it hopes to attract.
   "Message in a Bottle" brings to mind the typical error that
tourists make while on vacation, the miscalculation that
makes the happy wayfarer say, "I could live here."  In fact,
spending just one extra week in a distant paradise would
likely yield a condition of homesickness.  The picture features
two people who are at vulnerable stages in their lives, who
could easily find a glowing, romantic attachment, and who
might believe that they could make a go of their lives
together.  In fact, Garret (Kevin Costner) and Theresa (Robin
Wright) are so different in temperament and background that
had they decided to get together for a more permanent union
they would run out of things to say in a month.  Sure, the
chemistry is there, though they do not exactly sizzle together.
Still, the audience might feel it got its money's worth simply
by gazing at the frequent closeups of the handsome couple
who are lonely enough to be an easy target for Cupid's
arrows.  But Nicholas Sparks, who wrote the novel on which
the movie is based, and Gerald Di Pego, who adapted it for
his screenplay, fall back on one of the seasoned incitements
to love: a woman's penchant for a man's lines of poetry.
   The poetry is found in a message in a bottle which Theresa
discovers washed up on a beach.  Opening the rolled-up
stationery, she determines that it was written by a man who
is stricken with heartache at the premature death of his wife,
Catherine, and who feels so guilty at his helplessness that he
introduces virtually every line with the words "I'm sorry."
Since Theresa works as a researcher for the Chicago
Tribune, she takes the note to her editor, Charlie (Robbie
Coltrane), who decides to publish it under his byline and to
research the age and source of the note via the stationery,
the typewriter, and the sort of bottle used to convey it.  When
readers respond, Charlie sends Theresa to the Carolina
shore to meet its author for a possible feature on this newly-
found minstrel.  Theresa discovers the man, Garret Blake,
falls in love by their second day together, and becomes
enamored with the essence of this fishing village that seems
to have sprouted out of the 19th century.  Like all romantic
melodramas, the lovers must be kept apart until the end. 
The distance they put between them is not geographical but
psychological: Garret cannot put his devotion to his deceased
wife to rest.
   Luis Mandoki does a creditable job of directing the
photogenic couple against the backdrop of a fishing town
unspoiled by tourism and captures the crustiness of Paul
Newman as the unhappy Garret's father--a man who takes
pride in cutting back to "no more than two beers a day" and
who is eager to get his son to rejoin the human race.  A
contrived conflict sees Garret at war with his former brother-
in-law and his wife's mother, both of whom blame the poor
guy for "allowing" their Catherine to die and who insist that
Garret return the paintings which were executed by the young
woman.  But the movie, which shows the seasoned beauty of
Ms. Penn as well as any other she has done is mired in
overdone exchanges of the lovers and between father and
son; a sham contention among neighbors; and a vapid
resolution devised to prevent these two essentially
incompatible souls from establishing a more permanent
footing.

_Message_in_a_Bottle_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
I am a sucker for a shamelessly romantic confection, and the swoony
trailer for Luis Mandoki's adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's bestseller
_Message_in_a_Bottle_ promised the tear-stained goods.  A woman finds the
titular item and is so touched by the letter that she seeks out the letter
writer--and finds him.  Along the way, we hear such wonderfully saccharine
lines as, "Don't you think it's brave--to love like that in this world?",
"Choose between yesterday and tomorrow," and, most memorably, "You were my
true north."
But as _Message_ dashed headlong into its tear-wringing final frames, the
audience at the screening I attended was noticeably dry-eyed and -nosed,
with very few audible sniffles.  And it's understandable why, for I
certainly was not one of those few.  I don't mind a formulaic film if the
film goes about the formula in an interesting way, or the story is strong
enough to sweep me away, formula be damned.  _Message_ does neither.  It is
a rather conventional and conventionally told tale where a lonely woman
(here, Chicago newspaper researcher/divorced single mom Theresa Osborne,
played by Robin Wright Penn) finds a kindred spirit in another lonely soul
(North Carolina widower Garret Blake, played by Kevin Costner, the author
of the message), but his devotion to a lost love (dead wife Catherine)
keeps him from committing.
There is nothing wrong with that story in and of itself, and Costner and
the radiant Wright Penn are a natural screen pair.  But director Luis
Mandoki and scripter Gerald DiPego wrap it in _too_much_ formula.  Theresa
and Garret fall for each other, but there's a Big Secret that threatens the
future of their relationship, the revelation of which naturally comes at
the pinnacle of their happiness (read: after they first make love).  (The
Big Secret in question, of course, is that Theresa found Garret's bottle
and sought him out.)  But even way before the story gets to that point,
there are other irksome cliches, in particular Theresa getting an early
wrong impression Garret after spying him in a brawl with his former
brother-in-law.  Speaking of in-laws, too much time is spent on a pointless
subplot involving Garret's strained relationship with them.  As if that
weren't damaging enough as it is, the thread is resolved in an overblown,
wordless, melodramatically-scored scene that borders on the laughable.
Perhaps the most disappointing thing about _Message_in_a_Bottle_ is that
it really could have turned out to be something.  The story has a proven
hook, and the casting is dead-on.  Wright Penn is captivating and likable;
Costner's typical stiffness is compensated by his rapport with his female
lead; and they are well-supported by Illeana Douglas (as Theresa's best
friend/co-worker), Robbie Coltrane (as Theresa's boss), and, in a
scene-stealing turn, Paul Newman (as Garret's father).  But these
individual elements are just that, elements, floating in a  large, overly
familiar sea.

When Message in a Bottle opens, a single mom enjoys a jog on the beach
after sending her son off to spend time with the ex.  As she runs, she
notices a bottle jutting out of the compacted sand, looks around as if
she were on Candid Camera, and finally pulls it free.  Yup; just like
the song, there is a message inside.
The woman is Theresa Osbourne (Robin Wright Penn), a researcher for the
Chicago Tribune, and the letter moves her and her equally lovelorn
co-workers to tears.  It is, apparently, a letter written by a man that
had recently lost his wife and had written the message as some type of
bizarre sea catharsis.  And you know how chicks eat that stuff up.
Not able to put the memory of the message or the effect of its romantic
drivel out of her head, Theresa decides to track down the mystery man.
Now, mind you, she only knows a few things about him  he is a horrible
typist and he loves to use awful boat metaphors in his work.  The
newspaper then writes a brief human interest piece on the enigma of a
message in a bottle and, after receiving tons of responses, Theresa
winds up getting copies of two other letters similar in form and
content.
Together with the crack research staff of the Tribune (which resembles
something more like an expert FBI forensics team), Theresa tracks down
the author of her letters via a tiny stationery store in St. Claire,
North Carolina.  It seems that after all of these years, the store
employee still had the name and address of the guy who bought the
letterhead and had no qualms about giving it out.  His name is Garret
Blake (Kevin Costner), a boat-fixer-upper guy in St. Claire.  Theresa is
on the next flight to North Carolina.
Her first glimpse of Garret is down on the water as he works on
restoring a beautiful schooner.  As luck would have it, he is an
attractive man with big, strong, blue-collar hands, his only physical
defect being thinning hair (in real life, he would have been a Morley
Safer lookalike).  She feigns interest in the vessel and he invites her
to take a little sail with him.  Despite the fact that she was raised in
a land-locked state, Theresa never gets seasick during the one-hour
cruise.
The two spend the next three days together and end up falling in love
more quickly (and almost more unbelievably) than Leslie Nielsen and
Priscilla Presley in The Naked Gun.  Theresa discovers that Garret's
artist wife died after pregnancy complications.  Not quite over his
monumental loss, Garret hasn't quite had the heart to disturb any of his
late wife's belongings  their house is somewhat of a living shrine to
her memory.  Of course, none of this hinders Garret from trying to get
into Theresa's pants lickety-split.  At one point, he awkwardly asks `Do
you like meat?'  What a smooth talker!
Things progress predictably until the final reel, when things take a bit
of an unexpected twist and all but the numbest apathetic will have their
waterworks turned to full blast.  Penn and Costner have little
chemistry, but are individually inoffensive  she has great hair and he
has tight jeans (this may be a special clause in all of his contracts).
Acting-wise, Paul Newman is the only standout as Garret's crusty old
father.  He is much more effective as a weathered drunk than last year's
staggeringly hokey gumshoe in Twilight.
The filmmakers are no strangers to the tear-jerking medium  director
Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman) and writer Gerald DiPego
(Phenomenon) etch a moderately light version of The English Patient,
with Oscar winner Gabriel Yared providing the score.  Based on a novel
by Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook), Message is warmly lensed by Caleb
Deschanel (Fly Away Home).  As a film it's mediocre, but as a chick
flick it's better than most.

give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, iluvmick@hotmail.com
        Studio executives have one eye stuck on their profit summary
and the other eye stuck on their calendar. With no small measure
of coincidence, they release certain pictures at the time of
holidays or observances. "Fathers' Day" was released around--get
this!--Fathers' Day, "Independence Day" debutted on the July 4th
weekend, and Christmas flicks come out in December. Therefore, it
was fitting that "Message In A Bottle" swept into theatres on the
Valentines' Day weekend. A romantic love story, this picture is
for lovers to attend and hold hands and cry together and whatnot.
        BUT, don't call this a date movie--at least, a FIRST date
movie. It's not really '99s version of "Sleepless In Seattle" or
even "You've Got Mail". This piece of work is painful to watch. I
wouldn't want to go to see this film on a first date (or even a
second) with a woman I don't know that well. The funny moments
are few and far between and they've set some kind of record for
tears shed in one movie. However, don't take that for negative
criticism--this is an old-fashioned, well acted love story
co-starring one of the all-time greats, Paul Newman. And good ol'
Paul would be worth watching in a tooth-pulling contest.
        While Newman is not the main focus of this movie, the two
leads, Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, certainly are. The
actors must have found some sort of emotional bond when they were
shooting this because while the script is mostly formulaic, their
genuine feelings for each other look real. Call it good acting,
but once the script calls for them to become smitten, they
actually look like they're in love. This relationship is not
hokey or off-putting. Luis Mandoki doesn't go for cheap laughs or
unrealistic sentiment to draw his audience into the movie. So,
it's difficult to stay detached from these attractive characters
for long. 
        The plot revolves around the proverbial message in a bottle.
Divorced mother Theresa Osborne (Wright Penn) takes a short
vacation on the New England coast. While jogging on the beach,
she finds a bottle on the shore. She reads the enclosed letter
and through her research job at the Chicago Tribune proceeds to
track down the author of the note. Her editor (Robbie Coltrane)
publishes the letter, which brings about hundreds of letters of
input from readers. Theresa is already infatuated with whomever
has written the heartbreaking letter and falls for him even more
when, through her persistence (and with assistance from
co-workers), finds that he has written other beautifully sad
letters to his lost beloved. She discovers that the man lives in
the Carolinas. Throwing good sense to the wind, she flies down to
meet this man.
        Garret Blake (Costner) is the lonely boat-builder who lost
his wife, Catherine, two years before. He has not dealt with the
intense pain of her death and neither has her family. He feuds
with them, particularly her brother, Johnny (John Savage), about
who should keep her paintings and other precious things. Also,
Garret lives with Dodge (Newman), his formerly alcoholic, yet
caring, father. Theresa meets Garret and they begin a
relationship almost immediately. Perhaps all this happens a
little quickly, but the movie is only two hours long, after all!
They fall in love, but he hasn't gotten over the loss of his
wife. That's the premise of "Message In A Bottle". To give away
much more would be to give away TOO much.
        While not a monumental romantic movie, this picture was
nicely shot (with a tastefully done bedroom scene) and the actors
are easy on the eyes. Wright Penn is beautiful and believable,
Costner is deliberately aloof (yet likable anyway), and the
legendary Newman is fine as the imperfect father. Costner and
Newman make a great father-son team and they actually look alike.
Wright Penn and Costner are well-cast (with that great chemistry)
and they both show their emotions well.
        This film pulls no punches. It has few surprises. This is
about dealing with intense pain and grief, letting go and moving
on. While it's formulaic and the romance blossoms a little too
perfectly, the acting is just right. Costner usually gets slammed
for his self-indulgence and vanity, but he doesn't even appear
until the 20-minute mark in this movie. Plus, this picture
doesn't revolve around just him, anyway. It's wonderful to see
the magnetic Robin Wright Penn (who picks projects carefully) and
especially delightful to see Newman. As a three-part package,
they're as honest as the movie they're in. So, bring along a
couple boxes of tissues and watch '99s first good love story.
Just be careful who you bring along. First dates beware, but
lovers enjoy.
USELESS TRIVIA--Unrewarded? If (and it's a big if) Paul Newman
receives an Oscar nomination for this supporting role, it would
be only his 2nd nomination of the 90s and only his 5th in 20
years!

Robin Wright Penn recently denounced the script for her new movie, "Message in
a Bottle," as being too "in-your-face and precious."  She's right-the script is
a manipulative hanky-puller painted by the numbers, but it is redeemed by
guileless performances and an ending that departs from the simplistic themes
that, up to then, it seems to pursue.
The plot's a sentimental romance with syrupy overtones:  On vacation, Theresa
Osborne (Penn) finds a bottle on a beach.  Inside is a type-written note from
"G." to a departed love, Catherine.  The note testifies to the sensitivity and
depth of feeling of "G.," and Theresa, divorced and lonely, begins a quest to
find the note's author.  Her boss (Robbie Coltrane), a "Chicago Tribune"
columnist, publishes the letter, and two other letters are revealed.
The clues in the letters lead Theresa to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and
boat-restorer Garret Blake (Kevin Costner).  His wife Catherine died two years
earlier, and Garret has lived in limbo ever since.  Theresa, of course, lies to
Garret about why she's there (setting the stage for the inevitable
"girl-loses-boy" development when he finds out  the truth), but they soothe
each other's wounds of lost love.  Romance blooms.
Both Theresa and Garret abandoned their dreams when they lost their spouses. 
She dreamed of being a writer; he intended to build his own boats. 
Predictably, each inspires the other to begin writing/building again.  Up to
the end, the message in this bottle seems clear:  move on after loss, learn to
live and love again.  I won't divulge the ending, of course, but it undercuts
the predictable themes developed up to then.  It led me to rethink my
assumptions about the movie and its subject matter.
This is the sort of movie that has to sell itself to the audience.  I was
willing to buy into it because the performances were open and honest.  Both
Penn and Costner seem quite earnest and genuine in their roles, which is a
surprising turn for Costner, who usually alternates between his "Eliot Ness"
and "Crash Davis" personas.  Paul Newman, who plays Garret's dad, Dodge Blake,
is a national treasure.  He's never given a bad performance or put forth less
than a full effort.  Even in a small supporting role, Newman shines.  By the
time it was over, I found myself caring most about Dodge, a cranky recovering
alcoholic who dotes on his son.
The familiar plot of "Message in a Bottle" shatters easily with slightest
application of cynicism or even realism, but its cast puts forth an admirable
effort to defuse those reactions.

Warner Brothers; rated PG-13 (mild violence, sexual situations); 132 minutes
Screenplay: Gerald Di Pego (from the novel by Nicholas Sparks)
Cast: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright-Penn, Paul Newman, Illeana Douglas, Robbie
Coltrane, Jesse James, John Savage.
I'm not an overly cynical guy.  There have been many glossy Hollywood romances
that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years.  However, I
have my limits and I also have standards.  This brings us to the subject at
hand: Message In a Bottle, the big ticket romance that Warner Brothers'
unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for Valentine's Day.
The story, what little of it that there is, involves boring Chicago Tribune
reporter Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright-Penn) dealing with her recent divorce
and trying to raise her young son Jason (Jesse James).  During a brief stay
somewhere in New England she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a
morning run by the ocean.  The letter, written to a mystery woman named
Catherine, instantly captivates her. Upon her return, Theresa shares it with
her best friend Lina (Illeana Douglas), her boss Charlie (Robbie Coltrane),
and the entire city of Chicago (the newspaper publishes an article about it).
It turns out that the message was written by grieving widower Garret Blake
(Kevin Costner) and so Theresa travels to North Carolina and tracks him down.
He turns out to have a colorful father (Paul Newman) but is otherwise
perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing.  This is somehow attractive
to Theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship.  Of course she doesn't
tell him that she found his letter, she wants to but the rules of this type of
film require him to find out later (preferably right after they first make
love).  This way Garret can get very angry and the relationship can be
threatened.
The discovery of the message and Garret's discovery that Theresa discovered
the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the
nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film.  There's a truly lame
subplot about Garret's relationship with his dead wife's family (he gets into
a bar fight with her brother, played by John Savage) and then the necessary
tear-jerking ending.  A fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly
who will die, although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel.  The actual
death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced, and unintentionally
humorous, sequences filmed since... well, since Costner's The Postman (1997).
Message In a Bottle is one slow moving film.  Last year audiences were offered
endurance tests such as The Horse Whisperer and Meet Joe Black but both of
those films resemble Jerry Bruckheimer productions next to this.  They also
had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out
technical work.
Message In a Bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material
all the way, and losing badly.  Costner and, especially, Wright-Penn are both
likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too
boring.  They also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry.
The supporting players are given very little to do.  The reliable Douglas is
particularly wasted.  Old pro Newman gives his all and occasionally threatens
to kick some life into this dead horse of a film.  A confrontational scene he
has with Costner near the end is especially well played.  However, too
frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are.
The film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works
to undercut the story.  Gabriel Yared, who previously set the romantic moods
of The English Patient (1996) and City of Angels (1998) with his scores,
overdoes it a bit here.  Caleb Deschanel's camera makes everything look a
little too beautiful.  Do the offices of the Chicago Tribune really need to
look heavenly?  The editing by Steven Weisberg is troubling not only
considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at
times.
The real offender here is screenwriter Gerald Di Pego.  Working from a best-
selling novel by Nicholas Sparks (which I have not read but have been told is
on the same literary level as The Bridges of Madison County), Di Pego creates
one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times.  Its strict adherence to
clichés brings to mind such disasters as I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
(1998).  There simply isn't an original scene in this film.  The dialogue is
rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively
long pauses every character takes while speaking.
This is director Mandoki's first film since When a Man Loves a Woman (1994),
the solid Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia romance.  He's simply going through the motions
with this.
Message In a Bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings
available in theaters at the moment and vies with What Dreams May Come (1998)
as one of the most misguided romances of the decade.

In some respects it can count for a lot -- the classic example is Jim
Carrey, otherwise known as the Twenty Million Dollar Man -- and in other
respects it can count for very little. AT FIRST SIGHT, a recent romantic
release, dropped off the Top Ten charts only three weeks after debuting
despite trumpeting the names of Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Eventually,
that may be the case for the latest drama from WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
director Luis Mandoki, but it's clear initially that MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
is drawing a tidy sum from its leading names. 
Those leading names are Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul
Newman, and each has something to offer this romantic tale of love under
precarious circumstances. Costner has it all backwards, making something
out of nothing and nothing out of something, but by this point in his
career he's mastered the art and we've come to expect it from him. Robin
Wright Penn, of FORREST GUMP notoriety, even manages to make Costner's
frequent missteps look charming, and together the two create quite a
screen presence. Newman lends comic relief in fine form, giving a much
more memorable performance than his last outing in the crime drama
TWILIGHT. 
Here, Costner plays sea dog and widower Garret Blake, a sailboat expert
who lost his wife several years ago and now writes bottled romantic
epistles to her. Jogging along the beach one day while on vacation,
divorced newspaper researcher Theresa Osborne finds one of these
messages and takes it back to Chicago to check it out. Using
professional connections and doing some tidy sleuth work on her own, she
tracks the messages back to Garret and smoothly works her way into a
love affair with the man. The two share a common feeling of neglect, and
share their love by throwing marshmallows at each other before snuggling
up by a fire on the beach. All of this is very romantic, except for the
fact that Theresa's secret of how she found Garret threatens to tip the
balance. 
The movie plays out like THE HORSE WHISPERER Lite, with all of the grand
cinematography of Big Sky country replaced by cramped silhouettes of
sailboats on the Carolina coast at dusk. Gone is the silent brooding of
the Robert Redford film, and instead we get Robin Wright Penn and Kevin
Costner doing voice-overs that lack all emotion but will still manage
evince a tear in every woman's eye. The red-blooded American males in
the audience will appreciate the movie's lone fight scene, in which a
disgruntled Costner suplexes his opponent on a diner table before being
told by the assembled crowd, "It's not worth it, Garret." 
Truth be told, the movie does manage to play itself out fairly
efficiently, and its 145-minute running time hardly seems that long. The
drama is solid, providing metaphors for Garret's maturity with his
personal project of constructing a sailboat. When the sequences begin to
scrape the bottom, Paul Newman enters with a witty line and a twinkle in
his eye. There's not a specific flaw to be found, other than the movie's
refusal to break from tradition and its seamless devotion to the
predictable. The ending does not come as a surprise, and encapsulates
the whole affair with startling precision. On the whole, this isn't a
light and breezy romantic comedy but a moody drama which will have those
leaving the theater feeling disenfranchised. But it just might be worth
it, anyway.

 Most days I would love to be in the shoes of people in Hollywood.  Much as
participating in the play is every secret playwright's dream, and painting
the picture is every secret photographer's dream, being in THE BIZ is the
secret dream of every movie critic I know.  We apply to film school.  We try
to make movies.  Some of us even write them, such as Roger Ebert, author of
the movie Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.
 But, one person to another, I wouldn't be in Robin Wright Penn's shoes if
you paid me a million dollars.
 Robin Wright Penn, you see, is married to Sean Penn, who snubs the
Hollywood mainstream, and, if there are two words beyond "It Sucked" that
describe Message In a Bottle, "achingly mainstream" would have to be my
choice.  Predictable to a T, bitingly sweet, it just wasn't a movie I could
connect with.  It is not the chick flick in the aspect that it is chic to go
to, as She's all That would be, but instead the chick flick, as in the
perfect example of a reason not to make movies like that.
 Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the screenplay comes off as an
uninspired, unintelligent event.  The attempts that it makes to insert
professionalism and lyricism into the script come off as downright stupid as
the attempts often made in techno-thrillers to take on serious subjects,
such as medical ethics (should the doctor play God?) or religion itself.
 The basic plot of the terribly contrived story is that Teresa (Robin Wright
Penn) discovers a message in a bottle while jogging in Virginia,
consequently, she publishes this in the Chicago Sun Times and begins her
search for the writer, a woman on a mission and in love (has Hollywood ever
stopped insulting you, ladies?).  What she finds is Kevin Costner.
 Robin Wright Penn, formerly Jenny of Forrest Gump fame, does a nose-dive on
the bad-roles-for-good-people tree and hits every branch on the way down,
coming off as a stupid main character that can be connected to only by
people of similar intelligence.  Kevin Costner, straight off of The Postman,
disappoints yet again, and proves that in Hollywood, sex appeal sells.  His
character, at least to me, came off as a Homo-repressed idiot.
 Paul Newman, the only good part of last summer's Twilight, disappoints yet
again as the father of Kevin Costner in the movie I love to hate.
 Now, I'm sure a lot of people liked this tale because it filled the
likeable criterion: sweet, moderately funny, character-driven with a
storyline so formula that it could have very well been a movie done without
a script.  But, as for me, and any other movie buff, you will dread this
film.  This is a symptom of the greater disease of the terribly cliche films
that Hollywood turns out.
 What else to bash?  Oh, yeah, the direction.  The direction consists of
shots stolen from
different movies: sex during a thunderstorm, a boat being launched, grainy
film met to represent the past, a complete absence of sound during emotional
pseudo-tension, and let's not forget the lightning flashing as Kevin Costner
discovers the secret of Robin Wright Penn.
 Personally, I think it's time to send a message to Hollywood.  Don't just
stop making mainstream trash, but stop making films that rub off as
insulting to women because they portray them as drooling idiots.  And worse
for the Y-chromosome, don't make any that portray all men as Kevin Costners,
make them jerks, and still have the main character fall in love with them.
 I plead you, producers, hack writers, directors, help me out.  Make a smart
character for a change, please.

No, it's not exactly like "Sleepless in Seattle." In fact, the only part
that's similar is the first 20 minutes when Theresa finds the message in a
bottle, it gets printed in the news and the public responds. By the way, the
letter from Costner riddled in cliché (though, this might well be
realistic -- he's a boatman, not a poet) wasn't very intriguing. So, if you
happen to be reading this review on your way to the showing, relax ...
arrive late. The first 20 minute chunk is the weakest part of the film.
While I'm at it, I could have missed the last 20 as well.
Now the middle, that's pretty good. It's a delicate, fragile, gently paced
love story that moves along with a subtle energy created by the abrasion of
hesitation against anticipation. (Whew, get through that sentence?) In
short, it's simply sweet to watch these mid-life folks experiencing that
"first love" kind of awkwardness.
Kevin Costner and Paul Newman are ultimately believable as father and son.
They seem so natural as family, I have to wonder if they really are. Kevin
performs splendidly as a co-star in a movie that really isn't about his
character (for a change). Though I have to say, the film was rather lifeless
until he appeared on the screen, and then it seemed, all the other actors
were revitalized.
"I'm going to go back to the big city and you're going to forget about
me..."

Is it possible for someone to love too much?  Is being overly romantic a
severe character flaw?  Those are a few questions posed by Message in a
Bottle, an adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' romantic novel.  It is
schlocky and disposable at times, but makes for a decent romantic
diversion.
Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn) is a research assistant for a
prominent columnist at a Chicago paper.  One day, while on vacation, she
discovers something interesting: (you guessed it) a message in a
bottle.  This particular message is a hopelessly romantic love letter
from a man to his dead wife.
Theresa becomes obsessed with the letter, and convinces her boss at the
paper to let her track down the author.  It's not revealing too much to
say that in a rather short amount of time, she does.  The man is one
Garret Blake (Kevin Costner), a North Carolina man who restores boats
for a living.
So, Theresa hops a jet and finds herself in North Carolina, looking for
this man of passion, and falling hopelessly in love (even before setting
eyes upon him). But Garret still pines for his dead wife, and is unsure
if there is room in his heart for another love.
Nearly everything in this film seems distant and adrift.  This
disconectedness works all right for the beginning.  But, even after
Theresa and Garret meet, and romance begins to bloom, there is never a
sense of immediacy to the couple or their relationship.
Kevin Costner's laconic style is on full display here.  It seems to fit
a man pining for his lost love, but isn't as suited for a man finding a
new love. Robin Wright Penn is strangely subdued while playing what is,
when you think about it, a stalker.  There is some chemistry between the
pair, but the whole thing never gets hotter than a slow burn.
The one thing that does bring a jolt of life to the film is Paul Newman,
playing Garret's cantankerous father, Dodge.  He's given all the film's
best lines, and even when they're not given to him, he takes them anyway
and makes each scene in which he appears his.  The fire and skill with
which he crafts his character puts all the other actors in this film to
shame (even though they're not doing that shabby of a job).
The entire plot of Message in a Bottle is clearly telegraphed several
scenes ahead. Even when the film takes a sharp left turn into melodrama,
it doesn't catch you completely by surprise.
On the whole, what Message in a Bottle needs is a little energy.  Just
as Paul Newman enlivened what could have been a stock, throwaway
character with a spark of vitality, so too could the whole film used an
extra burst of life.

        Robin Wright Penn seems to be pining for Helen of Troy's job
recently.  In "Forrest Gump" she played Jenny, the drug addict that
Forrest names his shrimp boat after.  In her newest film, "Message in
a Bottle," she is the inspiration that prompts a man who thought he'd
never know love again to rediscover his passions for both the ocean
and boat building.  With these two roles, Wright Penn becomes the face
who launched... well, two cinematic ships.
        She also gives a performance that's one of the few genuine
pleasures in the movie, which never really seems sure of its bearings.
It missteps badly and frequently, giving us one interesting set-up
after another then cheerfully relegating them to the background any
time the film threatens to get too interesting.  I can picture the
screenwriter sitting at his desk, ticking off items from his mental
checklist as he worked on the final draft: Have I included a fist-
fight?  Check.  A sex scene?  Got it.  The mandatory conflict, in
which one of our protagonists rejects the other's affections for
no particular reason?  Yep.  A death whose only purpose is to
generate involuntary weeping from the audience?  Most definitely!
        Theresa Osbourne (Wright Penn) is a journalist for the Chicago
Tribune, a hard worker, but longing for love in the wake of an
unpleasant divorce.  While vacationing at the beach, she comes across
a glass bottle partially buried in the sand.  Inside is a love letter
so elegantly written that she burns afire with questions about the
unknown author.  "Dear Catherine," the note begins; as Theresa
continues
to read, she learns of a heartbroken lover who has lost his wife and
can find no purpose in his existence without her.  Theresa is haunted
by the writer's story, and upon her return to Chicago she shares the
letter with her co-workers at the Tribune.
        Charlie (Robbie Coltrane), the editor of the paper, decides to
run the letter as a human-interest story ("This is bigger than the
low-fat muffin scandal!").  Much to everyone's surprise, the Tribune
is soon flooded with reports of other letters seemingly written by the
same author.  Theresa puts the pieces together and eventually
identifies
the heartsick writer as Garret Blake (Kevin Costner), a widower who
resides in North Carolina's Outer Banks.  Deciding she has to meet
this
poetic man, Theresa pays him a visit.  No points for guessing that a
romantic relationship blossoms between them.
        And that, in a nutshell, is the biggest problem with "Message
in a Bottle"; there are no points for guessing *anything*.  This is
strictly formula filmmaking, never deviating from the tried-and-true
methods which have graced romance movies for decades.  Why, for
example, does Theresa not reveal to Garret that she knows about the
letters he wrote to Catherine?  Because otherwise there could be no
scene in which Garret discovers the truth for himself.  We'd miss out
on the requisite teary argument in which Garret tells Theresa how hurt
he feels over being deceived, and we wouldn't get to see him walk out
on her, a crisis that's necessary so the couple can get back together
in the final act.  You all know the drill.
        A bit of advice for the filmmakers: if you are fortunate
enough
to have Paul Newman in your movie, don't waste him.  Newman plays
Dodge Blake, Garret's cantankerous father, who projects a personality
of grit and nails but has a wise heart underneath.  Newman is in fine
form here, imbuing his character with humorous mannerisms and the
fortune-cookie wisdom that all cinematic dads instinctively possess.
He's far more interesting than Garret (a subplot involving Dodge's
possible alcoholism is never developed as fully as it deserves to be),
and that's part of the trouble: Dodge is such a joy to watch that the
movie plods when he's not on the screen.
        The film has a moment about fifteen minutes from the finale
which would be a perfect place to end this tale; it seemed like such
an obvious stopping point that I actually reached for my coat.  But
no,
the story has an unnecessary quarter-hour tacked on after it, which
only serves to capsize the preceding 120 minutes and render them
completely invalid.  It's one of the worst endings I have ever seen,
because it serves no purpose other than to provide a cheap (and
emotionally manipulative) effect.  "Patch Adams" fans will love it.
        "Message in a Bottle" is all over the map.  The film makes
much of the fact that both of the characters are searching for someone
to be their emotional compass; their "true north," so to speak.
Unfortunately, the movie needs its own sense of direction.  As it
stands, we have a classic case of the blind leading the bland.

Is this bottle half full or half empty?
Shutting down after a personal tragedy is not an uncommon occurrence. Our
lives are on automatic. We sleepwalk through the day with emotions flatlined.
Some people work through grief and eventually move on. Others cling to the
catastrophe and continue the rest of their days with only memories. Their
present is the past: a comfortable but lonely place to live.
Garret Blake (Kevin Costner) has mourned the death of his wife Catherine for
two years and can't get beyond his guilt of not being the perfect husband.
He's given up on his dreams and writes messages to Catherine, rolled up in
bottles and tossed into the sea.
On a run along the beach, recently divorced Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright
Penn) finds one of his bottles. The words are so poetic and heart-felt that
she has to find the author.
As you might expect, when she does locate him in North Carolina's Outer Banks,
she is instantly captivated and his feelings begin to awaken. (In real life
the odds of it being Kevin Costner are just about as great as an anonymous
emailer turning out to be Meg Ryan.)
The film is infuriatingly uneven. The injured souls' romance is believable and
touching. Their hesitancy in getting involved is poignant. But just when the
story grabs you, it shifts gears.
Theresa's boss and co-workers at the "Chicago Tribune" are dull yet eat up
screen time. Garret's fight with his former in-laws doesn't contribute much.
It feels like padding for an already overly-long film.
One of the biggest sins is a far-too-common plot device. When Theresa first
encounters the man of her dreams, she doesn't tell him the true story of why
they meet. After they become involved, it's too late. She's waiting for the
right moment to confess and, of course, it never comes.
The audience knows that he's going to find out, get angry and leave her. 
Unfortunately the film takes its sweet time getting there and most of the
intervening scenes are lost as viewers anticipate the inevitable.
This film is designed to appeal primarily to women. The bitter-sweet romance
is a tear-jerker with a red sun shimmering in the background against an orange
sunset, sailing ships on the high seas and lovers under a starry sky as
strings swell on the soundtrack. They spend their first few nights in bed just
holding each other. I have it on good authority that women like this kind of stuff.
Oddly enough for one of my particular gender, I usually enjoy "women's films."
However this one has an inexcusable flaw. The ending, out of left field, is
cinematic manipulation at its worst. The filmmakers take a convenient easy way
out just to pull at the heartstrings.
Costner is one of my guilty pleasures, but his character here mostly just
mopes. Penn is difficult to get a grasp on. She plays a strong enticingly
beautiful woman but her habit of leaving sentences unfinished and filling in
with giggles is less than endearing.
Paul Newman as Dodge, Garret's crusty dad, is a treat. The old codger could be
Hank Stamper, his role years ago in "Sometimes A Great Notion", slightly more
mellow and relocated to another coast. Newman and Costner work well as father
and son. Sometimes you'll wish that the movie were about _their_ relationship.

Nicholas Sparks' novel "Message in a Bottle" is a gossamer-thin story
of a columnist who finds the item of the title on a beach, reads the
enclosed letter, and then sets out to find the man who wrote it.
When she finally tracks him down, there's an instant mutual
attraction; sure, it's a sterling example of the literature one of my
college friends called "the 'I turned around and I was in love'
books," but on its own terms it's a perfectly passable daydream.
Director Luis Mandoki's adaptation of the best-seller maintains the
same mellowness,almost to a fault. Next to this, the films of "The
Horse Whisperer" and "The English Patient" could almost be mistaken
for entries in the "Die Hard" series. If the novel is best washed down
with a pitcher of herbal iced tea, this unquestionably beautiful movie
might make some in the audience wish for a triple espresso.
The screenplay has changed the setting of the drama, the occupations
of both the leads - Garret (Kevin Costner) no longer runs a scuba
school and Theresa (Robin Wright Penn) now has some kind of research
job that somehow allows her plenty of expense money and time off to
zoom around the country - and thrown in are some backwoodsy former
in-laws to make trouble for Garret. Why bother? Theoriginal material
would have worked just fine onscreen.
"Bottle" wants so very badly to be a world-class tearjerker and
there's no denying it has a whole lot of things going for it.
Costner's performance is relaxed and charming, much closer to the guy
everybody liked in "Tin Cup" and "Field of Dreams" rather than the
self-congratulatory figure of "The Postman." He and Penn - who seems
to have carefully studied Meg Ryan's moves from "Sleepless In Seattle"
- blend comfortably together, a major plus in any romantic drama.
The film's trump card turns out to be Paul Newman as Garret's salty
dad.  He and Costner have several wonderful small scenes together, and
Newman's work radiates with world-class starpower; it takes a lifetime
of training to turn a simple "go away" into a major laugh line.
The photography by Caleb Deschanel is also astonishingly pretty,
although that's not such a shock when you remember Deschanel was the
director of "Wind," a movie that was little more than two hours of
sailing ships and sea spray.
So why does "Bottle" feel half-empty instead of half-full? Part of the
trouble lies in Mandoki's approach to the story's ending, which worked
fine in the novel but seems corny in the extreme onscreen. Also, The
movie's pace is so leisurely - this being a Costner film you can bet
there are numerous lingering close-ups of Kev - attention tends to ebb
and flow like the tides Garret and Theresa ride.
There's a lot to enjoy in "Message in a Bottle," to be sure, and it
might be just the ticket for those in the mood for anything remotely
romantic. But like a festive basket of chocolate-covered potato chips,
it's the sort of thing that certain people will definitely appreciate
more than most.

Written by: Gerald Di Pego, adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel
Starring: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman
Synopsis:
Teresa (Robin Wright Penn) is a gorgeous, sexy, blond journalist who
works in an office chock full of ultra slim, lonely Ally McBeal types
all pining for a perfect man. One day Teresa finds an anonymous soulful,
poetic letter in a bottle along the seashore. Her boss publishes it in
the Chicago Tribune.
As a news project Teresa tracks the letter to its author Garret (Kevin
Costner), who is not your average sweaty shantytown dock worker. Aside
from being in dire need of a woman's nurturance to tend his emotional
heartache, Garret builds his own ships and sails them, writes poetry,
looks gorgeous in a yachting sweater, admires fine wine and romantic
bonfires, loves children, and has a close relationship with a charming
father who looks like Paul Newman.
Since soulful, hunky, eligible bachelors are hard to come by, Teresa
makes herself available to Garret so they can pursue a romantic
relationship. Teresa and Garret cuddle and couple and romance each other
for a long time while the audience waits for the inevitable moment when
Garret must stomach the unpleasant revelation that he was originally a
news story and research task. Will love prevail for the power couple?
Opinion:
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE is a date flick whose protagonists have been around
the marriage carousel once or twice. The bad news is that the movie is
predictable, too long, and has an unsatisfying conclusion. The good news
is that MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE offers ladies two screen hunks for the price
of one. Newman steals the show with his one-liners as the charming
father. And Costner is at his "aw shucks" cutest when he says little,
plays tender, and wears hunky clothing. MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE is two hours
of picturesque, seaside cinematography and satisfying if predictable
romance - - tailor-made for ladies who are fans of Newman and Costner.
But the ending is disappointing.

I've never seen a more blistering hatred of a PROVEN movie star, Academy
award winning motion picture director/producer and fine actor than I
have of Kevin Costner.  Before 'Message in a Bottle' was released, some
showed their unprofessional bias by saying things like: "This film has
Kevin Costner in it, and therefore it will be bad".  Many have attacked
Costner unfairly and have been dedicated to ruining his career since he
went against the establishment with director Oliver Stone in making
1991's 'JFK'.  That was probably Costner's last truly great film and
while 'The Bodyguard' and 'Tin Cup' were successful hits for Costner,
they were forgettable movies and can't compare to his 'Bull Durham',
'Field of Dreams' and 'Dances With Wolves' days.
'Message in a Bottle' works for one very big reason: it's tasteful.  In
an adult romantic drama, there is little or no noticeable swearing, no
villains and a bedroom love scene that is the most tasteful I've seen in
years.  You can take anyone to see it from your girlfriend/boyfriend to
your mother or grandmother.  These factors alone don't make for a good
film but in addition to these qualities, 'Message in a Bottle' creates
characters that you care about.  I felt by the end of the picture, that
it was a bit too talky and perhaps that made for a disappointing overall
presentation, but it's one of those films that you have to watch until
the very end before you realize what an absorbing and lightly flowing
film it really is.
Robin Wright Penn plays a Chicago journalist named Theresa Osborne who
finds, literally, a message in a bottle on the beach one day and the
writing is a two page love letter to a woman named Catherine and through
good investigative journalism tactics, Theresa tracks the origins of the
note to a man living in North Carolina named Garret Blake (Kevin
Costner).  Catherine was Garret's wife.  Now deceased, we learn that
Garret wrote the letter and threw it into the ocean, intending for no
one to find it, let alone read it.  Theresa and Garret start a romance
that leads farther than either one of them anticipated and Theresa's
motivation for seeking out Garret and telling him the truth of why she's
with him becomes more and more difficult for her after she falls in love
with him.  Garret refinishes boats and builds them from scratch for a
living and lives with his likable but sad sack father Dodge (Paul
Newman).  Dodge knows he's capable of being the definition of what is
called an 'old fart' but he avoids this knowing that he needs his son as
much as his son needs him.  Both men are widowers and equally feel the
loss of a daughter in law and a mother as much as they do the women they
were closest to in life.
One of the disappointments in the film is that many notable and talented
actors are once again wasted to a certain degree.  There is Garret's
former brother in law (John Savage), who, along with the rest of his
family, blames Garret for his sister's death.  Back at the Chicago
newspaper, Theresa's colleagues in print are Robbie Coltrane and Illeana
Douglas who never really develop into anything more than caricatures.  I
suppose, in fairness, there really isn't much you can do with these
characters without taking away the impact of the main character's
destinies.
There is a description of Costner's character made by Newman in the
film.  In regards to losing his wife, the father says of his son to
Penn:  "It's like he's been hit by a truck and is only half alive".
Costner plays his role very well and his character reminded me a lot of
William Hurt's character from 1988's 'The Accidental Tourist' when
Hurt's character lost his son in a violent crime.
'Message in a Bottle' is written by Gerald DiPego based on the novel of
the same name by Nicholas Sparks and is directed by Luis Mandoki.  Luis
Mandoki takes a very simplified but powerful form of direction in hand
to make this film and while the film is somewhat predictable in it's
last half hour, it still is a good film using input from a talented cast
(I would argue led by Newman) and a story that will require plenty of
handkerchiefs that theatres should be required to pass out as you leave
the theatre.

After dropping her son off with her ex-husband, Theresa Osborne (Robin 
Wright Penn) elects to spend a few days on the Cape before returning to 
the Windy City.  While jogging on the beach, she discovers a bottle 
half-buried in the sand.  Inside, there's a love letter.  "Dear 
Catherine..." the note begins.  It's signed "G."
Theresa is so immediately struck by the poetry, the passion, and the 
honesty of the writing that she's determined to locate its author.  
Charlie, her editor at the "Chicago Tribune" (a well-cast Robbie 
Coltrane), sees this as a great human interest story and prints the 
letter without Theresa's input.  The article produces a bonanza of 
reader feedback: two more letters materialize, both written on the same, 
handcrafted paper and using the same old-fashioned typewriter.  Since 
Theresa works in the research department, it isn't long before she's 
tracked the creator of these beautifully heartfelt passages to the 
little town of St. Claire on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
Cute idea for a movie, especially one called "Message in a Bottle."  
Actually, it's a cute idea for a book, since the film is based on 
Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name.  Apparently the book is more 
moving than the film: "I didn't cry during this but when I read the book 
I couldn't hold back the tears," an older gentleman commented during the 
end credits.  Hmm...
Once Theresa shows up in St. Claire, starts poking around, and 
discovers that "G." is, in fact, Kevin Costner... well.  Things take a 
turn for the worse.
That's not exactly fair.  Costner, as Garret Blake, a boat restorer 
with a dead wife and adversarial in-laws, is no worse here than he was 
in, say, "The Bodyguard."  But he does tend to play two--and only 
two--distinct roles.  The significant, allegorical, God-like-figure 
role--The Mariner, The Postman, Lt. John Dunbar, Robin Hood.  Or the 
goofy, irreverent, sexy hunk who wears his baseball cap backwards and 
believes in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days 
role.
"Message in a Bottle" bids Costner a return to his more romantic roots, 
but since he's in mourning throughout most of the picture, he slips into 
portraying The Carpenter.
Robin Wright Penn is attractive and earnest herself, so the two get on 
well enough, but most of what they say and do is the stuff of clichéd 
cinema, which makes the second half of the film less interesting than 
the first.
It's not that Theresa and Garret don't have any chemistry; they're easy 
and likable and kind of chummy together.  But the film doesn't take any 
risks.  It's an unapologetic tearjerker right down to its manipulative 
climax.  And, of course, there's the big scene in the rain following 
Garret's painful realization of why Theresa came to St. Claire in the 
first place.  Why do films insist on pelting our heroes with tens of 
gallons of water during key moments such as this?  And why did I keep 
looking to see if Garret had little flaps of skin behind his ears?
Fortunately, "Message in a Bottle" has Paul Newman onboard to smack 
Theresa and Garret around a bit.  As Garret's father Dodge, Newman 
steals the film with his sarcastic put-downs and, frankly, superior 
acting talents.  Hats off to the film's producers for having the 
foresight to sign the gracefully-aging veteran.  Without him, "Message 
in a Bottle" would be lost at sea.

I've always believed that what makes any experience most fulfilling
and gratifying is our willingness to let down our defenses, allowing
ourselves to risk humility and heartache for the sake of discovery. 
Especially with matters of the heart, I suspect that when you put too
many parameters in place, love could sadly become more of an exercise
rather than an experience.  And herein lies what I thought to be the
major drawback of `Message in a Bottle,' a film that seemed more like
two people falling in therapy rather than in love.
One of the people is Theresa (Robin Wright Penn).  Her job is fairly
dry as she writes reports and conducts research for her big city
newspaper.  This career and her recent divorce seem to have sapped her
sense of passion.  But while walking along the beach one day, she
discovers a bottle containing a letter.  It is written so eloquently
and romantically that it would be fodder for any Oprah show.  Theresa
is immediately overwhelmed by its tone and tenderness and begins an
exhaustive search for the author of this message.  Before too long,
she hops on a plane to meet the writer whose words have affected her
so much.  It seems like such a crazy thing to do, but romance has a
funny way of affecting one's head.  Her destination is now a small
fishing town on the Carolina coast, and the mysterious man that she'll
try to find is named Garrett (Kevin Costner).  
Garret is a lonely person who has recently lost his wife.  He's quiet,
somewhat withdrawn, and possesses an appealing boy-next-door kind of
charm.  Yet once they meet, something strange begins to happen (or not
happen).  Amazingly, very little chemistry develops between Theresa
and Garret.  The main reason is the way in which Penn's character is
written.  Theresa is constantly weighing facts and outlining action
steps.  Is that what love is about?  `I wasn't sure where the
boundaries were,' she states in one scene, or `where do we go from
here,' she asks in another.  Consequently, as both Theresa and Garret
explore their feeling for one another, it seems as if the couple is
going through a counseling session rather than laying the foundation
for something wonderfully fulfilling.  Additionally, as we learn more
about Theresa and Garret, our involvement with these two characters
becomes lopsided.  Finally, I was practically caught off-guard (as if
a huge wave crashed into me) when the film reached its ending, which
seemed to literally come out of nowhere.  Yet the overall performances
were all very nice.  Penn displays a good range of emotions as she
looks for that unattainable love, which she might have found.  Costner
achieves a nice balance of possibly loving again tempered by his guilt
in doing so.  And Paul Newman as Garret's fiery,
girl-advice-dispensing dad steals all of the scenes that he's in.  I
really liked the performances, but was waterlogged by the lack of
direction and pep that the film seemed to be capable of given it's
cutely orchestrated first 20 minutes.  Whatever the filmmakers had
intended for us, the message wasn't so clear.

  If you're an incurable romantic, this is the love story you've 
been waiting for. If you're a cynic, this one's not for you. Based on Nicholas Sparks' book, adapted by Gerald DiPego, lushly photographed by Caleb Deschanel, and directed by Luis Mandoki, the plot revolves around two lonely people. Robin Wright Penn plays a divorced single mom who works as 
a researcher for the Chicago Tribune. While on vacation alone in Cape Cod, she finds a bottle containing a beautiful, poetic love letter from a man to a woman named Catherine. The signature is simply "G" but she tracks 
down the sender. He's Garret Blake - a.k.a. Kevin Costner - a sailboat builder who lives on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Since the death of 
his wife Catherine, he has led a sad, solitary existence - until Penn appears, literally, on his doorstep. Inexplicably, she doesn't tell him she's found his missive in a bottle. She's scared of being honest, afraid to 
trust. So she pretends she's just a tourist interested in sailing, and they begin a gentle, tender romance, complete with moonlit marshmallow fights, while the audience waits for the inevitable confrontation scene in which he discovers the truth and turns on her. Handsome, smiling Paul Newman, as Dodge, Costner's sassy, caustic, irascible father, deftly steals the picture, in one scene muttering, "If I was about 150 years younger, you'd be in trouble, young lady." Indeed, he has far more charm than Costner , who balefully underplays an underwritten role. Is it cliche-ridden, maudlin and manipulative? Without question, particularly the conclusion. Will you cry? Undoubtedly. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Message in a Bottle" is a sweet, hearts 'n' flowers 6. Spun-sugar mind-candy for Valentine's Day.

Forget the three-hour supposed mess that was THE POSTMAN. Forget the fact
that he left his wife of 16 years to cuddle up to some supermodels. Forget
the fact that he once called a Madonna show live in concert "neat". Kevin
Costner is back in top romantic form, in his Dockers and comfortable shirts,
soft-spoken nature, and everything else the Valentine-less women might be
seeking over this lover's weekend.
PLOT:
Man loses a wife. Man writes her letters in a bottle and tosses them into
the ocean to ease his pain. Another woman finds the messages and sets out to
find the man behind the beautifully honest words. Once found, the two share
each other's pains and experiences, and find some solace, and more, in each
other's company.
CRITIQUE:
An ironic adult story of love and mourning. This movie is a bit slow, has
some nice romance, bordering on sappiness, some solid acting performances,
and a hokey ending. For all those who go to see this film expecting to find
a wonderfully romantic time at the movies, well, you might be quite
disappointed. This movie does have some tender moments, along with some
romantic touches, but over and above it all, it caters to a story line
drenched in the incapacity of a man to move on with his life, after his
loved one has passed away. This film might even be a success in the hearts
and minds of all those people whose lives have suddenly halted after the
loss of someone dear to their hearts. Don't get me wrong, there is an
obvious love story that brews up between the two leads here, it's just that
I didn't expect the grieving undertones of the film to be as accentuated as
they are.
The actors are all very good with Costner pulling off another vulnerable,
nice, tough and rumble everyguy with his eyes closed and his hands tied
behind his back. Wright Penn is also decent in her role, but nothing to
write into a bottled letter and drop into the ocean. Newman on the other
hand seemed stereotyped from what I had seen of him in the previews, but
actually zings it up as the gruffy ol' dad, reminiscent of his wonderful
performance in NOBODY'S FOOL (8/10). Mood-wise, the whole "feel" of the
movie is very comfy and authentic, especially during the wooing sequences
over the first half of the movie. If you're a sea lover, you might love this
film even more, since the water does seem to permeate these peoples' lives
quite deeply. Overall, the cinematography is nice, the actors are all very
good, but I found the whole piece to be a little too slow and uneventful for
my taste. It seemed to be much more of a cathartic picture rather than
romantic, but all in all, not an awful movie. And yes, Mrs. JoBlo and I did
catch it on Valentine's Day!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kevin Costner auditioned three times for the role that eventually went to
Nicolas Cage in the wonderfully, outrageous RAISING ARIZONA (8/10). His role
in THE BODYGUARD was originally written for Steve McQueen. He played the
dead body in THE BIG CHILL. He stands 6'1".
Robin Wright Penn backed out of the role of Maid Marian in ROBIN HOOD:
PRINCE OF THIEVES, starring Kevin Costner, after getting preggers with Sean
Penn's kid. She played the role of Jenny in 1994's award-winning FORREST
GUMP (7.5/10) opposite Tom Hanks. Her first acting gig on TV's "Santa
Barbara" soap opera garnered her three Emmy nominations.
Actor John Savage, whose real name is John Youngs, may be best remembered
for his portrayal of the character Steven in 1978's classic THE DEER HUNTER
(7.5/10). He also spent 6 years, from 1988 to 1994, in South Africa, working
with Nelson Mandela for the anti-Apartheid movement.
In respect to actor Paul Newman, by the time the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences honored him with its Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in
1994, he had raised over $80 million in support of various charities through
his many philanthropic activities (and his own food product line called
"Paul Newman's Own"). He is an avowed lifelong beer lover. He has six kids
and has been married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958. His only son
Scott Newman died of a drug overdose in 1978.
Actress Illeana Douglas dated famed director Martin Scorsese for a few years
during the 90s.

     Twenty-five years ago, Paul Newman would have played Garret Blake,
the grieving, laconic hero of Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel MESSAGE
IN A BOTTLE.  He would have brought the ideal combination of elements to
the role of a shipbuilder whose sea-borne messages to his dead wife are
found by Chicago newspaper researcher Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn),
compelling her to seek out the author of the sensitive missives.  You can
imagine Newman both as a man's man -- a loner dedicated to his craft --
and a ladies' man -- deeply sensitive when touched by the love of a good
woman.  That's the kind of screen presence you need when you're dealing
with one of these mythically appealing romances like THE BRIDGES OF
MADISON COUNTY or THE HORSE WHISPERER.  You need a Clint Eastwood, or a
Robert Redford...or a Paul Newman.
     In 1998, you get Paul Newman playing Garret's father Dodge, and as
Garret you get...Kevin Costner.  Costner has always been at his best in
roles where her could be easygoing (SILVERADO, BULL DURHAM, TIN CUP), 
while his attempts at playing icons (THE UNTOUCHABLES, WATERWORLD, THE
POSTMAN) could be most charitably described as uneven.  Yet here he is in
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, playing the emotionally unavailable but romantically
irresistable Garret.  He's the kind of guy who loves too deeply, whose
gestures of self-sacrifice are the stuff of song and story.  It's Costner
once again as the paradigm, the icon, and I for one didn't believe him for
a second.
     To be fair, Costner isn't the only thing wrong with MESSAGE IN A
BOTTLE.  Director Luis Mandoki's adaptation is a technically glorious
piece of work -- beautifully photographed by Caleb Deschanel, sweepingly
scored by Gabriel Yared -- but it's one heck of a long sit, clocking in at
a soggy two hours and fifteen minutes.  The storyline parallels Theresa's
emergence from emotional isolation after a difficult divorce with Garret's
difficulties letting go of his wife, and does so in fetishistic detail.
There's a subplot involving Garret's conflict with his embittered in-laws,
and the occasional tete-a-tete between Dodge and Garret or between Dodge
and Theresa, all building with a gruelling lack of tension to one big
cathartic payoff.  You may leave the theater with your hanky wet, but it
could be from the drool that collects while you nod off to sleep just as
easily as from tears.
     Lost at sea along the way are extremely effective performances by
Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.  Wright Penn is an actress we don't see
very much, which allows her still to be an actress in a role like this
rather than a movie star.  Her conflicted pursuit of Garret -- a man whose
letters should have told her from the start isn't ready to love anyone
else -- is convincing in context; her moments of insecurity and
disappointment are genuinely affecting.  Newman, meanwhile, gets to be
gruff in a way that usually turns actors into hams, but turns this veteran
into a breath of fresh air.  He's so effortlessly charming, it's easy to
forget the Harlequin sensibility at the heart of MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and
begin enjoying it as human relationship drama.
     Costner, too, can be effortlessly charming, but not here.  His
interpretation of the role is so focused on Garret's internalized mourning
that in the moments when he's supposed to be letting go with Theresa, he
looks like a man trying to act like a grieving man trying to be
effortlessly charming.  If that reads awkwardly, it plays even more
awkwardly, with Costner straining for Meaning and Significance in every
scene while his leading lady acts circles around him.  MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
undoubtedly will have its sob appeal, just as the novel did.  Unlike the
film adaptations of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY and THE HORSE WHISPERER,
that's the main thing this one has going for it.  It's too bad it couldn't
have been made twenty-five years ago, when Paul Newman hadn't yet handed
over the iconic roles to actors ill-suited to handling them.

So what's on your ideal movie checklist?  Let's take a look at director Luis
Mandoki's MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and see how it stacks up.
Beautiful people?  Check.  With Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul
Newman, you've got them in spades.
Gorgeous images?  Thanks to Caleb Deschanel's dazzling cinematography of
glistening ocean waters and warm interior sets, you can put a big checkmark
there.
Believable romantic chemistry?  Another check.  Costner and Penn are
wonderful together and just as awkward as lovers in real life would be.
Now this is where the scoring gets tricky.  How does your personal ranking
system handle intelligent stars stuck in a heavily clichéd drama?  In this
case the whole audience knows what several of the key turning points have to
be, and they're right.
And how many credits do you deduct when a completely ridiculous and
implausible ending comes totally out of left field for the sole purpose of
mass audience manipulation.  Do you feel violated as a viewer?
In a movie that is as inviting and charming as it is annoying and
infuriating, how to evaluate it is a tough call.  Sometimes you're
captivated, and other times you're exasperated.  Will the good outweigh the
bad for you?  Maybe one of those personality tests would help.  If you are
in the hopelessly romantic category, you'll probably like the film's soap
opera predictability and emotional shenanigans.  On the other hand, if you'
re more analytic, well  You get the idea.
The plot revolves around two people with huge voids in their hearts.  As
unassuming newspaper researcher Teresa Osborne, Robin Wright Penn plays
against her usual tough-as-nails type.  Teresa is a divorced single mom, who
was happily married and planning a second kid when one day she saw her
husband with another woman.  Teresa is a beautifully shy sort who bursts
into girlish giggles when she feels unsure of herself.
As Garret Blake, a repairer of broken ships, Kevin Costner plays a man whose
heart bears what he thinks is the irreparable damage of a lost wife.  The
ever-melancholy Costner is well chosen as a man who sees himself as
hopelessly cast adrift in a sea of sadness.  When presented with a glimmer
of happiness, he spends time watching his shoes rather than the person in
front of him.
The setup for their meeting is a bottle containing a beautiful love letter
that Garret wrote some time ago to his wife.  In its confessional passages,
he tries to atone for his sins of omission.  He wasn't the husband he wished
he had been.  When Teresa accidentally discovers the poetic message, she
launches into a quest to locate its author.
Teresa finds Garret early in the story but doesn't tell him about the
message.  The audience waits for the inevitable confrontation scene in which
he discovers the truth and turns on her.  Until this clichéd scene, they
have a romance that's heavy on cuddling.  A gentle and tender lover, Garret
is fond of softly stroking Teresa's neck.
As Garret's father, Dodge, Paul Newman turns in a confident and sassy
performance.  Dodge is strictly a two-beer dad, who is full of carefully
delivered advice for his son.  For one, Dodge claims that his son's coffee
is so terrible he shouldn't foist it off on any potential girlfriends.
Dodge worries that Garret will let Teresa slip through his fingers.  `If I
was about a hundred and fifty years younger, you'd be in trouble young
 lady,' a handsome, smiling Dodge tells Teresa.
After a long romance that is quite sweet but meanders frequently, the movie
comes to its maudlin conclusion.  The result is a mixed bag of a movie 
just right for some viewers but perhaps too clichéd for others.
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE runs too long at 2:12.  The movie is rated for PG-13 for
sexuality and a little profanity and would be fine for kids 11 and up.

 Message in a Bottle (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Kevin Costner, Robin
Wright Penn, Paul Newman and John Savage.
 Theresa Osborne is a woman with a hole in her life. She is divorced and
devotes her time between her job as a researcher at the Chicago Tribune and
caring for her son, Jason.
 But underneath this seemingly dependable, confident woman is an
unfulfilled soul yearning for that special someone to help her reconnect.
 Sounds like a romance novel, doesn't it?
 Well, Message in a Bottle is a glossy love story, a star-studded date
movie that's not as soapy as it sounds.
 Strong performances, crisp directing and first-rate photography have
meshed to create a compelling story, based on Nicholas Sparks' best-selling
novel, that while a bit long at two hours and 15 minutes, maintains your
involvement with the protagonists.
 While jogging on the beach, Theresa finds a bottle containing a letter.
Her soul reaches out to its author for his words are filled with pain and
regret. The writer has lost his wife, his "true north" and his letter deals
with his sorrow.
 Theresa's boss publishes the letter, which leads to the discovery of a
second and a third. Theresa makes it her mission to find the writer. Her
sleuthing leads her to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and to sailboat
builder Garret Blake (Kevin Costner).
 She convinces the paper to send her to North Carolina, where she contrives
to meet Garret.
 Of course, a romance blooms. But Garret is still grieving for his lost
Catherine. He finds it difficult to extinguish the past, even as his salty
old dad, Dodge (Paul Newman), pushes him to get on with his life.
 The two best aspects of Message in a Bottle are Newman's performance and
the cinematography of the legendary Caleb Deschanel.
 Newman's Dodge is an alcoholic who has given up the bottle. He limits
himself to two beers a day. Newman adds heft and complexity to Dodge that
surprasses what could have been a one-dimensional, cliched character.
 The sequence is which he confronts Garret, who has brushed him off,
telling him that what Garret does is none of his concern, is one of the
strongest in the film. Newman shows the pain a child's errant word can
cause.
 Deschanel, whose credits include The Right Stuff, The Natural, The Black
Stallion and Fly Away Home, is a master of bringing whatever environment he
is filming into the audience's lap.
 In Message in a Bottle, you feel the spray of the ocean, the power of the
waves, as the wind captures the sails of Garret's boat.
 As Garret, Costner is not afraid to show his character's vulnerability. In
such films as Dancing With Wolves, JFK and even the dreadful Waterworld and
The Postman, Costner has created larger-than-life characters. It is a
relief to see him playing a regular guy with flaws and doubts.
 The only quibble about his performance is that - on land - he seems too
slow, too deliberate, as if he is allowing his grief to envelop him and
debilitate his natural rhythm. At sea, Costner seems to allow his Garret to
be freer, more spontaneous.
 As Theresa, Robin Wright Penn is radiant and intelligent. She tries to
hide her insecurities behind a carefree nonchalance about what is lacking
in her life.
This is an intimate story and director Luis Mandoki, best known for White
Palace and When a Man Loves a Woman, intersperses the love story with many
closeups, especially of Wright Penn's eyes.
 Mandoki also is adept at using silence to forward the story, especially in
a scene in which Costner's Garret and his feuding brother-in-law, Johnny
(John Savage, in a small, but effective, role), resolve their differences.
 Gerald DiPego's script is not perfect. Theresa's co-workers, for example,
come across as types, cliches, rather than full-blown characters. This is
too bad, since Theresa's best friend is portrayed by the titanic-talented
Illeana Douglas. Wasting that great actress's gifts is a high crime.
 Overall, though, Message in a Bottle is an entertaining outing. Your date
may enter the theater with reluctance, but he may exit with a tear in his
eye.

1999 - 126 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for profanity, mild violence, and sexual situations).
Reviewed February 13, 1999.
Director Luis Mandoki's last film was the superb, serious 1994 drama 
"When a Man Loves a Woman," but his luck has ultimately run out with his 
latest picture, "Message in a Bottle," which is the worst type of 
romance, a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the 
heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather 
than tear them up. Everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in 
advance since this same type of story has been done many times 
before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense, and the 
film ultimately moves at such a very, very deliberate pace, as if it is 
trying to make great, "meaningful" statements and plot developments, 
that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through. 
"Message in a Bottle" begins with Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn), a 
single mother and researcher at the Chicago Tribune, whom finds a bottle 
washed up on shore as she is jogging one day. Inside the bottle is an 
anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named Catherine, and 
Theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it 
around at her work and, to her objection, finds that her editor has 
placed the letter in the newspaper. Soon, a heavy research is conducted 
to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship 
logo on the top of the typed message, and after it is traced to a man 
named Garrett Blake, Theresa finds herself traveling to the Outer Banks, 
a boating town in North Carolina, to find out the specifics of the 
message. Of course, Garrett turns out to be a handsome, rugged man 
around Theresa's age and played by Kevin Costner. She is immediately 
charmed by him, but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there, 
and finds that Catherine was Garrett's late wife who died a few years 
earlier. Do you think you know where this is headed? Most likely you do, 
and I wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's 
end, the movie has fallen into deep, artificial melodrama that I didn't 
buy for a second.
If there are any positive things to say about "Message in a Bottle," it 
is that the performances by Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman, as 
Garrett's stubborn, but loving father, are far above par to be in such a 
wasteful, "Shaggy Dog" love story, and that the cinematography by Caleb 
Deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast, and 
paints Chicago as an equally alluring city. Meanwhile, Costner has yet 
to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has 
made recently. It seems that with such bad luck, he wouldn't want to 
make another movie set near water, but here he is again with one of the 
main, and most ridiculous, centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea. The 
other actors are all, sadly, wasted, including Illeana Douglas, an 
underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "friend" roles, 
here playing Penn's confidante and co-worker at the Tribune.
The first half of "Message in a Bottle" plays like a hum-drum, trite 
television movie for the Lifetime channel, as Theresa spends a great 
deal of time "getting to know" Garrett, with dialogue that is not the 
least bit stimulating or entertaining. Usually, I am the type of person 
to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is 
no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships, but 
here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt 
"written," and not as if people were really "talking." When the main 
characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other, 
and are not particularly interesting themselves, you know immediately 
that you are in trouble. 
I swear that while watching "Message in a Bottle," I felt as if I had 
just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater 
(heck, in actuality I'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on, 
by Nicholas Sparks). Always one step ahead of the characters, the movie 
ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true 
Hollywood melodrama, the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger 
of tearing. Nobody wins prizes for guessing that Garrett will eventually 
find out Theresa's secret, and that several obstacles will come within 
their ways of living happily ever after. This same exact problem 
occurred in last year's very, very similar (watch this, and you will 
realize just how similar I mean) Meg Ryan-Nicolas Cage romantic drama, 
"City of Angels."
Although Theresa is deeply touched by the "heartfelt" letter that she 
finds in the bottle, perhaps the filmakers might have been better off 
finding a message in a bottle of their own, preferably before filming 
began. It should have read, "Memo to screenwriters: Use you brain!"

Nicholas Sparks' novel "Message in a Bottle" is a gossamer-thin story
of a columnist who finds the item of the title on a beach, reads the
enclosed letter, and then sets out to find the man who wrote it.
When she finally tracks him down, there's an instant mutual
attraction; sure, it's a sterling example of the literature one of my
college friends called "the 'I turned around and I was in love'
books," but on its own terms it's a perfectly passable daydream.
Director Luis Mandoki's adaptation of the best-seller maintains the
same mellowness,almost to a fault. Next to this, the films of "The
Horse Whisperer" and "The English Patient" could almost be mistaken
for entries in the "Die Hard" series. If the novel is best washed down
with a pitcher of herbal iced tea, this unquestionably beautiful movie
might make some in the audience wish for a triple espresso.
The screenplay has changed the setting of the drama, the occupations
of both the leads - Garret (Kevin Costner) no longer runs a scuba
school and Theresa (Robin Wright Penn) now has some kind of research
job that somehow allows her plenty of expense money and time off to
zoom around the country - and thrown in are some backwoodsy former
in-laws to make trouble for Garret. Why bother? Theoriginal material
would have worked just fine onscreen.
"Bottle" wants so very badly to be a world-class tearjerker and
there's no denying it has a whole lot of things going for it.
Costner's performance is relaxed and charming, much closer to the guy
everybody liked in "Tin Cup" and "Field of Dreams" rather than the
self-congratulatory figure of "The Postman." He and Penn - who seems
to have carefully studied Meg Ryan's moves from "Sleepless In Seattle"
- blend comfortably together, a major plus in any romantic drama.
The film's trump card turns out to be Paul Newman as Garret's salty
dad.  He and Costner have several wonderful small scenes together, and
Newman's work radiates with world-class starpower; it takes a lifetime
of training to turn a simple "go away" into a major laugh line.
The photography by Caleb Deschanel is also astonishingly pretty,
although that's not such a shock when you remember Deschanel was the
director of "Wind," a movie that was little more than two hours of
sailing ships and sea spray.
So why does "Bottle" feel half-empty instead of half-full? Part of the
trouble lies in Mandoki's approach to the story's ending, which worked
fine in the novel but seems corny in the extreme onscreen. Also, The
movie's pace is so leisurely - this being a Costner film you can bet
there are numerous lingering close-ups of Kev - attention tends to ebb

There's a lot to enjoy in "Message in a Bottle," to be sure, and it
might be just the ticket for those in the mood for anything remotely
romantic. But like a festive basket of chocolate-covered potato chips,
it's the sort of thing that certain people will definitely appreciate
more than most.
