TRANCERS (USA, 1982)
Director: Charles Band
Screenwriters: Danny Bilson, Paul de Meo
Cast: Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, Michael Stefani, Art La Fleur
     This film is probably familiar to those of you who have righteous cable
service, but to those of us who don't, it's a mystery.  It was made before
BLADERUNNER or THE TERMINATOR, but it has elements of both.  Set in the
future, we have tough cop John Death (Tim Thomerson) tracking down Trancers,
mutants who can make "weak-minded" people turn white, froth at the mouth, and
obey their every whim (rather like some TV evangelists I know of).  The leader
has headed back into the past, to kill the ancestors of the Los Angeles 
council, thus causing their future offspring never to exist.  Death is sent
back to the past to stop the plot, and gets messed up in the kind of senseless
violence you'd expect in this kind of film, at time having to out-run bullets,
elsewhere almost being tanned to death.
     Good maniacal fun, lots of neat parts, and a very clean plot that
makes sense and is clever to boot.  It's a good idea to remember that it
precedes those other two SF movies, since so many of the elements are similar.
A grade of C, B if you're at a midnight movie to see it.
