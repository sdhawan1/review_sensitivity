Having to grow up with great paternal expectations hanging over your
shoulder sure dampens ones creativity and self-initiative. I'm sure
anyone who has lived the experience, will acknowledge that they were
once little boys with impossible-to-please-fathers, who were once little
boys with impossible-to-please-fathers. So the merry-go-round keeps
going round until somewhere along the way, the chain breaks. The idea of
parenting is to guide, not take over your kid's life.
LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is best remembered as the popular 60's family series
that was full of morals and lessons learnt in childhood. It hits the
screens once again, this time the big screen. Beaver your average nice,
but non-too bright kid is trying to get a new bike of mum and dad. At
the same time he wants to make dad proud of him, by playing football and
wanting to be a doctor. Gosh, is that really what parents want for their
kids nowadays? Things come to a head when the bike gets stolen and
Beaver wants to drop out of the footy team Â– a mid-childhood crisis.
Having goals and expectations for your children is not necessarily a bad
thing, if it lies in your child's best interests. However, there is a
tendency for some parents to selfishly live out their own private
agendas through their children. Parents are always looking for an excuse
to be proud of their child. Some will go over the top and murder their
daughter's rival for cheer group leading, but on the whole most parents
are down to earth enough to just brag about their kid's grades, sporting
achievements etc to relatives, friends or anyone with a ready ear.
So after scoring a goal, finding his bike and ending up inside a giant
coffee mug, Beaver finally gets his dad to accept him for who he is and
not for what he would like him to be. A more a less important message
for over achieving parents. Janine Turner (NORTHERN EXPOSURE) is an
unusual choice for Mrs Cleaver. She vacuums in pearls, her hair is
permed and dyed blonde, and she carries a perpetual smile on her face.
Somehow, beneath this veneer of maternal perfection, one can see her
silently screaming to be released from her apron string bondage. Mr
Beaver (Christopher McDonald) seems grumpier than in the 60's series,
whilst Wally Cleaver (Eric von Detten) seems an overall nicer older
brother.
LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is not amongst the best children films released these
holidays, but at least it has something important to say about
parenting.

     Why?  That's the question foremost in my mind when I consider this 
latest motion picture retread of a defunct television series.  Why was 
this movie made in the first place?  If it had to be made, why didn't it 
take the BRADY BUNCH MOVIE's satirical approach? And why didn't the film 
makers consider that there might be someone in the audience over the age 
of 10?  Most importantly, why did I bother seeing this film in the first 
place?
     Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of the 
television series LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, nor have I ever been.  I have seen 
no more than a handful of episodes, and was neither impressed nor 
enchanted.  This new motion picture, which attempts to modernize the 
Cleavers by placing them in the 1990s, affected me in the same way.  
It's not really a terrible movie, but, unless you're a little kid or a 
BEAVER aficionado, you're likely to find this film a little too dumb to 
be tolerable.
     Perhaps the powers that be should have taken a lesson from how THE 
BRADY BUNCH made their small-to-big screen transformation.  Turning this 
into a straightforward satire might have gone a long way towards 
reducing the level of tediousness in LEAVE IT TO BEAVER.  Alas, with the 
exception of an occasional sly aside, this film plays it mostly 
straight.  The one advantage of this approach is that the movie 
illustrates just how embarrassingly bad the original sit-com is by 
today's entertainment standards, especially with all the nostalgia 
stripped away.
     The story plays like a very looooooong episode of the TV series 
(updated to the '90s, of course -- now June can say "crap").  8-year old 
Beaver Cleaver (Cameron Finley) has his brand new bicycle stolen by a 
local hoodlum while big brother Wally (Erik von Detten), who is supposed 
to be watching out for him, is busy making goo-goo eyes at a girl.  Dad 
(Christopher McDonald) yells at both of them, then softens up when his 
wife, June (Janine Turner), makes him realize that he's being too 
domineering.  Meanwhile, the neighborhood conniver, Eddie Haskell (Adam 
Zolotin), is mad at Wally for stealing "his girl," and enjoys seeing his 
rival lose her to a roughneck who happens to be friends with the bike 
thief.
     Ho hum.  To be fair, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER has its moments, the best 
of which is an off-the-wall family therapy session during which Wally 
lets out some unexpected truths.  Considering how good this scene is, I 
can't determine why first-time feature director Andy Cadiff didn't opt 
for the same irreverent tone throughout.  Likewise, some of the modern 
characteristics of the Cleaver parents hold a promise that isn't 
developed.  June shows a few sexpot tendencies and there are times when 
Ward appears close to grabbing the nearest sharp object and slicing his 
family to pieces.  Unfortunately, rather than being accentuated, these 
aspects are underplayed, causing me to wonder if there might have been 
some more openly campy elements in an earlier version of the script.
     The acting is hodgepodge of mediocre performances, with only 
Christopher McDonald doing anything interesting with his character (he 
opts for playing Ward tongue-in-cheek as often as he can).  Janine 
Turner, best known for her recurring role as Maggie in NORTHERN 
EXPOSURE, is as stiff as a board.  Teen actors Erik von Detten and Adam 
Zolotin are largely unconvincing.  And young Cameron Finley, who plays 
the title character, gets high marks for cuteness, but isn't a 
particularly strong actor.  LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is light on cameos, with 
brief appearances by Barbara Billingsley (June) and Ken Osmond (Eddie) 
being the most notable.  The absence of several key original cast 
members, particularly Jerry Mathers (Beaver) and Tony Dow (Wally), is 
curious, to say the least.
     Fans of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER will undoubtedly enjoy this movie more 
than I did.  To me, however, this seems like a wasted opportunity to do 
something inventive -- perhaps to improve upon what was done with THE 
BRADY BUNCH.  About the best thing I can say about LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is 
that it's innocuous.  Some people find that to be a positive quality.  
Personally, it's about the last thing I look for in a movie.  And, while 
LEAVE IT TO BEAVER may not be one of the worst films of the year, I 
certainly won't be recommending it to anyone.  It's just another 
television series that is diminished by the transition to the big 
screen.

     In the production notes for LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, producer Robert
Simonds comments on why he chose director Andy Cadiff (TV's "Home
Improvement") for the project:  "Of all the shows on television, 'Home
Improvement' is tonally the 'Leave It to Beaver' of the '90s."  That
notion explains a lot about how the film incarnation of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER
ended up as it did.  If "Home Improvement" is our "Leave It to Beaver,"
that makes Tim Taylor our Ward Cleaver...only I don't remember Ward as a
well-intentioned but emotionally immature doofus.  The idea of a competent
father whose advice actually means something is about as hip as saddle
shoes and nickel malts.
     The central character of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER isn't really Theodore
"Beaver" Cleaver (newcomer Cameron Finley), or his older brother Wally
(Erik von Detten), and certainly not June (Janine Turner).  It's Ward
(Christopher McDonald), a decent guy and good provider who happens to have
a truckload of unresolved issues to hamper his parenting skills.  Today's
Ward Cleaver doesn't gently guide the incorrigible Beaver towards learning
from his mistakes.  He's too busy damaging the lad's self-esteem by
creating unrealistic expectations and appearing judgmental.
     And it's too bad, because there's a silly, innocent quality to LEAVE
IT TO BEAVER which makes it better than you'd expect from yet another TV
retread.  The comedy comes from the kind of predictably broad slapstick
common in most contemporary comedies for kids, but it's blessedly free
of toilet gags and exaggerated mayhem.  Brian Levant and Lon Diamond's
script (Levant worked on the syndicated "The New Leave It to Beaver"
series in the 80s) is often surprisingly clever, and even more
surprisingly clean.  The performances are sit-com simple yet mostly
appealing, particularly that of the agreeably adorable Cameron Finley.
Even the problems faced by the Beaver and Wally are sit-com simple:
Beaver loses his bike and struggles with playing pee-wee football, while
Wally accidentally steals away the girl admired by his best friend Eddie
Haskell (Adam Zolotin).
     In the good old days, Ward and June would solve the boys' simple
problems with simple but wise words of encouragement.  In 1997, solving
the Beaver's problems requires a trip to a family therapist and plenty of
soul-searching on Ward's part; Beaver may be the one to mess up, but it's
Dad who needs to learn a lesson.  It's obvious that LEAVE IT TO BEAVER
isn't meant to court the nostalgia audience, unless it is through the
inclusion of Barbara Billingsley (the original June) and Ken Osmond (the
original Eddie Haskell) in cameos.  Those viewers might actually enjoy
seeing the Cleavers portrayed as a healthy and happy family, rather than
just another dysfunction waiting to happen.  This LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is
unabashedly 90s in a fairly depressing way:  it takes paternal
incompetence as a given.

     "You know Mrs. Cleaver," proclaims Eddie in his typically unctuous
voice.  "And I say this with all due respect.  I have to admit, you're
a babe."  This time the ever conniving Eddie Haskell has hit the nail
on the head.  LEAVE IT TO BEAVER's June Cleaver, as played with grace
and delicate wit by Janine Turner, is a knockout.  ("June you're
vacuuming in pearls again," her husband later almost pants.  "You know
what that does to me.")
     Next to the surprise that the remake of the 1950's TV series is
reasonably charming, the biggest surprise is that the parents --
Christopher McDonald plays a sincere Ward Cleaver -- steal the show.
Even the twelve-year-olds are interesting, but poor eight-year-old
Beaver Cleaver, played by the numbers by Cameron Finley, is stuck with
the least imaginative part of all.
     The setup for the plot is that Beaver, who has a history of
destroying his possessions, wants a bike.  Eddie tells Beaver to suck
up to Mr. Cleaver by pretending to want to join the football team.
Once the softened-up dad buys him the bicycle, he can quit the team.
Beaver's twelve-year-old brother Wally sees substantial risk in this
scam, arguing, "There is a reason why football players wear more
equipment than men who train attack dogs."
     Adam Zolotin's Eddie has the same flexible moral code of Ken
Osmond's original Eddie, but the new Eddie, with his slicked-back oily
hair is more of a pip-squeak.  (Osmond as well as the original June,
Barbara Billingsley, appear in brief cameo roles in the remake.  The
new June is much better, but don't be surprised if you pine for the
old, more nefarious Eddie.)  Erik von Detten's Wally is more laid back
than the original and more interested in the opposite sex.  Eddie's
would-be girlfriend, who actually is infatuated with Wally and detests
Eddie, is played sweetly by Erika Christensen.  When Wally spins the
bottle during that quintessential adolescent ritual of old, the result
is as touching as it is predictable.
     Although the script by Brian Levant and Lon Diamond has some of
the obligatory, campy scenes, for the bulk of the film the addition of
a laugh track would be impossible.  Unlike the series, which was
strictly comedy, the movie has a gentler and more serious tone.  June
comments on Ward's and all men's obsession with their relationship with
their own father, saying that they are more concerned with it than with
the relationship with their own children.  And when the Beaver is
forced to see a "shrink" and bring his family along with him, it is
Wally who turns morose and starts bawling.
     Randy Edelman's sweeping music has the drama of a much more
substantial endeavor.  Combined with Thomas Del Ruth's warm backlit
cinematography and Perry Andelin Blake's colorfully nostalgic sets, the
picture beckons us to enter and enjoy even if the story gets pretty
thin.  "Hamlet" it isn't.
     "If I grow up and have as dumb a kid as me," decides Beaver.
"It'd be hard not to want to belt him."  The film itself succeeds in
spite of, not because of, Beaver's laughable stupidity.  Director Andy
Cadiff has the good sense to focus on the rest of the family.
     LEAVE IT TO BEAVER runs just 1:28.  It is rated PG for a couple of
instances of bathroom humor.  The film would be fine for any age, and I
suspect that the baby-boomer parents may like it better than their
kids, who are the putative audience for the picture.  My son Jeffrey,
age 8, thought the film was "really good" and commented that it might
make his top 20 of the year list.  I recommend this small pleasure to
your family and give it ** 1/2.
