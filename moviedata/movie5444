'Sweet and Lowdown' is one of those films from a cinematic genius where you
don't need the credits to tell you who's directing it.  You could blindfold
someone throughout the opening credits and take the blindfold off and while
watching it, know that it's being directed by Woody Allen.  There is a bit
of a cheat to this theory as Allen himself appears in a visual narration
along with others to discuss the film's main character but you would still
know it's a Woody Allen film without it and they say a great director can
see a finished film in his head and Allen is one of those great directors.
Sean Penn, a remarkably under rated actor and former best actor Oscar
nominee for 'Dead Man Walking' in 1995, gives a grand performance from a
rather cliched (but yet entertaining) script by Allen.  Penn plays Emmet
Ray, a little known jazz guitarist during the 1930's who was rumoured to be
second best in the world and some actually thought he WAS #1.
He drinks, he can't handle money, he pimps, he womanizes and has all of
those typical flaws that is usually associated with genius in a Hollywood
film.  I have my doubts about this theory on the part of many film makers.
They say Mozart died of a serious illness such as pneumonia, a high fever or
the flu, yet 1984's 'Amadeus' chose to show that he died in much the same
manner as Elvis Presley, presumably heart failure brought on by being full
of drugs and from severe exhaustion.
Emmet's idol is Django Reinhardt, considered the best jazz guitarist in the
world by most and Emmet actually has dizzy spells, is capable of fainting
and/or becoming ill when he's in the presence of this man.  This is made
very clear early in the film and 'Sweet and Lowdown has a wonderful rhythm
to it that captures the period it is displaying just perfectly.  As we
progress into the first half hour or so, Emmet is making the rounds, playing
from club to club, generating controversy and trying to spice up his stage
act anyway he can.  He creates a quarter shaped moon as a prop in which he
will attach a seat and be lowered down on during the beginning of his act.
It's a disaster on its first try and is never used again.
Emmet meets Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute girl with a heart of gold.  She
does laundry for a living, wears baggy clothes and big shoes and is about as
"plain jane" as they come.  She is fond of Emmet and the two of them
consummate their relationship with each other early and this is in keeping
with Allen's liberal theme of relationships, something which is going to be
his legacy among film historians.  Emmet tires of Hattie and can't stay on
the wagon long enough to appreciate the genuine care she has for him and he
must explore the world he knows very little about.  He hooks up with Blanche
(Uma Thurman).  She likes fancy clothes, cigarette holders and the wild
side.  Right up Emmet's alley so to speak.  Too bad their relationship is
synthetic and unloving.  The really exciting part of the film comes when
Emmet suspects Blanche of infidelity and finds out that she is dating a hit
man (Anthony LaPaglia) and tags along one day to prove his theory by hiding
in the back seat of a car and becomes the unwitting individual involved in a
hold-up, police chase and auto accident.  This is a theory that is put
forward by one of the historians during the film and is humourous since
there are many stories told and shown as too EXACTLY what did happen.
Woody Allen has a knack for turning out about one film a year and can't be
accused of repetition as much as some would like to tease him about it.  As
far as period pieces go, Allen has another gem from the 1990's entitled
'Bullets Over Broadway' which is a cousin to 'Sweet and Lowdown' in its
depiction of a period piece.  It has a bit more of a neurotic flare that
Allen is also famous for putting in his films but 'Sweet and Lowdown' is
sort of a series of snapshots all put together in a very docile fashion and
entertains as smoothly as the music it is telling a story about.
As for the performances, I think Sean Penn could be Oscar bound for this
film from recognition he missed last year for 'Hurlyburly', a film I hated
but which was high on many critic's lists for Penn's performance.  I've
always like Penn, even back in the 1980's when he played such parts in
'Racing With the Moon', 'The Falcon and the Snowman' and 'Colors'.  Samantha
Morton is also great in a role of gestures and facial expressions, a much
more difficult part than one which is dialogue driven.  As a mute, she must
communicate differently and she does it in an almost psychic performance
where we can hear her thoughts and feel her emotions.  'Sweet and Lowdown'
is one of the high points of Woody Allen's career in the 90's, a decade in
which Allen refused to follow the Hollywood studio system and still clings
to his roots from two decades gone by.  What a guy!

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Woody Allen's (Celebrity) latest is a fictional account of a 1930s jazz
guitarist named Emmett Ray (Sean Penn, The Thin Red Line).  The film is
a sugary homage to the music of that period (a fave of Allen) and
features fantastic performances from an ensemble cast.
The film is shot to look like somewhat of a documentary (so it feels a
bit like Zelig).   Allen skillfully blends accounts of Ray's life with
interviews from a panel of jazz aficionados, including himself, Ben
Duncan, syndicated columnist and author of The Jazz Life Nat Hentoff,
and filmmaker Douglas McGrath (Emma), who also co-wrote Allen's Bullets
Over Broadway.  We learn from these experts that Ray is cocky, abrasive
and brutally honest almost to a fault.  In other words, he thinks he
hung the moon, referring to himself as the world's second greatest jazz
guitar player  second only to Django Rhinehart, whom Ray calls a French
gypsy.  He actually idolizes Rhinehart, passing out the only two times
he laid eyes on the six-string legend.
A gifted instrumentalist with a blistering playing style, Ray works the
white clubs of Chicago with a white band before heading to the other
side of the tracks and jamming with black musicians.  He hangs out with
hobos and loves to watch trains and shoot rats at the dump.  Ray is also
a pimp, a kleptomaniac and a drunk, which, together with his prickly
demeanor, leaves the prodigy in many a pickle both with his career and
love life.
Things change when Ray meets a mute girl named Hattie (Samantha Morton,
Dreaming of Joseph Lees) that he is set up with as part of a double date
with a fellow musician.  Ray immediately dislikes the sweet Hattie and
treats her like a leper, but still he brags about his significance,
constantly reminding her that he is the world's second-best guitar
player, or one of the five best 9-ball players, or one of the top six
poker players ever.  Whatever the situation is (save one), he's the
best.  He begins a relationship with Hattie, but eventually dumps her
for the more glamorous Blanche (Uma Thurman, The Avengers).
Penn is fantastic as Ray  a great role for a great actor  but even he
is overshadowed by Morton's  wonderful, wordless performance as the mute
Hattie.  Allen's regular production team is back here to create yet
another top-notch picture with a lovely score from Dick Hyman.  One
change to the mix is the addition of cinematographer Fei Zhao (Raise the
Red Lantern) who, despite not being able to speak English, was able to
glowingly lense the film.  With this comedic effort, Allen yet again
proves that he is one of the most creative writer/directors in the
world.
1:35 - PG-13 for adult language, sexual content and some alcohol and
substance abuse

SWEET AND LOWDOWN, written and directed by Woody Allen, tells the story
of Emmett Ray, the world's second greatest jazz guitarist.  This legend
in his time is played with boyish charm by Sean Penn.  Told in
talking-head documentary style by jazz historians, the movie paints a
vivid portrait of an artist who never really existed.
Emmett, who fainted the two times he ever witnessed his better play,
lives an itinerate lifestyle.  He may be well known among jazz
aficionados, but his propensity to show up for work drunk, late or not
at all causes much grief for the owners of the clubs that book him.  In
order to get by, he does a little pimping on the side.  He also steals,
but that's just because he's a kleptomaniac.
One day, the relationship-challenged Emmett meets an unlikely date on
the boardwalk, a laundry worker named Hattie (Samantha Morton).  A
homely, sad-sack of a woman, Hattie has no figure and no voice.  She had
lost the ability to speak due to an illness, and she can't even write
legibly to compensate for it.  Perhaps the only reason that Emmett is
attracted to this woman, whom he ridicules as a "dumb, half-witted
orphan," is that she likes sex as much as he.  More likely, it's because
she demands so little of him.  She goes on the road with him, acting in
the capacity of a wife, although they never marry.
Late in the story, Emmett is swept off his feet by a striking
ex-debutante and would-be writer, Blanche (Uma Thurman).  Blanche may
have the looks that Hattie doesn't, but she shows neither the love nor
the loyalty.
The stories are pleasant enough but not exactly compelling.  Sometimes
there are even different versions of the same story.  Other times, a
speaker will tell a story but question the veracity of the person he
heard it from.
Thanks to Fei Zhao's radiant cinematography, the picture looks terrific.
Shot in warm tones of burgundy and gold, the foreground contrasts nicely
with the cold, gray, overcast skies.  In a movie in which so little
happens -- Emmett likes to wile away his time shooting rats at the dump
and watching trains -- the visuals provide much of the enjoyment.  The
script is remarkably bereft of memorable lines and lacks much of Allen's
signature comedic punch.
The movie's fatal mistake is the remarkably underwhelming playing by
this putatively famous guitarist.  Although the film's jazz background
score is lush, Emmett's playing isn't.  The song he plays most often
isn't likely to wow audiences in the first place -- "I'm Forever Blowing
Bubbles."  Why couldn't they have come up with more impressive musical
choices for such a jazz great?  When Emmett plays, it's quite pleasant
but rarely more than that.
SWEET AND LOWDOWN runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and
some substance abuse and would be fine for teenagers.

movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---
It comes as little surprise that Woody Allen, one of great filmmakers of 
the our time, has created another gem in Sweet and Lowdown. It ain't 
Manhattan or Annie Hall, but it is at the top of 1999's  class, a strong 
statement about the filmmaker's talent.   
Allen has previously ventured into risquE9 territory when he had =
characters break role in Annie Hall and made Celebrity, a 1998 film, in 
black and white. Here he has created a mockumentary that is infinitely 
more realistic than The Blair Witch Project and might even create some 
consequent believers.
The film opens with Woody Allen being interviewed about a jazz guitarist 
named Emmet Ray who briefly flourished in the 1930's but is mainly 
remembered only by aficionados. Soon Allen and other interviewee's 
stories are acted out in segments by a typically recognizable Woody 
Allen cast including Sean Penn, John Waters and Uma Thurman. These bits 
are intertwined with continued interviews.  
The assumption made is that this guitarist, Emmet Ray, was a major 
insider influence and Allen has decided to make a movie paying tribute 
to him. Ray was an oddball who got kicks out of watching trains, 
shooting rats and performing drunk. But he was the finest guitarist in 
the world and he knew it. . . "except for this gypsy guitar player in 
France," as he always had to insert. The gypsy in question was Django 
Reinhardt and Emmet twice fainted in his presence. The film follows 
Emmet through a couple of women, including one mute girl, and his 
experiences as a musician, hustler and part time pimp.
There is absolutely no reason that any of the things in Sweet and 
Lowdown couldn't have happened. But they didn't. Emmet Ray is work of 
pure fiction, although there was, undisputedly, a major jazz scene in 
the 1930's and a great guitarist named Django Reinhardt. Allen follows 
through with this fantasy to the point of even having the experts being 
interviewed disagree on certain issues. There is little doubt that at 
least one moviegoer will embarrass him or herself in the near future by 
requesting an Emmet Ray album in Sam Goody.
Emmet's personality is well expressed even beyond dead rats and speeding 
trains. He is also a kleptomaniac, something that probably serves to 
feed his monster sized ego. He won't allow himself to ever fall in love, 
but doesn't mind having girls live with him. Yet the guitarist also 
manages to justify all his wrongs in his own sick and twisted head. His 
extremely undesirable traits makes the supposed documentary all the more 
insightful.
Woody Allen's films, more often than not, mirror himself. In many ways, 
Emmet Ray is just an exaggerated reflection of the brilliant filmmaker. 
He has odd female companions in the aforementioned mute girl and other 
cartoon-like companions, works a small but appreciative music scene and 
is one of the best at his trait. Allen certainly has an abnormal female 
life that has come to light recently, continues to make independent 
films for an appreciative art-house crowd and is, indisputably, one of 
the greatest at what he does.

The history of Jazz music is filled with interesting characters, often
talented and flawed individuals who excel at their skills, but unable
to succeed by normal standards. This is a fictional story presented as
semi-documentary about a supremely talented Jazz guitarist and his
obscure life. On the surface, this appears to be a typical Woody Allen
film, sans Allen as an actor. It features typical Allen elements, a
flawed antihero, love of music, and an examination of the redemptive
value of art.
Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) is a legendary guitarist who is hailed by
aficionados, but generally unknown outside Jazz circles. Because of
his lack of breakthrough success, little is know about his past, and
what is known may be exaggerated, or even false. The structure of the
film is that of a documentary with dramatic recreations. Several music
enthusiasts and historians relate what they know about Ray in talking
head format, and their stories flow into extended dramatic portrayals
without narration.
Ray's story centers around the peak of his career. As an itinerant
musician, he is able to dazzle women and has a different girlfriend in
the different parts of the country. On day on the Atlantic City
boardwalk, he encounters the mute Hattie (Samantha Morton). Although
he is initially not much enamored of her, her quiet character clearly
forms a complement to his outgoing, loud persona. He reluctantly
allows her to accompany him and his traveling band. Eventually, the
renegade artist pays a price for his lack of conscience, but like a
true artist, he never is able to (nor really wants to) reform.
Woody Allen film generally fall into three categories: comedies,
engaging dramas with humor, and engaging dramas without humor. This
film does not fit easily into any of those slots, and this iconoclasm
is not a virtue. The little humor that does exist is very simple and
uninspired. The drama of the film is unmoving. The acting, which is
usually a strong feature of Allen films, is hamstrung by poorly
sketched characters, with the exception of Morton as Hattie.
Not recommended. By Woody Allen standards, this is a bad film. By
general standards, it is merely slow and dull. The drama is not
engaging, and there is little humor. It attempts to examine the
typical Allen antihero, the loutish artist, but it fails to construct
an interesting story.

Woody Allen can do no wrong? Wrong. But he's done right so many times 
that he is a beacon of filmmaking. As in "Sweet and Lowdown."
The picture relates and shows part of the life of Emmet Ray, a 
fabulous jazz guitar player of the early to mid- Thirties,  But the 
man never existed. He is an invention, a construction, a fabulation, 
even though several aspects of him and his life have been gathered 
from a number of stories about real musicians.
Telling the audience about Emmet are interspersed talking heads of 
real people, supposedly all jazz specialists. Some are indeed 
connoisseurs: Woody Allen himself, Ben Duncan, Nat Hentoff,  Douglas 
McGrath.  Others are not.
It is not something new for Woody. This work is the kissin' cousin of 
"Zelig," and of fantasies in which jazz or pop music plays a major 
role: "Radio Days," " Bullets Over Broadway," etc. It is also variant 
of the structure of "Broadway Danny Rose" whose life-story was told 
in reminiscences by showbiz people.
The fictional Emmet Ray was, by his own accounting and those of 
others, the second best jazz guitar player in the world, after the 
legendary  (and real) Django Reinhardt. Django was a gypsy, born in 
Belgium but a French star for all practical purposes. A childhood 
accident - a fire - had deprived him of three fingers in ome hand, 
yet his playing was stupendous. To this day, he is a deity, 
remembered by millions. His pieces are played by thousands (in Django 
style) in Reinhardt groups.
He was such a cult figure for Emmet that the latter fainted on the 
two occasions he was in the same place as the gypsy. (There's a 
wonderful twist on this late in the movie).
Emmet was all musician. Outside his performances he was not a model 
to follow. Indeed, "lowdown" fits him well. He was undependable and a 
pain for those who hired him to play. He always spent way above his 
means, and blithely even resorted to pimping to supplement his 
income. He was a kleptomaniac. He hustled people (as in a small-town 
amateur contest, shown in the movie). He drank a lot, did drugs .But 
he did have friends, including black musicians. He was totally 
oblivious of the color line.
His quirks included love of trains, train-yards, and  going to city 
dumps to shoot rats with a pistol. He liked elegant suits and 
expensive cars. (Note the gorgeous $4,000 big  Packard convertible, 
and enjoy the imaginative, Munchausen-like way he got the money for 
it!)
Above all, it is his obsession with Django that hovers around him 
from the first to the last scenes. But he was so good that his 
Django-mania becomes a wonderful reminder that true artists always 
want to surpass themselves. That one can be a scoundrel and an artist 
at the same time is a true-to-life leitmotif throughout the movie.
At some point, Emmet and his best pal are in Atlantic City for a gig. 
Girl-hunting on the boardwalk, they meet statuesque Ellie and her 
rather mousy friend, the laundress Hattie. Flipping a coin Emmet gets 
stuck with Hattie --who turns out to be mute and who will become his 
companion for a long stretch.
Her treatment in his hands is not exactly nice. Some people see in it 
a case of misogyny transferred from Woody to Emmet. I don't buy that. 
First because Woody's misogyny is no proven fact. Secondly because 
Emmet shows that everything about him is overshadowed, even 
preempted, by his love of music. What autobiographical sides of 
Woody's are obvious here are a passion for jazz and a passion for 
filmmaking.
Unlike so many Woody creatures, Emmet is the non-intellectual "par 
excellence." No metaphysics, no deep (or even shallow) thoughts. No 
developed language skills,  no culture other than musicianship. Emmet 
is an instinctive being. So are almost all others, including Hattie. 
Including too the gunman Al Torrio who later in the film becomes the 
lover of Emmet's wife. No, not Hattie, but socialite Blanche who 
likes to slum, thinks she is a writer, and entraps (or does she?) 
Emmet.
The movie's great joys are three. The structure. The superb hot jazz 
music. And the fantastic performance by Sean Penn. He is economical, 
non-flamboyant, not even terribly much developed (but what would 
there be to develop?), yet three-dimensional and unforgettable in his 
intensity with and for the guitar. He wears a funny little mustache 
which must be a reference to Django's own. (Several of Reinhardt's 
personal traits, such as undependability, have been worked into Ray's 
character).
Among the earliest pieces we hear are some Django recordings (four 
star stuff) and a splendid Howard Alden rendition of "Speak to Me of 
Love" (Parlez-moi d'Amour), a gem of a song made into a classic by 
the French singer Lucienne Boyer. There's irony in the early use of 
this first piece --whether planned or just a lucky choice I do not 
know. In either case, it is a fitting overture to a tale in which no 
one speaks of love, except for voiceless Hattie who speaks it with 
her face.
The ratio of thirty-four pieces to the movie's 95 minutes is 
heartwarming, a pleasure for all, a major treat for connoisseurs, a 
feast for those who, like Woody Allen, are enamored of such oldies.
And how magnificently does Emmet Ray play his guitar!  It goes 
without saying that it is not Sean Penn who makes the sounds. But he 
was coached to perfection by Dick Hyman and by virtuoso guitarist 
Howard Allen (whose playing we hear) so that his body language and 
his plucking fingers (shown in many closeups) look entirely genuine. 
What the movie does is to go back to the old-style special effects 
that fool you -- without computers or techno-tricks.
The acting by all is excellent, with top, Oscar-worthy honors going 
to  Sean Penn and Samantha Morton. She is another throwback, to the 
actresses of silent days. Which movie star she will remind you of 
depends on your familiarity with old cinema. In a juicy tidbit (and 
in-joke) Hattie is "discovered" by a Hollywood studio and given a bit 
part as Norma Talmadge's sister. It does not pan out.
It is worth noticing that Allen's visual strategy (aided by a great 
Chinese cinematographer who is not yet 40) includes the sparse use of 
closeups, perhaps in order to avoid thrusting emotions at the public, 
and to let it decide through the framing of people within contexts of 
period surroundings, mood and music. This adds to the fact that Woody 
Allen has made a work in which sights, and especially sounds, ought 
to enchant mature and/or informed audiences. In more than one sense, 
the older the listener, the better.

SWEET AND LOWDOWN (director/writer:Woody Allen; cinematographer: Zhao
Fei; cast: Sean Penn (Emmet Ray), Samantha Morton (Hattie), Uma Thurman
(Blanche), Anthony LaPaglia (Al Torrio), Brian Markinson (Bill Shields),
Gretchen Mol (Ellie), Vincent Guastaferro (Sid Bishop), James Urbaniak
(Harry), John Waters (Club Owner, Mr. Haynes), Nat Hentoff (Himself),
(1999)
A very pleasing rendition of a Woody Allen film, directed and written by
Woody. It is a fictional docudrama that smacks of Woody's playfulness
and love for jazz, and his inability to tell a straight story, but his
great ability to tell a very personal one, which in this case is a very
suitable way of telling it. The film, also, is in many ways, a homage to
Woody's favorite directors, Fellini and Bergman, both of whom he is
obsessed with, just like the Sean Penn character is obsessed with a
fellow musician, Django Reinhardt, in the film.
The film also has the good sense to reach for Woody's unique wit to get
it through a few dry spells in the story. The joke that made me laugh
the loudest, was when Sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for
about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell
him, what do you expect, it's a Jewish holiday! It was the timing and
the facial expressions seen on Sean Penn that made those kind of jokes
work.
Casting Sean Penn in the lead as the fictional, flamboyant jazz
guitarist, Emmet Ray, was undoubtedly a wise choice on Woody's part, as
he fits the role remarkably well, playing the second-best jazz guitar
player in the swing world of the 1930s, who was also a pimp, drunk,
egomaniac, wastrel, kleptomaniac, womanizer, and oddball, besides
actually being a great artist. He explains all his moral deficiencies
away, by saying, he is an "artist."
There are some marvelous Sean Penn jazz riffs on the guitar dubbed in by
Howard Alden and some musical scores updated from the work of Django
Reinhardt by Bucky Pizzarelli. The music was just beautiful to listen to
and was played often enough during the course of the film, which should
be pleasing to the aficionados of jazz.
To highlight his story with an air of authenthicity, Woody uses a number
of experts on jazz to drily add information on the life of the invented
second-greatest guitarist in the world, Emmet Ray, whose awe for Django
Reinhardt, the French Gypsy guitarist, whom he considers to be the
greatest player in the world, borders on hysteria, as the only two times
he met him, he fainted. One such expert is the current writer for the
Village Voice, Nat Hentoff, who plays himself.
The film relies on the quirkiness of Penn's performance to tell its
lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness, which captures the
flavor of that period. It also tells of how as an artist he is a
natural; he just knows how to play and has a certain grace to him when
he plays, but when he is away from his music, he is a born loser and a
braggart, messing up his life because he is a shell of a human being,
afraid to fall in love or talk in earnest about himself, instead always
showing off that he can throw any woman aside. His other peculiarity is
to dress outlandishly in outfits that you need to wear sunglasses to
kill all the glare coming from them. He also has a Hitler-like mustache,
that looks comical on him, making his very expressive facial features
flash with moods of sadness and a zany mischieve in his eyes. He is not
really a good fellow away from his mistress, the guitar; he is much too
self-absorbed to care a lick about someone else. His hobbies include,
stealing knick-knacks, watching the trains go by and shooting rats in
the town dumps.
What changes his life for awhile and should have made him a happy man,
but turned out in the end to be just another mess up in his life, is his
relationship with the mute laundress he picked-up on the Boardwalk in
Atlantic City, Hattie (Samantha), who looks like the silent screen star
Mabel Normand. She has a heart of gold and offers him her unconditional
love. Her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies,
as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was
feeling at the time were clearly seen; all the long- sufferings that she
has gone through. She also has a most pleasing smile, that anyone could
understand. She is a physical person, loving to eat, have sex, and
listen to his music; and, that she can hear, means that she also has to
hear all the crude remarks directed at her by Emmet, who cannot open
himself up to how he truly feels, but has to put her down constantly.
What he is good at, besides playing the guitar, is foolishly spending
money and living without a concept of how he is living. If he sees a
flashy car that he likes, he only knows that he wants to buy it. When
his manager Sid Bishop (Guastaferro) tells him he can't keep spending
money he doesn't have and puts him on an allowance, he still tells Sid
that he wants the car and can save the money, he will do that by telling
Hattie to cut out desserts.
Eventually dumping Hattie, like he has done to all his other women, he
meets a socialite hussy, in need of inspiration from the artist, by the
name of Blanche (Uma), who thinks of herself as a writer, always
questioning the inarticulate artist about what he is thinking about when
he is performing. On a whim, he marries her and their doomed marriage
goes downhill when the unreliable Emmet loses his latest gig because he
doesn't show up and she starts an affair with a gangster (LaPaglia), the
bodyguard for the nightclub owner who fired him. When Emmet trails them
to follow up on the gossip he hears that his wife is having an affair,
several versions are told through the stories the jazz experts heard.
All the stories are so far apart, that none of the ridiculous versions
could be verified by any of the experts, but what all the stories have
in common, is that he hid in the backseat of the gangster's car and
heard for sure that they were having an affair.
In the end there is pathos, as Emmet is left alone, not understanding
what he had until Hattie left his life for good and he was unable to
make real contact with another woman. The woman he loved and who loved
him, couldn't result in a happy relationship because he was so full of
hubris. That he, at least, realizes this, doesn't make him a happier
person, it is too late for that, but the jazz experts tell us that he
became a better musician, able to put more of his feelings into the
music. Though they have no more stories to tell about him; he seemed to
disappear off the face of the world.
Woody's film is an appealing look back at that age of swing music and
maybe a composite glimpse of how some jazzmen lived their lives. The
great music played incudes the following renditions: "Sweet Sue," "All
of Me,"  "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I'll See You in My Dreams."
It also brings to the greater public's attention a real legend in guitar
music, Django Reinhardt, the gypsy jazz guitarist from the Paris of the
1930s-1950s; he played a great guitar despite having lost his fingers in
a childhood accident.

Vintage jazz aficionados will appreciate Woody Allen's
fanciful mock documentary about a legendary musician of the 1930s,
allegedly the second-best jazz guitarist in the world. This totally
fictional character, named Emmet Ray and embodied by Sean Penn, is a
jaunty, self-absorbed egotist who justifies his aloof, amoral behavior
by explaining that he's an "artist."  Ray lives in awe of his idol,
Django Reinhardt, the son of gypsies who lives and plays in France,
and brashly admits that loves his guitar more than any woman who ever
shared his bed. There are two memorable women with whom the itinerant
Ray becomes involved. First, he lives with the long-suffering,
worshipful Hattie (superbly played by British actress Samantha
Morton), a mute laundress whom he picks up on the Boardwalk on the
Jersey shore. Then, he impetuously marries the beautiful, bitchy
Blanche (Uma Thurman), a socialite writer searching for
inspiration. Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol, and John Waters
contribute supporting roles, and famed Chinese cinematographer Zhao
Fei (Raise the Red Lantern) makes a memorable American film debut. The
sensational soundtrack includes I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles, Limehouse
Blues, It Don't Mean a Thing, Sweet Sue, All of Me, and I'll See You
in My Dreams, tastefully arranged by pianist Dick Hyman - but,
curiously, not the title song, written by George and Ira Gershwin for
the 1925 musical Tip-Toes. There are more than a dozen guitar solos by
the real-life Django Reinhardt, lifted from his old recordings, while
musician Howard Alden supplies the notes for Sean Penn's realistic
guitar strumming.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Sweet and
Lowdown is a genial, light-hearted, rhythm-filled 8, whimsically
proving that art imitates life.

   There's an old belief that to be a great artist, you have to
be neurotic, or psychotic, or drunk or drug-addicted.  Only
people who are aberrations, who are different in temperament
from the ordinary run-of-the-mill folks, can be truly creative. 
The brilliant guitar player who is the subject of Woody's
Allen's latest movie, Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), has us going
along with the adage--for a while.  He is so full of himself that
though he gives his all to the audience while on the stage, he
cannot relate to anyone on a human level.  Emmett is a
repressed personality who holds back his feelings so much
that he cannot stand being with one woman for too long,
however loving she may be, and he is so centered on himself
that he is not even aware of hurting the feelings of those he
is with when telling them about all the other women whose
company he has enjoyed.  Ah, but later we learn that when
he reaches an impasse in his life, when his oddities catch up
with him and make him realize how lonely he truly is, he is
ready to shuck off his ill-mannered narcissism: his music,
brilliant though it had been, undergoes a warmth, a depth, a
genuine improvement.  The moral?  If you want to attain
greatness, at the very least, be normal.
   Woody Allen has written and directed this film, a
considerable improvement over his last work, "Celebrity,"
which made the fatal mistake of casting Kenneth Branagh as
a stand-in for himself.  Branagh, the very antithesis of the
nebbishy Allen, embarrassed himself and his audience by
playing so far against type that he evoked snickers, not
laughter, from the audience.  This time Allen stays behind the
camera for the most part, appearing only now and then to
narrate some commentary about the musician whose life he
describes.  Woody Allen, who is said to be truly relaxed and
happy not when he is acting or directing but when he is
behind his clarinet on Mondays at New York's Michael's Pub,
is an aficionado of jazz--as shown in the recent documentary
about his concert tour of Europe, "Wild Man Blues."  "Sweet
and Lowdown" is his paean to swing, blues, and ragtime, a
mockumentary about a fictional character from the 1930s who
is the world's second-best guitarist.  
  As interpreted by the marvelous Sean Penn, one of the
major actors of his generation, Emmett Ray is booked into
the lounges of fancy hotels together with a small combo but
is often too drunk or too late to please an impatient audience-
-if he shows up all.  The self-destructive Emmett, who is
scarcely aware of his own loneliness, has two hobbies: one is
shooting rats in a vacant lot, the other is watching freight
trains go by--the latter perhaps an evocation of lost youth, the
former an expression of his frustration with isolation.  He has
plenty of women, but he feels nothing for them.  He forms a
relationship with Hattie (Samantha Morton), a most unusual
tie given that Hattie is mute.  She cannot speak and therefore
is an ideal foil for Emmett, giving him plenty of opportunity to
talk about himself and to allow us in the audience to get to
know him as much as we can.  Though much of the music in
the movie is a delight--we are treated to old faves like "Sweet
Georgia Brown," "All of Me," and "I'll See You in My
Dreams"--the best scenes are of Emmett with Hattie who,
lonely as her new man, follows him around and without a
word of dialogue expresses every possible nuance of feeling. 
We know when she is jealous of the attention that other
women are paying to Ray; we are aware of her utterly bleak
sadness when she is finally rejected by him.  When she
smiles she reminds us of Federico Fellini's beloved Giulietta
Massina, and does much to convince us of the 1930s setting
which Allen has consummately evoked.
   From time to time Nat Hentoff, Woody Allen, and other jazz
enthusiasts pop up on screen to do some talking-heads spiel
about this fictional Emmett Ray, and darned if they don't
convince us that this guitarist really existed.  Photographer
Zhao Fei's camera wanders about to take in the characters
who are part of Ray's life, including socialite Blanche (Uma
Thurman) who is a would-be writer intent on gaining access
to Ray's core and who somehow convinces him to marry her. 
Anthony LaPaglia turns out as a gangster-bodyguard to
whom Blanche is attracted and who leads the jealous
husband to track the two down to a roadside Mobilgas station
where the audience is treated to three potential versions of
the shootout that occurs there.
   Many are saying that the picture is "sweet but slight," but
such a mixed compliment does the film a disservice.  Allen
tells us quite a bit about what could well be the inner life of
many a self-centered artist and shows us just how much an
actress, the remarkable Samantha Morton, can do without a
word of dialogue.  No wonder the stars of the silents were
threatened by talkies!  Able to extract every emotion known
to humankind simply by facial expressions and body
language, they believed--accurately enough in so many
cases--that communicating by voice would take our attention
away from the more faithful renditions of sentiments.  "Sweet
and Lowdown" is sensitive, funny, melodious, and utterly
charming.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 105 minutes.  (C) 1999

     I don't think any American filmmaker in my lifetime has had his
personal life as closely associated with his films as Woody Allen. For 25
years, his leading ladies on screen -- Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton, Mia
Farrow -- were his leading ladies off screen. When HUSBANDS AND WIVES --
his last film with Farrow before their break-up became a tabloid staple --
came out in 1992, critics observed it in terms of the disintegration of
their real-life relationship. DECONSTRUCTING HARRY was seen as a
justification for someone to live as a complete jerk provided he also
created great art (and got younger women in the process). The compulsively
auto-analytical Allen created a classic film persona, but he also created
a monster: a body of work constantly being read for clues about its
creator.
     SWEET AND LOWDOWN is framed as the documentary biography of a great
but little-known (read: fictional) jazz guitarist of the 1930s named Emmet
Ray (Sean Penn). Widely regarded by scholars as second only to the
legendary Django Reinhardt among jazz guitarists, Emmet also has a few
minor personal quirks. He's a womanizer. He's a kleptomaniac. He's an
alcoholic. He's a part-time pimp. He's an egomaniac. And he spends every
dollar in his pocket before he actually has it in his pocket. But he's a
player whose artistry causes women to swoon and club owners to forgive his
chronic unreliability.
     At first, it may sound like another apologia for the artist as
world-class clod, a la DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, but there's actually
something more going on in the character of Emmet Ray. As played by Penn,
Emmet has bought into the clich of the artist as self-destructive free
spirit. He proudly announces to his various women his need to "be free;" 
he wears the fanciest clothes to support his image; he shoots junkyard
rats for entertainment. When he tells every listener that he's the
greatest guitar player there is -- "except for this gypsy" -- he's
desperately trying to defend his life. If he's not the best there is at
his art, he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from
emotional connection.
     I'm coming to believe that Sean Penn may be the most talented 
American actor alive. His ability to take characters like Emmet Ray and
DEAD MAN WALKING's Matthew Poncelet and give them a sympathetic soul
without softening them is an extraordinary gift. Penn does so many things
right as Emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that Allen doesn't quite
know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant. 
The light-hearted structure, with jazz scholars commenting talking-head
style on Emmet's misadventures, becomes jarring and distracting as Emmet's
story unfolds. Episodes like Emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent
contest or his role in a botched hold-up (told in three possible
variations) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a Woody Allen
sensibility. Only when Allen holds Penn unexpectedly in the dead center of
a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd
usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what
he has working for him.
     Samantha Morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a
mute laundress with whom Emmet has a lengthy relationship, and it's 
certainly an impressive physical performance. It's also clear how much
Morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story, only to be
replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered Uma 
Thurman. But this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead
performance of a fascinating character, in spite of a structure always on
the verge of sabotaging that character. You might suspect that the
notoriously private Allen was using SWEET AND LOWDOWN as a first attempt
to really open himself up emotionally on screen, but found it so awkward
that he had to keep telling jokes. Or maybe he's just an imperfect
filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film.

Few filmmakers have the courage and honesty to openly portray their
psyche, flawed as it may be, in their films.  Woody Allen, among other
things, is one of these filmmakers.  In each one of his brilliant
character studies, there is more than a bit of self-deprecation; never
too subtle to recognize.
And watching `Sweet And Lowdown', his wonderful new film,
it's not hard to see why subtlety isn't his main priority.  What
makes his films so entertaining is that he is the poster-boy for
modern American, middle-aged (and dare I say Jewish) neurosis, and not
the least bit ashamed of it.  `Sweet And Lowdown', Allen's
32nd feature film, is highly enjoyable, funny and unpredictable.
It is his first movie which characterizes his well-publicized
infatuation with jazz music.
In the film, Woody's alter ego is Emmet Ray (Sean Penn); `the
second greatest guitarist in the world,' and quite proud of it.
Emmet's story is told `mockumentary' style; narrated by Woody
Allen and other noted jazz aficionados.  He is a fine musician, but a
flawed character; one so self-involved that his only companionship is
found in a mute woman named Hattie (Samantha Morton, in a dazzling
performance), who listens but never retorts.
This amusing relationship makes up the core of the film, and it works
very well thanks in part to Sean Penn's over-the-top antics.  But
it is Samantha Morton, who has appeared in a few British productions,
who steals the show with her silent vulnerability.  She utters not a
single line, yet she is a shoo-in (at least in my book) for a handful
of awards.
`Sweet And Lowdown' is otherwise an entertaining series of
occurrences in Emmet Ray's lifetime, which includes living out his
favorite pastime (shooting rats at a garbage dump), and a chance
meeting with Django Reinhardt (the greatest guitarist in the world,
according to Emmet).  The film's light tone is more like `Radio
Days' than `Crimes And Misdemeanors'.
Many will say that `Sweet And Lowdown' is too slight to be a
comic triumph, but I enjoyed every minute, which was probably the
filmmakers' intention.  The superb supporting cast includes Uma
Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol and James Urbaniak (from
`Henry Fool', which was indeed a comic triumph), all of whom
shine in small roles.
Woody Allen is back at peak form, doing what he does best without
offending anybody.  With so many `edgy' films being made as a
new wave of filmmaking approaches, it's nice to see that some still
`make em like they used to.'
It's also interesting to point out that Woody Allen may be the
hardest working artist in film today.  I'd be hard-pressed to name
another who puts out a film every year.  But Woody does it, and he
does it well.  What makes Allen one of the most talented filmmakers of
the century is that he realizes, as others should, that true
inspiration can only be found within oneself.

     Woody Allen loves jazz.  He loves jazz so much that he regularly
skips the Oscars to play clarinet with his jazz combo.  He talks about
jazz all the time.
     I love Woody Allen, really I do.  I'm probably the only living
critic who enjoyed CELEBRITY.  I love jazz, too.  Every Wednesday for
two years, I saw a classic jazz quartet play tunes like "All of Me,"
"Rosetta," and "Old Man Time" in a dank cellar bar.
     Woody Allen loves jazz so much he made up a guy and made a
fictional documentary about him.
     Played by Sean Penn, Emmet Ray is a supposed wild jazzman of the
1930's.  He drinks hard, pimps whores in his spare time, falls for a
mute woman (Morton), has a fling with a high-society dame (Thurman), and
plays a little guitar along the way.
     Sounds exciting, but unfortunately the actual story is so boring
and uneventful that it's hard to care about any of this.  At 95 minutes,
I was sure this would be light and breezy Allen fare.  It was the
longest hour-and-a-half of my life.
     Parts of the film are great, mainly a moment near the finale, when
three different versions of a humorous incident in Ray's life are played
out.  The jazz is great, but there's surprisingly little music in the
film.  It mainly serves as a lullaby to play while you blissfully fall
asleep in your chair.
     What's worse is that the structure just plain doesn't work.
Allen's so-called "expert interviews" talking about Ray are intercut not
with faux documentary footage, but with a regular movie.  Sony is trying
to quietly position SWEET AND LOWDOWN as a "real" documentary, but this
ain't no BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.
     Instead, it's just a muddled mess, a character in search of a
story, a filmmaker in search of his muse.

_Sweet_and_Lowdown_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
"Lowdown" describes the main character in Woody Allen's annual project,
an anecdotal look at the life of Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), a gifted jazz
guitarist from the '30s whose skills and talent rank second only to his
idol, gypsy Django Reinhardt.  While he cries while listening to Django's
recordings and had fainted the two times he had seen him in person, the
true number one in Emmet's book is Emmet himself.  Boozy, a jerk to
everyone around him, and legendarily self-absorbed, it's amazing that
Emmet's story has ever been told before.
 The reason why it hasn't is simple: Emmet is a completely fictional
character, and the documentary-style talking head introductions to the
film's individual vignettes (by jazz historians and enthusiasts,
including Allen himself) go a long way in convincing the audience of the
film's truth.  Adding to the authenticity are the performances.  Penn is
hilarious as the pompous Emmet, but even better is the "sweet" component
of the film's title: Samantha Morton, who plays Emmet's long-suffering
laundress girlfriend Hattie--who happens to be mute.  Morton is an
absolute delight, and her marvelously cute and expressive face speak
volumes more than any lines of dialogue ever could.  There's a reason why
"sweet" comes before "lowdown" in the title, and Morton is it.

     Woody Allen seems to be as popular as ever with the public and
with the critics, but I have to say that these days he and I seem to be
on very different wavelengths.  His last few films seem to me to be
superficially written without any real characters.  His humor is
contrived and weak, and his ideas lack ginger.  Allen could have phoned
in the script for SWEET AND LOWDOWN.  It is little more than an excuse
to tie together the musical interludes.  In a film already short at 95
minutes, he puts several musical sequences.  Then he takes what could
have been one of his patented silly situations and works it out three
different ways, not one of them amusing.  After he wastes that much
time he has less plot and character development than a typical hour of
television.  And what is his theme?  If you are not a nice person you
might end up cheating yourself.  Where is the filmmaker who made LOVE
AND DEATH and the intelligent CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS?
     Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), as the film opens, is a pimp and a totally
selfish personality.  Favorite hobbies are watching trains and shooting
rats.  He happens to be the second best jazz guitarist in the world,
second to the great Django Reinhardt.  His fictional story is told, in
the style REDS, by a combination of dramatizations and by witness
interviews by experts on jazz, one of whom is Allen himself.
     As if having been given a monstrous talent was not enough Ray is
given a perfect girlfriend, Hattie (Samantha Morton).  She just sort of
falls into his lap as he meets her on the Atlantic City boardwalk.
Hattie is a mute laundress and she is beautiful.  Hattie is utterly in
love with him and transformed by his music.  Ray is too selfish and
stupid to bring himself to treat her at all well, cheating on her when
the opportunity arises and worse insulting her to her face.  After
living with her about a year he walks out on her in what should be a
key scene, but one that Allen seemingly did not bother to film.
Instead we learn about it from the witnesses.  He has left her for
Blanche (Uma Thurman), a writer with a majestic look and an affected
mode of speaking.  But eventually there is a reckoning.
     Allen has cameos for a number of celebrities, some as jazz experts
playing themselves, or as with the case of John Waters, just as a
character.  Penn seems to do Emmet Ray as effortlessly as Ray does jazz
guitar.  His guitar picking somehow looks right, though he is not
credited with any of the music.  Much more notable is Samantha Morton
as Blanche.  Her acting keeps ones eyes focussed on the screen.  Screen
actors convey most of the plot through their voices.  In the vast
majority of films, audiences get most of the plot listening to the
soundtrack.  If one is given the choice of hearing but not seeing or
seeing but not hearing a familiar film, one quickly finds that for most
films, the former is the more satisfying experience.  Silent acting has
a different sort of dynamic and really grabs the audience's attention.
The result is that Hattie is by orders of magnitude the most compelling
character in the film.  Morton brings to the role virtues that might
have been mundane in the silent era, but which seem memorable in a
sound film.
     As Allen gets older he seems more and more to be writing about
flawed people who have really ruined their personal lives.  It would be
easy to interpret his characters as any given time as being a
commentary on his own behavior.  Clint Eastwood does the same sort of
thing, but at least his film plots seem to be better developed.  SWEET
AND LOWDOWN is a superficial morality play that needed considerably
more work.  I rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to
+4 scale.

Two words could not more amply describe Woody Allen's lead Character Emmet
Ray, played picture perfectly by Sean Penn. Emmet smokes on the jazz guitar
of the early 1900's (remember that century?)and is considered the best of
his era ... well except for this gypsy guy in France.
Penn does a slick job of fluttering his fingers across the fretboard, you
might actually think he's playing. Perhaps it helps to have a brother in the
music world. I've got two of Michael Penn's CD's, if you like thoughtful
alternative/folk rock - I'd recommend giving him a try.
But the real charm of the movie is Emmet's sweet and lowdown appeal. Emmet's
idea of showing a "dame" a good time is taking her to the local dump to
shoot rats. It's one of his favorite things to do, so why wouldn't it be
enchanting to share with his date?
In a marvelous scene boozer, Romeo, pimp, kleptomaniac, music prodigy, Emmet
Ray and his buddy are out looking for babes when they stumble across Hattie
(Samantha Morton) and her friend. They quibble over which man should get
which woman. Emmet, happy to be paired with "the small one" (Hattie),
becomes uncontrollably fidgety when he learns Hattie is mute. "Hey, let's
trade - just for a while," he pleads with his buddy, "This is my day off, I
want a talking girl!"
He's so offensively childlike in his frankness, while a genius with the
guitar. That makes for a rich character. Penn, one of the finest actors of
our time, revels in all his sincere absurdity.
Samantha Morton aptly fills her character's shoes without a word, while Uma
Thurman showing up later adds little to the picture. Woody himself appears
as one of a panel of modern-day jazz experts who comment on Emmet Ray
stories directly to the camera, making the film a mock-documentary.
I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but this is a good one.
