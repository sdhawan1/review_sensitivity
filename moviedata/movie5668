     This is one party to which you may wish to bring along Kleenex.
It's about AIDS and about someone who is about to die as the fatal day
approaches.  Nick Stark (Eric Roberts) is an architect, handsome,
healthy-looking, personable and with a great sense of humor.  Unlike
most cases where the AIDS virus has withered the ill person with lost
weight, pain, etc., Nick's has attacked his brain.  His doctor has
told him that in two days his vision, already beginning to blur, will
disappear and he will go into a coma until he dies.
     But Nick is not one to succumb that easily.  He does not want
tears and heartbreak to surround his last days.  Instead he wants to
die with dignity and arranges for that day with his friend, Tony (Paul
Regina) that in two days he is to administer the pills that will put
him to "sleep" forever.  Meanwhile, he invites friends and family to
a sort of going away party.  He wants it to be uplifting, without
tears ... but of course, those who have been invited know that tomorrow
is his last afternoon, that the next day he will be dead.  Not exactly
a party but that is what Nick has opted for.  Dignity above all.
     Some of those who attend are his mother (Lee Grant) and the
father (George Segal) who is divorced from the mother and who has
never been close to Nick and is now confronted by a loving, dying son.
There is his devoted sister, Daphne, (Marlee Matlin), a friend,
Charlene (Magaret Cho). and Nick's ex-lover, Monty (Bronson Pinchot)
who had deserted Nick when he learned he had AIDS.
     Sad?  Yes.  Heartwarming?  Also yes.  This is a different
aspect of the devastation of AIDS and how some people handle their
final moments.  A film not to be missed.
