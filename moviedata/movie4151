"In the Mood" is a light comedy based on the true
story of Sonny Wisecarver, a fifteen-year-old boy
who made national headlines in 1944.  With the
Normandy invasion pending, the media was looking
for some 'comic relief' and found it in Wisecarver,
who had married a woman in her twenties.  He
was labelled the "Woo-Woo Kid", but according
to Wisecarver, he was "just looking for a nice
girl his age."
"In the Mood" has the outward appearance of a
love story, but the film is one big wink to the
audience.  It isn't relevant how accurate the
film is, that is, whether Wisecarver (played by
Patrick Dempsey) was actually as sweet and innocent
as he is portrayed.  What is important is that the
comedy works, that the humor is subtle rather than
obvious.  The troubles that Wisecarver continually
gets into are delivered as comedy rather than as
drama, and we are too busy laughing at him to take
him seriously.
"In the Mood" did not do well at the box office,
won no awards, and got middling critical reviews.
But a good subtle comedy can be as rare as a
snowfall in Acapulco, and "In The Mood" deserves
a second look.
The real Sonny Wisecarver has a cameo as a
mailman in the newsreel.  He calls Wisecarver
a "pervent" and a "communist".  Okay, it's
funny, but there really is a message: you
shouldn't judge celebrities from their publicity.
