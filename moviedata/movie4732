LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG, THE (director/writer: Aviva Kempner;

Kaufman/Christopher Li/Scott Mumford; editor: Marion Sears Hunter; cast:
Hank Greenberg, Virgil Trucks, Charlie Gehringer, Ira Berkow, Bob
Feller, Dick Schaap, Alan Dershowitz, Walter Matthau, Shirley Povich;
Runtime: 95; 1998)
It could be almost like a documentary that someone like ESPN would do,
such as there 'When Baseball was a Game,' but in this Depression-era
nostalgia piece about a genuine Jewish baseball superstar  --
supposedly, the first one who openly said he was Jewish and wouldn't
change his name -- the game becomes much more than what it is. It
becomes a look at the social and political climate of America just as
much as a baseball biography. This breezy documentary by the woman
director, Aviva Kempner, which took her 12 years to get enough funds to
release it, sings the praises of  the likable original "Hammering Hank,"
a baseball Hall of Fame slugger and an heroic figure among his Jewish
fans, and it relates the anti-Semitism that was present in the 1930s and
1940s. He was hailed as a messiah, a counter argument against those who
never imagined a Jew could be such a physical player, a star in
America's game. He broke the stereotype people had of Jews, because of
his natural ability and physical presence. Alan Dershowitz, the infamous
lawyer, says that he was the most important Jew of that period, giving
hope to all the others through his accomplishments, allowing them to
think that they could fit into the mainstream. He was articulate, a
great player, a great role model, had a great work ethic, and though not
a religious Jew, he realized how important his heritage was and how
others looked up to him to do what is right, and he would not play on
Yom Kippur, even during a pennant race, thusly gaining the respect of
the American public.
Born in 1911 in the Bronx, to Roumanian immigrant parents, he grew to
six-foot-four-inches while at James Monroe H.S. and attracted baseball
scouts from the hometown New York Yankees and the Detroit Tigers, but
wisely chose to sign with the Tigers because the great Lou Gehrig was a
fixture at first base for the Yanks. Also, the Tiger scout promised his
parents that they will let him go to college. But baseball was in Hank's
blood and he signed a bonus to play with Detroit forgoing his education
at N.Y.U., and after a short stint in the minors, he was called up to
the big club for the 1933 season. He immediately fitted into the team,
playing on an infield that had the great second baseman Charlie
Gehringer, an infield that would eventually set a record for how many
r.b.i's it would drive in. The team was good enough to win the pennant
in 1934 and give life to a town that was hit hard by the Depression.
Detroit was also noted for having two of the most vociferous
anti-Semites, Henry Ford and Father Coughlin, and for some bigoted fans
who couldn't accept him, calling him a sheenie and a kike from the
stands. But most of the vicious taunts came from opposing teams, who all
employed bench jockeys to call him anti-Semitic names. Of all the white
ballplayers, he was picked on the most because of his religion.
Interestingly, Jackie Robinson came up in 1947 the same year Hank called
it quits. Jackie went on to break the color-line and was the only player
to receive a harder time than Hank. It was as if Hank was passing the
baton to Jackie.
He was the first ballplayer to earn $100,000, which came during his last
season when he was suspiciously traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on the
whim of Tiger owner Mr. Briggs and not allowed to end his career with
the Tigers.
Greenberg's accomplishments on the ballfield are legendary. During the
1938 season, he was chasing Babe Ruth's 60 home-run record, and ended up
hitting 58 homers. He was the team leader that helped power the Tigers
to consecutive pennants in 1934 and 1935, as the Tigers won their first
World Series in '35. In 1945, after being the first ballplayer to enlist
in the service, he returned from World War 11 to lead the Tigers to
another pennant. Hank was proudest of the runs he drove in, in one year
he drove in 183 runs, one less than the record held by Gehrig. He also
became the first man to win most valuable player awards at two
positions, first base and left field. There is no doubt about it, Hank
was an inspiration to many people who needed such a heroic figure.
This film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone
era, doing it in an effortlessly grand style, with a tongue-in-cheek
humor. Besides, any film that has a clip of the Marx Brothers breaking
up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game, has a good
idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the
slurs Hank had to go through. Hank was a class act, never openly
complaining about what he went through, just talking about it because
that was the real way it was. He never even complains about how the
pitchers stopped pitching against him when he was closing in on the
Babe. He became living proof of Jewish acceptance in America. This
documentary makes use of the ones who loved Hank, by interviews with his
family, his fans, other players, sports writers, and celebrities.
The only fault of the film, was that the director became too close to
his subject, and perhaps, overdramatized the effects of Greenberg.
Though he was the ultimate Jewish sports hero of the time, there were
others who played important roles in allowing the Jews to become more
easily accepted into the American mainstream. The conclusion of WW11
also had a lot to do with the change of America's attitude, though it is
doubtful if anti-Semitism is through for good, as there are still other
barriers in America that have to be broken down, such as having a Jewish
president.

There isn't anything surprising in this biography of baseball legend
Hank Greenberg.  There are clips of his illustrious career with the
Detroit Tigers in the 30s and 40s, as well as interviews with
Greenberg, his family, his fans, his teammates, assorted sportswriters,
and even actor Walter Matthau (Hanging Up) and attorney Alan M.
Dershowitz.
What The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg doesn't include is an
interview with my grandfather, who met Greenberg while they both served
in the United States Army during World War II.  My grandfather, who was
a photographer, saluted Greenberg and asked if he could take his picture
for the base or the Post newspaper.  `If you want pictures of me,'
Greenberg growled, `get in contact with the West Coast Training
Command.'  So did my grandfather hold a grudge?  `I hated him from then
on, even though he was a good hitter.'  Did the grudge filter its way
down to my generation?  Of course not, but I will point out that
Greenberg died in 1986 and my grandfather is trying to score tickets to
see Ken Griffey, Jr. play in the Cincinnati Reds spring training camp.
Of course The Life and Times portrays Greenberg in a much rosier light
than my grandfather did.  The lumbering lefty was, after all, the
original Hammerin' Hank.  If you grew up in the Bronx during the 30s or
40s, Greenberg was so admired that people assumed that he would become
the first Jewish President of the United States of America.  His Jewish
fans dubbed the first baseman the Moses of Baseball.  Greenberg wasn't
the first Jewish ballplayer, but he was certainly the best of his day,
if not of all-time.  He was also one of the first to keep his
un-Gentile-sounding name before going professional.  Greenberg's
reluctance to hide his religion became a constant source of pride within
the Jewish community, and the slugger became their biggest role model.
Like Jackie Robinson two decades later, Greenberg endured a barrage of
anti-Semitic taunts from hecklers and from opponents.  During his first
major league season in 1934, he had the added pressure of being on a
team involved in a pennant race that coincided with two major autumn
Jewish holidays.  Faced with a tough decision that pitted his religion
against his beloved game, Greenberg played on Rosh Hoshanah, where he
went yard to win the game, and sat out Yom Kippur, where he received a
standing ovation from his entire congregation.
So did Greenberg really deserve the adulation and faith-induced
scrutiny?  In his first season in the big leagues, all he did was help
the Tigers establish the major league record for most RBI in a season by
an infield and lead them to the World Series, where he narrowly missed
the Series record for RBI.  In the following five seasons, Greenberg
collected two MVP awards (the first man to win at different positions),
won a World Series, missed Babe Ruth's home run record by two dingers
and Lou Gehrig's RBI record by one.  He became the first ballplayer to
volunteer for the war when he enlisted in 1941.  Missing four seasons in
the prime of his career, Greenberg returned to Detroit in 1945, when he
again led the Tigers to another world championship.  When he was
unceremoniously traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates the following season,
Greenberg became the game's first $100,000 man.  And somehow he even
found time during all of these accomplishments to piss off my ancestors.
Directed by Aviva Kempner, The Life and Times also includes clips of an
interview with former Law & Order actor Michael Moriarty, whose
grandfather was an American League umpire during Greenberg's reign of
terror.  The film opens and closes with the Marx Brothers singing `Take
Me Out to the Ballgame' in Yiddish.  And how could you resist something
like that?

         While attending the University of Michigan, filmmaker Aviva
Kempner worked as a cashier, selling movie tickets at the Michigan
Theatre in downtown Ann Arbor. Recently her name reappeared at the
Michigan, although this time it was on the screen: Her documentary "The
Life and Times of Hank Greenberg" played there last month.
 The movie, a fond look back at former Detroit Tiger star
"Hammerin' Hank," is the product of 13 years of research, writing and
fundraising, which Kempner said was inspired by her family.
 "I grew up in Detroit and I grew up a big Tigers fan," Kempner recalled
in a phone interview from her office in Washington, D.C. "My father
would take my brother and I to games all the time, and hence, I became a
Hank Greenberg fan.
 "(In 1986) when I heard Hank Greenberg had died, I knew I had
to make this film, because he was always my daddy's hero. My father had
always taught us that prejudice doesn't belong on the field or in
society, so for me, Hank Greenberg seemed an unsung hero, someone I had
to do a film about."
 But Kempner's movie is not for baseball fanatics only.
"Greenberg" paints a vivid portrait of America in the first half of the
century, a world in which many different cultures and nationalities sat
uneasily side by side in big cities such as Detroit, New York and St.
Louis. Prior to WWII, ethnic and racial slurs that would get you booted
out of a ballpark today were regularly shouted and chanted by crowds,
which meant the Jewish Greenberg had to endure all sorts of demeaning
nicknames. Yet that didn't discourage him from playing.
 "That Hank went to work every day, with all that catcalling,
and still performed, that's one of the things that makes him a real role
model for people," Kempner explained. "How many of us would have done
the same? I have such respect for the man because of it."
 Kempner, a child of Holocaust survivors, said she wanted to
make a film to help shatter the stereotype of Jewish men as "nebbishs,"
weak-willed types who are easily pushed around by everyone else.
Greenberg was well aware he was someone the Jewish community (and not a
few Gentiles as well) looked up to, and he did his best to behave
accordingly. In these times when sports figures such as John Rocker and
Dennis Rodman flaunt their bad-boy reputations, it's mildly startling to
see a man who went out of his way to put forth a positive image for his
fans. Kempner's film reveals Greenberg as someone who took his faith
quite seriously as well and actually sought advice from rabbis about
whether or not he should play on Yom Kippur.
 The most difficult part of putting the project together was
"sustaining it for so many years until it was done, keeping the faith
that I would eventually finish it," said Kempner. "I feel bad for two
things: that a lot of the people in the film, the fans and the players,
didn't live to see themselves; and two, if I'd raised the money a year
ago, maybe the film could have influenced the voting for the All-Century
Team (Greenberg was not included on that list)."
 Although the movie is finished and has earned honors at the
Hamptons International Film Festival and the International Sports Video
and Film Awards, Kempner said she's still trying to get a little more
money put together to cover the rights on the music used in the film.
She's particularly grateful for a contribution from the Kellogg
Foundation and joked, in her best Blanche DuBois accent, "I have always
depended upon the kindness of strangers."
 Kempner, who previously chronicled the Jewish resistance
movement in her 1986 documentary "Partisans of Vilna," was hesitant to
give many details on her next project, but she did allow it will
probably be another sports story, perhaps looking at a Jewish hockey
player she declined to name.
 "Telling our history is an important vehicle in making sure the
prejudice doesn't happen in society," Kempner said. "That's why I do
it." James Sanford

Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron. These players most often get thought of
when people look at prominent baseball figures from the 1930s and 1940s.
However, another great slugger of the time often gets overlooked. Hank
Greenberg, the first Jewish baseball player to not change his name to a
Christian one usually gets forgotten. Those who remember him are most likely
baseball buffs, or former residents of the Detroit area. Director Aviva Kempner
wanted to change that. After Greenberg's death in 1986, Kempner began a 12 year
struggle for funding, filming, and spreading awareness of this film. Her hard
work is evident. The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a wonderful
documentary. It's just long enough to keep it from getting boring, it has a
good amount of humor, and the interviews and cross-references are mini-marvels.
Hank Greenberg first stepped to the plate in 1934 when he got signed to the
Detroit Tigers. Throughout the season, especially when the pennant race heated
up, he has the constant target of anti-Semitic remarks from people in the
crowd. Baseball was America's game, and some believed Jews shouldn't be allowed
to play it. Greenberg gained popularity by hitting most often one or two home
runs a game, and leading his team to the pennant. For so many people though, he
was much more than a baseball player. He was a Jewish icon, a sign of hope. A
voice speaking to all Jews in America that said they could be just as
successful as the "true" Americans. In one interview a fan describes his school
days when they used to listen to baseball games on the radio during class.
Whenever Greenberg came up to the plate all the other kids would look at him,
perhaps thinking he knew whether he would hit a home run or not. Indeed he was
a sense of pride for people he hadn't even met. While Hank Greenberg was a very
tall (6'4'') and gawky man, he was not a very religious one. He rarely attended
synagogue, and played on Rosh Hoshanah, but decided not to play on Yom Kippur.
Despite this, he was still considered a religious symbol of hope. The film also
chronicles his experience in the military, as well as his final seasons with
the Tigers, and his one year playing on the Pittsburgh Pirates.
I really enjoyed The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, mostly because of its
humor and subject matter. I personally have never had a large interest in
baseball, but I found the movie entertaining because I knew very little about
the man before seeing it. It's enjoyable because we are supposed to take the
film in a light sense. All fans (mostly famous Jews including Walter Matthau,
Carl Levin, and Alan M. Dershowitz) celebrate their experience with and
memories of him with zeal. The film opens and closes with another treat, the
Marx Brothers singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in Yiddish. While we don't
get a heavy focus on racism and anti-Semitism, Kempner expects the audience to
comprehend what this man had to go through without making the racism factor
seem overwrought. In the last minutes of the movie, Hank Greenberg meets Jackie
Robinson who at that time got taunted much more than when Greenberg first
started. The two talked long after their game, and Jackie Robinson later
described Greenberg as, "Nothing but class." Itâs a kind, simple, and
somewhat sweet way to end the film. The movie is about a man and his fans with
an undeniable passion for baseball, but the film paints a larger picture. It
shows us an America on the verge of change. Well done Ms. Kempner, your twelve
years of labor are well worth it.

Aviva Kempner's THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG opens with "Take Me 
Out To The Ball Game" sung in Yiddish, which made it my second movie 
with Yiddish in a single day.  (The other was the phenomenal 
Romeo-and-Juliet story called SOLOMON AND GAENOR.)
Hank Greenberg, an amazing athlete, was the first Jew to make it big in 
the major leagues.  A "lumbering giant" on the field, he was a 6-foot-4 
first baseman who was twice named Most Valuable Player and who helped 
his team, the Detroit Tigers, win pennants and World Series.  Although a 
few Jews had some earlier, smaller successes in baseball, they changed 
their names to mask their ethnic identity.
This traditionally composed documentary tells the story of Greenberg's 
incredible career and of the prejudice that he faced.  It makes the 
point that all ethnic groups were harassed on the field, but, being the 
only Jew, Greenberg suffered more than the others like the Italians and 
the Irish.  Some of the film's talking heads, such as famous liberal 
lawyer Alan M. Dershowitz, see conspiracies afoot against Greenberg.  
When Greenberg came close to breaking Babe Ruth's home run record, 
Dershowitz claimed that the pitchers weren't being fair to Greenberg 
because he was a Jew, otherwise he would have cracked the record.  In an 
interview taped in 1983, Greenberg pooh-poohed this idea, claiming that 
he got a fair shot.  He said that he was proud to have come within 2 
home runs of Ruth's record and asked how many people can say that.
A boy from the Bronx who was born of Romanian-immigrant parents, he was 
more than just a hero to his old neighborhood, he was called the "king" 
and the "emperor."  Walking down the street, the kids flocked to him 
like a god.  "Growing up in the Bronx in the 30s, you thought of nothing 
but baseball and Hank Greenberg," Walter Matthau tells us.  Matthau says 
that Greenberg's success gave him confidence that he didn't have to go 
to work in the garment district when he grew up.
Many of the interviewees are labeled simply as "fan."  One of them says 
that they were what we call "groupies" today.  They worshiped Greenberg 
and followed him whenever they could.
Greenberg's focus generally wasn't on the more glamorous and traditional 
home runs or batting average.  Instead, he tried to get the highest 
number of RBIs (runs batted in) since that is what wins games.
The movie commendably and honestly spends almost as much time on 
Greenberg's failures as his successes.  People remember his big plays, 
but the film reminds us too of those times when he missed the key hit or 
the essential catch that could have won one of the big games. This 
approach gives the documentary a heightened sense of credibility.
When most people think of prejudice and baseball, they think of Jackie 
Robinson.  It turns out that towards the end of Greenberg's career, 
Robinson literally ran into him -- at first base.  Picking him up, 
Greenberg gave him a little advice and encouragement.  As much flack as 
Greenberg got, he said that nothing he experienced was as bad as what 
Robinson had to endure.
THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG runs 1:30.  It is not rated but 
would be a G and has nothing to offend anyone of any age.

    Those of us who think that there's something sinister,
something wrong about the political correctness movement
might have a change of mind after seeing "The Life and
Times of Hank Greenberg."  This documentary about one of
the greatest Jewish ballplayers of the century illustrates the
hatred allowed to come out of the mouths of some
degenerate Americans, Americans who somehow thought
that if a person is not a white Christian, he has no business
playing in a game that was "meant for them."  Happily the PC
movement may not have changed everyone's mind about
racial and religious minorities, but at least unhealthy slurs are
not in fashion, at least in public, as they seem to have been
during the era that saw Greenberg challenge Babe Ruth's
record of homers.  Greenberg was a player for the Detroit
Tigers from 1933-1946 before he was traded by them to the
Pirates for whom he played an additional season.  Aviva
Kempner's congenial and often rousing and humorous
documentary gives us access to some archival footage of
Greenberg both at bat and on first base and in left field.  But
her focus is foremost on the fact that Hank Greenberg was
the first Jewish baseball player who, though completely
secular, never hid his religion despite its unpopularity with the
bigots of this country.  (He was not the first Jewish ballplayer
in the Majors: a few, not named here, preceded him, but they
had apparently changed their names to pass for Christian.)
   Punctuating the documentary with Henry Sapoznik's
Klezmer-infused score, director Kempner--whose previous
work was as co-scripter and producer of "Partisans of Vilna"
(about Jewish resistance against the Nazis)--succeeds in this
12-year-long labor of love to give us a grand look at the
handsome but gawky, 6'4" athlete who served as an icon for
Jews throughout the country.  Setting her footage of pennant-
winning and series-winning baseball games against interviews
with forty-odd fans, family and celebrities, she gives us a
rounded picture of the largely anti-Semitic spirit of the times,
a spirit which led to Greenberg's being greeted by hate-filled
catcalls from the stands and in one instance even from the
bench of an opposing team.  Young people today would be
aghast to see samples of help-wanted pages from the thirties
advertising for "Christians Only" and "Must be of Anglo-Saxon
descent--as such proclamations are not only illegal today but
would be laughable outside circles like KKK, the American
Nazi party and so-called white citizens' councils.  Yet during
the 1930s a figure as illustrious as Henry Ford would publish
a book called "The International Jew" (how those of the
Jewish persuasion were corrupting capitalism and furthering
communism).  
   Documentaries are not very popular in America, the
principal reason being perhaps the fear that they are little
more than opportunities for talking heads.  Talking heads do
indeed populate the film, but those captured by Thomas
Kaufman's camera are an amusing lot, including Walter
Matthau and Alan Dershowitz.  Though not alluded to in the
film, Dershowitz, one of the country's foremost attorneys, had
written a book called "Chutzpah," in which he challenges
Jews to be proud of their heritage and do nothing to hide
their ethnic identity.  In the interview, he explains that during
the thirties and forties, Jews were supposed to be quiet, or as
they say in Yiddish "shta, shtill." Jews were damned if they
failed and damned if they succeeded, so the common wisdom
was "Don't make waves."  Greenberg becomes, therefore,
one of Dershowitz's heroes, particularly when in deference to
his heritage and out of respect for his parents, he refused to
play ball on Yom Kippur despite turning in an impressive
performance on the preceding Rosh Hashanah.  (In the
movie's most engaging note, we learn that Greenberg's rabbi,
citing the Talmud, allowed Greenberg to ply his trade on the
Jewish New Year because "children in ancient times played
sporting games in the streets of Jerusalem."  What the rabbi
deliberately hid from the ball player's ears was that those
were Roman kids, not Jewish youngsters).
   Detractors of Hank Greenberg include a cop, photographed
when giving the player a ticket for going through an amber
light and saying "Who in hell ever heard of a Greenberg
being a ball player?"  Yet another was his drill sergeant--
Greenberg took up arms in World War 2--who announced to
his men, "I don't want any Cohens or Goldbergs on my
team."  The athlete raised his hand and said, "My name is
Greenberg."  Looking at the muscular, 6'4" hero, the drill
sergeant mumbled, "I didn't say anything about Greenbergs."
   For lack of funding, Kempner persisted for 12 years to get
this film out to the public, making her, like Greenberg, a hero. 
Framed by Mandy Patinkin's singing "Take Me Out to the Ball
Game" in Yiddish against a backdrop of Bronx kids during the
Depression throwing the horsehide around the local streets,
"The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg" is well deserving of
the Audience Award it garnered from those attending its
screening at a Hamptons Film Festival.

Written and Directed by Aviva Kempner
     You don't have to be a baseball fan to love Aviva Kempner's 
documentary about legendary Detroit Tiger slugger Hank Greenberg, though 
it probably helps.
     Greenberg wasn't the first Jewish player to reach the majors, but 
he was the first to achieve stardom without downplaying his religion, 
and it made him the idol of American Jews in the decade when Hitler was 
stoking his cauldron of hate in Germany, and anti-Semitism was 
conspicuously alive and well in this country too.  Greenberg played in 
Detroit, home of such major league bigots as Henry Ford and the infamous 
Father Coughlin.  He filled the star void left by the departure of 
all-time Tiger great and world-class sonofabitch Ty Cobb.
     Greenberg was 6'4", with muscles like Paul Bunyan, and he muted the 
jeers of "kike" and "sheeny" with an awesome barrage of homers and RBIs. 
 His average never fell below .300 till his last year with the Tigers, 
after he'd returned from four years in WWII.  He was twice the American 
League's most valuable player, and that didn't include the year ('37) 
when he drove in 183 runs, one shy of Gehrig's record, or the year ('38) 
when he electrified baseball with his 58 homers, two short of the 
immortal Bambino's mark.  He was baseball's first $100,000 man. 
    "He may have been the single most important Jew to live in the 
1930s," says Alan Dershowitz.  "I thought he'd be the first Jewish 
president." 
     Greenberg wasn't an observant Jew, but he was a proud one.  In his 
second year with the Tigers he agonized over whether to play on Rosh 
Hashanah.  A Detroit rabbi sent him a Talmudic passage that okayed it, 
and Hankus Spankus walloped two homers to win a 2-0 game (the rabbi, a 
baseball fan, later admitted he'd fudged his interpretation.) When he 
declined to play on Yom Kippur, the poet Edgar Guest saluted him in the 
Detroit paper:
"We shall miss him in the infield, we shall miss him at the bat,
"He is true to his religion, and I honor him for that."
     Aviva Kempner's labor of love took her 14 years, beginning with 
interviews with the great man shortly before his death in '86.  She 
talked to teammates, opponents, sportswriters, and fans, and dug out 
vintage baseball film and Mandy Patinkin's Yiddish "Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame" for the soundtrack.  She clutters things a bit with extraneous 
footage from Hollywood baseball movies, and sometimes her narrative 
drive slumps.  It's not great filmmaking, but it's an impassioned 
treatment of a great subject.
     Poetically, Hank Greenberg ended his career with the Pirates in 
'47, bringing him to the National League the year Jackie Robinson broke 
in.  "I didn't know what having it bad was till I saw what happened to 
Robinson," he said.
