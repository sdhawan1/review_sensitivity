"Bat 21" is a different kind of Vietnam war movie.  No, not from
the Vietnamese perspective: that would be too much to expect from
Hollywood.  It does not focus on the young soldier, part of a
platoon, but instead is about a middle-aged colonel (Gene Hackman) 
shot down behind enemy lines, and a pilot (Danny Glover) who is 
determined to rescue him.
War as horror rather than heroism is a successfully explored 
theme.  The devastation of the Vietnamese countryside by the
Americans is shown, as well as the fierce fighting spirit
of the Vietnamese.  There is much tension as Hackman is always
in trouble of being discovered, and the Vietnamese stop
several abortive rescue attempts.
The relationship between Hackman and Glover, who have never met
and communicate through radio transmissions, develops to the
point where Glover is risking his life and career to save Hackman.  
Their conversations are well-scripted and believable.  Also
well done are scenes with Hackman encountering Vietnamese
farmers and children.
Perhaps is the weakest point of the film comes at the end.
Hackman and Glover survive a Yankee carpet bombing that manages
to wipe out a chasing band of Vietnamese soldiers.  It's too
bad they didn't play the lottery if they are going to be
that lucky.
Still, this is yet another important movie about the Vietnam
war, and the struggle to survive amid adversity.  A humble
film that wisely narrows its scope to Hackman's trials.
