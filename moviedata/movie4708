A wise man once said, `Yo, Chuck, hold em hostage!'  Okay, it wasn't
really a wise man  it was Flava Flav  but his point is still pretty
easy to understand.  Mr. Flav was talking about the music industry and
it's failure to recognize his explosive Public Enemy as a legitimate
threat to the bloated beast that was the music business.
While there hasn't been a decent high profile kidnapping splattered on
the front pages of newspapers in years (unless you count the abduction
of John Travolta's brain), celebrated independent filmmaker John Waters
brings the under-appreciated crime into the spotlight with his latest
film, Cecil B. Demented.
To serve as the wickedly criminal heroes in Demented, Waters (Pecker)
has created a group of disenchanted teens called The Sprocketholes, who
live in a 21st century version of Andy Warhol's Factory in Baltimore's
abandoned Hippodrome theatre.  Each Sprockethole has a tattoo of their
favorite director, ranging from the expected (David Lynch, Spike Lee) to
the startling (William Castle, Kenneth Anger).
Their leader and director, the titular Cecil B. Demented (Stephen Dorff,
Blade) is a self proclaimed prophet against profit  a true independent
filmmaker that, like Ed Wood, doesn't waste time with more than one take
of each scene.  Cecil's goal is to destroy the Hollywood system as we
know it, using his group of hell-bent terrorists to create a new cinema
underground.  According to Cecil, mainstream film has stolen the nudity
and co-opted the violence of independent film, and they must pay
dearly.  In other words, he's nuttier than Lars von Trier.
So Demented and the Sprocketholes hatch a plan to kidnap America's
favorite actress  the devilishly two-faced Honey Whitlock (Melanie
Griffith, Crazy in Alabama)  from the charity premiere of her new
screwball comedy in Baltimore.  But the kidnapping is just the
beginning.  Demented and company plan on forcing Whitlock to perform in
their own anti-establishment film that will reveal the motion picture
industry as a bunch of boobs in finely-tailored suits.
As Demened's film hurtles toward its completion, Waters' script takes
swipes at just about everything from theatre concession prices and lame
advertising displays to the MPAA and the prestigious Guilds for Acting
and Directing.  Waters seems to hold particular disdain for theatre
latecomers, critics that love every film they see, and the generation
that green-lighted feature films based on bad television shows they
worshipped as children.
Waters' self-righteous finger pointing is a great idea for a film, and
the fact that he's able to pull the picture together with a low budget
and a supporting cast of acting rookies makes Demented even more
enjoyable.  The film is a hoot, from the inventive opening credits that
jump off theatre marquees, to the big orgy bloodbath finale.  Hold em
hostage, John.

CECIL B. DEMENTED (director/writer: John Waters; cinematographer: Robert
Stevens; editor: Jeffrey Wolf; cast: Melanie Griffith (Honey Whitlock),
Stephen Dorff (Cecil B. DeMented), Alicia Witt (Cherish), Adrian Grenier
(Lyle), Larry Gilliard Jr. (Lewis), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Raven), Jack
Noseworthy (Rodney), Patty Hearst (Fidget's mother), Eric M. Barry
(Fidget), Riki Lake (Libby), Mink Stole (Mallory), Kevin Nealon
(himself); Runtime: 87; Artisan Entertainment; 2000)
What can you say about this set in Baltimore film, by the king of bad
taste, John Waters, except it is what can be expected from the director
whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become
passe since his peak days of the 1970s, when he made "Pink Flamingos."
Now his satire has become more tame than outrageous. It is ironic that
the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a Hollywood
film and has made a film that is equally as bad, if not worst. This is a
shoddy production, the comedy is lame, the acting almost non-existent,
and the satire is sophomoric, taking pop shots at an easy target such as
Hollywood, but shots that have no sting. If I laughed more, then I could
have found some justification for the film. At best, this "Demented"
could be seen as a TV sketch on "Saturday Night Live," or a straight to
video movie release. As a full-length feature, it ran out of gas shortly
after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a
lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at
what is really troubling about pop culture. It certainly can't be
because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who
go to theaters in the mall talk during the film.
The story revolves around the title character, Cecil B. Demented
(Dorff), the tyrannical and publicity seeking tousled-hair leader of a
guerrilla troupe of cinema terrorists and his crew of revolutionary
filmmakers, known as Sprocket Holes, who kidnap pampered superstar
Hollywood actress Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) at the Baltimore
premiere of her latest movie and force her to star in their own
guerrilla production, a film to be made in "ultimate reality." They
bring her to their headquarters, an abandoned theater in a garage decked
out in crass psychedelia. Demented rants that he is quite willing to die
for art and will do anything to make his film.
The movie invades recent history to play on the real story of Patty
Hearst as the victim of a political kidnapping who during her ordeal
appeared to be brain-washed into accepting her captors' cause, which
becomes the theme for the film. Patty has a small part as the concerned
mother of one of the guerilla crew members.
The kidnapping of Honey at gunpoint and her transition from reluctance
to act in their film after the guerillas take the movie house -- when
the guerillas are shouting, `Power to the people who punish bad cinema,'
while she is crying out, "Call Jack Valenti!" --  to her enthusiasm
about changing her image and acting in their film, made for some of the
most amusing scenes in the film. The kidnapping scene had some energy in
it before even that became tiresome.
There was some gentle digs at Hollywood: from poking fun at a Pauly
Shore film marathon to the mall showing only "Star Wars" and "Star Trek"
films to the set of the expensive remake of "Forrest Gump" being taken
over by the guerillas to `Les enfants du paradis' panned for being
insultingly dubbed in English to mocking the Maryland Film Commission to
the "Patch Adams" film showing of a director's cut in the mall. These
were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical. It might
have been funny on paper but when acted out, it seemed to be mild stuff,
things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days.
Melanie before her conversion to the cause of indie films, is seen
acting mean-spirited to her long-time assistant (Riki Lake). She asks
her to get the hotel manager to tell if Pat Nixon screwed in the
Presidential Suite when staying at the hotel and she also refuses to go
to her premiere in a white limo, requesting only a black one.
Melanie is pleased to learn that she has become very popular doing her
new role as a cult movie heroine, revitalizing her dying career. Her new
image starts with her satanic makeup, as applied by satan-lover Raven
(Maggie Gyllenhaal). Her co-star is a druggie comically taking any kind
of drug, Lyle (Adrian Grenier), who is supposedly a parody of a Method
actor. Everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex,
but Cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed, so they all
live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what
kind of sexuality fits them. Former porno star Cherish (Alicia Witt),
whose film `Rear Entry,' is playing in an all-Anal film marathon, in
which she co-stars with a gerbil, is now asking for legitimate
acceptance in her role in this  indie, while Jack Noseworthy as a
hairdresser, ashamed of his heterosexuality, is asking for forgiveness
for being straight.
There's not much to prove by the kidnapping, as the story is really
irrelevant. The thing here is if the character can shock you and if the
film hit your funny bone. For me, it came up close to empty in all
respects. I'll take my deranged films from Andy Warhol anytime, whose
freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them.
Here, Dorff is good enough as the Abby Hoffman characterization of a
punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist, while Griffith
is a good sport, taking in all the remarks about Honey's age, her
ego-centredness, her tantrums, her phony public demeanor and her defense
of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a Hollywood star, first
defending and then renouncing it. But I wouldn't call her performance
acting, as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as
a source for the comedy. The satire was not tough enough to make this a
biting film, but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption
to really antagonize anyone but the Christian right-wing moralists. And
since it can still at least do that, no matter how trivial this film is,
I guess, the film has a little fire in its belly... . By the way,
Water's stated in an interview that the film got its title "Cecil B.
Demented," because that's what he was called in an early review.

Hollywood is a pimp.  A fat, cigar-smoking chump wearing a fur hat and
12 gold chains around its fat, hairy chest.  All of its stars and
starlets are an evil brood of scum-sucking vampires looking for the next
percentage take, the next summer blockbuster, the next casting couch to
audition on.  Pumping out comic-book adaptations, terrible sequels to
mediocre films, and remakes of foreign films to the nearest American
movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound
systems. How much longer can the works of Peckinpah, Fassbinder, Fuller,
Castle, Preminger, and Lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections
of the local Blockbuster stores?  How many more Silver and Weinstein
films can we enduring in this stinky, decaying state of American cinema?
But now, from John "I don't give a shit what you think about my movies"
Waters, comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and
aficionados: Cecil B. DeMented, a warped and twisted tale of how far a
filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social
revolution.
Stephen Dorff, in a career-defining role, is Cecil B. DeMented, a crazed
director devoted to making the most radical underground film.  Together
with his film production cult, the Sprocket Holes - who wear tattoos of
Peckinpah, Lee, Fuller, Castle, Anger, Fassbinder, Preminger on various
parts of their bodies as badges of honor, they kidnap a Hollywood movie
starlet, played with perfect ridiculousness by Melaine Griffith, and
force her to take the starring role in DeMented's film.
With no budget and no contracts for extras, DeMented and his crew take
to the streets for production of Raving Beauty, a crass terrorist film
about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to
destroy the mainstream film business.  Using "ultimate reality" - with
real bullets, real people, and real terror - DeMented and his crew of
misfits attack a mall theater, terrorize the Maryland Film Commission
and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying
Tom Hanks film.  Demented's crewmembers are maimed and killed, popcorn
machines are used for target practice, and no one can have sex until the
film is complete.  It's like Bowfinger, only, you know, good.
The film moves with zigs and zags like the Magic Bullet of Kennedy's
assassination.  The zeal of DeMented's cause catches quickly and conveys
the urgent message of "doing something, anything, for the accomplishment
of artistic motivations."  The crewmembers all hold the quirkiness
common in Water's previous films - Pink Flamingos, Hairspray, Polyester,
Pecker -- and speak in the choppy, jaded dialogue used frequently by
Waters.  It is as if Water's script strips away the unnecessary dialogue
common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods.
Cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it
might actually outdo itself.  You can see how a major studio might take
this film, re-edit it, cut a deal with the remaining crew members who
are still alive, and make a few sequels, a la The Blair Witch Project.
But that's for the future.  Overall, the ride is fantastic; it's one of
Water's best films to date and this year's Fight Club for filmmakers.

"Power to the people and punish bad cinema!" screams director Cecil B. 
Demented (Stephen Dorff from BLADE).  He is the leader of a young group 
of cinema terrorists and a self-described "prophet against profit" in 
making motion pictures.
CECIL B. DEMENTED is another deliciously over-the-top movie by that bad 
boy of indie films, outrageous writer and director John Waters.  
Although his last picture (PECKER) was a disappointment, most of his 
movies, such as SERIAL MOM, are real treats.  And this latest one of his 
is perhaps his best ever.
Melanie Griffith, delivering her first good performance since, well, I 
don't remember when, plays the lead, a self-absorbed star named Honey 
Whitlock.  Honey coos sweet nothings to the press but, behind the 
scenes, is a trash-talking bitch.  
Waters has the audience in stitches with the opening scene, which shows 
a multiplex whose films, according to the marquee, are STAR WARS, STAR 
TREK, STAR WARS, STAR TREK, STAR WARS and STAR TREK.  These titles and 
others dissolve into the film's credits.  Keep your eye out for other 
marquees during the movie.  The best advertises PATCH ADAMS: THE 
DIRECTOR'S CUT.
Honey is kidnapped by Cecil and his band of cinema outlaws.  (Since 
Honey is kidnapped, much like Patty Hearst was, Waters, in perfect bad 
taste, gets Patty Hearst to play a cameo part in the movie.)  Cecil 
wants Honey to star in his reality-based movie.  His horny crew, which 
includes an ex-porn star, Cherish (Alicia Witt), has "taken a vow of 
celibacy for celluloid" until it's a wrap, so Cecil tells Honey that 
she's safe with them.
The movie is filled with film industry in-jokes.  Every member of the 
crew threatens Honey if she doesn't perform precisely as required.  The 
cinematographer, for example, tells her just what will happen to her if 
she doesn't hit her mark.  She is also required to do her own stunts 
even if they may kill her.  "Suffer for celluloid!" screams Cherish as 
she makes Honey leap off of a building for her art.  
The movie skewers everyone from unions to drug addicts.  "Before I was a 
drug addict, I had so many different problems," says a coke-head and 
glue-sniffer played by Adrian Grenier.  "Now I only have one problem."
Waters stages fights using fans of various film genres (family, action 
and porn), managing to poke fun at each.  A scene inside a porn house 
playing one Cherish's movies is one of CECIL B. DEMENTED's funniest 
sequences.
Waters even comes up with a catchy little song and a motto, "Demented 
Forever," that will likely stay with you and remind you of this wacky 
and thoroughly enjoyable movie.
So what is the ultimate insult to a deep, deep underground director like 
Demented?  A prudish looking, family-film aficionado tells Demented 
that, "You're direct-to-video."  Oh, the pain!
CECIL B. DEMENTED runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for strong crude 
sexual content, violence, language and drug use and would be acceptable 
for older teenagers.

Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) is in Baltimore for the world premiere
benefit of her latest flick, an event chosen by Cecil B. Demented (Stephen 
Dorff, "Blade") for her kidnapping.  Demented and his band of Sprockets
are cinema guerillas who promote anarchic filmmaking and the death of the
multiplex mainstream in director John Waters' "Cecil B. Demented."
John Waters has just about attained respectability in recent years with
his sweet natured "Pecker," satiric "Serial Mom" and nostalgic "Hairspray."
"Cecil B. Demented" begins with the audacious mania and low budget looks
of his earlier cult flicks.  Unfortunately, it can't sustain its cool
concept and devolves into a drive-in dumpster denouement.
The film begins promisingly, with movie marquees touting either "Star Wars"
or "Star Trek" in all of a six screen multiplex, "Scream 4," a Pauly
Shore marathon and (gasp) "Patch Adams, the Director's Cut."
The gloriously spoiled Honey Whitlock, so pampered she demands her 
assistant find out whether Pat Nixon had sex in her 'presidential' suite,
puts on her fake face for the dignitaries she's just dissed while 
turning her ugly face to everyone else.  Meanwhile, back at the Senator
Theater, Cecil and his Sprockets, all employed by the theater, are
setting their trap.  When Whitlock wiggles her way onto the stage, Cecil
and his gang grab her.  Weapons are drawn and a bomb goes
off.  'Power to the People!' and 'Punish bad cinema!' they cry before
loading Honey into their van and absconding to their closed movie theater
lair.
Here we get introduced to the gang, who have been sworn to a vow of celibacy 
for Demented until their film is completed.  Cherish (Alicia Witt, TV's "Cybil")
is a former porn star and Cecil's horny girlfriend.  Lyle (Adrian Grenier,
"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole") an actor zonked out on drugs of every
sort ('Before I was a drug addict, I had so many problems.  Now I only have
one.').  Aggressive cinematographer Pam (Erika Lynn Rupli, sound person and
aspiring rap star Chardonnay (Zenzele Uzoma), art director by way of staple
gun Lewis (Larry Gilliard, Jr., "The Waterboy") and satanic makeup girl Ravel 
(Maggie Gyllenhaal) comprise most of the crew.  Hairdresser Rodney (Jack
Noseworthy, "U571"), who hates himself for being straight, terrorizes
Honey with his harsh dye jobs ('I hate roots!').  The weakest link to
Cecil's cause is Fidget, the costumer, whose parents (Patricia Hearst
plays his mom) still have too much control over him.
After threatening Honey to star in his movie, Cecil and the sprockets
hit the streets for guerilla filmmaking, terrorizing film audiences
everywhere.  Soon Honey becomes bound to the cause, especially as she
realizes her new outlaw notoriety is the best thing to happen to her
career in ages (Eric Roberts makes a cameo as her ex-husband on Roseanne
Barr's talk show).  They fight parents of small children ('Family's just
another word for censorship!' Honey screams), crash local film events
(where Cecil convinces Honey to jump off a roof) and invade the filmming
of "Forrest Gump II" starring Kevin Nealon (as himself).  Lives are
lost, but the cause is strong, and local kung fu fans and a porn house
help protect them (the porn house is showing one of Cherish's old films
in which she has an adventure with a gerbil).
While all this may sound like inspired lunacy, it's only fitfully funny.
Water's best and sliest joke is his parody of former SLA terrorist
and heiress Patty Hearst within Honey Whitlock's transformation.  His
screenplay has several fizzy ideas, but on the screen they play flat,
particularly the film's climax which is simply filmed anarchy.  To his
credit, Waters' film looks like the guerilla filmmaking he's portraying.
Melanie Griffith is more than a good sport here - she was meant to play this 
role and gives it her all.  Stephen Dorff is over the top as the maniacal 
Demented, with his punk hair style, rolling eyes and tattoos (all the 
Sprockets boast tattoos of cult directors such as Herschel Gordon Lewis and 
Werner Rainer Fassbinder).  None of the Sprockets particularly stand out, 
although Witt goes to town in her porn piece.  Former Waters' stars Mink Stole 
and Ricki Lake have cameos.
While it was initially exciting to see the 'old' John Waters style 
back on the screen, it looks like he should stick to what works for him
now.  "Cecil B. Demented" is the personification of the adage 'You can't
go home again.'

     There is something so petulant and defensive about the tone of CECIL
B. DEMENTED that it's almost enough to make you cry for John Waters. Once
upon a time, he _was_ underground cinema. He made the movies he wanted to
make, and damn the sensibilities of anyone else. But times have changed
since Waters' early '70s heyday. Independent film-making came into its
own, and while "mainstream" comedy has grown more gratuitously daring in
recent years, Waters has drifted to the ideological center with
campy-yet-tame movies like CRY-BABY, HAIRSPRAY and SERIAL MOM. In CECIL
B. DEMENTED, Waters seems engaged in a desperate attempt to be recognized
for his edge once again. He'd show us where his sympathies were; he'd give
it to mainstream Hollywood big time.
     This is what it has come to for the man who introduced coprophagy
into the contemporary cinema: crafting a toothless, uninspired satire of
Hollywood, and using Melanie Griffith to do it. Griffith stars as Honey
Whitlock, a raging bitch of an A-list Hollywood actress appearing at a
fund-raiser premiere in Baltimore for her latest mediocrity. At the event,
she's kidnapped by guerrilla director Cecil B. DeMented (Stephen Dorff),
who has big plans for his big star. Along with his cast and crew of
similarly dedicated underground cinema enthusiasts, DeMented plans to make
a film about a frustrated art theater owner declaring war on the
multiplexes and bloated studio films of America. It will be shot in actual
theaters and movie sets, recording actual acts of anti-Hollywood 
terrorism. And Honey Whitlock is going to be the reluctant leading lady.
     Subtlety has never exactly been John Waters' strongest suit as a
film-maker, so it may be unfair to expect anything different from CECIL. 
Nevertheless, it's wearying to sit through a satire that takes such broad,
trite shots at its target. Waters aims for guffaws from such predictable
subjects as the cost of theater concessions, PATCH ADAMS: THE DIRECTOR'S
CUT and unnecessary sequels, then gets even more insider by railing
against fines for film set transgressions. Even when it seems like he's
preparing to let loose with his gloriously bad taste -- a scene in a porn
theater where onanistic patrons appear on the verge of defending Cecil and
company from pursuers with a hail of bodily fluids -- Waters backs off to
something silly and subdued. CECIL's 88 minute, non-stop assault on the
obvious may not include a single honest belly laugh.
     And the sad part is, there are a couple of decent ideas floating
around here. Griffith's Honey isn't really a character -- Waters probably
hasn't written a real character in his life -- but the charge she gets out
of the underground cachet of working with Cecil could have made for some
sharp jabs at other big-time actors who work on low-budget projects. 
Waters also comes up with an insightful line when Cecil notes that there's
nowhere for renegade film-makers to go but to the extreme after Hollywood
has co-opted sex and violence. In neither case does Waters take the idea
anywhere interesting. Griffith's performance is high camp in the grand
Waters tradition, but there's nothing funny or clever about the way her
conversion to Cecil's way of thinking is handled. And for an ambush,
pseudo-snuff production, Cecil's film itself doesn't demonstrate nearly
enough creativity or outrage.
     The way Waters approaches his protagonist and his dream project
ultimately doom CECIL as much as its limp humor. It's certainly clear that
Waters disdains the vapid product shoveled into American theaters, a
sentiment in which he has plenty of company. But it also appears that he
has no concern for whether or not Cecil's film is going to be any good; 
to Waters, the simple act of fighting the movie establishment power is
enough to make him a hero. It may have been true 25 years ago that a film
could be exhilarating just because its creator was daring and thrifty. 
Today, it helps if the film itself is more than an exercise in 
self-indulgence. CECIL B. DEMENTED finds John Waters insisting that his
brand of underground film-making is still the way to go. The bitter irony
is that he's made something just as disposable as PATCH ADAMS: THE
DIRECTOR'S CUT.

Keywords: author=saravia
I am not sure what to make of John Waters at this point. The witty Baltimore 
trash director who opened the world's eyes with the fabulously disgusting 
"Pink Flamingos" has followed that hit with more lows than highs. For every 
"Hairspray" and "Serial Mom," there were travesties to cinematic decency such 
as "Cry-Baby" and "Pecker." "Cecil B. Demented" shows me a director who is 
sinking to such a low extreme that I found myself trying to come up for air 
repeatedly. 
Cecil B. Demented (Stephen Dorff) is a no-budget film director/cult leader 
who along with his crew, known as the "Sprocket Holes," kidnap a famous movie 
star, Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) and force her to star in their own 
demented production. Cecil's intent is to shoot a film titled "Raging Beauty" 
about outlaw filmmakers who bust in and out of multiplexes, production 
meetings and more multiplexes to proclaim their rant that Hollywood, 
basically, sucks! Their hostage, Honey with a peroxide hairdo, will help them 
fight their cause by threatening everyone with a gun and ranting their 
philosophies such as "Death to those who support mainstream cinema!"  
"The Sprocket Holes" are a motley crew of punkish, insufferably smug 
character types that include Cherish (Alicia Witt), an incest victim who is 
also a former porno star; a drug addict named Lyle (Adrienne Grenier) who 
consumes all substances and plays the leading man in Demented's film, and 
Rodney (Jack Noseworthy), the hair stylist, who hates being heterosexual. 
There is also a makeup artist, Raven (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a Satanic 
worshipper who adores Kenneth Anger and Aleister Crowley, and a butch female 
cinematographer and producer, and so on. None of these characters elicit much 
interest or inspiration. They come across as flat caricatures. 
In the end, that may be the problem with John Waters. His last excruciating 
film, "Pecker", was so flatly staged that it induced boredom more than 
anything else. There is no drive, no energy, no real sense of movement in 
this film either. You get the sense that Waters only filmed one take of every 
scene with no punch or irony. Of course, none of that would matter if the 
film was funny but it is decidely not. The fundamental question is: who is 
Waters really attacking in this film? It may seem like Hollywood but that is 
a moot point when you consider savagely funny satires such as "The Player", 
"Living in Oblivion" and "My Life's in Turnaround," to name but a few. Also 
consider how in the last few years, independent films have become almost as 
mainstream as Hollywood. Has Waters heard of Miramax, which is literally 
Hollywood in the East Coast, the same company that produced "The English 
Patient"? The term "indie" has been abused so often that the line between 
Hollywood and independent is very thin. And what company has produced Waters 
latest? Well, it is Artisan entertainment, the same company that puts its 
label on a new video edition of Schwarzeneger's "The Terminator"! 
"Cecil B. Demented" is simply not demented enough or savage enough to really 
attack its targets and so as satire, it fails miserably. The actors shout and 
rant but with little purpose or ingenuity. The film ends with a crowd forming 
around the drive-in showing of Honey's last Hollywood opus while Cecil and 
his demented group go around having sex with each other while the cops shoot 
at them. It may seem radical but I would call it desperate at best.
