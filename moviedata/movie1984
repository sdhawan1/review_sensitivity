John Travolta third movie role of 1997 saw him playing the part of an
underdog schmuck caught up in the high stakes game of news, media and
ratings. 
PLOT:
Recently fired employee Sam Baily returns to his ex-place of work, the
museum, to attempt to get his job back. When his ex-employer doesn't
cooperate, he takes matter into his own hands by holding her, and
several kids visiting the museum, hostage. A predatorial reporter named
Max Brakett is also held hostage by Baily, and attempts to weave his
sincere concerns into an extravagant news story to his benefit. 
CRITIQUE:
This film wasn't really as bad as it was just plain boring. The film
goes on for a little under two hours, with nothing new to add to the
dozens of hostage films that Hollywood has spewed out over the years.
Yes, it does attempt to show us how harmful the media can be in many
such situations, but then again, don't we hear about that crap on the
nightly news every other evening? The umpteen shots of a "stampede" of
reporters/cameramen leaping onto innocent victims of a news story also
got boring quick (we get the point, Costa...). I also remember this
film being marketed as a "suspense, but trust me when I tell you there
ain't much suspense here, kids. Nothing new was learned by JoBlo, and
nothing original was attempted by veteran director Costa-Gavras. A
rehash of a rehash of a rehash. If you really want to see a great
hostage picture, go out and rent DOG DAY AFTERNOON (8/10) starring a
young Alfonso Pacino, and get ready for some nacho-chewing fun!
John Travolta actually surprised me in this film, by delivering an
excellent rendition of an unemployed, dumb, nervous Joe Everyguy. Never
thought he could pull it off with his extreme popularity as a
personality, but he did. Hoffman didn't surprise me one bit in this
film, and seemed to be walking through his role as the roving reporter.
I did however notice the beautiful eyes of Mia Kirshner of EXOTICA
(6.5/10) fame. 'Tis to note that JoBlo once had a crush on Mia while
she attended his alma matter in Montreal, and even thought about
meeting her in a hallway one day, and asking her out for a coffee.
'Twas not to be.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who has already seen
any other hostage picture. Nothing in this movie will surprise or
impress you. Its title spurts the flow of unoriginality, and it's
downhill from there. If you're a big Travolta fan, or you dig the way
he sported his sideburns in this flick (admittedly, I also dug the
burns), then by all means, rent it with your friends, and count the
number of things that you've already seen in other, better movies. If
not, then rent the film I recommended earlier, or for a funnier, more
upbeat hostage film, go out and rent another "dumb guy taking people
hostage" film titled CADILLAC MAN, and starring the sporadically-funny
Robin Williams. But don't ever say that I never warned you about this
film.
Little Known Facts: 
Travolta has married fellow actress Kelly Preston (JERRY MAGUIRE
7.5/10) twice. Their first wedding on 5 September 1991, by a French
Scientologist minister, was declared illegal. The couple met during the
filming of THE EXPERTS. Their son Jett was conceived during a weekend
at Demi Moore and Bruce Willis' house.
Richard Gere practically owes his film career to Travolta. Travolta
turned down the leads for DAYS OF HEAVEN, AMERICAN GIGOLO and AN
OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, all of which subsequently went to Gere.
Dustin Hoffman was paid $17,000 to star in his breakthrough hit THE
GRADUATE (6/10), and stands 5"5.
Alan Alda's real name is Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo.

     There is a moment -- actually two -- when local television
reporter Max Brackett could have put an end to the hostage crisis that
ends up gripping the nation.  Sam Baily, the none too bright,
disgruntled employee has laid down his sawed-off shotgun.  As Sam turns
his back, Max has a brief opportunity to grab the weapon.  As anxiety
flashes across forehead, Max's eyes draw a bead on the shotgun, but his
body stays frozen.  His inaction guarantees the continuation of the
story of his career.
     Famous director Costa-Gavras has to date created a body of work
with an underlying theme of tension and terror.  From his Academy Award
nominated direction of Z to his more recent efforts including MISSING
and MUSIC BOX, his films have a hard-edge that leaves moviegoers
squirming uneasily in their seats.
     His most recent film, MAD CITY, represents a change of pace.
Although the hostage situation might sound like his previous films, it
isn't.  The script by Tom Matthews, based on a story by Eric Williams
and Matthews, stays firmly in the comedic range.  Partly a commentary
on media excesses and partly a black comedy, the script skirts a fine
line between the two, which could be considered its major weakness.
Had one or the other of them been more fully developed, it would have
been a better movie.  And in the latter case it would have been even
more like BROADCAST NEWS, the show it most closely resembles.  (Robert
Prosky plays roughly the same part as a newsroom executive in both
pictures.)
     John Travolta, an actor with an increasingly wide acting range,
plays Sam Baily.  With Sam's sad sack look, his pot belly, his rumpled
clothes and his confused demeanor, he has bad luck written all over
him.  After being laid off from his eight-dollar-an-hour job as a
museum guard, he comes back to discuss it with the museum's director,
played as prim and proper by a nattily dressed Blythe Danner.
     Blue-collar worker Sam, lacking confidence, makes a big mistake by
bringing along something to ensure that his ex-boss will pay him proper
attention.  With a gun and a bag of dynamite, his attempts at
reasonable discussion rapidly get out of hand.  His gun goes off
wounding his friend, the only other guard, and soon things go from bad
to worse -- but not for everyone.
     Max Brackett, played to a tee by a pensive Dustin Hoffman, has
lost his position at the networks and has been relegated to the
television minor leagues.  Sent by his boss, Lou Potts (Prosky), to do
a feel-good piece at the local museum, Max ends up being in the rest
room inside the museum when Sam finds himself with a wounded guard and
a dozen school children as accidental hostages.  The situation soon
escalates as Max manipulates the scene into a live story with himself
at the center of the storm.  Sounding like Rod Serling introducing a
"Twilight Zone" episode, Max intones his explanation of the crisis to
the rest of America.
     "A man has been shot; a line has been crossed," proclaims Max.
The movie comes back again and again to the issue of crossed lines with
the implication that the warring reporters cross it repeatedly in an
attempt to improve their poll numbers.  We flip back frequently to the
men behind the scenes at the network who check poll numbers on
everything from the newscasters' market share to Sam's popularity.
     Old timer Lou thinks the story has gotten out of hand.  "Jeez, I
sent you to cover a piece of fluff, and you come back with a hostage
situation," he complains to Max.  Like a man in a futile attempt to
battle a hurricane, Lou relinquishes control and lets the media feeding
frenzy begin.
     Chief Lemke's (Ted Levine) first question to Sam stumps him.  The
chief wants to know Sam's demands.  Max, in total control of the
situation, becomes Max's instant mentor.  Max advises against asking
for the only thing Sam wants, his old job back.  "You've got to ask for
a fast car, a Learjet or a Greyhound bus," Max tells him, otherwise
they will not take you seriously.
     When the story gets big, the network anchor, Kevin Hollander,
shows up to try to muscle in on Max's story.  "I'm who Americans trust
for their news," brags Kevin.  "You really shouldn't let a marketing
slogan go your head," retorts Max.  Alan Alda, who can do supercilious
with the best of them, plays Kevin.  To further complicate matters,
Kevin was the source of Max's downfall from the networks after Max
embarrassed him in a live feed at a previous crisis.  With Sam's poll
numbers headed for the moon, Kevin smells gold on earth, arguing that
"this guy's a poster child for the disenfranchised."
     The supporting cast is strong with the best being Max's young
assistant Lori, played by a perky Mia Kirshner.  When Kevin smiles at
her and she realizes this hostage crisis could launch her career, off
go her nerdy clothes and her hesitant manner.  She starts dressing like
an anchor and gets ready to walk over her dead mother's grave if need
be to get the story.
     Meanwhile, back at scene of the crime, Sam wiles away his time
playing Pied Piper with the kids as they raid the vending machines.
And when night falls, he tells them stories of the local Indian tribe.
     The defining moment in the show comes in a request from the big
boys at the network.  Could Max be so kind as to arrange for Sam to
surrender in prime time?  Oh, and could it be Thursday night since that
is when their ratings need the most help?
     MAD CITY runs 1:50.  It is rated PG-13 for a few violent scenes, a
couple of profanities and mature themes.  The show would be fine for
kids 10 and up although they probably need to be teenagers to be
interested in the movie.  I recommend the film to you and give it ***.

John Travolta was originally given the role of the reporter in MAD
CITY but fortunately he opted for being Sam, the bewildered security
guard at a local art museum.   The brash reporter, Max Brackett,
belongs to Dustin Hoffman who does a bang up job.
How many times have we witnessed a reporter shoving a microphone in
the face of an injured person being carried to an ambulance, asking
"How did you feel when you learned you lost your leg?"  How many
times have we seen a TV News crew on the front steps of the home of
bereaved parents, asking them, "What was your first reaction when
you learned your little daughter had been killed by a hit and run
driver?"   The point of MAD CITY, is that the story comes first, the
reporter wanting to milk the situation for as long as he can.  His
exposure on the small screen is the name of the game.
Max, formerly with a network, has been banished to a small station
at the behest of the big city anchor, Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda)
who did not like frequently being upstaged by Max.   To keep Max in
tow, the station's manager, Lou Potts, (Robert Prosky) assigns him
to cover a small story about finances at the local art museum.   He
assigns a young, pretty woman, Laurie (Mia Kirshner) to assist Max.
Best laid plans and all of that, while covering this non-story, Sam,
who had been fired by the art director Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner)
for drinking a bit too much at the museum's party, comes by to
demand his job back.   When Mrs. Banks says she will not rehire him,
the naive young man pulls a gun which he had no intention of ever
using but brought to the museum along with some sticks of dynamite
thinking to scare Mrs. Banks into giving him back his job.  He has
seen too much TV and has been led to believe that this is how you
get your job back.
In the museum are a couple of dozen children on a tour.  They are
now hostages. So far, that is enough to land SAM in a lot of trouble
but when the gun accidentally goes off and he shoots a fellow guard,
the stakes skyrocket.  Witnessing in an adjacent room is Max who
whispers on the connection to Laurie to alert the station that they
have a major hostage situation.   The bigger the tragedy, the better
the story; it is as simple as that.
MAD CITY then goes on to show Max discovered and coming out of
hiding, befriends Sam whom he advises.   But all the time, he really
does not want the drama to end too soon; not before he can again
become nationally known.   The big city anchor, Hollander, wants to
dump Max and turn this major event into his story.  He promises Max
that if the story is turned over to him, he will see that Max is
returned to big time.
Both Travolta and Hoffman are utterly believable.  Sam. bewildered,
not meaning to hurt anyone, just wanting his job back . . . and Max
orchestrating the proceedings to prolong the drama.
There is a delightful punch line delivered by Laurie to Max at the film's
end but you will have to hear it for yourselves.

Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   The situation is explosive.  A lone former employee has commandeered
   the Museum of Natural History.  Armed with a shotgun and explosives,
   he's wounded a security guard, and holds a few museum employees and
   a visiting class of young children hostage.  Holed up behind the
   relative safety of museum's security implementations, his sole
   liaison to the police and outside world is -- a ruthlessly ambitious,
   ethically bankrupt TV investigative reporter?  Uh-oh.
   Such is the scenario for Costa-Gavras' MAD CITY, which, through
   exposition of the increasingly-compromised ethics and outright
   dishonesty in modern television reporting, wants to be a searing
   indictment against the media, but ultimately produces little more
   than a singe.
   Chief in its problems is its lack of originality; this is simply a
   story which is too familiar to be told in such a straightforward
   manner.  Not only has the theme of media manipulation been addressed
   in similar fashion in several other films, but it's safe to conclude
   that by now the increasingly mistrusting and suspicious public is
   jaded enough to fully realize that the reporting it absorbs through
   print, radio, and television comes with a spin courtesy of the
   source which delivers it.  Tom Matthews' screenplay for MAD CITY
   tells us nothing new in this respect; it's preaching to the
   converted.
   Essentially a character study which focuses on the everchanging and
   curiously symbiotic relationship between gunman Sam Baily (John
   Travolta), a museum security guard recently laid off due to budgetary
   constraints who accidentally triggered the hostage siege when
   returning to attempt to plead his case to museum director Mrs.
   Banks (Blythe Danner), and reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman),
   a former network star desperate to regain his ace status after being
   demoted to local coverage, MAD CITY is relatively intimate and staid
   enough that it could function in a glossed-down form as a stage
   production.
   Sam is not a bad man: he's effectively a slow-witted simpleton
   played by Mr. Travolta as a lost puppy dog who haplessly bumbled his
   way into the volatile situation presented in MAD CITY.  The film
   takes great pains to assert his relative innocuousness -- his
   shooting of the other security guard (fine character actor Bill
   Nunn, curiously billed extremely low considering his substantial role
   in the film) was accidental -- by presenting him with a childlike
   mentality: he frolics with and wins over the captive schoolchildren,
   and perpetually turns to Max for guidance.  In this treatment, MAD
   CITY tries to be a bit too cute for its own good at times, which
   undermines the tension inherent in the situation.
   Of course, Max is happy to pull the strings behind this story and
   milk it for all it's worth -- this is his ticket back to the big
   time.  While the film is often simply blatantly unsubtle with its
   theme of media manipulation and sensationalism, as evident by a
   recurring thread in which Max tutors Sam on how to play up the
   situation in order to win public support (and of course, in his own
   self-interest, create high ratings), as well as a scene where Max
   edits and syncs interview footage until the final product corresponds
   with what he wants his subjects to say, one can almost relish his
   forthright, unapologetic lack of scruples.  While not disturbing as
   the film would seem to like, Max's aggressive naked ambition
   occasionally proves to be quite amusing: a particularly good moment
   in the film is a flashback sequent which depicts the cause for Max's
   demotion -- a moment of on-air grandstanding histrionics which
   humiliated network anchorman Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda).  However,
   in a move which seems arbitrarily artificial, MAD CITY ends up trying
   to play it both ways by having Max be as slimy and manipulative as
   the system the film cries out against, and then do a sudden
   about-face as the plot requires and grow a conscience; it rings
   patently false.
   Yet, although it's anticlimactic and often a little too heavy-handed,
   MAD CITY is always engaging and maintains interest.  Well shot by
   Patrick Bloosier and paced well, the film unfolds in a logical
   progression which is predictable but ultimately inevitable.
   It's helped by good performances from its cast.  MAD CITY is
   essentially a showcase for Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Travolta, who are
   solid in their respective roles.  I couldn't help but enjoy Mr.
   Hoffman's depiction of a character who discards objective reporting
   and puts a spin on his story with nonchalant efficiency, and Mr.
   Travolta, despite my best efforts to resist, is occasionally
   endearing through his character's bewilderment at the escalating
   situation in which he finds himself.  He does tend to substitute the
   use of slang for obliviousness in his character here, much as he did
   for a remarkably similar character in another performance -- in
   Desmond Nakano's WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, Mr. Travolta played a
   lower-class, uneducated working man whom, after being laid off from a
   menial job, took his employer hostage.  On the note of drawing
   parallels to previous work, the theme of chastising media
   manipulation isn't new to Mr. Hoffman, as can be witnessed in Stephen
   Frears' HERO (titled ACCIDENTAL HERO overseas).
   Mia Kirshner has a lot of spunk as the protege videographer Laurie
   who falls under Max's wing and learns the tricks of the trade
   all-too-well, eventually becoming seduced with the glamour of
   'making' the news.  Ms. Danner is good in a small role as the museum
   director and lends dignity to the part, although most of the time she
   just gets to stand around.  Mr. Alda is fine, although it's somewhat
   dubious to cast him as a network star anchorman -- he just doesn't
   have the gladhanding aura about him.  William Atherton rehashes a
   variation of his most famous role from as unscrupulous reporter
   Richard Thornberg in DIE HARD (which, in its own way, was even more
   effective and less self-righteous in its skewering of the media) --
   here, he plays a transparently-vacuous local anchorman.
   While MAD CITY thankfully avoided overt parallels to the O.J. Simpson
   media circus, and was wrapped production before any references to the
   Princess Diana incident could be made, the handling of the race card
   in the film struck me as far too heavy-handed, and the montages of
   T-shirts being sold outside the museum and folk singers strumming
   odes to Sam pushed the film too far into satire.  Granted, as can be
   seen from coverage outside the L.A. courtroom from 1996, it's not at
   all unbelievable, but the film would have been more effective and had
   a stronger impact had the emphasis on the carnival-like atmosphere
   which prevails along with media events been lessened.
   MAD CITY can be neatly encapsulated with one particular sequence, in
   which Max chastises Laurie for aiding the wounded museum guard --
   she can't film him and help him at the same time, and the former
   clearly takes precedent.  It's a heartless sentiment, but the
   sequence, like the film itself, is neither quite as disturbing or
   shocking as it's intended to be, because we already know the film's
   angle.  For a potentially potent story, MAD CITY, while eminently
   watchable, is curiously hollow.

MAD CITY (director: Costa-Gavras; screenwriter: Tom Matthews;
cinematographer: Patrick Bloosier; cast: John Travolta (Sam Baily),
Dustin Hoffman (Max Brackett), Alan Alda (Kevin Hollander), Mia Kirshner
(Laurie), Blythe Danner (Mrs. Banks), Robert Prosky (Lou Potts), 1997)
Costa-Gavras (Z/Missing) presents a film about the media exploiting the
news and expects us to be surprised to find out that all they care about
is the ratings. THE BIG CARNIVAL did this theme better, as long ago as
1951. Travolta, in Elvis sideburns, is the not-too-swift, common man
type, who is so upset with being fired as a museum guard that, at first,
he doesn't even tell his wife about it. Later, he comes back to talk
politely to his boss (Blythe) about getting his job back, but for some
inexplicable reason, he also comes with a gun and a bag full of
dynamite. Soon things go wrong and he is holding school children in the
museum as hostage, as he accidently shoots a black security guard.
Dustin, who is in the museum to do a fluff story for the small media
market tv station he now works for, after his fall from grace with
big-time national tv, takes this story and creates it to fit his needs
to get recognized again: to regain his position in the big media market.
The networks pick up this story as the public shows an interest in it,
and the cable-ready mindset of Dustin befriends the sadsack Travolta and
uses him to keep the story hot, with himself in the center of it.
The film is one-dimensional in scope, no one has room to grow. The
amusing relationship between Travolta and Dustin captures our attention
for most of the film, but nothing interesting happens. The only new
twist to the story, is that it isn't the anchor newsmen who are in
charge anymore, those who could smell a news story even in their sleep,
but it is the young corporate head yuppie types, interested only in the
bottom line and what the public opinion polls state, they are the ones
who now control what the public sees. The world of the media is shown to
be worse than ever, as this new breed of executives are not really news
people.
The actors tried too hard to make something out of nothing. In the end,
it is an old news story that we got-- but this time it is manipulated by
the movie director instead of the anchor man and the new corporate
executives.

Mad City is a potenially good film which is ruined because Hollywood formula
takes over it. Hoffman plays news reporter Max Brackett, who while doing a
report in a museum, gets caught in a unintentional hostage situation when
former employee Sam Baily (Travolta) bursts in with a shotgun demanding his
job back. Brackett, instead of panicking his head off, calmy turns this
situation into a massive media event. Although Travolta only wanted his job
back, he's now going to become a big American hero thanks to Brackett.
Mad City has the potential to be a great movie, but sadly it never even
seems to try to be a big movie. The easiest way to find the flaws is
comparing this movie to the section 'David Wilcocks 3 points to a OSCAR
winning movie.' Let's take a look....
1) "The Movie Must Have Great Performances" Well, Mad City is 50/50 here.
Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as a news reporter under pressure, he's calm,
collective and deviously manipulating. He's having much more fun here than
other films he made recently, such as Sphere (1998). Travolta, however,
while a good actor in other films, is just O.K here. Some scenes he does
well, and he's generally good fun, but he's overshadowed by Hoffman. Sadly,
Travolta just isn't powerful enough. Alan Alda also makes an appearence as a
rival news reporter, and he adds some life to the performances
2) "The Movie Must Have Great Direction." Costa-Gravas seems to be having
fun, and there's no faults with the directing. In some scenes he directs
well (such as Travoltas heart-warming plea to the nation to get his job
back) and gets emotion out of the audience. Mainly, though, it's suprinsgly
average, and disappointing.
3) "The Movie Must Have an Intelligent Story and Script." So close here. Mad
City's story is good, but the script never does it justice. It's so basic
and flawed, and it never tries to develop the characters. Brackett remains
as the reporter who wants to get the big story, Travolta remains the
confused guy who wants his job back. In short: they're flat, 2-D characters.
The dialogue itself can sound terrible, and it's always aimed at the dumbest
person in the audience. A shame.
In the end, Mad City is too flawed and too mediorce, and throughout the
whole film I just got the feeling this wan oppurtunity missed. Although it
has flashes of brilliance, Mad City falls into the trap of 'average.'

Cast: Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Blythe Danner, Mia Kirshner, Alan
Alda, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Ted Levine, Bill Nunn, Lucinda
Jenny
Director: Costa-Gavras
Producers: Arnold Koppelson and Anne Koppelson
Screenplay: Tom Matthews
There is something intensely annoying about a story, that has only two
possible outcomes of which neither is satisfying.
Scenario 1:
An ex-security guard of a state museum (John Travolta) confronts his
boss with shotgun and explosives, in a desperate attempt to get his job
back. The boss (Blythe Danner) is a bit of a female tight arse, but hey,
if I were threatened with a pistol in my face, I wouldn't give you your
job back no matter how tight my arse. I mean I would initially say yes,
but sack you later.
Scenario 2:
During the confrontation, he accidentally shoots his buddy (Bill Nunn),
the other museum security officer in the stomach. This is the part where
the quick fix I'm sorry', doesn't work anymore.
Scenario 3:
He takes a group of children, a teacher and reporter (Dustin Hoffman)
hostage. This is the part where you've just lost all rational thinking,
the media starts portraying you as a lunatic and you get placed on top
of the police hit list all at once.
>From here on, there can only be two possible outcomes for the Travolta
character  To Jail' or To Death'. Knowing how Hollywood scripts work,
the To Jail' option is not very popular because audiences normally
don't like their hero/antiheroes to end up in jail. Jail is for bad guys
and the Travolta character isn't bad enough to end up there. So that
leaves us with the other option of To Death', which is cliché, but safe
enough to end a silly situation which couldn't have gone any other way.
John Travolta shows us how desperate a family man can get, if he is
unable to find work to support his family. Looking in the Classifieds
for a job would have been a better option, but that would be a different
story. Dustin Hoffman, the reporter, just mumbles his way through the
movie, trying to draw sympathy for the Travolta character, and is lucky
not get blown away for his efforts.
An overall, unnecessary tragedy and waste of human life.

   To paraphrase Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in the beginning
there are ideals.  Society interferes, and scruples are
corrupted.  As Costa-Gavras might have expressed this
philosophy is his latest melodrama, "Mad City": When we get
started in our professions, we're ready to change the world, to
make it a better place.  We become callused and begin to
look out only for Number One.  The character in "Mad City"
who best illustrates this is Mia Kirshner, in the role of Laurie,
an enthusiastic intern with a local California TV station. 
Laurie, who is bright, spirited, and very young, is in love with
her job as a budding broadcast journalist and more than
willing to attach herself to a mentor she naively believes to
share her interest in the Pursuit of Truth.  In short order she
becomes disillusioned with the possibilities of her medium
while at the same time develops the hard shell of a woman
who knows what she really wants: to zoom up the career
ladder and carve out a niche for herself in a most lucrative
profession.
   Costa-Gavras, a director whose sympathies have always
been firmly on the left of the political spectrum, jolted the film
world in 1970 with his third film, "Z," a stunning indictment of
the military junta which was at that time ruling his native
Greece.  At that time Costa-Gavras seemed to be believe he
was standing at the historical moment in which movies
themselves could transform history.  Ironically enough, the
famed director, born Konstantinos Gavras in 1933, seems to
have turned cynical himself, no longer believing that his
products could be much more than entertainment, however
thrilling.  With "Mad City" he continues the downhill move
signified by such ordinary diversions as "Hannah K.,"
"Betrayed," and "The Music Box."  "Mad City," an indictment
of the TV news industry, has its moments, but because Dustin
Hoffman and John Travolta do not themselves seem engaged
by their activities and because the action of the film often
seems like a photographed play taking place largely within the
confines of a museum, the film, while believable, fails to
captivate.  What's more, Costa-Gavras does not even educate
us about the depravity of the establishment he debunks. 
Whether we're news junkies or casual followers of the blow-
dried anchors who nightly illuminate our TV screens, we
digest nothing more than what we already know.
   The tale centers on Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman), a sharp
investigative reporter who has been demoted to backwater
stories because at one time he publicly ridiculed anchorman
Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda).  (A flashback midway into the
movie portrays Hollander as an egotistical seeker of high
ratings who grills reporter Brackett very specifically about the
content of body parts which have flown hither and thither after
a airline accident.)  When Brackett is assigned to interview
Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner), the director of a museum which
has fallen on difficult financial times, he stumbles upon an
incident involving a former security guard, Sam Baily (John
Travolta), who has been laid off from his job and who,
entering the museum with a shotgun, compels its director to
listen to his grievances.  What seems at first an interesting,
though unexceptional event, turns into a national
phenomenon involving the rapt attention of the American
public.  
   Seeking to exploit the protests of the previously honest and
intellectually vacant security guard, Brackett coaxes his
station to give him a live, nationwide hookup, which allows
him to present the human side of the unfortunate gunman. 
Every technique of the TV industry is marshalled, including
reportage of polls--which show that a majority of viewers have
become quite sympathetic to the felon.  Rejoicing in his
newly-found fame as a TV journalist, Brackett becomes 
Baily's adviser, insisting that Baily make substantial demands
on the police forces which have gathered outside the museum
and becoming, in effect, a strong segment of the story.  As
hawkers gather to sell souvenir T-shirts with Sam's picture,
clashes develop between the FBI and the local police chief
and between anchorman Hollander and reporter Brackett for
ownership of the story.  Meanwhile Laurie tracks down the
felon's mother to broadcast an interview largely sympathetic
to Sam, who has by now become the taker of hostages,
largely children, and who has accidentally shot the man with
whom he had worked.
   "Mad City" fits in with several other movies which have
taken their pleasure in exposing the debauched underside of
American institutions.  "Critical Care," which opened at about
the same time as "Mad City," satirizes the hospital industry,
which is far more concerned about the financial health of its
patients than about their well-being.  Just recently, "Devil's
Advocate" unfolded a scenario in which a brilliant lawyer
begins to question the ethics of defending people whom he
knows are felons.  Years back, "The Hospital" turned a
serious situation into Marx-Brothers comedy while "Network"
exposed the TV industry's willingness to do anything to
increase ratings.  "The Big Carnival," Billy Wilder's 1951 film
about an embittered reporter who seeks the brass ring by
exploiting a human interest story, was a more biting story than
"Mad City," one which featured superior acting by Kirk
Douglas and Jan Sterling.  Perhaps the passage of time has
made us all so cynical about the banalities of doctors,
lawyers, politicians and journalists that "Mad City"--which
offers nothing fresh--is simply unable to shake us up.  Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 114 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten

Der gekьndigte Museumswдrter Sam Baily (John Travolta), dringt zur seiner
ehemaligen Arbeitsstelle mit einer Waffe vor und will sich mit der
Direktorin unterhalten. Als die jedoch wьtend wird, feuert Baily einen
Schuя ab, verletzt ohne Absicht seinen Kollegen und nimmt die momentan
anwesende Schulklasse als Geiseln. Zufдllig ist auch Max Brackett, ein
ehemaliger Starreporter, der seit zwei Jahren in der Provinz arbeitet,
anwesend und wittert seine Chance fьr ein Comeback. Schon bald steht er im
Rampenlicht der zahlreichen Journalisten, die angereist sind, um Bailys
Geschichte zu hцren. Brackett will den leichtglдubigen und naiven Wдchter
als Opfer darstellen, als Vertreter der Arbeiterklasse, der sich endlich
einmal Gehцr verschaffen will. Doch sein Erzfeind Kevin Hollander, wegen
dem er zuvor in eine Kleinstadt verbannt worden war, macht sich ebenfalls
daran, das Thema zu verarbeiten, allerdings will er nicht so wohlwollend
mit Sam umgehen...
Daя Reporter keine Engel sind, ist eigentlich klar. Und wenn sie dazu noch
aus den USA kommen, trifft die Bezeichnung "Bestie" wohl viel mehr zu.
Genau dieses Bild hat "Mad City" vor Augen, wenn der Film mit seiner
Darbietung einer eigentlich ungewollten Entfьhrungsgeschichte beginnt. Doch
Medienkritik betreibt Costa-Gavras Film eigentlich nicht primдr, dazu ist
er viel zu gutmьtig. Aber seine beiden Hauptdarsteller geben dem
handlungsmдяig gesehen konventionellen Drama das gewisse Etwas. John
Travolta glдnzt als verzweifelter Wachmann Sam Baily, gekonnt stellt er den
miяverstandenen und herzensguten Naivling dar, ohne in pathetisches Gehabe
zu verfallen. Wenn er den Kindern im Museum die Geschichte vom alten
Indianer erzдhlt, oder wenn er mit gerцteten Augen in die Kamera blickt und
beim Publikum um Verstдndnis fьr seine Tat bittet, dann merkt man, daя hier
mit Leib und Seele gespielt wurde, und daя Glaubwьrdigkeit in einem
Hollywood-Film doch ansatzweise mцglich ist. Mit fortschreitender Laufzeit
wandelt sich Baily dann immer mehr zum seelischen Wrack, das an alten
Versprechungen festklammert und die Realitдt nicht wahrhaben will, und auch
hier gelingt es Travolta spielend, den Zuschauer fьr seine Verдnderung
einzuspannen. Dustin Hoffman ьberzeugt ebenfalls als abgestempelter
Ex-Profi, selbst wenn er in vielen Szenen auf sein zerfurchtes Gesicht und
sein verschmitztes Lдcheln baut. Hoffmann ist einer der wenigen
Schauspieler, die man sich in fast allen Rollen vorstellen kann, in "Mad
City" verbucht er als gerissener, aber mit der Zeit menschlicher gewordener
Journalist alle Sympathien fьr sich. Und wenn Sam und Max zusammen auf der
Treppe sitzen, beide verschaukelt von einem verlockenden, aber ungemein
gefдhrlichen Mediensystem, erhдlt Costa-Gavras Film eine erstaunliche
Ehrlichkeit, die man sich ьber die restlichen 110 Minuten auch gewьnscht
hдtte. Denn wenn Dustin Hoffman in einer fabelhaften Endszene, in der sich
die Mikrofone wie geifernde Spinnenarme ьber ihn ranken, die Gesamtaussage
von "Mad City" auf den Punkt bringt, wird jeder aufgeklдrte Zuschauer das
bestдtigen kцnnen, aber mit dem Gewissen, es auch vorher schon verstanden
zu haben...

Losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing. Reacting to such a personal
setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare. While
we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when
they don't seem to grasp our point of view, actually threatening them with one
is usually something we avoid. This isn't the case with Sam Baily - John
Travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in MAD CITY.
"I don't think people listen to guys like me," Sam laments during an exclusive
interview from behind the walls of a museum. Just a few days ago, Sam was a
guard at this same museum, but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his
security position, Sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision. In an
effort to get his ex-boss, museum director Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner), to
"just listen", he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded
shotgun, taking the uncooperative Banks and a group of school children
hostage.
Sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job, his paycheck, his
benefits, etc., his wife and two children won't be provided for. He's not a
lunatic or a hot-tempered madman, he's somewhat like a child - panicky,
compulsive, and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped
any by the fact that Banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go.
Overall, he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view
the line we'd deem "far enough" as the starting mark of some crazy race.
Meanwhile, television reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman) is also on the
scene. Covering a "fluff" story for the evening news concerning the museum
cutbacks, Max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking
news story he ever could've hoped for. Having been demoted from network
newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting, Max is anxious to turn this into
his, and only his, story.
Max immediately bonds with Sam. Max even coaches Sam thru hostage negotiations
and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone. At first,
Max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole
pride factor, but as he gets to know Sam more personally, he begins to
sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him. The media,
however, is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as
often as a diesel truck moving downhill. The accidental shooting of ex-co-
worker Cliff (Bill Nunn), a black security guard, becomes one of the main
factors in the controversy over Sam's honest ambitions.
Also involved in this film are Robert Prosky as Lou Potts, head of the news
department of the station Max falls directly under, and Alan Alda as the
nationally famed reporter Kevin Hollander, who uses his network power to try
and outshine Max. Alda and Prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like
gloves on their acting abilities. Then there is Mia Kirshner, who plays the
young TV station intern Laurie. She falls under Max's wings only to become a
student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting. Kirshner's
credits are relatively small for now, including roles in films like EXOTICA
and the forgettable sequel to THE CROW. Still, Kirshner's character
transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and
kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles. I wouldn't mind seeing her in some more
prevalent parts, where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully
onscreen.
While the viewpoint of the media as a greedy, self-righteous monster has
indeed been tackled before, MAD CITY provides a solid two hours of
enjoyability. Hoffman and Travolta are both excellent actors, and seeing them
together is a real treat. They both do a great job at smoothly and naturally
becoming their characters, and they provide enough chemistry for us to
genuinely care for both. There is quite a bit of humor in this film, and
without it, it could've fallen into a drab, cliched social statement more
likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause. This isn't a flick
that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart, but it will lightly
touch both, making for a recommendable movie. If for nothing more than the
opportunity to watch both Hoffman and Travolta at the same time, I urge you to
check this one out.

     The computerized, synthesized and homogenized society we've built for
ourselves in the 90's takes its toll on one man in 'Mad City'.  Director
Costa-Gavras ('Z', 'Missing', 'Betrayed', 'Music Box') presents a
psychological, sympathetic and sometimes compelling portrait of a man whose
fight for simplistic values forces a nightmarish confrontation in a small
California town.
     John Travolta plays a security guard who loses his job due to economic
cutbacks at a museum where he was formerly employed and he walks in one
afternoon to ask the 
museum's curator for his job back.  He is dismissed quickly as a complainer
and is made to feel like a loser when he snaps.  He produces a shotgun and
fires off a round in anger.  While this is happening, a local television
reporter (Dustin Hoffman) happens to be on the scene and witnesses the
unfolding events from a crack in the men's room door at the museum.  To
further complicate matters, the shot Travolta fired off in anger ends up
wounding a fellow security guard who was friends with Travolta and the shot
was accidental and a group of children and their teacher are enjoying a
field trip at the time of the siege and needless to say, they're all held
hostage.  Hoffman is able to use the pay phone inside the men's room and
gets hooked up with his station to go live as the story is breaking.  He is
discovered by Travolta and becomes part of the hostage crisis.  The local
police, FBI and every media outlet in the area scramble for spot a the scene.
     For a film set basically in one location for almost two hours, 'Mad
City' is a well crafted but yet low-key story involving a man's loss of
dignity and the measures he will go to to get it back.  The film harnesses
its emotions to breed a look totally convincing and it refuses to become
pretentious while examining media ethics at the same time.  Involved in the
ensuing mayhem is a big time commercial anchorman from NYC (Alan Alda) who
used to be a colleague of Hoffman's and co-worker but the two of them had a
falling out when Hoffman embarrassed him during live coverage of a plane
crash back in New York.  Alda flies to California in an attempt to boost his
career by getting inside facts on the breaking story as it continues to unfold. 
     'Mad City' drags at certain points and Dustin Hoffman is upstaged by
the nerve ending performance turned in by John Travolta.  Hoffman's
performance is not to be 
misunderstood.  He is in a desperate situation and remains calm and does a
good job of it.  It's just that Travolta's character is better written.  One
interesting piece of information to pass along revolves around the fact that
in the original casting of this film, Hoffman was slated to be the hostage
taker and Travolta the reporter but things changed and for the better I
might add as the characterizations are more believable in this dramatic
grandstand.

Director Costa-Gavras was born in Greece. His correct name is Konstatinos
(Constantine), or Kostas for short, Gavras ("gah-VRASS). It was hyphenated
by the French.
Few people today are aware that the Cold War began right at the end of
World War II, in Greece, as a civil war between Communist partisans and the
Royalist regime.
Gavras's father was a modest government employee. He was suspected of
leftist affiliations and suffered for it. The discrimination extended to
the young Costas. Denied rights like a driving permit or entrance to Athens
University, he went to Paris at age 16 or 17, studied literature at the
Sorbonne, later film-making, then became assistant director to several
major directors. His first film, a crime thriller, was a hit. In 1968,
Gavras became a French citizen, made his third film, the multi-prized "Z"
that was hailed as the first big, French political picture. There followed
more, impressive political thrillers.
Gavras was on to a fresh film formula. He was the first to combine the
vigorous, American style with European political sensibility. The movies
were major successes, won great awards. All were taken from real events,
each antagonized a different political regimes. "Z," on the assassination
of a leftist Greek leader by the forces of the right, riled the military
junta that was to rule Greece for seven years - even though the murder had
preceded the colonels' putsch."The Confession" dealt with political
kangaroo trials within Communist Czechoslovakia. It infuriated much of the
Left. "State of Siege" set in Uruguay (but filmed in democratic Chile just
before Allende's fall) took on the CIA and political torture. It displeased
many in the USA. "Special Section"'s denouncing of French tribunals under
the German Occupation, and French judges as toadying collaborators, made
many French legal professionals see red.
Then began Gavras's US-period. "Missing"  (Cannes festival top prize) dealt
with mass slaughter, the killing of a young American in Pinochet's Chile,
and the inanity of State Department representatives. "Hanna  K" attempted a
"rapprochement" between Arabs and Jews, was accused of being
pro-Palestinian. It had a  short life in American theaters. The flawed but
gripping "Betrayed" denounced white supremacists was followed by "Music
Box," on wartime criminals harbored in the USA.
The better Gavras films are fascinating. The man has no fixed or partisan
ideology, yet the same strain runs through his movies: attacking the abuse
of power of any sort. In "Mad City," that principle still applies, since
the media, led by television, wield amazing influence and often abuse it
for sensationalism, ratings and ego-boosting.
The story is one of headlines. Max Brackett (Hoffman) a star investigative
TV reporter for the CTN network, had rubbed the wrong way the powerful,
self-serving and jealous CTN star anchor Hollander (Alda), and had been
exiled to an affiliate in a small California city. Max, chafing at the bit
because his station's manager will not allow him to do big exposes without
proofs, is sent to report on a local museum, now in financial straits. This
turns into manna from Heaven for sensation-seeking Max. Now is his chance
for a scoop that will put him back on top.
As he interviews museum director Mrs. Banks (Danner), the haughty scion of
the founders, there bursts in Sam Baily (Travolta). He is a poor
blue-collar slob who was dismissed as a guard. He is armed with a rifle and
dynamite, not intending to use them, but for getting Mrs. Banks' attention
and plead  for reinstatement. The man is clearly slow-witted and, at least
temporarily, highly deranged.
Accidentally, Sam discharges his gun and hits the remaining guard,
Williams, who is black and was Sam's buddy. Totally confused and remorseful
by events that got out of hand,  Sam keeps hostage a bunch of visiting
school kids, their teacher and Mrs. Banks. He treats them with
friendliness. The crisis grows instantly into a media-circus with crowds,
reporters, cops (and a headline-seeking police chief), firemen, flashing
lights, street vendors...
Connoisseurs realize that "Mad City"'s writers knew Billy Wilder's "The Big
Carnival," (1951), originally titled "Ace in the Hole." Kirk Douglas played
an opportunistic big-city reporter who sees his chance at winning fame (the
Ace) by exploiting cynically a man in New Mexico buried by a cave-in (in a
Hole). The event becomes a media circus (the Carnival).  Is it an accident
that Dustin Hoffman is named Max Brackett? Wilder's longtime writer was
Charles Brackett.
Other inspirations include "The Front Page" (remade as "His Girl Friday);
"Dog Day Afternoon" where a robbery by Dustin Hoffman blows out of
proportions; and various exposes of the TV business (e.g."Network").
The madness continues in broad yet believable lines. Press people, a la
paparazzi, pursue Williams to his hospital bed or film him with from a
scaffolding outside his window. A black reporter insinuates to Mrs.Williams
that racism was involved. A bystander harangues the crowd on Waco, Ruby
Ridge, and people (read "whites") losing jobs through racial quotas.
We've come a long way since "Z," where the press actually helped the Good
Guys. Yet traces of decency remain. Max's initial reaction is only to
exploit the incident, but soon he becomes the advisor-mentor of helpless
Sam. He coaches, then interviews him on camera, trying to show the good,
human side of the man. He also becomes his intermediary and, yes, his
friend, as he walks a tightrope between getting the story and doing the
best he can for Sam.
Played superbly and coolly by Hoffman, he is a canny, intelligent pro,
knows the trade by heart, even anticipates the media's and the FBI's moves.
Caught between several fires, he maneuvers very well --until, that is,
slimy anchor Hollander shows up to steal the show. The two men's
relationship and power struggles are convincingly depicted.
Inevitably, Gavras makes the movie "a l'americaine," with strokes
bolder--and slicker perhaps--than in an European psychological thriller.
This does not hurt, although Travolta is so well in control of his crazed
sad sack characterization that it gets theatrical at times. The technical
credits are very good.  Photography is by Frenchman Patrick Blossier
("Vagabond," "Betrayed," "Music Box"). Editing is by Frenchwoman Francoise
Bonnot who has often worked brilliantly with Gavras, starting with "Z" for
which she received an Oscar. She also won the UK's BAFTA Award.
Then there's the character of Laurie (Kirshner), a pretty, young TV intern,
who was delighted to be assigned to Max for the museum reportage. She
looked at him so adoringly that to avoid entanglements he quipped "I'm
gay." But soon starry-eyed Laurie symbolizes the future of TV. When
Hollander appears, the sweet young thing ceases to be Max's Girl Friday and
switches camps. By implication she would do anything to climb the ladder.
There are no fealties in the business.

     MAD CITY is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed 
on the long track from premise to realization.  The semi-serious film, 
which stars high-profile actors Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta, and is 
directed by Costa-Gavras (BETRAYED), becomes the latest in the recent 
flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in 
broadcast journalism.  It's all ratings and entertainment value, not 
integrity!  Unlike some of the more worthy contenders, MAD CITY fails to 
bring anything new to the table.  Every aspect of this movie has been 
presented before in a better film with a more involving setup.  If 
you've seen NETWORK, TO DIE FOR, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO, and especially 
Billy Wilder's 1951 biting satire, THE BIG CARNIVAL (aka ACE IN THE 
HOLE), MAD CITY will seem like a tired retread.  
     The absence of originality and inspiration isn't MAD CITY's only 
problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety.  The film's 
goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that 
nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type:  the 
empty-headed local news personality, the arrogant network anchor, the 
innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune, and the old-
fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated.  
Even John Travolta's Sam Baily isn't all that interesting -- he's 
basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him.  Only Max 
Brackett (Hoffman), an ambitious TV reporter covering the story from the 
inside, is worth a second look.
     "The story" is a hostage situation at the local Museum of Natural 
History.  Sam, an out of work security guard, returns to the site of his 
dismissal to plead with his former boss (Blythe Danner) to get his job 
back.  When she refuses to hear his case, he pulls out a gun and starts 
shooting.  In the process, he accidentally hits his best friend, Cliff 
(Bill Nunn), the museum's only remaining security guard.  Sam, suddenly 
in over his head and unsure what to do, locks up the building and takes 
everyone inside hostage -- including a class of young children there on 
a school trip.  Unbeknownst to Sam, Max is on hand, hiding out in the 
mens' room.  It isn't long before Max is on the air with an exclusive, 
and, after Sam discovers him, his role changes from covering the 
situation to manipulating it by offering Sam advice how to solidify his 
position and do damage control.
     The centerpiece of MAD CITY is obviously the interaction between 
Sam and Max, as the former tries to figure a way out of the mess he has 
gotten himself into and the latter tries to exploit the situation.  Max 
has no compunction about crossing over the blurred line that divides 
reporting a story from becoming part of it, while Sam doesn't understand 
the dynamics of the situation -- until, that is, he looks out a window 
and sees the throng of reporters and law enforcement officials that has 
gathered around the museum.  Sadly, however, while the relationship 
between Sam and Max starts out interesting, it rapidly turns routine as 
Max gets an attack of conscience.  MAD CITY says everything it wants to 
say in its first forty-five minutes.  After that, it spins its wheels 
for over an hour, waiting for the inevitable conclusion.  
     Despite Costa-Gavras' best manipulative efforts, Sam never captures 
our sympathy.  The intent is for us to identify with him as a victim at 
the end of his tether (sort of like Michael Douglas in FALLING DOWN), 
but he comes across as someone who's so stupid that he deserves what he 
gets.  Worse still, he's a static personality with no dramatic arc.  
He's the same at the end as at the beginning, and it's difficult for an 
audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth.  Travolta 
does an adequate job in this role, but he doesn't have a character of 
substance to work with.  
     Hoffman, who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic 
Bernstein in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, is excellent as Max, MAD CITY's 
dubious moral compass.  But, although Hoffman gives Max flair, there's 
little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script.  
None of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible 
exception of Alan Alda, who does a credible imitation of a snake in the 
grass.  His character, Kevin Hollander, "the man America trusts for 
news" is so self-serving that he makes Max look like an ethical pillar.
     In his examination of the media feeding frenzy, Costa-Gavras throws 
in everything but the kitchen sink.  There are tabloid reporters who 
manufacture questionable witnesses and harass a man lying in a hospital.  
There are "straight" reporters who edit interviews to reflect the angle 
they're looking for.  There are fringe elements of the press who play up 
the racial card (the man Sam shot is black).  There are network 
executives who are only concerned about ratings.  There are police who 
won't move until public opinion is on their side.  MAD CITY's overall 
picture of the media is decidedly unflattering. 
     The movie is also awash in subplots, none of which amount to much.  
In fact, they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two 
hour length.  For a film that covers so much material, MAD CITY seems 
surprisingly drawn out, but the reason is that it fails to do much of 
anything well.  The satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective.  
Watching MAD CITY, I felt much the same way that I did 5 years ago while 
sitting through Hoffman's HERO -- great idea, poor execution.  MAD CITY 
doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never 
gels into a compelling story.

MAD CITY (Warner Brothers)
Directed by Costa-Gavras
 The feeding frenzy for tidbits about breaking news stories among TV
reporters has become so absurd in recent years that it hardly needs to be
satirized: Just turn on CNN or MSNBC the next time there's a revelation
about the car crash that killed Princess Diana and count how many different
ways they can present the same piece of information. Certainly no media
figures will be stung by the puffball satire "Mad City," which centers
around the circus that develops around a hostage situation in the town of
Madeline, California; though writers Tom Matthews and Eric Williams seem
anxious to take the media to task for their excesses, their screenplay is
more preachy than it is astringent.
 The weak material is unenthusiastically played by Dustin Hoffman
(unimaginative and off-putting as a reporter anxious to recapture his
glamor) and downright badly handled by John Travolta as the laid-off museum
security guard whose attempt to get his job back sets the story in motion.
Trying to put himself in the shoes of a none-too-bright working-class guy,
Travolta often looks like he's auditioning for the part of Lennie in the
next production of "Of Mice and Men." His rambling monologues about his
dreams and disappointments are underscored by music that sounds like it was
lifted from a "Waltons" episode, perhaps in a  futile attempt to make this
caricature seem human.
 "If we do not learn from the past, we are destined to repeat it," notes
museum curator Blythe Danner early on in the film. She might have added "or
at least remake it," since "Mad City" is obviously striving for a "Dog Day
Afternoon"-type atmosphere of delightful/disturbing chaos. But the film
fails as both black-comedy and as slice-of-life drama, and director
Costa-Gavras' attempt at a potent finale is embarassingly heavy-handed: "Mad
City" is a movie straight outta Dullsville.

     In Costa-Gavras' new drama MAD CITY, reporter Max Brackett (Dustin
Hoffman) stumbles onto the story of a lifetime exactly when his career
needs it most -- and his soul needs it least.  Once a network news star,
Brackett has been serving time in the journalistic gulag of Madeline,
California since insulting anchorman Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda) on the
air.  While doing a puff piece at a local museum, Brackett finds himself
staring at his return ticket to the big time when laid-off security guard
Sam Baily (John Travolta) storms the place with a gun to demand his job
back, then inadvertently shoots another guard and ends up taking a group
of school children hostage.  Sam wants nothing more than to get out alive;
Brackett sees a chance to guide the story by becoming ringmaster of the
ensuing media circus as Sam's mouthpiece and de facto press secretary.
     Twenty years ago, a film like MAD CITY would have been a provocative
and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to
feed our blood-lust.  In fact, it was...it was called NETWORK.  Paddy
Chayefsky's brilliant script and Peter Finch's mesmerizing final
performance as unraveling anchorman Howard Beale made NETWORK a classic of
dark satire, spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit
of ratings.  It was just outrageous enough to be entertaining, and just
plausible enough to be alarming.
     MAD CITY arrives in a different era.  The notion that televison news
isn't just about the news...well, it just isn't news.  It never manages to
arouse much more than nods of recognition, because the images and
situations are familiar to the point of cliche:  Alda's self-important
anchorman, the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined
agenda, the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy.  As an ethics
lesson, it's strident but ineffective, preaching to a nation of converts
about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct.
     It's fortunate, then, that MAD CITY does a solid job of giving its
subject a human face.  That face doesn't belong to Dustin Hoffman, though
Brackett is the story's central character.  Watching his developing
crisis of conscience -- and similarly the conversion of Brackett's naive
assistant (Mia Kirshner) into a cutthroat reporter -- becomes a chore as
the script slogs toward the inevitable.  No, it is John Travolta who
creates the most vivid portrait in MAD CITY as a man overwhelmed by
circumstances before he has any idea what they are.  Playing simple
challenges any actor, yet Travolta plays simple with a disarming
effectiveness.  His trust that Brackett will act in his best interest is
wonderfully misguided; his incredulous expressions as Brackett takes over
an interview with Larry King capture the realization that the media's best
interests are always their own.  Sam Baily acts as a stand-in for everyone
who sees the media going berzerk over things they barely comprehend.
     The relationship moments between Baily and Brackett are among the
strongest in MAD CITY, though it also provides a few chuckles as the
public sympathies sway in the breeze.  Like most "message" films, however,
it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message.  MAD CITY's
primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character
developments, of the plot progression, of the scolding tone the film takes
towards its targets.  It reaches an audience which doesn't find
sensationalism disturbing, but it delivers its story as though no one else
had told it before.  That's two places NETWORK was prescient:  telling the
story of media gone mad, and anticipating viewers who would come to find
the madness tolerable.

Warner Bros. / 1:52 / 1997 / PG-13 (language, muted violence)
Cast: Dustin Hoffman; John Travolta; Alan Alda; Mia Kirshner; Blythe Danner; 
Ted Levine; Robert Prosky 
Director: Costa-Gavras 
Screenplay: Tom Matthews 
When it comes to depicting the effects of mass media, "Mad City" sure isn't 
pretty. This dull dramatic satire is notable for bagging a pair of solid 
actors -- Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta -- for its leads, but shortchanges 
itself by servicing them with a script about as stable as a mouthful of Pop 
Rocks with a carbonated chaser. As a result, "Mad City" is watchable, but 
never quite as involving or compelling as it strains to be. 
Hoffman plays Max Brackett, an investigative journalist regulated to small 
town-reporting in California after a live TV outburst sets him back with his 
superiors. Along with tagalong intern Laurie ("The Crow: City of Angels"' 
wooden Mia Kirshner), he is assigned to visit the Museum of Natural History 
and get a brief interview with its owner (Blythe Danner, eventually relegated 
to pacing the background but otherwise good). Afterwards, while Max is using a 
urinal -- still wired (thank goodness for plot coincidence!) -- and Laurie is 
waiting outside, fired security guard Sam Baily (Travolta) shows up with a bag 
of TNT and a gun, hoping to talk some sense into his former employer. 
Sam's timing is awful -- there's a group of wily schoolkids touring the 
exhibits -- and the stakes are raised when an accidentally-discharged bullet 
hits someone outside the museum's now-locked interior. But Max, secretly on 
the phone with his television station and reporting in voice-over, sees the 
potentially dangerous situation as both an enormous ratings-grabber and a 
chance for him to reclaim former career glory. Once discovered by an 
increasingly-weary and confused Sam -- and angered police, parents and 
citizens have surrounded the building -- Max manipulates him into a standoff 
with the authorities and arranges for live TV coverage as it ensues. 
Crafting solid characters seems to be a problem for first-time screenwriter 
Tom Matthews, as neither of these two leads have what it takes to keep us 
interested. Sam Baily would have hit home harder had Matthews taken some time 
to fully develop the guy. It's hinted at, but never explained, that Sam has a 
darker side than we are made privy to (there might have been a just reason for 
his dismissal), so, basically, he has been sanitized in order to make him 
tragic -- what we see and what we (briefly) hear contradict each other. 
Moreover, Sam's such a likeable cad that we know he's never going to snap and 
harm any of his prisoners; doing this keeps director Costa-Gavras from any 
child-in-jeopardy exploitation, but it also results in a huge lack of tension 
-- this has got to be one of the most laid-back hostage situations ever. Max 
Brackett, on the other hand, starts off interesting as the movie sets him up 
with numerous reprehensible traits. It becomes all too clear too fast, 
however, that they're only established so he can have a change of heart by the 
movie's end. From then on, everything plays out as expected, right down to a 
too-fake Larry King interview with Sam and Max and a totally contrived final 
scene that's supposed to illustrate (I think) how the media can swallow the 
soul of even the most innocent people. 
At least "Mad City" sports a nice technical feel, a handful of good scenes 
(there's one where a network affiliate suggests that Max get Sam to surrender 
on Thursday night -- a time when ratings are weak) and Alan Alda chewing the 
scenery as an odious field veteran. And of course it's an appropriate showcase 
for two strong performances from Hoffman and Travolta. Ironically, both actors 
have covered similar territories in previous vehicles -- the former starred in 
the news spoof "Hero" and the latter played a laid-off simpleton in "White 
Man's Burden." "Mad City" isn't as bad as either of those tankers, but 
considering the talent involved and the film's satirical potential (think "To 
Die For"), it's soft news that really could have been hard-hitting.

Cast: John Travolta (Sam Baily), Dustin Hoffman (Max Brackett), Mia 
Kirshner (Laurie), Alan Alda (Kevin Hollander).  Directed by 
Costa-Gavras.  Written by Tom Matthews and Eric Williams.
        You have seen it every night on the television: pushy reporters, 
microphones flying, cameras rolling at times of tragedy, the spotlight on 
the victim, innane questions from the anchor desk.  Its the mind-boggling 
flurry of the media blitz at its best, searching for the best, most 
sensational story, controlling the way the public sees the news.  Behind 
the scenes are the back-stabbing egomaniacs searching for the upper hand 
on the other guys.
        "Dog Day Afternoon" showed the effects of hostage-taker on the 
media.  "The Chase" showed the media's ratings-conscious attitude toward 
tense situations.  "Absence of Malice" displayed the way the media can 
harm its subjects.  Costa-Gavras' "Mad City" mixes all three of these, 
creating one of the more thought-provoking films of the year.  While 
countless films have examined the cutthroat world of journalism, they 
seem to forget about how they deal with the people inside the story.
        Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman) was once a leading network reporter 
whose grandstanding of Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda) during an airline 
crash has left him demoted to local news in Madeline, California.  
Covering fluff pieces and toting intern Laurie (Mia Kirshner) around 
leave him with little hope for reentering the big time.
        Sam Baily (John Travolta) was a security guard at the local museum, 
a victim of budget cuts.  Unable to tell his wife or to provide for his 
children, he returns to the museum with gun in hand so that he will be 
heard and hopefully regain his job.  Brackett had just done a story on 
the museum, placing him in the middle of what turns into a hostage 
situation.  A school field trip is trapped inside, raising the potential 
attraction of the story.  These two downward spiraling men become the 
nations attention.
        Baily accidentally shoots a black guard who kept his job, moving 
Brackett into the position of damage control.  In effect, he becomes the 
producer, director, and writer of the "greatest show in town" that will 
raise his credibility level in the media.  Brackett wins public opinion 
for Baily, running in and out of the museum controlling police action 
and how the public perceives who should be the villain.  Sam Baily 
becomes a hero who just wants his job back.  As the story becomes 
headlines, Hollander moves in.  In his private war with Brackett, 
Hollander upstages the event through some editing that turns Baily and 
Brackett into mere pawns in the hands of the fickle public.  
        Freshman writers Tom Matthews and Eric Williams hit upon a topic 
that will keep audiences seated, manipulating our emotions the way our 
onscreen counterparts are swayed by each shred of information.  Some 
lapses involving smaller stories do exist, but overall they have crafted 
an intriguing overview of the media-public relationship.  
        Brackett knows the game, teaching the hapless Baily the rules along 
the way.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell who has taken hostages 
here.  While Baily holds fifteen people, Brackett holds the world at his 
mercy.  He orchestrates the ordeal, forgetting that he cannot pull the 
plug; only Baily can finish it.  As much as Brackett thinks so, he 
essentially becomes powerless in his own production, going from 
following the story to part of it.  His decline in stature as the 
situation spins out of his control is most enjoyable to watch.
        Hoffman and Travolta put in solid performances, as control-monger 
and poor soul.  After appearing briefly in the aptly named 
"Sleepers," Hoffman seems to be back to his commanding form.  Travolta, 
meanwhile, continues his hot streakon the heels of this year's 
"Face/Off" and his well-received performance in the otherwise 
lackluster "She's So Lovely."
        "Mad City" closes with a view from above: booms, microphones, 
cameras, police, and a mob of reporters.  The consequences of 
Brackett's and Baily's actions pale in the face of the edgier story, 
business continues as usual.  This film leaves the viewer with the 
question: who are the victims in the media blitz?  This movie argues 
that everyone is.  From the reporters' integrity to the audience's 
trust, nothing is untouched or unsoiled by the finish.  While the 
characters of "Mad City" learn nothing, the viewers of this solid and 
enjoyable film can go home and ponder the message.
