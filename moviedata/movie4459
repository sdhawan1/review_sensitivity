As geeky as it sounds, I must admit it--when it comes to _X-Men_, I am
what is called a "fanboy."  I grew up fervently following the comic book
exploits of the team whose membership is made of genetically evolved,
superpowered "mutants."  Seeing a group of guys and gals kicking serious
ass with their superhuman abilities is undoubtedly a major factor in my
(and many others') interest, but what has made _X-Men_ so popular--and
very passionately so, at that--are the realistic characters, authentic
people who just happen to have powers.  And while most comics treat their
heroes' and heroines' abilities as simply a cool gift, for the X-Men and
mutants in general, it is also very much a curse; much like any other
minorities, mutants face severe prejudice from the rest of the
population.
So adapting _X-Men_ and its sprawling, 30-year-plus history into a
100-minute feature film is a dicey proposition for any filmmaker, and
even moreso for one who was not a fan to begin with--such as Bryan
Singer, who is at the helm of Fox's lavish, long-awaited $80-million
extravaganza.  Not only must he appease the fanboys by not deviating too
far from the source material, he must also make what is essentially a
three-decade-long-and-counting soap opera accessible to the non-fan.  And
contrary to fans' greatest fears, Singer's _X-Men_ is an exciting,
fast-paced adventure that will satisfy both audiences.
For a summer blockbuster--especially one based on a comic book--an
$80-million budget is a pittance, but it's an appropriate figure for
_X-Men_.  Spectacular visual effects are called for (and are effectively
employed) to bring the team's powers to life, but the budget limitation
forces the filmmakers to make the effects a carefully used enhancement of
the story and characters, which are hence given more weight (as they
always had been in the comic).
For the most part, credited scripter David Hayter and a gaggle of
uncredited scribes (including Singer's Oscar-winning _Usual_Suspects_
partner Christopher McQuarrie and _Buffy_ maestro Joss Whedon) succeed in
making the characters mirror their counterparts on the page.  The X-Men
is a team of mutants led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a
powerful telepath who runs a school for "gifted youngsters" and fights
for mutant tolerance.  As the film begins, his team consists of Jean Grey
(Famke Janssen), a telekinetic (i.e., can move objects with her mind) and
a telepath herself; Scott Summers, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden), who
cannot control his deadly optic blasts; and Ororo Monroe, a.k.a. Storm
(Halle Berry), who can control the weather.
Those established members, however, take a backseat in the film to the
new recruits, Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna
Paquin).  The wild, mysterious Wolverine is perhaps best known for his
retractable, razor-sharp claws made of the indestructible metal
adamantium (his entire skeleton is also bonded with it), but his mutant
abilities are heightened senses and a rapid healing factor.  Rogue can
absorb a person's lifeforce, personality, and memories (and, in the case
of other mutants, powers) with a single touch.  After discovering her
ability after kissing her boyfriend, a distraught Rogue flees her native
Mississippi for snowy Canada, where she meets Wolverine.  When the two
are attacked by the evil and animalistic Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), it's
Storm and Cyclops to the rescue, and Wolverine and Rogue soon find
themselves getting acquainted with the ways of Xavier's school.
Jackman, an unknown Australian actor known for his musical theater
credits, and the teenage Paquin were Singer's two most controversial
casting choices.  Only one will completely win over skeptical fans:
Jackman, who completely inhabits Wolvie's wild, woolly persona; from his
first scene, fans should have no doubt about the actor's ability to
embody the character's trademark ferocity.  Paquin will have a harder
time of convincing the fanboys.  Young, waifish, and unglamorous, she in
no way resembles (in appearance and temperament) the sexy, sassy,
voluptuous, and now-20something comic book Rogue (the team's most popular
female member).  But within the context of the film's story--that is, as
a "starting point" Rogue--her casting is understandable, and aside from
an inconsistent Southern accent, Paquin is perfectly adequate.  Even so,
for the inevitable sequel, I suggest Singer pull an Anakin Skywalker and
age Rogue a few years by way of a recast--and thus bringing to the screen
the true Rogue fans know and love.
Needless to say, Rogue is the character that is least true to her
printed incarnation.  In addition to the change in age, she is given a
real name (Marie), and her upbringing by evil mutant shapeshifter
Mystique (and, hence, Rogue's history as a villain) is completely
jettisoned.  Mystique does appear in the film (played by Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos), but only as part of a fairly faceless support team (along
with Sabretooth and the aptly named Toad, played by Ray Park) for the
film's central villain, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto is an old friend
of Xavier's, but the two drifted apart over their difference of
philosophy.  Xavier believes that there is hope for regular humans to
accept mutantkind, but Magneto doesn't, preferring to go to war with
them.
Magneto's dastardly scheme to bring humans and mutants to level genetic
ground is the focus of the plot, and this thin story is indeed the film's
weakest element.  But the shortcoming is easy to forgive when the
atmosphere and smaller details feel so right.  The whole allegorical
issue of "mutant hysteria"--perpetuated by bigoted U.S. Senator Robert
Kelly (Bruce Davison)--is well-developed and played with the earnestness
it deserves, as is a WWII-era-set prologue that faithfully details
Magneto's beginnings.  In fact, the serious--though never
pretentious--tone of the film perfectly matches that of the comic, never
veering into the camp sensibilities that have marred other
comic-to-screen adaptations.  Singer and the writers must also be
commended for doing a bang-up job with the character relationships.  The
tense triangle between Scott, Jean, and Logan is perfectly played out;
and Wolvie's bond with Rogue is also nicely handled.
But, being a fanboy, I'm not above nitpicking over certain things. 
While the Wolverine/Rogue relationship works in the film's context, in
terms of the comics it bears more resemblance to his bond with two other
young mutants, Kitty Pryde and Jubilee (both of whom have cameos in the
film), than anything he ever had with Rogue.  Another throwaway mutant
appearance, that of Iceman (here referred to only by his real name,
Bobby), is sure to upset purists; he's a teen and Rogue's kinda-sorta
boyfriend at Xavier's school.  Rogue's young age also means the erasure
of the fascinating sexual tension between her and Magneto, which could
have come into play at a crucial juncture of the film.  And pity poor
Storm.  While Berry gives the character appropriate poise and elegance,
the writers give her very little to do.  Her forceful leadership
abilities are gone, as are her claustrophobia (which should have been a
factor in one scene) and sisterly relationship with Jean.  Plus, what is
the deal with that woefully unconvincing wig and her brown eyes (they
should be blue)?
But some things have to give when adapting a comic to film (much like
any book-to-screen translation), and for this fanboy, it's a relief that
overall _X-Men_ the film bears uncommon fidelity to its source material. 
And as a critic, it's a relief to see an effects-laden popcorn movie
offer a bit more meat than is traditionally required of such films.  That
said, _X-Men_ is best seen as just the jumping-off point for a possible
big screen franchise--one whose full potential can be realized in
subsequent installments.

Review by Scott Hunt
Movie Hunt: http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html
(Romijn-Stamos). It changes skins from social commentary to action film
to character study, never quite showing its face long enough to get a
good look. What's seen in those glimpses are the promise of a thrilling,
potentially thought provoking franchise of movies.
an allegory to man's oppression of man, whether it's racial or
ideologically based. The X-Men are a group of people whose genetic
makeup differentiate them from the rest of mankind. Their mutant DNA
gives them enhanced abilities. Some are powerful telepaths able to read
minds, such as the X-Men's leader, Professor X (Stewart). Others can
control magnetic fields, giving them mastery over anything with metal in
it, such as Magneto (McKellen). Still others have enhanced healing
abilities, or can create ice, or fire. Rather than consider their
abilities a gift, they are often viewing by those possessing them,
mutants, as a curse, serving to ostracize them from society.
The comic book series has been wildly successful for decades, mixing
kinetic, savage action with an often-blistering acuity for capturing the
despair of the downtrodden and disenfranchised. X-Men, the movie, gleans
the essence of the comic and effectively puts it on the screen.
The film opens as a flashback study of its villain, Magneto. Seen as a
young boy, his family is ensnared in the machinations of the Nazi war
engine as soldiers tear young Erik's parents from him as the family is
sheparded into detention camps. The experience unalterably shapes his
worldview. He thinks the only way for mutants to survive is to dominate
those who would subjugate his kind.
His opposite, Professor X, has a background that's only hinted at. He is
obviously rich and influential. He believes that humans and mutants can
co-exist, despite a senator's (Davidson) efforts to whip the country
into an anti-mutant frenzy. It's a thinly veiled allusion to McCarthyism
and the nazi regime. Professor Xavier is an ersatz King to Magneto's
Malcolm X.
With two decades worth of character development to mine and a squadron
of characters to manage, Singer succeeds with mixed results. Hayter and
Singer shrewdly balance the action scenes with character development,
but due to time constraints, some actors come off better than others. Of
the X-Men, worst of the lot is Storm (Berry), who not only is given
nothing to do, but has an accent that noticeably fades in and out.
Wolverine is an intriguing mix of toughness and emotional vulnerability.
Blessed/cursed with a skeleton made of indestructible metal, blade-like
claws that can project from his hands and the ability to heal from
almost any wound, he forges a surrogate father relationship with Rogue
(Paquin). Much of the film's empathetic and emotional strength draws
from the wellspring of their budding relationship.
Jackman plays Wolverine with the sharpness of ..... While the classical
theater trained Stewart and McKellen serves as solid bookends for the
acting ensemble, it's Jackman who provides the entrancing, substantive
middle. His Wolverine is perhaps the most confused and lonely of all the
deadly. Jackman could have done a lot of self-conscious posturing and
overly pensive emoting, thereby crushing any hopes the film might have.
Instead, he plays it remarkably straight. Wolverine is  a confused,
grown man yearning to find a place in the world, rather than a
wisecracking, super thug with the right answer to every situation.
Cyclops (Marsden), the X-Men's field leader and love of Dr. Jean Grey
(Janssen), projects a borderline arrogant smarminess.  An unbalanced
attempt is made at a potential love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops
and Grey, but it's a sparkless connection.
Of the evil Brotherhood of Mutants, Toad (Park) and Sabretooth (Mane)
revel in the physicality of their roles. Sabretooth is an animalistic
sledgehammer of force, showing a reckless brutality unhampered by any
sign of true intelligence or cunning. Toad has all the grace of a grade
school bully, enjoying any opportunity to inflict pain with the warped
glee of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass. Romin-Stamos is a
bit of a cipher as Mystique. She has few words of dialogue and is
covered in blue scales and body paint, rendering her unrecognizable. Of
all the evil mutants, her presence is compelling. Is this due to some
heretofore-unseen acting ability, or the strength of the script playing
to her acting weaknesses?
The gist of the story involves Magneto's attempt to influence world
powers in embracing mutant kind, in the opposition to senator Kelly's
dogmatism on the subject. To that effect, he plans to use a special
device to genetically alter many of the world's leaders into mutants.
Xavier means to stop him. It's an admittedly simplistic story, but it
serves mainly to introduce the characters and set up conflicts for
future films. Hopefully future X-Men films will present themselves with
the same straight-faced earnestness of this one. By playing up the
humanistic angle, rather than heroic preening, Singer has made a film
that's accessible to both fans of the comic series and newcomers to the
storyline. There are obvious rends and tears in the fabric of X-Men's
script, but on the whole it plays as smart, fun entertainment with
promise. What more can you ask of summer fare?

It has taken over twenty years for Marvel Enterprises to adapt one of their 
comic books into a live-action motion picture, but they have finally 
succeeded with "X-Men," arguably their most popular current superhero series. 
Having never read the comic before, or seen the animated series, my only 
relation to the world of "X-Men" came eight years ago (when I was in middle 
school), at a time when the collectors' trading cards were all the buzz. I 
remember looking at my schoolmates' cards, and one night I even attempted to 
go buy some, but either I looked in the wrong place or they were all sold 
out. In the sixth grade, collecting "X-Men" cards was the "in" thing to do, 
and being an impressionable preadolescent, it was relatively easy to get 
swept up into the world of Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, and the many other 
characters. However, the fad never truly rubbed off on me, and aside from a 
cursory knowledge of some of the "mutants" and their powers, I went in to see 
the first "X-Men" movie, which is already shaping up to become a franchise, 
without knowing very much in the way of details.
Being a non-fan, it is with pleasure to report that "X-Men" is a good, 
respectable film--not 'great' by any stretch of the imagination--but one of 
the very few comic book adaptations that has been successfully translated to 
the big-screen. The opening chapter in the "X-Men" saga, I suspect, is more a 
set-up for grander, more satisfying, things to come, much like the original 
"Star Wars" was back in 1977. Some of the central characters are developed 
more than others, and there is a great deal of exposition for which the 
occasional action scenes are built around, but that is just fine, because 
like "The Empire Strikes Back," "X-Men II" will begin to fill in the missing 
puzzle pieces and concentrate on the characters and backstories that there 
was no time for in the original.
Set in the not-so-distant future, when the United States Senate is attempting 
to pass a bill against mutants (i.e. human beings who have obtained special 
powers due to DNA mutations), headed by the discriminatory, close-minded 
Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison). Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant whose family 
was taken away from him during WWII, suspects that another present-day 
Holocaust is at hand, and sets out with his henchmen, Mystique (Rebecca 
Romijn-Stamos), a blue-skinned shapeshifter; Toad (Ray Park), who has a very, 
very long tongue; and Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), a hairy man-beast, to prepare 
for war. On the opposing side, the so-called X-Men, mutants who strive for 
peace and acceptance, must stop Magneto before the point of no return. Headed 
by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), a wheelchair-bound telekinetic, the X-Men 
run a school for gifted mutants, with the faculty run by Dr. Jean Grey (Famke 
Jannsen), also a telekinetic; Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eyes shoot laser 
beams if not shielded by sunglasses; and Storm (Halle Berry), who can control 
the weather.
The X-Men acquire two new mutants to their team after saving Wolverine (Hugh 
Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) from an attack on a wintry Canadian country 
road by Sabertooth. Rogue, a frightened 17-year-old high schooler, has run 
away from home after kissing a classmate and inexplicably putting him in a 
coma for three weeks. Holing up in a bar, she meets Wolverine and suspects 
that they both may be mutants after seeing him get attacked by a group of 
troublemaking men and defending himself by extracting sharp blades from in 
between his knuckles. Because they both are outcasts, and Rogue cannot ever 
come into human contact with anyone without sucking their life energy from 
them, they quickly bond, and at first, do not know what to expect from the 
Without the careful handling of the characters of Wolverine and Rogue, 
"X-Men" would   feel like a shallow excursion to oft-covered territory, just 
as most comic book adaptations fall into the trap of. However, as played by 
Aussie newcomer Hugh Jackman and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin (1993's 
"The Piano"), and scripted by David Hayter, Wolverine and Rogue spring to 
life, forming the heart and soul of the rather simplistic story. The 
camaraderie that develops between the two, with Wolverine sort of becoming 
the surrogate guardian of Rogue, is nicely developed and sweet.
The other X-Men aren't nearly as fully drawn, with most slinking in the 
background for large periods of time, only to come into their own when they 
must use their powers to save themselves or those around them. The exceptions 
are Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek") and Ian McKellen (1998's "Gods and 
Monsters"), as Professor X and Magneto, respectively, the leaders of their 
conflicting sides. Both performers are effective and suitably cast, and this 
is an especially nice change from Stewart's usual role as Captain Picard in 
the "Star Trek" movies.
Meanwhile, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, despite having next to no dialogue, is 
seductively threatening and leaves a memorable impression as Mystique, 
arguably the nastiest villainess since Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in 1992's 
"Batman Returns." As the other evil opponents, Ray Park, as Toad, and Tyler 
Mane, as Sabertooth, are fairly inconsequential characters, and the film 
neither benefits nor suffers from their appearances. On the "good" side, 
Famke Janssen (1999's "House on Haunted Hill") and Halle Berry (1998's 
"Bulworth") are likable as Jean Grey and Storm (who has my personal favorite 
superpower), but they have very little screen time and even less to do. In 
the next "X-Men" installment, I am sure they will be more prominently 
displayed. Finally, James Marsden is sorely disappointing as Cyclops, 
although it is difficult to say whether his utter blandness is the fault of 
the actor, or merely because he has the least to do. Based on his strong 
previous work in 1999's "Disturbing Behavior" and 2000's "Gossip," my 
suspicions point to the latter. 
Unlike the "Batman" series, which catastrophically plummeted in quality 
following "Batman Returns," "X-Men" relies more on storytelling than the 
visual flair of the set design and cinematography, which is a wise choice. 
Whereas "Batman" is a fantasy almost through-and-through, "X-Men" is set in a 
realistic version of today's world, with characters that only happen to have 
powers beyond normal human capabilities. Nonetheless, the visuals are 
occasionally impressive, particularly a beautiful shot of a snow-covered 
Canadian vista that is reminiscent of 1999's gorgeous "Snow Falling on 
Cedars," as well as the climax set atop the Statue of Liberty.
At 100 minutes (including end credits), "X-Men" reaches its finale about 
fifteen minutes too quickly, leaving a sneaking feeling that a fair amount of 
footage was left on the cutting room floor. Better to end while leaving its 
audience wanting more, however, rather than wearing out its welcome with an 
excessive running time. In an attempt to bring a Marvel comic book to life, 
20th Century Fox has created an entertaining, if slight, motion picture in 
"X-Men," undoubtedly only the beginning in a successful new franchise, and if 
it's any indication that director Bryan Singer (1995's "The Usual Suspects") 
has succeeded, I am already anxiously awaiting a sequel. Look for it to be 
released in 2002. You can mark my word with a capital "X."

     There is a war going on.  The battlefield is all around us, but
we normal people do not see it being fought.  We will, but not yet.
There are around us mutants with special powers far superior to us
humans.  But the war is not yet between them and us.  Right now it
is between two factions of mutants.  And we humans are just
bystanders whose fate may depend on the outcome of that conflict.
This is the plot of David Cronenberg's 1981 film, SCANNERS.  It was
indeed a very original and atmospheric film.  However that same plot
also describes X-MEN made almost two decades later.  Now it may well
be that SCANNERS could have taken some inspiration from the X-MEN,
but Cronenberg did the in film first.  Even if the Marvel Comics X-
MEN preceded the film SCANNERS, it is an idea that has already been
explored in film and probably more intelligently in a previous film.
Most of anything is good about X-MEN has been done better elsewhere.
     The film opens at an unnamed concentration camp.  A young
Jewish boy is separated by force from his mother.  Trying to follow
her he is restrained by four guards and in his grief somehow causes
two metal gates to bend.  (There are two things wrong with this
scene.  The Jews they show are in a condition too good.  They
probably would not be brought to the camp without already having
been through much rougher treatment than implied.  Also a Jew
causing this much trouble would simply have been shot.)  We see that
the boy, Eric Lehnsherr, obtains his powers from his own mental
anguish and that he has good reason for mistrusting and hating human
nature.  Perhaps understanding this is why Dr.  Xavier (Patrick
Stewart) and he remain lifelong friends.  One would expect them to
be enemies.  Each leads one of two opposed factions of mutants.
This friendship of adversaries is probably the most remarkable and
unexpected twist of the script.  Lehnsherr (now played by Ian
McKellan) leads a faction of militant and ugly mutants, preparing
them for war against humans.  Xavier trains his attractive mutants
to co-exist with the normal humans.  Invited to join the fold are
two new mutants: the nihilistic Logan, known as Wolverine (Hugh
Jackman), and the very confused Marie, called Rogue (Anna Pacquin).
Xavier runs a school for mutants not unlike the one in Brian De
Palma's THE FURY.  The school is complete with a huge spherical
chamber the design for which seems to come from Terry Gilliam's
BRAZIL.  To this school he invites the new mutants Rogue and
creature of rage Wolverine, a creature who likely was inspired by
the animal ferocity of Lawrence Talbot in THE WOLF MAN.
     David Hayter wrote the screenplay based on a story by director
Bryan Singer of THE USUAL SUSPECTS and by Tom DeSanto.  Occasionally
the lines are unintentionally humorous.  The first line of the film
says that mutation has allowed us to evolve from one-celled
creatures to the dominant life form on this planet.  Of course when
there was only one-celled creatures, that WAS the dominant life
form.  Occasionally the writers overstate their point.  At one place
we anti-mutant people hanging "Mr. Mutant" in effigy.  This is a
little heavy handed.  I think discrimination these days would take
more subtle forms after this sort of expression has been so
obviously associated with racism.
     The art direction and set design give this film a nice look
down to detail like X-MAN symbol shows up as the wheels of Xavier's
wheelchair.  They have not given in to satire or levity.  Instead
this is a nice dark story that wants to be taken seriously.
Unfortunately when the fight scenes play fast and loose with
Newton's Laws the feel drops to the level of a bad martial arts
film.  The film has a lot to see, but not much to think about.  It
all builds to a large fight out in the interior of the Statue of
Liberty, perhaps a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.
     That makes it all the more surprising that it attracted the
acting talent that it did.  Patrick Stewart, Formerly of the
Starship Enterprise and currently of the cast of Arthur Miller's
"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan" plays the lead.  Ian McKellen is one of
the finest actors living, but the role of a super-villain in a
costume may stretch his talents.  Anna Paquin of THE PIANO is
reasonable as the troubled Rogue.  Bruce Davison who was touching in
LONGTIME CONPANION and on Broadway as THE ELEPHANT MAN has not much
to do as a United States Senator bigoted against mutants.  This is
hardly one of his better roles.  Famke Janssen who played Xenia
Onatopp in GOLDENEYE is on-hand, apparently as Xavier's assistant.

Back in high school, my best friends used to spend their allowances every
Thursday on the week's release of new comics. "X-Men" topped that list.
Still comic book collectors today, they told me about the creation of this
film some time ago. And so I looked forward to it, not as an apostle, but as
an outsider peeking in. I hoped to share their enthusiasm, but I feared a
cartoony recreation, overly impassioned with larger than life characters.
Fortunately, my fears were for naught!
"X-Men" is a film for moviegoers. Yes it has the action, but also solid
dialogue, acting, and careful astute direction. Often films beg some
patience from their audiences whilst laying out the story in careful order
to enter their climax at the right angle. The best films build steadily,
compelling at every turn. "X-Men" levitates so effortlessly that the climax
is upon us before we even know it. That's a careful script and excellent
direction.
Of course the characters are endearing as well. It helps immensely that they
don't take themselves too seriously, smirking at the overly profound
nicknames they've each somehow acquired.
The X-men are mutants. Every so often evolution skips a millennium or so and
leaves the human race a handful of individuals with varied and superior
power. Wolverine (played superbly by Hugh Jackman) has a metal alloy
integrated into his skeleton and the power to heal his injuries in seconds.
Storm can summon the rage of a tempest. Cyclops can destroy any target with
a pinpoint laser ray emitted from his eyeband. Etc.
Sounds like kids' stuff on paper, but David Hayter's script is so well
adapted that I expect adults to be flocking to this film in greater numbers
than non-conservative parents to "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." In
fact, so many people rsvp'd that the pre-release showing I attended played
in two screening rooms.
This story's conflict arises when regular humans fearing mutants in the
classroom etc., discuss forcing mutants to register themselves and their
specific powers. The mutants are split on how to counter this movement. Ian
McKellen and old buddy Patrick Stewart are the two kingpins that play a game
of chess with their small but talented mutant armies. The title says it all,
there is very little regular human involvement here, however, there are some
really sweet fight scenes between mutants including one that is ballet
beautiful. More Kudos to the scriptwriter for keeping the combat dialogue
free of "I'm going to get you!" or "Now I'm really mad!" type comic book
cliché. In fact, the battle scenes are appropriately uncluttered with words.
There's also drama and sweetly surprising humor sown in.
Simply put, "X-Men" is good entertainment.

Janssen, James Marsden, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-stamos, Ray Park, Anna
Paquin.

Unlike novels, comic books have traditionally proven extremely difficult 
to translate to the big screen. The list of quality film versions of 
comics is precipitously short: the original "Superman", the odd-numbered 
"Batman"s, "The Matrix", and little else. Marvel Comics -- historically 
one of the two dominant players in the comic book industry -- has been 
particularly inept in turning its super-heroes into box office gold, with 
most of its films either dying a quick death or going straight to video 
("Blade" being a notable exception).
Part of the reason for this is that several movies featuring Marvel's 
toplining characters have been stuck in development hell for years. 
Finally, however, their most popular franchise has made it into theatres as
"X-Men", a film about mutants, humans who represent mankind's next stage 
of evolution. Mutants develop extraordinary powers, but have incurred the 
suspicion and fear of normal people as a result.
Mutant abilities usually manifest themselves after puberty, as with 
Southern teenager Marie (Anna Paquin). While making out with her 
boyfriend, she discovers that her touch drains a person's "life force" -- 
whether she wills it or not. Panicking, Marie hits the road, assuming the 
alias "Rogue". Making her way into northern Canada, she meets Wolverine 
(Hugh Jackman), a mutant with a shadowy past who rapidly heals wounds and 
has metal claws which emerge from his hands.
Wolverine and Rogue are attacked by the super-strong Sabretooth (Tyler 
Mane). They are saved by Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots lasers from 
his eyes, and Storm (Halle Berry), who controls the weather. Together 
with telekinetic Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops and Storm are 
members of the X-Men, a team of mutants formed by Professor Charles 
Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that mutants and regular humans 
should strive for peaceful coexistence. He is opposed by Magneto (Ian 
McKellen), whose Brotherhood of Mutants -- including the nimble Toad (Ray 
Park), shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and Sabretooth --
is dedicated to the eradication of non-mutants.
The "X-Men" comic book was borne out of the social unrest of the Sixties, 
with mutantkind acting as a catch-all parallel for any oppressed 
minority. That metaphor is no less effective today, and the "X-Men" movie 
adroitly paints a world which resents mutants, without going over the 
top. We can understand why normal humans react the way they do, even if 
we disagree with them.
Particularly well-handled is Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), a 
McCarthy-like figure who wants to enact mutant registration laws and 
other rights-restricting measures. An early scene in which Kelly waves 
around a list of "known mutants" is chilling -- made all the more so by 
the excellent publicity strategy for the film, which saw real people 
"campaigning" for Kelly and the creation of an "anti-mutant" website.
"X-Men" boasts several fine performances, particularly Jackman as the 
feral Wolverine. He manages to infuse his anti-hero role with humor and 
nobility, creating an exciting, engaging character. Also commendable is 
Paquin as Rogue, the film's most tragic figure. She conveys the panic and 
confusion Rogue experiences without neglecting the spunk and 
self-confidence which propels her character. The other actors have more 
limited screen time but generally do a good job with their material. Of 
note is Park ("The Phantom Menace"'s Darth Maul) who turns the 
potentially farcical Toad into an enjoyable yet threatening character. The 
entire array of "X-Men" characters is well chosen, diverse in both power 
and appearance.
Visually, "X-Men" is inspired, making the most of its comparatively 
limited budget (about US$75 million, in an era when most movies of its 
stature cost twice as much). Magneto's island base and the X-Men 
headquarters are well-designed, and the special effects are low-key but 
convincing. The realisation of super-hero costumes has long been a sore 
point for the genre; "X-Men" eschews the heroes' comic book attire for 
stylish motorcycle uniform-type outfits. The film also boasts some lovely 
attention to detail. For instance, one young mutant (inspired by the 
comics character Iceman) has the power to instantly freeze moisture. When 
he speaks, you can see his breath.
Director Bryan Singer does an effective job, setting the tone with a 
faux-"Schindler's List" scene of a young Magneto in a Nazi concentration 
camp. (This has drawn some criticism for being inappropriate, but I 
thought it was tactfully handled, and established a palpable mood.) 
Singer avoids the extremes of the "Batman" franchise by not letting 
things get too campy or too grim. He allows for a lot of humor (including 
some cute in-jokes for fans of the comic book) without forgetting the 
serious nature of the allegory the film is drawing.
It is unfortunate, then, that the script (by David Hayter and a host of 
uncredited contributors) treats the anti-mutant subject matter only 
cursorily after the first few minutes. At one point, Wolverine asks Storm 
if she truly believes Xavier's side is the right one. But the question 
may as well have been rhetorical, so little doubt is there as to anyone's 
allegiances.
The movie's biggest flaw is that it spends so much time on set-up that 
the actual meat of the plot (Magneto's strike against mankind) seems 
almost an afterthought. To an extent, this is unavoidable, given the 
dizzying number of characters and concepts to be comprehensibly 
introduced. But I don't see why "X-Men" couldn't simply have been 
lengthier -- at just over an hour and a half, it is not exactly a long 
movie.
I can only guess that the filmmakers felt the need to pander to the 
attention span-deficient MTV generation, and feared that a protracted 
movie would be less commercially viable. But I never found my interest 
flagging at any point; indeed, I wanted to know more about these 
characters and see the plot better developed. I was sorely disappointed 
that these things did not happen. If nothing else, "X-Men" leaves me 
looking forward to the sequel for which it is so clearly paving the way.

     Well, comic book freaks can take a breather, as another sci-fi
fantasy hits the big screen, this time in the long-awaited,
highly-anticipated, it-better-be-good X-Men.
     Without too much regret, I can say that X-Men will be palatable to
fans and newbies alike.  It's not a great film, but it will probably
follow the arc of the Superman and Batman movies -- tons of sequels of
variable quality until an abrupt and dismal end a decade later.
     The film is largely focused on introducing the very idea of the
has mutated to the point where various members of it find themselves
endowed with superhuman abilities: telepathy, walking on water/through
walls, regeneration, and the like are commonplace.  As with most modes
of difference, the mutants find themselves vilified by the public, and a
Senator (Bruce Davison) launches a crusade to mandate "mutant
registration."
     How the group of X-Men came to be is unclear, but we do know that
Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is their leader and that he's wealthy
beyond belief, funding an apparently tuition-free school for mutant kids
where they can harness their powers in peace.  Dr. X (X-Men, get it?)
recruits adults, too, with monikers like the laser-eyed Cyclops (James
Marsden), the weather-controlling Storm (Halle Berry), and the
telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) -- the only X-Person who
doesn't have a nickname.  Together, the X-Men peacefully oppose the
government's anti-mutant tide, while battling the "evil" Magneto (Ian
McKellan), a concentration camp survivor that can control metal with his
mind.
     Soon the film begins to turn around newcomers to the X-Men -- the
super-tough Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the power-stealing Rogue (Anna
Paquin) -- and a Magneto plot to capture them consumes the rest of the
movie.  Ultimately it is revealed that Magneto's plan is to give all the
human leaders of the world a mutation of their own, through a
contraption he's built that will be unveiled at a conveniently-timed
"World Summit" on Ellis Island.  Whew!
     Strangely enough, X-Men is not as complicated as it sounds.  In
fact, its major flaw is that it spends the bulk of an hour simply
explaining what mutations are, who the good guys and bad guys are, and
what their respective powers are.  Everyone has two names -- a real one
and a nickname like "Sabretooth" -- and at least one has the power to
shift shape (an unrecognizable Rebecca Romijn-Stamos with no lines in
her own voice).  The exposition is necessary to have the movie make
sense, but it weighs the film down with a tedium that takes you
completely out of the action.
     That aside, X-Men's biggest flaw is that all mutants appear to be
stupid beyond belief.  Xavier and Magneto are presented to us as genius
arch-rivals, but the plots Magneto cooks up to capture the enemy are
straight out of an old "Batman" TV show episode.  Why go to all the
trouble to trick one mutant and poison another when you can just send
your shapeshifter in to do the dirty work?  Why can't Dr. X figure out
why Magneto is interested in Wolverine?  I suppose questioning the logic
of a movie called X-Men makes me sound a bit nutty, but there it is.
     While fans will appreciate the largely accurate portrayal of the
team (with the notable exception of Rogue being played as a barely
pubescent teenager), inside jokes like cracks about Wolverine's yellow
Spandex will be lost on most of the audience.
     Ultimately, X-Men is a reasonably entertaining movie, but it's one
that started to bother me the moment I left the theater.  Here's why: 
The X-Men want to stop a potential war between humans and mutants, and
Dr. X thinks Magneto is brewing this war up.  But Magneto isn't doing
anything of the sort.  He's cooked up this machine that will give
mutations to humans -- and therefore a better understanding of mutants,
and ergo, no war.  Magneto has a great idea!  If his machine worked
right, everything would have been peachy.  The fact that it doesn't
feels inserted by one of the half-dozen uncredited screenwriters just to
make the movie a little less nonsensical.
     Anyway, I predict the legacy of X-Men to be this:  1) There will
undoubtedly be a sequel.  2) It will be a whole lot better than the
original.  Vive la difference.

Running Time: 100 Minutes (dependant on which movie theatre you are in) 
So here it is, the film fans have been waiting for for over a decade, 'X-Men' 
finally comes to the big screen in an all-out adventure, full of eye popping 
special effects, great stunts, fantastic acting and a wonderful story. When I 
first heard they were making a live action version of the movie, I was quite 
skeptical. I knew I was going to see it, but I wasn't sure if it was going to 
be good. Then the first teaser trailer came out and I lost all hope. It was 
so dumb and so confused they should have just left it alone. Then a few weeks 
later the full trailer came out and I was stunned, the film looked great, it 
looked wonderfully edited, directed and acted and I was hyped up to see it. 
Finally the day came I got to see it, and I must say I was a bit 
disappointed, but I still enjoyed the film immensely.
The movie follows the cartoon and comic books to a T. I don't want to ruin 
the story so I will just tell you the basic plot: Mutants are despised by 
humans, because of some of the things they can do, the senate wants mutants 
to come out in the public with what they have, and register themselves so we 
are aware of what they can do. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is 
a very powerful mutant who has made a school for the gifted children who have 
these certain powers. Rogue and Wolverine are two confused mutants who meet 
each other in a bar after Rogue witnesses Wolverines sharp claws almost go 
through a guys throat. He takes her with him on the road, but a ways down 
they hit a tree and Logan (Wolverine) is thrown through the window, then 
being attacked by a evil mutant Magneto's pack. 
Then we finally get to see the good guys, Storm and Cyclops rescue Wolverine 
and Rogue and bring them to the home of Professor X. Wolverine isn't quite 
sure of what is going on, but soon realizes that this place is where he needs 
to be to live safe and free among other mutants, Rogue who was always scared 
of what she could do, now lives freely in the home. Magneto a very powerful 
mutant is after the X-Men because of the powers he has and because he is 
aware that there is a war brewing between humanity and mutants. Professor X 
and his team of X-Men must try to stop Magneto from destroying the entire 
world before its too late. Hold on to something because your in for a ride!
Don't worry I didn't give much of the plot away, thats just an outline. The 
film is very well conceived with its plot, and I was pleasently pleased to 
find out that each character has a backstory which adds much to the study of 
these people. I realized however when the film was over that even though it 
didn't have that much action, this movie is just starting it all. The sequel 
(which is coming out) will be continuing it, and so on and so on. The 
direction by Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) is  amazing, the action 
scenes, and the choreography in the film is amazing. The special effects are 
mind-boggling and some of them look incredibly real.
The characters we have is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who is a great character, 
brought to life by an emotional back story. Hugh Jackman brings the character 
to the screen with a bang, and is probably the only person who could have 
played Wolverine this good, Anna Paquin plays the mysterious Rogue, which as 
first I was skeptical about, but after seeing her play the part I will say I 
was impressed by her motions and by her accent she put to the character. 
Famke Jansen plays Jean Gray but for some reason her character seems pushed 
back and not doing much, but non-the-less she does a great job in her 
character, Halle Berry does a good job on playing Storm, but either she 
didn't bring the character out as much as she could have, or the character 
just wasn't brought out in the script, because like Jean Gray she seems a bit 
pushed back. James Marsden is good as Cyclops, and is given some great comic 
relief between him and Wolverine. Perhaps the best performance of the X-Men 
is Patrick Stewart who is priceless as Professor X, he plays him with such 
agility, such expertese that he gives one of the best performances Ive seen 
this year.
Of the bad guys, Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos plays Mystique who is a 
shapeshifting, very sexy character that is completely naked with blue all 
over her body. Of course its PG-13 so you cannot see anything. Tyler Dane 
plays Sabretooth and is extrmely well at it, Ray Park who played Darth Maul 
in Episode 1 plays Toad here who is a pointless character but non-the-less a 
great one. Of course the best of the bad guys is the fantastic Ian McKellan 
who brings out the character of Magneto more than anyone else could, there is 
a scene in the film when Patrick and Ian are together talking and it is 
amazing to watch these two talented actors work.
Even though the movie has these pluses, it also has its minuses. First of all 
some of the characters are undeveloped, for instance we don't get very much 
background on Cyclops of Jean Gray. There are many scenes that seem to go and 
on with talky dialogue, and not enough action. The climax of the film is very 
well made, but I found that it went way to fast. Of course these flaws come 
with the movie because it sets up for the sequel. Even with these flaws, 
seen this year. Its worthy of a movie theatre trip possibly twice or even 
three times. For the fans of X-Men like me, your gonna love it!

The X-Men hold a special place in my heart. As a kid, I was there when they
made their debut in 1963. On the surface, the Marvel comic book bore quite a
resemblance to The Fantastic Four, another Stan Lee and Jack Kirby creation,
but the X-Men represented a crucial twist on the superhero concept. These
young people were mutants, treated with fear and hatred by mainstream
society just because they were different.
Such an inspired notion. In one fell swoop, Lee and Kirby gave the
disenfranchised a comic they could call their own. The X-Men were surrogates
for blacks, gays, alienated teens - any group who felt the sting of
stereotyping and societal intolerance. While Superman and the Fantastic Four
battled galactic overlords, the X-Men were busy fighting simply for their
right to be, and kicking major bigot ass when necessary.
Professor Charles Xavier, a wheelchair-bound telepath of enormous power,
served as teacher, father figure and group leader in his position as
headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Children, a haven for mutant
youth. Over the years, the series experienced major changes, including an
enormously successful reboot that replaced the original students with a more
ethnic and racially diverse group of mutants. Eventually, the X-Men
franchise split into a series of titles featuring so many characters that it
was virtually impossible to keep track of them all.
Twenty-seven years after their creation, the X-Men have finally made it to
the big screen, in what may well be the best cinematic superhero adaptation
to date. While director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") shifts
characters around and stumbles periodically, he has captured the essence of
the comic book. The core team makeup is different, featuring two of the
original group and three from the later days, but the magic remains the
same.
"X-Men" takes place in the near future, with ultra-conservative Senator
Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) campaigning for the Mutant Registration Act,
which would allow the government to keep tabs on any citizen with mutant
DNA. While Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) of the X-Men tries to reason with
the self-righteous politician at a Senate hearing, Professor Xavier (Patrick
Stewart) senses the presence of an old friend in the chamber. The mutant
known as Magneto (Ian McKellan) does not share the guarded optimism of
Xavier. A Holocaust survivor, Magneto sees the hearings as the first step
towards a genetic war, and the master of magnetism is ready to make a
preemptive strike.
The battle lines are drawn. Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants: the
shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), man-beast Sabretooth (Tyler
Mane) and Toad (Ray "Darth Maul" Park), an incredibly agile creature with a
tongue that would make Gene Simmons weep with envy, versus Xavier's A-Team:
Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots laser blasts from his eyes, weather
witch Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey, who has a major in telekinesis and
a minor in telepathy. Joining the trio are two newcomers: Rogue (Anna
Paquin), a teen who temporarily drains the life force from anyone she
touches, and Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), a skilled athlete with amazing
healing powers and retractable, razor sharp claws that spring from the top
of his hands.
Director Singer, working from David Hayter's efficient script, forwards the
plot while providing a wealth of treats for X-fans. While visiting the
school, which has a much larger population than the one in the comic, other
brief, but cleverly staged appearances. There are several in-jokes for
attentive viewers, and we see the beginning of the love triangle between
Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey.
While most superhero movies struggle for an epic feel, "X-Men" thankfully
sets its burners a bit lower, playing like a solid issue of a cinematic
comic book and taking the time to flesh out a few major characters. The
story revolves around Wolverine, with Aussie actor Hugh Jackson giving a
knockout performance as the Canuck loner (asked if it hurts when his claws
come out, he quietly answers "Every time."). Although the onscreen Rogue is
significantly different from her comic book counterpart, Anna Paquin
beautifully conveys the angst of a girl who cannot ever enjoy the touch of
another person. And, thanks to a heart-wrenching prologue, we see the
damaged child beneath Magneto's regal persona. As expected, Ian McKellen and
Patrick Stewart are wonderful, particularly during their scenes together.
Despite limited screen time, Famke Janssen firmly establishes Jean Grey as
one tough, smart cookie and, in James Marsden's hands, the smirking,
tight-assed Cyclops becomes the perfect foil for Wolverine's verbal barbs.
Unfortunately, Halle Berry's Storm receives no personal development. To make
matters worse, Berry is saddled with a chintzy white wig straight from the
Eva Gabor Woolworth's collection.
Other quibbles include Sabretooth's growl, which sounds too much like the
MGM lion. A synthesis of animal and human roars would have been more
effective. And, primarily due to extensive wire work, some of the action
segments are a bit stiff. But these are minor complaints. "X-Men" neatly
balances character interaction with grand battles, while never forgetting
the theme that made the series a pop classic. For this fan, the film was a
very pleasant surprise. I suspect that those unfamiliar with the comic book
will have quite the good time as well.

years it has been since you enjoyed the wonderful escapist pleasures of
comic books, you can relive those happy times of your youth by watching
SUSPECTS).
Based on the comic books of the same name, first-time screenwriter David
Hayter has come up with a remarkably lucid tale given the complexity of
all the characters and their various skills, powers and motivations.  As
the story opens, it looks like it will be another POKEMON, in which the
only ones who can decipher what is happening are long-time veteran
viewers of the series.
In no time at all, however, the story is clear.  There are two groups of
mutants.  One, led by the honorable Professor Charles Francis Xavier
(Patrick Stewart, STAR TREK's Captain Jean-Luc Picard), wants to live in
peace with humans.  Another, led by the nefarious Magneto (Ian McKellen,
Oscar nominee from GODS AND MONSTERS), doesn't trust the human race and
has an evil plan to control them.  Given the superhuman powers of the
mutants, Homo sapiens don't appear to have much of a chance.
Meanwhile, back on Capitol Hill, jingoistic Senator Robert Jefferson
Kelly (Bruce Davison) doesn't trust the mutants and wants the government
to register them all.  This part of the story is lifted directly from
Senator McCarthy and the Commie scare of the 1950s.
Every mutant has different and unusual powers.  Toad (Ray Park, Darth
Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE) fights with a killer tongue like a
gigantic frog.  Storm (Halle Berry) generates her own perfect storm to
blow others away.  Cyclops (James Marsden) has killer, laser vision.
And Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is implanted with sharp, metal blades for
slicing and dicing opponents.
Hugh Jackman steals the show with his compelling performance as the
story's main fighter, Wolverine.  All of the performances are quite
good, including the work by the leads, Stewart and McKellen.  Anna
Paquin (THE PIANO), as apparently the most vulnerable mutant, Rogue,
turns in one of her best performances.  Rogue is an unhappy girl who had
the misfortune to have put the first boy who ever kissed her into a coma
for three weeks.  She has some special powers that are much in demand.
The fast-action fighting sequences are imaginatively choreographed and
fascinating, rather like watching gladiators with different weapons
going after each other.  And the movie is smart enough to inject just
enough well-placed humor to keep it from ever flagging.
After one twist and turn after another, we end up with the big
confrontation sequence, set at Ellis Island.  After this engrossing
battle, the movie makes its only small mistake, it takes too long
setting up for the sequel.  Just a hint would have been enough.  If they
will make it, we will come.
and would be fine for kids around 12 and up, depending on their ability
to handle a film of this intensity.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought it was great, giving it ****.  His
favorite character was Wolverine, and he had a long list of things he
liked about the movie.  His friend Steven, age 12, thought it was
exciting and gave it ***.  Steven's twin John thought it was only kind
of exciting and gave it ** 1/2.  None of them found it too violent, but
I'd still be careful about the movie when taking preteens to it if they
are sensitive to violence.

For the uninitiated:  The X-Men are superheroes who are mutants.  Mutants, 
according to Marvel Comics, are born with a genetic change which makes them a 
different species and gives each mutant a unique superpower that is 
manifested during puberty.  Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) formed 
the X-Men to combat evil mutants and founded a School for Gifted Youngsters 
so that teenage mutants would have a place to hang.  Xavier's philosophical 
opposite is Magneto (Ian McKellen), a militant mutant leader who wants to use 
force to make a place for mutants in the world.
The X-Men were introduced in the comic books in 1963 and revived with a new 
membership in 1975.  The new team prospered and soon became the most popular 
comic book in America.  Over the last twenty years, Marvel has spun-off 
numerous titles and introduced dozens of mutant heroes and villains.
In adapting the comics to a movie, the filmmakers had to pare down the 
comic-book cast to the most popular characters.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has 
an indestructible metal skeleton, sharp metal claws, the ability to heal 
nearly any wound, feral senses, and a disagreeable disposition.  Rogue (Anna 
Paquin) sucks the life-force out of people with her touch.  Cyclops (James 
Marsden) shoots laser beams out of his eyes.  Storm (Halle Berry) controls 
the weather.  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) moves objects with her mind, and 
Prof. X is a telepath.
The X-Men's arch-enemy, Magneto, emits magnetism.  His Brotherhood is a 
hodge-podge of popular villains from the comic books.  Sabretooth (Tyler 
Mane) is a furry beast-man.  Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) shifts shape, 
and the wall-crawling Toad (Ray Park) licks people from hundreds of feet away.
Here's the plot:  Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) is proposing 
legislation to register all mutants because he sees them as a threat to 
normal folks.  This brings to a head the ongoing feud between Prof. X and 
Magneto (Ian McKellen)  While that's brewing, teenager Rogue discovers her 
mutant powers and darts off toward Alaska.  In a seedy bar in the frozen 
north, she meets Wolverine.  They hang together long enough to introduce 
Wolvie's various attributes before Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) crashes the party, 
trying to recruit Rogue and Wolverine for the Brotherhood.  However, Cyclops 
and Storm end up taking home the beleaguered pair.  But Magneto isn't done 
with them yet . . .
Although many cranky X-Fans will be lamenting, "But what about [name of fave 
mutant here]?," six heroes, four villains, and a senator are a lot of 
characters for one movie.  Consider how bloated "Batman and Robin" was with 
only three heroes, three villains, and a butler.  It's easy to see why movies 
about superhero teams are even more rare than comic-book movies in general.  
There just isn't enough time to introduce and develop all those characters in 
the downtime between slugfests.  The solution that director Bryan Singer and 
screenwriter David Hayter come up with is brilliant; they focus on Wolverine 
and Rogue and sketch out the rest of the characters only as much as needed.  
Not only does that trim down the amount of exposition needed, but it also 
allows the audience to come to the X-Men from the perspective of a bewildered 
outsider.
The script does miss a few beats, though.  Magneto has this big evil machine 
that somehow works off of his magnetic powers, but no one ever really 
explains how it does.  The last scene confused me completely, but I can't 
really do into it without giving away the end.  Some of the humor works 
wonderfully (particularly the taunts between Wolverine and Cyclops), but 
other lines fall miserably flat.
Despite its flaws, "X-Men" is the first Marvel Comics movie to approximate 
the thrills of the comic book without stumbling into campiness.  Hayter's 
script incorporates crucial X-Themes.  As in the comics, mutants are a 
metaphor for any oppressed minority, allowing for blanket commentary on the 
politics of fear and hatred that use minorities to threaten the majority.  
Another common Marvel theme:  superpowers are more a curse than a blessing.  
This is particularly true for Rogue, who is a troubled teen terrified by her 
own powers.
"X-Men" is visually impressive.  The special effects are amazingly lifelike 
and include Toad's long-distance licking, Mystique's morphing, and Wolvie's 
claw-popping.  Some of the sets were rather bland (Prof. X has a thing for 
stainless steel walls) while others were quite inventive.  I wish the black 
leather uniforms were more colorful.
The cast is lead by two Shakespearean actors, Stewart and McKellen, and their 
resonant voices enriched their parts.  I wish that the script had given 
McKellen more meat to chew, but despite an early scene where we see young 
Magneto's mother dragged away to die in the Nazi gas chambers Magneto seems 
to be the standard badguy-bent-on-world-domination.  The bulk of the acting 
challenges went to Jackman and Paquin, and they both did fine jobs.  
Jackman's Wolverine is younger and less hard-boiled than his four-color 
counterpart, but Jackman gives us a well-rounded character who is sympathetic 
and likeable in spite of his gruff manner.  Oscar-winner Paquin is also in 
fine form and makes Rogue a teenage misfit we can all identify with.
Any movie version of something that has an insular cult following has to pull 
off the difficult task of appealing to both the faithful and the general 
public.  Singer aims for a middle ground between the two.  If you stand 
outside a theater showing "X-Men," you'll hear the True Believers exiting in 
heated discussion of how many things were changed.  I found it more fun to 
focus on how much the filmmakers retained:  Wolverine's adamantium skeleton 
and amnesia, the way Storm's eyes go white when she uses her powers, the 
Blackbird jet, even the street address of Xavier's School.   And what about 
all those moviegoers who don't know a mutant from a muskrat?  As I watched, I 
tried to imagine how I would react to this movie if I had never read an X-Men 
comic book.  I concluded that I might suffer from information overload and 
have a hard time following parts of the movie.  "X-Men" may prove a hard sell 
to the average popcorn-cruncher.
I had a great time, though.  I hope the effort proves successful and spawns 
sequels and imitations of the same high quality.  (The cast of "X-Men" are 
signed for two more pictures, so there's a likelihood of a trilogy if this 
one doesn't tank.)

Screenplay by David Hayter, based on the Marvel Comics characters
     It's the not-too-distant future, and mutants (the kind with 
superpowers) are beginning to make their presence felt in our society.  
Society is not pleased - you know how it gets about accepting people who 
are different.  As Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), the leader of the 
anti-mutant putsch, thunders in Congress, "Would you want them teaching 
your children?"
     The allusion to gay rights is clear, but it's tricky metaphorical 
ground.  Kelly is a McCarthyesque bad guy, but when he rants about the 
dangers these mutants pose, he's onto something - there are good mutants 
and bad mutants, but even the good ones are capable of some pretty 
horrendous destruction.  And as for the bad ones, well, you don't want 
to know. 
     Still, this is rousing, crisply done stuff for a summer action 
blockbuster.  It boasts a top director (Bryan Singer, The Usual 
Suspects), and a fine cast led by intense newcomer Hugh Jackman 
(Wolverine, who seems less a mutant than a victim of fiendish science) 
along with British veterans Patrick Stewart (Dr. Xavier, leader of the 
can't-we-get-along mutants) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, dark prince of 
the disaffected branch, who has good reason to distrust the essential 
decency of humankind.)  The Xs, by the way, include women - they're 
really X-People.  The movie has style, and emphasizes character as well 
as special effects, which makes a nice balance.  Ultimately it turns out 
to have nowhere to go, and halfheartedly mutates into the final credits. 
 But of course it does have someplace to go: a promising future of 
mutant sequels.

I find that the trick to superhero movies is to let the audience in on the joke, otherwise you wind up with disasters like "Batman and Robin," which turned the Batman franchise into such a sex-plagued travesty that all of its noir origins dissipated as a result. On the other hand, there are superhero movies that make you gasp in wonder at all the wondrous sights, and also make you identify with the protagonists, namely the superheros. Superman and Batman are two classic examples. "X-Men" is a close second - the first comic-book movie since Tim Burton's "Batman" that not only feels like a comic book yarn, it looks like one too. While watching it, I got the feeling that every sequence, every shot, was unspooling before your eyes like the dynamic sights of color and information that often leap from comic books. Stan Lee should be proud.
The X-Men, for those who have not read the comic books, are essentially powerful mutants - men and women with extraordinary powers that they seemed to have been born with. There is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who has metal claws that elongate from his hands when he gets mad; Cyclops (James Marsden), who has deadly laser vision protected by a visor; Storm (Halle Berry), who can conjure rainy weather when necessary; and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can turn people to stone if she touches them (she is not popular on the dating scene). These are the good mutants, presided by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has the ability to read minds. 
The evil mutants are presided over by Magneto (Ian McKellen), a former Holocaust survivor who wants the world population to be converted into mutants so they can be accepted into society. His minions include the tongue-lashing Toad (Ray Park), a human frog-of-sorts; the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), covered in blue-colored scaly skin; and finally Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), a growling animal, not unlike Wolvering though not as beastly.
The plot concerns an anti-mutant revolt started by a senator (Bruce Davison), who feels mutants present a danger to society. One can't quarrel with his view when witnessing the deadly emotions of Wolverine, seen at the beginning to be a bare-knuckled fighting champion for some kind of fight club, or the tragic, existential Rogue whose lips and mere touch warrant a coma-like paralysis or even death. Naturally, Magneto is at odds with the senator, as is Professor Xavier, though Magneto's plans are more dastardly - at least the kind-hearted professor is a believer in hope for his race. 
"X-Men" rivals other recent comic book extravaganzas in its character-driven story - these mutants are suffering because of their condition and unfortunate deviance from society. I tend to quarrel with people when they say entertainment is just sheer entertainment - even in something as hackneyed as "The Matrix," there is the sense that the filmmakers are sharing their thoughts about the world of today and how it is envisioned in these trying times. The best character in "X-Men" is Wolverine - an almost half-werewolf mutant with the ability to heal himself. He has a great line (that could sum up most of the mutant characters) when asked if the retraction of the blades from his knuckles hurt: "Every time," he says. 
My main quibble with "X-Men" is that it is simply an introduction to these characters - they come across as more than character types but they only seem defined by their powers. I know that it is too much to ask a blockbuster for some insight but consider what might have been. Wolverine is the most full-bodied character, but where does that leave Rogue and her emotional connection to him? What about Cyclops, Storm, the Professor or Jean Gray (Famke Janseen), the smart doctor who may have a thing for Wolverine? They are fun characters to watch, but who are they? And what about Magneto and his plans? He somehow does not seem to be such a major threat after all the sound and fury of the special-effects on display here. 
Still, "X-Men" is sheer fun to watch, and every moment gives us something to look at. The fights, the battles, and the characters (particularly the titanic Ian McKellen) contribute highly to the sense of fun it instills. And if this is what it takes to get the rumored "Spider-Man" movie rolling, then I am all for the "X-Men."

Back before I became a suave ladies' man, I was a big comic book fan. I
never read X-Men, but I was aware of the characters and the special
powers of most of the characters that appeared in the comic. The thing
that impressed me the most about X-Men was that they were basically
created out of laziness. Comic guru Stan Lee grew weary of coming up
with crazy ideas to serve as the origin for each of his superheroes. I
can just see him muttering to himself, ^ÓRadioactive spider bite ^Ĺ
exposure to gamma rays ^Ĺ okay, that^Ňs it. I^Ňm out of ideas.^Ô
So Lee came up with the notion of humans evolving and mutating into a
new race. Not only was it possible to give any character any special
power under the sun with virtually no explanation required, it also lent
itself to a fantastic subplot in which the mutants are forced to band
together as they find themselves outcast from society and generally
feared by the normals, a la witches, Jews, Blacks, Japanese, Communists,
and UK soccer fans.
While the comic has been going strong for over thirty years, its fans
have clamored for a feature film version of their mutant heroes. And,
boy, do they get it with Bryan Singer^Ňs (The Usual Suspects) terrific
adaptation that should both fulfill the expectations of geek-boys across
the world and provide great summer entertainment for people that don^Ňt
know mutants from mud-flaps. X-Men is easily the best traditional action
film I^Ňve seen this summer (as long as you don^Ňt count Gladiator as a
summer release).
studio logo to the opening scene showing a young mutant developing his
powers in 1944 Poland (it looks like a cross between Schindler^Ňs List
and Se7en) to the brilliant finale in, on and around the Statue of
Liberty The film^Ňs story, which practically leaves viewers begging for a
sequel, involves two groups of mutants.
One is led by Professor Charles Francis Xavier (Patrick Stewart, Star
Trek: Insurrection), who tries to teach young mutants how to control
their powers and function in modern society. The other ^Ö called the
Brotherhood of Evil ^Ö is commanded by Magneto (Ian McKellen, Apt Pupil),
a man hell-bent on destroying the world that wouldn^Ňt accept him as an
equal And how odd it is to see a big blockbuster summer action film that
stars two really old guys, not to mention the 180-degree turn for
McKellen, who played an ex-Nazi in Singer^Ňs Apt Pupil and a Polish Jew
here.
You might expect a film based on a comic book to begin with the series'
first issue, but that^Ňs not the case with X-Men. The film jumps into the
story midstream, so the viewer doesn't really get to learn the origins
of any of the existing mutants (other than the young Magneto). Instead,
^Ö Wolverine (hunky Aussie newcomer Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin,
She^Ňs All That). In Xavier^Ňs School for Gifted Children, you can also
catch glimpses of young versions of sequel-ready characters like Kitty
Pryde, Iceman, Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus. And if you look closely,
you^Ňll see Stan Lee make a cameo as a hot dog vendor in one scene.
The only complaints I have about the X-Men involve female characters.
The Storm character, played by Halle Berry (Bulworth), isn^Ňt as
prominently displayed as the others, and her character's transformation
makes the weakest jump from comic to screen, both in appearance and
development. Casting supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique may
have seemed like a good idea at the time, but what^Ňs the point of having
her in a film if you can^Ňt even tell it^Ňs her? Mystique, a
shape-shifter, is covered in scaly blue-green skin and, although the
character displays some nifty fighting moves, there^Ňs no way you can
tell when she^Ňs Romijn-Stamos and when she^Ňs a stuntwoman. Ray Park
(Darth Maul from Episode One) is a standout bad-guy in his portrayal of
Toad.
The rumors swirling around the casting of X-Men were unlike anything
I^Ňve ever heard before. The Wolverine character, which Jackson turns
into a huge star-making role, was originally supposed to be played by
M:I-2 baddie Dougray Scott, but he severely injured himself in a
motorcycle stunt in that film. Before Scott, half of Hollywood was
thought to be a cinch for the role of the steel-taloned Canadian,
including Russell Crowe, Elias Koteas and even (cough) John Leguizamo.
Actors that were ^Ólocks^Ô for other roles included Terence Stamp, Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Leonardo DiCaprio.
The rumor mill didn^Ňt stop when it came to X-Men^Ňs script, either. David
Hayter  (he was the voice of a garbage-eating possum in Doctor Dolittle)
received the only screenplay credit, while Singer and his Pupil
co-producer Tom DeSanto shared props for their ^Óstory.^Ô But the list of
other Hollywood scribes that supposedly had a hand in the film reads
like a who^Ňs who of the Writers Guild of America. They include Suspects'
Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie, Gladiator^Ňs John Logan, Ang Lee^Ňs
right-hand-man James Schamus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer^Ňs Joss Whedon,
Men in Black^Ňs Ed Solomon and Se7en^Ňs Andrew Kevin Walker.
But too many cooks didn^Ňt ruin this film. The film is dark and cynical,
and the writers set up a great rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops
(James Marsden, Disturbing Behavior), toss in some fantastic one-liners
and even include a poke at the yellow spandex that the superheroes wore
in the original comic. X-Men is also aided by top-notch work on the
technical end of things, from Michael Kamen^Ňs (Frequency, The Iron
Giant) score, to Newton Thomas Sigel^Ňs (Three Kings) cinematography, to
John Myhre^Ňs (Elizabeth) production design.

The summer of 2000 has a lot to offer when it comes to movies, and Bryan 
Singer's X-MEN only adds to your choices.
OK  it's not the comic book, but it's a darn well-made movie, with a large 
and solid cast, and you don't have to be familiar with Stan Lee's comics to 
pick up and enjoy the story.
The premise?  A result of quickened evolution, mutated humans have developed 
a range of extraordinary powers.  Trouble is, they pose a threat to the rest 
of humanity, or at least to those hatemongers who want to pass laws to force 
`mutants' to register (as Jews registered early during  the Nazi terrors?).  
Many mutants are allied with Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who 
runs a special school for `gifted youngsters' and who is himself a mutant, 
with powerful telepathic capabilities.  Dr. X's nemesis is Magneto (Sir Ian 
McKellen), a sometime friend who believes he is leading a war against humans 
 the species that would annihilate mutants.  Magneto's specialty is 
creating magnetic fields, and all kinds of mayhem involving metal.
A side conflict that flows into the primary one involves Senator Robert 
Jefferson Kelly (Bruce Davison), who is the main political force against 
mutants.  In one early scene he is assailing the credibility of Dr. Jean 
Grey (Famke Janssen), who is testifying before Congress on behalf of her 
fellow differently abled homo sapiens.  (Dr. Grey is telekinetic, with 
telepathic powers in their infant stages.)  What keeps us engaged in the 
story is the question of whether Magneto will succeed in his campaign 
against conventional humankind.  Will he thwart both Senator Kelly and the 
superintelligent Dr. Xavier?
The acting is strong, helping to make a fantastic story more plausible.  
Stewart delivers a magnificently understated performance, showing the 
control and range of emotion of a master actor.  I would tend to agree with 
some critics that McKellen is a tad too old for Magneto, though he too 
achieves a masterful subtlety of character.  This is a pair of seriously 
talented actors playing unusual but gripping antagonists.
Hugh Jackman plays a brooding Wolverine.  This character is virtually 
indestructible, his powers a bizarre combination;  his body almost instantly 
heals itself, but his mind is continually bothered by the traumatic 
experiments done to him at some earlier time (that he cannot remember).  The 
perverse experimenters implanted a wondrous metal skeleton throughout his 
body.  AnyhowWolverine is moody and extremely powerful, his sword-like 
talons shooting from his knuckles, and Hugh Jackman creates a level of 
sympathy that superheroes don't usually receive.
The rest of Wolverine's cohorts  the `good' X-Men working with Xavier  
include Janssen as Jean Grey, Grey's boyfriend Cyclops (James Marsden), 
Storm (Halle Berry) and the newcomer Rogue (Anna Paquin).  The baddies  
Magneto's henchmen  are Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), Toad (Ray Park), and the 
intriguing Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).  Although some of these 
characters are featured less than others, all of the actors turn in 
transparent jobs.
Bryan Singer keeps a tight pace but does not ignore characterization.  His 
scenes are functional, and they don't feel the pressure of supplying 
non-stop action.  We need to feel close to the featured X-Men, just as Stan 
Lee causes readers to sympathize with the print versions of these mutated 
heroes.  And character development serves Lee's creative purposes.
If you are a fan of the comic, you will be instantly aware of the plainness 
of the heroes' costumes.  Wolverine appears mostly in street clothes, and 
when he joins the other X-Men, he dons their same black body armor.  (We are 
treated to a piece of wit, by the way, concerning Wolverine's usual yellow 
tights.)  I think the lack of flamboyance actually helps the story; we are 
not distracted by the neon colors.  In addition, Jean Grey appears normal, 
Janssen's dark hair supplanting Grey's orange.  Good decisions, Mr. Singer.
In all, X-MEN does suffer from the formulaic blues, the clichés of superhero 
stories coming out all over.  But there is enough catchy dialog, cool 
powers, and human interest to make the running time seem very quick.  
Wherever your tastes in movies run, X-MEN will keep you entertained this 
summer.

Rogue (Anna Paquin) has the power to absorb a person's
living energy merely by touch.  She can't control this
power or its intensity.  Cyclops (James Marsden) must
wear a special visor; otherwise, opening his eyes will
create an explosive burst of deadly energy.  Thus, he
can never look upon the one that he loves with his own
eyes.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is an embittered and
belligerent soul.  He can't remember his past, and
worst of all, he has no idea how his body was
transformed into some kind of walking Ginsu knife.  
These are the X-Men, specially gifted people who are
psychologically conflicted.  "X-Men" the movie also
seems somewhat conflicted and unbalanced.  Yes, it has
some style and it's very cool to watch these wild
powers being unleashed.  And it's impossible not to
like Patrick Stewart as the benevolent Charles Xavier
and Ian McKellen as the bent-on-world-domination
Magneto.  But beyond this, there is little to marvel. 
It is conspicuously devoid of action sequences, though
the finale is impressive.  It lacks the color and the
energy that has propelled this comic book series into
the stratospheric best seller that it is.  And, there
are just so many characters that many of them speak no
more than two or three lines (though to be fair, this
series has introduced more than 300 since it first
appeared in 1963, and in this film, there are only
eight.)
Unfortunately, this movie is more about background
than anything else.  It's a 100-minute introduction
into the world of the X-Men, and this is exposition
that fans would probably rather do without.  "Every
few millennia," the narrator says, "evolution leaps
forward."  The result can be both wondrous and a
curse.  For example, some may develop telekinesis,
telepathic ability, or even the ability to control
weather.  Despite these amazing powers, because you're
a "freak of nature", you are feared and hated by
humanity.  At this moment in time, a zealous Senator
(Bruce Davison) is proposing a mutant registration
program.  He pleads to the people, "they are among us.
 We must know who they are and what they can do."
Although this worries the sagacious Xavier, he
believes that mutants and humans can peacefully
co-exist.  Magneto thinks otherwise.  From personal
experience, he knows what it's like to be an outsider
and the destructive rage of a bigoted society.  So, he
decides to show the human race firsthand what it's
truly like to be a mutant even if its consequences
might mean large-scale death of Holy War proportions. 
Supporting his efforts are Sabretooth (Tyler Mane),
who has the strength of 20 men and the speed of a
gazelle; The Toad (Ray Park), who creatively uses his
12-foot projectile-like tongue; and the colorful
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can assume the
likeness of just about anyone and does so with
reckless abandon.  But Xavier and his X-Men are well
trained in the use of their powers and are prepared to
do battle on behalf of mankind.  
The problem with "X-Men" is that it doesn't provide
sufficient power and pathos.  The average moviegoer
and especially the fans will be somewhat disappointed
with the generic plot line.  Many characters,
especially Storm (Halle Berry), are fairly flat and
only look cool when they summon up their powers.  The
one exception was Wolverine.  This walking switchblade
is probably the most popular character among fans. 
Newcomer Hugh Jackman understands the fan's
appreciation for Wolverine's testy nature.  To
properly motivate himself, he took a cold shower prior
to shooting.  He even gets the best line of the movie
when he turns to Cyclops and warns him to "keep your
eye open."  The film has its visual pleasures and some
amusing moments.  However, this limp adaptation does
this comic book sensation very little justice.

In the world of the X-men, the human race is divided into three factions. 
First we have the normal humans, led by Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison). 
Second, there are the students of the kindly Professor Charles Xavier 
(Patrick Stewart), who are working to live side by side with regular humans. 
Professor X and is students are mutants, meaning genetic mutation has 
granted them strange and powerful abilities. The professor is able to read 
peoples minds and control their actions through telepathy. His X-men (older 
students who have learned to control their abilities) include Cyclops (James 
Marsden), who can fire powerful beams from his eyes; Storm (Halle Berry), 
who can control the weather; and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who can move 
objects with her mind. Professor Xavier's old friend, Eric Magnus, aka 
Magneto (Ian McKellen), controls the second faction. This group believes 
that humans and mutants are heading for a war, and he intends to make the 
first strike. Magneto and his flunkies: Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), Mystique 
(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and Toad (Ray Park) intend to turn the leaders of 
the world into mutants so they will be on Magneto's side when the war comes. 
To do this he requires one of Xavier's two new students. The students are 
Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who can heal from nearly any wound and is able to 
eject razor sharp claws from his hands; and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young 
girl who can drain the life out of people and mutants just by touching them. 
Xavier has to determine which student Magneto is after and why before he can 
carry out his plans.
Guess what folks, that plot summary could have been even longer. Bryan 
Singer has managed to condense 38 years of X-men comics into one movie. I'd 
better warn you right now, if you didn't have a clue what I was talking 
about when you were reading that summary, avoid this movie because you are 
going to be completely lost. If the plot sounded interesting to you try to 
see the film with an X-men reader so they can explain things to you in 
advance. Okay, the rest of this review is directed entirely at those of you 
who would qualify as X-men fanatics (you know who you are, don't try to deny 
it). When I first saw the previews for this film several months back I was 
more than a little skeptical. In fact, the only thought that was running 
through my mind while I watched the preview was "Oh dear lord, what have 
they done?" To say I was pleasantly surprised by the final product would be 
an understatement. Bryan Singer has done a bang up job, creating a truly fun 
and exciting summer movie in a year full of dull, formulaic films. In fact, 
I haven't been to a summer movie that was this much fun since 1998's "The 
Mask of Zorro".
I know one of the largest concerns many X-men fans (myself included) had 
with the new movie was the casting of Australian actor Hugh Jackman as fan 
favorite Wolverine. The Wolverine seen in the comics stands a little over 
five feet tall, is built like a brick wall, and looks to be about forty five 
years old. Hugh Jackman is over six feet tall, is slender but muscular, and 
looks like he's in his early thirties. As it turns out this was one of the 
best casting choices in the movie. Not only is Jackman a great actor, but 
his appearance looks more threatening in real life than I think someone with 
the comic character's appearance would have. There are three other really 
great actors in "X-men", but I'll get to them in a minute. First I want to 
cover the minor characters. James Marsden ("Gossip") and Halle Berry 
("Bulworth") are both woefully miscast, though I'm not sure anyone could 
have played Cyclops in quite the right way. Tyler Mane (of professional 
wrestling fame) and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos ("Dirty Work") aren't required to 
act much, but they fit their parts quite nicely. Ray Park ("Star Wars: 
Episode One") hams it up something fierce as Toad, but he's obviously having 
such a good time that it's easy to forgive. Finally we have Bruce Davison 
("Apt Pupil") playing Senator Kelly in a nice, believable fashion. This 
character could have been over-played to the point of being ridiculous, 
yelling anti-mutant sentiments at the senate and behaving much like Hitler. 
Davison keeps his performance restrained and soft spoken, which makes us 
believe a person like this could still have power this day and age.
The three great performances come from Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next 
Generation), Ian McKellen ("Gods and Monsters"), and Anna Paquin ("The 
Piano"). I can't see anyone but Patrick Stewart playing the part of 
Professor Charles Xavier. Stewart has all the perfect attributes: the 
accent, the mannerisms, the soft-spoken nature, the kindly face, and (of 
course) the bald head. The only complaint I had with Xavier in the film is 
that he was sadly underused. While he shows up in the beginning to explain 
things to all the non-fans out there, he vanishes at about the midway point. 
Ian McKellen seemed like a poor choice for Magneto when I first heard about 
his casting. The comic version of Magneto is a big, hulking man in his early 
sixties who can control all metallic objects. Ian McKellen is obviously a 
little older than that and has a slender build. Fortunately McKellen is such 
a great actor that he easily makes up for his different physical attributes. 
Anna Paquin is another choice where fans thought Singer was out of his mind. 
The comic character of Rogue is a tall southern belle in her thirties. Anna 
Paquin is, well, Anna Paquin. Thankfully she delivers such a marvelous 
performance you'd swear she was born to play this role (I'm almost tempted 
to forgive her for "The Piano"). The Rogue character is one of the more 
complicated roles to play, being a girl who has no possible future with 
people since she can never be touched. Paquin plays the role beautifully, 
avoiding overacting when it would have been so easy to do.
So how does "X-men" fare in other areas besides acting and plot? Obviously 
one of the biggest draws is going to be the special effects, which are very 
well done. However, well done special effects are becoming more and more 
common place in Hollywood. The question then became whether Bryan Singer 
would use them wisely, and I'm pleased to say he did so. Singer keeps the 
effects so restrained that when he actually uses them they amaze the 
audience (as special effects are intended to do). The first time Storm 
really lets loose her powers in the movie I heard more gasps and cheers from 
people than I've heard about a movie in a long time (excluding "The 
Matrix"). The soundtrack to "X-men" is one of the low points, being seldom 
used and sadly inappropriate when present. Thankfully this is made up for by 
the great dialogue, which is a good thing because despite what the previews 
would have you believe, this is a dialogue driven movie. Wolverine gets some 
of the best lines, such as one in a scene where Xavier has just explained 
the mutant conflict and his school (and the whole plot actually), and 
Wolverine responds with: "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard." 
There's also a nice little jab at all the "X-men" fans who had criticized 
the film's costumes (I'm guilty of being one of them I'm afraid, but I've 
changed my mind since then). Wolverine taps his costume with disgust and 
asks "You guys always wear these?" Cyclops responds with "Well what would 
you prefer, yellow Spandex?" The movie runs a nice brisk 90 minutes, but as 
much as I love short movies, this one could have used a bit more time. 
Sometimes Singer's direction feels far too rushed, particularly when he's 
introducing the characters. I'd recommend "X-men" to fans of the comic and 
of comics in general, since no one else is going to follow the story too 
well. I give it a well earned four out of five stars.

     I think it's fair to say that I've been looking forward to a film
version of X-MEN for a while now -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 23
years, as a matter of fact. X-MEN #107 was one of the first comic books I
ever bought, and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that
abated only when, as a college student, I could no longer afford my habit. 
Some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an
adolescent fan-boy. Personally, I thought it would make me much tougher. 
After all, a 23-year wait can do something to one's expectations. I didn't
think I'd settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation
you almost never see: one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid
story.
     To my joy and astonishment, that's exactly what I got. X-MEN is not
just a great comic book movie; it's actually a pretty good movie _period_. 
For those unfamiliar with the source material, the X-Men are mutants --
humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty. 
Telepathic mutant Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has dedicated
himself to helping mutants learn to cope with their powers at his School
for Gifted Youngsters, mutants like retractable claw-wielding Wolverine
(Hugh Jackman) and a teenager called Rogue (Anna Paquin) who absorbs the
life force of people she touches. Xavier also has a powerful adversary in
Magneto (Ian McKellen), who sees mutants as destined for superiority, and
who believes the mass of humanity fears and hates mutant-kind. It seems
Magneto's perspective is justified when U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce
Davison) begins advocating for mutants to register with the government. 
And when Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants set in motion a plan to
mutate all of humanity, you can bet that a battle with Xavier's X-Men is
not far off.
     The X-Men universe has grown pretty unwieldy over the years, but
director Bryan Singer (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and his team of writers wisely
keep the focus on a limited number of characters: team leader Cyclops
(James Marsden), telekinetic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and weather
manipulator Storm (Halle Berry). Even more wisely, he focuses primarily on
Wolverine and his paternal relationship with the fragile, frightened 
Rogue. That choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor, it gives
plenty of screen time to X-MEN's most intriguing character and easily its
best performance. You've probably never seen Australian actor Hugh Jackman
before -- though he resembles a brawnier Gary Sinise -- but you will see
him again, because the guy has charisma to burn. Jackman offers everything
a fan could hope for in a portrayal of Wolverine, from the trademark
muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace. If X-MEN had
nothing else going for it but Jackman, it would still be worth seeing.
     The wonderful thing is that X-MEN _does_ have more going for it. 
Drawing on one of the comic's best stories of the 1980s, X-MEN effectively
uses the subtext of anti-mutant hysteria as a combination of Red scare
(there's a great moment in a Senate debate in which Kelly waves around a
"list of names of known mutants"), racism and homophobia. It offers dozens
of insider gags for the X-Men faithful, while avoiding the slavish
devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film story-telling. 
And, just in case it matters to anyone, it offers some of the
kick-ass-in'-est action scenes this side of THE MATRIX. The climactic
battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood -- including shape-shifter
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), tongue-flicker Toad (Ray Park) and
bone-crusher Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) -- is simply superb. The fact that
you don't have to wade through 90 minutes of junk to get to it is a
wonderful bonus.
     Of course X-MEN has its flaws. There's not much for Halle Berry to do
but look intense when her eyes go white, which is probably all for the
best given the Incredible Disappearing Accent she occasionally employs. 
The script also doesn't do quite enough with turning Magneto into a
genuinely tragic villain, especially given the amount of time devoted to
his back-story in the prologue. It's always tough for a film like X-MEN to
lay the foundation while still delivering the goods, so it's inevitable
that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends. I was startled,
however, by how few there were. Maybe my inner adolescent fan-boy did
emerge during X-MEN, but it emerged because the film reminded me of the
best the comic book had to offer, as well as some of the best an action
film can offer. I think it was worth the wait, though I have a sneaking
suspicion it won't be 23 years before the X-Men hit the screen again.

The most popular comic book characters since the 90's finally make their film 
debut the way you'd pretty
much expect it to be: assemble of familiar characters, a lot of cool 
superpowers and special effects and a
story about saving the world from a really evil villain and his nasty 
henchmen. 
Those expecting a lot of action will probably be dissapointed - there isn't a 
whole lot of comic book-style
violence and fighting going on here. Yes, there is a showdown between the 
good guys and the bad guys
but it's unoriginal, poorly directed and predictable. In effort to make a 
film like this appealing to the general
movie-going, non-comic book-reading public, the Hollywood hotshots made it a 
bit too tame. Maybe a
little Joel Schumacher "Batman"-style campiness would have made it more fun. 
A better screenplay would
have helped too, the entire story seems like a big prelude to nothing. 
Nevertheless, I'm sure kids will love the movie but it doesn't have that 
certain charm that will appeal to the
kid in us all... not all of us at least.

I was never a comic book fan, though as a child I was a casual reader of
such comics as Archie, Batman, and Superman. I have never read X-Men,
which was created in 1963, or for that matter too many other comic books
as an adult, and therefore do not view this $75 million special-effects
dominated film with the same reverence that an aficionado of such sci-fi
fantasy comics would. I'm just interested to see how Fox's new
comics-to-film adaptation presents itself, as I found very few such
projects turn out to be worthwhile films. The results here are only
tepid, as far as entertainment value goes.  Other than that, I had no
interest to see if the filmmaker made a travesty of the sacred comic
book, as I'm certain X-Men geeks will carefully scrutinize that aspect
of the film more than I will care to.
Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects"/"Apt Pupil") adapts the best-selling
Marvel comic books about a team of mutant heroes battling evil mutants
and human prejudice. It is a commercial film, geared to be a summer
blockbuster, also hoping to cash in on selling its merchandising wares
to its young fans, and cashing in down the road with a number of
sequels.
its realistic take on racism, and its moralistic displeasure at the
futility of world leaders to bring peace to the world. Its special
effects were, at times, dazzling, but I'm not partial to high tech films
without too much else going for it, especially for a superhero film that
seemed as awkward as this one was. I only ask: Why was the filmmaker so
sober-minded about filming this comic book story film?
It just never seemed to get much off the ground, except in its wise
casting decisions of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen
as Magneto, longtime friends who will oppose each other as mutants who
have a different take on the world. Their roles as hero and heavy (which
the producer/writer DeSanto says is based on Xavier as Martin Luther
King Jr. and Magneto as Malcolm X), become the glue that holds this
amorphous, sticky film together. What seems tiring about it, is all the
other characters in the film who are given quality time and end up just
showing us their supernatural gifts and Halloween-like costumes before
disappearing from any further characterizations. The story, before it
reached its action climax on the Statue of Liberty at Ellis Island,
where the world leaders are convening, hit a lot of tired spots, where
the movie seemed to be more or less a promo for more sequels than one
that could sustain its own story.
The premise of X-Men is -- that its heroes are mutants -- homo superior
beings -- the next evolutionary stage for human beings, who are
discriminated against because they're strange. A mutant is a superior
human being through the process of evolution, someone who is born with
superhuman powers --ex., telekinesis (the ability to move objects by
thought), telepathy (the ability to read minds), or the ability to fly.
The U.S. Government wants to have access to those who have an
"X-Factor," the DNA gene that holds the code that gives them mutant
powers.
Ultra-conservative Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) leads his shrill
charge against the mutants (reminiscent of the Senator McCarthy witch
hunt days) and wants to enact a Mutant Registration Act to register all
mutants so that the government could keep an eye on them. Arguing
against this on the floor of the Senate, is Dr. Jean Grey (Famke), one
of the good mutants, someone who has strong telepathic and telekinetic
powers: She can lift a tank by concentrating on it. She is part of the
wheelchair bound Professor Charles Xavier's group, that fights for the
civil rights of the mutants. Xavier is in charge of a Westchester, New
York-based School for Gifted Youngsters, which is also a front for the
superhuman threats. He has a dream that some day he can live in a world
where mutants and humans coexist in peace, he even wants peace with
Magneto, the main enemy to his group. Magneto is a best friend of
Xavier's who has turned arch-enemy. He is the only other person in the
world who shares the same supernatural powers (you could see the analogy
drawn between the Bible's Devil and God).
The plot of the film is simply to see how Xavier's team stops Magneto's
evil team from destroying the world.
Xavier might be the most powerful mutant on Earth. He not only can read
thoughts, but he can project his thoughts into others. He can also alter
and erase memories. With Magneto's help, he created a device called the
Cerebo, which can amplify his mental powers, so he can detect and find a
mutant anywhere in the world. He directs these powers only for the good
of mankind.
Magneto is a survivor of Poland's Auschwitz in 1944, where he has
witnessed so much  human tragedy and now his specific goal is revenge
against anti-mutant bigots, whose better type of hatred elevates him
above the ordinary movie villain. He has formed a Brotherhood of Evil
Mutants to take over the world and is willing to kill anyone to achieve
his goal. His motto is: "by any means necessary." By going out of
control, he moves beyond the pale of goodness and becomes as dangerous
as the enemies he is going after.
For most of the film, we are introduced to the opposing sides of this
good versus evil duel.
On Magneto's side are Mystique (Romijn-Stamos). She's a human chameleon;
she can transform herself into the likeness of any person, despite her
blue skin and red hair. She also possesses superior martial-arts skills.
Toad (Ray Park) is one of the original evil mutants of Magneto's. He can
scale walls and has a 12-foot projectile tongue. He's a regular ass
kicker and tongue-flinging psychopath. Sabertooth (Tyler
Moore-six-feet-ten-inch, 275-pound former wrestler with the WWF) has
similar powers to the hero of the story Wolverine (Hugh
Jackman-Australian). He has healing powers and heightened senses. He is
the scariest of the villains, with a blood lust equal to that of a
vampire. He is extremely athletic and has razor-sharp claws, and loves
to kill.
On Xavier's team, Cyclops (Marsden) is the first recruit. He doesn't
smoke, drink, or curse. He unfurls from his eyes thunderbolts of energy,
which can kill and penetrate steel, and he has to wear a wraparound
ruby-red-quartz visor to keep those rays in check. Storm (Halle Berry)
can control the weather. She can shoot lightning bolts from her hands.
She also dons a stunning platinum wig. Wolverine is a hothead, a loner,
and the existential hero of this film. He suffers because he can't even
remember his family name. He is a difficult person to come to grips with
because of his bellicose nature. He can heal himself from almost any
mortal injury, has heightened senses, is superstrong, and his bones are
composed of an unbreakable metal called adamantum. His claws project out
rapidly from his knuckles and can cut through almost anything. By his
sense of smell, he can tell where someone stood in a room, even days
later. Rogue (Paquin) is a teenager who can touch someone and absorb all
their memories and abilities and their personality. She discovers the
gift she has, when she kisses a boy and puts him in a coma for three
months. There is also a minor role for Iceman (Bobby Drake), he is one
of the gifted school children, who when he speaks, small amounts of
frost emanate from his mouth.
The comic book's loyal followers might want to know: Will Wolverine ever
recall his heritage? Will Rogue recover her full powers? Will the X-Men
continue to share Xavier's vision for a harmonious world?
It is obvious that Singer developed a love for this comic book story and
its mutants, but he failed to distance himself from it and ended up with
a ponderous, uninteresting film, that failed to get to the heart of any
character in the story, and left the story hanging by its special
effects, which made the film seem dried out long before its action
scenes took hold. It was only mildly diverting as far as entertainment
value and that is because of the welcomed hammy performances by Stewart
and McKellen. I'm sure that regular fans of the comic book will find
some inside jokes in the film to laugh at, but I just tended to grow
weary of the effort and was not converted to the X-Men project. The film
needed a healthy share of irreverence to rev me up for all this
righteously moralistic stuff it lays on you.

 Based on the best-selling comic books, this live-action
allegory about persecution and tolerance revolves around an awesome
team of black leather-clad mutants who become reluctant
superheroes. For the X-uninitiated, wheelchair-bound Prof. Charles
Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the world's greatest telepath who runs a
secret school where gifted youngsters are taught by Storm (Halle
Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke
Janssen). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the
newcomers. The adversarial evil Brotherhood - Sabretooth (Tyler Mane),
Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos), Toad (Ray Park) - is led by the
strongest and most powerful mutant ever known, Magneto (Ian McKellen),
who captures a conservative U.S. Senator (Bruce Davison) in his
determination to get respect by whatever means necessary. Director
Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects," "Apt Pupil") enjoys dark character
studies, keeping the comic-book action taut. And he's obviously been
influenced by "Matrix" effects.  The Cerebro, a chamber in which
Xavier's psychic abilities are enhanced, is fascinating, as is
Magneto's Lair and the Map Room, where a six-foot diameter table made
of steel pins rises to form a 3-D topographical map of New York
City. The Rogue Effect, which drains a person's life-force, is
impressive and there's an incredible, high-energy, destructive
sequence at the Statue of Liberty. With her scaly blue skin and red
hair, Mystique is eye-candy as a shape-shifter, transforming herself,
including fingerprints and voice, into anyone with whom she comes in
contact. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "X-Men" is a cool,
mythic 7. Die-hard Marvel Comic fanatics may quibble with these movie
mutants but fans are out there and they will come.

Director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") takes on a task that has had fans
of The X-Men comics frothing at the mouth for years - bringing their beloved
super heroes to the big screen. This daunting mission, with its many special
effects and giant budget, is now finished and the talented helmer has succeeded
in bringing the comic characters to life for both fans and newcomers alike in
"X-Men."
Every few millennia, man undergoes certain changes, or mutations, that help
humankind to evolve into the next level of being. But, when these mutations
occur, the current residents of Earth fear the changes and strike out at the
mutants. Now, the world is in the midst of another round of mutations and the
'normal' humans, led by firebrand Senator Kelly (John Davison), want a final
solution for the problem. The senator and his followers do not want the
mutants, called X-Men, to roam free and a new Holocaust is brewing.
Psychic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) heads a government program
that trains and educates the next generation of mankind, nurturing his wards to
develop the various changes they are undergoing. He also leads the X-Men,
good-guy mutants who use their power to protect Earth from the evil Magneto
(Ian McKellen). Magneto is a magnetically charged tyrant mutant who wants to 
take over the world for his own selfish purposes. The only thing standing 
between him and world domination is Xavier and his X-Men.
The professor is joined in the battle by his protigi of psychic power, Dr. Jean
Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and the laser-eyed Cyclops (James
Marsden) in his quest to defeat the wicked plans of Magneto. The good guys are
well matched by the evil boss's minion - the shape shifting Mystique (Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos), the agile Toad (Ray Park, "Star Wars: Episode One") and the
powerful and mean Sabretooth (Tyler Mane). Thrown into the mix of this looming
battle is a surgically altered mutant and loner named Logan (Hugh Jackman).
Both sides vie for the loyalty of the battler, who also goes by the moniker
Wolverine, as Magneto hatches a plot to mutate the entire membership of the
United Nations and take over the world.
Director Singer walks a very fine line in this adaptation of the nearly four
decade old Marvel comic book series. The trick in adapting such fan-dedicated
source material to a feature film lay in appealing to an audience that is not
exclusively made up of just the fan base. A recent example of the difficulty of
maintaining such a balance can be seen in the 1997 sci-fi film, "Spawn."  That
actioner went under the assumption that catering to the fans, alone, was enough
to generate substantial box office bucks. It wasn't and the film didn't do as
well as its producers had hoped.
Singer strikes a balance for the fan and non-fan that does two things. The
newcomer to this potential film franchise is fed enough background information
so that there is a basic understanding of what "X-Men" is all about. The
makers don't dwell on the education process for the novice viewer, providing
the gist of the material needed to move things along. It gets down to business 
once the viewer is told, basically, that stuff happens - people mutate.
When the story kicks in, the characters are introduced with little fanfare as
the individual powers of each are explained or displayed. This is where the
copious special F/X kick in and the super powers of Storm, Cyclops, Toad and
the rest are displayed with all kinds of flash and smoke. Not a lot of time is
spent on character development, but the crew of talented actors help flesh out 
their assignments, in some cases quite well.
Much of the focus of the story is on Logan. He's a sullen loner, a mutant who
was altered to accommodate a super strong skeletal frame. He can also thrust
saber-like blades from his hands and has astonishing healing powers. The
Wolverine takes on the task of protecting a young mutant named Rogue (Anna
Paquin). Rogue is pivotal in Magneto's plans and it's up to Logan and the rest
to stop him. Hugh Jackman gives dimension to his super hero performance with his
dark wit and brooding demeanor. Of course, his hairdo and mutton chop sideburns
help lend to his Wolverine image, too.
The rest of the cast, led by Patrick Stewart, fare unevenly. Stewart is his
usual stalwart self and is made for the role of Charles Xavier. He exudes
leadership quality and kindness as he guides his X-Men into battle. Ian
McKellen looks good as chief bad guy Magneto, but his evilness is not bad ass 
enough.  Halle Berry, as stormy Storm, gets few lines and isn't allowed to 
break out the F/X laden character who can conjure up a tempest at the drop of 
a hat. Famke Janssen has a nice presence as Jean Grey, though her telekinetic 
powers are no where near as flashy as the others' are.  Anna Paquin is bland 
and emotionless as Rogue, who can suck the life from a person. Paquin's 
performance does much the same to the character. Romijn-Stamos puts it on the 
line as the shape-shifting Mystique, undergoing grueling makeup prep for many 
hours each day. It pays off as the former model's lithe gracefulness fits the 
sexy, somewhat reptilian character that can become an identical copy of whoever 
she wants. Ray Parks provides terrific athletic ability as the super tongued 
Toad.
The production befits the material. If you expect flashy F/X, you get 'em here.
Each of the X-Men has a unique power and the effects team does a solid job of
making each special. Costuming takes a real departure from the colorful dress
of the comics, replacing colors with sleek black uniforms. The stylish set 
designs give the film a stunning look - make note of the futuristic prison 
setting - that suits the comic book feel of the film. There is also some nice 
homage to such classic films as "Forbidden Planet" and, with a battle royale 
atop the Statue of Liberty, Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur."
As expected, the film ends with a couple of set ups that are, undoubtedly,
intended as the basis for the X-Men franchise. There are two more films in
development and the material should flow quite easily for the sequels. The deft
way that Singer and company have transferred the action comics to the big
screen reps one of the best efforts since "Superman II" and will win some new 
fans.  Older auds may not be too taken by "X-Men," but the demographic it aims 
at hits the bull's-eye. I give it a B.
Director Bryan Singer, who last cast Ian McKellen as a Nazi war criminal
in "Apt Pupil," begins his comic superhero movie "X-Men" with McKellen's
character of Magneto as a victim of his former self, establishing his
metal bending powers as his parents are herded into a gated Jewish ghetto.  
This backstory also signals what's good about the X-Men tale - the bad
guy isn't simply evil for badness' sake but fears persecution for his
difference, while the good guys, led by Patrick Stewart's telepathic Professor
X, protect a human race that often acts reprehensibly.  This is no simple
morality play.
The story (story by Tom DeSanto and Bryan Singer, screenplay by David Hayter)
very effectively sets up the world of X-Men even for those like myself who
have no familiarity with the comicbook series.  In a near future Senator Robert 
Jefferson Kelly (Bruce Davison, "Longtime Companion") is fighting for
legislation that would require mutants to be 'outed' because of their 
potential danger to humans.  In response, Magneto and his camp (wrestler
Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, swimsuit model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique
and Phantom Menacer Ray Park as Toad) wants to take over the world and
plans to begin by using the life force powers of Rogue ("The Piano's" eleven
year old Oscar winner Anna Paquin, now an adolescent) to juice a machine
in the Statue of Liberty which will irradiate the entire population of New 
York City, killing Rogue in the process.  
The real star of this ensemble piece is Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman's
Wolverine, a conflicted loner with heightened senses and the ability to
shoot longer razor claws out of his knuckles (he resembles Quentin from
the old 70's gothic soap "Dark Shadows").  When Rogue runs away from home
after putting the first boy she's kissed into a coma, she recognizes Wolverine 
as a fellow mutant in a smoky bar and becomes his protegee.  When they're 
attacked on the road by Sabretooth, they're aided by Cyclops (James Marsden, 
"Gossip") and Storm (Halle Berry) and whisked away to Professor X's school for 
mutants.  Rogue does well, but Wolverine still bristles, loner that he is, 
even as he falls for Cyclops' girlfriend, Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen, 
"Rounders"), setting up a nice overlapping love triangle as Rogue develops a 
crush on the wolfman.  The Wolverine/Cyclops friction opens the door for some
refreshing humor to lighten the dark film.
"X-Men" is story and character driven, yet it does feature some fine
fight scenes, where Ray Park and Romijn-Stamos really shine.  Toad scrambles
across ceilings and flicks a grossly extended tongue while Mystique
flexes her perfect bod attired in nothing but blue paint and scales (which
required fifteen hours a day to put on and remove!).  Jackman (who replaced
Dougray Scott when M:I-2's shooting schedule ran over) will surely become
a star with this vehicle, although not all the oddly-assembled cast fare 
as well.  The bad X-Men have practically zilch in the way of dialogue
except for Magneto and the Oscar-nominated McKellen is a little bland in the
role.  On the flip side, Patrick Stewart seems born to play the
wheelchair-bound Professor X and former friend of Magneto (they still enjoy
a good game of chess).  Janssen is an appropriately sensitive Gray and
Marsden portrays Cyclops as a gung-ho hotshot, but Berry does little more
than look cool with her white hair and black cape while Paquin is stuck in
the victim role.  Davison is sleezy as the rabble rousing Senator who
meets a spectacularly inventive demise.
Special effects range all over the map from cheesy lightening bolts to
rather cool stepping slates that appear in front of Magneto as he walks
through mid air.  Cinematographer Tom Sigel, who brought such a unique
look to "Three Kings," does little to distinguish himself here, with the
overall look of the film being too dark.  Claustrophobic sets (Production 
Design by John Myhre, Art Direction by Paul D. Austerberry, Tamara Deverell
and Rando Schmook) also give the film a low rent feel.  Hopefully the
sequels will be brightened up and opened out.  Costume design (Louise 
Mingenbach, Bob Ringwood) is pedestrian while Makeup (Ann Brodie) is
outstanding.
Far more serious than the ragtag "Mystery Men," "X-Men" are like 
live action "Pokemon" for adults.  This franchise seems destined to
outlive the superhero series that came before.

 X-Men (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman,
Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin,
Tyler Mane, Ray Park, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Bruce Davison. Directed
by Bryan Singer. Story by Tom DeSanto and Singer. Screenplay by David
Hayter. Music by Michael Kamen. Rated PG-13.
 The X-Men are not your normal kind of super heroes.
 No, not because they are mutants. In a sense all comic book heroes who
possess one extraordinary power or another is a mutant.
 It's because these men and women are like us; they have issues, they
squabble and sometimes get on each other's nerves.
 And that is one of the charms of "X-Men," the long-anticipated movie
adaptation of one of Marvel Comics most popular franchises.
 "X-Men" is a story of tolerance vs. intolerance, with echoes reaching
back to the Nazis' `final solution.'
  "X-Men" is set in the undefined, not-too-distant future. There is a
growing concern and paranoia in the United States, led by demagogue Sen.
Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) about the threat from mutants, people who
are freaks of nature, scientific oddities. Kelly is pushing legislation
making it mandatory that these people be registered.
 In the background, quietly opposing Kelly are two camps. One is led by
Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most powerful
telepath, who runs a school for `gifted' students where they are taught
to control their powers and use them for good.
Xavier fights to protect the very people who hate and fear him and his
kind.
 The other faction is run by Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto (Ian
McKellen). His answer is, if you can't lick em, join em. He and his
evil Brotherhood of Mutants, devise a diabolical plan that would force
humanity to accept them.
 Director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects," "Apt Pupil"), who co-wrote
the story with Tom DeSanto, as well as screenwriter David Hayter, have
created a balanced plot that is equal special effects-mutant-vs.-mutant
WWF, knock-down-drag-'em-out battles, coupled with a human element, as
these gifted people learn to cope and accept their strange powers.
 First, a mini-scorecard for those unfamiliar with X-Men, so you can
learn the various players.
 The good guys, those aligned with Professor X, include: Cyclops, whose
eyes emit powerful energy beams; Storm, who can manipulate the weather;
and Jean Gray, a telepath who also has telekinetic powers.
 Joining them are Wolverine, the surly loner with adamantium claws and
amazing healing powers who would rather fight than talk, and Rogue, a
sensitive teen-age girl who can absorb the powers and memories of anyone
she touches.
 Opposing them is Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants, which includes the
animalistic Sabertooth; the blue-skinned metamorph Mystique and the
far-jumping, tongue-lashing Toad.
 "X-Men" features a wry sense of humor. As the X-Men move out dressed in
their black, all-leather uniforms for their final confrontation with
their foes, Wolverine asks if they really wear these clothes in public.
To which Cyclops replies, `What would you prefer, yellow Spandex?'
 Then there's the throw-away scene at Professor X's school in which we
see a group of youngsters playing basketball. One young lad with super
speed continually passes the ball to himself, making an easy lay-up. An
off-screen voice protests: `Hey, no fair, no superpowers allowed.'
I
 t's moments like these that confirm that Singer and his writers have
gotten it right. There's is one of the best comic book adaptations since
Tim Burton's original "Batman" movie.
 The "X-Men" cast: Stewart is wise, gentle and authoritative as the
fatherly leader of this band of outsiders.
 Hugh Jackman, another Australian hunk in the Russell Crowe mode, is
tenacious, tough and a bit tender as the ferocious Wolverine.
 James Marsden plays Cyclops with a cool nonchalance and a quick sense
of humor.
 Halle Berry is beautiful and tough as the no-nonsense Storm, while the
lovely Famke Janssen displays a firmness, dedication and intelligence as
Jean Gray.
 Oscar-winner Anna Paquin ("The Piano") is vulnerable and
psychologically scarred as the alienated and confused Rogue.
 The movie's one drawback is that the villainous mutants are not as
fully developed as their heroic counterparts. Thus, Tyler Mane mainly
roars and rends as Sabertooth; Rebecca Romjin-Stamos shape shifts as
Mystique, while Ray Park as Toad, gets to cut a wisecrack or two.
 Only Ian McKellen as Magneto is drawn with any depth. His contempt for
humanity is understandable. He does what he feels is necessary not for
any really evil purpose, but as a method of survival.
 "X-Men" will prove to be a hit, opening the door for a sequel or two or
three. Despite my cynicism about sequels, I wouldn't mind watching the
future adventures of these interesting heroes, if the writing is as
intelligent and sharp as this introductory adventure.
 You need not be a comic book aficionado to enjoy "X-Men." It features
great visuals, an appropriate Michael Kamen score, lots of action and -
most of all - very interesting characters.
 "X-Men" creator Stan Lee should be proud. His concept has been
successfully transferred from printed page to big screen with very few
compromises.

Let me just say right off the bat that the closest I ever got to "X-Men"
comics was [I can't believe I'm confessing this] when I used to read
"Betty And Veronica"; that, and watching my sons play the "X-Men" arcade
game.  I had a passing knowledge of the basic idea of the
Super(anti)Heroes, but not much more than your average Chick.  Suffice
it to say, except for my ongoing Beef that Angela "Born To Be 'Storm'"
Bassett wasn't in it, I went into this flick with a clean slate, not
quite knowing what to expect.
And while I didn't come out with nearly the "wow" feeling that I had
from a similar-in-spirit flick - 1999's THE MATRIX - I can honestly say
that X-MEN was a damned sight better than most of the live-action
remakes of cartoons and comics I've had the sorry "pleasure" to witness
[cf BATMAN AND ROBIN and ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE].  Heck, I can say more
than that: I actually liked X-MEN.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
In the not-too-distant future, genetically-altered mutants will become a
"forward leap" in mankind's evolution.  And, as has been proven in
mankind's past dealings with those seen as Different, that evolution
will be feared - possibly to the point of extinction.
As an orphaned survivor of the Holocaust in Poland, Magneto (Sir Ian
McKellen) has no intention of being vulnerable to the whims of mortal
men again.  Using his powers of literal magnetism, he gathers other
mutants of similar mind - including super-strong Sabretooth (the
aptly-named Tyler Mane); the flexible (of tongue and limb) Toad (Ray
Park); and shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) - to gain the
upper hand on normal humans before McCarthy-ite Senator Kelly (Bruce
Davison) and his ilk try to legislate the mutants out of existence.
But Magneto and the Bad Mutants have to contend with the X-Men:
Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a loner whose whole body is his weapon; Rogue
(Anna Paquin), a sensitive teen whose mere touch can bring death;
Cyclops (James Marsden), whose unshielded eyes have the same effect as
Rogue's touch; Storm (Halle Berry), who can control weather in powerful
ways; Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has the gifts of telepathy and
telemetry; and their leader, super-psychic Professor Charles Xavier
(Patrick Stewart).  Despite their ability to cause mutants permanent
grief, Prof. X still believes in the basic goodness of human beings, and
brings in young and old mutants into his School For The Gifted to teach
them how to Use Their Powers For Good, to best serve humanity.
The Upshot:
The best compliments I can pay to X-MEN are that it did not get
overwhelmed by its (pretty decent) special effects, and that it provided
a good (without being condescending) introduction to a world formerly
known only to fans of the comic books, and to a lesser extent, the video
games.  Not being plugged in to either of those pasttimes, I cannot say
with any authority whether it was a completely valid introduction, but,
as I mentioned earlier, I've seen much, much worse.  I can dig this one.
Effects-wise, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be; once you get
past their basic powers - Sabertooth's Bigness, Cyclops' fire-shooting
eyes, and Wolverine's claws - the thrill is gone.  I had high hopes of
seeing Something Special from Storm, but was let down there, too.  In
fact, the most impressive part of the flick was Cyclops' motorcycle
[yes, I know: spoken as a true gearhead].  Still, Mystique was true to
form [uh, no pun intended], and Toad was someone I'd Like To Get To Know
Better...if you know what I mean [And I Think That You Do].
performances of its cast; wherever the writing and direction went
lacking (and it was, in quite a few places; it wasn't until more than
halfway through the movie, for instance, that X-MEN seemed to recognize
the potential humor in Wolverine's and Cyclops' pissing contest), the
actors came through with better-than-expected, honest depictions of
their comic-book characters.  It would've been all too easy to play it
for camp, or go the "Batman" route with overly-maudlin performances; to
their credit, this mostly-unglittery (with obvious exceptions) cast
played it straight without being stodgy or overblown.
This first in an apparent series (that "ending" was anything but) was
obviously Wolverine and Rogue's story, and actors Jackman and Paquin had
the lion's share of the lines and action.  They did well, as did Stewart
as the hopeful Professor X and McKellen as the very bitter Magneto.
Most of the rest of the players were there in truly supporting roles,
whether limited by their own acting abilities (most notably Berry as
Storm; I'll get to her later) or by the necessity of their character's
limited movements (I felt bad for Tyler Mane; after all, what can a big
Sabretooth do but roar excessively?)  Ray Park, though, Worked It as
Toad; by far my favorite mutant, he turned Being Bad into an art form.
Bru'man most def had an Evil Tigger quality about him.
Having said all that, while I did enjoy the movie, I walked away feeling
somewhat unsatisfied, and with more questions than answers.  Probably
much to the delight of the filmmakers, who've set this up as a
"Batman"-like franchise.  One can only hope X-MEN as a series has more
staying power.  And, hopefully for the follow-up flick, a stronger
ending.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Another disclaimer: it's no secret that I don't hold a lot of stock in
Halle Berry's acting abilities, and that I would've much preferred
Angela Bassett in this role [dammit, she really was Born To Be Storm.
grumble.]  Even with that bias, though, I really did try to give Berry
the benefit of the doubt.  She almost had me on her side; her character
not having a whole lot to do but speak her limited lines with a weirdly
affected accent, I could've lived with her just Standing There, Being
Pretty.
And then she had to ruin my illusions with a Keanu Moment (SMALL SPOILER
AHEAD): "You know what happens when a toad gets hit by lightning?  Same
thing as what happens to everything else."  (END SPOILER)
Hmm...is it too late to suggest Grace Jones for the next flick?
Bammer's Bottom Line:
It ain't rocket science [hmmm...actually, in this case, it might just
be] but X-MEN was a good fun romp for an hour or two; certainly, as a
direct-from-the-comics flick, it ran circles around TEENAGE NINJA MUTANT
TURTLES. Not that that'd be all that big a circle to start with...
I'll be impressed when they add the Computer Geek Mutant.

One of my most cherished possessions to this day remains the NM (Near Mint)
copy of X-Men#4, for which I overpaid about a decade ago (according to my
dad), but which today, makes me look like a friggin' financial genius! I
love comic books. I've got about a thousand of them locked up in my
basement, and some of my nicest memories from the days o' puberty, are of me
nestled up in a corner with a copy of the early B&W Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles or the original Judge Dredd comics nestled in my lap. Sure, I
haven't read them in a while, but I know they're there, and one day...I will
go back.
Having said all that, I never really got into the X-Men comics. Not because
I didn't like them or anything, I just never got around to them. Spidey,
Batman, Punisher were always so much cooler. And the movie, you say? Well,
that's another story.
PLOT:
This film is set in the near future, a time during which mutant humans are
running rampant among us. These special people each have their own
particular powers distinguishing themselves from each other and the rest of
society. The human race is not sure how to deal with these hybrid beings,
and is considering certain policies regarding their governance. The good
mutants are trying to work with the humans, while the bad mutants are just
pissed. Clashes ensue.
CRITIQUE:
A good beginning to a possible franchise property, this film gives us a good
chunk of background on the characters, tosses in a few exciting fight
sequences, cool special effects and the other bad mutha of the summer:
Wolverine! Was this a great film? No. Was this a bad film? No way. It was
good. It did what it needed to do, and that was to entertain me for an hour
and a half, present me with many interesting and unique characters, sprinkle
in some moments of levity and color me comic-ally entertained. Add all that
to the tight tops on the mutant girls and I personally consider this to be a
very welcome start to the latest comic book gone Hollywood. And did the
majority of the characters win me over in the end? You bet your X they did!
Of course, everyone and their uncle is gonna have a favorite and not-so by
next week, so let's see which ones appealed to me. I really loved Wolverine
the most, dug Professor X and Rogue, especially the performances set forth
by Patrick Stewart and Anna Paquin, but not much else on the "good" mutants
front. Didn't much care for Storm or Halle Berry's "now-you-hear-it
now-you-don't" Jamaican accent, nor the jawline presented to us by Cyclops,
although the banter between him and Wolvie did hit the mark.
The biggest problem that I did have with the film, or any of its characters
for that matter, was the fact that the "bad guy", the main man leading this
mutant revolution against the humans was...well, how could I put it, an old
man! I'm not exactly sure if the character of Magneto was so old in the
comic books, but even if he was, the sight of Ian McKellen flying around in
those tights and helmet just didn't do it for me. I wish they would have
picked a more intimidating foe. That aside, I loved the character of Toad
and his long, twisty tongue, Mystique and her ultra-cool powers a la
chameleon and even Sabretooth, despite his feeble-mindedness. The special
effects were also all very well presented and even more importantly, not
overplayed. A little more action would have been appreciated, especially
during the film's first 20 minutes or so, but I suppose the film's final 20
clicks kinda make up for all that. And keep your eyes peeled for one of the
cooler fight sequences of the year, with Mystique and Wolverine going all
out near the tail-end of this thing. Kicking all kinds of ass with two very
cool characters turning in one very slick battle! In fact, I haven't said
enough about Wolverine. He is all over this movie, he's the loner, the
outsider, the drinker, the guy who doesn't need help from anyone, but gets
the looks from the girls and has a tender heart deep down inside. Hugh
Jackman does an excellent job as Wolvie and gives you just enough juice to
pepper up the rest of the good mutants and their ho-hum ways.
And remember that you don't need to have read the comic book or even known
anything about the X-Men before this film to really appreciate this movie as
the solid, comic book adventure that it is. It's a fun, summer romp. Real
fans will likely get a little more out of it, especially with the couple of
in-jokes tossed in and around. All in all, the film does leave you wanting
more and I guess that for the first of a possible many others...that's the
best that we could ask for. And oh yeah...Wolvie rules!
