JULIEN DONKEY-BOY (director/writer: Harmony Korine; cinematographer:
Anthony Dod Mantle; editor: Valdis Oskarsdottir; cast: Ewen Bremner
(Julien), Chloe Sevigny (Pearl), Evan Neumann (Chris), Werner Herzog
(father), Joyce Korine (Grandma), Chrissy Kobylak (Chrissy), Alvin Law
(Neighbor); Runtime: 101; Fine Line Features / Independent Pictures
Production; 1999)
Writer-director Harmony Korine (Gummo), the former skateboarder who
wrote the screenplay for Kids, likes to do his own thing in films. His
auteur signature is to create shocking scenes and characters who will
try to freak the audience out. This in-your-face film is about attitude.
I can't say that I enjoyed it, or found it interesting, but I can say
that I found it different...and, it didn't box me in as to how I was to
view the characters, letting me make up my own mind as to how I wanted
to feel about them. Yet Korine didn't seem to trust all this poetry he
was spreading about and needs to end the film in a conventional way,
with a dramatic scene regarding the pregnancy of Chloe Sevigny.
Korine shot it on digital video and transferred it to film according to
the rules of Dogma 95.
The film is an anti-narrative and linear work. It sets its sights on a
dysfunctional family, living together in Queens, by following them
around to see their everyday existence, while encouraging impromptu
situations and dialogue. Julien (Ewen Bremner) is a mentally unbalanced
21-year-old , who has conversations with himself often repeating what he
says while his arms are flailing. There is an amusing sketch with him
having an imaginary conversation with his houseguest Adolph Hitler. He
is prone to babbling, drooling, and acting outrageous in a harmless way.
He also has some nifty gold false teeth he takes in-and-out of his
mouth. His ballerina and pirouetting ice-skating sister Pearl (Chloe
Sevigny-the real-life girlfriend of Korine) is seven months pregnant
with julien's child. She will call julien from one of the rooms in their
middle-class two-story brickhouse, pretending to be his dead mother,
offering him words of love and comfort. His abusive father (Werner
Herzog-German experimental director) has a few screws loose himself and
tries to be the disciplinarian in the family when he isn't wearing his
gas mask and listening to bluegrass music, or drinking cough medicine
from a slipper. He forces julien to be hosed down in cold water -- which
he does because he wants his son to act like a man -- telling him a
winner doesn't shiver. The most sane one in the household is the high
school student brother of julien's, Chris (Evan Neumann), who is not
overflowing with brains. He is a physical fitness nut and is seen in one
scene wrestling with julien, and from time to time he is seen doing a
weird work-out routine, whereby he climbs the stairs by using only his
upper body. He also is subject to his father's drunken discipline and
miserly love, as are the other children.
A host of characters infiltrate the film for some quick laughs, but, as
odd as they were, they seemed like the type of people the family members
would be acquainted with, so the scenes with them didn't appear to be as
much a freak show as it was a way to make the film entertaining. But the
problem was, they didn't go with the flow of the film, as their
eccentric behavior seemed forced. Some of them include a handless man
who does card tricks and plays the drums with his feet; some blind and
retarded youngsters from the school julien works at, whom he hangs out
with at a bowling alley and they are seen as spastics to be laughed at;
a black albino rapper from Alabama ranting about doing your thing; and,
there is a wonderful scene, with julien and his family at a Pentecostal
church, getting into the Jesus thing Southern style, with julien having
a tear roll down his face while into jumping up and down like the
emotional minister and the black congregation.
In the film's most dramatic moment, towards the end of the movie, Pearl
trips while at an ice rink and has a miscarriage. Julien goes to the
hospital and steals the dead fetus, taking it home on the bus and
cuddling up with it under the covers when in his bed.
I appreciate the effort for originality attempted here, especially with
the abundance of formula mainstream and indie films pushed at the
public, but I would like to see something more intellectually demanding
than just a rant against conventional filmmaking. The filmmaking skills
are there, but as of yet, I don't see the 25-year-old director moving
too far from the childish shock scenes he threw at the audience for his
first film. Mr. Korine dedicated this film to his Uncle Eddie, a patient
at the Creedmore Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, and the film's
central character julien is a schizophrenic modeled in a loving way
after his uncle. I'm sure the director meant well by this
characterization and that is not where I have difficulty with this film,
my difficulty is that the novelty of hearing the incomprehensible
chatter of julien soon wore off and the film seemed to grow vacuous and
became more a technical film addressing how Korine can fool those Dogma
95 people by putting in shots with artificial light, which he did
numerous times, by breaking the rules he promised to fulfill when
getting his Dogma 95 certificate, then it was a film about ideas. I
would much rather he had made a more substantial film rather than making
another anti-intellectual indie film, mainly showing off his superior
knowledge of digital video techniques...but offering no real insights
into the mentally unbalanced characters deeper than what is seen on the
surface. There is still too much skateboarder braggadocio in him and not
enough filmmaker...but the future holds a lot of promise for this
talented filmmaker.

Schizophrenia is a mental illness where the patient often perceives a
reality that is markedly different from what a normal mind would
perceive. Portrayal of mental illness is often given from the
perspective of the sane observer viewing the puzzling behavior of the
afflicted. This film takes the opposite approach, with the audience
viewing a confusing, incomprehensible world through the eyes of the
protagonist.
This story does not contain a clear narrative, but rather is a
composition of various scenes and occurrences in the life of the main
character, Julien (Ewen Bremner). He lives with his widowed father
(legendary German director, Werner Herzog), and his two siblings,
pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny) and brother Chris (Evan
Neumann). Both of Julien's siblings appear to be normal, and all of
their behavior seems coherent. Julien's father comes across as an odd
character, but perhaps it is only Julien's perception of him that is
askew.
The events that take place in the household span the range from
mundane to bizarre. Chris, perhaps the most "normal" character, is
constantly practicing wrestling. Pearl shops for baby clothes,
tenderly cares for Julien, and plays the harp. Julien's father
delivers monologues about various topics, ranging from the dialog in
the movie Dirty Harry, to a talking bird competition. He sometimes
watches television while wearing a gas mask. All these factors seem
meaningless in isolation, but form a rough mosaic in composition.
The most bizarre and disturbing elements of the film occur when Julien
is followed. He engages in behaviors that are typical of people with
his mental illness, like raving at pedestrians, and emotional
immersion in religion and religious imagery. At times however, Julien
appears mostly normal, such as the scenes where he is attending a
school for other disabled persons. A friend of Julien's at the school,
a young girl with impaired vision, makes the statement that she had
always thought her vision was normal until she was told that "normal"
people can see much more clearly than she could. This is the key
insight the film makes into Julien's world. What may be disturbing and
unintelligible to the viewer, is normalcy for the schizophrenic mind.
Very few of the events that occur are coherent in the context of a
story. The initial scene presents extreme actions and imagery that jar
the viewer but does not seem connected to the following narrative.
Immediately the viewer is undecided whether what was presented were
real or imagined actions. The intention is clearly to present a world
where reality and illusion and hallucination combine to form the
sensorially riotous world of the schizophrenic. Director Harmony
Korine wrote the story which was inspired by his real life uncle who
suffers from the disease.
The film adheres to the tenets of Dogme 95, an austere school of
filmmaking that eschews many of the superficial or manipulative
aspects of modern filmmaking. For example, Dogme 95 films are shot on
location without sets or props, sound is recorded from source and not
redubbed, the camera is hand-held, etc. All of these techniques also
reflect the scattered and impressionistic nature of Julien's mind.
Much of the acting was improvised, and some of the footage was taken
as the actors, staying in their roles, interacted with real people on
location.
The film will definitely not play in multiplexes as it does not have
an audience there. It will likely have a limited run on the art house
circuit, but still struggle to attract viewers to such a detached,
abstract, and difficult film. As a portrait of schizophrenia, the film
immerses the viewer into a world of altered reality. There is a
threadbare narrative at its core, but the film is mostly a collage of
disjointed scenes, images, and experiences. The characters are left
vague and are not possible to identify with.
Conditionally recommended. The film is highly ambitious, tackling a
subject that is deep but without any commercial appeal. It makes no
concessions in its attempt to peer into a world that will not be
intelligible to the audience. The flaw of the film is that it is
tedious, requiring mental endurance and toughness from the viewer.

I have good news for you.  You -- yes, you! -- could be a filmmaker and
have your name in lights.
No, you don't have to go to film school.  You don't have to think of a
story.  And you don't even have to film your movie; you already have the
ingredients on the shelves in your den -- those homemade videotapes.
No, not those sharp looking new ones made with your fancy new camcorder.
Those old, grainy, shaky ones, in which your subjects ramble
quasi-unintelligibly.  Take those, purposely assemble the clips in
random order, and, voilŕ, you are a filmmaker.  Your masterpiece can
even win the "Dogme 95" seal of approval, which says that your film was
made without use of artificial lights, sounds, props, etc.
Lest you think the chance of your rise to fame is a pipe dream, consider
JULIEN DONKEY-BOY by writer and director Harmony Korine (KIDS and
GUMMO).  There is probably a story buried there somewhere, but it takes
the press notes to decipher it, not that you'd care.  The film is the
first American movie made according to the Dogme 95 precepts.
Sandwiched between long cinematic wastelands are periodic incidents
designed to disgust us.  One has the lead character, Julien (Ewen
Bremner), take out his false teeth at dinner and dunk them several times
in his red soda.  (The colors in the film are so far off that one can
never be sure what the actual color was.)  Another has Julien leaning
over the camera as spit comes out from his mouth and snot drops from his
nose.  In the story's pičce de résistance, a performer comes to
entertain some kids.  His trick is that he stuffs more and more lit
cigarettes into his mouth, pretending to swallow them.  Eventually he
crams in an entire dozen and then spits them all back out, still
smoking.  Impressed, huh?
In another episode, an armless card player jokes about not having a card
up his sleeve.  And then there's the incident in which Julien's father
(Werner Herzog) wants Julien to put on the dress of his dead mother so
the father can dance with him.
"Shut up, shut up," the father says after hearing Julien recite a poem
made up almost entirely of the word "chaos."  "I don't really like it.
It's too artsy-fartsy."  The father then goes on to describe part of a
"real movie" -- a Dirty Harry movie.  The father's mere description of a
scene from that movie was better than the entire JULIEN DONKEY-BOY, a
movie so edgy that you'd like to push it off the edge of a cliff.
JULIEN DONKEY-BOY runs a tediously long 1:36.  It is rated R for
language, some sexuality and disturbing images.  It would be acceptable
for teenagers, who would likely be just as bored as the adults.

Julien (Ewen Bremner, The Acid House) isn't the most normal kid you will
find in cinema today.  His overbearing, wrestling-obsessed German father
(Werner Herzog) consumes entire bottles of cough syrup before prancing
around the house wearing a gas mask and offering his sons $10 to wear
Mother's wedding dress.  His pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny, The
Last Days of Disco) also dances  ballet  and calls Julien on the phone
pretending to be their dead mother. Brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
wrestles trashcans.
The trashcan wrestling, for those of you that weren't lucky enough to
see Gummo, is somewhat of an homage to the chair wrestling in
writer/director Harmony Korine's debut film.  Gummo, a critically
maligned freak-fest, was a distinctive masterpiece about two kids that
hunted and killed neighborhood cats and sold them to the local grocery
store, which turned them into fresh ground chuck.  Sure, it sounds like
something to avoid, but the movie was visually stunning, using different
film stock together with still photographs to create a shocking rural
nightmare.  It even made my Top Ten List in 1997.
Korine's new film, however, is a totally different nightmare
altogether.  Officially the first American film (and sixth overall) to
meet the strict rules of the Danish `Dogme' group (no flashbacks, no
artificial light/sound, etc.), julien donkey-boy is a mess.  The story
is virtually non-existent and, because of the Dogme restraints, the film
is much darker and considerably more grainy than Gummo.  Which leaves
only the cavalcade of freaks, including an old man who eats lit
cigarettes, a guy with no arms that plays the drums and does card
tricks, and a black albino that fancies himself a rapper, repeating `I'm
the black albino down from Alabama.'  And don't get me started on the
retard bowling.
I wasn't sure if Julien was supposed to be retarded or not.  He would
certainly seem to be if surrounded by a few normal characters.  Bremner
is also a dead ringer for Rochester Raging Rhinos midfielder Mauro
Biello.  His performance is gutsy and somewhat effective, as I actually
wondered if he may actually have a neurological disorder.  After all, he
did play similar roles in Trainspotting and The Acid House.
Korine explained, after the screening I attended, that he was approached
to join the Dogme group after Gummo and that the filming of julien
donkey-boy was closely monitored by several Danish supervisors.  The
movie was mostly improvised (save the phone call between Julien and his
dead mom) and Korine used about thirty digital cameras during filming.
Korine preferred the initial cut of the film, which ran at an ungodly
six-and-a-half hours, and, when asked if the picture was real in any
way, stated that the picture was based on `a true inspiration.'

  A high-profile critic who saw a movie I loved, "In the
Company of Men," told me that never before was he so
tempted to throw something at the screen.  When I found out
his motive was a hatred of the heartless men who are
characterized by filmmaker Neil LaBute, I congratulated him
for having emotions.  Movies should indeed make us feel:
whether good, sad, depressed, thrilled, and yes, even
absolutely enraged at evil.  The worst kind of movie is the
bland equivalent of elevator music: it's just there.
   Now, Harmony Korine's "Julien Donkey-Boy" surely does
not merit the pejorative of cinematic elevator music.  It made
me want to throw something at the screen--a shoe, a
backpack, anything available--but though the audience might
cheer such an action, my throwing arm is not as good as
Kevin Costner's and I'd only lose half a pair of Pro-Walkers. 
The problem is that my motive in wanting to heave an object
is in no way the same as my colleague's.  Nobody in Korine's
movie is villainous. There's nobody to attack.  But the picture
is so personal to the filmmaker, so lacking universality and
general interest to a diverse audience, that it might as well be
a home movie shown to bored uncles and aunts.  This time,
though, we're not even family, so multiply the exasperation
exponentially.  
   Harmony Korine, who is now 25 and turned out his first
directorial effort with the plotless, repulsive "Gummo" 
(featuring an Ohio lad who kills cats and sells the bodies to a
supermarket), is by his own statement not out to shock
people with "Julien," and he probably won't.  But he will
encourage a good deal of his audience--those who are not so
determined to demonstrate that they can perceive "art" when
most others cannot--to think, "Who cares?"  Watching some
of these characters on the screen is about as entertaining as
giving an ear to that drug-stupored denizen of the New York
subways, sprawled across four seats and mumbling
inconsequential nothings to no-one in particular.  
   The title character, a man-child played by Ewen Bremner,
is a 21-year-old schizophrenic who hears voices.  Korine
does not share those voices with his audience, but he lets us
in on quite a few babblings from Julien.  The wild-haired,
gold-toothed young man plays with a turtle (I think he
squashes it allowing its guts to spill over his face, but I
couldn't be sure).  His demented father (Werner Herzog)
plays a man who is likely a cause of the lad's emotional
problems.  Dad hoses down Julien's brother Chris (Evan
Neumann), and commands the boy not to shiver. "Be a man!" 
He offers Julien $10 to try on a dress that the boy's mother
wore to her wedding--"That's a month's pay for someone in
Bangladesh."  When Julien's pregnant sister Pearl (Chloe
Sevigny) has a miscarriage after falling on the ice rink, Julien
takes the baby's corpse, steals it away from the hospital, and
rides it home on the train, hugging it to his person while
crawling under his bed.  Poignant this is not.
   When Korine thinks we've had enough of this Julien, he
takes us to other Fellini-esque characters, including an
armless man who plays cards and drums with his feet, an
black man who sings a rap song over and over about how
he's an Albino from Alabama; and a saleswoman in a baby
clothing department who tells Pearl that when the first-born is
a boy, the womb is blessed.
   Korine's picture is photographed with 30 cameras, using
the Dogma 95 technique glorified by the Danish filmmaker
Lars von Triers.  Dogma 95, which could be subtitled
Chastity, us a kind of Brechtian notion that illusion should be
stripped away, avoiding special effects or anything else that
would get in the way of a documentary-style of capturing
images.  Clearly Korine's goal in using video, blowing it up for
the big screen, is to capture a greater intimacy than can be
snared by directors with opulent illusionary means at their
disposal.  With characters like the wearisome group
promenading across this plotless, clueless film, intimacy is
the last thing we may want.

_julien_donkey-boy_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
In February, I said that no film this year could possibly be worse than
the thoroughly unwatchable _Six_Ways_to_Sunday_.  Well, I take that back.
 The sophomore directorial effort of Harmony Korine (whose 1997 debut,
_Gummo_, is the epitome of love-hate films) is one steaming, smelly pile
of cinematic excrement.  Much has been made that this "film" (using that
term very loosely) is the first American production to be made under
Dogme 95--the commandments of cinematic "purity" created by Danish
filmmakers Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, among others-- but
slapping on such a label doesn't excuse Korine's sloppy, downright
incoherent filmmaking.  You know you're in trouble when the synopsis
provided in the film's press notes in no way resembles what you see on
screen.  Purportedly, the film is about the "internal struggle" of
schizophrenic julien (Ewen Bremner), which "increases in intensity until
the film's shocking and bizarrely transcendent conclusion."
Now, this is what I saw for 94 long, seemingly endless minutes: scenes
of Bremner jumping up and down and speaking incoherently; scenes of
julien's pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny) dancing ballet and playing
the harp; wordless scenes of a young blind figure skater (Chrissy
Kobylak) doing a routine; and, most memorably, julien's father (Werner
Herzog) hosing down and belittling julien's brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
into becoming "a champion"--that is, whenever not chugging cough syrup
and listening to records while wearing a gas mask.  To say that none of
it adds up would be to imply a natural connection between scenes that
isn't there.  The herky-jerky Dogme camera movements and grainy film
stock just makes the film look more like--and thereby confirm--what it
is: pure garbage.
