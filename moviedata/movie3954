Susan Granger's review of "RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE: (Paramount Pictures)
   In this animated sequel to the highly successful "Rugrats
Movie" which sprang from the Nickelodeon TV series, the focus is on
Chuckie (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), rather than baby Tommy
(voiced by E.G. Daily). It seems Chuckie's mommy has gone to heaven
and he really, really, really wants a new mommy, which puts pressure
on his dad Chas (voiced by Michael Bell). The theme of wanting to have
a complete family is particularly resonant today - what with death,
divorce and remarriage so prevalent. Somehow, a trip to Paris is tied
into opening your heart and moving on. But it's not the touristy Paris
of the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower or the Seine. Most of the action takes
place in an amusement park, EuroReptarland, which is an obvious poke
at EuroDisneyland. The main Reptar attraction has broken and only Stu
Pickles (voiced by Jack Riley) can repair it - hence, the family trip
which includes Chas and Chuckie. Sparks fly from the nasty, Cruella
DeVil-like park manager, Coco La Bouche (voiced by Susan Sarandon),
who realizes that she must marry in order to get a promotion. Spurred
on by meddling matchmaker Angelica (voiced by Cheryl Chase), with the
aid of her pretentious assistant, Jean-Claude (voiced by John
Lithgow), Coco plots to wed Chas, even though she loathes
children. There's potty humor and a kid-pleasing climactic chase
involving the Rugrats on the repaired dinosaur and Jean-Claude in his
huge, mechanical Escargot, plus cameos from Debbie Reynolds, Tim Curry
and Casey Kasem. Musically, there's Sinead O'Connor's rendition of
"When You Love" and the BahaMen's catchy "Who Let the Dogs Out." On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Rugrats in Paris" is a
fast-paced, amusing 6 for tiny tykes - and it's quite tolerable for
adults.

Well, the Rugrats are back, and, as usual, they're way too sophisticated
for their audience.  The Simpsons of the Nickelodeon Network has
meandered its way back onto the big screen, and this time they are
hitting the streets of Paris with more Freudian slips than a
sexually-charged first date.
To start with, Grandpa Lou has gotten remarried (leading into, by the
way, an excellent parody of The Godfather in the first scene) and all
Chuckie wants is a mommy.  Meanwhile, Stu Pickles gets a call from Paris
demanding that he come to fix a giant mechanical Reptar (a wonderful
running Godzilla/Pokemon spoof gag from the series) which he designed.
After discovering the mommy button on an airplane (the flight attendant
button), Chuckie decides that Paris is the perfect place to find a new
mommy.  The group proceeds to EuroReptarLand, where we discover that one
Coco LaBouche (Susan Sarandon) needs to become a mother so she can move
ahead in the Japanese conglomerate for which she works (oh, all the
feminist implications one can see in this).  Manipulative as Coco is,
she decides to romance Chuckie's dad via her secretary Kira's knowledge
of childrearing.
>From here on in the plot flows predictably, and the movie inserts its
share of both lowbrow puns and intelligent humor throughout the entire
film, making for a satisfactory viewing experience... a kid's movie the
rest of us can stand (or even enjoy).
Of course Rugrats in Paris is hardly exemplary.  It lacks the witty
parodies of the first Rugrats film, and goes for too many
fart-and-diaper jokes that are strictly kids-only.  The show would
better serve itself to go completely the route of The Simpsons and
dropping all pretense of being kiddie fare, instead using its writers'
satiric wit for all it's worth.  But, as the Rugrats franchise will be
raking in quite a few pretty pennies, don't expect anything like that to
happen anytime soon.  Instead, expect that these movies will gradually
get less and less intelligent, until one day Rugrats is nothing more
than just another one of those dumb kid's movies you can't stand.

Some people complained about German-born Roland Emmerich being chosen to
direct The Patriot  the country's premiere film about our fight for
independence.  Spike Lee recently shot his big mouth off when he found
out an upcoming biopic about Muhammad Ali was going to be helmed by a
white guy instead of a black director.
A wise woman once asked `But what about the children?' (okay, it was
Reverend Lovejoy's wife on The Simpsons).  The U.S.'s latest kiddie
flick to hit theatres is set in Paris and directed by  a Belgian
(Paul Demeyer) and a Swede (Stig Bergqvist).  Terrific  we can't even
decide who our next leader is going to be, and in the meantime, our
children are being brainwashed with anti-American propaganda from two
European countries that have always seemed a little too peaceful, if you
know what I mean.
Luckily, Rugrats in Paris is a pretty decent film.  As an adult, I
enjoyed this sequel a lot more than the first Rugrats picture,
especially the hilarious send-up of The Godfather's opening scene.
Instead of Connie Corleone's pending nuptials, this film begins with a
wedding between Grandpa Lou and his new bride Lulu (voiced by Debbie
Reynolds, although Talia Shire would have been a perfect fit).  The
festivities are highlighted by a mother-son dance, in which the
perpetually scared, two-toothed redhead named Chuckie wishes aloud that
his mother was still around to dance with him (apparently, she's been
dead for some time).
In the meantime, Tommy's father Stu is called to France, where his giant
mechanical Reptar has malfunctioned, potentially delaying the opening of
a stage performance (a la `Miss Saigon') in Euro-Reptar Land, a Japanese
theme park in Paris.  For some reason, Stu decides to bring not only his
whole family, but all of his friends and their families, too.  A mildly
amusing montage of the packing, passport application process and air
flight ensues.
When the gang hits Paris (where wee-wee becomes oui-oui), we're
introduced to Coco (Susan Sarandon), the director of the Reptar stage
extravaganza who is under the impression that she needs to find a family
in order to receive a promotion within the Japanese conglomerate that
owns the theme park.  Coco latches onto Chuckie's father, Chas, who
seems like a better match for Coco's pretty Japanese assistant, Kira
(Melanie Griffith).
If this jumble of characters seemed confusing to you, you've probably
never seen the show.  While Paris may still be enjoyable if you haven't,
it probably helps if you've taken in at least a few episodes.  The kids
spurt out funny malapropisms, like `over my dad's potty,' instead of
`over my dead body,' just like the television series.  Paris also
includes some really slick animation, save the crudely drawn characters,
especially with shadows and reflections.
I was really enjoying the film until they started in with the `Who Let
the Dogs Out' song (not a great way to teach little kids to keep their
traps shut while they're in a movie theatre).  Also glaringly evident
was the fact that Paris had more fart/shit/piss gags than Adam Sandler's
new film (which was rated PG-13 to Paris' G).  While the film's story
would probably have been better suited for an hour-long television
special (with commercials) than an 80-minute film, Paris is still heads
and shoulders above most recent children's films.

The Rugrats are back in a movie, RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, that is 
sweeter and funnier than their first.  Offering as much for the adults 
as the kids, the film opens with the classic wedding scene from the 
Godfather, complete with Nino Rota's music.  In a darkened room, one of 
the Rugrats, asking a favor of the "Bobfather," starts off with "I 
believe in the playground ..."  The surprise is that this scene plays as 
smartly funny for the kids in the audience as the adults.  My son 
mentioned it as one of his favorite parts.  
One of the girls even wakes up with a dead horse's head in her bed.  
Don't worry, the movie is correctly rated G.  The head came off of a 
rocking horse.  This scene, however, is one that undoubtedly will appeal 
mainly to the adults.
The Rugrats, as always, get much of their humor from their rampant 
malapropisms.  "Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bread," one of 
them remarks about a crabby stewardess.  The story has Chuckie's dad 
trying to find a wife.  When the kids hear about him looking for a 
"date," they decide that a date is a "raisin that makes you poop."
Mr. Pickles and the rest of the crew head for Paris where he is called 
to repair a large mechanical dinosaur called Reptar that is being used 
in something approximating a Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  The Paris 
setting gives the animators a chance to show off their colorful talents 
to maximum effect.  The result is a bright and cheerful movie that is a 
delight to watch.
The foreign locale also provides many opportunities for humor.  As the 
kids play with the first bidet that they have ever seen, one 
ecstatically proclaims, "Wow, a potty that squirts you back!"
My favorite line comes when the adults are in church.  As they sit in 
their pews at the famous Notre Dame cathedral, one of them starts to nod 
off to sleep.  "If you've seen one church, you've seen them all," she 
says sarcastically.  "Wake me if you see a hunchback."
So what monster will the French use in the big battle against Reptar?  
Why a gigantic, bright blue snail, of course.  The really gutsy move is 
that by Nickelodeon.  They scheduled it to open opposite THE GRINCH 
juggernaut.  They'll need help from all of the snails that they can get 
to knock out that blockbuster.  And they'll need lots of garlic.
RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE runs a fast 1:18.  It is rated G and would 
be fine for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, loves Rugrats and their latest movie, giving it 
****.  His favorite scene was Reptar's showdown with the big snail.  He 
also mentioned the music among several other parts that he really liked.  
His friend Maxim, age 12, gave it ***, saying it was a good movie but 
had only an okay plot.  His favorite parts were those with Reptar in 
them.

I enjoyed this film so much, I wondered if it overshot the intended
audience. So I asked a few little tikes after the film. Two were too shy,
but their mom said they loved it. And the other one, he left the theater
singing, "Who let the dogs out!" the Baha Men's catchy chorus off the film's
soundtrack. That should clinch it then, a strong follow-up to the first
"Rugrats - The Movie."
The opening logo comes together in brilliant computer-animated ease forming
the familiar fun Nickelodeon-styled "Rugrats," then the lights dim as the
text changes to "The Godfather" font. You can expect this parody to pepper
spice the rest of this kids' flick. But there are plenty of other adult
ingredients, and two diapers full of pottie humor to go around for everyone.
After taking the consequence, Tommy is scorned by Angelica, "That's what you
get for winging your buggers on Susie." Undaunted Tommy smiles, "So that's
where I left 'em!"
Mr. Pickles gets a call from France summoning him to fix the huge
Godzilla-spoof robot he engineered for the Disneyland-spoof EuroReptarland.
Of course he takes the whole family. But this movie's star is really
Chuckie. Chuckie's need for a new mom compels him to search deep down and
find the courage to approach a beautiful princess. But he isn't the only one
scheming prospective partners for his single dad.
Though most of the animation is painted in the old fashion 2-D style; the
colors are Starburst juicy, and the action paced for those with little tiny
attention spans - so don't expect to be bored. These little munchkins get
into everything! And of course, songs tie it all together. You'll no doubt
be singing "Who let the dogs out" during your walk to the parking lot. But
there are a few other notes of note as well: "Chuckie Chan," the dream
sequence ("He'll break up the party if he's not on the pottie"), and "Reptar
I love you" (a refreshing poke-funnery of those Disney classic odes).
Chuckie-full of juicy one liners, you'll have to keep your ears open:
"I love their fries and all ... but."
"See how nice his head stays on."
"It's a nerd, it's a pain, it's Angelica!"
