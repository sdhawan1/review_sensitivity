"You've Got Mail," the third showcase that has brought together the 
winning team of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (after 1990's odd-ball "Joe Vs. 
the Volcano" and 1993's charming "Sleepless in Seattle"), obviously 
seemed like a no-brainer for director Nora Ephron and co-writer Delia 
Ephron since what they have basically made this time around is a ho-hum, 
mostly sloppy retread of many far more intelligent and witty romantic 
comedies.
Set in New York City, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), for many years, has run 
her late mother's quaint children's bookstore called "The Shop Around 
the Corner" (which was the title of the original James Stewart picture, 
for which this film is based on). She has a writer boyfriend (Greg 
Kinnear), but has been recently sending honest and intimate e-mails over 
AOL to a man that she first met in an Over 30 chatroom, but they have 
decided to keep their identities anonymous. What Kathleen doesn't know 
is that her secret e-mail buddy is actually Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), who has 
his own hyper and giddy girlfriend (Parker Posey), and is about to open 
a more high-profile book store on the same street, threatening 
Kathleen's business. The gimmick for the film is that these two people 
have grown to love each other over the internet, even though they are 
feuding in real life.
"You've Got Mail," is a sleek, well-photographed romantic comedy that 
actually compliments the beauty of NYC more than the actual stars of the 
film, since this story has been done far too many times before, and much 
better, at that. One of the biggest problems with the film is that there 
didn't appear to be any attempt to make an original film. No doubt, 
Ephron assumed that she had it made once she cast Hanks and Ryan, and so 
she forgot to add a quality screenplay. Watching the film, I didn't get 
any sense of excitement, urgency, or suspense involving the question of 
if Hanks and Ryan would get together at the end, since I knew for a fact 
that they would. Far too many times, I predicted dialogue and even what 
would occur in the next scene, and most of the time I was right on the 
mark. If an audience member can predict what the characters are going to 
say before they actually say it, then you know you're in trouble.
I will not criticize Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, since both of them have 
proved to be talented actors, and Ryan is simply too cute for words, but 
that is the exact problem. They are too good to be wasting their time in 
such a tried-and-true Hollywood formula. "Sleepless in Seattle" was also 
predictable, but that film was more sound and sharp in its writing and I 
cared about the characters more. Why not shake things up a bit and add a 
little creativity to the mix, instead of making what is basically an 
inferior remake to "...Seattle?"
Rarely have I seen so many charasmatic supporting characters wasted so 
blatantly as they are in this movie. Greg Kinnear has the most chance of 
a developed character, but he disappears towards the middle and there is 
no mention of him again. Parker Posey, in her first notable role in a 
big-budget film, is punished with the emotionless "bitch" role, and is 
not even given one scene where she and Hanks simply talk. It's a shame 
Ephron decided to cast such a wonderful, fresh actress, only to throw 
her to the curb. Meanwhile, Dave Chappelle and Steve Zahn make no 
impression whatsoever with roles that might as well have been classified 
as extras.
Maybe I am making it sound like I hated "You've Got Mail," which isn't 
the case. The film was never boring, but also never what I would 
consider entertaining. Basically, it just seemed to sit there, and it 
amazed me how little could be accomplished, even though the running time 
is overstretched to two hours. Hanks and Ryan, like always, have a great 
deal of chemistry together, and I liked their characters. I liked a few 
of the lines of dialogue (when Hanks enters a store, he introduces the 
two children he is with as his aunt and brother). The soundtrack of 
popular pop songs from the 70's, 80's, and 90's were fun to listen to. 
Everything seemed in place for a charming, and I was hoping, 
imaginative, romantic comedy, but to no avail. Nora Ephron may have hit 
the jackpot with "Sleepless in Seattle," and I am also an admirer of her 
underrated 1994 comedy, "Mixed Nuts," but "You've Got Mail," ultimately, 
fails to add anything new or worthwhile into the now worn-out romantic 
comedy genre.

Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Dave
Chappelle, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, Dabney Coleman.
Screenplay: Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron.
Producers: Lauren Shuler Donner and Nora Ephron.
Director: Nora Ephron.
    In the romantic, feel-good comedy of the year we once again have the
successful pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. This movie belongs to
Ryan, who is at her best - you won't see her smile or gesture more,
carrying with her an innate radiance that simply lights up the screen.
She has truly reached her prime, a remarkable, natural comedienne of our
time, who carries a unique, magical quality that will be remembered many
years from now. With Nora and Delia Ephron combining to write a
post-modern, romantic comedy that is well written, humorous and above
all intelligent, this story will bring cheer to everyone during the
holiday season.
     The story is about love on the Internet and love in real life. Ryan
and Hank's characters are soul mates by Net (known only to each other by
the pseudonyms Shopgirl' and NY152') and fierce competitors by day.
The dilemma lies in the fact that they despise each other in real life 
Hank's owns a megasize, chain of bookstores that is killing Ryan's
self-run, children's bookstore. The question posed to the viewer is
whether you can end up loving someone that you started out hating. With
frequent references to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the answer is
yes  the prejudiced Ms Bennet, does end up falling for the proud Mr
Darcy. But the answer is not so simple in this movie  not only do we
have computers, cyber-relationships and books to complicate the matter,
it is the fine tuning of wit, humour and circumstance, intricately
crafted by two sisters, that brings this difficult situation to a
believable, well-timed, lyrical ending.

When the perception of America's downtowns became one of fear and
inconvenience, we decided that we'd rather shop in Disneyland. Thus began the
malling of the nation. Although it never happened, the original concept of
shopping malls was that they would become miniature towns.
What they've turned into are sanitized homogenous Everywheres. Walk into any
mall in any city and it doesn't matter where you are, you're in "The Mall".
You can buy the same pair of jeans from the same Gap in the same mall in
nearly every city in the country. The malls are safe and easy shopping but
they're remarkably boring.
Even worse they've resulted in the deaths of uncountable enchanting small
shops. As the managers of the mall stores are packing up the day's money and
shipping it off to the home office thousands of miles away, the owners of the
small shops are staying awake nights trying to figure out how to pay bills.
Eventually they can't.
Now that downtowns are regaining some of their appeal and becoming gentrified,
it's happening there also. Stick a Starbucks on every corner, an Old Navy and
Barnes and Noble down every block and soon we'll have one city multiplied many
times over across the continent.
Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of The Shop Around The Corner, a small
children's bookshop and she's just received terrible news. A Fox Books
Superstore is opening in her neighborhood and she knows that means the end of
the business that her mother started decades ago.
When she runs into Joe Fox (Tom Ryan), the youngest of the Fox Books
patriarchy, at a social gathering, they take an instant dislike to each other.
Joe is the ultimate businessman delighting in running competitors out of
business. ("It's not personal, it's business.")
At their homes they both wait for their lovers to leave each morning before
logging onto AOL to check emails. Booting up her Mac Powerbook  and signing in
as "Shopgirl", Kathleen has lost her cyber-heart to "NY152" whom she met in an
over-30 chatroom. They've never met and don't know each other's actual
identities, but exchange poetic messages across the ethers.
Since this is a movie, NY152 is Joe. In a real chat room Shopgirl would be a
13 year-old girl pretending to be a sex goddess and NY152 would be a German Shepherd.
A remake of the 1940's "The Shop Around The Corner", the film is a return to
light romantic comedies of bygone days. Reuniting Hanks, Ryan and director
Nora Ephron from "Sleepless In Seattle", this proves that you can use the same
actors, virtually the same plot and still produce an enjoyable film.
"Mail" has about a thousand things going for it. It's a feel-good film with
phenomenally likable actors. It's a Christmas release: just the time when
people need a break in their frantic schedule. It's about finding the true
love everyone searches for.
Tom Hanks is the all-American guy. His roles are generally those of highly
principled courageous men. He's easy to trust. He begins this film as a
hard-nosed businessman, but you just know he's going to warm up.
Meg Ryan is the closest thing to being America's sweetheart that the cynical
nineties can allow. Every single thing about her is perky and she brightens up
the screen whenever she's on. For the males in the audience she could probably
carry a film by just showing up.
These two are people that we'd like to have as friends or lovers and
desperately want to cling to the illusion (or reality) that they are the same
people offscreen as they are in the films. We want them in our lives even if
only for two hours. They are what makes the film work although their chemistry
is Love-Lite. There is a spark there, but no fire.
The supporting cast is fairly strong. Greg Kinnear is Frank, Kathleen's
Luddite boyfriend who is passionate about everything except her. Parker Posey,
the queen of independent films, plays Patricia, Joe's live-in. Patricia is a
hyper career woman who as Joe says, "makes coffee nervous." You get the
feeling that both couples lead such busy lives they haven't noticed that they
have fallen out of love. Until the chatroom.
The film is not completely wonderful. It's acceptable that everyone
anticipates the ending in advance, after all this is a romantic comedy. What's
not quite so agreeable is that everything is so damned cute.
Meg Ryan is adorable. We don't have to be reminded of that over and over.
Yeah, she looks good even in flannel PJs, but showing her prance around to a
cartoon music soundtrack is banging us over the head with the obvious. When
the two internet lovers pass on the street without realizing who each other
is, it's amusing. The second and third times add nothing.
Joe makes major changes through the film, but once he discovers who Shopgirl
is, he is still manipulative, always with the upper hand. There is a lack of
honesty in the character that is troubling.
Kathleen's struggling shopkeeper role is compromised by the fact that she has
far too many employees in a small store and towards the end seems able to live
comfortably without the shop's income. Her and Frank's breakup is the stuff of
fantasy, never to occur in the real world. But maybe it's looking too deep to
notice these things. This is a fairy tale. 
Some of the film rings true especially for those of us who check email before
that first cigarette or cup of coffee. The comment that closing the shop would
be the "brave thing to do" because it would give her the chance to imagine her
life some other way is an intriguing idea.
Although I enjoy both actors, "Sleepless In Seattle" was not my favorite film,
suffering as it did from the same terminal cuteness. This one is better but it
could have done with some judicious editing. It's not a masterpiece, but it is
nice. I can live with that.

        Another misleading theatrical trailor led me to believe that this
film would primarily be about the two main character's courtship via the
internet, with them finally meeting each other during the last five
minutes of the movie.  Meeting as in finally revealing their identities to
each other.  Tom Hanks's Joe Fox finding out that his online love is his real
life rival so early was as shocking to me as "Psycho's" Marion Crane dying
20 minutes or so into the movie.  Well, maybe I exaggerate, but to me this
is where "You've Got Mail" worked.  With clever writing, the Ephron
sisters shrewdly avoided having the movie turn into just another
"Sleepless In Seattle" clone.  This way, Joe gets a chance to find out
another side of Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan's) persona that she does not
reveal in cyberspace.  If he hadn't know the "shopgirl" side of Kathleen,
Joe would not have understood that Kathleen's biting words were just an
effort of defiance; if Joe's "NY152" alter-ego hadn't found out that
Kathleen IRL (In Real Life, in cyberspeak ) was such a charming, funny
woman, he might never have fallen in love with her completely.   Another
bonus is that we get acquainted with two sides of Joe Fox.  On one side we
get the ruthless millionaire who sees everyone and everything as
competition, who will stop at nothing to destroy his enemies; when we sit
down with Joe at the computer, we see someone trapped in a hopeless
relationship, someone who is sympathetic to the underdog.  One side he's
flippant, reckless; on the other he's honest, serious.  As much as we would
like to hate Joe Fox for his lack of mercy, as hard as it may be to
reconcile his two personalities, we have to: I do, since I too have a side of
myself that I despise.  This movie demonstrates the best possible outcome
of an internet romance -- when you know someone inside        *and* out.
        "You've Got Mail" is merry, seasonal, spiced up with a jazzy
soundtrack that puts you at once in a romantic mood.  Albeit slow at times
and filled with sidetrackers (for example, I had not expected them to
delve so much into Kathleen's faltering business; I have no complaints,
though, since one of my favorite scenes from the movie stems from this
storyline - the memory sequence of Kathleen dancing with her mother in
the store.  Amazing score here), the film is satisfying.  Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan get my vote as the cutest couple of the year, and though both are
wonderful in their roles, I'd have to say Tom wins my heart with his funny
mannerisms and expressions.  This guy *does* deserve two academy
awards (and another one coming next year?).  I also enjoyed Parker Posey
and Greg Kinnear's wickedly annoying performances as the ex-boyfriend
and ex-girlfriend.  With a whimsical script and a playful score, "You've
Got Mail" is the Very Hollywood feel-good answer to all the cynicism we
see in our country right now.  
* Kudos for the lovely opening sequence.  The dark colors created a lonely,
impersonal atmosphere; yet cyberspace never looked so amiable.

Directed by Nora Ephron (Sleepless in Seattle)
Written by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron (Mixed Nuts)
Starring Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan), Meg Ryan (When Harry Met Sally),
Parker Posey (Coneheads), Greg Kinnear (As Good as it Gets)
Some people feel the need to do something more than once (i.e. Gus Van Sant
with Psycho).  Some people feel the need to re-unite actors (i.e. Edward
Burns). Some people feel the need to re-hash a plot (take your pick of any
number of movies).  But only a select few can pull it off.
Nora Ephron, Tom Hanks, and Meg Ryan have graduated into that select cadre
with You've Got Mail.
The plot is a carbon-copy of Sleepless in Seattle, their earlier
collaboration: a man and a woman are completely in love with one another
without ever having direct contact in a romantic sense.  In Sleepless in
Seattle, it was a radio broadcast late at night that turned Meg Ryan on to
Tom Hanks.  In You've Got Mail, we have fully entered the electronic world
and this time the two meet in an AOL over 30 chatroom.  The two of them
begin corresponding via the electronic medium while hashing it out in real
life.  Tom Hanks is Joe Fox, book mogul and owner of the new Fox Books
superstore in the Upper West Side.  Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, your average
Upper West Side indepdent bookstore owner challenging the conglomerates
springing up around her.
If you've seen Sleepless in Seattle, you already know where this will end
up.  In fact, it ends up just about where every other one of these romantic
comedies ends up: the boy gets the girl.  Along the way there's the radical
difference (and the differences, I remind you, are all that matter
nowadays), that the two people in love are fully using the electronic
medium: not to mention committing Internet infidelity at the same time (Tom
Hanks cheating on Parker Posey, Meg Ryan cheating on Greg Kinnear).  If that
wasn't enough to make it different, this one adds in the nice aspect of
character development.
All of us who care -- smart people, movie critics, patrons of romances
rather than action films -- will be much more pleased that we finally see a
movie where the characters are cared about and not you equation romances.
We can actually fall in love along with them.  In this aspect, because of
the fact that the two main characters are seen both inside and outside of
the context of their romance, it actually far surpasses Sleepless in
Seattle, which, to be honest, was somewhat lacking.
So, all you romantic comedy fans, go ahead and stop by the local multiplex
and get your mail.  You may just be surprised what it says.

Since finding love on the Internet is a big 90s fad, it didn't surprise
me at all when I heard Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were starring in a remake of the
1940 film, `A Shop Around The Corner.' Also rejoining Hanks & Ryan, from
`Sleepless in Seattle,' is director Nora Ephron.
The plot is interesting, fairly original, and everything fits together
so well, it's almost like a fable. Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) owns a small
children's bookstore in New York City, aptly called, Shop Around the Corner.
Her mother started the business, and the store and its employees are her life.
Everything is going great, until a giant discount bookstore opens up close to
her shop. The store is part of a large company, named Fox Books. Joe Fox (Tom
Hanks) is one of the executives in Fox Books and Kathleen and he become fierce
business rivals.
Little do the both know that they have been communicating with each
other, under nicknames, on the Internet. After exchanging e-mails and chatting
for awhile, Joe asks to meet with her. But when he arrives at the meeting
place, he recognizes Kathleen and pretends he just happened to bump into her.
Joe's life gets complicated when Kathleen's shop starts to fail and he begins
to fall in love with her. Now he has to get her to forgive him for ruining her
business and figure out a way to tell her he was the guy on the net, all this
time.
It's a cute premise that plays out quite well. This is, in thanks,
mostly to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's great chemistry.  Whenever they are on the
screen together, sparks fly. Greg Kinnear turns in a good performance as
Kathleen's journalist boyfriend. The main drawback was its length, it runs
over two hours. Other than that, this is a great date movie; it's
entertaining, romantic, and downright likeable.

As soon as their respective live-in lovers have left their apartments,
Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly, with devious smiles, sneak off to their
addictions.  They're having an affair with each other over the Internet.
Well, more precisely, they have established intimate relations with each
other electronically, while never disclosing any personal information
like what they do for a living.  They don't ever know each other's real
names.  Joe's handle is a cryptic "NY152," and Kathleen has a slightly
more revealing one of "shopgirl."
"Don't you love New York in the fall?" Joe begins one of his typical
missives.  "It makes me want to buy school supplies.  I would send you a
bouquet of newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address.  On
the other hand, this not knowing has its charms."
A movie that tries hard to charm your socks off, YOU'VE GOT MAIL
succeeds most of the time.  The SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE team of writer and
director Nora Ephron and acting duo Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan again manage
the seemingly undoable.  They create a PG-rated romantic comedy for
adults with an intelligent and hilarious script and with charismatic
acting.  Without feeling the need to disrobe or toss around obscenities,
the adorable picture makes its points.
Based on the 1940 classic film, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, the
deliciously intricate story has Joe (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen (Meg Ryan)
find out about each other in layers.  At various times in the story,
they are E-mail buddies, strangers, casual acquaintances, warring
business owners and lovers.  Joe manages to discover things ahead of
Kathleen, which adds another level of complexity since he keeps his
knowledge a secret.
Joe and his relatives own "Fox Books," a large chain that specializes
in, as Joe puts it, "cheap books and legally addictive stimulants,"
i.e., discount books and various designer coffees.  In business he is
ruthless, willing to "go to the mattresses" whenever necessary to crush
a competitor.  If you don't understand that quote, don't be surprised.
Joe has to explain it to Kathleen as well.  All of Joe's business
strategy comes from his memorization of lines from THE GODFATHER of
which this quote is one.
Joe lives with a hyperactive publisher named Patricia Eden, played
perfectly by indie queen Parker Posey.  As Joe so aptly puts it,
"Patricia makes coffee nervous."
As the nerdy columnist Frank Navasky, Greg Kinnear is as cute a bug.
Frank worships typewriters and keeps two handy at all times to compose
his erudite musings.  In one of his best scenes, he is turned to mush on
television by a doting talk show host, played by Jane Adams from
HAPPINESS.  Except for Joe's uninteresting and bizarre relatives, the
movie has a strong cast that is given their fair share of juicy lines.
Kathleen runs a bookstore known quaintly as "The Shop around the
Corner."  It is a family business and the shop's oldest employee, Birdie
(Jean Stapleton), acts as a surrogate mother to Kathleen.  One day, when
everyone is busy warning Kathleen about the dangers of her online
relationship with a stranger, Birdie tells them about her experience.
"I tried to have cybersex once," Birdie confesses.  "But I kept on
getting a busy signal."
A background star of the show is New York City itself.  The movie
captures its romantic rhythms and sights in such a subtle way that you
slowly fall in love with the city without even realizing it's flirting
with you.
The light and breezy movie goes down as easy as one of those large,
fancy coffee drinks featured prominently in the story.  The movie,
however, is a little too large.  Skimming off a little of the froth,
like Joe's relatives, would improve the brew.
Even if the mixture is not absolutely perfect, it is consistently
charming and delightful.  With two attractive and lovable stars and with
a script that will have you in stitches, the film is a welcome Christmas
present for the romantically inclined.  To be fair, the bah humbug crowd
and those with a low sugar tolerance may find the movie more than they
can stomach.  Others may be so enchanted that they feel like they can
float out of the theater at the end.
YOU'VE GOT MAIL runs about 2:00.  It is rated PG for mature themes.  The
picture could be enjoyed by anyone over 10, and, although there's
nothing to offend younger ones, they may well be bored.

The first big disappointment of the holiday season is You've Got Mail (*
˝), Nora Ephron's uneven re-pairing of Sleepless in Seattle lovebirds
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Surprisingly empty and enormously light, Mail is
anchored only by the presence of its two huge stars.
Once past the nifty computer-generated opening of a virtual New York
City, viewers will be introduced to the two main characters.  Ryan is
Kathleen Kelly, an endlessly perky and chipper owner of a small
children's book store.  Hanks plays Joe Fox, the puffy-faced owner of a
huge chain of successful bookstores (a la Barnes and Noble) that is
opening its new outlet around the corner and intends to run Kelly's shop
out of business.  They unknowingly met in a chat room (before the film
starts) and have been communicating via e-mail for monthsbut neither
knows who their pen-pal really is.
The rest of the story unfolds so predictably unimaginative that it
actually rivals Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit in terms of a sheer lack
of originality.  Essentially a remake of The Shop Around the Corner, the
1946 Jimmy Stewart/Margaret Sullavan classic, Mail plods along at
powerfully sluggish two-hour pace that is about 30 minutes too long for
fare this shallow and slight.  Nobody that has been to the movies in the
past forty years should be entertained by this film or surprised by its
outcome.
Hanks' phoned-in performance is particularly vacant and reminiscent of
Harrison Ford's wooden turn in Sabrina, while Ryan is, as always, a
pleasure to watch.  His charm is turned down to around `3' and hers is
cranked up to about `12'.  Mail will likely draw many comparisons to
Seattle  a film about two love-hungry adults that fall for each other
site unseen.
Why did the studio honchos think that the average American needed to see
a flick so similar that they actually enlisted the same stars?  The
answer is simple  money.  Hanks and Ryan are huge box office draws.
Why?  Because he's the type of guy that men want to be, and she is the
girl that most women secretly wish they were (but will never ever
admitever).
Mail also boasts an amazing cast of co-stars  Greg Kinnear, Jean
Stapleton, Dave Chappelle and Dabney Coleman capably handle their roles,
but Steve Zahn and indie-goddess Parker Posey stand out in their smaller
parts.  How does a film pay for this many stars of this magnitude?  The
answer is simple  product placement.  Prepare to have America Online,
Starbucks, Apple and Microsoft products shoved in your face for a full
two hours.
I have a few suggestions for better plots; the most obvious being a more
realistic story of two people who meet on the Internet.  He would be a
400-pound unemployed Star Trek fan pretending to be a successful
businessman, while she would say that she resembles Cindy Crawford but
would actually turn out to be a man.  Oh, yeah, and he would be a serial
killer, too.  The tagline would be `Life Is Like A Box Of Chocolates.'
Other suggestions include You've Got Herpes  a madcap comedy
(presumably starring either Pauly Shore or Charlie Sheen) about a guy
who has a drunken one-time sexual encounter with a girl he meets on the
Internet and wakes up with genital warts and a white, clumpy discharge.
The rest of the film would be a hilarious romp as the Shore/Sheen
character tried to track down the one-night stand, who would also turn
out to be a serial killer.  Tagline  `This Christmas, Pornography Isn't
The Only Thing Brad Flaherty Downloads.'
Or You've Got Cancer  a bittersweet drama, directed by David Lynch,
about a Willy Loman-type travelling salesman who neglects his family and
dies of prostate cancer.  Things take a surreal turn when, one year
after his death, the soul of the salesman is transferred to the toilet
brush in his family's downstairs bathroom.  The brush tries to be a
better father to his two small children, but fails miserably as the
children grow so frightened of him that they develop a psychological
fear of the bathroom and must be hospitalized for severe constipation.
Tragically, when the family returns home from the hospital, they find
the brush hanging from a pipe on the bathroom ceiling.  Then the two
kids would grow up to be serial killers.  Tagline  `Frank Schwartz
Thought His Life Was BadUntil He Died.'
How about You've Got Conjoined Twin Myslexia  the big-screen debut of
television's South Park centers around the origins of the two-faced
school nurse.  The kids would get to use dirtier words, Cartman's
manhood would be revealed, Stan would be a serial killer and Kenny would
die in every reel.  Tagline  `Give Us Your Money; It's South Park!'
Actually, You've Got anything (except Mail) would have been an
improvement.
You've Got Mail (1:59) is rated PG for some very mild language and some
adult situations.

_You've_Got_Mail_ (PG) **** (out of ****)
Of all the delights to be had while watching the enchanting romantic
comedy _You've_Got_Mail_, none gave me more joy than the performance of
co-lead Meg Ryan.  The reigning queen of romantic comedy, Ryan, not so
surprisingly, delivers another turn of irresistible charm as bookstore
owner Kathleen Kelly.  But what I paid conscious attention to this time
around was the ease with which she tackles the deceptively simple-looking
job of romantic comedienne.  It's no easy task to project a natural blend
of sweetness, strength, wit, and genuine, hard-earned heart, yet Ryan has
effortlessly pulled it off year after year, in movie after movie--without
ever receiving her rightful recognition from the critics.
Sadly, _You've_Got_Mail_ will likely not change that, but that's mostly
because so much of the film is so good.  The film reunites Ryan with her
_Sleepless_in_Seattle_ partners Tom Hanks and director/co-writer (with
sister Delia) Nora Ephron in a plot that, not so coincidentally, appears to
be a variation of that 1993 blockbuster.  Ryan's Kathleen owns the small
children's bookstore The Shop Around the Corner, whose long life as a
Manhattan neighborhood staple is threatened by the nearby opening of a
Barnes and Noble-like superstore called Fox Books, owned by wealthy Joe Fox
(Hanks).  Naturally, it's hate at first sight for Joe and Kathleen, but
little do they know that appears to be their first meeting really
isn't--they have anonymously been conducting a romance over the Internet as
"NY152" (Joe) and "Shopgirl" (Kathleen).
Now, it would have been easy--and completely understandable--for the
Ephrons to completely mirror _Sleepless_'s proven formula to the letter,
but they manage to come up with some wrinkles that are often as
unpredictable as they are funny.  The biggest deviation from _Sleepless_ is
the increased interaction of Hanks and Ryan, who spent most of their last
collaboration apart--which called into question if the two truly had any
chemistry.  _Mail_ proves once and for all that Hanks and Ryan are a screen
duo for the ages, equally convincing trading comic barbs or longing
glances.  Their sparring sessions have real bite, and their more mellow
moments are so warmly tender that only the coldest hearts won't be at least
slightly moved.
This isn't to say that the film doesn't make a concession to what has
become the Ryan romantic comedy formula--namely, a man she is already
attached to, here in the form of Greg Kinnear's politically-minded reporter
Frank Navasky.  The new rub here is that Frank, while a bit stuck on
himself, is a nice guy and a much more appealing romantic choice than
ruthless businessman Joe, who, in turn, already has a partner of his own:
Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), who works at a publishing house.  While the
nice and perky Kathleen is clearly better than the ever-frantic Patricia,
it is easy to see why Joe would be with her; her high social station makes
for a "comfortable" choice, and it is in line with his hard-as-nails
attitude--which, of course, hides the truly gentle soul that he bears only
to "Shopgirl."
Similarly, Hanks does a bang-up job playing (to use Joe's term) a "pill,"
but he has a natural gentleness that he buries just deep enough and
gradually brings to surface as the film progresses.  Ephron has said that
_Mail_'s central question is "Can Mr. Wrong turn out to be Mr. Right?" and
that evolution is made involving and convincing by Hanks, who instead of
making Joe's progression from black to white, makes it a more realistic
shift between opposite shades of grey.
Again, though, _Mail_ is ultimately the glowing Ryan's show.  Her Kathleen
is fun and more than a little (hilariously) pathetic at times, but her
flightiness is grounded in real, complex emotion.   This is especially the
case in one late shot of her face, which displays surprise, disgust, anger,
and ecstatic, teary delight--all in a matter of seconds.  If that's not a
difficult acting task, I don't know what is--and it comes to Ryan as second
nature.
Cynics will probably dismiss _You've_Got_Mail_ as disposable fluff for
suckers for shamelessly romantic hokum.  If that truly is the case--and,
admittedly, there's no evidence to suggest otherwise--then I wear the title
of "sucker" with pride.

"Average Joe" Barlow
        "You've Got Mail," the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan extravaganza,
strikes a chord somewhere between 'engaging romantic comedy' and
'shameless product placement,' with very little manuvering room on
either side.  Not since "The Wizard," the late '80s film starring
Fred Savage and a bunch of Nintendo games, have I seen a movie so
determined to inspire consumer spending (in this case, the America
Online service).  It's one thing to have a character use a real-world
product in a film; it's quite another to have the film grind to a halt
while the product is shamelessly promoted by the characters.
        It's true that product placement, the process by which
vendors pay movie studios big bucks to get their wares up on the
screen for a fleeting moment or two, is a neccessary evil, allowing
the studios to offset the cost of shooting their latest $100 million
blockbuster.  If Hollywood can make an additional million dollars by
having Bruce Willis wear an Adidas cap in one scene, they're gonna
go for it.  I can understand this practice (even if I don't like it)
in an expensive effects-laden film.  I'm less eager to accept it in a
romantic comedy.  There are no special-effects costs to offset here.
        Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) are both booksellers
in modern-day Manhattan.  Kelly is the owner of The Shop Around the
Corner, an intimate childrens' bookstore founded by her mother, which
has been serving the New York community for thirty years.  The store
is Kelly's passion: she knows every customer by name, and is
intimately familiar with each and every book on her shelves.  Nothing
gives her greater joy than helping a customer find just the right
selection.
        Joe is the manager of Fox Books, a mammoth Barnes and
Noble-type retail outlet which opens down the street from Kathleen's
store.  Soon the new arrival has usurped all her old business, and The
Shop Around the Corner teeters on the brink of bankruptcy.  Seeking
advice and reassurance, Kelly turns to the same place many people go
when they seek comfort: cyberspace.
        For quite a while, Kathleen has been corresponding with a
friendly guy she met in an AOL (America Online, for the uninitiated)
chat room.  Over the past several weeks they've become good friends,
but they have one unusual stipulation in their friendship: they don't
want to share any personal information with each other, including
their real names.  They address each other only be their handles
(Kathleen is SHOPGIRL; he is NY152).  Naturally, Kathleen's e-mail
buddy turns out to be none other than Joe Fox, her arch-enemy in
real-life.  The rest of the film chronicles their adventures as the
two engage in their inevitable descent into amour.
        Forgetting the issue of product placement, the biggest problem
I had with this movie is the lack of intimacy on the part of our two
protaganists.  Surely anyone who is as smitten as both Hanks and
Ryan's characters are would not be content to keep their e-mail on
such a cold, distant level, never opening up or revealing any personal
details about themselves.  (In fact, I question whether people truly
*can* become infatuated with each other when no personal details are
known.  Perhaps in real life, when physical beauty can make up for a
lack of information, but not in cyberspace.  Let me know your thoughts
on this subject, dear readers.)  The fact that they refuse to share
anything personal about each other, even their real names, positively
reeks of "forced plot contrivance"; ie, a screenplay that forces its
characters to do something that makes little or no sense, simply
because there would otherwise be no story.
        Director/co-writer Nora Ephron, who also worked with Hanks and
Ryan in "Sleepless in Seattle," based her screenplay on the Jimmy
Stewart classic, "The Shop Around the Corner" (in which the two
characters fall in love via postal letters, rather than e-mail).  If
her screenplay is a little heavy-handed at times, her direction is
quite adequate, and she coaxes strong, confident performances from the
entire cast.  Particularly fun is Parker Posey ("The House of Yes"),
who appears briefly as Hanks' girlfriend.  Greg Kinnear also appears
as Ryan's sweetheart, and is entertaining with his character's
puffed-up self importance.
        "You've Got Mail" is neither the best or worst of the current
crop of holiday films.  Occasionally simple-minded and perhaps fifteen
minutes too long, it is nonetheless light-hearted, and admittedly kind
of fun (particularly after Hanks discovers Ryan's identity, and
chooses to keep her in the dark a while longer).  Significantly, this
movie is one of the few non-animated films in recent memory to earn a
family-friendly PG rating.  And I hate to adopt the cliche', but I'm
hard-pressed to think of a better 'date' movie.

I have always admired writer-director Nora Ephron's efforts, as mild
as some were, such as "Heartburn" and "This is my Life." "Sleepless in
Seattle" is one of her best, a sophisticated romantic comedy with
allusions to old movie classics such as "An Affair to Remember" and
"The Wild Bunch." It had the innate, likable pairing of Meg Ryan and
Tom Hanks and some delightful zingers courtesy of Rosie O'Donnell. The
surprise is that "You've Got Mail" is even better - as romantically
pure and cleverly funny as you can imagine, and Hanks and Ryan are
back in roles they were born to play.
Hanks stars as the aggressive Joe Fox, the owner of a Borders-type
bookstore called "Fox Books" where they serve cappuccinos and
thousands of books for discount prices. His business is the type to
put any real literary bookstore out of business, including "The Shop
Around the Corner" - a children's bookstore run by Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan). Kathleen holds this precious commodity dearly to her heart, and
it is practically around the corner from Fox Books. Distracting her
from her business is her laptop computer, which she regularly uses to
talk to an anonymous male friend through the wonders of e-mail. She
has a regular rapport with this friend, and patiently waits for her
beloved, a writer for The New York Observer (Greg Kinnear), to leave
for work before she rattles around her computer. Only, she's not aware
that her e-mail buddy is her competitor Joe Fox!
Of course, Joe is unaware of this himself, and regularly waits to go
online until his girlfriend, a book editor (Parker Posey), leaves for
work. The e-mails mount as they both write to each other, seeking help
about their business prospects. And never shall the twain meet, though
we constantly hope that they do.
Nora Ephron is the perfect writer for such lightweight nonsense, but I
was surprised how sophisticated and clever the dialogue was. Joe's
double entendres hit a 10 on the laughometer - the best scene is when
he visits Kathleen's bookstore and tries to prevent his kids from
saying "F-O-X". There are also the witticisms of supporting
characters, such as Joe's philandering father (Dabney Coleman) and his
philandering grandfather (John Randolph), who describes women as being
"enchanting"; his loose, Chris Tucker-ish executive pal (Dave
Chappelle); and Kathleen's old bookkeeper friend (Jean Stapleton), who
remarks that her last boyfriend "ran Spain". These characters are so
joyous and entertaining to watch that they are partly responsible for
making "You've Got Mail" such a success.
Ephron has less success with Joe and Kathleen's better halves. Parker
Posey, one of the ubiquitous queens of independent film, is given
little to do and is too boring and insipid to inspire much interest -
no wonder Joe is less than enthralled by her presence. This is partly
true of Greg Kinnear's character, though he is given a little more
leverage by Ephron and is allowed some sparkling zingers at a cocktail
party scene with Posey.
Another mild flaw in "You've Got Mail" is the relentless number of
oldies playing on the soundtrack - how many times do we need to hear
"Rockin' Robin"? The only reason so many immaterial songs appear on
the soundtrack is so that they can make more sales at record
stores. Only the inclusion of Harry Nilsson's "Over the Rainbow" feels
justified.
The center of "You've Got Mail" is the movie star combo of Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan, and they are as delightful and adorable a pairing as
James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were, or Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell. Hanks is surefooted as he switches subtly from being charming
and likable to mean and comically furious. Ryan is, for once, not too
bubbly or cute and handles her comedic scenes with flair and good
timing. Her last scene, where her eyes fill with understanding, hope
and regret, is stunning to watch. Combine that with Ephron's crisp,
often hilarious dialogue, and "You've Got Mail" makes for one of the
best romantic comedies since "When Harry Met Sally."

Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, David Chappelle, Dabney
Coleman, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn
Director: Nora Ephron
Screenplay: Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron
Australian theatrical release: December 26, 1998
On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars
At this point in time, no director has been able to make standard
computer screens look interesting in a movie.   I'm not talking about
spooky virtual reality (Disclosure) or warped cyber space (Hackers); I
mean actual, I-got-it-at-Dick-Smith screens.  You may remember when
Whoopi Goldberg energetically conversed on an ancient computer in
Jumping Jack Flash, or when Tom Cruise battered away on a laptop for a
brief period in Mission: Impossible.  There is just nothing interesting
about watching somebody read text off a screen, just so they can say it
out loud to save the audience from reading it themselves.
What is interesting is the prospect of finding love on the Internet.
There is a number of intriguing ideas which could have been developed in
You've Got Mail - having a chat room as a metaphor of society, examining
the net as a means to escape modern life, or how the online world is
just as vulnerable as the real world.  But director Nora Ephron's
(Sleepless in Seattle) only intention is to keep the film smaltzy and
simplistic.  She avoids any opportunity to study the medium in which the
film's protagonists use to communicate; instead, she studies the
protagonists themselves.  Ordinarily that would be fine, but Tom Hank's
character is boring, ditto for Meg Ryan's.
Two Internet geeks converse over email and chat rooms, and eventually
discover that they are in love with each other.  But these are not geeks
who wear thick rimmed glasses and are twenty pounds overweight - they
are in the cute form of Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan).  Fox
owns Manhattan's largest book chain, and when he opens a new superstore
it threatens to destroy Kelly's small bookstore "The Shop Around the
Corner."  In "real life," these two are sworn enemies, but over the
Internet - unaware of who they are conversing with - they share intimate
details of their lives.
So what we have is a film with uninteresting central characters, no
opportunities to explore their obsessive usage of email, and a film as
meaningful as a Pamela Anderson home movie.  If not for a few strong
(but repressed) performances and some occasional touching moments,
You've Got Mail could have easily infected the holiday season with the
Very Bad Filmmaking virus.  Although, it must be said that some viewers
will have no problem enjoying the central romance (judging from the
squealing girls sitting in front of me, I'd say it would be most enjoyed
by females aged 12-18), and for most, You've Got Mail will be hard to
hate.  For me, it was hard to like.

    As I write the review for the new Hanks/Ryan romantic comedy YOU'VE 
GOT MAIL, I am acutely aware that I am typing it on a computer and 
sending it a billion miles away on the Internet.  I am also aware that I 
have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid 
commercial for America Online.  And I wonder: is that so bad?  Well, the 
commercial part is.  As for the movie, well, as long as I can watch Tom 
Hanks and Meg Ryan, I think I'll be okay.
To paraphrase James Berardinelli, whose reviews I admire very much, 
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan can act.  They are both wonderful, but for all of 
Hanks' glorious work in serious films, such as his magnificent 
performance in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and his glorious triumph in 
PHILADELPHIA, I like him best when he's suitably obnoxious.  Tom Hanks 
is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going 
to get the girl: the only question is how? 
Meg Ryan, America's high school sweetheart, can act.  She's had a 
handful of memorable performances, including the great scene in the 
diner in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY ( I must not mention what she does, due to 
the, well, um, you get the idea, and if you don't, get the movie-- 
fantastic).  But, I like her best when she's, well, perky.  She is so 
adorably perky/cute that together with Hanks, they are the most amazing 
onscreen duo in my short lifetime.  Some people have them going back to 
really old classic romantic couples, but I don't really know.  All I 
know is that I just like them both.  They have such wonderfully kinetic 
chemistry that's really hard to resist, and I'm not going to even try.  
They're just really, really cute, sweet, and charming.
Hanks and Ryan collaborate once again with Nora Ephron, who directed 
them in the megahit SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Here, the setup is a little 
different.  Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) owns a small children's bookstore 
which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her.  She is 
successful, beautiful, and dates a well-known columnist with very 
radical idea (Kinnear).  She is also having an affair, of sorts.  You 
see, Kathleen, with the handle SHOPGIRL, is secretly emailing NY152.  
They have a strictly un-detailed relationship: there are no specifics, 
and they have no idea who each other is. 
NY152 happens to be Joe Fox (Hanks), a multimillionaire bookseller 
who is the heir to the fortune of the Fox chain of mega-bookstores, run 
by his father (Coleman).  Fox Books has decided to open a store on the 
West Side, right across from a little children's bookseller named "Shop 
Around the Corner", run by a perky girl named Kathleen Kelly.  Every 
morning, these two email each other silly, and every day, they fight "to 
the death!!".  It's a charming premise, and one that works nicely, 
balancing the immense troubles Kathleen is in with the romance she wants 
to have.  It also has the great sense of being a classic romance: there 
is no "let's have sex tonight" mantra, if you'll excuse my bluntness.  
This is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love. 
Hmm.  Well, the movie goes through twists and turns, having some sad 
moments and happy ones, until at one moment Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan "hook 
up", to use modern terminology, and kiss their way into happiness.  You 
know it's going to happen, the question is now?  Thankfully, Ephron has 
a wonderful supporting cast with Posey, Kinnear, Chappelle, and a host 
of others, including a great scene involving brothers, aunts, and two 
sweet kids.  It's all cute and wonderful, and for all of the idealism, 
it makes me feel good.  Hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and 
as warm on the inside as he always is.  He is, I believe, America's 
greatest actor.  Does he show it here?  Nah.  But he's still Tom Hanks, 
and she's still Meg Ryan.
Which is what this movie boils down to.  It's pure confection.  All 
the bits about THE GODFATHER, the jokes, the superb script, it's all 
really sweet.  There are some immense flaws, like pacing.  The last 
third of the movie really doesn't work as well as I would have liked, 
and for a romantic comedy, it's slow.  Once Hanks knows the secret, it 
gets really slow.  I even looked at my watch a couple times, to make 
sure Ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss I was waiting 
for, so that I could get home at a reasonable hour.  The other problem 
is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated.  E-mail?  When my 
kids are my age, I don't know what we'll be using.  But Hanks can do 
more with one eyeroll than anybody, and Meg Ryan just loves to dive into 
a pillow better than anyone in movie history.  They just work together, 
and it's nice to see.  It gives you, well, a smile.  The script helps 
with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious, and that always 
come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake.
I was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the 
purpose of movies was.  I've always believed that movies are very 
powerful, very powerful indeed.  You see, mankind has three abilities he 
needs to survive: the ability to think, entertain, and procreate.  
Movies can definitely do the first two, and as for the third, well, I'd 
rather not think about that.  I always thought films that made you think 
enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint, and 
that films that entertained you were good, because you forgot about your 
troubles and thought about something nice for a night.  And I was 
thinking about how incredible a year Tom Hanks has had.  Hanks was the 
driving force behind one of the year's best films in SAVING PRIVATE 
RYAN, which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone 
wonder about the world.  He's also half of the glue behind the year's 
best example of pure entertainment.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are magical, 
as is this movie.  It's a sweet, lovely affair with a technology twist.  
It may be a long commercial, but it gave me a pretty big smile on my 
face.

Since finding love on the Internet is a big 90s fad, it didn't surprise
me at all when I heard Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were starring in a remake of the
1940 film, `A Shop Around The Corner.' Also rejoining Hanks & Ryan, from
`Sleepless in Seattle,' is director Nora Ephron.
The plot is interesting, fairly original, and everything fits together
so well, it's almost like a fable. Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) owns a small
children's bookstore in New York City, aptly called, Shop Around the Corner.
Her mother started the business, and the store and its employees are her life.
Everything is going great, until a giant discount bookstore opens up close to
her shop. The store is part of a large company, named Fox Books. Joe Fox (Tom
Hanks) is one of the executives in Fox Books and Kathleen and he become fierce
business rivals.
Little do the both know that they have been communicating with each
other, under nicknames, on the Internet. After exchanging e-mails and chatting
for awhile, Joe asks to meet with her. But when he arrives at the meeting
place, he recognizes Kathleen and pretends he just happened to bump into her.
Joe's life gets complicated when Kathleen's shop starts to fail and he begins
to fall in love with her. Now he has to get her to forgive him for ruining her
business and figure out a way to tell her he was the guy on the net, all this
time.
It's a cute premise that plays out quite well. This is, in thanks,
mostly to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's great chemistry.  Whenever they are on the
screen together, sparks fly. Greg Kinnear turns in a good performance as
Kathleen's journalist boyfriend. The main drawback was its length, it runs
over two hours. Other than that, this is a great date movie; it's
entertaining, romantic, and downright likeable.

"Those are powerful words," Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) tells Kathleen Kelly 
(Meg Ryan).
He's talking about people falling in love over the Internet, and the 
familiar electronic icon - and voice - that slightly endears itself by 
imitating the real world.  Not getting mail has always made one feel 
neglected or forgotten, as shown in Kathleen's disappointment when she 
fails to receive e-mail at a crucial time from "ny152," the AOL handle 
of the person with whom she has been having an online experience.  Parts 
of "You've Got Mail" are peppered with references to correspondence, 
with paper and stamps and envelopes and messages sent via a breathing 
mail carrier.  This film reminds us that, electrons notwithstanding, 
communication is essential to human life, and it will find a way.
One reason "You've Got Mail" is so pleasant is because of its settings.  
First, New York City is portrayed as a place in bloom, the camera easing 
up through apple blossoms before it enters the windows of its attractive 
characters.  In fact we witness the changes of a few seasons, throughout 
which New York shops, parks and streets come off as charming and safe.  
The dwellings are also very desirable:  we see the opulent digs of  Joe 
Fox and the hypertense editor (Patricia Eden, played by Parker Posey) 
with whom he is shacked up.  Likewise, Kathleen stays in a wonderfully 
maintained and furnished flat with the politically outspoken columnist 
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear).  All over the apartments we see burnished 
desks, loads of books (mostly hardback, probably purchased by the inch 
by set designers!), and hosts of other belongings that give a cozy feel.  
This story, after all, is not "The Gift of the Magi."
Then there are the all-important computers. Joe and Kathleen use 
laptops, and in an enchanting (director/co-writer Nora Ephron likes that 
word, "enchanting") sequence we watch them watching their live-ins go 
off to work, clearing the coast for more romantic chatting.  The scenes 
involving sending and receiving mail are quite well done, with plenty of 
voice-overs, nice cross-cutting, and even some interior monologues that 
find their ways into words.  Nice modern touches here on the source 
story, "The Shop Around the Corner."  
It's a modern trend that drives the premise too:  Joe is the grandson of 
old Schuyler Fox (John Randolph, always a pleasure to watch), founder of 
Fox and Sons Books, a company that in the 1990's has swallowed up the 
profits of many a small independent bookshop.  When Joe first meets 
Kathleen, he is watching the young children of his father and 
grandfather (another wink at modern lifestyles), and he takes them into 
the rival bookstore to hear the story lady.  This is Kathleen in a 
damsel's conical hat and veil, reading to the enthralled kids gathered 
around the reading nook.  We hear some of her background - her 
now-deceased mother started the store in the 1950's, and started 
Kathleen working there at age six.  Her mother did things like giving a 
box of tissues to a little girl purchasing  "Anne of Green Gables";  
this customer shows up as a grown woman at the closing of Kathleen's 
shop.  Aside from a few shots of Ryan with teary eyes as she touches the 
empty counters of the vacant shop, the filmmakers should be 
congratulated for not ending this subplot happily.  Kathleen asks a wise 
employee of hers (Jean Stapleton in a too-small role), "What would my 
mother do?"  The answer is that her dead, revered mother would have no 
idea.
Of course the closing of the quaint bookshop has everything to do with 
the conflict that arises between Joe and Kathleen.  It's inevitable that 
they become acquainted, flirting subtly until she discovers his 
identity.  The feuding that starts at this point continues throughout 
most of the film, turning out delicious ironies.  When "shopgirl" takes 
up "ny152" on his offer for business advice, "ny152" tells her go "go to 
the mattresses," a line from "The Godfather" signifying a fight to the 
death.  Naturally, the advice resurfaces in a vigorous campaign that 
generates all kinds of bad publicity for the pastry-baking, discount 
book-peddling superstore owner.  The sentiment, "It's not personal, it's 
business," takes on new resonance by the end of the story.
Tom Hanks, already the owner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor, 
surely deserves another nomination for his work.  Probably it will come 
for his Captain John Miller in "Saving Private Ryan."  Hanks continues 
to earn his comparisons to Jimmy Stewart, as a leading man accomplished 
in romantic comedy as well as in heavy-themed drama.  In his tiniest 
expressions we observe how he develops his characters.  What makes Hanks 
a good deal of his money is the muscles in his face.
Similar to Joe, Kathleen also experiences a change.  She is dynamic 
because she first learns to say precisely what she wants to say, when 
she wants to say it;  then she learns that this new eloquence only makes 
her hurtful.  Ryan is best in her playful and hateful scenes with Hanks.  
Unlike Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle," there are no children caught up 
in the flawed lives of the main characters. (The supporting characters 
do the job here.)  Much of the plot, however, relies on cliches and even 
sly approval of betrayals of trust.  We know what's going to happen by 
the end of the picture, and we know we want it to happen.  What redeems 
the narrative is risk-taking.  Scenes in which Ryan sees herself as a 
girl dancing with her mother in the bookstore, and a touchy business of 
extreme dramatic irony, are powerful storytelling devices.
Thanks again to the filmmakers for keeping the situations suitable for a 
PG rating.  It's not crucial, Hollywood, to attract bigger audiences by 
dirtying your releases!  Take the family along over the holidays, but a 
huge, free-refilled bag of popcorn, and enjoy "You've Got Mail."

I hate America Online.  But that won't influence my decision to give
this movie the review it deserves, a good one.  Having had an account
with America Online for almost two years, it would have been nice to get
mail from MY one true love, found in one of their usually FULL chat
rooms.  That's assuming, of course, that she's out there.  Instead, what
I got most of all from AOL in my mail was spam.  For those of you that
don't know what that is, it refers to junk mail online.  Jean Stapleton
appears in this film and has a great line that deserves immortality.
Someone asks her if she's ever had cyber sex and she replies: "I tried
to once but all I got was a busy signal."  I love that line.  I am a
user of high bandwidth.  I just discarded the soon to become obsolete
telephone modem for a cable modem so I chuckled a bit when I saw the
dial-up system in this movie.  AOL is the match maker for the two lead
stars in this wonderfully refreshing comedy that plays out somewhat like
a Woody Allen movie in parts with its background score and observations
on diverse personalities who would only fit in in NYC because for some
people in this film, no one else in the world would tolerate them.
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan fall in love over the Internet in 'You've Got
Mail', the film that re-teams them with Nora Ephron who wrote and
directed 'Sleepless in Seattle' in 1993 which also featured Hanks and
Ryan.  This is an innocuous romantic comedy of the best kind.  It
doesn't feature any four letter words or people jumping into the sack at
a moment's notice, not that there's anything wrong with doing that in
movies if the situations and/or character development calls for it, but
it's nice to see a refreshing change here.  It's a movie you can not
only take your sweetheart to see but your mother and grandmother as
well.
Meg Ryan plays a book shop owner who inherited her store from her mother
after she died and runs it with close sentimentality and has a small
number of employees working for her and chief among them are Jean
Stapleton and Steve Zahn.  The bookstore is her life and not a bad one
at that as we discover in the film that she brings in about $350,000 a
year doing it.  Unfortunately, a super store is opening just up the
street, offering discounts, unlimited reading time for customers to
browse and other incentives that will put her small business out in the
cold.  It's chiefly run by Tom Hanks who shares the business with his
filthy rich father (Dabney Coleman) and Hanks is also in a relationship
with a woman whom he really can't stand.  Ryan's love interest (Greg
Kinnear), is a self made phony.  The philosopher type who thinks he
knows what makes people happy.
It just so happens that Hanks and Ryan, from the beginning of the film,
before we find out anything about them, exchange e-mail and slowly fall
in love with each other with predictable but pleasant and entertaining
results.  Not knowing that they are business rivals through their e-mail
and chats online makes you look forward to how their conflicts will be
resolved when or if they find out about each other.
What I liked most of all in this film is the way Meg Ryan's character
comes into fruition.  She's the best thing in the movie and while she
deserved Oscar nominations for her work in 'When Harry Met Sally',
'Sleepless in Seattle' and 'Courage Under Fire', she never got one.  I
hope she gets nominated for this movie.  Tom Hanks plays his part very
well and doesn't lose to Ryan by much and while his character can be
perceived as a villain to some extent, his character grows on you and
you find out that he's really a decent guy.  Not original but extremely
pleasant, 'You've Got Mail' reaches out and does exactly what the
Internet does: it touches people on a global level and with that much
variety, there's no excuse for not finding YOUR true love.

In 1940 Ernst Lubitsch directed a memorable film entitled `The Shop
Around the Corner'.  It starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan as
lonelyheart penpals in a Budapest notions shop.  In 1949 is was remade by
MGM as a musical starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson entitled `In the
Good Old Summertime'.  Then it became the Broadway musical `She Loves Me'.
Bringing it up to the computer age, You've Got Mail stands on its own as
an original story, not as merely a re-make.  Two people accidentally
meeting in cyberspace is not the same as lonelyheart penpals.  These two
did not go looking for someone out of desperation.  Each is supposedly
happy with a significant other.  
Joe Fox [Hanks], the scion of a mega-bookstore family, lives with
Patricia Eden [Posey] a dynamic woman executive.  Kathleen Kelly [Ryan],
the owner of `The Shop Around The Corner', is in a relationship with Frank
Navasky [Kinnear] Each of them have frustrations in their lives and they
find a little bit of solace in each other when on the Internet.  There is
no intention to meet, or to break up their relationships.  Each day they
pass within footsteps of each other, not realizing that she is `Shopgirl'
or that he is `NY152', their Internet names.
There are so many interesting sub-plots in the film.  The Fox family
would be the basis of a hilarious movie on their own.  And, there's the
love story involving Birdie [Stapleton] and her Spanish lover.  Each and
every character is well presented.  You care about them all.  When the Fox
family causes the demise of Kelly's bookstore, you are genuinely concerned
about the future of the employees.  
The film's ending doesn't hit you over the head as to what course their
lives will take, but you can figure it out all by yourself.  Brinkley is a
nice touch, too.
It will be referred to as a `chick' movie, or a date movie, but it is
truly a good, old-fashioned love story.  I could see it over and over, on
TV.   I give it a B+.

You've Got Mail: Summary and Critique
You've Got Mail is the latest romantic comedy directed by Nora Ephron,
and starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and is an update of the 1940 film
The Shop Around the Corner.   Ryan plays Cathleen Kelley, owner of  a
children's bookstore started by her mother, and called "The Shop Around
the Corner";   Hanks plays Joe Fox,  grandson in the firm of Fox & Sons,
which is about to open a mega-book mart literally around the corner
(think Borders or Barnes &  Noble).  Meanwhile, the two have also been
carrying on an anonymous email romance they keep secret from their
respective partners-Greg Kinnear as a pompous luddite political
columnist, and Parker Posey woefully underused as a book editor who
"makes coffee nervous."   When Hanks drops in at the children's
bookstore one day with his eight year old aunt (his grandfather's
daughter) and his 4 year old half brother (product of his father's
latest romance), some romantic sparks fly between the leads,  and he
declines to tell her his last name, keeping secret his role as the
competition.  At first, Kelley  thinks Fox books won't affect her
business, and she certainly  has no principled objection to large
corporations (both protagonists  get their morning coffee at Starbuck's,
and the movie has been described as an infomercial for AOL).  But when
her shop starts to suffer, she mounts a publicity campaign against the
commercial giant, and the two booksellers become increasingly
antagonistic off-line, even as he gives her business advice on-line.
When they arrange to meet, he doesn't tell her that he is, in fact, the
man she's been corresponding with.  After she closes her shop because of
plummeting sales, he continues to woo her both via email and in person.
By the time she has begun writing a children's book, and acknowledges
that change is all for the best, both have broken up with their previous
partners, and they finally kiss at the film's conclusion.
 You've Got Mail has gotten mixed reviews-one paper titled theirs
"You've Got Treacle"-but even those less than enthusiastic have  tended
to neglect the politics of the film.  We are in an era of increasing
corporate consolidation that is reshaping media as well as other
capitalist enterprises-Disney owns ABC, Time Warner owns Turner
Broadcasting, and Bertelsmann, the German-based owner of Bantam
Doubleday Dell, has signed an agreement to buy Random House.    This
makes the German based company the largest publisher of English-language
books in the world, controlling 25% of adult trade publishing in the US
.  Such major corporate mergers tend to result in a significant decline
in the number of "midlist" titles published and a decline in the
diversity of titles and voices published (Feminist Bookstore News Spring
1998).  Moreover, in 1998 the ABA (American Booksellers Association) and
a number of independent bookstores  filed a lawsuit against Borders and
Barnes &  Noble, charging  unfair and illegal business practices.  Among
other problems, the suit notes that as chain superstores gain dominance,
book prices rise: Barnes & Noble  and Borders no longer offer discounts
on most books, and their business practices-including insistence on
special deals and slow payment- drive up the list price of books from
which any discount is calculated.  A serious issue in the consolidation
of media, then, is the narrowing of the range and accessibility of
written  discourse.  In You've Got Mail, however, the only real
criticism offered of the superstore is that the salespeople it hires are
insufficiently knowledgeable-a problem easily remedied by hiring some
of  those thrown out of work by the competition.
Moreover, even the movie's transient nostalgia for small business
obscures the fact that as a capitalist enterprise it is by definition
exploitive, extracting surplus labor from writers, printers, bindery
workers, and so on.  The film is accurate, at least, in its suggestion
that the logic of capitalism means that books are commodities, and the
unchecked market leads to increasing monopolization.  You've Got Mail
resembles other recent cinematic representations of corporate growth in
feminizing the small business (a children's bookstore founded by a woman
and run by her daughter) and masculinizing the large corporation.
Moreover, although Fox & Sons is a family business of sorts, the
repeated marriages and late-in-life childrearing of grandfather and
father Fox indicates their failure in stable family values.  Joe,
however, is evidently supposed to be humanized by his discovery of a
soulmate in the incredibly sweet Cathleen Kelley.  (Even after he's
driven her out of business, she feels guilty about speaking harshly to
him.)  He also has a friendly dog and a black buddy/employee, and his
seductive powers are never problematized.  Early in the film, he talks
with the manager of the not yet open superstore, and points out that
they will seduce the customers.  Later, he charms an irritated grocery
clerk, and ultimately, of course, charms Kelley.   She offers no
objection to the discovery that he has known for the last third of the
film that she is the "Shopgirl" of their email correspondence,  and has
withheld that information (surely an unfair if not illegal romantic
practice).  And  of course, she completely forgives him for his business
practices.
Love trumps politics.  The Greg Kinnear character (the journalist
boyfriend) is the only one who seems to express any political views, and
is something of a buffoon.  Ryan's character, in contrast, reports that
she forgot to vote in the last election because she was getting a
manicure.  The small store's bookkeeper, played by Jean Stapleton,
reports blandly that she had an affair with Franco in the 1960s.  Even a
fascist dictator, apparently, can be lovable (what's next?  Pinochet as
romantic hero?).
Joe quotes The Godfather as the source of all wisdom, but the idea that
capitalism is organized crime is neglected in favor of the cuteness of
his love of cinema.  Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice is used as a
justification for her forgiveness of him, and indeed, that novel is
ultimately about the heroine's insertion into the property structure.
In the 1940 Shop Around the Corner, on which You've Got Mail is based,
the Jimmy Stewart character is senior clerk at Matusheks' leather-good
store.  He doesn't want to hire  Margaret Sullavan; but she sells a
cigarette-case/music box that the owner particularly likes, so Matushek
hires her.  The story is set in Budapest, and there is discussion among
the shop employees of how bad the economy is, how hard it is to find a
job, and how much they need to keep the jobs they have. (The shop's
record business on Christmas eve is described as the best since 1928. )
Sullavan, however, hopes soon to quit working and to marry her anonymous
penpal, whom she doesn't realize is Stewart, with whom she has a
conflicted relationship at work.  He, too, hopes to marry his anonymous
penpal, with whom he corresponds on cultural topics, to improve himself,
because he couldn't afford an encyclopedia.  But he realizes he needs a
better salary if he is going to raise a family.  Matushek, the fatherly
owner,  mistakenly thinks Stewart is having an affair with his wife,
though it's really a different salesman.  He gets fired, and Sullavan
calls him an insignificant little clerk (a castration to which Hanks is
never subject).  The owner learns the truth and  makes a suicide attempt
(his wife has chosen someone  he would not respect or desire; he has
wrongfully cast off his surrogate son-he later observes that the shop is
his real home, where he has lived most of his life, and, alone on
chistmas eve, takes out to dinner the new errand boy Rudy, who is alone
in the city, too).    Jimmy Stewart gets rehired and promoted to
manager; Pepe the errand boy is promoted to clerk; the philanderer is
fired (he has somehow "two-timed" the company; in cuckolding the boss he
has been unfaithful to his job).   After  the penpals  plan to meet in
the café,  Stewart sends a letter saying he'd seen her with such a
handsome man he stayed away; he tells her he's met the letter-writer,
who's fat, unemployed and ready to live on her salary  rather than to
support her.  She confesses she really liked Jimmy Stewart and was mean
to him only because she'd recently read a novel where the heroine, an
actress at the comedie francaise, is cruel to men and they all fall in
love with her-but she realizes her mistake was that she works not at the
comedie francaise but at Matushek's leather goods store.  In The Shop
Around the Corner, then, the central conflict is maintining masculinity
and the masculine role of provider  in an unstable economy.
 In You've Got Mail, the protagonists are competitors rather than
coworkers-a nod to women's independent entrepreneurship, perhaps.  But
Kelley thinks that her life running the bookstore has been "small"-as
though the breadth of experience can be measured by the volume of
trade.  Closing the bookstore is, she comments, like reliving her
mother's death, and the film thus suggests that women's oedipal move
from the world of the  mother to that of the fathers is a healthy and
necessary development-even if the father has, figuratively, killed the
mother.    Only by accepting and forgiving that loss can she move on to
marriage and, implicitly, to having a daughter of her own.  In turning
to writing children's books, she becomes a kind of independent
entrepreneur (though we never get to the questions of publication and
distribution), suggesting that those put out of business by large
corporations can always turn to a kind of self-employment.
Nora Ephron has apparently said in interviews that the US is no longer a
class society-and judging from the invisibility in this movie of
unemployment, poverty, and low-paid wage work, one might think she is
right.  But the portrait of the unionization battle of Borders employees
in Michael Moore's documentary The Big One tells a different story.

 In the world of writer-director Nora Ephron, everyone is witty, well-read,
well-educated about movies, and a hopeless romantic ... everyone who matters
anyhow. Characters who don't meet those qualifications are almost certain to
end up on the sidelines.
 So it is with "You've Got Mail," in which Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play
E-mail correspondents who share an intimate, anonymous relationship on-line,
punctuated by references to "Pride and Prejudice" (from her) and "The
Godfather" (from him). In cyberspace, they're Shopgirl and NY152; in
business, they're Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, rival bookstore owners who
begin feuding when Joe builds one of his Fox Books megastores steps away
from Kathleen's childrens' literature emporium The Shop Around The Corner, a
New York staple for 42 years.
 Neither Joe nor Kathleen knows who they're writing to, since they met in a
chatroom and have been intentionally vague about their identities. Thus,
they have no clue they're spilling their deepest secrets to someone they
regard as an enemy.
 If you thought Hanks and Ryan were endearing in their previous teamings in
"Sleepless In Seattle" and "Joe Versus the Volcano," you ain't seen nothing
yet. "Mail" allows them to work up a bit of friction and to hurl a few
zingers at each other, yet neither star has ever seemed more appealing. Even
when he's being snide, Hanks manages to retain his cuddliness, and though
Ephron pushes the "cute" button a bit vigorously with too many shots of
Ryan's shadowboxing -- she looks about as tough as the Robber Kitten --  no
director makes Ryan look lovelier than Ephron.
 The dialogue is predictably punchy, with the best lines charitably divided
amongst all the movie's major players, including Parker Posey as Joe's
girlfriend, a power-mad publisher who notes when an associate dies, it
"makes one less person I'm not speaking to," and Greg Kinnear as Kathleen's
beau, a columnist whose language can be best described as over the top.
"You're a lone reed, standing tall, waving boldly in the corrupt sands of
commerce," he gushes as Kathleen organizes her crusade against Fox.
 Although one of the biggest laughs from the audience came when they saw how
easily and quickly Kathleen and Joe accessed America On-Line, "Mail" also
features a wonderfully weird joke about Joe's relatives, a welcome
appearance by Steve Zahn as one of Kathleen's slightly daft employees, and a
terrific set-piece involving Kathleen's embarassment in a check-out line;
it's easily the sharpest scene of this type since Debra Winger's similar
run-in with a haughty clerk in "Terms of Endearment." So smooth and engaging
is "Mail" that even when its plot stalls it doesn't seem like time is being
wasted. If everyone on the Internet were this much fun to spend time with as
these characters, no one would ever log off.

By this time, everyone knows that in these kinds of movies (romantic
comedies) the two main characters will be together by the film's end.
The question though is: Will the journey to that point in the film be
interesting enough?  In the case of You've Got Mail, the answer to
that is sadly "not really".
You've Got Mail reteams Sleepless in Seattle co-stars Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan with director Nora Ephron for a remake of the 1940 James
Stewart classic The Shop Around the Corner.  In this modern retelling,
Ryan is a small book store owner in New York City who faces
competition from a multi-millionaire's (Tom Hanks) new book megastore
which opens up down the street from her.  The two square off in real
life, but little do they know that they are actually in love with each
other thanks to their anonymous communications via email.
As far as the film goes, everything seems rather distant and
uninvolved.  The original seemed to have much more emotion and depth
to it, and you would think a remake would only take things further.
Instead, everything seems slightly contrived and lacking real emotion.
I enjoyed Tom Hanks performance, as it seems I always do, but I'm
getting tired of seeing Meg Ryan play the exact same person in every
single movie she's in, that character being "the sweet girl involved
with the wrong guy".  You'll wish there was more time to devote to the
supporting cast, particularly Greg Kinnear who vanishes mid-way
through the film without any explanation whatsoever.  He's the "wrong
guy" dating Meg Ryan's character... who by the way is never really
made to look like the "wrong guy".  He's a little odd, but definately
not a bad guy in any way, shape, or form.  And independent film queen
Parker Posey... what on earth is she doing in an actual studio film
that people will see?
A quick note about the score for the film.  It sounds exactly like the
music in our local Winn-Dixie grocery store commercials that everytime
the main theme would play, I'd recite the words for the store's jingle
in my head.  It was a minor annoyance to me, but I'm positive no one
else in the country picked up on it.
You've Got Mail is available on DVD from Warner Home Video.  It
contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Special
features on the DVD include the HBO First Look:A Conversation with
Nora Ephron documentary, a video tour of various locations in New York
City's upper west side, a feature length audio commentary with
writer-director Nora Ephron and producer Lauren Shuler Donner, an
alternate music only audio track, the usual cast and crew info and
production notes, and TWELVE theatrical trailers (two for this film,
one for the 1940 original The Shop Around The Corner, one for it's
remake In the Good Old Summertime, and eight for other films you might
enjoy, like Joe vs. the Volcano, Tin Cup and Message in a Bottle).
The DVD also contains a plethora of DVD-ROM features, but since I do
not have DVD-ROM access (and am pretty much against the concept
anyway) I'm not really going to go into any of them here.
The audio commentary for the film is pretty bland in my opinion, since
Nora Ephron just doesn't exactly ooze enthusiasm.  Producer Donner
does seem fairly excited to talk about the film, but 1) she sounds
like she's not wearing a microphone and is hovering behind Ephron in
the recording studio, and 2) Ephron cuts her off and talks over her on
numerous occasions.  Add all that to the fact that they're talking
about a movie that just didn't do a whole lot for me and you've got
one mediocre commentary.  The HBO documentary is equally blah, as it's
mainly just a sit down interview with Nora Ephron.  Although, the
documentary does have one highlight: there's a quick scene in it
that's not in the film itself with Meg Ryan and Greg Kinnear sitting
in a movie theater.  Had it been kept in the final cut I would call it
my favorite moment in the film.  [PG]

Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, the owner of the cute children's book store, Shop
Around The Corner.  It is a business that has been going on for years, and was
previously owned by her mother.  Kathleen is a sweet, funny, nice type of
person who loves kids.  One of her favorite things to do is log on to American
Online.  Her screen name is ShopGirl.  She chats with someone named NY152 every
day, and they are the greatest of friends.  They don't go into specifics, but
they just have a simple friendship.  But now, The Shop Around The Corner is
having a problem.  A store called Fox Books has moved in right across the
street!  It is owned by Joe Fox. (Tom Hanks) This store is huge, with many
floors of books and magazines.  Their goal is to put every bookstore in New
York City out of business.
Joe Fox also loves American Online.  There, he chats with a girl named
ShopGirl.  They are the best of friends but they don't take their friendship
into specifics.  He knows nothing about her.  His screen name is NY152.  He
meets Kathleen Kelly at The Shop Around The Corner when he is trying to buy out
their inventory of books that Fox Books doesn't have.  He simply states his
name is Joe.  They continue to meet around the city and she discovers that he
is Joe Fox, the man that is going to put her out of business.  The two of them
still don't know that they are in love on America  Online.  They fight and
fight and fight whenever they see each other.  These arguments are quite
humourous.  
NY152 asks ShopGirl if they should meet.  They plan to meet at the Coffee Shop.
 ShopGirl is waiting and waiting at a table with a present for NY152.  When
NY152 discovers that ShopGirl is Kathleen Kelly, he freaks out, for he is Joe
Fox.  He enters the coffee shop not telling her who he is.  He simply sits down
and annoys her to death. He doesn't mean to, but she takes it that way.  Now
that he knows that they are actually perfect for each other, he is extra nice
to her.  The next day he brings her flowers and stays in her apartment and
chats with her for awhile. Eventually, he asks ShopGirl to meet again over
America Online.  They do, and they discover that they were in love the entire
time.  Kathleen simply states "I wanted it to be you."
You've Got Mail is a nice, cute movie with some good laughs.  Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan are so wonderful together.  Both did great jobs of acting.  You've Got
Mail shows that sometimes if you look beyond the business in people, they may
be just right for you.  Although at some points in the movie, it seemed a
little slow, the overall product was great.  Warner Brothers is out of the
slump and definitely has a hit.  America Online is supporting this movie a
great deal.  They even have a feature where you can E-Mail Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan under their screen names in the movie.  Parker Posey, Dave Chapelle, and
Greg Kinnear also have smaller supporting rolls.  Parker Posey plays Joe's
girlfriend, Dave Chapelle plays his friend, and Greg Kinnear plays Kathleen's
boyfriend.  The bottom line: Not Oscar Material, but a wonderful movie for all
of you AOL lovers out there.

One of the oldest adages in Hollywood is:  find a good formula and stick
with it.  So, hoping for another Sleepless in Seattle, writer/director
Nora Ephron has once again teamed up with stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
for a cutely sentimental romantic comedy, You've Got Mail.
Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) runs The Shop Around the Corner, an
independent children's book store in New York.  Her store specializes in
personal attention and service...but it is being threatened by the new
Fox Books superstore which is opening down the street.
Kathleen seeks comfort from an online friend she met in a chat room on
the internet.  She anonymously falls in love with this charming,
complete stranger.  But, unbeknownst to her, her online love is none
other than her arch-rival, Joe Fox, of Fox Books fame.  And neither does
Joe Fox know that his online paramour is the troublesome Kathleen Kelly,
chief crusader against the presence of his chain bookstore.
Both Joe and Kathleen are currently involved in relationships.  Kathleen
is attached to a self-obsessed columnist (Greg Kinnear), and Joe is
living with a hyperactive publisher (Parker Posey).  But they are
relationships without passion...unlike what Joe and Kathleen find with
each other online.
Nora Ephron deftly takes the formula from Sleepless in Seattle, and
makes a few minor substitutions (such as, instead of An Affair to
Remember and The Dirty Dozen, You've Got Mail uses Pride and Prejudice
and The Godfather to illustrate the dichotomy between the sexes).  The
end result is familiar, yet pleasant.
The reason the film uses that formula is simple:  it works. Both Ryan
and Hanks cutely emit waves of niceness wherever they go. It's hard not
to like their characters, and you instinctively want them to be
together.
The film's overall plotline is inconsequential in the grand scheme of
things...it's merely there to provide enough obstacles so Meg Ryan and
Tom Hanks don't hook up too soon.  But for an inconsequential plotline,
it is handled well.  The film smartly avoids painting either Ryan or
Hanks as the villain in the bookstore battle (though the film does seem
to favor the "independent" side).  And there are plenty of interesting
little subplots that keep the whole thing from becoming tedious.
In addition to good performances by Hanks and Ryan, the film boasts a
plenitude of above-par supporting turns.  Kinnear and Posey are likable
as the alternative romantic interests...even though they're not
perfectly matched with Ryan and Hanks, we can understand why they start
the movie together.  Steve Zahn makes a good impression as an unusual
employee at The Shop Around the Corner.  Dabney Coleman and Jean
Stapleton  aren't overwhelmed with things to do in their minor roles,
but are a welcome, recognizable presence.
You've Got Mail distills the essence of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. It's
cute, funny, nice and ever-so-appealing romantic comedy.

YOU'VE GOT MAIL (PG).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Nora Ephron
Stars: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton, 
Steve Zahn, Dave Chappelle, 
Heather Burns, Dabney Coleman, John Randolph
Running time: 119 minutes.
With the charming Sleepless In Seattle, writer/director Nora
Ephron successfully remade the '40's tear jerker An Affair To
Remember, as a vehicle for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  Ephron attempts to
recapture much of that same magic with this pleasant enough remake of
Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 comedy The Shop Around The Corner.  Based on
Nikolaus Laszlo's play Parfumerie, the film has previously been
remade, as In The Good Old Summertime, with Judy Garland.
Ephron's contemporary take on this classic tale of two shop
assistants who turn out to be pen pals updates the plot for the
computer literate '90's.  In You've Got Mail, Ephron uses the
possibilities of the internet as its central plot device.  This
sleepless in cyberspace explores how two people who regularly
communicate over the net can actually live close by and pass each
other in the street without ever knowing it.  The catch here is that
the two people who enjoy a cosy e-mail romance by night are actually
business rivals by day.  Eventually romance blossoms between the pair
as they realise that they actually have quite a lot in common.
Hanks plays Joe Fox, an entrepreneurial book dealer who runs a
chain of bookstores.  His latest superstore opens in New York, a block
away from the small book shop, quaintly known as The Shop Around The
Corner, and threatens to close this 42 year old family business.  Joe
frequently clashes with the shop's owner Kathleen Kelly (Ryan).
While rivals in business, Joe and Kathleen are already
secretly correspondents, who share a sort of intimacy through their
nightly communications in an Internet chat room.  He is known as
NY152, while she calls herself Shopgirl.  They share many of their
personal secrets and details of their daily lives.  But it is only
when Joe helps her with her business problems that the anonymity
begins to break down, and their relationship becomes more personal.
Joe has to somehow break down Kathleen's resistance before he can tell
her the truth.
Within the context of the romantic comedy, Ephron also
addresses the changing face of our society, and the clash between the
old ways of doing business and the modern way of life.  Kathleen's
boyfriend Frank (played with ease and charm by Greg Kinnear) is a
journalist who rails against technology and the corporatisation of
America from his old fashioned typewriter.  The script, co-written by
Ephron and her sister Delia, contains some nice one liners, and the
sparkling dialogue is delivered with verve by an attractive cast.
 
There is plenty of chemistry between the two charismatic
stars, teamed together for the third time.  Their easy going rapport
and laid back charm should ensure that this lesser effort is,
nonetheless, a huge hit over the Christmas holiday season.  Ryan is
vivacious and perky, and delivers her usual delightful performance.
Hanks is solid, but somehow is not as convincing as the hard hearted
businessman who discovers his humanity.  The supporting cast consists
of indie regulars Parker Posey and Steve Zahn, and their ensemble
performances add to the material's broad appeal.  You've Got Mail is
innocuous enough and quite enjoyable for the most part.  The main
problem with this light weight film is that it is overlong, and
eventually outstays its welcome.  There is a sense of unnecessary
padding, and the second half of the film becomes a little tiresome as
it limps towards its predictable conclusion.  Nonetheless, You've Got
Mail is not without appeal, and this delightful, feel good, but
occasionally saccharine romantic comedy will undoubtedly please fans
of the genre.

Director/writer Nora Ephron continues her string of carbon copied films
that began with her participation on the screenplay of one of the best
romantic comedies around, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (9/10). In 1993, she
decided to write and direct her own romantic comedy about two people
who were meant for one another, but didn't meet until the end,
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (6.5/10), a poor man's WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, in my
opinion. Now, she even goes as far as to take the same stars as
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, basically the same premise, and shines on in her
quest for complete and utter unoriginality.
PLOT:
Man and woman meet on an Internet chat line and begin a
cyber-relationship via emails back and forth. Eventually, both of them
decide that it's time to actually meet each other face to face, without
the knowledge that they are, in fact, bookstore competitors in
real-life. 
CRITIQUE:
Boring, unoriginal, long-winded rehash of two of this writer's earlier
scripts, based on the 1940 film entitled THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER,
this movie is a perfect example of what Hollywood knows to have worked
in the past, and believes will keep working in the future (i.e. will
keep making money). Take two cute and personable stars of the day, add
a fabricated smidgen of romance, a contrived tinge of comedy, a slew of
wise-cracking and one-dimensional costars, a script comprised of lines
that would only be found in a script, various beautiful shots of NY
during all four seasons, and a baby-boomer soundtrack that will just
have the audience's hair standing up in recognition factor alone, and
you've got yourself a perfect recipe for the lowest-common-denominator
type films that Hollywood keeps cranking out from year to year, without
a hint of originality or enthusiasm.
This movie is not funny, barely romantic (the last 15 minutes are okay,
but only if you want to sit through the first 105 minutes of people
typing, a lot of scripted narration and a grand sub-plot about the
corporate giant stores getting rid of the mom & pops nowadays) and not
at all inspirational or creative. Does this mean that you won't like
this movie? I don't know. All I know is that if you're at all like me,
and you believe in the all-and-mighty theory that when a film's trailer
doesn't seem "do it" for you, the film generally doesn't do it either,
then this film is not for you. Having said that, it was Mrs. JoBlo's
idea to see this movie in the first place, she who actually found this
movie's trailer to be appealing, and she was also quite bored and
uninspired with anything this film had to offer.
The actors are okay, with Meg Ryan shining once more as the
cute-as-a-button store owner, who makes you smile when she smiles, and
ache when heart aches. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job,
but between you and me, seems to have put on quite a few pounds of
late, and doesn't project much of a leading man role anymore (Remember
Brando, Tom? Put the desserts down from time to time, buddy. Trust me
on this one.) All of the secondary players are screenplay-generated
fluff parts that seem to want to be clever in every scene, and who are
generically divided into the "good clan" and the "bad clan". Nothing of
three-dimensions here, folks. The soundtrack was nice and the
cinematography beautiful at times, but these are supposed to be layers
of cream added to a solid script, not a replacement thereof. Both
elements seemed to be used in abundance whenever the script needed some
"stalling time", along various montage sequence of Hanks and Ryan
bouncing around. 
This is not a good movie. It offers no originality, very little real
humour, and even less tangible romance. One kick that I did get out of
this film, was the fact that it majestically announced the "selling
out" of yet another independent film actor, in Parker Posey, who plays
the role of one of the most one-dimensional characters that I have ever
seen on film. Congratulations Parker, you are now part of the Hollywood
mold. This film may appeal to some of you who go in with extremely low
expectations, but either way, I suggest you go out and rent WHEN HARRY
MET SALLY instead, and thank me in the morning.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
After a one-shot guest appearance on TV's "Happy Days", producer Ron
Howard asked Tom Hanks to read for a secondary part in SPLASH, and got
the lead instead. He met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson on the
set of the 1985 movie, VOLUNTEERS. They have two children together and
Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife.
Meg Ryan's full name is Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra. She is also
married to a fellow actor, Dennis Quaid, with whom she has one son,
Jack Henry. She received $10.5 million for her role in this movie.  
Nora Ephron was married to writer Carl Bernstein, the man who had "a
little bit" to do with the whole Nixon Watergate scandal. They had two
sons together, and Ephron wrote her film novel and film, HEARTBURN,
starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, based on their marriage. She
is presently married to the writer of the Martin Scorsese-helmed
GOODFELLAS (9/10) and CASINO (7.5/10), Nicholas Pileggi.
The two screenwriters of this script, Delia and Nora Ephron, are
sisters. All of Delia's movie-writing credits are associated with
projects involving her sister, Nora.
Producer Lauren Suler-Donner is the wife of the LETHAL WEAPON movies
director, Richard Donner.

Blast From the Past is a cute one-joke comedy, without the cuteness.
Its elaborate premise quickly gets wearisome, and the few amusing
moments sprinkled here and there are well short of the amount needed to
carry this lump of a film.
In the films laboriously long setup, Calvin and Helen Webber
(Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek) host a dinner party in 1962.
Calvin is a rich and brilliant, but paranoid, inventor.  When he hears
news of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he locks himself and his pregnant wife
in a luxurious underground fallout shelter...for 35 years.  The couple
has a son, Adam (Brendan Fraser), who lives his entire life in the
shelter.
Until 1997, when the locks open, and he has a chance to enter the real
world.  Sent out by his hesitant parents to seek supplies (and a wife),
Adam is very much a fish out of water in the 1990s.  Wide-eyed, innocent
and naive, Adam must confront a society that bears little resemblance to
the idyllic picture painted by his parents.
Enter Eve (Alicia Silverstone), a street-smart 90s woman.  At first,
she's not quite sure what to make of the overly-nice Adam...so, she
works out a business deal with him.  She helps him gather the supplies
the Webber family needs to last out another 35 years, but, in the
process, falls in love.
The film labors through an overly long setup.  Every single thing that
happens is an obvious attempt to lay the foundation for a future gag or
plot development. (For example, when Calvin gifts his son with
"worthless" stocks and baseball cards, you just know they'll pop up
again.)  Walken and Spacek may be game, but are painfully one-note as
the "perfect" '60s parents.
The humor in Blast From the Past is comparable to a bleak nuclear
landscape. Most of the jokes simply fizzle out before leaving the launch
pad. One of the few jokes that works involve the dimwitted owner of the
property above the fallout shelter, and his reaction to discovering the
Webber family. However, the film isn't content to leave well enough
alone, and the gag soon gets repetitive and tiring.
Brendan Fraser is seeming to make a career out of these stranger in a
strange world roles.  He certainly has the mannerisms down, and simply
radiates: "I'm a nice guy, even though I act goofy."  However, he did
the same schtick much better in George of the Jungle and Still
Breathing.
The film doesn't know quite how to handle Alicia Silverstone's Eve.
First, her introduction is hopelessly bungled.  Then, the film misfires
when it tries to add a subplot about her ex-boyfriend.  Neither of these
are written believably, and she becomes more of a plot contrivance than
an actual character.
Sometimes a one-joke comedy like Blast From the Past will surpass all
odds and actually work.  To achieve that amazing feat requires deft
comic writing, superb pacing, and tremendous performances all around.
Blast From the Past scores zero for three.  Leave this one in the
fallout shelter.

I've come to notice that I have a small defensive mechanism that
occasionally pops up when a stranger approaches me. Invariably, I
immediately make a subtle course change and try to discretely add some
distance between the other person and me as we pass one another. If
this oncoming person looks suspicious, you can bet that I'll veer even
further from my path. Maybe by doing this, I am cheating myself out of
an encounter that would have been infinitely fulfilling. I guess, in a
sense, this is why technology and the internet is bringing our world
closer together. By accessing some of these online chat rooms, for
example, it affords us a chance to talk freely with others with out
the humility of revealing our identities.  It also offers the failsafe
mechanism of turning off the computer if you feel that you've
attracted one of the many weirdoes out in cyberspace. But maybe - just
maybe - you might actually find someone that you can feel as
comfortable with as your favorite fuzzy blanket. 
Take Kathleen (Meg Ryan) and Joe (Tom Hanks). To each other in the
online world, they are best friends who are intent to preserve their
anonymity. When they are online, their lives become a rich tapestry of
conversation whose long talks about nothing allow them to reveal more
than any real face-to-face conversation ever could. Late at night or
early in the morning, when they are not in the busy nine-to-five mode,
they nestle up to their computers secretly wishing that they were
nestling with one another. They flirt, confide in one another, and
even contemplate meeting. But sometimes, relationships like these are
better left a fantasy. The cold, hard reality of this seemingly cute
bond is that in real life, they are actually enemies. Kathleen owns a
small but wonderful children's bookstore. She has a heart of gold and
is a romantic in every sense of the word. But everything that she has
worked for is being threatened when Joe's company builds a
Border's-like superstore just around the block. Despite the fact that
I would just about hate anyone that drove me out of business, Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan are infectiously cute. The way Ryan rolls her baby
blue eyes as she confesses her inner thoughts or the way Hanks bobs
his head left and right as he searches for just the right words are
real gems. And because these two are so affable, and because we're
interested in what these two have to say to each other (they mostly
talk about basically mundane things and offer small snippets of wisdom
to one another), we are engrossed with the idea of them meeting. What
will happen when they discover whom their online pen pal really is?
Where will the story go from there? And this is what really allowed me
to enjoy the film. I was never sure where the story would quite go.
And whether they actually got together or not didn't really matter
because in the end, I just enjoyed the characters so much that I would
have been happy no matter what their outcome.

   "You've Got Mail" comes across as a feathery romantic
comedy centering on two people who have each broken up
with their live-in friends and who have replaced them with
people they truly love.  This is the sort of movie that you'd
expect form Nora Ephron, who put the same actors together
five years ago in her "Sleepless in Seattle."  As sweet as
"Seattle" was, some of us wondered whether the only way to
generate old-fashioned romance in a '90s movie is to conjure
a turnout of Hollywood's Golden Age--in that case "An Affair
to Remember."  Once again, Ephron has copied the harvest
of earlier comedies: the 1940 Ernst Lubitsch film "Shop
Around the Corner," about coworkers in a Budapest notions
shop who do not realize the are lonelyhearts penpals, in turn
scripted from Nikolaus Laszlo's play "Parfumerie" which was
later musicalized as "In the Good Old Summertime," then
brought to Broadway as "She Loves Me."  
   Apparently fearing that not enough potential fans in the
U.S. would relate to a setup in a charming European city or
that they may consider a perfumery too wan to situate their
characters, Ms. Ephron updated and Americanized the old
warhorse, setting the action in her own neighborhood, New
York's Upper West Side, using internet mail as the MacGuffin
to propel the action.
   Though polls taken after the early screenings of the movie
show that young New York women, the targeted core
audience, are all weepy and smiles about the whimsical
adventures of Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan), perhaps they have no right to be--given the uneven
power relationships of the two principals.  It's not so much
that Joe is the scion of a major book baron who owns a chain
of megastores selling at deep discounts and who is
consciously driving independent shops out of business. 
That's the nature of the game.  It's more that Joe knows
something that Kathleen does not, conceals that intelligence
from her, and manipulates her into humiliating situations.
These circumstances include one in which he stands her up
and another that sees him toying with a lovely person who
should have been given full disclosure at the first opportunity.
Even worse, Kathleen responds to Joe's competitive drive
with a dislike that is not at all convincing.  She's just too
amiable to detest anybody and Joe is even more the cad for
suppressing what he knows.  In a romantic comedy we want
the two principals to get together after what is seemingly half
a lifetime of obstacles.  In this case we should want Nora
Ephron to make an exception.  We want her to frustrate Joe
in the final scene to punish him for making Kathleen's life
hell.
   As the story opens we observe that Kathleen runs a
bookstore that has been in her family for decades, one which
specializes in the sale of children's books about which the
owner knows absolutely everything.  One of her employees,
Birdie (Jean Stapleton) has been associated with her for
about as long and acts as the store's bookkeeper.  Just a
block away, Joe Fox is busy following his dad's plan to build
a megastore, one which will sell all sorts of books and
distribute them at deep discounts--which he can do because
of the economics of massive purchases.  Communicating via
AOL with a cyber partner whose identity he does not know--
and who does not realize who he is as well--he discovers that
he is reaching the very woman whose business he is
threatening.  Each time he runs into her, he chats in a
friendly manner as you'd expect from a guy who has the
superior edge.  When she learns that he is the man who will
put her shop into bankruptcy, she rebuffs him, but even then
her responses are so saccharin that you'd scarcely guess the
depth of her resentment.
   Despite the mean-spiritedness that underlies this only
seemingly dulcet story, "You've Got Mail" is a valentine to
New York's Upper West Side neighborhood, a center of
liberal, well-educated individuals who patronize a plethora of
megastores and independents as well.  The surroundings are
a perfect urban answer to the malling of America with its
variety of specialty shops, some of which are lovingly
portrayed--particularly the great Zabar's appetizer emporium
and the fairly new presence of Starbuck's.  The streets are
spotless, the residents are friendly, and those friendly
denizens include eccentrics of every variety.  They embracee
Kathleen's live-in friend Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) who
opposes all industrialization beyond the typewriter, and
Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), who in the words of her
boyfriend Joe would "make coffee nervous."  Ephron piles on
the oddities by introducing two youngsters of grade-school
age, Matt ("My father's son," says Joe) and Annabel ("My
grandfather's daughter," he adds).
   Tom Hanks no longer has the agreeable appearance he
exuded in "Sleepless in Seattle."  He is developing a double-
chin, his face rounding out unpleasantly giving him a look that
is without his signature character lines.  Meg Ryan hasn't
changed a bit, however, so that it's not surprising that in the
week of the movie's opening she is on the cover of both
People magazine and TimeOutNY.  Of the movies that have
cast her this year, "You've Got Mail," rather than "HurlyBurly,"
is perfect for her personality.  It's just unfortunate that the
script designed by Ms. Ephron and her co-writing sister Delia
Ephron allows Joe to take advantage of Kathleen's
sweetness.  This only reinforces the idea that nice girls don't
really win.  As critic Matt Zoller Seitz concludes in his New
York Press review, "It reminded me of one of those soap
opera plotlines where a woman falls in love with her rapist."

Kleszczewski, Nicholas
_You've Got Mail_ is the latest of the Nora Ephron/Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan
movies in which, like _Sleepless in Seattle_, the two lovers, are
destined for each other, but are oblivious of this fact until the very
end.  It takes place in New York, where the two both work in the book
retail biz.
Side note: I love those huge bookstore chains with comfy chairs and
capucchino. It's a great place to relax, quick-skim potential purchases,
and try one of those forbidden pastries.  I frequent them at least once
a week.
Therefore, I'm not the most objective reviewer when it comes to this
film.  Its underlying subplot is of the huge corporate chains destroying
the Mom + Pop shop.  It's not unlike those annoying op-ed pieces I've
read about how those huge megalomaniacal theater chains running the
small theaters to the ground (lessee... better seating, greater
selection, better sound...).
It's been done before, but it doesn't seem to work in current films.
_What's Eating Gilbert Grape_ comes to mind.  In that, the small grocery
store is being put out of business by the huge grocery chain (with
double coupons, one-stop shopping, ATMs, etc. etc...).  _Big Night_
comes to mind.  I think only _It's a Wonderful Life_ was the most
successful.
Let the truth be proclaimed: the consumer is ALWAYS right.  If you like
the Mom and Pop shop, GO THERE.  If it doesn't stand up to the huge
chains for the many aforementioned reasons, then those stores may just
go out of business.  Sad, but think: the former employees may find a job
that better uses their skills for the general public.
So when _You've Got Mail_ rehashes this same plot-line, I get
distracted.  Frankly, as a former New Yorker, I've never encountered a
store equal to "The Shop Around the Corner" (only in Greenwich, CT).
The popular metropolitan bookstores are the Barnes & Nobles, the
specialty bookstores (i.e. technical books, religious books), and used
books (_The Strand_, promoted in _Six Degrees of Separation_).
Why couldn't have the store's owner, Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have
transformed the shop into one of these stores?  Or better marketed it's
children's book niche?  Instead, the screenplay sells out and
has it run into a bigger issue than it has any right to be.  The
campaign for market takeover turns into a battle that goes city-wide,
with local newscasters enterring the ring.  This goes on for twenty
minutes, is futile, and other than a few chuckles, just buys time.
So we are treated to the obligatory scene where Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan) is sobbing, finally entering the chain store, and wells up in
tears when overhearing a conversation between a consumer and a
know-nothing employee.  A real cheap jab.  It is very likely the same
conversation could have occurred in _her_ store, with Steve Zahn's
character being the know-nothing employee.
Otherwise, _You've Got Mail_ is a funny, cute, romantic comedy.  Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan play characters they know well. Nora Ephron displays
an uncanny West-Side New York tone: if you can stand the occasional
stench, you'll have a good time.

Picture Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan smooching on a sunny day in a gorgeous New 
York City flower garden while "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" plays in the 
background. Imagine Jean Stapleton saying "I tried to have cybersex once, 
but I kept getting a busy signal." If the two previous sentences made 
your stomach turn, keep reading. If, on the other hand, you found the 
Hanks/Ryan image just darling and the Stapleton quip too cute for words, 
get as far away from this review as possible, because my critique of the 
insufferably cutesy-poo "You've Got Mail" will likely give you a headache.
"You've Got Mail" may be the ultimate chick flick. It wouldn't surprise 
me if the ushers required any males attending the film to check their 
balls at the door. During this excruciating exercise, I heard waves of 
female giggling, laughing and "Aww-ing," plus a hearty round of applause 
at the end. At no time did any man in the audience make a sound. Whether 
this was because they were stunned, sickened or sleeping I cannot say. 
I will say this: "You've Got Mail" will delight people who use writing 
paper with bunnies on it. I guarantee that some hack critic will describe 
the film as "a delightful, frothy holiday confection." "You've Got Mail" 
is for people who embroider toaster cozies, fasten "Garfield" cartoons to 
their refrigerators with ceramic magnets that look like food, and don't 
change the channel when that insufferable Celine Dion "Titanic" song pops 
up yet again on the radio. As for the rest of us, this is the sort of 
movie that could throw even non-diabetics into sugar shock.
Meg Ryan twinkles non-stop as the proprietor of an unbelievably quaint 
children's bookstore in Manhattan. Neighborhood kiddies sit enraptured 
when she dresses-up as the chronically-adorable "Storybook Lady" and 
reads to them, while her band of lovable rag-tag employees exchange one-
liners straight out of "Caroline in the City." At night, after Meg's 
cuddly curmudgeon boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) goes to bed, she races to the 
computer, where she waxes rhapsodic with her anonymous online guy pal. 
During an endless stream of product placements for America Online, the 
playpen for countless Internet twerps, Meg and her secret sweetie 
exchange winsome observations about life in the Big Apple ("Don't you 
love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies"). Are 
you gagging yet?
Ah, but there's trouble in Pepperland. Meg's online honey-bunny is Tom 
Hanks, an executive of a evil corporation that runs a chain of soulless 
mega-bookstores. In standard movie coincidence fashion, his next Uber-
store is slated to open, you guessed it, right next to Meg's cuddly-
wuddly shop. The two continue their online flirt-a-thon, blissfully 
unaware that in real life they are bitter business enemies. Goodness 
gracious, how ironic!
Director Nora Ephron, who teamed with Hanks and Ryan for "Sleepless in 
Seattle," co-wrote the script for this remake of "The Shop Around the 
Corner," which doesn't contain a single sentence that any actual human 
being would ever say in a million years. The painfully mannered dialogue 
plays like the first draft of a flop Neil Simon play, made even more 
irritating by Ephron's coy direction. From the first shot of Meg Ryan, 
mugging for the camera while the soundtrack plays the kind of saccharin 
music most often heard in movies with chimps or the Olsen twins, it's 
clear that Ephron is aiming this fluff at those who consider "Touched By 
An Angel" high art.
It gets even worse. Hanks enjoys a VH1 moment at a colorful street fair, 
frolicking with a couple of kids. Ryan tries to psych herself up for a 
confrontation by engaging in a cute-as-a-kitten session of shadow-boxing, 
triggering fits of tittering from the women seated around me. I could go 
on, but just writing about this noxious movie is making me woozy. 
Before anyone fires off an angry letter on their sky blue note paper with 
teddy bears on the borders, let me assure you that I am not the Grinch 
that stole Christmas. I love "It's A Wonderful Life," and the romantic 
comedy, "The Philadelphia Story," and "Local Hero," a whimsical tale 
packed with quirky characters, is one of my all-time favorite films. The 
difference between those movies and "You've Got Mail" is simple. They 
have style and class, while "You've Got Mail" is pure goo, a frilly 
Hallmark card with icing, whipped cream and a cherry on top. As soon as I 
got home from enduring this concoction, I slapped a copy of "L.A. 
Confidential" into the VCR, because exposure to a toxic offering like 
"You've Got Mail" requires a severe and immediate antidote. 
P.S. If you thought "You've Got Mail" was wonderful and are steaming over 
this review, let me ask you one question. If Tom really loved Meg and saw 
that his mega-store was about to drive her children's bookstore out of 
business, why didn't he simply stop carrying children's books and 
instruct his staff to direct customers to Meg's place? His business could 
easily withstand the minute drop in revenue, her business would continue 
to thrive and it would have been the decent thing to do. Think about that 
while you're rearranging the figurines on your toilet tank doily, girls.

This hip, contemporary remake of the Ernst Lubitsch comedy "The
Shop Around the Corner," which was based on Miklos Laszlo's
"Parfumerie," stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as two booksellers who fall
in love in the age of e-mail. She runs a small children's bookstore on
New York City's Upper West Side, while he's the scion of a huge
superchain which is putting every independent bookstore out of
business. They both buy groceries at Zabars and pick up coffee at
Starbucks, passing each other on the street, but they've never met. He
lives with a hyperactive book editor (Parker Posey) and she lives with
an erudite newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear). Yet, as they face off
against one another in their professional life, they unwittingly
romance each other, using pseudonyms as they pour out their hearts on
the web. Nora Ephron has cleverly updated the story for the electronic
age, giving the old-fashioned a fresh, new panache. "The Internet
looks infinite," she explains. "But, like a great big city, it's
really a series of villages, full of people who care about similar
things connecting with one another." While Tom Hanks is splendid, his
best bet in the Oscar derby is for "Saving Private Ryan," but isn't it
about time Meg Ryan got an Oscar nomination?  With a captivating
combination of fragility and ferocity, she makes romantic comedy look
so easy. In a supporting role, Jean Stapleton strikes a memory chord
as she sings and plays the piano.  Remember her as Edith Bunker in
TV's "All in the Family," warbling the theme in the opening credits?
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "You've Got Mail" delivers a
first-class, charming 10. What a sparkling, sweet treat! It's the most
romantic movie of the holiday season.

You've Got Mail works alot better than it deserves to. In order to make the
film a success, all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and
attractive stars, have them share the screen for about two hours and then
collect the profits. No real acting was involved and there is not an
original or inventive bone in it's body (it's basically a complete re-shoot
of The Shop Around the Corner, only adding a few modern twists).
Essentially, it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary
filmmaking. It's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy, not to
mention very manipulative. But oh, how enjoyable that manipulation is. 
But there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that
makes the movie work as well as it does, because I absolutely hated the
previous Ryan/Hanks teaming, Sleepless in Seattle. It couldn't have been
the directing, because both films were helmed by the same woman. I haven't
quite yet figured out what I liked so much about You've Got Mail, but then
again, is that really important? If you like something so much, why even
question it? 
Again, the storyline is as cliched as they come. Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox,
the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and Meg Ryan plays
Kathleen Kelley, the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run
children's book shop called, in a nice homage, The Shop Around the Corner.
Fox and Kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new Fox Books store is
opening up right across the block from the small business. Little do they
know, they are already in love with each other over the internet, only
neither party knows the other person's true identity. 
The rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a
mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen. Sure, there are some
mildly interesting subplots, but they all fail in comparison to the utter
cuteness of the main relationship. 
All of this, of course, leads up to the predictable climax. But as
foreseeable as the ending is, it's so damn cute and well-done that I doubt
any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy
as this part does. When Ryan discovers the true identity of her online
love, I was filled with such, for lack of a better word, happiness that for
the first time all year, I actually left the theater smiling.

YOU'VE GOT MAIL
(Warner Bros.)
Starring:  Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Dave
Chappelle, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, Dabney Coleman.
Screenplay:  Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron.
Producers:  Lauren Shuler Donner and Nora Ephron.
Director:  Nora Ephron.
MPAA Rating:  PG-13 (profanity, adult themes).
Running Time:  118 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     Notwithstanding its tres-90s-hip cyber-era premise -- two email chat
pals fall in love online, little realizing they already know and dislike
each other in the real world -- YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a very old-fashioned
sort of romantic comedy.  It's not just that the film is a spin on the
1940 Ernst Lubitsch comedy THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.  Actually, it's
more about the lead actors.  You see, co-writer/director Nora Ephron seems
to understand at last what the studio bosses of old understood, what she
didn't understand in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Sometimes a romance isn't 
about a concept, or a romance between characters.  Sometimes it's about a
romance between stars.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL is about a romance between Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan.
     Mind you, they do play characters in the film.  Hanks is Joe Fox,
whose family company is a chain discount bookstore; Ryan is Kathleen
Kelley, whose family business is a neighborhood children's bookstore on
Manhattan's Upper West Side just down the block from a brand new Fox
Books.  By day they're quarreling competitors, each with a fizzling
relationship -- Joe with a caffeine-fueled editor (Parker Posey), Kathleen
with a provocateur journalist (Greg Kinnear).  By night they're lonely
hearts correspondents, sharing deep thoughts on big issues.  
     YOU'VE GOT MAIL does manage to do an effective job of poking into the
appeal and the problems of online interactions.  It's easy for Kathleen
(as "Shopgirl") and Joe (as "NY152") to connect while connected, revealing
themselves more fully and more quickly in an environment where fear of
rejection is mitigated by anonymity.  At the same time, Ephron and sister
Delia use variations on the idea that "it's not personal" to show how easy
it is disconnect real people from the way we encounter them, whether in
the flesh or after a cursor.  Trust this writer -- who met his wife
online, and knows whereof he speaks -- that the Ephrons get their subject
right, right down to the embarrassment of people involved in The Love That
Dare Not Type Its Username.
     Yet even this thematic material is little more than a pleasant fringe
benefit, because YOU'VE GOT MAIL is first and foremost a chance to watch
two incredibly engaging performers together.  It only takes a few moments
watching Hanks and Ryan together to realize what SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, for
all its storybook charms, was missing:  Hanks and Ryan together.  Here
they bicker and banter, bond warily, and generally offer delights for all
who watch.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL's final half hour is an improvement over THE
SHOP AROUND THE CORNER in that it sets a stronger foundation for the
rapproachment to come, but it also means plenty of time to enjoy the
chemistry between the two stars.  Hanks is playing Hanks (smart, funny and
too-nice-for-words), Ryan is playing Ryan (smart, funny and
too-cute-for-words), and it doesn't even matter that they're not trying
very hard to create distinctive characters.  Ephron just gives them clever
things to say, and gets out of the way.
     It's nice to see Ephron show some comic instinct again after the
ineptitude of MICHAEL and MIXED NUTS, but even here there's a fair amount
of flab in her film-making.  The peeks into Joe's dysfunctional family,
where all the men keep nabbing trophy wives, only makes the nice guy
normalcy of Hanks-as-Hanks harder to accept, while the supporting cast
(Posey, Kinnear, Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn) is ominpresent without having
much to do.  Much of the first hour of YOU'VE GOT MAIL feels very
inefficient, but fortunately Ephron saves the best for last.  Even as the
film creeps up on the two hour mark, it's unlikely to lose viewer
interest, because that's when Hanks and Ryan shine brightest.  YOU'VE GOT
MAIL is a celebrity-powered wish-fulfillment, and that's okay.  Sometimes
it's enjoyable just watching nice things happen to nice people, even if
the nice people involved happen to be movie stars.

     I suppose if a filmmaker is going to remake a classic film, this
is the right way to do it.  Ernst Lubitsch's SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is
a decent film, but I have never heard of anyone loving it so much that
they could not stand to see other actors in similar roles.  And it was,
in fact, remade as a musical in 1949, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME.
Neither film really developed the idea much beyond being a simple
ironic situation.  Two shop clerks in the same store hate each other
and each loves a pen pal that he/she has never met.  Of course it turns
out they are writing to each other, and somehow it is assumed that the
inner person is represented by the writing and not the actual person.
YOU'VE GOT MAIL takes the same situation and expands on it, using the
anonymity of electronic communications on the Internet.  The film also
looks at the issue of big superstore bookstores chasing out smaller
independent bookstores.  In particular the plot may have inspired by
the incident when a new Barnes and Noble superstore in Manhattan drove
a much-loved children's bookstore, Eeyore Books, out of business.
     Kathleen Kelly (played by Meg Ryan) is the second-generation owner
of The Shop Around the Corner, a children's bookstore in Manhattan that
has become something of a neighborhood institution.  Parents who used
to come to the bookstore as children now bring their children to
discover the world of reading.  But the bookshop is in trouble.  Fox, a
chain of bookstores, is putting a superstore just around the corner
from The Shop Around the Corner.  The competition may well drive the
little bookstore out of business.  But even while her professional life
is in trouble Kathleen is developing an e-mail-based relationship with
a pen pal over the Internet.  The man she knows only as "NY152" is a
decent and witty person.  Little does Kathleen realize that NY152 is
really Tom Fox (Tom Hanks) the third generation owner of the Fox
bookstore chain. In the flesh Tom Fox represents to Kathleen everything
that is going wrong with the book industry.  Small caring bookstores
are being replaced by Goliaths with know-nothing clerks, big comfy
chairs, and cappuccino bars.  Though Kathleen is living with writer
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) and Tom is living with editor Patricia
Eden (Parker Posey), they carry on a secret electronic relationship.
The artificial excitement of the AOL voice saying, "You've got mail!"
becomes almost a metaphor for the loveless by-the-numbers
relationships into which each has fallen.  It is counterpoint to what
they feel writing to each other, flirting with the idea of meeting, but
afraid to dispel the magic.  In fact, much of the best writing of the
film is in the little essays that each sends the other.  At times the
discussions are reminiscent of those in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD.
     This is the third screen teaming of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  The
first time they were together was in JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO, a film so
offbeat that it never found an audience.  (By the way, if you get a
chance, rent this film.  The writing is occasionally lame but more
frequently wonderful.)  Their second romantic teaming was, of course,
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, a film not up to its reputation, but still a gem.
There certainly is chemistry between Hanks and Ryan as strong as
Gable's and Lombard's.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a light and tasty little
romantic recipe for the holidays.  Still, it is the most thoughtful of
the three film versions of this particular story.  I rate it a 7 on the
0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) isn't a bad guy -- he's just a rich guy. He, along
with his father (Dabney Coleman), owns one of the more successful
bookstore chains in New York, Fox Books. He knows that business isn't
personal, and that he isn't intentionally putting all of the independent
bookstores out of business. Nonetheless, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) feels
the effects of Fox Books directly  she owns The Store Around the
Corner, which specializes in children's books and has been in business
for forty-two years. Kathleen takes it personally, and she hates Joe
Fox.
What Kathleen and Joe don't know is that they're having an on-line
e-mail affair with one another. Because they've made a pact to not
divulge personal information through the internet, they have no idea of
each other's true identity. They both feel guilty about pseudo-cheating
on their spouses; Joe's editor girlfriend, Patricia (a wonderful Parker
Posey) is a shallow beast, while Kathleen's relationship with journalist
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) lacks passion. And so begins a surprisingly
funny and touching situational comedy that relies almost completely on
the cuteness factor.
You've Got Mail couldn't have been more perfectly timed. Here we have a
movie about the internet, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and directed
by Nora Ephron. It's a money-making machine, guaranteed to rake in
hundreds of millions of dollars. It doesn't bother me that it's a film
built to make money, because it's been built the right way: You've Got
Mail features a bright, thoughtful script, but it also features two
immensely appealing actors playing people that we wouldn't mind knowing
in real life. 
Oh sure, it's gooey and sentimental. There's no doubt that the people
involved really wanted to make us cry. What makes You've Got Mail
different from the typical tear-jerker, aside from being made with a lot
of skill, is that I almost felt inclined to get all teary-eyed at the
end. I really had to fight it off. Any movie that forces me to fight off
tears is worth something.
What You've Got Mail comes down to is how much we love Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan. Both performers are great at what they do: they've both proven
themselves in numerous dramatic and comedic performances. You've Got
Mail requires a little of everything; Hanks has the difficult role of
making Joe Fox likable, even though he seems at first to be a rich
sadist. Ryan, who is literally too cute for words (and too cute for sex
appeal, I'm afraid) is very funny, and even manages to do a little bit
of acting. Some of the best scenes occur when Joe and Kathleen hate each
other  their first encounter at a caviar party is perfectly timed. 
Of course, there's a lot more to like about the movie, not the least of
which is the spectacular supporting cast. Posey is so perfect as Joe's
superficial girlfriend (although it's surprising to see her in a
mainstream film). Kinnear is convincing and engaging, although he's been
stuck with the role of the boyfriend who gets blown off (the plot device
introduced to keep him from seeming like a loser isn't very effective).
Coleman has some good scenes as Joe's thoughtless father. And Ephron
ties everything together with a nice script and some great romantic
comedy pacing.
What I really liked about You've Got Mail is that it doesn't feel like
an obligatory blockbuster. It has an emotional center and realistic
characters to care about. Joe, for instance, is a troubled man, and
Hanks adds a dimension to the character that might not have been present
in the hands of a lesser actor. In fact, I'm surprised with how much I
liked this movie  it's a perfect family Christmas release, because it
does its job with class and style. And even though you may feel like
you've been dunked in syrup by the end, this particular kind of syrup
tastes pretty good.

"You've Got Mail" is the very definition of a "cute" movie.  It's got cute
stars, a cute story-line, and even cute pets.  Despite this over-whelming
cuteness (or maybe because of it), I loved "You've Got Mail".
I know, I know.  I'm supposed to be a film critic.  I'm not supposed to
love transparent and formula pictures like this.  But darn it, somewhere
along the way, "You've Got Mail" reeled me in, hook, line, and sinker.
The movie stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as two somewhat unhappy New Yorkers
who meet in an AOL online chat room and quickly become close friends,
without ever knowing each others identity.  As the movie progresses,
though, they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each
other.  Meanwhile, in "real-life", they are bitter competitors.  She owns
a quaint little children's bookstore, he owns one of those gigantic
super-bookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices.  While
his store threatens to run her store out of business, their online
relationship grows stronger.
"You've Got Mail" is as artificial as movies come.  Everything is nice and
happy and by the end, all the characters have gotten exactly what they
wanted out of life.  There are no real conflicts, no major
disappointments, no unresolved issues.  Nevertheless, I quite enjoyed it. 
In fact, I can't remember the last time I had such a good time at the
movies. 
I think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn
into it.  The fact that stars Hank and Ryan are at the top of their game
does not hurt either.  In particular, Hanks is at his best here, turning
his "charm-meter" up to 11.  Everytime he was on screen, he had my full
attention.  And despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out
of business, I was rooting for him.  It was good to see Hanks back doing
what he does best:  Playing the affable everyman.
"You've Got Mail" certainly won't be winning any awards, but as an
exercise in pure entertainment, it's as good as it gets.

 You've Got Mail is a timely romance for this impersonal, computer-driven
decade.
 Two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without
revealing their true identities.
 Nora Ephron's contemporary update of The Shop Around the Corner retains
the basic plot: Two people who despise each other unwittingly become
enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence.
 Ephron, who co-wrote the film with her sister, Delia, as well as directed
it, knew what she was doing by reteaming Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as the
at-odds couple.
 Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, owner of a small children's bookstore, while Hanks
is Joe Fox, who heads up a chain of mega bookstores (think Barnes & Noble).
 Their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film, even through
some of the script's rough spots.
 For the Ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they
give short shrift to the talented supporting cast, including Parker Posey,
Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn.
 Yet no one is really going to complain because the Ephrons know their
audience - and what the paying public wants is Hanks and Ryan.
 And the two are kept busy. One, the other or both are in nearly every scene.
 Hanks has his decent guy routine down pat, yet each time he does it, it
seems effortless, spontaneous and fresh.
 Ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable, with a sexy touch of
winsomeness added to the brew.
 Their scenes together sparkle, even though they lack the nostalgic
romanticism of Sleepless in Seattle.
 And the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over You've Got Mail like
dried-up mistletoe. The sparks created by the earlier movie are, by
necessity, not evident here. True, these are two people seeking true love,
but You've Got Mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor.
 The Ephrons' script is witty and sharp. However, as a director Nora Ephron
is a bit uneven. Some scenes drag, while others, especially when Hanks and
Ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail, are crisp and tidy.
 Also, the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely
disappearing from the story.
 A nice, romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special.
 Overall, You've Got Mail is a lush and cute outing, taking advantage of
the star appeal of its two leads.
 It's a nice holiday movie, one for holding hands and snuggling.

Synopsis:
Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) email each other under
assumed names despite each being attached to a different, significant
other. Online Kathleen and Joe get along fabulously. Little do they know
that in real life they are hated rivals, since Kathleen owns a small
bookstore which is being run out of business by a large book chain owned
by Joe. When Joe finds out Kathleen's real life identity, he tries to
slowly woo her. Will they fall in love?
Opinion:
The film begins and ends with likable screen idols Meg Ryan and Tom
Hanks. In a good comedic touch, each deceives their lover in order to
sneak over to the computer and chat with each other. They are adorable
characters, and we immediately sympathize and want them to get together.
But something's not right; their partners seem cardboard and lacking in
human dimensions. After the movie progresses through countless facial
close-up shots and a false ending or two, we realize what is missing:
the joyous comedic element which YOU'VE GOT MAIL began with. In its
place is a plot similar to a 90s therapy session: Tom finds out Meg's
identity, and tries to slowly get her accustomed to the idea of him as a
romantic partner.
Bottom line? While friends might say, "been there, seen that," YOU'VE
GOT MAIL would still be a good selection for the "date" crowd or Tom
Hanks fans.

Rating: 80 %
Starring: Tom Hanks   Meg Ryan   Greg Kinnear
Director: Nora Ephron
Based on 1940's 'Shop around the Corner' and a 1949 musical version 'In the
good old Summertime', this film has got all the elements freshened up for
the 1990's. Nora Ephron conjured up a reunion for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
since their 1993 sleeper hit 'Sleepless in Seattle'.
Set in the Big Apple, the story tells of two individuals Joe Fox (Hanks) and
Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) who get along famously chatting on the internet. They
literally sneak around their partners e-mailing each other, having a
cyberspace romance. Joe's cyber name is 'NY152' and Kathleen is known as
'Shopgirl'. Joe is a rich man, who is busy opening up a huge bookstore,
Kathleen also has a thriving children book shop that was a family business
for decades. Joe's huge discount store is sure to close Kathleen's store.
Joe is the first to find out that 'Shopgirl' is actually Kathleen, and he
uses this information to manipulate Kathleen. Kathleen is heartbroken that
her family business is going down the tubes, and confesses everything to
'NY152'. He even gives her 'Godfatherly' advice as to fight for her rights
to survive. When Kathleen actually finds out that Joe is behind the big
store opening she despises him at first for what he is taking away from her.
She has no security and everything she knew her whole life is gone. Joe
feels terrible about this and tries to win her trust and confidence, but he
also falls for the person he came to know as 'Shopgirl'.
The movie has a lot of charm and should appeal to even the male audiences.
It is a sweet romantic comedy that has two great leading actors. They know
what to do with the movie and they execute their task with warmth and
confidence. Tom Hanks is really a great actor. He can do both drama and
comedy with such ease. Meg Ryan is perfect in this role. I can understand
now why she received a Golden Globe nomination for her part. She was much
better in this fairy tale, than in 'City of Angels'.The chemistry between
Ryan and Hanks was definitely there. Greg Kinnear we all came to know last
year as the gay artist in 'As good as it gets' has a minor role in this
movie. I think he is actually the only weak point of this movie. They could
have done without his role.
Nora Ephron has taken over from Penny Marshall as the best female director
in Hollywood. She was also responsible for the so-so 'Michael' not to long
ago. She brings forth her ideas with such a clear vision. The emotions and
feel of the movie was spot on.The dialogue is funny and witty. The scene
where Hanks introduce his family to Ryan in the bookstore was really funny.
This is one of the best Valentine's Day movies around, waaayyy better than
'Sleepless in Seattle'. Another thing is, we always get to see the gloomy
dark look of New York, not here though. The place is bright and summery. I
felt like moving there straight away.
If your two favourite pasttimes is reading books and the internet, you will
surely love this movie. After seeing so many violent and disaster movies, it
was a nice change of pace. A movie that has warmth and great actors in it. I
can understand why it is such a huge hit currently in the US. Like Ryan's
character said in the movie, it is great to hear those three words, 'You've
got Mail'. I must agree, it is great getting e-mail!!
