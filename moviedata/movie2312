   Based on historical events surrounding Amanda America
Dickson, a bi-racial woman who is the daughter of a wealthy plantation
owner (Sam Waterson) and his slave (Lisagay Hamilton), "A House
Divided" is an adult drama of secrets, lies, and deception. Born with
fair skin, Amanda ("Flashdance" Jennifer Beals) has been raised and
educated near Sparta in ante-bellum Georgia as if she were
white. Under the watchful eye of her grandmother (Shirley Douglas) and
convinced that her mother died during childbirth, she grows up in
privileged circumstances. But when her devoted father dies and leaves
his estate to Amanda, her uncle contests the Will, convinced that she
is not legally entitled to this inheritance. The young lawyer (Tim
Daly) who drew up the document pursues the case in court. During the
trial, through the use of flashbacks, Amanda understands her mother's
sacrifice, comes to terms with their relationship, and finds her true
identity. Directed by John Kent Harrison, Amanda's story was inspired
by the book, "Woman of Color, Daughter of Privilege," written by Kent
Anderson Leslie for a Ph.D. dissertation and adapted for the screen by
Paris Qualles. Viewed from the vantage point of the 21st century,
what's most fascinating is the bizarre psychological climate that
existed in the South between white and black families who were living
side-by-side, often in intimate circumstances, as in this case. The
production values are first-class, as viewed through the sepia-colored
prism of designer Susan Longmire and costumer Resa McConaghy. On the
Granger Made-for-TV Movie Gauge, "A House Divided" is a slow-paced but
hopeful 6, particularly appealing to those who have been estranged
from their parents for any reason. It's on Showtime TV, Sunday, July
30, at 8 P.M.
