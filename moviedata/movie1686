Academy Award-winning director Régis Wargnier (Indochine, A French
Woman, Lumiere and Company) returns to the Oscar-caliber arena with this
multilingual period drama about a family lured back to Stalinist Russia
under a false promise of amnesty. Wargnier's nomination for East-West is
certainly deserved.
Russian emigrants Alexei (Oleg Menchikov-Barber of Siberia, The Kiss)
and Marie Golovine (Sandrine Bonnaire-Circle of Passion, Les Innocents)
receive a disappointing welcome when they step off the boat in Odessa
with their young son, Serioja (played by Ruben Tapiero and Erwan
Baynaud). But, because of Alexei's medical skills, the family is spared
execution and shipped off to Kiev to share meager quarters with a
household of alcoholic miscreants-including a strapping young swimmer
named Sacha (Serguei Bodrov, Jr.) Wracked with guilt over the
miscalculation that has landed his family in captivity, Alexei struggles
to protect his foreign-born wife while avoiding the scrutiny of a
fear-ridden polity. Hope stirs when French actress Gabrielle Develay
(Catherine Deneuve-Indochine, The Hunger, The Last Metro, Belle de Jour)
comes to perform in the local theater.
Tensions plague the Golovine family, from within as well as without.
Alexei, estranged from his wife, begins an affair with their building
superintendent, Olga (Tatiana Doguileva) and Marie turns to the young
Sacha for solace. There's nothing sexy here, however. Just lonely,
desperate people clinging to each other in the dark.
This film is beautifully constructed, with enough emotionally potent
material to keep you in your seat, even if you've had to pee since
curtain. Bonnaire is devastating in her desperation and Oleg Menchikov's
stony-faced coldness is wonderfully unnerving. Catherine Deneuve's
performance as Gabrielle is a smoldering delight, though she only
appears on screen a few times during the film. Despite some appallingly
flat portrayals of Soviet officials that harken back to bad Cold War
stereotypes, the movement of this film is upsetting and delivering;
worthy of the Oscar nomination, if not the Oscar itself.

EAST-WEST (France-Russia, 1999) *** Directed by Regis Wargnier. 
Written by Wargnier, Roustan Ibraguimbek, Sergei Bodrov, Louis 
Gardel. Photography, Laurent Dailland. Editing, Herve Schneid. 
Production design, Vladimir Svetozarov, Alexei Levtchenko. Music, 
Patrick Doyle. Cast: Sandrine Bonnaire (Marie), Oleg Menchikov 
(Alexei Golovin), Catherine Deneuve (Gabrielle), Sergei Bodrov, Jr. 
(Sacha), Ruben Tapiero (Serioja at 7), Erwan Baynaud (Serioja at 14), 
Grigoru Manoukiv, Tatiana Doguileva, Bogdan Stupka, Meglena 
Massalitinova, Valentine Gavev, Nikilai Binev, Rene Feret, et al. A 
Sony Classics release. In French (and some Russian) with subtitles. 
121 minutes. PG-13. At the New Art Theatre.
World War II ended in 1945. A year later, in June 1946, the Soviet 
dictator Josef Stalin started a barrage of propaganda in the West, 
especially western Europe where there were many thousands of Russian 
émigrés. Stalin promised milk and honey, or more specifically, 
amnesty, a Russian passport, a warm welcome to the Soviet Union which 
the returnees would help reconstruct after its destructions during 
the Hitler War, and in fact make it even better a Workers' Paradise 
than it used to be.  Russians seem to be more sentimental and 
nostalgic for their country than other people. So a lot of the 
émigrés took the bait --and lived (sometimes very briefly) to regret 
it.
Among them was Alexei Golovin a young doctor from Paris, his young 
French wife Marie, and their 7-year French-born son Serioja.
No sooner had the ship reached Odessa, even before all the passengers 
were on terra firms, the Golovin couple and many others realized what 
a mistake their return was. The majority of returnees get jailed, 
executed or are sent to gulags. The Golovins are spared because the 
Soviets need doctors.
The family is sent to Kiev, in a horrible "kommunalka" apartment 
where at best one gets just room per family, shares facilities (an 
euphemism--we see a man coming out of the toilet carrying his own 
wooden seat!), have no peace, no privacy, and be subjected to 
miseries by others. The people are also always spied upon, informed 
on, betrayed. It's not a wonderful life.
Very, very soon Marie wants to return to France -- and she would be 
stupid if she did not--but in the Soviet Union, what's done cannot be 
undone. Stalinist paranoia and mass madness rule, no one is safe, not 
even in his or her thoughts, not to mention that the least act or 
action can and will result in catastrophes.
Alexei agrees with his wife, but being more realistic (as well as of 
Russian extraction) he advises patience --which will lead a split in 
the couple. It's all very believable and very well documented and 
shown. A third, important character, depending on your set of mind, 
may or may not be considered a melodramatic addition. He is Sacha, 
the teen-ager and star swimmer (played by the son of one of the 
film's writers) who, under circumstances that I find not at all hard 
to believe, enters into a special relationship with Marie and later 
becomes part of her scheme to be taken back to France. The latter is 
a thread (a fat one too) that runs throughout the plot as it deals 
with the failed efforts of the woman (partly because her French 
passport was torn up by the Soviets) to contact French authorities in 
Russia.
There is a great more in incidents, events, surprises, suspense and 
criticism of Stalinist Russia. The movie was filmed in Russia for the 
most part, and has an undeniable  visual authenticity. It is, of 
course, manicheistic, with white hats vs black hats, but there is 
really no way to maintain half-tones and subtleties in situations 
which, in real life, were black and white with little in-between.
Political films are becoming rare and more's the pity. Wargnier 
(pronounced Var-NYEH) had earlier won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for 
his also political "Indochine."
I hope he stays on the track of history and politics, which teaches 
audiences a great deal more than space travel fiction.

  Oscar-nominated as best foreign film, France's "East-West"
begins in 1946, when Stalin launched a propaganda campaign aimed at
Russian emigrants living in the West, offering amnesty and a chance to
participate in the post-war reconstruction of the USSR. So an
idealistic physician (Oleg Menchikov), his French wife (Sandrine
Bonnaire), and their young son return to his homeland with high hopes
of a bright future. But as soon as they land in Odessa, they discover
they've been duped. The zealous military is convinced that 90% of the
expatriates are "imperialist spies" and, as such, are subject to
constant supervision and brutal interrogation. The doctor and his
family are assigned to a tiny apartment in a dilapidated building
which houses five other families who share a communal bathroom and
whatever black-market goods they can steal. "They can't force us to
stay," the wife reasons. But her husband knows otherwise, begging,
"Forgive me."  While he works within the system, trying to secure his
family's release, she becomes involved with a passionate, 17 year-old
competitive swimmer (Serguei Bodrov Jr.) who is just as eager to
escape as she is. Then a visiting French actress, Catherine Deneuve,
offers the victims a glimmer of hope. Writer/director Regis Wargnier
("Indochine") captures the dismal dreariness of social repression and
political enslavement but fails to create compelling,
three-dimensional characters. For example, after two years in a Soviet
labor camp, Sandrine Bonnaire emerges looking exquisite - with
perfectly manicured fingernails - and the escape "attempt" at night in
a wintry sea is so far-fetched that it strains credulity.  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "East-West" is a bleak, flimsy 5. It's
too slick and simplistic to be truly engaging entertainment.

Directed by Regis Wargnier. Screenplay by Sergei Bodrov, Louis Gardel,
Rustam Ibragimbekov and Wargnier. Starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg
Menshikov, Catherine Deneuve. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is
not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 30th, 2000.
It's somewhat ironic that I saw "East-West" the evening after viewing Rod
Lurie's "The Contender". Both are politically charged movies which,
although laudable in broad strokes, fail to achieve their full potential
because they adopt an overtly simplistic approach to their subject 
matter. For "The Contender", it was a matter of dismissing potent dramatic
issues in favour of an easy, quick-fix resolution designed to make the
audience go home happy. In the case "East-West", the problem is somewhat
more ingrained.
Featuring French and Russian dialogue (with English subtitles), 
"East-West" is the decade-spanning story of Frenchwoman Marie Golovin
(Sandrine Bonnaire), whose husband Alexei (Oleg Menchikov) is one of
thousands of Russians being wooed back to their homeland in the aftermath
of World War II. The film, directed by Regis Wargnier, starts
beautifully as we watch the homeward-bound Russians celebrating in a 
sumptuous ship's cabin. Then, without warning, we are deposited into the
terrifying midst of the Soviet empire: as the passengers disembark, they
are immediately herded into two groups, depending on whether or not the
Kremlin believes them to be "imperialist spies".
Marie is initially amongst the condemned, and survives only because of the
pleas of her husband, a renowned doctor. They are sent to live in a
crowded residence housing several other families. Alexei becomes the head
of medicine at a factory while Marie does the laundry for a military
choir. They are constantly watched, though, and when the residence's
supervisor makes the mistake of revealing to Marie that she knows French,
she is soon relieved of her duties and taken away. The woman's grandson
Sacha (Sergei Bodrov Jr), now homeless, is taken in by the Golovins. 
Marie, disillusioned with her husband's apparent unwillingness to stand up
to the state, begins a passionate affair with Sacha. Together, they plot
to escape Russia by taking advantage of Sacha's position as a member of
the Soviet swim team.
"East-West" is a visual treat, as Wargnier fills the screen with contrasts
that are, naturally enough, both entrancing and horrifying. The stark
beauty of the Russian landscape is set tantalisingly against the sheer
brutality of the Communist regime. (The snowswept image of the pond where
Sacha trains, now frozen over with ice, is particularly memorable.) Scenes
of romance and tenderness are tempered by the knowledge that everyone is
being watched and nobody can be trusted. Even Sacha's triumph in
qualifying for the national swim team is offset by the fact that it has
been engineered for darker, more desperate purposes -- and the powers that
be may or may not be aware of the fact.
But unfortunately, Wargnier fails to conjure a story compelling enough to
live up to his stirring images. "East-West" is far too conventional in its
structure, dwelling not on the oppression of the Supreme Soviet but
instead on Marie's efforts to escape the country. It is the Cold War
reduced to its most simplistic form -- Communism is bad, democracy is
good, and shades of grey are all but nonexistent. "East-West" would have
been better served if Wargnier had opted to more strongly establish the
effect of the political climate on everyday Russian life. Instead, he
concentrates mostly on the more extreme aspects of the regime, such as a
Gestapo agent who is almost cartoonish in his villainy.
The result is that Wargnier loses touch with his characters. "East-West" 
is a movie that looks like a very personal drama, but is executed more
like a particularly slow-moving Tom Clancy thriller. None of the leads
enjoy much depth, and Menchikov is particularly ill-served by the flimsy,
tepid Alexei. Both Bonnaire and Bodrov bring a lot of vitality to their
roles, but have little personality. They are thinly-veiled stereotypes; 
Marie is the Westerner trapped behind the Iron Curtain, Sacha the
Easterner rebelling against his Communist masters.
Wargnier never effectively conveys the ties between the characters. Marie
and Alexei feel less like husband and wife than casual acquaintances. When
their marriage begins to break down and both begin affairs with other
people, it is an almost casual occurrence. "East-West" feels populated by
shadows, gliding through events without every truly becoming involved in
them. There is no resonance to the drama being played out.
Even Catherine Deneuve, portraying a French stage actress named Gabrielle
who may be Marie's most important ally, seems to be struggling to lend
substance to her character. To make matters worse, Deneuve brings such
presence to the film that she dominates any scene in which she appears; 
Bonnaire and the others simply cannot compete. This would be fine if
Gabrielle played a more central role in "East-West", but she does not; she
is a facilitator, whose emotional stakes in the drama are limited at best.
Ultimately, then, "East-West" is a lovely but disaffecting drama which
settles for simplicity when it should be striving for depth. Lacking the
complexity of characterisation and depiction needed to effectively explore
the themes it proffers, "East-West" ends up being little more than a
pretty (and chilling) pictorial of the Soviet Union in the middle part of
this century. This, in of itself, is not altogether without merit.
"East-West", however, could have been much more.
