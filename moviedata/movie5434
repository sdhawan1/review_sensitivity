Subtitled
     ABEL is that standard staple of films everywhere, the family farce.  Here
we have a penthouse apartment inhabited by Abel, a 31-year-old eccentric who
has never left the house, and likes to try to kill flies with scissors; and his
parents, a Valkyrie-like mother, Dove, who indulges her son's behavior, and the
strict, parochial father, Victor, who attempts to have them all lead a "normal
life"--though his definition of normal is not particularly wide-spread (thank
goodness!).  The film opens with the growing friction between Abel and Victor,
and the rather bizarre actions of Dove, and how it drives Victor out to find a
mistress, Sis.  As Dove and Abel become stranger and stranger, Victor be- comes
more and more frustrated, until, one night, he throws Abel out of the house...
and, by coincidence (this is a farce, after all), into the arms of Sis.
     Mildly entertaining, with a few pretty funny parts, but don't go out of
your way to see it.  A D+, $1.50 film.
