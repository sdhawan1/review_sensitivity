     A MIDNIGHT CLEAR is a World War II story on the insanity and stupidity
of war in general told with bitter humor and irony.  It begs comparison with
CASTLE KEEP and especially CATCH-22  It pretty well had to be an angry film,
being directed by Keith Gordon (who had previously made THE CHOCOLATE WAR),
and being based on a novel by William Wharton (the author of the book
BIRDY).  And there is a lot of rage let out in A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, sometimes
eloquently, sometimes muddled.
     The story is set in mid-December, 1944, in the Ardennes Forest.
Somewhere, in another part of the forest, the Battle of the Bulge--the last
great German offensive of the war--is raging.  (Curiously, they never
mention that this is the Battle of the Bulge, even in the narration.  It
might have helped some viewers place the action in perspective.)  The story
concerns a squad of six very war-weary Americans sent to act as sentinels
where the Germans are expected to break through.  Basically they are to
report, then save themselves if they can.  It does not help their odds that
one of their number is already nearly insane.  No reasonable commander would
give such an order, but their Major Griffin (played by John McGinley) is
every soldier's worst nightmare--stupid, officious, and without a touch of
sympathy for the men he commands.
     Then things start getting stranger for the squad.  They find the
corpses of a German and an American soldier frozen in a tableau of dancing
together.  They have several encounters with Germans that should have gotten
them killed and the Germans refuse to throw anything at them worse than
snowballs.  In fact, they have run into a squad of Germans who apparently
wants to play one of the most dangerous games of wartime--they seem to want
to make a separate peace.
     This is a slow, deliberate, and very introspective film--an odd choice
to start the summer fluff season.  It reaches its climax a good half-hour
before the end of the film and then just sort of smolders out.  There are
many bizarre touches in the photography, not the least of which is the
bizarre statuary in the area the squad is trying to secure.  One statue
holds its decapitated head in front of it like a ghost.  Mark Isham's score
depicts the weirdness of the situation, but certainly not the period.  The
film is sad, angry, and anti-war straight through.  Even the flashback sex
scene turns out to be sad, angry, and anti-war.  The film is much more
anxious to attain a literary style than to be an accurate portrayal of how
war is fought, but it makes its point.  I give it a low +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.

A MIDNIGHT CLEAR (1992) *** 1/2. Directed and written by Keith Gordon
from a novel by William Wharton. Photography, Tom Richmond. Production
design, David Nichols. Editing, Don Brochu. Music, Mark Isham.  Cast:
Peter Berg, Kevin Dillon, Arye Gross, Ethan Hawke, Gary Sinise, Frank
Whaley, John C. McGinley. An Interstar Release. 107 minutes. Rated R
(wartime violence,  strong language).
Television these days is invaded by older movies about W.W.II. In 1992
it was as if the small screen did not celebrate 1492 but 1942, with
older viewers in mind. Yet Hollywood's annual production stream of war
movies in the 40's and 50's--stressing patriotism and exciting
action--became a trickle in recent decades .
In a non-conformist move, the producers of 'A Midnight Clear' had the
courage to make a non-commercial war film at a time when the genre was
not popular among the masses, and a film whose anti-war message, unlike
the premise of most Second World War pictures, is that even the
'cleanest' conflict in US. history, W.W.II, was not a Good War. 
In style and substance the picture is halfway between the disillusioned
, pacifist movies about W.W. I ("All Quiet on the Western Front," "The
Man I Killed," "Grand Illusion," "Paths of Glory") and the few
revisionist movies about W.W.II, mostly adaptations of sarcastic novels
("Catch-22," "Slaughterhouse Five") that underscored the surreal
dementia of armed conflict.
"A Midnight Clear" comes from a semi-autobiographical novel, and it
convinces. It was made with a young cast and by a then-30 year old actor
directing his second movie. His first was "The Chocolate War" (1988),
about a power struggle in a Catholic boys' school. 
The setting is the Ardennes Forest--Park City, Utah, doubles nicely-- a
snowy no-man's land that could be France, Germany, Belgium or
Luxembourg. The time is December 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge,
Germany's last but devastating counter-attack .
An Infantry and Reconnaissance squad of G.I.s is ordered by martinet
Major Griffin (McGinley) to hole up in an deserted chateau (actually a
fancy country house) and report on enemy movements. The soldiers had
been trained for I & R because of their high I.Q.s--which automatically
make of them skeptical warriors. From twelve the squad has dwindled to
six.You take for granted that the "Ten Little Indians" syndrome will
continue.
In the woods, the Yanks encounter a group of those last-ditch draftees
(too old or too young) that the Third Reich called up for its desperate
"Totalkrieg" (Total War).The Germans make with the "Amis" a deal that's
unusual and will have unexpected consequences. But then strangeness is
more rule than exception in wartime. 
The squad is led by its junior,William Knott (Hawke). His name had been
abbreviated to Will Not, then to Won't, but typically the film does not
milk this for effect. Knott is puzzled and not especially pleased at
having been made sergeant.He is the film's narrator and speaks
matter-of-factly about his comrades and the absurdities and atrocities
of war. We're close to Kurt Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim territory.
The group includes John Lennon-ish "Mother" Wilkins played by the
co-founder of Chicago's famed Steppenwolf Theater, stage actor, then
filmmaker Gary Sinise. Here he is called "Mother" because at 26 he is
the oldest, married and fussy about neatness. He is going crazy fast and
his companions try to protect him."Father" Mundy (Whaley), is a seminary
dropout who has made the men promise to keep their language clean. The
others are called Bud Miller (a beerish Anglo name), Mel Avakian
(Armenian), and Stan Schutzer (Jewish) 
This, however, is not the old movies' motley group of G.I.s, (or the
Dirty Half-Dozen), with the machine-stamped dosage of religions,
ethnicities,professions, voices (one Brooklyn  accent per movie was de
rigueur), or the sameness of their post-war dreams which invariably
featured "dames" and "big, juicy steaks."
In "A Midnight Clear," neither the I.Q.s, nor the men's backgrounds,
physical characteristics, temperaments, skills, differences or
idiosyncrasies are highlighted. Partly on purpose and mostly, I think,
by serendipity, there is about the soldiers a general vagueness that
borders on impersonality, as if the mad tragedy of war made customary
distinctions futile. 
Some bits of religious symbolism seem unnecessary, as does a flashback
of four of the boys losing their virginity, serially and in one night,
to the distraught fiancee of a killed soldier. That's a most unhygienic
sequence. Otherwise though, the film plays down melodrama and
sentimentality, has a clever but not smartie-pants script and does not
push its points.It even keeps a rein on the character of despicable
Major Griffin, clearly suggesting that for the squad it is this fatuous
commander who is the real enemy, not the Krauts. 
The movie had an excellent critical reception, but given its seriousness
and the lack of a promotional campaign it soon returned to the
orphanage.
