Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore star in this formula monster flick set
in a museum. Miller stars as a museum curator in the insect department.
Sizemore as a Chicago homicide cop. One of Miller's colleagues has sent an
artifact back to the museum from Africa. He has packed it in palm leaves,
which just happened to be infested with something. On the way back to
Chicago by freighter, that something begins to get a bit bigger and mutate.
It eventually kills everyone on board the ship. When it finally arrives in
Chicago, the killer creature moves into the museum. Which, conveniently
enough, has a large, dark labyrinth of chambers and tunnels. Just the place
for a killer mutated whatever to hide, and that much more difficult for the
police to track it down. Of course, the cops don't know they are on the
trail of a giant killer monster, they think that the deaths on the ship are
the result of a serial killer. Add to that the fact that the museum is just
days away from hosting a big fundraiser that will inevitably lead to a
veritable smorgasbord of human entrees for this big ugly monster.
The whole cast is just going through the motions on this one. They seem to
instinctively know that this isn't a great movie, but rather a pretty
formula one at best. Not even the amazingly talented Linda Hunt
distinguishes herself in this one.
The Relic does have its share of scary moments. Most of the scares come from
the search for the monster in the tunnels under the museum. I'll have to
give the writers credit for setting this film in an old museum, since the
nooks and crannies can make for pretty frightening terrain. The rest of the
writing is pretty much your typical horror film stuff. With the characters
doing the exact opposite of what normal people would do in this situation.
Most people, when they thought that a killer was on the loose in a museum,
would stay they heck away from it. Not these geniuses. They are all
hell-bent on throwing a mighty shindig.
The creature's special effects are nothing special either. It's nothing that
we all haven't seen a dozen times before in monster movies. The Relic is
your average monster movie. Nothing about it distinguishes it from the rest
of the pack. It probably will satisfy some fans of this genre, but most will
be left pretty underwhelmed.

What is with the horror/thriller genre of today?   Either we have
movies that try to spoof horror (i.e. "Scream") with moderately
enjoyable results, or the countless number of movies that actually try
to freak us out, with for the most part, far too predictable and almost
laughable results.  "The Relic" throws us an interesting plot and pretty
sweet special effects - big potential.   However, by the end of the
movie, all the glory that "The Relic" tries to achieve nose dives.
The plot of "The Relic" (contrary to all the scientific mumbo jumbo you
hear throughout the movie) is rather simple:  A mutated monster that
kills humans to stay alive has been accidentally sent to the Field
Museum in Chicago with disastrous results.   An attractive evolutionary
biologist (Penelope Ann Miller) and a veteran homicide cop (Tom
Sizemore) both work apart, then together to stop and destroy this
monster.   The plot actually stays intact pretty well for a horror
flick, and I enjoyed it, it was quite original.   To boot, the
"scariness" of the movie starts slow and picks up speed gradually, with
satisfying results.   In addition, a few of the "nail biting" hooks work
relatively well, and the cinematography does these sparse scenes
justice.
Unfortunately, about halfway through the movie when the tension really
heats up, the movie tanks.   First problem: the acting.   Penelope Ann
Miller turns suddenly from a good role as bad boy biologist into yet
another stereotyped "woman-victim", meaning she spends the rest of the
movie screaming and running in high heels and a tight black dress.   The
other star, Tom Sizemore hits rock bottom too.   Sizemore starts as the
hard-boiled cop he seems to play well in many movies (i.e. "True
Romance") but soon goes WAY over the top, reduced to doing little but
barking orders and using the "f" word a lot.   Second problem: the
people in the movie are just too stupid.   Naturally, when all hell
breaks loose nobody except Ann Miller and Sizemore have any strategy,
the people just run around and become puppy chow for the monster.  Even
the two stars don't exactly have a winning formula: Instead of just
trying to escape right away from the museum, they decide that "this
f**king thing has to be DESTROYED first" and spend much of the movie
trying to find the origin of this monster.   It all seemed quite trivial
to me, just a pretty lame plot excuse to have some more "near-miss"
thriller scenes.   Last problem:  The ending. After what seemed to be a
very confusing and overblown "special effects extravaganza" final
showdown, in what seems a matter of seconds the entire movie wraps
itself up far too quickly.
In the end, "The Relic" seemed like a horror/thriller movie almost
ready to crack out of its shell, but unfortunately became another
heavily flawed flick that dies half way out of the starting gate.

CAPSULE: Claustrophobic, flashy-looking and occasionally neat thriller about
a... monster?... that gets loose in a museum. Good for audiences that talk
back.
Tom Sizemore is turning into one of my favorite actors to look forward to.
He's been watchable and interesting in everything I've seen him in so far,
and that includes THE RELIC, a flashy piece of noise about some kinda
critter that consists mostly of teeth making all hell break loose in a
museum. It's either your cup of tea or it isn't; the movie won't win any
converts to the genre, but is decently entertaining, and has all the right
ingredients. It's ALIEN crossbred with fill-in-the-blank, and that's
innovation for you in today's film market.
Sizemore's character, D'Agosta, is a superstitious cop, and that instantly
sets up a cute (albeit manufactured) tension between him and Margo Green
(Penelope Ann Miller). She's an evolutionary biologist who doesn't believe
in the boogeyman, but monsters like the one in this movie have a way of
making people into believers. Actually, she understands how it's been
created -- the science in the story is fast and loose, but what the hell, at
least it's THERE -- but is still scared of it. You would be, too.
The creature actually has an m.o.: it hunts and kills to consume the
hypothalamus of the victim, since the gland in question provides a hormone
that the creature needs to evolve. Or survive. Or something -- I decided it
wasn't important; after all, the gland can only manufacture hormones when
it's in a warm and breathing creature. Ripping it out and eating it would be
only good for a quick fix, apparently, and maybe not even that.
But comments like this are like saying SE7EN was too dark and rainy: they're
beside the point. The movie is about action and movement and shocks, and it
has all of them. It also has some viciously convincing special effects, and
a student of same would do well to check out the movie for no other reason.
But while you're at it, look at Sizemore. He has that look on his face that
shows there's someone at home, even when the script treats him like a piece
of furniture. I walked out wondering when I'd get to see him lead in a movie
where there wasn't something trying to rip open his head and eat it.

     THE RELIC is based on what is apparently a fairly popular horror
novel by Douglas Preston (author of the non-fiction DINOSAURS IN THE
ATTIC, about the American Museum of Natural History) and horror editor
Lincoln Child.  The trailers for the film preceded the release by
several months.  That is all really something of a pity.  This would be
a great little film to come upon by accident, sitting in some dusty
corner of the video store.  Maybe this should be the second film of a
drive-in double-feature, playing with something like MARS ATTACKS!  The
key to enjoying THE RELIC is to see it on the cheap with very little
expectation.  Then you would not feel you have to analyze the ideas in
any great detail.  This film is for the 90s what a film like TARANTULA
was for the 50s, a bit of playful fun with some really dubious science.
THE RELIC pastes together bits from a lot of horror and science fiction
movies and gives some nice hokum explanations for how its particular
monster came to be haunting a natural history museum in Chicago.  If
you look for it you will see the ghost ship from DRACULA or a big chunk
of plot borrowed from THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.  Another piece of the
idea comes from THE CREEPING UNKNOWN.  Still, by STAR TREK standards
the ideas in the film seem mostly reasonably plausible and nothing
seems totally absurd.  The film fails only in that it does not offer
enough to satisfy the expectations for a major studio production.
     A museum expedition to the Amazon Basin in Brazil has discovered
some peculiar superstitions of the local Indians.  They involve a
statue and some other jungle artifacts that get crated up and sent to
the Chicago Museum of Natural History by an explorer who later regrets
sending them.  At the museum the artifacts come to the attention of the
research staff including a young evolutionary biologist Margo Green
(played by Penelope Ann Miller) and her mentor and friend Dr. Frock
(James Whitmore).  But what really attracts attention is the set of
beheadings that start occurring in different parts of the museum.
Investigating them comes Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore).
He is asked to keep a lid on the killings because the museum is about
to open a major new exhibit on superstition that will be extremely
lucrative for the museum.  The museum director (Linda Hunt) is planning
in just a day or two to inaugurate the exhibit with a celebration, a
major social event for the city government of Chicago.  D'Agosta does
not want the opening ceremonies for the exhibit to occur in a museum
with a killer still at large somewhere in the huge system of
underground chambers beneath the museum, but the museum plans to go
ahead.  While D'Agosta tries to find the killer, Dr. Green struggles to
understand exactly what the superhuman killer is.
     Penelope Ann Miller is probably the least interesting of the top-
billed four actors.  Tom Sizemore as the superstitious police detective
is a much more interesting actor.  He overcomes the distraction of his
constant one-day growth of beard to put some interesting accent on his
character.  He is probably remembered best for the sleazy sorts he
played in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS and NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  He plays his
hero in much the same way and it is worth seeing the sleaziness
translate into attitude.  Linda Hunt and James Whitmore are both
magnetic scene stealers, as is a somewhat mournful-looking dog.
Director Peter Hyams's previous science fiction films have been
CAPRICORN ONE, OUTLAND, 2010, and TIMECOP. Of those, only 2010 warrants
even the effort of a second viewing and it was pretty stodgy.  Hyams
had to step over into horror to make his first reasonably enjoyable
science fiction film.  Even in THE RELIC he lacks the style he really
needs.  Hyams floods the film with false-alarm jump scenes, many highly
predictable, instead of creating the feeling of tension he really
needs.
     Perhaps the best thing to do with this film would be to forget you
ever heard of it and then rent it in two years.  Barring that, go into
the theater with lots of popcorn and no expectations.  Then you might
agree this film deserves a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

It is early January and for the most part, those films that were not
expected to be Oscar-nominated because they were so miserable, are now
brought to light.  One such is RELIC, a science-fiction film ridden
with cliches.
There is hardly a well-lit scene in the entire film.  Making dark
scenes and using green ominous lighting to denote fear and terror are,
of course, old tricks of the trade.  Another is sudden LOUD sounds. It
seems that every scene-change was accompanied by a very loud crash that
had nothing to do with the scene on the screen. One noise that is
supposed to scare is a cat knocking something over.  Give me a break.
The film has no science worthy of the name but a good deal of fiction.
"The basic premise," says Douglas Preston, who along with Lincoln Child
wriote the book on which the film is based, "is that a virus can
introduce genetic material into your own DNA which produces a hormone
that can produce dramatic physical changes.
There are many examples in the animal world, such as a tadpole turning
into a frog."  Hardly the same thing.
In the film, there is an animal on a rampage of murder.  Because of the
lighting we barely see the creature until it is on fire and dashes thru
the passageways.  That is the only bit of special effects worth
mentioning.  OTOH, there are other special effects such as Dr. Margo
Green (Penelope Ann Miller) an evolutionary biologist (sure!) who goes
through hell without hardly a hair out of place.  She is even given the
opportunity to wear a tightly-fitting black sheath dress that also
remains almost pristine.  I think one shoulder strap slid a bit off her
shoulder.
When all hell is breaking loose in the Museum, with people running out
into the street and police spurring them on to leave quickly, police
and ambulance sirens shrieking, Dr Green and Dr Frock (defrock?) (James
Whitmore) are in the lab joking and carrying on a friendly conversation
while waiting for the results of something they are testing.  HELP!
Also lending his talents, as Detective Lt. D'Agosta are Tom Sizemore
and Linda Hunt as Dr Cuthbert, the head of the museum.

Cast: Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt, James Whitmore 
Director: Peter Hyams 
Producers: Gale Ann Hurd, Sam Mercer  
Screenplay: Amy Holden Jones and John Raffo and Rick Jaffa & 
      Amanda Silver based on the novel by Douglas Preston and 
      Lincoln Child 
Cinematography: Peter Hyams 
Music: John Debney  
U.S. Distributor: Paramount Pictures 
     There are moments when THE RELIC is almost enjoyable, albeit in a 
visceral sort of way.  Unfortunately, when all is said and done, this 
horror/science fiction amalgamation seems like nothing more ambitious 
than a bad reworking of elements from ALIENS, SPECIES, JAWS, and 
PREDATOR.  Except for the choice of protagonists and the setting, 
there's nothing remotely new here.  Even the homicidal monster, created 
in the workshop of veteran creature master, Stan Winston, looks like the 
result of mixing and matching some of the most gruesome attributes of 
recent non-human villains.  
     Director Peter Hyams (one of the few film makers to act as his own 
cinematographer), who once helmed Sean Connery in OUTLAND, manages to 
occasionally elevate the tension to a level that arrests the audience's 
attention, but it doesn't lead to anything worthwhile.  The ending is a 
classic example of deus ex machina -- a sudden, unexpected turn-of-
events that leaves movie-goers shaking their heads sadly and wondering 
why the screenwriters couldn't have thought up something more reasonable 
and satisfying. 
     Most of the action takes place in Chicago's Museum of Natural 
History, the destination of a mysterious artifact from Brazil.  Shortly 
after its arrival, a security guard is brutally murdered (he's 
decapitated and part of his brain is eaten).  Chicago P.D. Detective 
D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) thinks there's a link between the museum murder 
and a recent massacre on a ship found adrift in Lake Michigan.  As 
D'Agosta's investigation takes him deeper into the bowels of the 
building, he is reluctantly helped by Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann 
Miller), an evolutionary biologist who discovers important DNA evidence 
about the killer. 
     The second half of the movie, which is by far the most energetic, 
involves a gala celebration at the museum that turns into a bloodbath 
when the creature gets loose and starts beheading people and sucking out 
their brains.  A power failure causes all the security doors to crash 
down, trapping a number of dignitaries inside the building.  This 
results in a cat-and-mouse hunt through unlit, underground tunnels and 
water-filled catacombs, with D'Agosta and Green trying to distract the 
monster so that it doesn't devour the mayor. 
     The film is filled with references to DNA, evolution, and all sorts 
of other scientific (or, in some cases, pseudo-scientific) mumbo-jumbo.  
While these may have been important plot aspects of the novel upon which 
THE RELIC is based, all they manage to accomplish here is to add minutes 
to the running time without providing any valuable insight into what's 
going on.  To borrow a term, THE RELIC is basically designed as a "bug 
hunt"; attempts to make it anything more intelligent or interesting 
fail. 
     Penelope Ann Miller definitely isn't classic action heroine 
material.  She looks nice in a slinky black dress and can let out a 
pretty decent scream, but she's too petite to get involved in any face-
to-face combat.  As a result, the always-reliable Tom Sizemore is on 
hand to provide some muscle (although he's shut out of the final battle 
by a conveniently-locked metal door).  I suppose these two deserve 
credit for maintaining such a level of earnestness amidst all the 
cliches. 
     This kind of movie has a built-in audience, although it's not clear 
how large that audience is.  We've seen so many variations on this same 
story that it's gradually losing whatever appeal it once held.  THE 
RELIC isn't the film to inject new life into the sub-genre.  Instead, 
this is just the latest attempt to milk a mostly-dry formula, and the 
result is what you might expect -- a slick, gory motion picture with 
lots of cheap shocks, including the obligatory cat jumping out of the 
darkness.  Such a poor payoff is hardly a good reason to shell out the 
price of admission at the box office.

Director Peter Hyams whose films include 'Hanover Street' (1979) 'The Star
Chamber' (1983) and the protracted sequel to '2001: A Space Odyssey' entitled
'2010: The Year We Make Contact' (1984) and many other films, most of them
mediocre at best has emerged with his latest offering entitled 'The Relic.'
 A museum in Chicago is subjected to being terrorized by a South American
monster that is part insect, part amphibian and part human.  After setting up
the story it then turns into a cheap slasher film with little or no
imagination and is an embarassment to the film industry at large.  An
evolutionary biologist (Penelope Ann Miller) works at solving the origins of
this creepy beast and a homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) is along for the
ride.  The biologist, detective and even the film's portrayal of the mayor
are all stereotypes we've seen over and over again.  I was even further
appalled at the claustrophobic nature of this film which muddles its way down
dark tunnels and long corridors in an attempt to find the chilling effect of
any horror film we've seen before.  After a while the film becomes even more
boring and silly.  It's downright trivial the further and further it goes on.
 Director Hyams acts as his own director of photography like he has in the
past and his liking of lens flare for moody effects is hard on the eyes
before too long.  Academy award winning actress Linda Hunt and veteran actor
James Whitmore round out notable members of the cast and their talents are
way above this turkey of a movie.

Lots of dead bodies, opened skulls and missing hypothalamuses (no not
hippopotamus, but hypothalamus -- the brain stem) by the end of the
movie.
Yes, my heart jumped with every sudden movement and loud noise on
screen, and I had to shield my eyes with my file-o-fax when 'The Relic'
butchered humans; but the grandmothers sitting behind me seemed to
having a grand old time, giggling at every scene. Then it dawned on me
what they were laughing about, this movie was pure, contrived stupidity.
The story is about a relic in a large, old museum and you guessed it,
'The Relic' likes killing people. Lot's of cat and mouse chases, feeding
frenzies, festering fungi, enormous dung beetles and grouchy cops with
missing dogs.

Occasionally, everyone needs to see a movie where they can let it all
down and get a good scare. If you're that kind of person, then I would
recommend seeing director Peter Hyams' new film, The Relic.
This originally frightful film stars Penelope Anne Miller (The Shadow),
as an over-worked and under-credited biologist at a wealthy Chicago
museum and Tom Sizemore, (Devil in a Blue Dress) as an ironically
superstitious police detective. Both performances were filled to their
extents, as there was not much character build-up other than the
recurring "superstitious" ideas.
The Relic may look to be just another Alien-like movie, but to my
surprise, it was much more than that. It contained some wicked plot
twists, especially about the monster itself. When it came to keeping the
audience guessing, no one had a clue of the monsters appearance until
the end of the movie, where it's hideous figure was revealed to all.
It turns out that the monster is actually a genetically-cloned freak,
containing parts from many animals of the African jungles, making the
beast the perfect hunter. The monster had a lion-like appearance,
scorpion-like claws, ant-like tentacles, and lizard-like scales.
Obviously, the special effects were breath-taking, as the creature
looked unbelievably realistic.
The plot is relatively average, like most movies of its caliber. Yet
The Relic throws in some interesting plot twists and slight changes. It
puts a group of rich aristocrats in a Chicago museum for the grand
opening of the brand new "Superstitions" wing. The police warned the
party to cancel, after the brutal murder of a museum security guard,
failing miserably. The people obviously don't know what they're up
against, and they are trapped inside after the beast attacks the
museum's central control room. So it's survival of the fittest in harsh
conditions, pitting the rich folks against the ferocious creature.
The Relic was, again, very original. Director Hyams uses very dark,
shadowy shots mixed with loud, suspenseful music to instill an eerie
feeling of fright into his viewers.
If you have not seen this one yet and you like suspenseful, science
fiction movies, then you would love The Relic..
Grade: B, *** out of *****

The year is barely a week old, and there is already a candidate for
the worst of 1997--The Relic, a would-be chiller that's more successful at
making the audience laugh than scream.
In this ridiculous film from uberhack Peter Hyams (whose last two
pictures were dreadful Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles), a creature that
feeds on the hypothalamuses (hypothalamii?) of humans and animals goes on a
killing spree in a Chicago museum.  How did this creature come into
existence, and why does it feed on hormones?  The "scientific" explanation
cooked up by the four--yes, four--credited screenwriters (Amy Holden Jones,
John Raffo, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver) takes "suspension of disbelief"
to new heights, even by monster movie standards.  But as cockamamie as the
science is in the film, it isn't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of
the clueless Penelope Ann Miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who
specializes in evolutionary genetics.  Miller acts as if she wants an Oscar
nomination, turning every scene that requires the slightest display of
emotion into an overblown Oscar clip, complete with piercing wails and
glycerine tears.  Give it up, Penelope--it's a _monster_movie_.  On the flip
side, Tom Sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant,
but his role is so thankless that it's hard to imagine it being played any
more effectively.
 It's quite funny to see a film indulge, with the straightest of
faces, in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that Wes Craven lampooned so
well (and so recently) in Scream.  For example, in one early scene, a museum
security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night.  OK, we all know
what's coming, but as if we didn't need any more confirmation, he pulls out
a joint and starts puffing away.  Everyone knows what happens to people who
do drugs in a scary movie.  And later, Miller frantically runs out of a
museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing.  Does she
make a beeline for the front door?  Of course not--she runs into the ladies
room and cowers in a stall.  With all the cliches, it is only fitting the
film's climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film:
that of someone outrunning a fireball.
If The Relic is truly "the next evolution in terror" as the poster
states, then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we
thought.

     Don't be misled by advertising which suggests that THE RELIC is some
sort of sublimely spooky thriller, because it is nothing of the kind.  If
you sit through the film long enough (and several people at the screening
I attended threw in the towel somewhere before the end of the third reel),
you many begin to wonder if you have stumbled through a time warp back to
the early 1980s, when horror films were an excuse to play "can you top
this" with graphic depictions of murders.  For all its ostensibly classy
trappings, THE RELIC is simply a mad slasher film with a monster instead
of a maniac, as relentlessly violent and unpleasant as any film in recent
memory.
     In THE RELIC, Tom Sizemore plays Chicago homicide detective Vincent
D'Agosta, who investigates a Brazilian cargo ship which drifts into Lake
Michigan with the entire crew brutally murdered and decapitated.  When a
similar murder occurs at the Museum of Natural History, D'Agosta tries to
determine the connection between the two incidents.  One possibility may
be a shipment which arrives at the museum from a field anthropologist, a
crate containing mysterious leaves.  When evolutionary biologist Margo
Green (Penelope Ann Miller) examines the leaves, she discovers that the
plant may have the contain hormones which cause extreme mutations in
whatever consumes it.  This discovery may come too late, however, as the
museum prepares to hold a gala benefit which may end with several guests
lacking much above their black ties.
     If you saw Wes Craven's current horror homage/satire SCREAM, you are
acquainted with the "rules" of horror films; if you didn't see SCREAM, you
can learn most of them from THE RELIC.  The likelihood of any given
character to die is proportional to his or her demonstrated vices, so you
can bank on the fact that a security guard who lights up a joint is not
long for this world, nor is a notable nasty like the obnoxious scientist
(Chi Moui Lo) who threatens to steal away Dr. Green's research grant.
Splitting up a group is also a sure sign of carnage to come, especially if
one person alone is carrying a flashlight or investigating any sort of
strange noise.  You can also count on at least one startled animal to
provide a gratuitous shock to the system, to be followed closely by
something genuinely horrifying.
     These elements are familiar for some bad reasons -- usually laziness
-- but also for the good reason that, when put to good use, they can be
part of a truly tense film.  The original ALIEN was a classic bug hunt
crafted with such style by Ridley Scott that everything old seemed new
again.  Peter Hyams pretends to be interested in that kind of primal
chiller, but he has neither the patience nor the skill for it.  The
multi-attributed script tosses personality quirks at its character hoping
something might stick, but only Audra Lindley as an acerbic coroner seems
remotely human.  More often the script resorts to exposition enhancers
like the two kids who turn up to ask what Miller's character does for a
living (there's nothing like turning a screenplay into a catechism to make
sure no one is confused).  Hyams, who has always acted as his own
cinematographer, shoots everything with as little light as possible,
clearly under the impression that atmosphere can be manipulated with a
dimmer switch; meanwhile, the last half of THE RELIC is edited with a
gross disregard for anything resembling building tension.  THE RELIC just
gets louder, darker and more hectic with each passing minute, as Hyams
repeatedly confuses murky with moody.
     There is also something terribly dishonest about the way THE RELIC is
shot, because there is virtually nothing creepy about it.  The old slasher
films of the 80s had no pretensions about what they were there to show the
audience; when someone was going to die a horrible death, they turned up
all the lights and showed you a horrible death.  There are easily a dozen
severed heads which roll through the 110 minutes of THE RELIC, and people
are torn apart with such regularity during the last 50 minutes that it no
longer matters how quickly the light shines on the corpse or how rapid the
edit is.  Hyams finally shows his hand in a sequence where a S.W.A.T. team
enters the museum in an attempt to rescue trapped patrons.  The first man
drops in on a rope and is promptly drawn and quartered; a second man drops
in after him and is separated from his head quite graphically; #3 is
snipped in half below the waist.  At that point, THE RELIC becomes a
turkey shoot where so many anonymous individuals are killed that the
survival of the two main protagonists doesn't matter.  THE RELIC is an
ugly and stupid film, which is bad enough.  It also proves to be a
terribly dehumanizing one.  Special effects wizard Stan Winston might have
created a nifty creature to trot out for the climax, but for all it
mattered to the story, Hyams might as well have saved the budget and used
