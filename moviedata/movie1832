     I like things that play around with time.  THE TIME TUNNEL (remember
that?), BACK TO THE FUTURE, even Graeme Murphy's choreography for the SYDNEY
DANCE COMPANY.  So when a film like AS TIME GOES BY comes along I go and see
it.  I'm glad I did.
     Billed as a sci-fi comedy it has all the right ingredients for a good
movie.  The idea of bringing together a weird mix of characters is a small
outback town lends itself to some good situation comedy and it works well.  The
script, by Barry Peak, progresses along an unpredictable path with a few
interesting and comic twists thrown in.  The pace, though not frantic (would
you expect it to be in a small outback town?), never drops and I often thought
what was going to be next.
     Mike (Nique Needles) is the main character, a surfer who ends up in a small
country town.  This lends itself to a small cast which is great for a couple of
reasons.  Cost - this is a small-budget film.  Development - no character is
redundant.  Simple - the simplicity of the plot does not complicate matters -
it allows the film to exploit the comedy available.
     The acting is good and Max Gillies does a great job displaying his vocal
dexterity as one of the aliens.
