"Little Women" is a very good adaptation of the
Louisa May Alcott classic novel about four daughters
of a Northern Civil War soldier.  While the film
drags towards the end, as sisterly fun is replaced
with worries over romance and sickness, it remains
an impressive production with a fine cast and script.
Many films from the early 1930s look dated today.
This is not the case of "Little Women", which is
as sophisticated as many Hollywood productions of
today.  Perhaps that is partly because the film is
an historical drama, but mostly due to the high
production values.  "Little Women" won the Academy
Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and was nominated
for Best Picture and Director (George Cukor).
The four daughters are brash tomboy and budding author
Jo (Katherine Hepburn), petulant baby sister Amy
(Joan Bennett), sweetly reticent Beth (Jean Parker),
and serious eldest sister Meg (Frances Dee).  Since
this is a movie, all four sisters are very attractive,
close in age, and given diverse and appealing characters.
Although this is one of her earliest films, Hepburn is
clearly the star, and gives an excellent performance.
"Little Women" is certain to appeal to women more than
to men.  There is no action, and the emotions of the
sisters is always the focus of the scenes.  Male characters,
all in supporting roles, are judged by the sisters on
the basis of their character rather than by looks, wealth
or status.  The sisters eventually go their separate ways,
but the family is again reunited at film's end.
Perhaps the adaption is too faithful to the novel.  The
story becomes bittersweet, even a tearjerker.  The first
half is much more fun, and in cinema it isn't necessary
for the daughters to grow up.
