After the unintentional murder of her stepsister for just five Yuan, Tao Lan
is sentenced to jail. Seventeen years later, she was given special pass out
to jail to celebrate new year with her family for three days. But her
parents have moved away and her old resistance demolished, she is at a lost.
With the help of a prison warden, together they go on a journey to search
for Taos family, but when they finally found it, Tao refused to enter the
house, as her guilt overwhelmed her of killing her stepsister
A simple movie with a simple storytelling, and based on a true story,
Seventeen Years deals with guilt and redemption of a family facing with a
past that almost cannot be redeemed. This can also be seen in the final
scenes where Tao Lan reaches home, the scene where the mother confessed to
her husband that she has known all along that her daughter is coming home
today, but she did not tell her husband (After all, the killed stepdaughter
is the husbands daughter.). In the end of the scene where the fathers
thought was opened, where he initially wanted to leave his wife after her
daughters return, but changed his mind when he realised that what he really
loves is his current family.
The title, Seventeen Years, also drives across two meanings, the years Tao
Lan has been in jail for manslaughter, and also the times a girl lost, her
most precious times of her life. This is a film that should be watched, if
anything, for the simple message it drives across.
Note:
Seventeen Years was shown on 15th April 2000 at the 13th Singapore
International Film Festival. Seventeen Years also won the Best Actress and
Best Director for this years Silver screens Awards.
