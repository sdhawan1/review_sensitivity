`But I'm a Cheerleader' so profusely exaggerates its entire premise that the
picture crosses the line from being merely satirical of an already
much-satirized society to being downright stupid. The continuously
hyperbolic nature of the film would be offensive enough to draw complaint
from both homosexuals and heterosexuals but for the fact that such protest
would be dignifying the absurd and thus shedding unneeded light onto what
really amounts to no more than sheer silliness.
Megan (Natasha Lyonne), the captain of her high school's cheerleading squad,
is, on the surface, as spunky yet typical a teen as one could imagine. Her
parents love her and her boyfriend is obsessed with her. But Megan has a
secret that not even she has come to terms with: she is a lesbian. When she
kisses her boyfriend, she thinks of fellow cheerleaders; rather than
loosely-clad guys, her posters feature well-endowed women and when she sees
her pals with little on, her mind wanders into clearly homosexual territory.
Actually, it seems that Megan is the only one who isn't in on her little
secret. Imagine her surprise when her family and friends confront her one
morning and not only explain that they understand her sexual preference
better than her, because they have noticed her Melissa Etheridge posters and
vegetarianism (both, we are told, are clear signs of lesbianism) but that
they are sending her to an expensive, yet highly reputable, program called
`True Directions' to literally straighten her out.
`True Directions' is very much akin to Hollywood's fictional mental
institutions in that it sends a person to your house to pick you up, houses
its occupants in dorm-like buildings with little supervision and features
Clea DuVall (Georgina from `Girl, Interrupted') as its most attractive
female occupant. Like many Hollywood loony-bins, you can tell right off the
bat that the place is full of phonies. RuPaul, out of drag, plays Mike, the
head male counselor (actually, the only male counselor from what we gather).
Mike wears a shirt proclaiming `Straight is Great,' drives a pink van and,
at one point or another, goes through all of the stereotypically gay
movements. Yet, Mike insists that he is `an ex-gay' even though are
suspicions suggest otherwise. Those suspicions are confirmed when he gawks
at another male.
Of course, Mike is merely an example of the filmmaker's message: you are
what you are and nothing can change that. Megan is a lesbian, whether by
genetic predisposition or choice is irrelevant, and she will remain a
lesbian at heart no matter how much propaganda `True Directions' preaches
into her ears.
But it isn't Megan vs. The World or even Megan vs. Goliath  she does have
allies. To begin with, the program's leader makes the mistake of housing a
bunch of teens with raging hormones together  all of whom share the same
sexual preference  and hoping that the simple `no sex' rule will actually
be followed. Ha! Also, aside from her roommates' support, Megan discovers
what she refers to as the `underground homo railroad,' two gay men who
dropped out of the `True Directions' program and, from time to time, take
its current pupils out for a secret night field trip to `Cocksucker,' the
local gay bar. To and fro, they preach anti-conversion  the message that
director Jamie Babbit is clearly endorsing.
Yet, for reasons unbeknownst to this critic, Babbit feels the need to
further ridicule Megan's fictional `True Directions' by making it into the
ultimate stereotype training facility. The girls' dorm is pink, the guys' is
blue. The girls learn housework, the guys study auto-repair. And if the guys
misbehave, they have to spend the whole weekend watching sports. The whole
thing feels like something Lewis Carroll might have written.
The last few scenes of `But I'm a Cheerleader' exercise a set of clichés as
old as pompoms and ridiculous as Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri's Spartan
Spirit cheerleaders. But hey, given the ridiculous nature of the previous
70-someodd minutes of the film, the cast could have joined arms, formed a
chorus line and pumped out a rendition of `Springtime for Hitler' and I
doubt that anyone would be surprised.

     Take director Jon Waters and give him a really good actress like
Natasha Lyonne, a paltry budget of, say, $1 million, and ask him to make
a satire about a "gay rehab camp," and you might come up with something
like But I'm a Cheerleader.
     Then again, Waters might have come up with something funny, like
Pecker.  With such a meaty topic as Family Values ripe for a send-up,
you'd think it would be easy to milk Cheerleader for comic value.
Unfortunately, first-time feature director Jamie Babbit (whose few
credits including directing the MTV series "Undressed" and acting as
script supervisor on The Game) doesn't appear to have much ability
behind the camera, which becomes painfully apparent after only a few
minutes.
     The story follows Megan (Lyonne), a high school cheerleader who
wrestles with lesbian tendencies.  She dreams of women's thighs while
her boyfriend tongue-bathes her.  She even has a Melissa Etheridge
poster.  Naturally, mom and dad want this gayness nipped in the bud, so
they call in "True Directions," a homosexual-rehab group run by Mary
Brown (Cathy Moriarty) that resembles 28 Days detox-center crossed with
a McDonald's kiddie play area.
     Everything at True Directions is cast in hot pink or baby blue (to
let the recruits empathize with their gender), and exercises consist of
learning to vacuum (ladies) and chopping wood (guys).  Naturally, there
are self-affirmations and admissions of homosexuality -- all part of the
road to healing.
     In the clink, Megan meets rough-and-tumble lesbian Graham (Clea
DuVall, looking to make a career out of playing rough-and-tumble lesbian
types), and naturally they fall in love.  Will they run off together and
become societal outcasts or will they graduate?  Well, you need only
wait about 75 zippy minutes to find out.
     But I'm a Cheerleader plays a lot like a sitcom, only not a very
funny one.  (Perhaps a laugh track would have helped?)  The addition of
good actors like Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures) and Michelle
Williams (Halloween: H2O) is far outweighed by using yesterday's
pop-culture jokes like RuPaul (not in drag!), Mink Stole, and especially
Moriarty.  The editing, directing, and cinematography don't help,
either.  (Have fun while you watch: see how many times you can count the
boom microphone drifting into frame!)  The result is a haphazardly
constructed mess that's totally off when it comes to comedic timing, and
essentially unable to muster even the tiniest bit of sympathy for any of
its cast, even if True Directions-style places really do exist.
     But perhaps the most egregious error is casting Natasha Lyonne as a
cheerleader.  Lesbian, yes.  Cheerleader, no.  Lyonne strikes me as more
of a band girl.  Oh right -- I almost forgot -- it's supposed to be a
satire.

   If we accept the premise that most parents want some day
to be grandparents, we'd have to go along with the view that
most parents would be disappointed to discover that their
only son or daughter is gay.  What should they do about the
situation?  The psychologically healthy folks would accept
reality and not make an issue of their frustration.  In New
York, some even cover up their discouragement by marching
in gay parades with signs reading "I'm proud of my gay son
(or daughter)."  Neither of these situations would make for an
amusing movie, so in her directorial debut, Jamie Babbit
plays with a bright premise, then proceeds to make a hash of
her film.
    "But I'm a Cheerleader" shows the influence of the
eminent John Waters on Ms. Babbitt, who even uses a
Waters favorite, Mink Stole, in the role of an Edith Bunker-
like parent.  But Babbitt repeatedly pulls back when her story
is on the verge of laugh-out-loud antics with the result that
her satire is at once too amiable and too obvious.
   The best thing about the movie is the casting of young
Natasha Lyonne ("Slums of Beverly Hills," "American Pie") in
the key role of Megan, a teenaged cheerleader whom her
parents suspect of being a lesbian.  What seems to give her
away to her folks is her fondness for tofu and vegetarianism--
yet despite her posting of a female pin-up in her high-school
locker, she is yet unaware of her own tendencies.  When her
dad, Mr. Bloomfield ("Harold and Maude"'s Bud Court) and
her mom (Mink Stole) whisk her off to a so-called
rehabilitation camp modeled on a series of steps like
Alcoholics Anonymous, Megan finally confronts her
homosexual tendencies when she develops on mad crush on
fellow inmate, Graham ("Girl, Interrupted"'s Clea DuVall). 
The young men and women who share bunks in the lodge
are all gay, all sent by their parents to be "straightened" out
by homophobic director Mary (Cathy Moriarty)--who employs
ex-gay Mike (drag performer Ru Paul Charles) to assign
manly chores like repairing cars to the guys while she
dispenses classes like diaper changing to the young women.
   Production designer Rachel Kamerman has conceived the
girls' rooms in bright pastel colors as befits this candy-coated,
emasculated satire,  making the thoroughly obvious point that
traditional America wants its women to be pretty in pink. 
Stereotypes abound, the homophobic Mary contrived as a
fundamentalist Christian while the boys and girls under her
tutelage with the exception of Graham and Megan are
nerdish, dull, even androgynous.  The picture has just a few
unintentional laughs, the enterprise coming not even close in
quality to Rose Troche's 1994 intelligently funny "Go Fish."
Rated R.  Running time: 81 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER (director/writer: Jamie Babbit; screenwriter:
Brian Wayne Peterson/based on a story by Ms. Babbit; cinematographer:
Jules LaBarthe; editor: Cecily Rhett; cast: Natasha Lyonne (Megan ),
Clea DuVall (Graham), RuPaul Charles (Mike), Cathy Moriarty (Mary
Brown), Eddie Cibrian (Rock), Bud Cort (Peter), Mink Stole (Megan's
Mom), Melanie Lynskey (Hilary), Katharine Towne (Sinead), Dante Basco
(Dolph), Brandt Willie (Jared); Runtime: 84; Lions Gate Films; 1999)
The simple message this one-note film envisions, is that one should
never be who they are not. To show how ridiculous the Fundamentalist
Christian family value adherents have gone in trying to force their
beliefs down everyone's throats, the film shows what they advocate can
be cruel to those who are caught in their moral trips. The debut feature
of Jamie Babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse, she
can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera. The comedy was lame,
the characters were not interesting, only the idea was good if it could
have been developed into a story with more dimensions than the one it
belabored. The stupidity of trying to force someone against their will
from being a homosexual, is treated as a heavy-handed 'Saturday Night
Live' satire routine. There was not enough of a story for it to be
released as a movie. It was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80
or so minutes, which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity. It is
just as tortorous watching this film as it probably is going through
such an indoctrination program.
A typical high school cheerleader in a suburban setting, the sweet,
innocent Megan (Natasha Lyonne), is driven home by her handsome high
school football player boyfriend Jared (Brandt Willie) to find her
family and friends gathered in the living room. They talk her into going
to a rehabilitation camp for homosexuals aptly named True Directions by
presenting her with the evidence of her lesbianism - her vegetarianism,
her Melissa  Etheridge poster, and her lack of responsiveness to her
boyfriend's tongue kisses (while  kissing him, she is looking longingly
over at the cheerleaders). Megan, who just wants to be normal, is
trapped by her self-righteous parents (Mink Stole & Bud Cort), the
dullness of the people in her suburban community, and with the
community's biblically defined gender roles offering no room for another
viewpoint.
The camp offers a 5-step program to rid one of homosexuality. The camp
director, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), is the rigid martinet who is a
walking cliché. Eddie Cibrian as Rock, is Mary's overtly queer son whom
she pretends is normal, used as a demonstrator for sexual correctness
exercises in the program. He is also the groundskeeper making sexual
gestures with his chain-saw, who camps it up to the point of going
over-the-top, losing all proportion for his character as being anything
but a cartoon figure. RuPaul Charles is the ex-gay counselor, whose job
is to straighten out the men ... his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay
tendencies never materialized as funny stuff, just a bad script he was
stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance.
All the boys in the camp were sorry sights, offering neither comedy nor
concern for them. While the girls were all forgettable types, except for
the one rebel who Megan will fall for, Graham (Clea DuVall). Clea is the
only one in the film who belonged in this film and made the most of her
role, making it believable as the rich bitchy girl who knows damn well
that she's a lesbo, but also knows that if she doesn't go through with
this farce of a rehab program, her parents will take away the trust fund
she stands to inherit.
The absurdity of the film is highlighted in its loud set designs, as the
girls are overwhelmed with garish pink and tangerine colored outfits and
room furnishings, while the boys are  furnished with this hideous bright
blue color. The other absurdity is in how artificial the planned steps
are and how meaningless it is to graduate from a program such as this
one. Of course, Megan, who wasn't gay to begin with, realizes that maybe
she could be gay as a result of this treatment.
This is not a good campy film, and to the bargain, after trying to get
laughs for the first half of the film, it then starts to take itself
seriously. But the theme is so absurd, that there really is no message
that can be delivered. Everything about it is strained. Natasha Lyonne
was miscast, she couldn't pull off what was required of the role, to be
someone who awakens in a subtle way to who she really is. She seemed to
be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when
the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for Graham,
there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life. It all
seemed manufactured, leaving the film telling its joke to an audience
they believe will be sympathetic. The problem with that is, the one-note
joke ran dry a long time ago.
I just couldn't wait for the film to end. If you are going to make a
campy B movie, then it takes more than crudeness and over-the-top
performances to make it funny. I'll take my campy film with no pretenses
to art ... let it be a film that is bitingly hilarious (OK, just funny
will do).

     There's something terribly depressing about a wonderful concept
turned into mush by someone who doesn't know how to handle it. The
irritations of a film like THE REPLACEMENTS are far more mundane by
comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly
mediocrity, at worst a bland, pressed and processed Entertainment 
McNugget. BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER, on the other hand, could have been a
brilliant bit of satire. It could have been the kind of film that, even
while preaching to the choir, highlights the magnificent absurdities of a
very hot-button issue. It could have been the CITIZEN RUTH of the "gay
conversion" movement.
     Could've been, but isn't. Jamie Babbit's sloppy, smirking story
introduces us to Megan (Natasha Lyonne), a middle-class girl with a
boyfriend, good Christian parents (But Cort and Mink Stole) and the
enviable life of a high school cheerleader. Her friends and family also
believe that she has a secret-namely, that she harbors unnatural,
unhealthy desires for other women. Megan denies that she's a lesbian, but
nonetheless she is sent to True Directions, a facility for curing
homosexuals headed by the tough love team of Mary (Cathy Moriarty) and
Mike (RuPaul Charles, virtually unrecognizable in male attire). Soon
Megan is deep into the five-step program, but she also finds herself
interested in a surly fellow "patient" named Graham (Clea DuVall) --
interested in an unnatural, unhealthy desire sort of way.
     Somewhere, buried deep in BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER, is the germ of a
risky comic idea: that Megan really isn't gay until she comes to True
Directions, which in effect converts her contrary to their goals by
exposing her to other lesbians. There's something in that idea to anger
virtually anyone, only Babbit doesn't pursue it. Instead, she makes it
clear from the opening minutes that Megan is repressing latent desires,
and that her denials merely represent a state of denial. Even the good
gags Babbit wrings from this variation -- like the photo in Megan's school
locker -- are underlined too obviously, and never reach into truly daring
areas. The campy tone set in the first half-hour, including Moriarty's
drag diva performance, show that Babbit isn't particularly interested in
scathing humor. Simple mockery suits her just fine.
     Even that tone, however, proves to be one she can't sustain. BUT I'M
A CHEERLEADER might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it
initially appears to be, but at least it might have felt consistent. 
Babbit makes the ridiculous decision to bounce back and forth between
scoring points off swishy stereotypes, exploring the conflicts of family
reaction to homosexuality and developing an actual romantic sub-plot. 
There's not nearly enough substance to BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER for its
serious side to feel anything but token, and too many misguided serious
moments to give it a real comic kick. You can feel BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER's
potential bubbling to the surface when the program participants sit around
sharing the "root" for their same-sex desire (one girl's mother wore pants
to her wedding; another saw the horror of her mother as breadwinner while
Dad was unemployed). And you can feel that potential being crushed under
Babbit's leaden heel every time Megan and Graham share a tender moment.
     There are plenty of people who take the idea of converting gays and
lesbians to heterosexuality very seriously, and plenty of people with
same-sex attractions who desperately want such programs to work. Babbit
never seems to clue into that fact, or she would base her satire more
squarely in the growing popularity of these programs. Instead, she lays
out BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER as though the whole idea were self-evidently
ludicrous, and gets lazy about finding the humor in people scrambling for
conformity, acceptance and easy answers to a challenging issue. BUT I'M A
CHEERLEADER simply isn't funny enough often enough, and that's the kiss of
death for a low-budget comedy full of broad performances and careless
story-telling (what happened to the foreshadowing involving another girl's
apparent jealousy of Megan and Graham's relationship?). There's no excuse
for a subject this incendiary to be the stuff of pratfalls and sappy
endings.

The telltale signs were all there.  Megan (Natasha Lyonne) was a
vegetarian who had pictures of female models on her wall and who didn't
like kissing her jock boyfriend, who, with his economy-sized tongue,
slobbered like a Saint Bernard.
Yes, you guessed it.  She must have become a lesbian.  Or at least so
her parents, played by Bud Cort and Mink Stole, figure, which causes
them to hire some deprogrammers from "True Directions" to "fix" their
daughter and show her the way to righteousness again.
"BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER" protests Megan.  Certainly no respectable
All-American cheerleader could harbor secret desires for her fellow
yellers, Megan reasons.
In Brian Wayne Peterson's script, which abides no subtle moments,
Megan's true sexual orientation is never left in question.  From the
very beginning, we see her ogling other feminine bodies.  Director Jamie
Babbit could use some of John Waters's deft touch with comedy.  The
movie's satire is relegated to the visuals, with Rachel Kamerman's
kitschy set decoration and Alix L. Friedberg's colorfully silly costumes
providing almost all of the humor.  The one-joke movie is cute but
rarely funny.
The first time we see the True Direction outfits -- shocking pink for
the girls and iridescent blue for the boys -- they are funny.  But the
uniform jokes quickly wear thin.
One episode has the students (read prisoners) trying to find their
"root," as in what it was that turned them onto a homosexual lifestyle.
One girl says it was because her mother wore pants to her own wedding,
and another claims it was because she attended an all-girl boarding
school.  The simplest explanation of all comes from the girl who
believes it was because she was born in France.
The film's quality test, on which BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER fails miserably,
is what would the movie be like without the outlandish sets and
costumes.  The answer is that there wouldn't be much left.
BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER runs just 1:21.  It is rated R for strong language
and sexual content involving teens and would be acceptable for high
school seniors.

If there was a contest where participants tried to make films in the
same vein as John Waters, But I'm A Cheerleader would be a resoundingly
unanimous winner.  There isn't one aspect of Cheerleader that seems
un-Waters-esque, from the casting, to its brash colors and sets, to the
film's subject matter.  And like a Waters film, Cheerleader is a light
comedy that has the foresight to end before it grows tiresome.
Natasha Lyonne (Detroit Rock City) stars as Megan, a Freemont High
School cheerleader that dates the hunky captain of the school's
playoff-bound football team.  She doesn't seem to enjoy playing tonsil
hockey with her beau, instead staring into space and envisioning the
spandex-covered nether regions of her fellow cheerleaders.  Her locker
is adorned with photographs of well-built women, but Megan doesn't seem
to notice her fondness for the same sex.
At home, Megan's conservative parents (Bud Cort, Dogma, and Mink Stole,
Pecker) nickname their only child `Poodle' but have mixed feelings about
her Melissa Etheridge poster and strict vegetarian/tofu diet.  So the
bible-thumpers call True Directions, a kind of boot camp to `cure'
homosexuality.  Armed with a catchy motto (`Straight is Great'), a True
Direction employee named Mike (played by drag queen RuPaul) arrives at
Megan's house for an intervention.
Despite her pleadings of heterosexuality, Mike eventually takes Megan
back to the TD headquarters.  Although TD offers a bizarre two-month,
five-step program to alleviate your homosexual urges, it unknowingly
promotes it.  Mike is an `ex-gay' who is so far out of the closet that
he's actually back in it.  TD's militant leader (Cathy Moriarty, Crazy
in Alabama) has a son with swishy tendencies (Eddie Cibrian, Third
Watch).  Everything at TD is colored in garish neon pink and blue.  The
women learn how to vacuum and clean rugs, while the boys chop wood and
repair engines.
While most of the critics are bashing Cheerleader for its bawdy,
stereotypical humor, the film went over amazingly well at a benefit
screening I attended for ImageOut, a local gay and lesbian group.  If
you check your political correctness at the door, Cheerleader is a
hoot.  Lyonne shows a cunning talent in physical comedy, and her
performance pushes what could have been a mediocre film to a hilarious
success.
Cheerleader's supporting roles are pretty good, too, especially Melanie
Lynskey (Detroit Rock City) and Clea DuVall (Girl Interrupted), the
latter of whom plays a moody teen inmate again.  Jamie Babbit
(television's Popular) directs from Brian Wayne Peterson's debut
script.  Also worth mentioning is Rachel Kamerman kitschy production
design.

In the over-stereotyped, suburban American, 1950's life-style, Megan is a
cheerleader who doesn't enjoy kissing her handsome jock boyfriend. The
camera peeps in through the windshield as these two make out in the car: the
boyfriend's tongue flopping around like the tail of some decked fish, while
Megan's eyes, wide open and fluttering in all directions, search for
something interesting to take her mind off what her mouth is doing. It's
hilarious.
Soon enough, her God-fearing, homophobic parents, confront her with their
scariest suspicions, "Our daughter's a lesbian!"
An obedient child and by now quite confused, Megan agrees to board at a
countryside "Heterosexual School" with a newly recruited small group of teen
lesbians and gay boys that are in for a "Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver" lesson in how
to be straight. Guys are taught to work on car engines and girls in pink,
learn to scrub stains from burnt pots and pans. And though this
simplistic/comedic angle on the gay issue has been played powerless already,
the edgy dialogue keeps the film fresh, lively and light.
On the phone to her parents, Megan reports, "You were right, I am a
homosexual, but I'll be regular soon." Then in defending her favorite
pastime she says to Graham (the tomboy dorm mate she is trying not to find
attractive), "Okay, maybe cheers aren't intellectual, but they make people
feel good." Graham snaps back, "No, cheers make people do stupid cartwheels,
orgasms make people feel good!" Kudos to the acting talent of both Natasha
Lyonne and Clea DuVall.
The art directors have painted each room of this large country house its own
special color, with an exterior of pink giving the whole scenario a
purposefully ridiculousness, cartoony feel. However, the music,
intentionally rinky-dink, adds little.
Though surreal and silly, the film is not afraid to say or do the taboo, so,
if girls kissing each other on the lips makes you squint your eyes and feel
nauseous then you ought to be forewarned. In fact, these scenes are done
tenderly.
The look of the film is somewhat over-exposed and technically just barely
short of the mark with an embarrassingly poorly cut scene just prior to the
climax. Still, it's wacky fun, and spiced with loose lips and one-liners
that'll more often than not crack up the crowd.
