     NORTHERN LIGHTS is, in my opinion, an incredibly boring film, an
absolute waste of time!  It is about the forming of the Nonpartisan
League around 1917 to help Nebraska farmers get better money for their
crops.  It is mostly narrated by one of these farmers who is trying to
help the Nonpartisan League  get started.
     I saw NORTHERN LIGHTS at my local art/import theater and I can
easily say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  It is
filmed in grainy black and white with mostly just talking which gives it
the appearance, at least, of being a very cheap film.   Many times
during the film, to just barely keep from falling asleep, I found my
self counting the seats in the theater and hoping for it to get over
soon (because I won't walk out of a film in the theaters).  Many people
in the theater did walk out before the film was over, however.
     NORTHERN LIGHTS was first released in 1978 and has never made it to
videocassette.  It just keeps circling around small theaters that get
it.  I highly recommend that if this film comes to a theater in your
area that you miss it.  On a scale of zero to five, I give NORTHERN
LIGHTS a *big* zero.  NORTHERN LIGHTS is unrated and contains nothing
objectionable (or anything interesting for that matter).  I personally
feel that nobody,even if you are interested in this period or the
Nonpartisan League, would like this film.
