   To paraphrase Tolstoy, middle class families are all alike
but slum dwellers are different in their own ways.  Those who
are ghettoized in America's inner cities suffer the pathologies
of isolation, but trendy middle-class kids often mimic their
style of dress, walk and talk. Those who are ghettoized in
Scotland's inner cities suffer as well, but have not formed a
distinct culture that any of their more prosperous countrymen
would want to echo.  In Lynne Ramsay's first feature film,
"Ratcatcher," the anguish of living in one of Glasgow's slums
during the 1970s is accentuated by a strike of the garbage
collectors, known there as dust-men, and through some
striking imagery Ramsay captures the ambience of a series
of miserable blocks in a Glaswegian tenement district.
   The film focuses on an expressive 12-year-old lad named
James (William Eadie), whose impoverished family have been
waiting for the local council people to move them from a rat-
infested area to three-bedroom digs situated in a rural area. 
While James occasionally laughs, particularly in moments of
affection for his sister and while watching his parents cuddle
with each other in some rare flashes, he is an unhappy young
man whose life has been made just a bit more miserable
because he has unwittingly caused the death of a playmate. 
When James's friend falls into a canal near home, James
makes no effort to save him or to alert his family to the
tragedy; yet because of his age and his limited outlook, he
feels only a limited sense of guilt that a more mature man
would be expected to comprehend.  
   The film opens on a young boy being pressured by his
mother to visit his father, but the boy runs off to play and is
pushed into a canal by James while the two are having a
mud fight, and somehow drowns.  While a more commercial
film might deal with the tragedy by taking off on the theme of
this accidental homicide, Ramsay instead takes us on a
journey into the small world of which James is a part.  We
are introduced to his dad (Tommy Flanagan), who is a drunk
but who expresses his affection from time to time for those in
his family; his mom (Mandy Matthews), who survives on her
hopes for the new home; Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen),
who is sexually exploited by the local gang but whose
motives in passively accepting the boys are unexplored; and
Kenny (John Miller), James's animal-loving pal, who dreams
of being a zookeeper.
   Lynne Ramsay's movie tolerates occasional rough editing,
and the story is episodic rather than tightly-knit--and
deliberately so.  The director is intent on conveying the
ambience of slum life in Scotland's largest city thirty years
ago and appears to pay homage to Francois Truffaut's 1959
masterpiece, "The 400 Blows."  But she departs from the
French director's theme by portraying young people who
spend their days in routine petty mischief and casual sexual
exploits where Truffaut emphasized the life of small-time
crime among Parisian youth who are reacting to derelict
parents.  Ramsay's strongest point is not the story, since this
Ken Loach-like tale is scarcely an original take on the lower
depths.  Instead she hits an emotional chord in her audience
by a series of masterly images, the best being a surreal shot
of a pet mouse which Kenny shackles to a basket and, with
the help of a toy balloon launches the rodent all the way to
the moon.   If James cannot be equally airborne, he can
escape from the blunt dramas of his sordid family life by
taking a bus trip as far as he has ever been--to a corn field
on which sits the half-finished house that his family hopes
soon to inhabit.
   William Eadie's acting helps make this drama an
enlightening and intense experience.  Whether he joins his
fellows in taking out his frustrations by beating the huge rats
that inhabit the mountains of garbage on his block, or looks
with some hope on a future free of the lice-infested
neighborhood made all the worse during the dust-men's
strike, he is at the core of this naturalistic tale.  The final
scene is the piece de resistance, comparing James's actual
fate with what have been.

     Lynne Ramsay's first feature is set in the grim and grimy world of 
Glasgow's public housing projects, during a garbage strike that has left 
the already bleak cityscape strewn with mountains of black plastic bags 
where rats swarm and children play.  And yet it's not exactly about 
poverty.  Ramsay's characters have food and shelter, decent clothing,  
telly, and dance records.  They have a subsistence level of comfort.  
What they don't have is hope.
     Ramsay, a former still photographer, begins her film with the 
almost still image of a little boy twisting inside a plastic shower 
curtain.  It suggests a caul, or a shroud, or a ghost.  The sound is 
muted, the action is in extreme slow motion, until the boy's mother 
cuffs him and tells him to stop messing with her shower curtain, and 
sends him outside to play.  He meets a friend, James, they horse around 
in the shallow canal that runs by the projects, and a moment later he's 
drowned. 
     "That wasn't your main character," Ramsay is telling us, "this is 
your main character," and the next hour and a half deals with the 
forlorn, guilt-heavy existence of skinny, pinch-faced, jug-eared James 
(William Eadie).  Or perhaps she's offering the thought that they're 
interchangeable, these children trapped in an environment from which 
there seems to be no escape.
     But of course they're not interchangeable.  James has little in 
common with the gang of thuggish older boys who pick on him and 
gang-bang the resigned, compliant 14-year-old Margaret Anne (Leanne 
Mullen).  But then James is still pre-adolescent; there's no telling 
what changes a few more years in the projects might bring.
     His parents (Tommy Flanagan and Mandy Matthews) have had a few more 
years in the projects, though they're still young.  Their dream is to 
get out of the projects - into new projects which are being built in a 
wheat field on the edge of town.  James finds his way there on a bus, 
and spends a rapturous afternoon exploring the half-finished apartments 
and imagining, a scene reminiscent of the Joad children at the model 
camp in The Grapes of Wrath.  But eventually, of course, urban sprawl 
will encompass the new buildings and drag them down, and future 
generations will plot and dream to escape them.
     Ramsay has a wonderful eye and ear for her characters, and a gift 
for imagery.  Unfortunately much of the movie is dark, murky, groping 
its hand-held way through impenetrable shadows.  But she sketches her 
story without pathos, and without heavy-handed symbolism.  Water serves 
as a vehicle for casual death.  It's also the setting for a lovely scene 
where James and Margaret Anne take a bath together, as comfortable and 
unerotic as an old married couple.  And it provides a moment of heroism 
for James's Da, who rescues a boy from drowning, gets a medal, and 
probably messes up his family's chances for the new housing project.  
The boy he saves is a simpleminded friend of James's who, amidst the 
swarming vermin of the garbage strike, gets a pet white mouse for his 
birthday, and sends it on a strange trip.
     Ratcatcher is spoken in an urban Scots brogue so thick that the 
filmmakers have wisely subtitled it in English, reminiscent of an early 
Ken Loach film like Kes.

RATCATCHER, the first feature film by writer and director Lynne Ramsay, 
could have been called BLEAK AND BLEAKER.  Unrelentingly downbeat, it 
tells a story of a family stuck in a miserable existence in the Glasgow 
slums.  Although the family lives in dire conditions, the movie is never 
able to define any of its characters enough for us to care about their 
plight.  With this rambling movie, which is only slightly better 
organized than a home video, Ramsay demonstrates almost no ability at 
storytelling.  When the inevitable tragic ending occurs, you almost have 
to stop yourself from applauding since you are so glad to get this waste 
of time over with.
As the story starts, James, a young lad of about 12, is involved in some 
innocent horseplay beside a canal.  His companion, Ryan, is accidentally 
drowned in the process.  James is played without one scintilla of 
emotion by William Eadie, who had never acted before being chosen for 
the part.  It shows.  Playing the central character, Eadie is asked to 
carry the movie, a task of which he is totally incapable.
The rest of James's family are walking clichés.  His father (Tommy 
Flanagan), for example, is a drunk who passes out frequently, causing 
him to drool on the living room sofa.  The wife is the canonical 
long-suffering type who stands by her man.  The only character of any 
interest in the story is a neighborhood girl named Margaret Anne (Leanne 
Mullen), who dispenses sexual favors to everyone for unexplained 
reasons, possibly in a failed attempt to be liked.  The character has 
potential, but Mullen's lifeless performance doesn't do much with it.
As the characters go from tedious tribulation to tribulation, I found 
myself passing the time by observing how Scottish English differs from 
American English.  The subtitling for the film doesn't try to translate 
the words.  It just records them to make them more intelligible for 
American audiences.  Among other words I found fascinating were: heid, 
innit and frae.
My wife said it best.  "The depressing thing about this movie is that it 
isn't depressing," she remarked, shaking her head, as we left the 
theater.  With circumstances this tragic, we should feel sad, but we 
don't because the movie is so poorly constructed and the acting so 
incredibly bland.
RATCATCHER runs a long 1:33.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
sexual situations, nudity, violence and language.  It would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.

RATCATCHER (director/writer: Lynne Ramsay; cinematographer: Alwin Kuchler;
editor: Lucia Zucchetti; cast: William Eadie (James), Tommy Flanagan (Da), Mandy
Matthews (Ma), Lynne Ramsay, Jr. (Anne Marie), Michelle Stewart (Ellen), Leanne
Mullen (Margaret Anne), John Miller (Kenny), Jackie Quinn (Mrs. Quinn); Runtime:
94; BBC Films/Holy Cow Films; 1999-UK) 
A gritty and realistic tale about a troubled adolescent boy of 12, James
(Eadie), growing up in the slums of Glasgow who dreams of escaping. Lynne
Ramsay's brilliant debut film as director (she also wrote the screenplay) is set
around a tenement block of project houses during a garbage strike in the
mid-'70s where the streets are lined with bags of garbage, as she captures in a
beautifully significant way the pathos and squalor of slum life. 
The film opens as an omen to death is presented, as a preadolescent boy named
Ryan is spinning his whole body around while he is wrapped around a lace window
curtain that resembles a shroud; the scene shifts from slo-mo to real time as
his mother angrily pulls him out of the curtain, and he runs outside to play in
the muddy canal--which is filled with vermin, but is the nearest thing to a park
the neighborhood kids have to play in. 
Ryan meets James there and they get into a playful spat, and James accidently
drowns him and runs away. This sets the lugubrious tone for the film, as this
secret haunts him as he retreats into a world of solitude, bitter friendships, a
relationship with an older girl who is the neighborhood slut, and a strange
relationship with his family. He deems that the answer to his problem, is to
escape from the neighborhood by moving into a new home. 
To make matters worst, as far as his guilt, the dead boy's mother (Jackie Quinn)
gives him her son's new shoes because he reminds her of her son. 
The film paints a grim picture of his family, though it's certainly not the
worst family to raise kids. There's his father (Flanagan) who is usually drunk
or watching TV, which he's more interested in than he's in the kids; his earnest
ma (Matthews), who remembers when she used to dance joyfully to pop music but is
morosely overwhelmed by raising the family in a caring way; there's his
secretive older sister (Stewart) who treats him with contempt; and, his bratty
younger sister, Ann Marie (Lynne Ramsay, Jr.), who will drop a dime on him to
her daddy without changing her innocent childlike expression. The family is
rooted in poverty and are trapped by their lack of ambition and education. 
The film's most tender moment comes when James seeks comfort more than sex with
the neighborhood slut, Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), and he seems sated to just
clean the lice out of her hair and take a bath with her. They imitate in their
encounter what they think a contented married couple should be like. 
This impressive debut film is visually very powerful, it has plenty of images to
relate to what's burning inside James. The camera follows James around town as
he hangs out with the more rugged older neighborhood boys, his daffy friend
Kenny who sends his pet mouse to the moon on a ballooon, or when we watch him as
he wanders across a yellow field to look at a new housing development site going
up while he dreams of living there. This audacious film seems like a nightmare,
or a dream that James can't wake up from. The result is a lyrical work that has
a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images; it's a film of high
quality.
