     It seems that everybody these days wants to be a director.  Some
people have the gift, but others are lacking.  First time feature film
director Alan Taylor tries his had at a farce with PALOOKAVILLE.
Granted the music by Rachel Portman (EMMA, SIRENS, and THE JOY LUCK
CLUB) is full of great whimsy, but the picture itself is dreadful and
mean spirited to boot.  Perhaps Taylor has promise, but PALOOKAVILLE is
on the debit side of almost everyone's ledger who has a part in it.
     The press kit claims that although PALOOKAVILLE was filmed in
Jersey City, its roots are in Italy.  Specially, they cite Italo
Calvino's short stories about Italians trying to make ends meet
economically after the war.  Well, I've never read the stories, but I
hope they are not as shallow as this movie.
     In the putatively funny opening sequence, three bumbling robbers,
Sid (William Forsythe), Russ (Vincent Gallo), and Jerry (Adam Trese),
drill a hole in the rear of a jewelry store wall.  Rather than finding
riches of diamonds and rubies, they find tray after tray of jelly
donuts.  It seems that they went through the wrong wall.
     Perhaps with a more deft approach, this scene could have been
funny, but David Epstein's script lacks much subtlety.  The robbers
steal and eat the donuts getting jelly on their faces and powered sugar
all over their clothes.  One robber continues to steal the donuts right
next to the cops when they arrive.  Even hours later, these Three
Stooges quality thieves still have not wiped their mouths or brushed
off their clothes.
     Since their life of crime is not yielding the abundant rewards for
which they had hoped, one of them suggests they switch to a scheme of
running an illegal taxicab for old people.  Russ says they should stick
to their original plan since, "I'm not talking about a life of crime,
just a momentary shift in lifestyle."  To keep from getting prosecuted
for armed robbery, his solution is toy guns.  "The thief gets the
benefit of the doubt.  Most crooks in this country use cap guns."
     Russ is a dreamer.  As a come-on line to his neighbor Laurie
(Bridgit Ryan), he tells her, "Why don't I take you to California.  You
can have fresh squeezed orange juice every day.  If you've got a back
yard there, you've got fresh fruit."
     Actually, there is only one part of the film I like.  Russ and
Laurie have windows facing each others.  After she flashes him one
night in the cute and only nude scene in the picture, their romance
starts heating up.  She likes to strip naked, get into her raincoat,
and then crawl into his bedroom through his window.  And vice versa of
course.  In a better movie, I might have criticized this little
romantic subplot as needless, but here I appreciated the diversion from
the plodding main plot.
     The show has other known actors including Gareth Williams, Lisa
Gay Hamilton, and most wasted of all, Frances McDormand (FARGO).  I am
a fan of McDormand's, but her performance in PALOOKAVILLE is lifeless.
     In a film that tries to charm you, but is so dreadfully dull that
boredom is the only consist reaction to it, there is one funny little
scene.  When Russ's brother-in-law and cop Ed comes in one evening, the
three would be bandits are watching the old black and white film
ARMORED CAR ROBBERY.  They are studiously taking notes, and this does
arouse suspicions in Ed.
     PALOOKAVILLE is mercifully only 1:33 long.  It is rated R for
brief nudity and strong language.  The film would be fine for any
teenager.  I see no reason to waste your time with it so it gets a big
thumbs down from me and a measly single * only for Bridgit Ryan's small
part.  The press kit says she will be in GREAT EXPECTATIONS with Robert
De Niro, Ethan Hawke, and Gwyneth Paltrow so she will get a much better
chance than this slight movie.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

PALOOKAVILLE(1995) *** Directed by Alan Taylor. Written by David Epstein.
Photography, John Thomas. Editing, David Leonard. Production design, Anne
Stuhler. Music, Rachel Portman. Cast: William Forsythe (Sid), Vincent Gallo
(Russ), Adam Trese (Jerry), Lisa Gay Hamilton (Betty), Kim Dickens
(Laurie),et al. A Samuel Goldwyn Co., release. 92 min. Rated R.(language)
The start of this movie is so amusing that what follows could have been an
anticlimax. It isn't though. The setting is contemporary Jersey City, a
shabby decaying town across the river from the wealth of New York City's
often shown skyscrapers.
Three unemployed, longtime buddies decide to resort to crime--strictly
temporarily.Likable and most unprofessional, in these high-tech times they
use primitive tools to try burglarizing a jewelry store. Instead, they
break into the adjoining bakery, where Jerry keeps gobbling pastries and
stuffing donuts inside his shirt. The sequence is treated with sweet
absurdism, close to Inspector Clouseau territory.
The protagonists' dwellings are low-income, cramped quarters. Interiors and
exteriors could, by and large, have been settings of past decades.Even the
pals' only car is an old clunker.
Handsome Jerry has a kid and a breadwinner wife. Betty is black. This helps
situate the film in recent times and adds a warm element  as absolutely no
special point is made of it.
Sid, whose spouse left him, lives with two shaggy, smelly dogs.
Saturnine-looking Russ lives with his mother, his sister, and her husband,
a sullen cop. Russ occasionally visits a friendly prostitute (Frances
McDormand in a cameo appearance) and regularly goes to bed with young,
pretty Laurie, who lives across the back alley and dreams of
California.Visits are easy as both have street-level bedroom windows.
After bungling their first job, the buddies plot others, with Russ as the
self-appointed brains and leader. Their discussions at their usual cafe can
be quite funny. One man dreams up the semi-legitimate notion of an
unlicensed car service for older people who can hardly afford cabs,
assuming these do show up. The smell of Sid's mutts, as they too travel in
the car,quickly sinks that scheme.
A somewhat forced incident suggests a plot involving an armored car. The
plan is hare-brained, the preparations dumbly funny. They include watching
a video of the 1950 movie "Armored Car Robbery" -- a pretty good film but
absurd in "Palookaville"'s context. The execution is comical. Connected,
unconnected and disconnected episodes flesh out the story, the characters,
the milieu
"Palookaville" is an amalgam loosely based on three early short stories by
Italo Calvino who wrote of the plight of ordinary Italians in the
post-World War II years.The atmosphere gets convincingly transferred to the
USA now.There is also the inspiration from the familiar Italian satire "Big
Deal on Madonna Street" (1958) which was about a gang of incompetent
amateur thieves. (The cast included Marcello Mastroianni, then known but
not yet made a major star by Fellini movies).
The director's first feature and the scriptwriter's first produced
screenplay, "Palookaville"  won the Kodak Prize for Best First Feature at
the 1995 Venice Film Festival. Some   inexperience shows in a certain lack
of clarity about people and places. I am no lover of artificial,
all-explaining expositions but I appreciate what might be called the
Hitchcockian introduction, where you don't have to wonder who is who,
where, and what to whom. And while the main music theme is witttily
Italianate, it gets repetitious.
Otherwise, there are fine gags (the suspecting cop and brother-in-law seen
sniffing Russ' pants by Laurie across the alley is a classic moment) and no
villains. The general shabbiness is,without stressing it, a comment on
financially depressed little people in America today. Yet the overall mood
keeps us smiling with its un-gloppy affection for the three losers.

     If you thought the criminals in BOTTLE ROCKET and FARGO were 
incompetent, wait until you meet the trio from PALOOKAVILLE...  They 
can't seem to get anything right.  Nevertheless, what separates this 
film from the many other crime-gone-wrong pictures is that it's almost 
completely non-violent.  There are no shoot outs, fistfights, or 
explosions.  There is a gun, but it's used primarily as a prop.
     PALOOKAVILLE (the title is from the classic Marlon Brando line in 
ON THE WATERFRONT about losers) is the debut feature for director Alan 
Taylor, who has used the stories of post-WWII Italian author Italo 
Calvino and the 1956 comic heist movie, BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET, as 
inspirations.  This film, which takes place in Jersey City, New Jersey, 
chronicles the failed robbery attempts of three inept protagonists:  Sid 
(William Forsythe), Russell (Vincent Gallo), and Jerry (Adam Trese).  
The problem is, while these "self-unemployed" men need money to pay the 
rent, none has the kind of personality necessary for a life of crime.  
As Jerry says, "We're not really cut out for this.  Some people are.  
For instance, criminals."
     PALOOKAVILLE opens with a jewelry store robbery gone bad -- but not 
in RESERVOIR DOGS fashion.  Here, it's a bloodless, customerless night 
operation, with Russ and Jerry knocking a hole in the back brick wall 
while Sid stands guard out front.  The problem is, they've got the wrong 
store -- it's a bakery adjacent to the jewelers, and the booty ends up 
being jelly donuts and pastries instead of diamonds and gold.
     Following this first failed caper, the gang tries to go straight, 
but their good intentions don't last long.  Eventually, they hatch a 
plot to rob an armored car.  It's not a very good plan -- parts are 
culled from the old RKO movie, ARMORED CAR ROBBERY -- but they seem to 
think it's foolproof.  Inevitably, however, when it comes to pulling the 
heist, Murphy's Law is in full force, and nothing goes the way anyone 
expected.
     One of the things that elevates PALOOKAVILLE over the likes of 
BOTTLE ROCKET and THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD is its 
character development.  Although this film is sprinkled with comic 
moments and its tone is basically lighthearted, it treats its 
protagonists seriously.  Sid, Russ, and Jerry seem like real people -- 
losers with good hearts who want to commit crimes but lack the requisite 
toughness and cynicism.  Through their relationships with women and 
their illegal activities, each of PALOOKAVILLE's main characters learns 
something about himself and the world.
     The lead actors -- William Forsythe (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER), 
Vincent Gallo (THE PEREZ FAMILY), and Adam Trese (THE UNDERNEATH) -- are 
effective in their roles, and they're given solid support by Frances 
McDormand (as a local prostitute), Gareth Williams (as Russ' policeman 
brother-in-law), and Bridgit Ryan (as a young woman who falls for Sid).  
The best performance is turned in by Forsythe, playing against type as a 
shy man who acts like he lost his wife to death, not divorce.  Gallo's 
Russ would like us to believe that he's a tough hood, but his hard 
personality is really a front.  And Jerry just wants an alternative 
source of income so his wife doesn't have to work for the sleazy store 
manager who gropes her.
     With an evocative score by Rachel Portman and cinematography by 
John Thomas, PALOOKAVILLE has a feel that belies its $1 million budget.  
At times, the movie is funny, touching, and quirky.  There are a few 
isolated scenes that don't work, but, in general, PALOOKAVILLE 
represents insouciant entertainment bolstered by an unforced message 
about not taking the "American dream" too seriously.  After all, the 
people in PALOOKAVILLE may be losers with little hope of rising above 
their circumstances, but that doesn't mean they don't have hearts and 
souls.
     After winning the Kodak award for Best First Feature at the 1995 
Venice Film Festival, PALOOKAVILLE has become a festival favorite.  
Although it's not due to be released until September of 1996 (and then 
only in a limited run), it will be shown at dozens of festivals during 
the spring, including those in Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and 
Philadelphia.  And, although it may appear Tarantino-inspired at a 
glance, once you get into PALOOKAVILLE, you'll understand that it has a 
much kinder, gentler story to tell.
