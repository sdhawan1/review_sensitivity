Mimi Leder's directorial debut was also the first theatrical release
from the newly formed Hollywood studio Dreamworks SKG. S for Steven
Spielberg, K Jeffrey Katzenberg, G for David Geffen. 
PLOT:
Russian bad guys steal some nuclear warheads from a train. Good
Military Guy Devoe (Clooney), and Nuclear Expert Kelly (Kidman) are the
two American wunderkinds appointed to find the warheads and save the
world from a possible nuclear disaster. 
CRITIQUE:
Mostly unexciting, humdrum romp that doesn't really offer us any real
action or suspense until the last half an hour. Set in various
international destinations, this jargon-filled strategy session set
amongst military folk, nuclear experts and politicians, is the movie
equivalent of a long day at the dentist's office. Warning: There is a
lot of talking in this film, and very little action. The special
effects are limited to one great nuclear blast at the beginning of the
picture, and many redundant explosions throughout the rest of the
flick.
Clooney does okay in his wise-cracking, super-Special-Forces dude role,
while Kidman literally runs through her part like she's in a hurry to
get to London to film Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT with her
husband, Tom Cruise. The rest of the cast just seem like a bunch of
people standing around and taking orders from either of the two stars.
And coincidentally enough, both stars always seem to be right. How
exciting! Yawn.
The last forty minutes finally wakes us from the numbing sensation
induced by the film's first hour and a half delivery (alas, Mrs. JoBlo
couldn't make it all the way through), and does actually deliver some
pretty neat suspense, good action, and a centered point of reference.
Other than that, this film does not deliver in regards to its "thrills"
moniker one bit, and will leave many a thriller fan invariably
disappointed. Mind you, if you enjoy films that seem to realistically
encapsulate the essence of being part of an actual governmental body of
people chasing after bad guys, then you might enjoy most of the
talkie-talkies in this film. I did not. 
 I would like to take this moment to thank those "powers
that were" who did forsake us from the otherwise obvious Clooney/Kidman
cheap romance. For that, and only that, I thank you.   
Little Known Facts: 
George Clooney stands 5"10, was born in Kentucky, owns a pet pig, has
taught actresses Kirsten Dunst to drive (on a golf cart) and Laurie
Metcalf to drive a stick shift, is cousins with actor Miguel Ferrer,
and nephew to singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. He also flailed through
many TV sitcoms before settling into his dramatic shoes at ER
("Roseanne" and "The Facts of Life" are two of the shows in which he
briefly participated).
Nicole Kidman also stands 5"10, was born in Hawaii, but brought up in
Australia, and has two adopted children with her husband of eight
years, Tom Cruise. She is a high-school dropout.
Mimi Leder directed many episodes of the popular NBC TV drama ER,
starring the ever-popular George Clooney, before making her debut as a
movie director with this film (I wonder how he got this gig?).

I suppose there are many ways of telling a story that deals with nuclear
terrorism and while 'The Peacemaker' decides it's going to be an action film
filled with gunfire, chases and explosions, it really isn't all that
exciting.  That isn't to say that it lacks merit in other areas such as
casting, location filming and brisk editing.  What it boils down to is an end
result that can't escape its own predictability.  If you're willing to
overlook these flaws, you will be generally entertained but never moved.
 'The Peacemaker' is the first film from Dreamworks Pictures which is the
creation of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen and they
have aimed their first film directly at the average movie goer rather than at
a more broad range of movie tastes.
George Clooney plays a military officer who leads a team to find stolen
nuclear weapons involving participants from the new Russia and Bosnia.
 Nicole Kidman is a nuclear scientist working with him.  She's the voice and
Clooney is the muscle in carrying out the mission.  The film's first half
hour is rather difficult to follow as the characters introduced to the
audience are secondary and remain that way for the entire movie.  Oddly
enough, I had the precarious feeling I was watching the set up to a James
Bond movie and that I had seen it all before.  The American government, using
their satellite tracking devices from outer space, learn of the dilema and
proceed to stop it.  Their search takes them to many places and the film's
climax takes place back in America.
Director Mimi Leder and screenwriter Michael Schiffer work on a similar
parallel in using extreme violence in many circumstances to make their point
and what makes 'The Peacemaker' an acceptable thriller is that both leads
(Clooney and Kidman) maintain an impressive and equal amount of talent in
proceeding to save the world.  Neither one of their characters is above the
other and I thought that was appropriate.  Unfortunately, this first effort
from Dreamworks takes its audience for granted most of the time and that is a
disappointing start for the new studio.

     "God, I miss the cold war," confesses national security advisor
Jerry Hamilton.  Someone has set off an A-bomb in the heart of Russia,
and no one knows why.
     Back in the old days, both sides in the arms race stockpiled
nuclear weapons in the world's biggest game of chicken.  So long as the
other side wasn't sure that their cache was bigger, they could be
counted on not to fire first.  But those cozy days of the great
standoff are gone forever like the five-cent soda pop.
     Today, Russia is dismantling her nukes, and THE PEACEMAKER, the
first film, from Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David
Geffen's new studio, Dreamworks SKG, considers what would happen if
some criminal entrepreneurs stole a batch of nuclear weapons and began
selling them on the black market.
     Emmy award winning television director Mimi Leder tries her hand
at her first theatrical movie with powerful success, albeit after an
uneven first half.  The second half is consistently thrilling, so don't
give up on it when it bogs down at first.
     A group of Russian criminals steal ten atomic bombs from a train
in a daring and well executed piece of cinematic action.  They explode
one as a subterfuge and then sneak off with the other nine to make
their fortune.
     Back in the U.S., Dr. Julia Kelly, played unconvincingly by Nicole
Kidman, is the acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group.
Dr. Kelly, who has the fate of millions in her hands, dresses like a
fashion model.  Her translucent, silky white blouse is complemented by
a skin-tight mini-skirt.  She is permitted to let her shirttail come
out a bit to show that she really does work for a living.  All of this
notwithstanding, her casting does add a bit of fun to the film.
     To do her dirty work she is assigned an Army intelligence officer
named Colonel Tom DeVoe, played by George Clooney in his best movie
performance to date.  Colonel DeVoe operates by schmoozing with his
Russian counterparts, especially General Dimitri Vertikoff, well acted
in all too small a part by Armin Mueller-Stahl.  The colonel, however,
is not above James Bond-ish violence when the situation calls for it.
     Therein lies the problem in the film's first part.  One minute it
wants to be a typically unrealistic James Bond clone, the next a
hyper-accurate Tom Clancy film, and the next a serious meditation on
the troubles in Bosnia.  Every time the show gains momentum, the story
switches to a slow moving Bosnian episode.  In the best parts, as when
the satellite imagery is used to track the truck with the purloined
bombs, the audience becomes engrossed in the details.  Michael
Schiffer's clever script has the colonel calling the truck's cell phone
and telling the driver that a bomb is on the way -- it isn't -- so that
they can see which truck in the long convoy is carrying the bomb.  It
is the one making a fast exit.
     "I'm not afraid of the man who wants ten nuclear weapons,
Colonel," reflects Dr. Kelly.  "I'm terrified of the man who only wants
one."  Eventually they get all of the bombs but that one.  The film's
second half, set in Manhattan, concerns the tracking down of the last
bomb.  By then, Leder has found her footing and the film never again
flags.  The audience is on the edge of its seats in the finale as our
two heroes run frantically all over the city trying to find the
villains who have the bomb.  And when they do, the script again
surprises by not using the standard cliche of "do we cut the red wire
first or the green."
     With a reworked beginning, THE PEACEMAKER could have been an
outstanding picture rather than merely an entertaining one.  Even so,
Mimi Leder's first theatrical film is well worth the price of
admission.
     THE PEACEMAKER runs 2:02.  It is rated R for profanity and
violence.  The film would be fine for teenagers.  I recommend the
picture to you and give it ***.

THE PEACEMAKER
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 DreamWorks Pictures
 Director:  Mimi Leder
 Writer:  Michael Schiffer
 Cast: George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Marcel Iures,
Alexander Baluev, Rene Medvesek, Gary Werntz, Randall
Batinkoff, Jim Haynie, Alexander Strobele, Holt McCallany
   "The peacemakers must be made to feel pain."  Now that
doesn't sound too logical, but when this movie's principal
villain makes that strange announcement, he hopes that the
audience which will make "The Peacemaker" numero uno at
the box office will sympathize just a little with
him.  The peacemakers of the title are the governments of the
U.S. and Western Europe, but paradoxically, they may have
caused more violence by their actions than your average
warmonger.  As implied by Dusan Gavrich--whose role is
performed by Romania's Marcel Iures--the powers that
imposed their so-called peace settlements on his native
Bosnia actually created friction by compressing populations of
historical enemies like Serbs, Muslims and Croats.  As a
result Dusan's beloved child is shot down before his eyes. He
is determined at this point to punish not the actual killer but
the governments which, he is convinced, set the stage for the
atrocity.  Hence his scheme to vaporize a ten-square block
around the United Nations building in New York, where a
treaty is about to be signed.
   "The Peacemaker," like many other movies of the genre,
requires the audience to suspend reality more than they are
requested to do for, say, romantic melodramas or even light
comedies.  There is so much activity packed into this two-
hour show that you can be forgiven for a little confusion. 
What seems to be going on is a two-pronged scheme.  One is
Dusan's design to clear the traffic jam on New York's
Upper East Side. The other is a scheme by General
Alexsander Kodoroff (played by the Moscow Academy Art
Theater-trained Russian actor Alexander Baluev) to hijack ten
nuclear devices from a speeding train, truck them to Iran, and
return with big bucks.  The Russian mafia--which supplies the
trucks--is involved, of course, and so it remains for Dr. Julia
Kelly (Nicole Kidman) and Col. Thomas Devoe (George
Clooney) to save the U.S. from the Ayatollahs and secure
Bloomingdale's from an enraged and self-pitying terrorist.  
   The picture features some striking scenery, of both
mountainous areas and Olde Worlde streets, captured by
photographer Dietrich Lohmann in such exotic areas as
Slovakia and Macedonia, which stand in for Sarajevo and
surrounding Bosnia.  The opening scenes come on strong in
the James Bond style, as General Kodoroff and followers
equipped with laser guns and coal-miners' hats take over the
train carrying the Big Berthas on the way to being defused
under treaty agreements.  But as one soldier says, "I didn't
joint the Russian army to see it dismantled by the Americans,"
which gains the response, "The world is changing."
   The world changes as well for Julia Kelly, a nuclear
scientist who as acting head of the White House Nuclear
Smuggling Group reports directly to the president.  Though a
decisive individual accustomed to having her rapid-fire orders
executed promptly, she seems to have no direct experience
with the violent world outside her offices, that is, not until she
is teamed up with Lt. Col. Devoe, an intelligence man
attached to Special Forces, who teaches her that violence is
the way to stay #1 in the still-turbulent post-Cold War world.
   In a world dominated by the United States, one in which--
according to Devoe--"the Russians couldn't find snow in the
winter," the Americans would be sadly mistaken to feel smug. 
The U.S. won the Cold War but there are sinister forces at
work which continue to make this a parlous world.  Countries
like Iran, Iraq, and Libya may dream of waging chemical and
biological warfare.  The smuggling of still-active nuclear
weapons to hostile governments remains a possibility.  And
individuals with certain personal agendas are determined at
the risk of their own lives to seek vengeance against the
powers they feel are frustrating them.  The initial half of "The
Peacemaker" is the more explosive part, filled with sinister
looking guys speaking strange tongues (but providing English
subtitles) who pull off an exciting raid on a bomb-conveying
train under the literally sleeping noses of its Russian guards
and proceed with their plan to get the firepower over the
Azerbaijani border to Iran.  There is car chase which is as
gripping as it is trite, as Devoe, with passenger Kelly in tow,
deliberately rams his bulletproof Mercedes against the
vehicles in hot pursuit.  But when Devoe and Kelly hunt down
a pair of fanatics in Manhattan who have stolen a single
nuclear device and plan to detonate it inside the U.N. building,
the film becomes an all-too-predictable race against the clock
as the American team must defuse the bomb with minutes to
go.
   Still, Nicole Kidman looks dashing whether doing laps in her
agency's pool or chasing down zealots without mussing her
hair or dirtying her Calvin Klein blouse.  And Clooney has
perfected his shy smile and his tilt of the head so effectively
that when he invites Kidman to share some beers we have no
doubt of her response.  Until the conclusion there is little hint
of a love interest, though there's some playful one-upmanship,
as when Clooney announces to Kidman, "I've just spoken to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff" to which Kidman replies, "I've been
on the phone with the president."  The frantic activity is
directed by Mimi Leder, who proves that a woman at the helm
of an action-adventure film can be as macho as anyone. 
Rated R.  Running Time: 122 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey

     When the collaboration of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and 
David Geffen on a new production company was first announced, it became 
the talk of the entertainment world.  Soon, deals were being signed, 
contracts inked, and films placed into pre-production.  Now, more than 
two years later, Dreamworks SKG is ready to release its first motion 
picture.  Much is riding on the pairing of George Clooney and Nicole 
Kidman in THE PEACEMAKER, a marginal thriller that isn't likely to 
electrify the early Autumn box office.
     What we have here is basically one very long chase movie.  THE 
PEACEMAKER probably would have been a great deal more successful had the 
script been tightened and the running time trimmed.  It's difficult for 
anyone to sustain tension and excitement for over two hours, and the 
task proves too difficult for first-time feature director Mimi Leder.  
The film contains its share of high octane moments (including a car 
chase through the streets of Vienna that turns into a combination of 
high-speed bumper cars and chicken), but there are too many times when 
the proceedings drag.  By the time THE PEACEMAKER reaches its long-
overdue climax in the streets of New York, we just want things to wrap 
up.
     THE PEACEMAKER has the globe-trotting approach of a James Bond 
film, although no one is going to mistake the straightforward, 
sometimes-crass approach of George Clooney's Colonel Thomas Devoe for 
the suave style of 007.  Nevertheless, Leder keeps the film moving from 
place-to-place, taking in such sites as Sarajevo, the Ural Mountains, 
Vienna, Turkey, and, of course, the United States.  The paper-thin plot 
has high-ranking assistant-to-the-President Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole 
Kidman) and Devoe on the trail of a group of Russian terrorists who have 
stolen nine nuclear warheads and appear willing to sell them to the 
highest bidder (the price tag is somewhere around $200 million).  The 
most dangerous potential buyer is a Serb/Croat (he identifies himself as 
both) named Duson (Marcel Iures), who blames the West for the slaughter 
in his country and wants to use a bomb to exact payment in blood.  For 
most of the film, Kelly and Devoe are running around trying to stop 
someone from blowing up one of the weapons. 
     Nicole Kidman has a pretty thankless job here.  She's supposed to 
be playing a tough, intelligent, aggressive go-getter, but she spends 
most of her time in the background while George Clooney mugs for the 
camera or engages in heroics.  Clooney's a pleasant enough actor, and he 
fares much better here than in BATMAN AND ROBIN, but it seems to me that 
he's more suited to lighter material than this.  ONE FINE DAY wasn't a 
great movie, but it contained Clooney's best feature performance to 
date.  As an action star, Clooney isn't likely to challenge the likes of 
Schwarzenegger or Connery (then again, he can act circles around Steven 
Seagal -- but so can just about anyone). 
     THE PEACEMAKER is a very violent film, with the gore (but not the 
artistry) of something by Tarantino or Scorsese.  There are numerous 
closeups of bloody, shot-up corpses.  Plus, thrown in for good measure, 
there's a train wreck, a missile attack on a helicopter, and a nuclear 
explosion.  The body count in this film is easily among the highest of 
the year, but there's a surprising lack of creativity in the way people 
die.  Those that don't get blown up end up with a bullet in their head.
     The script lets us down significantly on at least two occasions.  
In the first place, a great deal is made about the potential 
ramifications of a certain "international incident" that takes place 
midway through the film.  However, immediately after the action takes 
place, the entire matter is dropped.  I for one would have liked to have 
seen at least some of the political fallout from this event.  Secondly, 
attempts to humanize the villain are ill-advised.  There's not enough 
here to make him a sympathetic individual; as a result, most of these 
scenes come across as filler.  In movies like this, it's usually best to 
have the bad guy be a megalomaniac rather than a figure who could have 
walked out of one of Shakespeare's tragedies.  
     THE PEACEMAKER isn't much better or worse than the average James 
Bond movie, except, of course, that it doesn't have the cars, the 
gadgets, the girls, or Bond himself.  There's a certain appeal to the 
premise, but the execution is uneven.  The movie is likely to keep an 
audience's attention, but it's the kind of film that is quickly 
forgotten.  As the debut feature of a new production company, it isn't 
likely to be an unmitigated failure, but neither will it prove to be a 
stunning financial success.  Despite all the bullets, bodies, and bangs, 
Dreamworks is not off to a flying start.

Je heet Steven Spielberg en je wilt als tussendoortje een leuke 
actiefilm maken. Wat doe je dan? Simpel, je richt de DreamWorks studio 
op, je geeft George Clooney en Nicole Kidman de hoofdrollen, je neemt 
een debuterende regisseuse en je verzint een (redelijk) origineel 
verhaaltje. Als eindresultaat krijg je dan The Peacemaker', een film 
waarbij je van begin tot einde op het puntje van je stoel zit.
De film begint in Rusland, waar een trein vol  nucleaire bommen - die 
onderdeel van een internationale ontwapeningsovereenkomst is - gekaapt 
wordt door Russen. Ook de wapens worden gestolen door Russische 
militairen die van plan zijn ze door te verkopen aan de hoogste bieder. 
Als afleiding laten ze ook nog een 75 kiloton zware bom ontploffen. Au.
De Amerikaanse regering komt hier snel achter en stuurt Thomas Devoe 
(George Clooney), een stoere kolonel, en Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), 
een kernspecialiste, erop af. Zij moeten zo snel mogelijk de kernbommen 
onderscheppen, waarvan er nu nog maar elf over zijn. Na lange 
zoektochten lukt het ze om de kernbommen in handen te krijgen. Tien 
kernbommen welteverstaan, want een terrorist gaat er met de elfde 
vandoor. Met als bestemming: New York.
Het is duidelijk dat regisseuse Mimi Leder er geen romantische film van 
wilde maken: The Peacemaker' zit namelijk boordevol actie, het soort
waarbij je met open mond naar het scherm zit te staren. De spannende
autoscčnes in de stijl van James Bond' en de climax in New York zitten
erg goed in elkaar en er is zelfs aan een verhaal gedacht, zodat we in
de film nog op een paar originele ideeën stuiten. Maar daar blijft het
ook bij, want voor de rest is The Peacemaker' een doorsnee actiefilm.
Een leuke doorsnee actiefilm, dat wel.

     Here's an easy short-hand for thinking about THE PEACEMAKER:  it's a
James Bond film without James Bond.  The protagonist, U.S. Army
intelligence officer Col. Tom DeVoe (George Clooney), is a man of action
with contacts around the globe (Armin Mueller-Stahl plays his Russian
Felix Leiter).  His partner is a beautiful and determined woman, nuclear
specialist Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman).  Their adversary is a
nationalist from the former Yugoslavia (Marcel Iures) who has gotten hold
of a nuclear warhead.  Their search for the missing nuke takes DeVoe and
Kelly from Vienna to the Iranian border to New York City.  Okay, so
there's no sex and no vodka martinis, but THE PEACEMAKER comes with
virtually everything else you could ask for in an espionage thriller:
superbly crafted action sequences, a charismatic hero, marvelous
production values, the threat of mass destruction, humor and style.  At
times, it's as satisfying an action film as 1997 has produced to date.
     That's bound to come as a surprise considering the folks both behind
and in front of the camera.  THE PEACEMAKER marks the feature directing
debut of Mimi Leder (previously on duty as a director for "ER",
including the Emmy-nominated "Love's Labor Lost" episode), but she
shows no signs of rookie jitters.  Her sense of timing an action scene,
ably assisted by editor David Rosenbloom, creates tension in unlikely
places; her instinct for effective restraint (like the positively
heretical decision to show two trains hurtling towards one another, then
cut away before the collision) is uncommon and welcome.  Leder instantly
distinguishes herself as a big-screen action director to watch for.
     George Clooney, meanwhile, has previously distinguished himself on
the big screen largely by not distinguishing himself, disappearing into
the frenetic horror of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and the inane vortex that was
BATMAN & ROBIN.  In THE PEACEMAKER, he's a roguish hero with an edge.
DeVoe displays an often ruthless military pragmatism, yet his very refusal
to play politics gives many of his comic lines their bite.  He's an
international enforcer as Sean Connery used to play it:  with a twinkle in
his eye and a hand at your throat.
     He's no Bond, of course, which points out the one glaring deficiency
keeping THE PEACEMAKER from being a great action film.  The Bond films'
awareness of their own high-flying absurdity forced them to avoid
self-importance, while also making it easy for viewers to overlook
mediocre scripts.  Not only is Michael Schiffer's screenplay for THE
PEACEMAKER too serious by half, it feels only half-finished.  Instead of
an arrogantly megalomaniacal villain, or even an appealingly insane one,
Schiffer offers a somber, haunted Bosnian surrounded by the somber,
haunted ruins of Sarajevo.  Leder adds a touch of irony with a passing
shot of Sarajevo's Olympic rings, at least momentarily defusing the
impression that THE PEACEMAKER is trying to Make a Political Statement.
As for the characters...let's just call them functional.  There's a
mechanical feel to the narrative flow of THE PEACEMAKER; it moves from
place to place or person to person with little connective tissue to hold
it all together.  It's an action machine, albeit an extremely well-oiled
one.
     Well-oiled action machines are rare enough that THE PEACEMAKER could
find a receptive audience, perhaps the same audience anxiously awaiting
James Bond's next adventure.  Operating without a compelling script or the
built-in goodwill which accompanies the planet's most famous secret agent,
Mimi Leder and company manage to create a worthy challenger.  With
competition like Bond, it's impressive that Leder was neither shaken nor
stirred.

**1/2 (out of 4) George Clooney was the best movie Batman yet. Val
Kilmer was flat and brooding and Michael Keaton was too much of a wimp.
Clooney brought the right mix of sophistication and wisdom. Not being a
fan of ER, I attributed his success to good acting. 
Now that I've seen him play the same character in ONE FINE DAY, ER, and
now THE PEACEMAKER, I see that he's one of the worst actors to make it
big, good looks aside. He's the next Arnold Schwarzenegger - icon, not
actor. 
THE PEACEMAKER is a very conventional action movie. All the baroque
trim, all the flourishes, have been removed. There is no love interest,
there are no wisecracks, just stripped down, economy model action movie.
This was no doubt Leder's point, and it was a good idea, but it didn't
work. 
The effect was that the movie felt, well, plain. It felt like a quickly
made, no-time-for-details, made-for-TV movie (not surprising considering
Leder's strong TV background). It didn't shun enough of the action genre
to really set itself apart. 
After an opening sequence of Russians stealing a packet of nukes, the
movie introduces Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), a special investigator
whose job it is to find out what happened to them. Assigned to assist
her is Tom Devoe (Clooney), a military liaison with strong Russian
connections. 
They track the nukes through Vienna, where Clooney is tailed by a crew
of disposable bad guys in identical cars. The ensuing chase scene is
very well handled; it looks great on screen. But the endless
destruction, first without any airbags deploying, and second without any
apparent moral or legal consequence, shows that Leder and screenwriter
Michael Schiffer really didn't leave the action genre as far behind as
one might think. 
Kelly and Devoe eventually recover all but one of the stolen nukes. They
track this last one to Bosnia, where they learn that Gavrich (Marcel
Iures) a Bosnian politician disgusted with the West's lack of aid in
their war, intends to detonate a single nuke at the U.N. building in New
York.  
The movie crosses the Atlantic to Manhattan, where another good-looking,
but rather conventional chase scene happens. The movie's climax involves
what Roger Ebert calls RDRs - red digital readouts - counting down to
the destruction of New York. 
Can Kelly and Devoe stop the bomb in time? Well - yes and no. But even
that enigmatic conclusion isn't enough to set this movie apart. 
It would be interesting to see a truly genre-breaking action movie that
doesn't just shun the superficial elements (like love interests and
wisecracks), but questioned the very idea of using violence to combat
violence as the morally Right thing to do.

Starring: 
George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Marcel Iures,
Alexander Baluev, and Rene Medvesek
Ingredients: roguish man, scientific woman, car chase, military raid,
helicopter attack, bomb defusing scene
Synopsis:
A distraught Bosnian piano teacher named Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures),
has purchased nuclear weapons, but high ranking government scientist Dr.
Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) is on to his scheme. Kelly reasons that
since 44-E was written on an invoice from a German truck renter in
Vienna, and Bosnia is on the 44th parallel, and the United Nations is in
New York on 44th Street, it must all be part of a plot to blow up New
York City. Assisting her in finding and stopping the bomber is Colonel
Tom DeVoe (George Clooney), a rule-bending gung ho military man who
enjoys patronizing Dr. Kelly. Soon people are busy barking radio orders
to helicopters, police, and government soldiers while worried officials
swirl around ready rooms strategizing over big logistics charts. It's
all great fun, and as with all movies about bombs, The Peacemaker'
concludes with the obligatory big digital readout scene where the heroes
anguish over how best to disable the explosive device as it counts down
the time.
The Peacemaker' is the highly anticipated first motion picture release
of Dreamworks SKG (the movie-making alliance of  Steven Spielberg,
Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen).
Opinion: 
In search of the piano teacher, DeVoe and Kelly methodically check out
different parts of the world, but never once does it seem that one clue
will lead to another, or that the piano teacher will do anything other
than run, which means there's not a lot of suspense. However, most of
the scenes look busy, with lots of orders being barked and underlings
running frantically. This is enough to fill in the gaps between the more
exciting car chases and other action sequences. Although the acting is
okay (Clooney with his charming smirk and head tilt, Kidman as a nervous
but in-control gal), it is definitely downplayed as the movie is
primarily an action formula.

*** (out of 4)
Directed by Mimi Leder
Starring George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Armin-Mueller Stahl, Michael 
Lures, Randall Batinkoff, Michael Boatman
Mimi Leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of 
the hit tv-show ER. Her mast famous episode, "Love's Labour Lost", dealt 
with the ordeal of Doctor Mark Greene as he tried his best to save the 
life of a pregnant mother and her child. The way she moved the camera and 
created tension throughout every scene was amazing. There was more 
excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of 
Hollywood's big blockbuster movies. So it's only natural that Leder would 
get to direct her very own Hollywood blockbuster. And I have to say, 
after a shaky beginning, she does not disappoint.
Peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists, which 
is obviously nothing new. The first half hour goes into detail, way too 
much detail, about how the weapons are stolen. Despite a few good images, 
including a train collision and a very impressive explosion, none of this 
was very coherent. It's long and drawn out, and I would have settled with 
a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better.
Once George Clooney and Nicole Kidman enter the picture, it begins to 
take off. George Clooney is an Air Force colonel with connections all 
over the world. He has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you 
expect from most Clooney characters. Nicole Kidman is head of a White 
House team on weapons smuggling. There is the usual flirtatious banter 
between the two, but that is dispensed with quickly.
The story takes Clooney and Kidman across the globe, trying to figure out 
who has the weapons and where they are going with them.Clooney goes 
through bouts of sarcasm, frustration, determination, and revenge while 
Kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt. This is when 
Leder starts to show her true stuff. She starts us off with a nifty 
little car chase as an appetizer. Then we get Clooney doing heroics in 
and out of a helicopter. Then that leads us to the brilliant final 
showdown on New York City's crowded streets, and a madman with a nuke 
walking among them.
Mimi Leder is a natural at creating suspense. She reminds me of Wolfgang 
Petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences 
exciting and breathtaking. Nicole Kidman is an intelligent female action 
hero. You're not gonna find her falling down so Clooney can come back to 
save her. George Clooney is a real movie star. Many of you may have hated 
him as Batman, but this guy is for real. He has a natural screen presence,
 and an ingratiating personality. He'll be around for a while. Dreamworks 
is off to a satisfying start with Peacemaker.

Although it's another action flick, this film will be looked at more
closely than others. Why? Because it's the first film from Steven
Spielbergs new production company, Dreamworks SKG. Hopefully, not all
their films will be like this one.  A nuclear missile has been
'stolen' by a terrorist group, and it's up to Clooney and Kidman to
stop the nutty terroists from setting it off in New York. It basically
involves them running around exotic locations, tracking down the
terrorists. There's some good action sequences in there, but this film
is decidely average.
The film is directed OK, and there are a few good scenes (including
one with a car hanging over a cliff) But there's nothing startingly
orinigal about it. The plot is hardly orinignal or exciting, which is
not a good start for a new studio. It's also hard to see why this film
cost $50 million to produce, as the special effects are nothing
special.
The performances are OK, with Clooney giving us the Clooney grin
throughout, and Kidman looking lovely, but not being able to work with
a strong character. The bad guy, however, is excellent. He's not an
outright nutter, such as Daefoe in Speed 2, but a normal, calm, and
disturbed nutter, who believes what he is doing is right. He's very
good. The direction (from a director previously from T.V's ER) is
fine, and there are some striking scenes (but not much)
Dosen't look too good, then, for Dreamworks so far. What they've
delivered is a sub-standard film, which will be forgotten as soon as
it's finished it's video release.  It's a shame really, this could of
been an potential Raiders of the Lost Ark. But with a dull plot,
standard acting, and average action scenes, and a rather large budget,
it's all a bit of a letdown for Spielbergs new studio. Maybe if he had
some creative input into it, it would of been better. Overall, then,
disappointing.

           Disappointment #2. Well not so much a dissappointment,
everyone I'd talked to before hand regarding this movie
had made it clear that this was nothing special. But I still was
hoping to be pleasantly surprised by 'The Peacemaker' which truth be
known was actually made over a year ago but only released recently.
Not to be though. Ordinary is the word that pops to mind when I think
of this film. Plain ordinary. 
               The acting is not really worth focusing on much because
the two lead characters were so weak and undeveloped.
The audience feels no real attachment to Kidman or Clooney's character
(particularly Clooney's brain-dead Colonel Thomas Devoe) and the two
emotional sequences between the two fizzle badly and seem like carbon
copies of each other. The villian was actually not too bad, the
writers opted for a little extra originality here by making him an
ordinary man with very little fighting skills.
               What saves this movie from being an outright stinker is
a couple of nifty action  sequences that kept the audience involved to
a certain degree. The first of these is at the start of the film which
involves two trains and some nice camera work. This scene is
practically given away in the previews for the movie but is fresh
enough so that it sets up a nice tense atmosphere. The special effects
for the resulting nuclear explosion  that closes the scene is fairly
budget, but doesn't looks so cheesy that it ruins the scene.
               The best scene is really no contest and appears about
two thirds into the film. A trio of helicopters penetrates
Russian airspace in an attempt to halt a truck carrying some very
dangerous cargo before it can cross the border into Iran. This scene
is a real show stopper from start to finish and really grabbed my
attention after my mind was starting to drift from the dull and
somewhat idiotic earlier parts.
               The climax sequence in the streets of New York City is
pretty well done and does put you on the edge of your seat
 to a certain degree when everyone is madly searching for a bomber.
This however leads to a fairly dull and predictable confrontation
scene that we've all seen before many many times. 
               Now onto the 'idiotic earlier parts' I mentioned above.
What I am referring to here is a lengthy sequence that occurs
 around 40 minutes into the film. This involves Kidman and Clooney
'interrogating' a trucking executive in his own office and then their
following escape. This part was so dumb it defies description.
Seriously. Suspension of disbelief, once again, only stretches so far.
Devoe's actions in this series of events are simply S T U P I D.
Unfortunately stupidity is a common thread throughout The Peacemaker.
               The Peacemaker failed at the box office and it's not
hard to see why. It's a long time since I've seen weaker
chemistry between male and female leads. The movie's saving grace is
some exciting action sequences that draw the auidence back in and
that's the only way it got 2.5/5 stars in my book. See it if you feel
you can survive till the 1 1/4 hour mark when things start to pick up.

There comes a point in any critic's life when he is watching a movie and
finds himself naming people from the cast and crew from their habits. At
that point, they realize that they have seen way too many movies and are
quickly losing all that's left of their minds. Myself, I reached that point
during the peacemaker when I realized who had done the music to it without
even looking at the credits (Hans Zimmer of "The Rock" and "Crimson Tide").
That was the high point of that movie.
The Peacemaker is a film about terrorism, about a psycho with a bomb with an
intent to blow up Manhattan (woulda done the world some good). Where have we
seen this one before? George Clooney of "ER" and "From Dusk 'till Dawn" is
the star power of this movie, acting opposite to Nicole Kidman, and the
roles they play are so stereotypical that its insane. Clooney plays the
good-guy rambo type bent on saving the world (with the modern twist of
actually having a brain beneath that thick skull) and Kidman plays the woman
who is just trying to save the world while salvaging her latest failed
romance. Be still my lunch.
The film does have its good points, the action scenes are well done (which
comprise most of the movie) but they have the tendency to drag on a little
longer than necessary. Again another try at getting a good movie. Again
another failure. Rent it on a rainy day.

Overall evaluation: good enough way to spend a Friday evening
As you probably know, _The Peacemaker_ is about Nicole Kidman and George
Clooney running around the world trying to stop a nuclear terrorist from
blowing up the UN.   Much of the film, though well executed, is cliche
within its genre.  
For instance: many of the scences, espeically with the bad guys, are
filmed "darkly"; the Church in the beginning, the Russian missle storage
area, and the train ride are all filmed with only a minimal light in the
foreground, and dark shinyness in the background.  Of course this is
nothing really new; just the methods which the cinematographer does it in. 
Just like in _Face Off_. Just like in _The Rock_.  Just like in _Crimson
Tide_.  The sun shines brightly whenever the hero and heroine are around
trying to stop the baddies; and the camera picks it up beautifully. 
Audiowise, the bolt and slide action, as well as the safety fumbling of
the character's firearms are quite prominently recorded.  I suppose the
idea is that audieces get scared when they hear things like that they'll
instinctivley start to tremble.  (No, the producers are not trying to be
realistic.  No one can so perfectly manipulate firearms parts;  those
sounds should be pretty quiet; and the actual shot should be literally
deafening in a movie theater). 
The music sounds like a rehash of _Crimson Tide_.  Much of it uses the
same instruments with a similar progression of notes to the previous
picture (though it is much more authorative in the older movie).  _The
Peacemaker_ even uses a soupy men's chorus to create dramatic tension
(again, same as in the older picture, which uses a soupy playing of 
Navy's hymn "Eternal Father" to make a sub dive look impressive).  
Now it may seem that the things I've babbled about above are
supreficialities. But they really are not; the way the picture is filmed,
the way the audio mixed, the way the music put out, are all the primarly
means by which audience feelings and suchforth are manipulated.  Any good
film will play around with those elements well. 
more cliches:
The Russians call each other "tovarish" or comrade (AFAIK, that went out,
even in the Army, after the the Soviet Union fell).  
The bad guys have their own private "professional special forces/SWAT
team" (goons with night vision goggles, "tactical black BDUs", MP5SDs and
laser sights :P )  to commit important acts of terrorism with. 
Everywhere the main characters go, especially their command centers, are
crawling with people rushing saying all sorts of things frantically.
The scriptwriters use lots of fake CNN reports to explain what's going on.
However, despite the fact that I got a sensation of "deja vu" when I saw
the picture, it isn't really a _bad_ film.  The lead characters are OK;
they pretended they knew what they were talking about/doing reasonably
well.  The scenes were reasonably exciting.  All in all, a good popcorn
movie.

 This anticipated inaugural film by the newly created Dreamworks SKG
 production company is not a tremendous offering given the hype that
 has preceded its release.  However, it accomplishes three improbable
 but ultimately satisfying things.  It re-energizes the somewhat
 stalled career of leading lady Nicole Kidman.  It gives George
 Clooney, that medical hearthrob from television's ER, a chance to
 really flex his cinematic muscles.  And, it refreshes an increasingly
 stale plotline of stolen nuclear weapons and America as the target.
 As the crisis unfolds, we are introduced to Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole
 Kidman). As the acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling
 Group, she is the expert that's leading the investigation and the
 operation of recovering the stolen nuclear warheads.  With a PhD from
 Harvard under her belt, she is adamant about following rules and
 protocols, and is the perennial cautious planner that builds in
 contingencies for everything.  As she briefs the top brass on the
 intelligence that has been gathered so far, she is constantly
 interrupted by Thomas Devoe (George Clooney).  He is an intelligence
 officer with the U.S. Army's special forces who believes profiteers
 will sell these weapons to rogue governments.  Not the typical
 soldier, he is brash, bends rules, and takes great liberties to get
 what he wants including heavy bribes and savage in-your-face beatings.
 However, when it comes to things military, he is smart, clever, and a
 man of action.  He gets to the point and on people's nerves
 too...especially those of Dr. Kelly's.
 It doesn't take a degree in nuclear physics to figure out that these
 two are eventually paired up by the powers that be to save the world.
 But fortunately, the writers are able to give us two likable
 characters that can overcome the cliches of hardened Russians,
 sophisticated spy satellites, and bombs with digital readouts.  The
 two work in unison to overcome their distaste for one another's
 personality and skillfully negotiate their way towards the location of
 the warheads.  But as with all bombs with digital readouts, the
 audience knows that time is running out for the heroes.
 The Peacemaker, which was filmed in various locales around the world,
 evokes the look and feel of Tom Clancy's books-turned-movies.  A
 strong score helps to elevate the unfolding drama and the tension is
 constant throughout.  Clooney is perfectly cast as the virtuous and
 honorable military fighter.  He is macho.  He is action-hungry.  He is
 GI Joe.   Kidman also provides good balance as they race to save the
 world.  But despite the slick look of the movie and the constant level
 of excitement that is generated by the chase scenes, you'll come out
 with the feeling that most of what you saw was done in dozens of
 action movies in the recent past.  Also, at times the movie seems
 overly complicated as if simply adding more events and chases would
 somehow add to the film's weight.  Still, this kind of entertainment
 is scarce during the autumn, and you'll still be able to make peace
 with yourself for seeing it.

Big budget action pics are usually just passed off as "crap," and I
agree that most of them are.  I mean, I don't know about you but I
cringe everytime someone like Seagal or Van Damme puts one out on the
market precisely in that time when there's nothing else good so it will
make it look like the movie-of-the-weekend by comparison.  But in this
surprisingly interesting fall movie season, when there are good films
like "The Game" and "L.A. Confidential" out, as well as a bear movie
written by David Mamet, the obligatory monthly action pic ("The
Peacemaker") actually delivers.  Yes, it's full of cliches, devoid of
characterization or emotion, filled with scenes that have been stolen
from other actions pics that were stolen from other action pics.  And
yes, it ends with the big cliche of the ticking timebomb (yawn).  But
fuck it, it's fun.
"The Peacemaker" combines the usual action pic with touches of Bond and
Clancy to produce a story about two government peoples' search for
stolen nuclear weapons that were missing when a train carrying them
crashed in Russia, setting one of them off (cool scene, by the way). 
Called to duty are: a government chick (no clue what her position is)
played by Nicole Kidman (with brown hair and one of her attempts at an
American accent); and a military colonel or something played by George
Clooney.  The sight of these two on screen for the first time of course
makes us realize how important the marketing was instead of the plot
because they look great together.
But as the story kind of twists and turns, we find out that the boys who
stole the nuclear weapons are being screwed over themselves by three
Bosnian brothers, the unofficial leader of them being a UN diplomat
(Michael Iures) who wants to take one of them to New York and ignite the
UN building in protest of their lack of support for the killings in
Bosnia.  Yeah.  Interesting idea, but we all know how serious this
should be treated.  But at leas they're up to date on current events.
Kidman and Clooney, boasting a kind of retro Hepburn/Tracy relationship,
starting out with her asking for a man who will follow her orders only
to be ordered around by the rule-breaking Clooney for the remainder of
the film, and ending with a potential bit of dating (glad they didn't
have them fool around in between action sequences or something).  The
two of them journey around the world throughout the film, travelling to
Vienna, Russia, etc - getting involved in surprisingly well-executed
action sequences.
Mimi Leder, who has directed "China Beach" and "ER" episodes, makes a
fun-filled first film.  She doesn't waste time, and the film moves
quickly, prohibiting the need to check your watch every couple seconds. 
And her action sequences look excellent and contain a lot of humor.  The
screenplay by Michael Schiffer is nothing special, but it does provide a
lot of funny lines here and there.
And the acting is good too.  George Clooney has made four films in a
year and a half, and he has definitely proved that he's a commanding
presence in front of the Hollywood camera.  In fact, he seems to be so
comfortable nowadays that it almost seems that he's flirting with the
lense.  He has a great sense of humor with his acting, and looks cool as
hell during the action sequences.  He's certainly becoming an
accomplished Hollywood actor.  Don't know if that's a good thing or not,
but nevertheless, it's true.
Kidman gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop, but nevertheless does a good
job.  She shows a tough woman who seems to be striving very hard in some
scenes (so much that her shirt sticks to her body).  And there's those
lovely shots of her in the swimming pool, of course.  Anyway, Kidman's
better than this, but I suppose it's fun to do a crap role like this
every once in a while.
Also, Armin Mueller-Stahl acts in a big budget film for the second time
in one month (the other was "The Game"), and, as he was before, is kind
of wasted seeing that he's a very good actor.  Also look for "Spin
City"'s Michael Boatman in a little part that could have gone to any
actor.
Oh.  And Michael Iures as the lead terrorist is actually very good.  He
looks like a kind of Middle Eastern Jeremy Irons, and has this great
look on his face that shows that he truly has lived in Bosnia.  He looks
absolutely ragged, and I actually felt a bit of sympathy for the guy,
even if he wanted to blow up New York.
Dreamworks first film is not a great film, but it delivers what I
thought it would: present a good, dumb, action pic that's fun to watch. 
And it is.  It's got cliche after cliche, lacks any depth, and has more
plot holes than a Seagal flick (okay, maybe I'm exaggerating here).  But
who cares - it was fun, and I'm gonna go ahead and give it a
non-pretentious thumb up.

Dreamworks SKG / 2:02 / 1997 / R (violence, profanity) 
Cast: George Clooney; Nicole Kidman; Marcel Iures; Gary Werntz; Holt 
McCallany; Rene Medvesek; Alexander Baluev; Michael Boatman; Armin 
Mueller-Stahl 
Director: Mimi Leder 
Screenplay: Michael Schiffer 
Dreamworks SKG, the high-profile collaborative production team of Steven 
Spielberg, Jeffery Katzenberg and David Geffen, gets off on the right 
filmmaking foot with "The Peacemaker." A big, dumb, loud adventure that 
combines enough tawdry foreign intrigue for 14 James Bond flicks with
sparkling star power and enthralling visuals, "The Peacemaker" isn't a 
particularly strong genre entry, but even its weaknesses don't hinder it 
from being an entertaining lark. 
The only big names in the cast belong to the two leads: Current Batman 
George Clooney and ex-Batman flame Nicole Kidman. The latter plays Dr. 
Julia Kelly, a top presidential aid and the acting head of the White 
House's Nuclear Smuggling Group. Kelly becomes embroiled in an
important investigation surrounding the theft of 10 nuclear missiles 
from a speeding train by Russian terrorists. When one is "accidentally" 
set off, an entire Middle Eastern countryside is vaporized. 
Enter Clooney's gung-ho Colonel Thomas Devoe, who fast becomes Kelly's 
unlikely ally as they trot around the globe and try to keep track of the 
missiles throughout various trade-offs and other shifty dealings. It 
turns out that a potential buyer (Marcel Iures) has vengeance on his 
mind and would very much like to use one to annihilate the area 
surrounding our United Nations building, where a treaty is going to be 
signed involving the very governments he holds responsible for the
murder of his wife and child. 
When it devotes its time to action movie dynamics, the movie is a great 
deal of fun. Exhilarating sequences abound -- there's a spectacular 
round of bumper cars between Devoe and the bad guys in Vienna's exotic 
locale, as well as a literal bridge-hanger where he attempts to secure 
some of the remaining nukes. After the faulty send-offs of "Air Force 
One" and "G.I. Jane," it's refreshing to see "The Peacemaker" save some 
of its most riveting moments for its climax -- a suspenseful (if
over-the-top) chase through New York City, culminating in one of the 
most effective explosion-countdowns ever put to film. 
However, if "The Peacemaker" needs a pacemaker, it's in the plot area. 
It's a good thing the heros have engaging demeanors, because Iures' 
villain is about as interesting as burnt toast. The attempts to develop 
a sympathetic character out of him are dull and ordinary, and as a 
result, he's low on personality, a big no-no for this type of film. Also 
disconcerting is "The Peacemaker"'s rather dull setup of events. Only 
when Clooney and Kidman enter the frame does the movie ever become
involving, making the opening segments something of an uncomfortable 
sit. 
Speaking of the performers, they really carry "The Peacemaker" to 
memorable lengths. With a great turn here, Clooney proves he can carry a 
dramatic adventure as well as a horror film ("From Dusk Till Dawn"), a 
comic book adaptation ("Batman & Robin") or a romantic comedy ("One Fine 
Day"). He's a very agreeable actor, and even gets numerous chances to 
crack wise amidst the explosions and mass death. Kidman is also in top 
form and even gets to play a bigger part in the story than expected -- 
she's never quite resorted to a damsel in distress. The most beautiful 
woman working in movies today, Kidman even looks flawless covered in 
sweat and caked in mud. Also of note is Mimi Leder, whose you-are-there, 
Emmy-winning directing prowess on "ER" serves her work here well. Maybe 
filming gurneys and doctors in constant motion is good preparation for 
an action film. 
While "The Peacemaker" fumbles occasionally (more so in its first half), 
it's always diverting and never unwatchable. Almost every movie has its 
flaws, and although "The Peacemaker" is never an exception to that rule, 
it's certainly something special to see a film with enough notable 
merits to outweigh and overpower its drawbacks.

     The first film from Dreamworks SKG-- you know, that studio from
those guys-- is, well, one, long chase scene.  Nicole Kidman and George
Clooney go through the requisite motions as a pair of nuclear weapons
experts, trotting the globe in search of stolen Russian warheads, one of
which ends up in a Bosnian backpack, bound for the Big Apple.  Kidman,
as a brunette (!) and looking all of 23 years old, plays the presiden-
tial adviser who's in charge, while Clooney bobs along as a Special
Forces officer who pretends she isn't.  And while neither delivers the
star performance that's expected, they do have enough chemistry to keep
their scenes interesting.  (Just ignore their idiotic repartee at the
outset.  Once people begin to die around them, they shut up and get ser-
ious.  And, believe it or not, actually grieve.)
     More importantly, both are able to stay in step with director Mimi
Leder's relentlessly brisk pacing.  This is a movie that *moves*, man,
and isn't afraid to sacrifice such trivialities as character develop-
ment, plot complexity, or humor.  (The grim business of counter-terror-
ism is periodically lightened-- a "Baywatch" joke here, an American
Online gag there.)  At least the action is terrific.  Four superbly
staged sequences are the real reasons to plop down $6.50:  the nighttime
hijacking of a moving choo choo, a car chase/demolition derby/Mercedes
Benz product plug, a helicopter attack on a truckload of bad guys, and,
the grand finale, where every available agency converges on a handful of
Manhattan city blocks during rush hour.  It's chaos of the finest order,
marred only by a Dreaded Flashback to the villain's past.  And, of
course, the LOL realization that the bomb's ten-minute timer has been
ticking for, oh, at least twenty minutes.  Heh.

After watching too many movies where the bad guys are the Russians, the
Chinese, the entire Eastern block and now the Bosnians, AND the good
guys are none other than the Americans (once again), I badly need to see
a movie where the American's lose big time. And I think the most likely
place to find the product of such a fantasy would most likely be in Iraq
i.e. Hussein productions. Not that I have anything against the Americans
winning all the time, but I'm in great need of a different perspective
on life.
Once again in this movie 'The Peacemaker' the safety of the United
States is once again under threat by some very angry Bosnians who blame
the US and the UN for their problems. This brings to mind that too often
repeated statement by Nicole Kidman - "I'm not afraid of the man who has
ten nuclear warheads, I'm afraid of the one who only wants one." My
trite reply to this is - "Give me ten nuclear warheads and I'll show you
who to be afraid of." I'm a peaceable, easy going kind of a guy, but in
this movie I had this incredible urge to want to see the terrorist
succeed. Of course I wouldn't want anyone injured, but I felt the dire
urge for the bomb to go off, and with it that grand delusion that the
United States is the greatest nation on this earth.
Of course I've seen New York, Washington and Dallas enveloped in flames
i.e. "Independence Day", but that doesn't really count. When the world
is under threat from big bad aliens, of course I'm going to side with
the Americans. So this new movie from SKG productions aims at the heart
of the great nation, drawing on the wild card of patriotism and a threat
to the people. It's a safe tactic to play when the plot and script isn't
solid engrossing material. The SKG team has decided on the leading man
for the moment (George Clooney) to help boost this movie's popularity
and banked on an actress who is both attractive and a constant solid
performer (Nicole Kidman). However, this does not save "The Peacemaker"
from its otherwise very ordinary make. The ending gets as improbable as
Nicole Kidman dismantling a nuclear device with a pen knife in 2.5
minutes; which is more ludicrous than an American President kicking butt
on a hijacked plane if you ask me.

The Peacemaker arrives on screens under considerably more scrutiny than
an average late-September action release.  First of all, it's the
inaugural motion picture release from Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, and David Geffen's studio, DreamWorks SKG, launched with much
fanfare three years ago.  The second concern is one that was not foreseen
at the time of the film's production: the questionable box office
bankability of lead George Clooney, whose popularity on television's ER
has not translated into blockbuster box office grosses for From Dusk till
Dawn, the underrated One Fine Day, and the justly maligned stinkbomb
Batman & Robin.  So does this Tom Clancy-esque thriller deliver the goods
under pressure?  Yes--it's certainly exciting enough to leave audiences
sufficiently entertained for a couple of hours, but that's all.
But what can you expect when the basic plot of Michael Schiffer's
screenplay (based on, as the credits read, "an article by Andrew and
Leslie Cockburn") is as thin as they come (OK, maybe not as thin as
Twister's)?  A cache of nuclear warheads is stolen from a train in
Russia, and it's up to Special Forces intelligence officer Col. Thomas
Devoe (Clooney) and the head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group,
Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) to recover them, setting up one big
globe-hopping chase after the weapons and the terrorists who stole 
them.
Schiffer and director Mimi Leder don't take this story in any new
directions; familiar action staples such as car and helicopter chase
sequences, running through crowded streets, big explosions, and (would a
bomb thriller be complete without one?) a
hurry-the-hell-up-and-disarm-the-bomb-before-we-all-blow-up-to-kingdom-come
scene are present here.  And some touches cannot help but remind one of
some of the cast and crew's previous credits: Leder's extensive steadicam
use recalls her ER work; a prolonged piano-playing scene, complete with
closeups of fingers on keys, reminds one of co-star Armin Mueller-Stahl's
Shine; and Devoe and Kelly encounter a character named--gag--Schumacher. 
But Leder directs it all with a fairly quick pace and high energy level,
most notably in the opening hijack scene and a rousing car
chase/demolition derby in the streets of Vienna.
Similarly energized is Clooney, who fits this role much more snugly than
his infamous last.  His self-effacing manner feels more at home here than
it did for the Caped Crusader, but this is not to say that he's smiley
and jokey all of the time.  When called on to do action hero derring-do,
he's up to the task, making good on the largely forgotten "serious
action" promise he displayed in Dusk.  Thankfully, no contrived romantic
angle is developed between Devoe and Kelly, but that's even more for the
better here since little spark of any kind develops between Clooney and
Kidman, who seems a little ill-at-ease here.  Granted, she isn't given
anything really strenuous to do here (unless you count swimming laps),
but something is clearly, oddly amiss when her usually flawless American
accent slips into her natural Aussie every now and again.
With little competition in the action arena right now, the solidly made
The Peacemaker should keep Clooney's film career afloat (for now, at
least) and get DreamWorks Pictures off on a successful start--but the
film still can't help but feel like somewhat of a letdown.  It is a
sturdy, entertaining popcorn movie, and while that may be good enough for
any other studio at any other time, as the maiden film voyage of S, K,
and G's much-hyped zillion-dollar enterprise, it's a dismayingly
nondescript piece of formula product.

The Peacemaker is going to be scrutinized because of it being the first
release out of the much-touted DreamWorks SKG production company. Can
director Mimi Leder ("ER") and acting dual George Clooney and Nicole Kidman
make this be a great debut film for DreamWorks SKG?
It's interesting to note that four big players from the hit TV show "ER"
are part of The Peacemaker production: Award winning director Mimi Leder,
executive producer John Wells, actor George Clooney, and executive producer
Steven Spielberg. With these big names attached to the film, it has to be
good, right?
A group of terrorists steal ten nuclear warheads and create an incident
with one of the warheads. Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) is the head of
the group that is looking into this incident. She requests the assistance
of someone with a specialty in this field, and that someone is Tom Devoe
(George Clooney). He's a specialist in dealing with terrorism of this type
and at also dealing with illegal arms dealers. Together, Kelly and Devoe go
hunting for the rest of the nuclear warheads. Added to this is the
political plot of a "Serbian, Bosnian, and Muslim" man, who in the script
is attempted to be humanized with a sub-plot about his family being killed
off by terrorist.
What is strange is that the opening incident is dropped quickly after its
purpose is found out. I would have really liked to see what could or would
have been done to correct that incident, but it is dropped quickly to let
the action start. Which, in the case of The Peacemaker looks like a good
thing to have done, but it would have been interesting to see what could
have happened.
The best way to describe The Peacemaker is a two-hour chase scene.
Peacemaker has locations in Italy, Bosnia, Russia and the US. The world
travel is handled well. Each site has one action scene attached to it. I
especially love the car chase in Venice that plays like grown men in bumper
cars. Most of the action, though well done, is hardly imaginative and very
uninspired. The car chase is about as creative as the action scenes get.
The opening action sequence seems to take too long for what it is meant to
show. There is also the unnecessary gore that is used throughout the film.
Mimi Leder shows that she knows how to use the camera effectively.
Sometimes too effective and making some of the camera work unneeded and
distracting. Some of her shots that use the camera in motion are just for
the hell of it, and it is more distracting that anything. About halfway
through the film, you get the sense, even if you didn't know that Leder was
a director on ER, from her camera work that she is an ER director. The
constant fluid motion of the camera is a constant reminder of the camera
work in ER. Whereas in ER the camera fluidly follows a gurney or fluidly
does a 360 around a gurney, here in The Peacemaker the camera fluidly
follows another object or fluidly does a 360 around a character. 
The performances in The Peacemaker are nothing special. Kidman does OK as
Kelly. In one scene where she cries over the loss of nine soldiers, she
sheds a tear, gets up, and makes a call about a different matter. So quick,
so fast, and so brief was her cry that we don't really get the sense that
she really cared about those soldiers. Clooney does his usual character
role. Lost are his nervous ticks from ER which makes him look more
confident, but, he's not doing anything new here. His character is
likeable, but we don't really get to know his character enough to care for
him.
Hans Zimmer does the score for this film, and this is the best thing about
the film. The score is pulse pounding and follows the action well.
The Peacemaker is an average action film that has its thrilling moments.
Though the film is a bit on the long side, it does keep a good pace. I
recommend seeing The Peacemaker, but only during a matinee showing. I hope
that Dreamworks SKG has better films lined up to release after this mildly
entertaining and easily forgettable debut.

The Peacemaker.  Such an ironic title for the subject matter tackled
in the film.  Perhaps that is the point... maybe that is one of the
themes the film uses.  Supposedly, the peacemakers of this movie are
the U.S. and U.K.'s governments.  But do those peacemakers cause more
carnage and bloodshed than the actual terrorists?  Well, upon
witnessing The Peacemaker, I would say no, but there is so much
mean-spiritedness behind the premise and conclusion that maybe we
aren't quite as peaceful as we would like to think.  Then again, the
novel probably handled these subjects very well because of the length
and detail a book can entail.  But this film, while running over two
hours in length, tries to shove all these themes down your throat
during its run, and instead of coming out as a thought-provoking
action film, it comes out as a jumbled, messy, but costly action
movie.
Beware of the ads for The Peacemaker.  They carry the one biggest
slogan which gets a lot of viewers in the seats, but also misinforms
the viewer.  "Based on the #1 Best Selling Novel!"  If you don't know,
this means that the book was a hit among readers.  Unfortunately, it
doesn't reveal what critics thought, nor how the movie version might
come out.  The Peacemaker is one of those films which tries hard to be
good, but then tries a little too hard.  The pace of this film is so
uneven that you may find yourself dozing off in some moments, while
easily enthralled in others.  Not many films can do this, and so it's
interesting to see one.  Fortunately, there are several elements of
The Peacemaker which can cause most viewers to stay awake, including a
couple of intense action pieces, as well as an intriguing prologue.
To sum up The Peacemaker in one sentence is easy: A bigger and louder
cat-and-mouse game.  The Game was another cat-and-mouse film, but
while the latter had visuals and an interesting story to draw in
viewers, the former has to rely on star power and action.  Star power
is one of the high points, with the exception of one major player.
The film begins with an exciting and entertaining action scene (as
most action films do), which involves a group of Russian military men
transporting ten nuclear warheads to sell to the government.  A simple
plan, until a mysterious train approaches the transport.  Aboard this
second train is a militia out to get back at the so-called
"peacemakers."  They hijack nine of the ten warheads, killing everyone
aboard, and then sending the train, with an armed warhead, on its way
to collide with a train carrying over 1500 people.  As you can
imagine, the film gets off with a bang (literally), but then slows to
a crawl, and almost to a stop.
I must admit that I was shocked at the overall mean-spiritedness,
especially coming from Dreamworks, the new production company of
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen.  Much of The
Peacemaker consists of Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) and Colonel
Devoe (George Clooney) running around trying to find the missing
warheads.  If done correctly, this sort of story can create a lot of
tension.  Director Mimi Leder, unfortunately, didn't find the right
tone for the film.  The screenplay by Michael Schiffer has many flaws
in it, including the humanization of villain Duson (Marcel Iures).  In
Cliffhanger, John Lithgow was a ruthless killer who would do anything
to get his money.  Duson, however, supposedly has a good side to his
persona, and many of these scenes are laughably bad.  We don't really
care if Duson lives or dies, mostly a result of the decision to give
him another side to his evil personality.  Instead of hating him and
hoping that Devoe kills him, we almost begin to wish both would die.
Kelly, on the other hand, is a very good character, though
underdeveloped to make room for Devoe.  Kidman has a very nice
presence on screen, and saves many of her films.  While she wasn't
able to save The Peacemaker, she provided some nice contrast to the
inhuman Clooney.  And as for Clooney, well, he still can't act.
Arguably the only reason to put him into the film is to draw female
viewers, but Clooney never really plays a character.  He plays Clooney
portraying a character.  The supporting cast fares much better.  Armin
Mueller-Stahl, as always, is terrific in his short role.  Iures, while
given many unnecessary scenes, has a certain look which gives those
unnecessary scenes a little depth.  While showing a good side, his
face portrays evil.  Kidman's scenes, however, are the best among the
film, especially where she cries over the loss of nine dead soldiers.
Her discussion with Clooney about nuclear warheads and their
possessors is cliched, but because of Kidman's graceful appearance,
the scene comes out haunting and thoughtful.
The main theme of The Peacemaker, if there is one, is whether or not
the peacemakers are as evil as the villains themselves.  In one scene,
Clooney and Kidman order a soldier to shoot Duson.  However, the
soldier keeps telling them that a little kid's head is in the way.
Nevertheless, they still tell him to take the shot.  Not only was I
shocked, but I realized that this one command contradicts the ethical
background of our government.  Perhaps this scene was supposed to draw
fear from viewers, but instead I wished that Duson would succeed and
nuke the city.  Maybe we aren't as peaceful as we would like to
believe.  However, many of the action scenes are exciting and not as
disturbing.  The chase through Venice is well done and actually quite
tense.  In Roger Ebert's review of Breakdown, he commented that when
Kathleen Quinlan finished off the villain, he was appalled that she
would do that to an unarmed man.  I had the same reaction during this
chase sequence when Clooney shoots one of the villains as he is dying
in the passenger seat.  So much for keeping the peace.
The Peacemaker is rated R for bloody and graphic violence, along with
a high body count.  No sex or nudity is present, and amazingly Kidman
and Clooney show no signs of romance on screen, with the exception of
the ending.  There is language, but the violence pretty much acquires
the R rating.  For her first time directing, Mimi Leder does an
amateurish job.  And for the Dreamworks' first feature film, I surely
hope they will do better next time.  Easily the most heartless film of
the year, The Peacemaker will most likely be forgotten during the rush
of Oscar-worthy films coming up in the next few months.
