      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   It's not too difficult to like Michael Moore, creator of the highly
   successful documentary ROGER & ME who returns with his
   similarly-themed follow-up, THE BIG ONE.  His intrinsic appeal to his
   many fans is fairly obvious -- he's the proverbial fly in the
   ointment to corporate America, the underdog crusader challenging and
   confronting big business on behalf of the downtrodden working class.
   It's easy to garnish the audience's support in an Us vs. Them
   polemic, particularly when Mr. Moore labels the Them as the powerful,
   faceless downsizing corporations across America, while the Us is
   depicted as the sad, desperate faces of the newly-unemployed; when
   forced to choose to empathise with either the wealthy industry bigwig
   or the struggling factory worker with bills to pay and hungry mouths
   to feed, it's far too easy to recognize ourselves in the latter.
   Mr. Moore himself does a good job as coming across as an Everyman,
   with his portly, cheerful, insidiously mischievous demeanor, his
   infectious grin, his omnipresent baseball cap, and his propensity not
   to take himself too seriously.  One can immediately tell, however,
   that he takes the topic of downsizing very seriously, and in THE BIG
   ONE, while sent on a whirlwind cross-country tour in 1996 to promote
   his book "Downsize This!  Random Threats From An Unarmed American",
   Mr. Moore and a makeshift skeletal film crew took the opportunity to
   film this irreverent guerrilla documentary on the effects of
   corporate downsizing.  His approach?  In addition to including
   testimonials on the unfairness of the situation from newly-downsized
   workers (corporations are already reaping huge profits, yet are
   nonetheless relocating their plants abroad, where cheaper labour
   abounds), Mr. Moore seemingly-innocously ambled unannounced into
   front foyers of many downsizing corporate headquarters across the
   country and created scenes by demanding justification for the
   layoffs, preferably from a CEO.
   His confrontational approach, though, is decidedly more caustic than
   vitriolic: Mr. Moore typically comes bearing gifts, albeit dubious
   ones -- "Downsizer Of The Year" award certificates, oversized cheques
   for eighty cents ("the first hour's wages for a Mexican worker").
   Bane of corporate America -- one company even issued an internal
   memorandum instructing its staff how to address the situation should
   he pay them an uninvited visit -- Mr. Moore's essentially the working
   man's shit-disturber, ambushing greedy big businesses and holding
   them up for ridicule, all the while remaining eminently polite and
   good-natured; forced out of one office building, he calls out through
   the glass window to the staff member manning the front desk, "You
   tricked me!" in a tone of bemused indignity.
   Although these showdowns are occasionally amusing, they tend do lose
   their bite after repetition as Mr. Moore pulls the same stunt in
   city after city.  Curiously, as the film progressed I found my own
   sympathies lying more and more towards the corporate security guards
   being awkwardly put in the position of attempting to quell his
   instigations; what did these working men ever do to deserve this?
   And Mr. Moore even shows an mean-spirited side in a prank on one of
   the media escorts assigned by his publisher to accompany and assist
   him at his book signings; while she's being forcibly ejected from the
   premises by a security guard misinformed that she's a stalker, the
   person next to me in the theatre choked out "That's so mean!" in
   between her chortles of laughter.  I agreed, although I wasn't
   laughing.  After the joke is finally revealed, we get a close-up of
   the humiliated media escort who's been simply doing her job (she was
   actually fetching Mr. Moore a soda at his bequest when she was
   promptly expelled), grinning and bearing it; behind her gritted
   teeth, you know that deep down she's ready to belt the guy.
   Where THE BIG ONE is at its best is when Mr. Moore interacts with
   other people and unearths surprising and often superficially-shocking
   bits of inanity: he gets a manager of a Payday candy bar plant being
   relocated from Centralia, Illinois to Mexico to state on-camera that
   the move would've been delayed had the employees been *less*
   productive; he finds a convicted murderer who reveals that TWA is
   using low-paid California prison inmates to provide information to
   callers on the airline's 1-800 number.  The mind boggles.
   The film culminates in Seattle, where Mr. Moore is *invited* for a
   one-on-one session with Nike Inc. CEO Phil Knight.  When asked why
   Nike's factories are based in Asia rather than in the U.S., Mr.
   Knight responds "Americans don't really want to make shoes," and
   perhaps he has a point; no amount of low-angle camera shots that Mr.
   Moore employs successfully hides the fact that the group of Flint,
   Michigan hopefuls rallied to convince Nike in setting up a hometown
   shoe factory falls well short of the 500 promised.  In retrospect,
   his pleas for an American-based factory, all the while admitting that
   its margin of profitability would be less than that of a
   foreign-based plant, is disturbing in how much it resembles as a plea
   for charity.  The meeting grows quickly inane after Mr. Knight
   sensibly points out that any unemployed worker sufficiently desperate
   will attest to a desire to work in any sort of profession, upon which
   Mr. Moore challenges the corporate bigwig with a footrace, and then
   an armwrestle for a Flint Nike plant.
   THE BIG ONE is an unabashed pro-labour, pro-union advocacy piece, and
   Mr. Moore's tirades against big industry make for engaging
   soundbites.  Even if one doesn't agree with Mr. Moore's ideologies,
   the film is still entertaining, humorous, and quick-paced.  THE BIG
   ONE weaves in and out of wickedly funny excerpts from Mr. Moore's
   sociopolitical speaking tours monologues (a key target: the
   unblinking Steve Forbes), and savvy editing is employed to elicit
   maximum effect from the many contradictions and absurdities stumbled
   across.  It's an argumentative and provocative film which plays as
   a romp as much as it does a lecture.
   There's a little irony buried within the film which I couldn't help
   but enjoy.  So when anti-big business, pro-union Michael Moore is on
   the road and gets the munchies, where does he get his crew to pull
   over? Why, at McDonald's, of course; gotta have that Filet-O-Fish.

     The first misconception to correct about Michael Moore's THE BIG 
ONE is that it is a documentary.  It's not  Moore doesn't make those.  
As was proven after the release of Moore's debut, ROGER & ME, the 
director uses real people, places, and circumstances, then stages events 
(see Harlan Jacobson's piece in the November/December 1989 FILM COMMENT 
for more details).  Reality  a fragile commodity in any "fact-based" 
motion picture  takes a back seat to what will play well on a movie 
screen.  As a result, it's best to consider Moore's films as entries 
into the ever-growing category of pseudo (or "meta") documentaries.  Or, 
perhaps even more accurately, view it as an exercise in self-publicity.  
     Having said that, however, it's necessary for me to point out that 
Moore is a talented film maker who is capable of putting some very funny 
moments on screen.  And, regardless of what methods were used to produce 
the movie, it still makes an extremely valid point about the way big 
business mistreats its workers, laying off people and transferring 
manufacturing to third-world countries rather than sacrificing a little 
profit.  Having been "downsized" myself, I understand and share Moore's 
anger.  With ROGER & ME and THE BIG ONE, he has become the motion 
picture industry's champion of the "little guy."
     THE BIG ONE is a filmed diary of a book signing tour Moore embarked 
upon to promote his 1997 bestseller, DOWNSIZE THIS!  From St. Louis to 
Milwaukee to Portland, he moves across the country, scrawling his 
autograph on the inside covers of books, visiting corporate headquarters 
in fruitless attempts to see CEOs, and doing bitingly funny standup acts 
at universities and during other public speaking engagements.  Moore's 
theme, italicized through humor, is always the same:  that corporate 
America, in bed with politicians, is raping the common man.  It's all 
about greed.  At various times, he calls the leaders of major companies 
"terrorists" and "murderers."  And he has the evidence to back up the 
charges.
     THE BIG ONE is a hit-and-miss affair.  Some of the episodes 
detailing Moore's repeated failed tries to meet with CEOs (Leaf, Johnson 
Controls, Pillsbury, and Proctor & Gamble are all targets) become 
tiresome, and it's a little troubling how much grief he gives the 
average working guys who stop him (they are, after all, ordinary men and 
women trying to hold down a job  the kind of people Moore proclaims to 
be a voice for).  Moore also has a tendency to dwell on the obvious, 
such as how corrupt and subservient to big business the political 
process has become.
     On the other hand, THE BIG ONE also boasts some noteworthy scenes.  
One particularly disarming moment features a woman near to tears 
confessing to Moore that she has just been laid off.  The film maker, 
apparently not expecting this, seems genuinely moved by her plight.  On 
another occasion, Moore relates how Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan 
accepted a contribution from a group called the "Abortionists for 
Buchanan," how President Clinton took a check from the "Hemp Growers of 
America," and how Ross Perot felt compelled to reject $100 from the 
"Pedophiles for Free Trade."  There's a revelation about how much 
nearly-free prison labor is employed by large corporations  the next 
time a telemarketer calls, it may actually be someone in a jail cell.  
Finally, there's a hilarious proposal about how to reduce the nation's 
drug problem.
     The film's climax (inasmuch as a rambling pseudo-documentary can 
have a climax) features Moore's face-to-face meeting with Nike CEO Phil 
Knight.  It's not a particularly satisfying encounter for either man.  
Moore doesn't press very hard on the tough questions and Knight comes 
across as more out-of-touch than genuinely malevolent.  Like most of the 
rest of the film, this sequence gets the point across without offering 
much depth.  As for the title, there's actually a little mystery about 
what THE BIG ONE refers to  as far as I can tell, it's either the 
United States of America or Michael Moore's ego.

"The Big One" is a pleasurable comedy, masquerading as a documentary, focusing
on Michael Moore's attempts to focus on the truth surrounding the layoffs in
Michigan and around the United States. We see unemployed people barking at
Michael Moore and at the cameras about their poverty, Borders Bookstore
employees complaining about tax cuts on their paychecks, a woman crying to Moore
at one of his booksignings about her inability to find work, and the penultimate
moment when Moore confronts the Nike chairman and asks him why people in Mexico
are working for 80 cents an hour. 
"The Big One" has lots of scattered moments of truth, and plenty of it is just
hearsay - the scene where the workers yell to Moore is obviously staged. I
enjoyed the scenes where Moore and his video crew enter places of business and
are threatened to leave, or when he gives some associates and bigwigs a big, fat
check for 80 cents to the Mexican workers because "we want to help them out."
All of this will be very familiar to anyone who's seen "Roger and Me" or his TV
series "TV Nation." 
Moore has a lot of good arguments about what's happening to hard workers around
the country who work for candy companies or GM - if these corporations are
making so much money, why are there so many layoffs? One word: competition, so
they can be ahead of the others. That is why they pay so little to Mexican
vagrants or children in Mexico and other countries - it is cheap labor for
maximum profit. And then there are the airline workers who make flight
reservations - nothing unusual about that except some of them are prisoners! 
"The Big One" is very funny throughout and is more tightly edited than "Roger
and Me." Moore could have a career as a comedian if he wants it, but he is after
bigger game - to expose the truth through nuggets of humor. Some may say he is
just exploiting the workers he's documenting. I would say he's exploiting the
exploiters.

THE BIG ONE (1997) *** 1/2 Directed and written by Michael Moore. Produced
by Kathleen Gylnn. Cast: Michael Moore with appearances by Garrison
Keillor, Studs Terkel, Rick Neilson, Phil Knight and many ordinary people.
A BBC-Dog Eat Dog productio  released by Miramax.  94 min. PG-13 .
Did Michael Moore plot the release of his film close to that of
"Bulworth"'s? Did he contribute to the current turmoil in Indonesia? Of
course not, but his timing could not have been better.Both new films
denounce the political-big business establishment, while the Asian country
enters the argument in Moore's interviews of Nike's CEO about shoes made by
child labor paid just pennies an hour.
The initials MM long stood for Marilyn Monroe, but Michael Moore's are
becoming a close second. The contrast between the two personalities is like
Beauty Marilyn and Moore the capital-exposing Beast .The burly, paunchy,
embattled prole in baggy, slept-in clothes and his eternal baseball caps,
is perfect as a self-appointed vox populi for the masses of workers in the
United States, especially those laid off by large concerns.
The title comes from a radio interview where facetious MM proposes "The Big
One" as a replacement for the un-catchy name of our country. But it also
stands for the big corporations that make so many employees "redundant"  as
the British say, without regard to what happens to them next. That was the
theme of "Roger and Me," (1989) the wild documentary that made Moore a
celebrity as, in quest of answers, he chased after the Big Boss of General
Motors. The series "TV Nation" (1994)  lasted too little because their
special humor applied to serious subjects did not lay any golden eggs for
the network. Also in 1994, his satirical fiction feature "Canadian Bacon,"
mis-plotted and misguided was a bore that could fry but not fly. Wisely, MM
is back to the "Roger" mode, in which he's at his best in harrassing
corporations. There may be a sense of deja vu in "The Big One," but its
truths and facts are worth hammering on and expanding.
Moore became a best-selling author with his book "Downsize This!," a
collection of mocking, sharp, take-no-prisoners essays on today's America.
During the 1992 election campaign days, his publishers sent him on a
book-signing tour of close to 50 cities. Unbeknownst to them, MM had the
very bright idea of having a camera crew along to record everything, from
casual chats, to talking to groups, to his unconventional public lectures,
to his wagging his finger --always with a smiling presence -- at corporate
persons.
Embattled Moore has developed as a first-rate stand-up comic. Faithful to
his muckraking, to telling it like it is, to his protest mission, he gives
hilarious "performances" stressing the theme of Them and Us. He leaves few
stones unturned and few corporations un-stoned. Every chance he has, he
seeks out bigwigs of business (who by and large elude him), or their
spokespeople. His basic question is simply something like "Do you know what
you are doing to workers, and why do you do it?"
True, in 1992 the economy is booming in a period of fat cows, even obese
ones, but this does not help the many job-losers whose companies take their
business to places such as Indonesia or Mexico.
Itinerant evangelist  Moore cleverly starts his travels with Centralia,
Illinois, where the PayDay candy bar company causes much suffering by
closing its local works.You couldn't ask for  more pointed irony. As
Voltaire said "If God did not exist, he should have been invented." Pay Day
does exist.
There and in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sad men, and mothers lucky enough to have
found employment,  speak of their multiple part-time jobs that exhaust them
and keep them away from their families.In Des Moines, non-redundant but
part-time, minimum -wage employees at the Borders Books store, talk of
their problems. (Later we find out that encouraged by Moore they have
unionized. This results in other Borders stores banning MM from further
book-signings and adding grist to his mill! )
The local headquarters for presidential candidate Steven Forbes provide a
not-so-irrelevant diversion about "Who he ?" The young campaign manager is
not particularly savvy about his employer, while Moore calls attention to
the fact that Forbes, as clearly seen on TV footage, never blinks, a most
bizarre condition, as per a medical specialist. Could Forbes  be an E.T.?
MM's scattershot approach is a delight. In Milwaukee, Johnson Controls made
half a billion in profits in the last three years, yet is relocating to
Mexico. Although unable to see the head honcho, Moore does send him a
mammoth-sized check ... for 80 cents, the hourly earnings of Mexican
workers, as well as a Certificate for Downsizing. In that  city too is the
head office of the temp workers agency Manpower, Inc. which, declares
Moore, is now the largest employer in the country.
In a symbolic gag in Madison, Wisconsin, MM leads to the Capitol a bunch of
welfare people who will be happy to clean, for nothing, the Governor's
office. In Minneapolis-St.Paul, chatting with a tattoed ex-convict in a
cafeteria, he is told something scary as well as surrealistic:  TWA hires,
at $2 an hour, prisoners in jails to handle by telephone some of the
airline's reservations services. Adds Moore: "Many other firms do the same:
Spalding, Eddie Bauer, Microsoft, AT&T, etc." Bear this in mind next time
you're about to disclose information to just a voice.
Moore's attempts to meet with  CEOs are met by rebuffs and evasions that
range from polite to hostile. No matter whom he talks to, it is almost
creepy to see that all  business underlings are protective of their
companies, transparently insecure and scared of saying or doing anything
that might get their heads cut off.
The answers to Moore's questions are no more than what one expects. The
alibi-mantras include "To keep the company competitive," "Our
responsibility to our shareholders," "To increase earnings." Profit is the
A to Z motive. The film could have had other titles too, like those of the
American classic "Greed" for the business side or the Russian classic
"Stalker" for Moore's methods. So, he says to a roaring audience, how about
letting GM sell crack and make even bigger money?
In Chicago there is a short parenthesis as the invaluable Studs Terkel has
MM as his radio guest. In a true meeting of minds, humor is set aside in
favor of seriousmess and eagerness. This encounter runs only for a few,
touching minutes.
When Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike, Number 3 on MM's long hit list, agrees
to a meeting plus follow-up, it comes as a surprise. Both Knight and Moore
show good humor. It leads, however, to a cul-de-sac. Knight stands his
ground, comes up with a correction ("I checked: Indonesian workers are not
12 but 14"), believes (or pretends) that Americans don't want to make
shoes. Moore bets him he can come up with 500 people willing to do it. But
at a rally in Flint, by my count, fewer than 200 show up. No wonder that
Moore's report skips this fact. At least he will contribute $10,000 to the
unemployed if Knight matches this, which the Nike billionaire does.
These are merely a few examples of the richness of the documentary's in
episodes and details. The crusader has a knack for making comedy from
painful crises and getting a lot of laughs, yet without losing sight of
plights and pathos. Though now a capitalist from royalties, he remains
faithful to his social credos, contributes large sums to the needy, even
has a deal with film distributors Miramax to give away half of "The Big
One"'s profits.
As in all movies dealing with social justice and injustices, and as in all
agit-prop, Moore's work certainly simplifies vastly complex issues. His
sole consideration, in which he excels, is the human element. Critical
reception at festivals (Toronto 97, Berlin 98) has been very good. The
general public's reactions may ultimately depend on viewers' income. Those
unemployed or seriously underpaid will love the movie. Earners of high five
or low six figures, will like it if they are socially conscious. Above this
level there may be few takers, but it's no loss of audiences, since the
very wealthy seldom have time to spend on movies.

Last night I laughed out loud for the first time in months as I sat
through Michael Moore's new movie, "The Big One." The biggest laugh I
got was when Moore was commenting on presidential candidate Steve
Forbes tendency not to blink. During this riff, we see the distinctly
odd-looking Forbes staring at the TV camera during a debate. He
blinked not once for what seemed an eternity. Moore called an eye, ear
and nose specialist at a NY hospital and asked what the doctor he
thought of someone with the ability to go for minutes without
blinking. The doctor's reply was that "He doesn't sound human." This
leads Moore to speculate on the possibility that the Forbes campaign
is staffed by extraterrestrial aliens.
Bourgeois society is filled with comic material like this, but our
corporate-sponsored comedians manage to sidestep it entirely. This
self-imposed censorship leads to some really bland and pointless
entertainment. I have tried to figure out the Seinfeld craze to no
avail. I watch reruns late at night in stony silence. What is so funny
about four obnoxious characters sitting around discussing their dating
problems or where they can get a good meal? My building on Manhattan's
upper east side is filled with such people and I try to avoid them at
all costs.
Moore has been compared to David Letterman, whose "found humor" on the
old NBC show was quite edgy. Since Letterman has moved to CBS and
aspired to be the new "Johnny," he has lost me entirely. Whenever I
turn him on, he is usually grimacing at the camera and telling racist
jokes about NYC's immigrant cabbies. If Moore had a TV show, he'd
probably be conducting sympathetic and humorous interviews with NY's
cab-drivers who organized a highly successful one-day strike last
week. Come to think of it, Moore did have such a show, called "TV
Nation." His tendency to take the point of view of the underdog no
doubt explains his banishment from the air-waves.
The exclusion of Michael Moore from network television is as much a
form of political censorship as is the exclusion of important
working-class struggles today. For instance, the powerful struggle of
dock-workers in Australia to win back their jobs after the right-wing
government fired them en masse has not been reported in the NY Times.
The only time workers get their story reported is when they are in
conflict with a Communist government, as was the case of Poland's
Solidarity. It is Moore's distinction to attempt to be the voice of
our own evolving Solidarity movement all on his own.
"The Big One" records Michael Moore's forty-seven city book promotion
tour for "Downsize This!: Random Threats from an Unarmed American." In
many of these cities he organizes guerrilla media attacks on
downsizing corporations. It is the stuff of his hit movie "Roger and
Me" but expanded to new targets.
In Centralia, Illinois he attends the rally of Payday candy workers
whose factory is about to move to Mexico. He walks into corporate
headquarters with a huge check for eighty cents and presents it to an
unsmiling public relations representative from the company. He
announces that the check will go to pay the first hour's wages of
their first new Mexican worker. During the tour, the Payday
corporation is sold to a new company and Moore visits them as well.
They will not allow him into the lobby but he stands on the sidewalk
outside holding up the huge check to the window. He yells at a
surly-looking security guard inside that the eighty cent check is made
out to the new owners.
There is one moment in the film that drives home the seriousness of
the downsizing problem. Moore is chatting on air with legendary
talk-show host Studs Terkel, whose interviews with working-class
Americans in books such as "Working" have become classics. The
question of terrorism has come up. "Downsize This!" begins with
side-by-side photos of the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing and
the wreckage of a closed factory in Flint, Michigan, Moore's home
town. What is the difference between the two types of destruction? In
the first instance, the bombing was unannounced and hundreds of people
lost their lives. In the second, the company politely announces to the
workers that their jobs are coming to an end and they clear out. After
they are plunged into economic ruin, many die prematurely from
alcoholism, drugs or suicide--the products of despair.
The climax of the movie revolves around Moore's confrontation with
Philip Knight, the "new age" CEO of Nike shoes. Moore wants to know
why Nike does not have a single factory in the United States. Knight's
reply is that Americans don't want to make shoes. They consider this
type of work beneath them. This inspires Moore to organize a rally in
his home-town. Hundreds of unemployed workers hold up signs saying
that they want to make shoes.
Presented with this evidence, Knight remains unsympathetic. Any
unemployed worker will jump at the opportunity to have a job, but the
truly motivated workers exist in other countries such as Indonesia
where Nike has many of its plants. But doesn't Nike employ twelve year
olds in these factories, Moore challenges him. Knight's shameless
reply is that Nike does not hire anybody younger than fourteen.
Furthermore, whatever hardships Indonesian workers are putting up with
today is necessary for the prosperity they will enjoy tomorrow. The
Manhattanites in the audience with me laughed at the bitter irony of
this. Indonesia's "prosperity" has been sacrificed at the altar of
IMF-sponsored austerity programs and the country is going up in
flames.
Moore's encounter with Knight has a certain added poignancy for me. A
couple of years ago I visited an old ex-Trotskyite buddy of mine in
Portland who had become a top-ranking officer in Nike's computer
systems department. He had managed to discard all his Marxist beliefs
like an old pair of sneakers. We spent hour after hour debating
socialism versus capitalism in terms not dissimilar from the
Knight-Moore debate. I gave up after a certain point since I
understood that there were material interests preventing him from
seeing things the way he used to. He had joined the cult of the
upwardly mobile. In Portland the chief guru was Philip Knight and just
to the north in Seattle there was another one named Bill Gates.
The relationship between wealth and ideology is not necessarily
predetermined. Moore's success in film-making and publishing has made
him a multimillionaire. His new-found success has made him the target
of Alexander Cockburn's diatribes in the pages of the Nation Magazine.
No doubt, Moore is not as approachable as he used to be. Since he is
something of a philanthropist for the left, he has been bombarded with
requests over the years. Furthermore, he is something of an
ego-tripper by the evidence of "The Big One" itself, where his every
quirk and obsession becomes fodder for the movie. (If Moore is not
careful, he could turn into a Woody Allen, who lost his sense of humor
decades ago.)
Yet despite this, Moore remains dedicated to the task of enlightening
American society. Someday there will be a revitalized leftist
movement. The cultural workers who are part of this movement should
consider themselves apprentices of Michael Moore, who knows how to
communicate at the grass roots level. One of the misfortunes of the
1960's radicalization was its tendency to use the symbols and language
of other peoples' revolutions. Moore understands that if there is to
be another American revolution, it will have to be grounded in our own
experience. To familiarize oneself with this "home-grown" approach to
radical politics, a viewing of "The Big One" is essential. As a bonus,
you will laugh your head off.

     In an era of soaring stock markets, Republican Revolutions and enough
backlashes to give you whiplash, Michael Moore is something of an
anachronism:  part stand-up comic, part guerrilla film-maker but always
100% old-school liberal.  Moore became famous for his successful 1989
documentary ROGER & ME, in which he chronicled his Quixotic quest to speak
with General Motors CEO Roger Smith about the colsure of a manufacturing
plant in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  The intervening years have
found him dabbling in feature film-making (CANADIAN BACON), television
("TV Nation") and book writing (the best-selling "Downsize This! Random
Threats from an Unarmed American"), but the unifying thread in his work
has continued to be the deflating of corporate America, the anger
sweetened with a wink and a smile.
     Moore might be considered one of the most dangerous radicals in
America if only you didn't want to giggle every time you saw him.  His new
documentary THE BIG ONE is a hilariously unique piece of social commentary
as vaudeville, a cross between "60 Minutes" and David Letterman which
draws most of its laughs from Moore's mere presence.  The film follows
Moore on what is supposed to be a book tour for the 1996 release of
"Downsize This!", but actually serves as an excuse for Moore to pounce on
corporate down-sizers around the country.  In Centralia, Illinois, he
meets with a representative from Leaf Candy who explains that workers'
jobs could have been preserved "if (the factory) had been making less
money;" in Cincinnati, he hands Proctor & Gamble reps a Dubious
Distinction Award even as he shares his fondness for Tide detergent.
     The confrontations which make up the backbone of THE BIG ONE easily
could have been humorless kamikaze journalism if not for the fact that
it's Michael Moore holding the microphone.  With his round face, shaggy
hair and omnipresent baseball cap, Moore looks less like an investigative
reporter than he does the kind of guy who goes shirtless at Green Bay
Packer games.  He has an agenda, to be sure, but he's also a splendid
performer who makes it look easy drawing his flies with honey rather than
vinegar.  As entertaining as he may be in full concert mode -- describing
how 1996 presidential candidate Steve Forbes never blinks; explaining the
role of "shareholders" in the U.S. Constitution; suggesting that our
country change its name from the boring "United States" to the more
intimidating "The Big One" -- Moore is at his best as the self-effacing
goofball who ends up making others look like even bigger goofballs.
     Nowhere is this gift better displayed than in Moore's already
controversial encounter with the first CEO who ever agreed to meet him
personally, Nike boss Peter Knight.  When Moore asks Knight why Nike
employs child labor in Asia rather than American workers, Knight calmly
replies that "Americans don't really want to make shoes."  If Knight comes
off looking like the devil -- and with his Tim Curry grin, he certainly
looks the part -- it's not because he's acting in the economic best
interest of his company.  Knight simply doesn't have the guts to come out
with such an admission, a fact largely attributable to Moore's preferred
conversational style.
     It's rather foolish to accuse Moore of blantant propagandizing, since
he never bothers to hide the fact.  Occasionally he butts heads with
recalcitrant company drones past the point of diminishing returns, and a
couple of moments with "average Americans" (including a tearful session at
a book signing) appear either staged or needlessly like photo
opportunities.  Still, it's hard to imagine that even the staunchest
Libertarian won't find something to smile at in Moore's singular tapestry
of 1990s Americana.  That goofy round-faced guy in the baseball cap sure
knows how to make a lecture not seem like a lecture.

No, I haven't seen "Roger and Me" (and let's just forget "Candian Bacon" 
doesn't exist, eh?) but I do know a few things about Michael Moore, as I 
did happen to watch a couple minutes of his short-lived 
summer-replacement TV show "TV Nation" back in the day (and managed to 
glance over "Downsize This" in a bookstore once). He's a liberal with a 
whole lot of money and a loyal film crew, both which he uses to shake up 
the "system" in an attempt to get the point across about the downtrodden 
workers, which let me assure you there are in abundance (I'm one of 
them, though not of the I'm-not-getting-benefits kind, but of the lazy 
kind, not that benefits don't bother me). Physically he looks like a 
poor man's Roger Ebert, an oafish man with a big grin perpetually 
plastered on his face, not revealing his immense intelligence and making 
him easily approachable. He also has an incredible sense of humor, and 
that's his best weapon because otherwise no one would take him seriously 
(you've seen the typical angry demonstrators, and face it, you're as 
annoyed as I am). His other chief weapon is the camera, which he uses to 
embarass the hell out of those in control of workers' jobs, and who have 
no better explanation about mass lay-offs in profitable corporations 
than that someone's greedy. Oh, and he made a film called "Roger and 
Me," which, again, I haven't seen yet, but as I hear, it's about him 
going around with the camera in a northern town, trying to interview the 
CEO of a company that laid off millions of workers at the time.
It's been about a decade since that film hit, and a good thing and a bad 
thing have happened to Mr. Moore: a) he's not lost his sense of humor, 
but b) he's lost his focus...well, sorta. "The Big One" follows him on 
his book tour for "Downsize This," which he describes as the book he 
wrote just so people would still know he was alive (and thus the film), 
and the result is an episodic trip around the America, meeting book 
dates, giving interviews, holding auditorium-sized discussions, and, of 
course, meeting with either potential or actual unions. So every ten 
minutes, we get to see Moore and his crew talk with a union, and then do 
the noble thing of attempting to help them out, with means he tries to 
go right up and see the big cheese, at which point he's either giving a 
bunch of bullshit from the underlings or told by security to leave the 
premises (or at one point, lied that he'll get an interview with the 
president of a company).
And it's all great, priceless material because Moore is such a witty and 
down-to-earth guy, not merely a typical guilty-liberal, but a man who 
has the knowledge of how the system works, the funds to do what he can 
for them, and the showmanship to attract real attention. He's not afraid 
to humiliate people to get something proven (and many of the instances 
are totally worth the price of admission), even if nothing concrete 
actually happens until later. So basically, as I hear, nothing's 
changed...except for a little thing. Throughout the the film, there's a 
disturbing amount of self-gratification going on. More and more scenes 
of him in front of pleased crowds, a near-shameless scene where he gives 
hope and courage to a woman who lost her job the day she met him (and 
buying a 25 dollar hardcover book immeadiately after?), and a lot of 
reaction shots that show Moore listening like a great martyr. In fact, 
there's not much of a point of making this film. Other than showing that 
he's still hard at work, it also shows a side of Moore that takes 
pleasure in the way he helps people, and the entire film has creepy 
undertones of a big fat valentine directed at himself, albeit a 
subconcious one that I'm not sure he realized he was forming when he 
assembled the film together.
But it's so easy to merely brush that aside and ignore it so that you 
can just sit back and enjoy the way this film is made, which is more 
entertainment than social criticism. Moore's wit is heavily on display 
here, and even the aimlessness of the film's structure becomes 
appealing, because you just have no clue what he's going to do next. One 
minute, he could be signing books at Media Play; the next, jamming with 
Cheap Trick member Rick Nelson in his home right near by. It almost has 
the charm of an improv sketch, and Moore has such a great sense of fun 
and adventurism that "The Big One" comes off more like a really 
entertaining ride, even more entertaining if you buy into his philosophy 
(which I do, for the most part). And he concludes it with the one thing 
he couldn't provide in "Roger and Me": an actual filmed interview with a 
CEO. In a priceless bit of movie-dom, Moore sits down for two long 
tete-a-tetes with Nike CEO Phil Knight, accusing him of everything he 
can, humiliating him, yet still coming off as friendly and polite to 
him, and ditto with Knight. The entire last section of the film is 
easily the best, and even if maybe part of the charm of "Roger and Me" 
was that you didn't actually get to see any kind of cherished interview 
transpire (I'm only guessing here), it actually doesn't matter since the 
entire point of the film is that of entertainment. In fact, "The Big 
One" may actually be one of the funnier, more entertaining films of the 
year. But what was the point of Moore even making the film? Beats me. I 
guess it has something to do with him not selling out.

THE BIG ONE (1997) - A pleasurable comedy, masquerading as a documentary,
focusing on Michael Moore's attempts to focus on the truth surrounding the
layoffs in Michigan and around the United States. We see unemployed people
barking at Michael Moore and at the cameras about their poverty, Borders
Bookstore employees complaining about tax cuts on their paychecks, a woman
crying to Moore at one of his booksignings about her inability to find work, and
the penultimate moment when Moore confronts the Nike chairman and asks him why
people in Mexico are working for 80 cents an hour. 
"The Big One" has lots of scattered moments of truth, and plenty of it is just
hearsay - the scene where the workers yell to Moore is obviously staged. I
enjoyed the scenes where Moore and his video crew enter places of business and
are threatened to leave, or when he gives some associates and bigwigs a big, fat
check for 80 cents to the Mexican workers because "we want to help them out."
All of this will be very familiar to anyone who's seen "Roger and Me" or his TV
series "TV Nation." 
Moore has a lot of good arguments about what's happening to hard workers around
the country who work for candy companies or GM - if these corporations are
making so much money, why are there so many layoffs? One word: competition, so
they can be ahead of the others. That is why they pay so little to Mexican
vagrants or children in Mexico and other countries - it is cheap labor for
maximum profit. And then there are the airline workers who ! 
"The Big One" is very funny throughout and is more tightly edited than "Roger
and Me." Moore could have a career as a comake flight reservations - nothing
unusual about that except some of them are prisoners in jailmedian, but he is
after bigger game - to expose the truth through nuggets of humor. Some may say
he is just exploiting the workers he's documenting. I would say he's exploiting
the exploiters.

   What would Michael Moore say about the New York Times
article of 2/10/98, which questions the usual
(liberal) view of downsizing?  Says America's most prestigious
daily newspaper, "Month after month the Labor Department
reports the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 
358,000 were added in January....well-paid middle
managers and other upper-level office workers are being
hired in big numbers....The study challenges views about the
work force.  One is that corporate downsizing has decimated
middle-level management...but hiring has outpaced the
layoffs...Corporate America is starved for people highly skilled
in technology."
   No problem for Moore.  The workers with whom he
sympathizes and emphathizes do not have the options of the
mroe mobile and educated unemployed.  One of the few
filmmakers who can make a hilarious documentary about a
serious subject, Moore is firmly on the side of Middle
Americans who have lived all their lives in their towns, areas
like Flint, Cincinnati, and Centralia.  They take pride in their
generally routine jobs, and have been despondent since
receiving pink slips through no fault of their own.  These are
the real Americans, those with firm roots in their abodes, who
are not the sorts who can simply pick up and travel halfway
around the country to where the jobs are.  Why have they
been fired or, as the current expression would have it,
downsized?  Simply because their companies wanted to make
more profit by locating their plants in underdeveloped
countries like Mexico and Indonesia.  What's wrong with trying
to maximize profit in this way?  Nothing, if you're a high
corporate executive who believes that this is your sole
purpose.  Plenty if you're Michael Moore, who believes that if
a company is MAKING HUGE PROFITS, it has a
RESPONSIBILITY to share some of this wealth with its
American employees.
   Michael Moore is well known among movie buffs as the
writer-director of one of the most celebrated documentaries,
"Roger and Me," a droll tale of his crusade to meet with
Roger Smith, Chairman of General Motors, to discuss with
him the decision to close the GM factories in Moore's home
town of Flint, Michigan.  As shown by that film and his current
one, Moore's talent extends beyond his ability to write a
whimsical script and even his talent at the helm of his films. 
Most important he is a stand-up comic of the first order, one
who wears his heart on his sleeve and whose sincerity is
obvious to any sensitive person watching him at work in his
favorite role of gadfly to the Establishment.  
   The title of his current movie, "The Big One" refers not to
President Clinton (or any aspect of the chief executive) but to
the country as a whole.  Among his many opinions is that the
name "The United States of America" is a dull one, certainly
when compared to, say, "The United Kingdom" or "Great
Britain," and that our nation should more accurately be called
"The Big One."  His focus is the downsizing trend which has
become stylish in corporate America, and, in fact he even
wrote the number one best-seller "Downsize This!"  He puts
across his views in the most entertaining way imaginable,
traveling about the mid-west interviewing workers and
executive alike, performing stand-up comedy to appreciative
crowds everywhere, and throwing in asides when the mood
strikes. The result is a kaleidoscopic look at a national
affliction: the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of loyal
employees simply because the big bosses can get the jobs
done outside the country at one-tenth the labor costs.
   Among the asides which can disarm even the grouchiest of
audiences, he describes to an appreciative crowd of college
youngsters that during the presidential campaign of '96 he
conducted an experiment to test the greed of the candidates. 
He set up some dummy corporations which issued small
checks to the aspirants, in one case mailing $100 to Pat
Buchanan's campaign from "Abortionists for Buchanan."  The
right-wing journalist cashed the check.  When Moore's book
"Downsize This!" came out, Random House, his publisher,
sent him on a marketing tour which the documentary
filmmaker turned into this splendid, heartfelt and very funny
documentary about the effects of the policy of downsizing.
   Thrown out by security guards and publicists for some
major corporations for entering their buildings with his small
army of camera people, he is enthusiastically received by
downsized workers everywhere.  At a Payday factory in
Centralia Illinois, he commiserates with packers who have
spent five, ten, twenty years with the company and are now
tossed out because they were too productive!  The plants
relocated to Mexico. Once, whenever a company
spokesperson cited for the umpteenth time the need to
maximize profits, Moore retorts, "Then why doesn't General
Motors sell crack?"  Moore explores one situation in which
prison labor is used by TWA to book reservations, because
the incarcerated could be paid just two dollars an hour.  His
most intriguing interview is with Phil Knight, the hip-looking
CEO of Nike corporation, which makes America's most
popular and profited athletic shoes.  The trouble is that none
of these shoes (save one) are made in the U.S.  The
assemblers are workers as young as fourteen in Indonesia,
whose laborers cannot even afford shoes for themselves and
where they are paid twenty cents an hour.  (Michael Jordan
receives $20 million annually from the corporation, more than
the entire 30,000 strong labor force in Indonesia.) 
Remarkably, Knight wants Moore to believe that "Americans
do not want to make shoes."  When Moore proves the chief
executive wrong by showing him documentary footage, the
latter retorts that the unemployed are desperate and will say
anything--but cannot be trusted to stick to the job for long.
   Technically, the movie is messy, which is understandable
given the need to transport cameras to various locations in a
flash and, in some cases to hide them from the people being
filmed.  It's difficult to leave this work without feeling a strong
support for unions, for labor in general.  Moore certainly
realizes that to put across points most efficiently, you've got to
keep the audience laughing.  "The Big One" should be
required viewing for members of the working class who
blithely cross picket lines, lines of people who, like them, are
struggling on $5, $6 or $8 an hour.  The movie is an
education in class-consciousness which can be enjoyed even
by those without a political thought in their heads. Not rated. 
Running time: 96 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998

     Unlike those who think documentaries exist only in the landscape
of serious ideas like the study of famine or repression, Michael Moore
sees the genre in a completely different terrain.  He envisions the art
form as a way to mix theater of the absurd with standup comedy, and he
wraps this all around a serious subject.  In his latest movie, the
maker of the famous ROGER & ME tackles the issue of corporate
downsizing in America.  But don't be taken in, this is just a ruse to
let Moore demonstrate his considerable talent as a comedian.  In one of
the funnier movies this year, THE BIG ONE takes an unabashedly
one-sided position on a subject that it really cares little about and
produces one funny sequence after another.
     The picture, which alternates between Moore's appearances in front
of college audiences and his confrontations with public relations
people at recently downsized firms, starts with a traditional
monologue.  Filmed in 1996 when he was on a book tour to promote his
book "Downsize This! Random Thoughts From An Unarmed American," he
starts by describing the results of his phony letter scam.
     Using official-looking letterhead and checks, he donated $100 to
each of the major presidential candidates, allegedly from groups that
each would most likely find offensive.  Pat Buchanan's check, for
example, was from Abortionists for Buchanan.  Every organization cashed
the checks.  He even got a computer-generated response, he claimed,
from the Perot organization, thanking "Pedophiles of America for Free
Trade" for their generous donation.  The college audience went wild as
he told the story.
     When the Clinton organization found out after the fact that they
had been hoodwinked, presidential press secretary Mike McCurry
complained on television that Moore was an evil influence in politics.
Moore's response in the film is to show pictures of the Lincoln bedroom
and say his problem was that he just didn't donate enough to get any of
the perks.
     This fast-paced documentary veritably pulsates with energy.  Using
music as charged as the film's star and editing it with a deft touch,
the movie never flags even if the last half does begin to get
repetitious.
     Skewering everyone, he develops a thesis that Steve Forbes is
actually an alien from outer space.  In typical Moore fashion, he takes
an outlandish position and uses humor to make his point via
pseudo-scientific analysis.
     The show is at its most awkward when Moore meets people who have
actually been downsized.  He is in his element making low-level human
resource people and company guards squirm, but comforting someone with
real problems does not come naturally to him.  The bottom line is that,
as social commentary, the film is an abysmal failure, but, as comedy,
it delivers.  (It also has the misfortune of being released in a time
when we have the lowest unemployment rate in several decades, so the
tragedy of downsizing is no longer on many newspaper headlines or many
people's minds.)
After ridiculing a long list of companies, where he never gets he
further than the lobby, Moore finally hits potential pay dirt when Phil
Knight, the CEO of Nike, invites him in for an interview.  Although the
jubilant Moore tries his best to make him look foolish, Knight finds
the whole episode hilarious, laughing through almost every minute of
it.
     So where does the title of the movie come from?  In the funniest
segment of all, Moore discusses how we could better market "The United
States of America."  He argues that this name on battleships doesn't
have near the power of something like "Great Britain," whom he calls a
little island with an impressive name.  He proposes we rename our
country, "The Big One," since that's how we see our place in the world
anyway.
     He goes on to propose the music, "We will, we will - rock you," as
a more powerful national anthem, cutting to a pumped-up crowd singing
it while lasers pulsate around them.  And finally, in place of our
coinage's "In God We Trust," he suggests a motto better suited to
current American culture, "In by 10, out by 2."
     THE BIG ONE runs a fast 1:36.  It is rated PG-13 for some strong
language and would be fine for kids around twelve and up.

Michael Moore, best known for his anti-GM documentary Roger and Me, has
set himself up as the working man's hero.  He prides himself in sticking
it to corporations where it hurts, and never taking his focus off the
little guy.  The Big One is his latest documentary (a welcome change of
pace after his abysmal Canadian Bacon), and in it, he does what he does
best.
During 1996, Moore undertakes a multi-city book tour to promote his
book, Downsize This: Random Threats From An Unarmed American.  He brings
along a film crew, ostensibly to document the tour, but he has another
agenda in mind.
Big corporations have been reveling in Wall Street's billion dollar
profits, and yet layoffs and downsizing continue to be the norm.  Moore
uses his book tour as the basis of a quest to find someone who can tell
him why.
As he travels from city to city, the story randomly unfolds.  Sometimes
he is simply meeting with laid off employees at his book signing.  At
other times he talks with employees struggling to form a union.  And
then there are his classic corporate ambushes, where, with film crew in
hand, he tries to force his way in to meet with a CEO, to deliver such
awards as "Downsizer of the Year", or a check to pay the first hour of
the first Mexican worker in a company's new plant.
Moore's corporate humor, while obviously biased, is apt, and the
highlight of the film. He stumbles a bit when he ventures into political
humor however.  The 1996 campaign already seems like the distant past,
and is only going to seem more and more dated.
The film is never quite as biting as Roger and Me.  Some of this arises
from the impromptu feel of the film, but overall his antics seem much
more forced here. The "in-your-face" school of journalism is at full
force here.  A lot of the film is composed of cheap shots...but they're
funny cheap shots.
If you enjoyed Roger and Me, The Big One delivers more of the same (just
not in the same dose).  Moore's offbeat brand of humor should have
something to slightly amuse nearly anybody, even if you don't quite
agree with his politics.

Has success spoiled Michael Moore?
The downsized-worker-turned-filmmaker from Flint seemed like a renegade
David taking on a corporate Goliath when he documented his thwarted quest to
meet General Motors chairman Roger Smith in the 1989 feature "Roger and Me."
Moore cheerfully filled the role of an Everyman speaking out for a
middle-class pounded by a recession President George Bush denied was going
on.
In the years since "Roger," however, Moore has starred in the "TV Nation"
series, directed the feeble feature "American Bacon" and written "Downsize
This: Random Threats From An Unarmed American," which hit the New York Times
best-seller list (as Moorešs latest documentary "The Big One" takes great
pains to tell us).
In fact, "The Big One" centers around Moorešs misadventures on a nationwide
tour to promote his book, so right off the bat we know his days as a
commoner are long-gone. Now he flies first-class (he tries to look
embarrassed by it), is chauffeured by perky "media liaisons" (they become
easy targets for his barbs) and gives speeches in auditoriums and bookstores
filled with fawning fans.
But despite his fame Moore is still on the lookout for greedy business
tycoons looking to make a few extra bucks by closing factories and cutting
jobs.
It turns out he has numerous offenders to choose from, including the owners
of the Payday candy-bar factory in Centralia, Ill., where management freely
admits theyšre shutting down because the workers made the plant too
profitable, thus endangering the companyšs pending sale.
His minor skirmishes with middle-management types leads up to what Moore
must have seen as the challenge of a lifetime: the opportunity to meet
face-to-face with unctuous Nike CEO Phil Knight who, Moore accuses, has
built his fortune off the sweat of teen-age Indonesian girls who make tennis
shoes in his overseas factories for 40 cents an hour. Americans, Knight
rationalizes, donšt want to make shoes.
If therešs a serious flaw to "The Big One" it lies in Moorešs tendency to
mistake self-glamorization for credibility. Much more so than in "Roger and
Me," hešs the star of the show here, and donšt think he doesnšt know it.
When Moore includes a snippet of White House press secretary Mike McCurry
calling him "a dangerous person," itšs a bit obvious Moore sees this as a
badge of honor, and therešs an excessive amount of footage devoted to Moore
cheerleading for a band of Borders Books and Music employees struggling to
unionize.
"The Big One" is unequivocally a sermon to the converted, but itšs
frequently a bitterly funny one. When Moore probes the weird world of
corporate subsidies, investigating why the government has given Pillsbury
millions to promote their products in the Third World, the clips from a
commercial with a Spanish-speaking Pillsbury Doughboy are as hilarious as
they are creepy. Even material thatšs now slightly dated, such as Moorešs
campaign-contribution stunt, is still giggle-worthy.
