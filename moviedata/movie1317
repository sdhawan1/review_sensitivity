   You hear it all the time from disgruntled patrons of
Broadway's musical theater.  "What's with the stage these
days?" they complain. "You leave a show and you don't have
a single song that you can hum."  While I've rarely seen
people actually "humming" when they left their seats during
the golden age of the American musical, the modern
complaints have some merit.  Fans of Stephen Sondheim
may say with their noses in the air that the absence of
melody nowadays is a plus--that easy-to-mimic tunes are not
only dated but simple-minded--but this rejoiner comes across
as sour grapes.  Truth to tell, there was only one
Renaissance in the history of the West, Spain had its one
golden age, Athens was once the center of civilization but is
certainly not that now, and the great era that gave us Cole
Porter, the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, Lerner and Loewe,
Rodgers and Hammerstein and the like is over.  Kaput.
   We welcome revivals of the relative handful of great
musicals with open arms. This time the nationally famous art-
house, New York's Film Forum, is the scene of a rekindling of
"Kiss Me Kate," which plays there from July 7 through July
20.  Though the glasses you'll get at the box office may give
you a headache (especially if your nose already bears a pair
of its own), the Film Forum is tossing out this musical version
of "The Taming of the Shrew" in remarkable 3-D.  People of a
certain age like me can pretend that after the movie they can
resume rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers, playing stoop ball
and marbles, while the young 'uns can be introduced to a
technology that was the hottest thing in its day ("House of
Wax," "Bwana Devil") but like Internet stocks seems to have
wound up on history's stockpile of has-beens.
   Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel star in this classic
musical.  If you think that Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton
make good music together, you might change your mind
when you watch their characters, Lilli Vanessi as the Bard's
Katherine and Fred Graham as the great man's Petruchio
make goo-goo eyes at each other, fight like crazy, make goo-
goo eyes and fight--in either case showing that their
relationship by modern standards is too damn hot.
   The subplot involving a romance between Ann Miller's Lois
Lane in the "Taming" role of Bianca and Keenan Wynn's
Lippy doesn't match that fervor, but boy can Miss Ann dance. 
Her showstopping number, "Too Damn Hot," pops up almost
before you've put on your tinted glasses and you're on the
fast track with one of the hottest (if not entirely civilized)
pieces of choreography in musical theater history.
   Just think of how Shakespeare has been mangled in the
current production of "Love's Labour's Lost" which, ironically,
uses some of Cole Porter's songs, but the dances just plain
don't fit.  In this case, thanks to the genius of George Sidney
at the helm, there's never a dull moment nor a single
instance of a song or dance simply shoehorned in with no
bearing on the story.  So brush up your Porter if you must
have a background before seeing this, and go!

        It's a moviegoer's maxim that, when a film is based on material from 
another medium -- a book, a play, a TV drama -- "the movie will always be 
inferior to the source material."  But that tired notion is eclipsed, if not 
demolished, by M-G-M's "Kiss Me Kate" (1953), a sparkling and energetic 
version of the 1948 Broadway musical triumph written by Sam and Bella 
Spewack, with a dazzling score by Cole Porter.
        Much has been written over the years about the charm and durability 
of Porter's melodies and the cleverness of the Spewacks' libretto.  
Well-deserved tributes, both; but not enough has been said about the 
imaginative ways in which the movie version of "Kiss Me Kate"improves on the 
stage original.  The Spewacks crafted an ingenious, double-tiered story about 
a play within a play, in which the stars' backstage bickering mirrors the 
bickering of the characters they play on stage.  For the movie, Dorothy 
Kingsley re-fashioned the libretto into a seamless shooting script that 
"opens up" the story and smooths out some of the rough edges.
        The story concerns a group of actors performing a musical version of 
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew".  The male star and director of the 
show, Fred Graham (Howard Keel), was once married to his leading lady Lilli 
Vanessi (Kathryn Grayson), for whom he still carries a torch.   Lilli is 
temperamental and a spitfire, but still capable of great affection if a man 
proves himself worthy of it.  In this uneasy atmosphere, they launch their 
new collaboration: He as Petruchio, she as Katharine, the shrew Petruchio 
must tame.
        Complicating matters is the presence of a supporting actress, Lois 
Lane (Ann Miller), who is to play Bianca, the younger sister of Katharine.  
Lois and Graham have a light flirtation going, but she is no more constant 
than Lilli is; in fact, Lois is semi-engaged to Bill Calhoun (Tommy Rall), a 
dancer who will play Lucentio in the show.
        The first evidence of Kingsley's genius (and that of director George 
Sidney) is seen right after the opening credits.  In a scene not in the stage 
original, the fade-in takes us to Fred Graham's apartment, where he is 
welcoming Lilli, Lois, and Cole Porter himself (in the person of actor Ron 
Randell).  They discuss doing the show, Fred and Lilli sing the beautiful 
love duet "So in Love", then Lois does a sizzling, take-no-prisoners tap 
routine to the lively "Too Darn Hot".  The dance is so spectacular, as Lois 
whirls about the room in a skimpy red dress trimmed with fringe, it 
invariably draws wild applause from the audience whenever the film is 
revived.  Today, "Too Darn Hot" is usually cited as "the definitive Ann 
Miller number" by fans of her musicals.
        Dazzling though her dance routine is, Lois is soon informed by the 
two men present that the song has been taken out of the show.  "There's no 
place to put it", explains Porter.  That might have been an in-joke in 1953, 
because in real life that was almost the fate of the song, in the original 
stage play.  "Too Darn Hot" has no real place in the narrative of the show, 
so it is usually sung by a chorus of dancers performing between acts of the 
play within the play.  It was considered so expendable that, in 1958, when 
NBC-TV staged a performance of "Kiss Me Kate" as part of its prestigious 
Hallmark series, "Too Darn Hot" was simply dropped from the show.  But it 
lives on, spectacularly, in the movie.
        Howard Keel's Fred is self-absorbed and vainglorious, but at least he 
isn't the insufferable ham played by Alfred Drake in the stage play.  Drake's 
broad, extravagant gestures may have played well to the balcony, but in a 
film, restraint is called for, and Keel provides it admirably.  Grayson, for 
her part, gives us an interesting Lilli/Katharine, a shrew with a heart.  In 
both roles, she lets us see her own vulnerability, even as she is throwing 
dishes or throwing a punch.  This is a shrew made to be tamed, by the right 
man.
        When Fred and Lilli's bickering escalates into all-out war -- on 
stage, on opening night, in front of a packed house -- she ad-libs insults, 
slaps, kicks... until finally, exasperated, Fred puts his ex-wife and co-star 
across his lap and gives her a sound spanking in front of the footlights.  In 
the stage version with Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison, as in every stage 
revival of the show since, this scene was performed as part of the show, on 
center stage, under the proscenium arch.  But for the film version, director 
George Sidney had it photographed from behind the two stars, so that the 
movie audience sees a background of perhaps 2,000 first-nighters viewing the 
scene from their theater seats.  In a uniquely cinematic moment, we are made 
aware that we are witnessing the most public spanking of all time.
        But Fred Graham's "triumph" is short-lived.  Backstage during 
intermission, Lilli belts him again, then angrily announces that she is 
walking out on the show.  He does manage to keep her onstage (through a 
comedic subterfuge), and by the fade-out, you get the feeling that these two 
sparring partners are ready to hang up their gloves.  Somehow, you doubt that 
their fragile egos can survive together for very long; but for now, at least, 
all is Edenic bliss.
        Good as the leads are, the movie version of "Kiss Me Kate" belongs to 
the dancers.  Ann Miller had the best role of her career, and she responded 
with some of the finest dancing ever seen on the silver screen.  In this, she 
had a formidable team to work with: Choreographer Hermes Pan, and fellow 
dancers Tommy Rall, Bob Fosse, Bobby Van, Carol Haney, and Jeannie Coyne.  
Miller's dance duets with Rall are sharp and inventive, in particular "Why 
Can't You Behave?", danced on a Manhattan rooftop (another example of the 
camera's ability to "open up" a scene), and the slyly erotic "Always True to 
You Darling in My Fashion" (Pan makes a brief appearance here, as a sailor on 
the prowl).
        As was customary in M-G-M musicals in the Golden Age, the best number 
is saved for last; and a delectable treat it is.  In one last, bravura 
display of the film's superiority to the stage play, the final dance number 
uses a song, "From This Moment On", that was not in the original play, but 
was lifted from a 1950 Cole Porter show, "Out Of This World".  It is an 
inspired choice.  Hermes Pan uses all six lead dancers in a brightly-colored, 
lively and kinetic mating ritual, with the dancers taking turns pairing off 
in separate pas de deux.  Tommy Rall and Ann Miller dance the first sequence, 
giving way to Bobby Van and Jeannie Coyne.  Then, for the third duet, we get 
to see the only dance in the movie not choreographed by Hermes Pan.   This is 
Bob Fosse's turf: We see Fosse and the wonderfully agile Carol Haney take 
center stage in a finger-snapping, back-flipping, jazzy interlude that sets 
the screen ablaze.  Their duet lasts only 1 min. 6 sec., but for that one 
minute the screen is on fire.  
        Katharine's final speech is truncated Shakespeare: "I am asham'd that 
women are so simple... To offer war where they should kneel for peace....", 
but Grayson makes the most of it; and, in yet another triumph of the screen 
version, this time the speech is spoken rather than sung, as it was in the 
play.  This allows Katharine to put a neo-feminist "spin" on the words, 
implying through inflection and gesture that Petruchio may have tamed his 
shrew this time, but he had best watch his step in the future.  This is no 
surrender, it's a marital detente.  And it is the genius of "Kiss Me Kate" -- 
both the play and the film -- that we feel the story's happy resolution on 
two levels at once: Between Petruchio and Katharine, and between Fred and 
Lilli.  That's the magic of great story-telling, and it is the particular 
magic of "Kiss Me Kate".
