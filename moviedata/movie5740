     In Holland 06 is the code for special services, including sex
lines.  Here complete strangers can meet and share their personal
fantasies.  Thomas replies to Sara's advert and soon they are involved
in exploring their erotic fantasies over the phone.  Thursday nights
become their regular "date."  But Sara has control as Thomas doesn't
have her number.  And only towards the end of the film does Thomas
start to influence the direction of the relationship.
     06 is a slow-moving, minimalist movie which explores the anonymity
and absurdity of telephone sex without sending it up.  Here is a world
that exists only in fantasy, where lovers can adopt whatever physical
characteristics, dress or sexuality that they chose, and where lies are
rarely found out.  This is a bittersweet if sometimes laboured account
of two peoples attempts to balance the erotic attraction of talking
dirty to a complete stranger and their denial that this is part of the
lives.  Thomas's reaction when Sara describes, in detail, a recent
sexual exploit to him is intriguing, raising questions whether theirs
is a real relationship or not.  This movie will probably get no further
than the arts clubs, but is fascinating viewing for those interested in
the politics of sex.
