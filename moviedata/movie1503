Back in the days before Lolita', there was a movie called The Black
Rose' which carried a questionable G rating. The hero, Walter of Gurnie
(Tyrone Power), is the illegitimate child of a Saxon Lord who is denied
his inheritance and birthright. In an effort to find his fortune, he
journeys to the middle-east and joins Kublai Khan's army which is about
to invade China.
It is here that the film's controversy arises. The Black Rose' Maryam,
is a prepubescent teenager (at least 13 years of age, but played by an
actress who was 18 but looks 13), daughter of a white man who is on her
way as a gift to Kublai. She is rescued by Tyrone Power and Co. whilst
trying to escape the life of a concubine in the harem of the Mongul
King. Like most stories go, she falls in love with the hero and an
interesting chauvinistic relationship follows. The man treats the girl
like a servant and she seems to enjoy it  I wander whether this is
reflective of the era?
The final scene is a passionate kiss between the thirty something Tyrone
Powers and the 13 year old looking Cecile Aubry. No quite Lolita', but
comes a close second.
