     When it comes to movies, there are two things that the early-to-
mid-1980s are best known for:  slasher films and teen comedies.  While 
the former category was hard-pressed to give birth to a vaguely 
watchable entry, quality was widely variable in the latter, spanning the 
spectrum from the dregs of PORKY's to the top-notch entertainment of 
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  One of the most consistent 
writer/directors to contribute to the '80s teen fad was John Hughes (the 
man who would later scale the heights of box-office prosperity with HOME 
ALONE).  In one way or another, Hughes was responsible for the likes of 
SIXTEEN CANDLES, PRETTY IN PINK, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL, FERRIS 
BUELLER'S DAY OFF, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  While all of those films 
were a cut above the sex and booze-drenched antics of most teen 
comedies, THE BREAKFAST CLUB was arguably the most insightful and 
emotionally-true of them.
     THE BREAKFAST CLUB is very different from almost every other entry 
into what was (at the time) a burgeoning genre.  Instead of relying on 
the staples of bare flesh, crass humor, and brainless plots, this movie 
focuses on five dissimilar characters, is almost entirely dialogue-
driven, and doesn't offer even a glimpse of a breast or buttock.  It's a 
story about communication gaps, teen isolation, and the angst that 
everyone (regardless of how self-assured they seem) experiences during 
the years that function as a transition from the freedom of adolescence 
to the responsibilities of adulthood.
     Even though the premise sounds a little dry, THE BREAKFAST CLUB is 
eminently watchable and consistently entertaining, even when it falters.  
Perhaps aware that his primary audience would be the 14-to-18 year-old 
crowd, Hughes added several surreal and silly sequences to interrupt the 
predominantly serious tone that suffuses the proceedings.  These don't 
really work, but the shift in tone isn't sufficiently glaring to disturb 
the movie's overall flow.
     The Breakfast Club is a small group of high school students, who, 
during the course of a nine-hour Saturday detention, are transformed 
from complete strangers to confidantes.  For each of them, it is an 
unforgettable day, and, while the friendships they form between 7 am and 
4 pm may disintegrate once they get back into the real world, feelings 
are explored and emotions unearthed that give them insights into their 
own lives and the forces that drive the others.  These are the kinds of 
realizations which, if more high school students understood them, might 
make grades nine through twelve a little less traumatic.
     The characters trapped in detention are all very different 
individuals.  Hughes sets them up as traditional stereotypes, then 
delights in slowly peeling back the layers, showing how each suffers 
from surprisingly similar problems.  There's the jock, wrestling star 
Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez); the most popular girl in school, Claire 
Standish (Molly Ringwald); the all-brains, no-brawn geek, Brian Johnson 
(Anthony Michael Hall); the rebel without a cause, John Bender (Judd 
Nelson); and the outcast, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy).  It turns out 
that none of them communicates well with their parents, all are under 
tremendous pressure from their peers, and each is beset by angst about 
the future.  Pretty obvious observations, right?  Yet few films before 
or after have dealt with these issues as intelligently as THE BREAKFAST 
CLUB.
     Another traditional Hughes theme can be seen running throughout the 
entire film:  the basic intolerance and stupidity of adults.  This is 
evident in several ways, from the obvious (a nasty teacher, played by 
Paul Gleason, who revels in his power) to the subtle (the children 
dreading the possibility that they might grow up to become like their 
parents).  The over-25 crowd rarely fares well in Hughes movies, and 
this is no exception, but there is a scene in THE BREAKFAST CLUB which 
attempts (with limited success) to partially humanize The Authority 
Figure.
     Hughes has assembled a unique and singularly effective cast.  
Emilio Estevez, although a little too old to play a high school teenager 
(he was 22 at the time of filming), does a good job presenting the human 
side of the athlete on a pedestal.  Judd Nelson, also a little on the 
old side (age 24), is believable as the James Dean-type who is looking 
for some kind of acceptance and uses his pugnaciousness as a defense 
mechanism.  Molly Ringwald, the star of three Hughes films (the other 
two being SIXTEEN CANDLES and PRETTY IN PINK), gives the strongest 
performance by showing the ugly, shallow side of being Ms. Popularity.  
Ally Sheedy is suitably weird as a compulsive liar and thief who takes a 
long time to open up.  Anthony Michael Hall looks the part of the geek, 
but, of the five lead actors, his is the least impressive portrayal; 
Brian has trouble escaping from the stereotypical sinkhole in which he 
begins the movie.
     Few will argue that THE BREAKFAST CLUB is a great film, but it has 
a candor that is unexpected and refreshing in a sea of too-often generic 
teen-themed films.  The material is a little talky (albeit not in a way 
that will cause anyone to confuse it with something by Eric Rohmer), but 
it's hard not to be drawn into the world of these characters.  The 
depiction of high school is evocative because it's so accurate (an 
actual suburban Illinois high school was used as the filming location).  
Unlike many teen films, which seem to transpire in some kid's dirty 
imagination, this picture, despite its occasional flights of fancy, is 
grounded in reality.  In THE BREAKFAST CLUB, Hughes has created a 
surprisingly enduring motion picture that is still effective 13 years 
after its theatrical debut.

        A woman claiming to be my #1 fan has begged me for 
months to watch and review this 80's staple and, not wanting to get my 
ankles shattered with a sledgehammer, I decided to oblige her. She 
told me THE BREAKFAST CLUB was her favorite movie and she'd 
watched it scores of times and even reenacted the movie herself with 
action figures. I expected it to be good--after all, this woman has the 
good taste to be obsessed with my writing. Of course, it turns out I 
didn't like THE BREAKFAST CLUB as much as I thought I would and 
only gave it a two-and-a-half star rating, so I may get the 
sledgehammer treatment yet.
        The movie works in theory--an ambitious teen comedy from 
John Hughes (WEIRD SCIENCE, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF) 
taking place almost entirely in a high school library where five 
completely different students are spending their Saturday in detention 
for one transgression or another. The concept appealed to me, as did 
the movie's opening, which featured voice-overs from each of the 
characters as they arrived for their punishment (to the background 
strains of an extended version of Simple Minds' "Don't You Forget 
About Me"). I kept waiting for some brilliant comedy dialogue to come 
along, but except for a few small laughs, not too much entertainment 
transpired.
        The characters are cut out of the basic teen stereotypes. 
There's the rebellious Neanderthal (Judd Nelson, who might as well be 
called Judd Dredd), the stuck-up "princess" (Molly Ringwald, entering 
her eighth minute of fame here), the wrestling-letter jock (Emilio 
Estevez), the brainy nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and the antisocial 
freak (Ally Sheedy). These five people would normally never associate 
with each other, but the circumstances force them to get to know each 
other and eventually, as the laws of predictability clearly state, become 
friends.
        Predictability reigns supreme in THE BREAKFAST CLUB 
without ever having any original insights to redeem it. When you have 
a movie that consists of 95% dialogue, the dialogue better be 
something good, alternatingly funny or poignant. The majority of the 
time, THE BREAKFAST CLUB is neither. And when the climactic 
moment you knew was coming finally arrives, it seems out of place. 
All of a sudden, the characters launch into speeches about how bad 
their lives are. Ringwald's got pressure from her friends, Estevez has a 
domineering father who's trying to regain his lost youth through his 
son, Nelson's home life sucks, Hall is flunking shop class and Sheedy 
is just plain nuts. These monologues should be dramatic or touching, 
but something's missing and I'm not quite sure what. The 
performances are all good, but something in the writing is lacking 
here and in the rest of the movie.
        THE BREAKFAST CLUB has always been touted as one of 
the quintessential teen movies of the 80's and, like I said, I was 
expecting it to be one, but it let me down by combining a predictable 
plot with bad writing. It's also unnecessarily depressing at parts, with 
an ending that's supposed to make up for all the angst-ridden 
arguments. [WARNING: Don't read this part if you don't want to 
know the ending.] Out of nowhere, Ringwald, who has stated 
repeatedly how much she hates Nelson and spent the movie arguing 
with him, suddenly starts making out with him for no reason at all. It's 
almost as contrived as having Ringwald give Sheedy a makeover. 
Suddenly she's a _beautiful_ freak and Estevez likes her. The end.

***
1985, R, 92 minutes [1 hour, 32 minutes]
[comedy/lighthearted drama]
starring: Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Judd Nelson (Bender), Molly Ringwald
(Claire), Anthony Micheal Hall (Brian), Ally Sheedy (Allison), Paul Gleason
(Mr. Richard Vernon), produced by Ned Tanen, John Hughes, written and
directed by John Hughes.
"The Breakfast Club" is a film that is obvious in its intention to make a
statement about the caste system between teenagers, but it does so in a funny
and enjoyable way. The film has a substantial amount of sympahty because the
characters are realistic and believable. Even though it can go a bit over the
top, the script is chiseled with detail and flows very smoothly and you have
to respect that.
The story is very simple: five teenagers from a suburban Chicago high school
must spend an entire Saturday in the school library as a special form of
detention. Mr. Vernon (Gleason), the administrator, lays down the rules and
tells them they better think about what they've done. He's mean and knows he
is, but doesn't care. However, as much of a caricature as the character may
be, Gleason plays the role perfectly as not to make Vernon a simple
easy-to-hate villain nor any type of cartoony character. He simply embodies
everything about adulthood and authority.
As soon as Vernon leaves, 20 minutes of sheer character development through
conversation and arguments start up between the group. There is Andrew
(Estevez), the jock; Bender (Nelson), the punk rebel; Claire (Ringwald), the
princess; Brian (Hall), the brain; and Allison (Sheedy), the kooky loner.
Bender gets the ball rolling by purposely annoying the others. He may be a
punk, but he certainly is clever because he knows how to manipulate everyone.
And so we get conversations that are funny and insightful at the same time.
Hughes is a master of dialogue and although these kids are caricatures, their
conversations are familiar. They argue just because they are from different
"classes" and think they are better than each other.
The film is essentially divided into small interludes, and I was surprised
title cards didn't appear every little bit saying "Hour 1: Bickering," "Hour
5: Confessional." About halfway through the gang has gotten to know each
other pretty well and start to do things to break the monotony. Bender is the
most outspoken of the group as he represents everything teens are not
supposed to be, but when he leads the gang on a risky romp through the halls,
they go along just for the element of risk. Surprisingly, when they are
nearly caught, Bender sacrifices himself to save the others and is then
locked in a closet by Vernon. Maybe some of this sounds a little too
Hollywood, but because the film is so charming it makes sense at the time. 
The final act tries, perhaps a bit too hard, to become a real bonding
experience between the newly found friends. There are emotional breakdowns
(ever character cries at least once) as each admits what "crime" they
committed, and then they realize just how petty their differences are and
wonder why there has to be the caste system there is. 
As good and wholly original as the film remains throughout, the ending seems
a little off. Even though there isn't a plot, I couldn't help feeling
something was left unresolved.
"The Breakfast Club" constantly exhibits subtle elements that could have
been played upon more. Even though this film does have many transparent
elements to it, for the most part they are presented in an original, funny,
and interesting manner. The good points here far outweigh the bad.
