Based on the 1940 book by Richard Wright, the 1951 version of "Native Son" 
(it was remade in 1986 with a Hollywood cast) had difficulty gaining a 
distributor because of its "controversial" subject matter, and eventually 
fell through the cracks. Currently available on video, the film proves that 
times sure have changed, as its supposed-to-be cutting edge look at the 
disheartening state of race relations in the 1930s is almost completely 
undealt with or presented in an effective manner. 25-year-old Bigger Thomas 
(novelist Wright, taking over the film's lead) is a poor, lower-class black 
man who gets a job as a chauffeur for a rich white family. When he 
accidentally kills the intoxicated daughter on his first night of the job, he 
soon becomes a wanted man. Since the underlying themes about race are so very 
mild, basically the film becomes a mediocre "man-on-the-run" crime drama 
without any twists or likably three-dimensional characters to keep your 
interest. Wright, however, gives a fine debut performance.
