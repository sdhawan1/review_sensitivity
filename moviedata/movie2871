**** (out of 4) BESIEGED is elegantly structured and concisely told.
Based on a short story by James Lasdun, it has the feel of a folk tale.
The setting is modern, but the characters and their motivations are
timeless and cross-cultural.
Before I continue, let me say that if you're interested already, go see
BESIEGED before reading this or any other reviews. It's not that the
movie centers around a surprise; it's that the movie's structure and
pace are very part of what's best about it. Knowing too much beforehand
might diminish their impact. Forgive me if the rest of the review is a
little vague as I try not to spoil anything.
Shandurai (Thandie Newton) is a medical student who earns her keep as a
live-in maid. Originally from Africa (from an unspecified military
dictatorship), she is now in Rome.
Her employer is Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), a reclusive English pianist
who rarely goes out and only teaches a few students. He lives alone
(except for Shandurai) in a rich, multistory apartment left to him by
his aunt. Antique statues, tapestries, and paintings adorn his lonely
home. Amid all the beautiful objects, only the black lacquer grand piano
is loved.
BESIEGED'S setup is subtle. It is elegantly arranged so that after about
15 minutes, all the introductory shots and scenes -- from Africa and
from Rome -- click into place. More exposition might have answered some
questions sooner, but Bertolucci's introduction is cleaner, more
succinct, and more forceful.
In this first part, there is an amazing lack of dialogue. Bertolucci
sets the scene without explaining it for the camera. Except for some
incidental dialogue in Africa, nothing is said until Mr. Kinsky abruptly
professes his love for Shandurai.
Kinsky's announcement is sudden and jarring, both to Shandurai and to
the audience. Usually a filmmaker lets you know right away whether a
screen couple will end up together or not. But at this point, the
characters have barely been introduced, and they have hardly spoken to
each other. The first words they share shouldn't be a desperate proposal
of marriage. When Kinsky says he's never felt this way before, it is
easy to believe him. His reclusive lifestyle seems to have deprived him
of the emotional maturity and experience that would have helped him
control his feelings.
Obviously, Shandurai rebuffs him. And to clearly draw the line for Mr.
Kinsky, she tells him that she is married; her husband is an African
prison. Bertolucci captures the awkward moment perfectly, using handheld
camera, slow motion, and jump cuts. (In fact he uses these techniques
throughout the movie to highlight or flit past a moment.) Soon enough,
the moment passes and the two never speak of the incident again.
But the words have been spoken and the can't be called back. Shandurai
tries to forget them by looking for another living situation and
immersing herself in school. Mr. Kinsky is the perfect gentleman,
apologizing once, then acting as though the embarrassing exchange is
completely behind them.
While Shandurai studies, Mr. Kinsky starts frequenting the African
churches. Soon, small things start disappearing from Mr. Kinsky's
apartment, to the surprise of Shandurai. Very slowly, very gradually,
his apartment becomes sparser and sparser. Life goes on, but the opulent
setting is becoming more and more humble. Kinsky never explains where
the rich adornments go, and Shandurai is afraid to ask.
Our suspicions (and Shandurai's hopes) are confirmed when she discovers
a letter in his wastebasket from her country's government in
Africa....
The story of sacrifice is very simple. So simple, in fact, that it
almost sounds like a fairy tale -- like a story once told around
campfires to extended families.
In fact, BESIEGED features an African storyteller. He exists outside of
the story but appears on-camera at key moments from Shandurai's life in
Africa. Perhaps he is the director's shadow, because with BESIEGED,
Bertolucci proves himself a great storyteller.
Bertolucci uses the medium of film to its fullest extent. He slows time
when a moment has weight, and skims through it when a moment is
fleeting. He avoids unnecessary dialogue and SHOWS, rather than TELLS,
when possible. He uses editing to concisely compress time, and to draw
thematic parallels between scenes.
The use of music in this film is wonderful. Rich African rhythms and
harmonies contrast with the luxurious beauty of Kinsky's solo piano
pieces. The musical contrast echoes the differences between the two main
characters. (It's interesting to note that Kinsky's music takes on more
rhythm and life after he visits the African church.) A single jazz tune
in the middle -- "My Favorite Things," appropriately enough -- bridges
the two styles of music and the two halves of the film.
Finally, and most importantly, Bertolucci keeps the actors in an
emotional middle ground, rather than locking them into a strong,
fully-explained passion. This leaves room to interpret words or deeds in
different ways. Does Kinsky love Shandurai or is he merely infatuated?
Does he hope to make her happy or does he hope to win her love? Does she
love him, or is she merely grateful? Different answers could leave
viewers with completely different ideas about what the movie was about.
That's not to say that Bertolucci was being vague. Rather, he was
acknowledging that when it comes to human behavior, there is usually no
single, identifiable motivation.

Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci's films often unfold on a
sprawling canvas (the epic 1900 and the Oscar-winning The Last
Emperor, etc), while others court controversy (Last Tango In Paris).
While some of his works are visually lush, many are also interminably
dull (The Sheltering Sky and Little Buddha, etc).  Bertolucci's latest
film is a far more intimate and personal story, yet it still embraces
many of his favourite themes.
Set in contemporary Rome, Besieged is a poignant tale about
the coming together of two strangers, lonely and lost people, who are
held hostage to matters of the heart.  Shandurai (Thandie Newton, from
Flirting, etc) is a refugee from an African nation in turmoil.  Her
husband, a school teacher and political activist, has been arrested
and detained by the military regime.  Shandurai is studying medicine
at a Rome university hospital, and earns extra money by cleaning the
apartment block in which she resides.  It is while performing these
daily duties that she first meets Kinsky (David Thewlis, the
narcissistic anti-hero from Mike Leigh's Naked, etc), a musician who
eschews the public forum.
Kinsky is infatuated by the beguiling Shandurai, but she is
still haunted by the palpable presence of her husband.  "If you really
loved me, you would get my husband out of jail," she snaps at him one
day.  And slowly but surely, Kinsky proceeds to do just that.  He
begins to sell off his valuable possessions, including his beloved
piano, to secretly negotiate her husband's release.  Shandurai is
ignorant of Kinsky's intentions until the end, when she is ultimately
forced to choose between the two very different men who have become
important parts of her life.  However, Bertolucci cleverly ends the
film on a hauntingly ambiguous, enigmatic but optimistic note, that
forces the audience to draw their own conclusions as to what will
happen next.
Bertolucci directs with remarkable restraint and
understatement, making this allusive, meditative film a surprisingly
powerful and moving experience.  Like a great composer, he slowly
pulls the various elements together for a rewarding emotional
crescendo.  However, many within the audience may find the pacing
rather slow.  Others will be deeply involved in the emotional journey
of the two characters.
The film is held together by the moving, engaging and quite
sympathetic central performances.  In particular, Newton, whose
anguished and painful performance as a former slave was the best
feature of the dire Beloved, gives another wonderful performance of
great vulnerability and depth.  Thewlis is full of nervous mannerisms
and jittery movements that wonderfully capture the energy of a man
uncomfortable and unsure of his place in the world.  The peripheral
characters add colour to the film, although dramatically they add
little.
Besieged has been ravishingly shot by Fabio Cianchetti, whose
use of hand-held cameras gives the story a more intimate perspective.
Music plays an important part in underscoring the emotional heart of
the film, and Bertolucci weaves in everything from classical sonatas
to primitive African rhythms.
Besieged reaffirms Bertolucci's reputation as one of the great 
craftsmen of contemporary cinema.

Starring Thandie Newton, David Thewlis. Rated R.
What we have here is one of that rare breed of movies that can flaunt
both style and substance; visual éclat as well as thoughtful thematic
undertones. Coming to us from the famed Italian director Bernardo
Bertolucci (The Last Emperor, Stealing Beauty), Besieged is an
involving, artful love story and a meditative look at lives lost and
lives gained as one moves to a higher social existence.
The film begins with African folk music, and a young woman named
Shangurai (Thandie Newton) riding her bike along a bumpy road in what
seems to be South Africa. Menacing-looking cars pass her, and before
long she sees her husband, a local schoolteacher, being dragged to jail.
Devastated, Shangurai relocates to Rome (the move happens in a flash: I
missed it), where she becomes a live-in housekeeper for an eccentric
American man named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).
Kinsky falls in love with the beautiful Shangurai and passionately asks
for her hand in marriage, saying that he will do anything to make her
love him, to which she responds "Get my husband out of jail!" The
impeccably well-intentioned Kinsky backs off, and unbeknownst to her
starts a campaign to set Shangurai's hubby free. Evidently, she figures
it out and is shocked, because he sells everything, including his
beloved piano to make his love happy.
The significance of Besieged lies in the transition between Shangurai's
two lives. Her first is the one she led in Africa, and the culture and
memories stick with her. She has trouble letting them go; this is
manifested through music and her faith for her lost husband. And yet as
her life in Rome progresses, she is mesmerized by Kinsky and his
existence until finally, in the ending, their heretofore affair erupts
and leaves Shangurai's previous life outside the front door.
This is at the core of Bertolucci's film, which actually consists of
minimal dialogue. What it does have, however, is visuals aplenty; a
cornucopia of gorgeous images and deft camerawork. Bertolucci has a way
of moving the camera at blazing speed yet having the film flow smoothly.
Watch for this during Shangurai and Kinsky's first main conversation:
the lens moves frantically from one face to the other creating a level
of tension while at the same time maintaining the film's consistently
hypnotic mood and pace.
I liked Thandie Newton (Beloved) as Shangurai, with her achingly
expressive eyes and her trembling yet assertive voice. I likewise
enjoyed the underused David Thewlis in the Kinsky role, although neither
performance will earn any formal recognition because of the lack of
dramatic dialogue involved.
Besieged is a solid, unpretentious arthouse dweller (is there such a
thing?) that doesn't aim very high and hits the target. It's a light
endeavor that doesn't stay with you for long (although the ending is
powerful) but it's nevertheless an effective love story all the while
being a thoughtful meditation on the social differences of life in two
separate worlds.

Fine Line Features
in English and Italian with English subtitles
starring Thandie Newton, David Thewlis, Claudio Santamaria
based on a story by James Landun
written by Bernardo Bertolucci and Clare Peploe
directed by Bernardo Bertolucci
An old African man plucks a tribal instrument and sings in a scratchy
voice.  A woman walks alone down a dirt road, then watches her husband
get taken away to a military prison. A lonely man sits in an enormous
Roman home and plays an intense piece he has just composed on the
piano.
These are but a few of the breathtaking images caught on film in
Bernardo Bertolucci's beautifully made "Besieged". Over many years,
this Italian filmmaker has made a name for himself with exquisite,
emotional films such as "The Last Emperor" and "Last Tango In
Paris". Bertolucci's latest film, "Besieged" is a work of art if I've
ever seen one.
The film stars Thandie Newton, who was robbed of a much-deserved Oscar
nod for her gritty work in the title role of last year's
underappreciated "Beloved", as Shandurai, a beautiful black woman
working as a maid in the home of lonely pianist Mr. Kinsky (David
Thewlis). Shandurai's husband has been imprisoned for unkown reasons,
and she is learning that Mr.  Kinsky is in love with her.
Shandurai tries to shy away from men since she is married (her only
friend is homosexual), and Mr.  Kinsky doesn't push her. The siege
mentioned in the title is a subtle, emotional one. As the film
progresses, Shandurai feels herself falling into Mr. Kinsky's trap.
There is not much plot to speak of in "Besieged", for it is a collage
of incredible images piled on to one another; each one having
ambiguous meaning. The last scene of the film, however, undercuts the
satisying buildup, and will leave most viewers out in the dark.
"Besieged" is a cold film, but an engrossing one. Bertolucci's
attention to detail creates a vivid motion picture.
But as I left the theatre, I couldn't help but want to know more about
each character's background. Shandurai's dark past is barely hinted
at, and Mr. Kinsky has no story at all. There is such a serious
drought of dialogue in this film, that I'm sure Quentin Tarantino
could have made this entire screenplay into a 5 minute film.
But Bernardo Bertolucci's swift hand and Fabio Cianchetti's lucid
camerawork keep "Besieged" real. The very special thing about this
movie is that I'm sure 10 people could walk out of it with entirely
different opinions of each aspect. If you like films that are
unabashedly artsy, then "Besieged" was made just for you.

Directed by: Bernardo Bertolucci
Written by: James Lasdun, Bernardo Bertolucci, Clare Peploe
Starring: Thandie Newton, David Thewlis
Produced by: Massimo Cortesi
The story of a young woman caught between unwanted love from her
employer and a husband jailed in Africa.
    When you strip a love story down to its bare essentials, what do you
have? Funny sing-a-long scenes like in My Best
Friend's Wedding? No. A dorm room filled with pink balloons like in
Patch Adams? Nuh-uh. How about a grotesquely funny
Welsh flatmate like in Notting Hill? Not even close. When you look at
the heart behind a true love story, you are left with two
things; love, either wanted or unwanted, between two people, and the
circumstances that bring them together. While many
supposed romantic films are just chances for big stars to look cute
(think Meg Ryan in Addicted To Love), Besieged is a hard
look at doomed love; no silly sub-plots, no big stars to distract us.
Bernardo Bertolucci's new film is obviously different from
the rest of the pack, but perhaps it is too different.
    The story is simple to tell, but filled with deep emotions.
Shandurai's (Newton) husband gets imprisoned in an unnamed
African nation, and some time later she leaves for Rome to get an
education and a good job. She works as a housecleaner for
Mr. Kinsky (Thewlis), an eccentric pianist, while doing to night school.
Mr. Kinsky rather painfully loves her, something
Shandurai takes in stride, not wanting to leave a well-paying job.
Normally, this is about as much of the plot a critic will tell,
leaving all of the sub-plots and other bits to the viewer to discover.
However, the story of Besieged is so sparsely told that this
is almost all there is to tell; it is left to us, the audience, to
figure out what is going on. Once the film leaves Africa for Rome, the
narrative jumps forward to a point where Shandurai has worked for Mr.
Kinsky for some time. We know this for he is already
deeply in love with her, sending her flowers down the laundry-chute at
one point. The viewer's first conscious thought is "Wait,
when did he fall for her? Who is he and why is she working for him?
Wait, we aren't in Africa any more?".
    This method of story-telling can be useful. Many films explain
everything to you, diluting their story and distracting you from
the action; perhaps the only flaw in Hitchcock's Psycho is the
psychiatrist's lengthy explanation of what is wrong with Norman
Bates in the film's denouement. Other films leave out key pieces of
information, to provide a surprise climax. Several films this
year have used this trick, one to great financial success. Besieged
however leaves gaps in its narrative solely to concentrate on
the important parts. Thus, we have to deduce for ourselves what the
relationship is between Shandurai and Mr. Kinsky.
Making your audience think is not in itself a bad thing, but with a film
as layered and deep as Besieged is, so much time is spent
trying to put together what's happening that many subtleties go
unnoticed.
    Besieged is sparse not only in its narrative, but also in its
dialogue. Whole scenes go by where neither character speaks,
engaging instead in meaningful looks and glances. Had two lesser actors
been chosen for the roles, this lack of speech would
have buried the film. David Thewlis and Thandie Newton are both more
than capable at emoting through facial expressions,
however, creating an electrical tension between them. We hardly know
what Mr. Kinsky's motivations are, yet we are drawn
into the helplessness of his love anyway. The love story itself is a
raw, powerful one that is uncommon in the majority of films
today. Kinsky seems unable to do anything but love Shandurai. He knows
of her past, and of her husband back in Africa, yet
can't stop himself. He makes great sacrifices for her, very noble
sacrifices that threaten to ruin his own life, such is the power of
the emotions running through him.
    Bertolucci uses a filming style that, with the deliberate plot
holes, further serves to distract the viewer. He has chopped
frames out of certain scenes, so that one second out of every third or
so is missing. The result is a jerky, confusing movement
that seems more like art for art's sake than useful. The final effect is
one of consternation with the film. When discussing the film
afterwards, more viewers will be irately discussing the way characters
twitched around the scene than about how well-written
the story was. While no film can please everyone, Besieged could have
earned a lot more fans had Bertolucci laid off on the
flourishes a little. It is a real shame for this is one of the better
love stories I've seen in years.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Upon viewing Bernardo Bertolucci's last film, Stealing Beauty, I figured
him for a dirty old man.  The tight crotch shot on Liv Tyler as the
opening credits rolled and, later, Tyler on all fours licking a mirror
at the request of Jeremy Irons were both dead giveaways.  But it turns
out that with his latest picture, Bertolucci proves that he is a bore as
well as a pervert.
Beseiged (it was actually called The Siege until the Bruce Willis dud
hit theaters first) features a story simpler than can be found in any
bad American soap opera: A wealthy white guy falls for his black maid
who can't reciprocate his feelings because she's married to a political
prisoner.  That's it.
The white guy is Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis, Seven Years in Tibet), the
owner of the palatial Roman home cared for by Shandurai (Thandie Newton,
Beloved).  He sits at home all day and plays the piano, while she
prefers the music of the native land that she has fled.  That's it.
The two hardly share words, let alone anything in common.  On the plus
side, Bertolucci does effectively use the home's dumbwaiter, symbolizing
the social distance between Jason and Shandurai, who performs her duties
in order to put herself through medical school.  And there are some
great shots involving the giant spiral staircase in the massive
dwelling, warmly shot by cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti.  But that's
it.
Hey, at least it's not too long.  (1:30  R for nudity, mild violence,
adult situations and language)

BESIEGED  (director: Bernardo Bertolucci; screenwriters:
Bertolucci/Clare Peploe/story by James Lasdun; cinematographer: Fabio
Cianchetti; cast: Thandie Newton (Shandurai), David Thewlis (Jason
Kinsky), Claudio Santamaria (Agostino), 1998)
The main characters don't speak much, he plays Mozart, Grieg, Bach and
Scriabin on the Steinway piano and she is his black African housekeeper,
Shandurai (Thandie), who doesn't undertand his Western music. She has
fled from an undemocratic African country after her schoolteacher
husband was imprisoned by the military for ridiculing the dictator.
Jason Kinsky (Thewlis) is the Englishman who has inherited from his
aunt, a splendid four-story Rome villa, which has a spiral staircase, a
garden patio, ornate statues and a dumbwaiter. He must be a rich man,
but he spends all his time giving piano lessons to children and pining
after Shandurai, living an almost reclusive existence.
His love for her is expressed in the passion he exhibits on the piano,
and is seen by us through the varied camera angled shots of the kindly
pianist peering down the spiral staircase at his beloved muse, or
looking at her ironing while she is animatedly listening to some African
pop sounds of Papa Wemba on the radio, with the steam coming out of the
iron. The sexual tension is building up-- as we are left to watch the
two quietly go about their household business, seemingly unable to
connect because of all the differences between them.
Shandurai polishes his artifacts, dusts the furniture, and mops his
floors. She is working her way through medical college, where she is an
A student. Her closest friend is a less serious student, Agostino
(Claudio Santamaria), who wants to sleep with her despite telling her
that he's gay.
Jason, wearing a nerd-like smile and displaying an awkward knack for the
art of casual conversation, can't control himself any longer one day and
grabs onto the startled girl, who does not respond to his gestures for
romance. He, in desperation, blurts out that he loves her and that he
will marry her, telling her that he'll do anything for her love. She
surprises him, by responding in an angry tone, that she is married and
what he could do for her is free her husband from prison.
Nothing more is said about that incident after Jason apologizes, saying
he didn't know she was married. But the house gradually becomes empty of
all the artifacts, tapestries, furniture, and finally the piano; and it
becomes obvious to her what Jason is doing. Their contact is now, even
more so, through the solo piano pieces he plays, as through his visits
to a local African church, he is able to learn how to blend in her
African music into his Western.
What is going on inside her, is seen through the marvelously constructed
dream sequences of her in Africa- as a griot, an African musical
storyteller, chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs-
that are very emotionally received by her. This is the kind of
filmmaking Bertolucci does best. There is an element of vague beauty and
mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder.
When she hears that her husband has been freed from prison, she gets
tipsy on a bottle of champagne and tries to write a thank you note to
Mr. Kinsky. When that fails to materialize as she wants it to, she finds
herself feeling a love for him and goes up to his bedroom, where she
finds him sound asleep from a night of drinking. Remaining in bed with
him until morning, when the doorbell rings and it is her husband at the
door, as the picture enigmatically ends, with us not quite sure who she
will remain with.
The beauty of the film lies in the interplay between the two strangers,
unbelievable as their roles are- she is too perfect and overachieving to
be credible and he gives up too much of himself to be considered
anything less than a saintly figure- as they wrestle with their
incomprehensible feelings and desires, struggling to face what is
present in front of them. Strangely enough, their past seems to be
becoming more and more inconsequential. The imponderable emotions of
love are caught in the music, the stunning visual spectacle of the film,
and in the quietude of their personalities. They are reaching out across
man-made barriers to a point where they can't avoid each other anymore,
and must stop being evasive. How this works out, is how hard to say. It
wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of
them. The glib ending didn't help me understand them any better, as it
felt like something was missing from their relationship, something that
either I didn't catch or something that was just left out of their
relationship that shouldn't have been.
Their acting was first-rate and very unnerving, we could see their
thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen; it is ultimately
what makes this film somewhat special.
The up and down career of Bertolucci, is up again after this less than
epic film (actually made for an hour TV program, but lengthened for the
sake of a feature movie). It is the kind of small art story that
Bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent
commercial ventures (Little Buddha, The Last Emperor). That even though
this story was an obvious and abbreviated one, it was still a joy to
see. What the story means, is not tied in with some of the director's
political or psychological ideas of the past. This is more or less a
film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them
tell their story without much help from the script. And it worked out
better than these kind of films usually do, mainly because there is a
power in Bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all
together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him. All
his films are worth looking at, and this one more so than what I have
seen in a long time from him. It sort of grows on you, and seems more
emotionally satisfying the more you think about it.

 Director:  Bernardo Bertolucci
 Writer:  Bernardo Bertolucci, Claire Peploe, story by James
Lasdun
 Cast: Thandie Newton, David Thewlis, Claudio Santamaria
   Whoever said that opposites attract should get out more
often.  Take a gander at couples and you'll see, not
surprisingly, that many look as though they could be twins. 
We tend to be attracted to mirror-images of ourselves, which
gives rise to the trendy psychological thought that affection
for others is little more than self-love, once removed.  Yet
films--like literature and theater--like to portray the dramatic
and not the mundane; conflict and its resolution rather than
flatness.  We need not wonder that writers and those who
adapt their formulations for the screen will seize upon the
unusual.  Hence, Bernard Bertolucci's interest in the allure of
people for their antipodes.  In "Besieged," the great Italian
seizes upon a story of two people who could not be more
different, a couple whose physical closeness leads almost
inevitably to an emotional bond.  Bertolucci, best known for
the opulence he handled in "The Last Emperor" and the
display of howling rebelliousness by Marlon Brando's
character in "Last Tango in Paris" does an about face with
"Besieged," as he believes that film-makers should not repeat
themselves but should regularly break new ground.
   Filming mostly in Rome but occasionally in a ramshackle
village in Kenya, the Parma-born Bertolucci appears in
essence to go back to the roots of cinema, to the age of the
silents when gestures were more important than words,
visuals taking precedence over utterances.  He employs the
universal abstract art of music to bring two utterly diverse
people together, using MTV techniques such as jump-cutting
and step-framing to manipulate time, now slowing down the
drama, now accelerating the action.  While James Lasdun's
story of two unusual people is presumably entrancing, two
gifted actors bring the printed page to remarkable life: David
Thewlis, best known for his off-the-wall role in "Naked," and
newcomer Thandie Newton, whose portrayal as the title figure
in last year's "Beloved" was mesmerizing.
   The story opens in a fictional African state.  Winston, the
husband of Shandurai (Thandie Newton), is arrested by a
team of soldiers and placed in a military prison without a trial
date.  Shandurai, disgusted with the regime, flees to Rome
(she somehow can speak and understand her African
language, Itallan and English) where she enrolls in medical
school and works as a housemaid to a English pianist and
composer, Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).  Kinsky lives in an
elaborate villa which he had inherited from his wealthy aunt. 
The two are opposites in both culture and temperament.  He
is reclusive and friendless, burying himself in the playing of
Grieg, Beethoven, Bach and Mozart, while Shandurai, an
intensely emotional soul with more facial expressions than a
Kathakali dancer, loses herself to the African rhythms of her
native country which she hears on her radio.  They rarely
talk, Kinski settling for stealing glances at his maid while she
casts furtive peeks at her employer.  Mutual silence makes
their few outbursts particularly melodramatic.  In one agitated
scene, Kinsky blurts out his love for Shandurai coupled with
his willingness to do anything for her (he does), while in
another Shandurai shouts, "I don't understand your music!"
as though the great composers of the West emerged from
The Twilight Zone.  Ultimately music becomes their shared
tongue as the composer visits an immigrants' church to take
in the chants of African choral music and later blends African
rhythms into his own inventions.  
   Avoiding the dull, straightforward narrative style, Bertolucci
exploits the hand-held camera to do apply some quirky cuts
to his movie. Given Thandie Newton's intensely photogenic
features, the creative edits convey her moods to us as readily
as if we were clairvoyants literally reading her mind.  Newton
is a stunning performer who bestows cameraman Fabio
Cianchetti with an unobstructed window to her emotions. 
Though we have to suspend disbelief to accept her character
as a medical student running through the rigors of that
training in a language not her own, we accept the bond that
has been formed between these two disparate individuals. 
This is the ultimate majesty of Bertolucci's latest creation.

Although Bernardo Bertolucci's BESIEGED doesn't fit into any standard
genre, perhaps that's the closest way to peg it.  It is a romance,
albeit a highly tentative one, and it's based on a mystery, although one
that's transparently obvious.  As a film overflowing with music and
containing almost no dialog, it might be considered a musical, although
the leads in this 2-person drama don't sing.
Opening to haunting African rhythms, the story starts in Africa.  The
serenely beautiful Thandie Newton plays Shandurai, a medical student who
treats deformed young patients.  On her way to see her husband, a gifted
teacher, army trucks zoom past her.  They're going to put her husband in
a political prison, which appears to be tantamount to a death sentence.
As she watches him being taken away, she loses all bladder control and
urinates profusely.  This surprising image only a few minutes into the
film leads us to believe that the picture may go for maximum shock, but,
quite the contrary, the film is so placid it will likely be sleep
inducing for those who don't like its purposely oblique storytelling.
With its strong sense of place and the importance it places on visual
narration, the picture has the effect of a haunting trance.  The only
recent picture that comes close in tone to it is THREE SEASONS, which is
slightly better.
After the African prelude, the story skips forward to Italy, where the
reserved but persistent Shandurai works as a maid to finance her way
through medical school.  Working in a lavish 3-story house filled with
expensive antiques and artwork, she is employed by a piano teacher, Mr.
Kinsky, who inherited the house and its furnishings from his aunt.
David Thewlis, best known for avant-garde work under director Mike
Leigh's tutelage, plays Mr. Kinsky in a performance that keeps his
emotions in complete check, save a couple of scenes.
Mr. Kinsky falls head over heels in love with his maid, which displeases
her, albeit not quite enough to cause her to leave.  As soon as she
hears of his affection, she rebuffs him.  He asks her what would change
her mind.  "You get my husband out of jail," she yells back at him.
Since he didn't realize she was married, he recoils, and the movie seems
to be over with before it ever really begins.
The rest of the story concerns the modest mystery of how he comes to
help her.  Shandurai, who is otherwise bright, seems to be the last one
to solve this mystery.  The audience can figure out what is happening
immediately, perhaps even before it happens.
This is all of no consequence.  One can either enjoy the movie for its
music and images, or one can't enjoy it at all.  The African folk
melodies and songs are interspersed with lush piano sonatas.  Every few
minutes someone says something briefly, and then the music resumes.  The
camerawork and editing are other joys or distractions, depending on your
inclination.  Points are emphasized, not in words, but by jump cuts,
fast zooms, and slow motion.
A peaceful and beautiful picture, it does have its flaws.  Chief among
these are the missed opportunities between Shandurai and Mr. Kinsky.
One would expect the movie to burst with sexual tension, but, with a
couple of exceptions, Bertolucci seems oblivious to the possibilities.
The other problem with the movie is its length.  It would have made a
perfect 30-minute short film, but, as a full-length motion picture, it
feels stretched almost to the breaking point.
BESIEGED runs 1:30.  The film is in English with some dialog in Italian
with English subtitles.  It is rated R for brief nudity and sexuality
and would be fine for teenagers.
