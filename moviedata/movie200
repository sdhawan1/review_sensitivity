  "Being John Malkovich" is the type of film we need to see more. Today's films
are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas, or those that
have similar themes. Malkovich falls under none of these categories, and it's
quite refreshing to see that occur.
  This strangely provoking story, is actually somewhat understandable. John
Cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time. His wife (Cameron
Diaz) supports the both of them by working at a petstore, which explains the
obscure pets they keep in their apartment. When Cusack finally realizes he
needs to get a job, he finds an ad for a filing clerk. When he reaches the
building, he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor. It's there that he discovers a secret
portal that leads to Being John Malkovich for 15 minutes at a time. Meanwhile,
Cusack meets a business partner (Catherine Keener), in which he falls madly in
love with her. The only problem is, she has no interest in him what so ever. 
  The whole portal thing, isn't just a toy, in fact, it becomes Cusack's dream.
Being inside Malkovich's mind, gave him the opportunity to basically control
Mlakovich, like a puppet, and to fulfill his fantasies. I don't want to give
away too much, but Cusack becomes too attached with his discovery.
  In my opinion, this idea is absolutely brilliant. It's really quite scary to
think that someone could become you, control you, be you. It makes you wonder
why we act like we do, and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out
something out of the blue.
  Even if the script is super sharp, I can't help but find the ending
displeasing. It could have lead up to something more, or at least an amusing
conclusion. It tried to explain a mythology about the portals, that made it
seem rushed. Other than that, I had a very enjoyable time.
  The acting was quite delightful as well. John Cusack has finally been given a
chance to prove his ability, and he does it well. He's by far the most
underrated actor due to a lack of popularity, but I'm hoping that will change.
Cameron Diaz was her usual charming self, although I felt that part was wrong
for her, but she pulled it off. John Malkovich himself continues to creep out
people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice. Who else's mind
would be better to explore?
  The director, Spike Jonze, who appeared in last month's Three Kings really
catches my attention with this project. I knew he was bizzare, but not to this
extreme. He too is likely too receive media attention.
  "Being John Malkovich" isn't an excellent film, but it is definitly
entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite. What's even better is the
film's puzzling message...Am I Nick Lyons?

     Leave aside for a moment -- and you won't hear this out of me very
often -- such mundane questions as what BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is "about," 
or what it "means." It is a rare occurrence when a film so completely
engulfs me in its singularity that I know I'll miss something if I try to
figure it out while watching, but that's exactly what happened with BEING
JOHN MALKOVICH. It's no coincidence that the ad campaign featured music
from BRAZIL; like Terry Gilliam's stunning 1985 film, it's a vision that
begins "somewhere in the 20th century," then takes a left turn into
somewhere inspired and unexpected. For nearly two hours, you can revel in
the pleasure of letting its surreal, subversive humor roll over you in
waves. For hours afterward, you can peel away its layers of significance
and realize how truly extraordinary it is.
     Attempting to distill screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's story into a few
short sentences can't possibly do it justice. Its protagonist is Craig
Schwartz (John Cusack), a struggling street puppeteer at a crossroads. 
Encouraged by his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, coiffed a la early
Roseannadanna) to find a day job until "the puppeteering thing" takes off,
Craig goes to work as a filing clerk for LesterCorp on the 7-1/2th floor
of Manhattan's Mertin-Flemmer Building. Soon Craig discovers two
fascinating things. The first is Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener), a worker
in the Mertin-Flemmer Building with whom Craig instantly becomes
obsessed. The second is a tiny door hidden behind a filing cabinet, a door
that allows anyone who enters to experience 15 minutes through the eyes of
actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich).
     There are so many improbably wonderful moments in BEING JOHN
MALKOVICH that it would be criminal to deprive potential viewers of the
joy of discover. Suffice it to say that Kaufman and director Spike Jonze
(the video and commercial wunderkind making his feature film debut) find a
new and hilarious place to go every time you think they can't possibly
find anywhere more whacked-out than where they've just been. A minor
supporting character like Floris (Mary Kay Place), "executive liaison" to
the company's eccentric boss Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), can steal a scene
with her stone-faced insistence that everyone else around her has a speech
impediment; even the unresolved childhood issues of a chimpanzee can
become a twisted vignette. Every performance is a comedic gem, none more
so than a turn by Malkovich that re-defines "self-deprecating" (even in a
film where his consciousness is the center of the universe). There are
giggles, there are guffaws, and then there is laughter that comes from
sheer awestruck surprise. Guess which kind BEING JOHN MALKOVICH engenders.
     If BEING JOHN MALKOVICH had been nothing more than a blissfully bent
comedy, it still would have been one of the year's best films. Buried
beneath the surface surrealism is an exploration of identity that slides
from the addictive nature of virtual reality to the appeal of performance.
I speculated after the film whether the premise would work with just any
actor -- BEING HARRISON FORD, for instance, or BEING JULIA ROBERTS -- and
I don't think it would. Malkovich's unconventional looks and chameleonic
character acting become one of the film's running jokes (no one can quite
remember what movies they've seen him in), making him the ideal vessel for
a visitor to re-create himself. Craig's despair at his own failures leads
him to believe that his own identity mocks him; a look in the mirror by
his puppet-self leads to an explosion of rage. Playing into the messages
of a culture that convince you someone always has it better, BEING JOHN
MALKOVICH sends Craig on a mission to get what he can't have in his own
life by taking over someone else's. His ultimate fate is the worst kind of
tragedy: an existence over which he has no control at all.
     There's plenty more to BEING JOHN MALKOVICH for those willing to poke
around for a while -- students of Medieval French philosophy may ponder
the significance of Craig casting his own puppet doppleganger as Abelard
in "Abelard and Heloise," considering where he ends up in the film -- the
kind of stuff you just don't expect to find in contemporary film. You
certainly don't expect to find it in a film that's ridiculously
entertaining even if you don't think about it afterward for a second. 
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a kind of pop masterpiece -- funny, insightful,
smart, playful and heartbreaking. Few films provide such a thrilling sense
of discovery, a discovery that lingers from the first frames to subsequent
days.

             Here's a hint at how bizarre this film will become before
the end credits appear: the story starts to take shape around a love
triangle including, not three, but four people. You could probably call
the whole thing a descent into madness; or you could call it an ascent
into the mind of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman.
             Jonze's direction is solid, but not really spectacular. It
keeps a good job of keeping the film together, something which, with the
elements of this film, probably proved much harder to do than can be
imagined. The relative calmness of the direction is the grounding wire
for the unbelievably creative, odd screenplay. This screenplay is one of
the most unique I remember seeing portrayed on the big screen. It would
have been very easy for a director to feel the urge to match the oddity
of the screenplay in his direction (and I'm sure the urge probably came
to Jonze), but Jonze does a magnificent job of keeping himself reeled in
enough that the screenplay does not get lost through misdirection and
confusion.
             So, obviously, I think the screenplay is the driving force
of this film. I can't even imagine the pitch that got this film made,
but somehow they found an executive with the guts to bet on something
new, and, in my opinion, it pays off. From the very first frames of the
film, it is clear that this film will be mostly unconventional. Every
environment is imbued with a bizarre energy that tends to charge the
events of the story taking place there. Every character is eccentric in
some way. Every plot point seems to take you somewhere new. I'd really
like to know what habits were involved in Kaufman's writing. Was it
written in stream of consciousness, then given structure? Does he have
an unhealthy obsession with John Malkovich or did he write it without
anyone in mind, then choose him? Suffice it to say that however he wrote
the screenplay, it works.
             And what of the actors? John Cusack is the lead, and among
the most eccentric characters. Just as Jonze's direction calmly grounds
the screenplay, Cusack seems to calmly ground the other actors around
him. His eccentricity isn't nearly as abrasive as the others, so he
serves as a good center to the story. The best performances were
probably those of Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich, himself. Diaz plays
very much against type, as the mostly unattractive, neglected housewife.
However, she's as eccentric as the rest of them and just becomes moreso
as the film goes on. Her performance has the right amount of subtlety
when needed, as well as excitement. Malkovich not only plays himself,
but variations of himself. The great thing is that he doesn't seem very
self-conscious, something which could have ruined the whole thing. He is
quite willing to make fun of himself as sacrifice for a good film, and,
in the meantime, he finds himself giving an excellent performance.
             It's good to see that such names as Diaz, Malkovich, and
Cusack are willing to make films like this. Hopefully they, and other
stars, will continue to bet on such unique material, allowing other
artists such as Jonze and Kaufman to continue creating such visions.

   Have you ever felt imprisoned in your own body, wishing
that you could go somewhere else like a member of the
witness protection program with a new name, new job and
even a new personality?  Have you ever tried with unfailing
energy to get another person to see things your way: to get
the promotion you want, the romantic attachment you crave,
the organization you've always wanted to join?  How far
would you be willing to go to make money; that is, would you
be agreeable to invading a person's privacy by setting up a
telescope in your office and soliciting fees from people who
want to look into the rooms of the buildings across the street? 
Have you ever wanted to be famous, not just for fifteen
minutes, but to be the sort who'd have to wear sunglasses
just to take a walk around the block lest you be swamped by
autograph hounds?  Finally, have you ever been annoyed by
people who ask you questions like these?
   Chances are good that your answer is yes to all of the
above.  That's the nature of the beast: to want what the other
guy has, to be what the other fellow is, if only for a while. 
There's a movie out there that explores all of these big
themes and does so in ways that make it not only
hands-down the most original cinematic work of the year but
one of the most absorbing, amusing, and thought-provoking. 
"Being John Malkovich" plays around with The Big Issues Of
Our Time And Every Other: Identity, Manipulation, and Ethics. 
That's quite a tall order for a film that's under two hours in
duration, but "Being John Malkovich," one of the favorites of
the recent New York Film Festival, succeeds in doing all this
while combining the genres of science fiction, romantic
comedy, and psychological thriller.  
   Surprisingly, this work of utter singularity comes from the
helmsmanship of a first-time movie director, Spike Jonze,
heretofore known principally for his work as a maker of music
videos and for his role as Private Conrad Vig in David O.
Russell's "Three Kings."  Using the talents of performers who
are easily recognized for their commercial movies--John
Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Charlie Sheen; and those better
known for their employment in the indies such as Catherine
Keener, John Malkovich, Mary Kay Place, and Orson
Beene--Jonze brings Charlie Kaufman's screenplay to vivid,
surreal life.  Though the final one-third of the story becomes
convoluted after the introduction of far too many people,
overall the wit, the novelty, the risk-taking make this a
must-see experience, a welcome change of pace from
Hollywood's diet of predictable, formulaic, feel-good fare.
  The story opens on a dazzling performance of puppetry by
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) whose job offers are too few
and far betweeeen, relegated to second-string status by a
gimmicky puppeteer who draws the crowds to shows
involving a 60-foot tall statue.  Encouraged to look for a job
by his ditzy wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz)--who runs a pet store
and keeps a neurotic monkey in their home--he answers an
ad requesting a fellow with fast fingers for filing.  The office is
on floor 7-1/2, and has a four-foot ceiling--to keep its
overhead low, according to the boss, Dr. Lester (Orson
Bean).  Craig gets the job, begins to flirt fruitlessly with a
co-worker, Maxine (Catherine Keener), and soon has dinner
with his carrot-juice-addicted employer who, he learns, is 105
years old.  (The key to the plot, as we find out later, is that
carrot juice is not the secret of his longevity, but that a
periodic change of identity is.)
   The fun comes partly from dialogue that could have been
stolen from Saturday Night Live, as when Craig attempts to
communicate with a secretary who has a form of dyslexia of
the ear. But most of the amusement is visual.  Craig
discovers a secret tunnel behind a filing cabinet that leads
directly into the head of John Malkovich.  Anyone who crawls
through the passage enters the actor's top, sees life through
Malkovich's eyes, and is spit out in 15 minutes onto a grassy
area overlooking the New Jersey Turnpike.  The plot thickens
when Craig's wife and his co-worker Maxine form a sexual
attachment much to the dismay of the man who wants
Maxine for himself, leading Craig to manipulate events inside
John Malkovich's head to trick Maxine into thinking that he is
really Lotte.
   Themes involving mistaken identity have been milked for
laughs ever since the days of Greek theater, later reinforced
by the Elizabethans before becoming a staple of modern
comedy.  But not even Shakespeare would have come up
with the wild and woolly developments of this parody, which
among other themes tackles the very making of movies itself. 
When Craig finds that his skill as a puppeteer comes in extra
handy in this case, he becomes like a film director,
manipulating John Malkovich to do his bidding.  And when
Lotte takes on the identity of John Malkovich, she assumes
the role of the actor, one who may be mousey in real life but
aggressive and sensual when performing in the guise of a
wholly different person.
   As if the originality of this plot were not enough, "Being
John Malkovich" benefits from some surprisingly adept
acting by people relatively unknown such as Orson Bean
(who had once written a book popularizing the ideas
of psychologist Wilhelm Reich) as the lecherous 105-year-old
boss, and Catherine Keener, who was equally dependable as
the cynical wife of Ben Stiller in Neil LaBute's "Your Friends
and Neighbors."  Cameron Diaz, virtually unrecognizable in a
frizzy brown wig, eschews her usual sexy characteristics and
comes across wonderfully as the frustrated woman who
realizes that she would like to become a transsexual; and
John Cusack is super as the nerdy fellow as frustrated in the
bedroom as in the board room who ultimately overcomes his
helplessness in both areas.  Though many in the audience
may not have seen John Malkovich in other films (he
performed in the arty "Dangerous Liaisons" and is a quirky
man indeed in the upcoming "The Messenger"), few are likely
to forget him after watching him show us that actors, like
normal human beings, eat toast in the morning, become
confused quite often, and are generally at least as vulnerable
as the rest of us.

If you think you've seen it all in Hollywood, you haven't.  If you think
you've seen it all in every actor who ever played himself, you haven't.  If
you think you'll be in for quite a surprise with 'Being John Malkovich', you
will.  This is one of the most bizarre and weirdly obtuse films that
disappointed me at times while it delighted and intrigued me at other points
during its running time.  It almost looks like the paradox found in a Terry
Gilliam film with a profound sense of visual attraction while putting
forward the dark side of human personality.
Set in New York City in the present day, the story concerns itself with a
puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusack).  He is the type who works odd
jobs displaying his art and doesn't have a steady job.  He sleeps late and
lives with his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) who works at a pet store.  Their
apartment is flooded with animals.  The dogs, cats and chimps roam around
freely and they have many other animals around for companionship.  Craig
takes a job working in a most unique place.  An office building has a floor
that doesn't show up on the elevator's button because following the number
is 1/2.  How can you have 1/2 a floor?  The floor is only about 4 to 5 feet
high.  Everyone walks hunched over.  The doors are all miniature size and
the office furniture fits just fine as do the employees, as long as they're
sitting down.  Craig's job will be that of a file clerk.  Since he is a
puppeteer, he has fast fingers and it shows when he's given a test to
perform.  He's hired.  He meets the office tramp, Maxine (Catherine Keener),
who is a foul woman with a witch like personality.  There is a strange
sexual attraction between the two of them which dominates parts of the film.
THE PLOT THICKENS.  Craig is working one day when he drops a file folder
behind the filing cabinet.  Don't you hate that?!  He must move the entire
cabinet out to get the folder.  After sliding the cabinet away from the
wall, he notices a board covering something up.  Curiosity killed the cat as
they say.  After removing the board, there is an old door that seems to have
been abandoned.  Upon opening it and crawling inside, Craig is sucked into
its chamber and looks through the eyes of actor John Malkovich.  The door
turned out to be a portal into the back of his head.  Bizarre!  The only
catch is that just when this experience is getting really exciting (it only
lasts 15 minutes), your body is dispensed from its place and you fall out on
to the New Jersey turnpike.  BIZARRE!  Yes, this is all true.
If it sounds silly and unbelievable, that's the point.  The film drives a
wedge between the boundaries of convincing fantasy and magnifying stupidity.
This is all done with the feeling of inhaling laughing gas.  Needless to say
that actor John Malkovich finds out what is happening and tries to stop it.
You see, Craig and Maxine have started a business where people can enter the
portal for 15 minutes and pay $200 for the experience of being someone else.
Through it all is an explanation provided by the office boss (Orson Bean) of
how the portal works and how people can become transferred from its
perception or be imprisoned by its black hole like draw on human beings.
John Cusack is quite an actor.  He said for years he wanted to avoid the
trappings of a career enjoyed by people like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks or
Harrison Ford.  It other words, super stardom.  He, like Nicolas Cage in the
early days of his career, has instead opted for the quirky roles in
Hollywood.  The off beat stuff and doing a convincing job in any role he
chooses to play.  He is one of the best actors in the business without many
people knowing it and I'm sure that drawing attention away from himself is
exactly the way Cusack likes it.
The two key female performances in the film are 180 degrees apart. Cameron
Diaz is sweet and innocent.  Sort of the naive victim of the whole thing
before her fate is revealed at the end.  Catherine Keener is just the
opposite.  As mentioned above, her portrayal of Maxine is that of a foul
woman with a witch like personality.  You know her character is just the
sort of enigma that will come away without so much as a scratch.  Oscar
nominations will be fourth coming but the film will suffer in the truly high
profile categories such as best picture.  While on many "ten best" lists for
1999, the film has a tailor made look of trying too hard to look original
like 1998's 'The Truman Show' did.  Both films share the concept of
character confinement before the truth is revealed but both show how the
human experience can be dream like in nature and while 'Being John
Malkovich' is a good film with things not seen before, it still seems a bit
aloof in the way its resolution comes down but it will be regarded as GREAT
film making only by the most hard core of fans who like fantasy films.

In a review of "The House on Haunted Hill", I stated that Hollywood was slowly
growing devoid of original ideas. I stand corrected. "Being John Malkovich" has
been called the most original movie of the year by some, but I disagree. It is
the most original movie of the decade. If it had only been trimmed down some
from its 112 minute running time, I would have happily granted it a full five
star rating.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is master of his profession, but it's not a
profession appreciated by the general public. Craig, is a puppeteer. His wife,
Lotte (an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz), is a pet store owner who is
supportive of Craig, but feels he should try something new until his career as
a puppeteer takes off. So Craig aquires a job as a filing clerk on the 7 1/2
floor of a downtown office building. Here he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a
woman he is immediately smitten with. Maxine has no interest in Craig, but when
Craig discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet which leads into John
Malkovich's brain, Maxine partners with him to create a business where one can
buy a ticket for 200 dollars to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes.
Due to the unusual plot at work here, my summary cannot possibly do the film
justice. Suffice to say that nothing like this has been made since Lewis
Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" was turned into a film. In fact, I think
Charlie Kaufman owes quite a debt to Lewis Carroll, and was disappointed at not
seeing his name in the credits as a "special thanks to" mention. Still, I
personally believe that this film deserves a special oscar from the academy
come award time.
The script, which is clearly the high point here, is backed up by such
fantastic performances from the cast that I would be shocked if there were not
at least one oscar nomination amongst them. John Cusack is perfect as the
constantly haggard looking Craig, and Cameron Diaz is hysterical as a woman who
so loves her pet store that she brings all the pets home with her (the
apartment in which they live is filled with iguanas and chimps). However, the
real standout performance here comes from John Malkovich, playing an
exaggerated version of himself. How the man was convinced to play such a
self-effacing role is beyond me.
One last point which deserves mention, is the very brief, but fantastic
appearance by Charlie Sheen as Malkovich's best friend. If there is one man in
Hollywood who really needs a jump-start to his career, it's Sheen, and this
might just do it. His hair, by the way, at the end of the film, has to be seen
to be believed. Also watch for Brad Pitt's quick appearance, which involves him
doing nothing but making an amusing facial expression. As stated, "Being John
Malkovich" runs a little too long, but don't let this stop you from seeing the
most original movie in ages. I give it a well earned four and a half stars, and
a full recommendation.

In Being John Malkovitch, the world is a very strange place. We start to
realise just how strange when struggling puppeteer Craig (John Cusack)
takes a job as a filing clerk on the seven-and-a-halfth floor of a New
York office building. Now that's pretty weird. He has an equally
peculiar home life, sharing his cramped apartment with his wife Lotte (a
remarkably frumpy Cameron Diaz) and half the sick roster from the Bronx
Zoo. That's also pretty weird.
But the Alice in Wonderland factor really kicks into overdrive when
Craig discovers a slippery gloopy portal from his office into the head
of actor John Malkovitch. Now that's really weird. Being in need of cash
to support his puppeteering, he teams up with his smoulderingly sexy and
self-assured co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) to exploit this
metaphysical rollercoaster ride, and they start selling trips into
Malkovitch's head. Craig is keen to point out the serious philosophical
questions that the Malkovitch portal raises, such as issues about the
nature of self, but everyone, including the audience, is having too much
of a wild time to care. When a truly bizarre and hilarious sexual
triangle develops, things get very complicated for Craig and his
concerns shift from the metaphysical to the personal. 
In a wonderfully self-parodying and self-effacing role, Malkovitch
portrays himself as a vain and pompous thesp, and his success as a film
actor is called into question when some characters haven't even heard of
him, and nobody can name any films he's been in. The other performances,
including some surprise guest appearances all as self-mocking as
Malkovitch's, add to the fun.
Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman have concocted an indie
comedy that's wildly original and wildly funny, but it has its dark
side, particularly in Craig's later treatment of Lotte, but never fear -
justice is seen to be done in the end. Like the travellers into
Malkovitch up there on the screen, we're sucked into a fabulous
experience and spat out, exhilarated, at the other end. It all could so
easily have fallen flat after the initial joke wore off, but the quality
of the ideas and the performances sustain interest right to the end,
although as is usually the case with plots based on gimmicky ideas, the
ending can't quite tidy up the story as neatly as we'd like, but that's
being waaayyy too picky. If David Cronenberg and Franz Kafka had got
together to make a screwball comedy, they could hardly have come up with
anything better than this very weird and very wonderful gem.

`Being John Malkovich' is almost too much of a good thing. In all my
experience in motion pictures, I don't think anything as bizarre or
surreal as this film has ever arisen. It's like `Alice in Wonderful'
refitted to an episode of `The Twilight Zone', only far more imaginative
as it propels itself around each new obstacle. It's only when you're
watching that you fully realize how truly unique a spectacle `Being John
Malkovich' is. It's a wonderfully wacky breeding ground of inspired
ingenuity, a film that breaks the originality barrier in a time where
modern movie-making is accused of being nothing but recycled clichés.
`Being John Malkovich' is like one of those elaborate dreams you have
once in a while. The kind where nothing makes particular sense, when all
of your subconscious thoughts combine to form something incredibly weird
- like a dinner party with Abraham Lincoln, with the conversation
starting with `How about those Knicks?' (that's just an example). Writer
Charlie Kaufman must have had one of those dreams to spark this project.
The only other known possibility would be mind-expanding drugs. A lot of
mind-expanding drugs.
John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, an unsuccessful puppeteer looking for
work. Replying to an ad in the classified section, he travels to a New
York City office building where he hopes to get a filing job on the 7
1/2 floor. On this particular floor, the ceiling is only four feet from
the carpet. The secretary at the front desk (played by Mary Kay Place)
doesn't appear to interpret what Craig is saying. The boss, Dr. Lester
(Orson Bean), quizzes him with two separate letters and asks which
arrives earlier in the alphabet (one of the symbols is R' and the other
is a squiggly line). All of this seems very strange to Craig. One day,
while searching for a lost folder behind a cabinet, Craig discovers a
tiny door in his office. The door is a portal that transports you into
the mind of.... actor John Malkovich!! For 15 entire minutes, you are
able to see through the eyes of Malkovich as he eats his morning
breakfast or takes an evening shower. After this brief time has elapsed,
you are spit out through a subconscious loophole alongside the New
Jersey Turnpike.
Interesting, you say. Well, my dear readers, Kaufman's script takes
future twists and turns that are far more relentlessly bizarre than this
central premise. Craig tells the unbelievable story to his estranged
wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is overrun by iguanas and chimpanzees
because she works at a pet store. Also gaining the knowledge of the
Malkovich portal is Craig's voluptuous co-worker Maxine (Catherine
Keener). Together, they concoct this scheme to charge admission into the
Malkovich portal, and soon curious individuals are arriving in droves so
they can try this ultimate amusement park ride out for themselves.
The surprising thing is that there's actually some intricate
thoughtfulness behind the detailed comedy set-up. It's weird, for
certain, but there's also some genuine excitement derived from the
originality of Charlie Kaufman's screenplay. The visual treatment is
breathtaking (such as a scene in which two characters travel through
Malkovich's subconscious), but the real marvel lies behind the audacity
of the script and direction. Spike Jonze, recently seen as the fourth
soldier in `Three Kings', makes his directorial debut after sitting
behind the camera on various MTV music videos. Jonze has a keen eye for
combining both visual and intellectual detail without upsetting the
balance of the picture. It's a wild and outlandish project to handle,
but obviously Jonze was up to the challenge.
The acting (including a colorful assortment of star cameos) is uniformly
superb, but the true grit and style comes from Malkovich himself. Why
John Malkovich? I don't know, but on closer inspection of the
screenplay, he fits the demands perfectly. He's such a wonderful sport
as well. No one in `Being John Malkovich' can seem to remember what
films the actor has appeared in, despite their best efforts. For his
wonderful work here, playing an alternate version of himself from behind
the Malkovich-cam' (which contains astonishing sound effects), the
actor should receive an Oscar-nomination. `Being John Malkovich' can't
quite captivate your attention for it's entire duration, but it will
nonetheless be remembered for it's wild and daring imagination in a time
where modern film is stuck in a rut of monotonous clichés.

     Most of "Being John Malkovich" is such twisted,
through-the-looking-glass originality that you should have plenty of
tolerance to cushion a creative fall-away in the film's declining scenes. 
The premise itself is irresistible: Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is an
out-of-work puppeteer who takes a job at a filing company located on the 7
1/2th floor of an office building, where he and fellow employees must stoop
as they negotiate the 5-foot-high corridors and offices.  There he
discovers a door hidden behind some filing cabinets, and this door leads
into the head of actor John Malkovich, where he can remain for 15 minutes
before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.  
Catherine Keener ("Living In Oblivion") is Maxine, the sexy and
contemptuous co-worker after whom Craig lusts, and with whom he sets up a
business to exploit this phenomenon.  Cameron Diaz, transformed into a
mousy brunette, is his pet-obsessed wife, who also lusts after Maxine after
she sees her through Malkovich's eyes from inside his head.  Orson Bean is
the owner of the filing company, a well-spoken man who is convinced by his
loopy receptionist (Mary Kay Place) that he has an impenetrable speech
impediment.  And Malkovich is Malkovich, and even he finds his way into the
secret portal and into his own head, resulting in a hall-of-mirrors scene
of mind-blowing self-reference.  
Music video vet Spike Jonze directs his first feature brilliantly from
Charlie Kaufman's hilarious screenplay.  The acting suits the warped world
perfectly; Cusack's unkempt obsessive puppeteer, Keener's cold tease of a
vamp (her legs are never together in the movie), Diaz's neurotic,
sexually-ambivalent frump, and Bean's cheerfully eccentric employer are all
inspired creations.  And John Malkovich's blandly compliant version of
himself may be the most weirdly original characterization of the bunch.
The less you know about the plot going in the more fun you'll have. 
Inspiration flags a bit at the end, but it's nothing serious.  The movie
raises a dizzying array of questions about identity, gender, morality, and
mortality; it makes you think while it makes you laugh.

Susan Granger's review of "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH" (USA Films)
 If there's an award for the boldest, most unconventional and
wildly inventive movie of the year, it has to go to "Being John
Malkovich," in which screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Spike
Jonze blend surrealism with science-fiction and self-parody. John
Cusack stars as an out-of-work puppeteer who takes a job as a filing
clerk in a New York office building on the 7 1/2 floor, where the
rents are low because the ceilings are half the normal height. It's a
great visual gag as workers hunch over, scuttling down the hall. Stuck
in an unhappy marriage to an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz with
dark, frizzy hair, he becomes infatuated with a co-worker, Catherine
Keener, who couldn't be less interested. At least until he discovers a
small door behind a filing cabinet that leads to a tunnel which,
inexplicably, sucks him into the brain of actor John Malkovich. Cusack
can see through the actor's eyes and share whatever he's is feeling -
for 15 minutes - until he's dumped into a ditch on the New Jersey
Turnpike. When he shares his discovery with Keener, she immediately
sees the potential in selling entrance - $200 per person - to this
portal so that others can partake in the sensory and emotional
experiences of John Malkovich. They become partners in this commercial
venture - until, inevitably, the enigmatic Malkovich discovers how
they've opened this "metaphysical can of worms." Plus, there's a
deliriously mad subplot of gender/blender sexual seduction, absurdist
supporting gems from Orson Bean and Mary Kay Place, plus witty cameos
by Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, and Brad Pitt. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Being John Malkovich" is a clever, outrageous 10. It's a
film of astonishing and beguiling originality.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Even if you know the premise of Being John Malkovich before you see it,
the story will still seem very odd.  The idea is simple  a struggling
puppeteer takes an office job and finds a portal to John Malkovich's
brain behind a filing cabinet  but it's still quirky enough to dance
circle after circle around its unoriginal competition.  The film is a
daringly creative, visually stunning and wonderfully acted fantasy.
The film opens on a blue curtained stage, where a marionette performs an
intricate dance before what sounds like a very receptive audience.  We
soon learn that the puppet was created in the image of its maker and
operator, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, Pushing Tin), that the stage is
located in his workshop and that the crowd noise was just a tape.  An
incredibly gifted but tormented puppeteer, Craig is unable to find work
in the dummy business and is often reduced to working for spare change
on the streets of New York.  He claims that the puppet business shuts
him out because he `raises issues.'
Although Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, There's Something About Mary)
has a full-time job at a pet store, he can no longer afford to wait for
his big break in puppetry.  One day, while perusing the employment
notices, he finds an ad for a local business that is looking for a man
with fast hands.  Thinking this could be the best opportunity to earn
some cash and keep his digits in shape, Craig heads for LesterCorp, but
doesn't bother to cut his Jesus-hair, shave or even change his clothes.
This is when things begin to get weird, as Craig enters LesterCorp's
building only to find it listed in the lobby directory as being located
on Floor 7˝.  There is no elevator button for 7˝, which presents an
immediate problem.  Then, when Craig finally makes it onto 7˝, he finds
a hallway with ceilings only five feet high.  But the furniture and
people are full-sized, which makes everything seem very Alice in
Wonderland-ish.
Craig gets his job  speed filing  and immediately begins working for
his new boss, the 105-year-old Dr. Lester (professional game-show
panelist Orson Bean) and his hearing-impaired `executive liaison' Floris
(Mary Kay Place, Pecker).  His orientation consists of a videotaped
history of his employer's compact floor, where he meets and instantly
falls for the lovely Maxine (Catherine Keener, Your Friends and
Neighbors), before eventually finding the entrance to Malkovich's brain
after accidentally dropping a file behind a cabinet.
Once in Malkovich's brain (Malkovich plays himself), you see things as
he does for fifteen minutes before being shot out of the sky somewhere
over the New Jersey Turnpike.  One of the film's true joys is the
excitement people have about the sheer banality of the famous actor's
life, whether its eating toast or ordering linens.  By the end of the
picture, Craig is able to control Malkovich like a giant puppet, in the
only predictable facet of the inventive story from debut scribe Charlie
Kaufman, who also served as an executive producer.
Aside from the highly original script, kudos must be given to multi-MTV
Video Award winner Spike Jonze, who has made a rather auspicious feature
film debut, and cinematographer Lance Acord, who filmed the equally
creative Buffalo '66.  The acting is fantastic, especially Cusack and a
nearly unrecognizable Diaz, and Malkovich (The Man in the Iron Mask)
appears to have a grand time making fun of himself.  Look for cameos
from Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and a very funny Charlie Sheen.
If you're looking for something daringly original, do not miss this
film.  If you liked Runaway Bride, you should probably stay away.
Really far away.

Craig (Cusack) is an unemployed puppeteer married to animal 
loving Lotte (Diaz).  Their house is a menagerie.  Craig is a 
good puppeteer, but his choice of material is bizarre and gets 
him beat up.  He finally caves in and looks for a job, 
following up on a peculiar ad for fast fingered, small 
statured people.  He reports to the 7 1/2 floor of an office 
building (the explanation how it got to have 7 1/2 floors is 
one of the film's funnier moments) and, after a bizarre 
conversation with a receptionist (Place) who can hear nothing 
correctly, gets the job.  In a few days, he makes two 
discoveries:  Maxine (Keener) with whom he falls desperately 
in love with and a door in his office which is a portal into 
John Malkovich's brain.
Things get increasingly complicated as Maxine wants to cash in 
on the portal, Lotte meets and also falls in love with Maxine, 
and Malkovich catches on to what is happening.  And then 
there's Lester (Bean), the mysterious businessman who hired 
Craig and may know more about all of this than anyone suspects.
The first half hour or so of this film is full of sly wit.  Not 
laugh out loud sight gags, but really funny moments that you 
have to pay attention to enjoy fully.  They range from Craig's 
bizarre puppetry, to the story behind the animals in Lotte's 
menagerie, to the story of the 7 1/2 floor, and finally to 
Maxine's very funny first date with Craig. But the final hour 
and a half is quite a disappointment.  Oddly, the film slows down
when we get into Malkovich's head.  It stops being a wacky comedy,
and that's certainly what this film should be, and tries to be 
a philosophical film with moments of humour.
Even that might have worked had the movie hit the right
philosophical note.  But it errs there.  Craig briefly discusses
the significance of having access to another person's brain and 
the responsibility of having such access.  Maxine ponders the
issue of being loved by two people and yet attracted to neither
alone and one only when within Malkovich.  Issues of gender
identity are briefly touched upon.  But the most interesting
issue that could have been raised, the issue of whether it is
right to sacrifice one person to save many others, is never even
mentioned.
I know many critics have praised this as one of the best movies
of 1999.  But I cannot understand why.  This is a moderately
funny film that never gets as surreal as its topic would allow
it to.  It's a film with a strong point to make which it never
makes.  It's a film with good actors giving good performances
for a failed cause.  It's worth watching, but not worth all the
hype.

Three things I learned from "Being John Malkovich": when getting on
the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a
building, always bring your crowbar; don't stand in the way of your
wife's actualization as a man; and, whenever entering a portal into
the mind of another human being, wear old clothes, because, hey, it's
muddy in there.
"Being John Malkovich" is the most original film to come down the pike
in a very long time. Wildly surrealistic, yet presented in a
down-to-earth, funky style, this is the kind of movie that sticks in
your head. After savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline,
you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it. From the
ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature
of identity itself, there's a lot to think about here.
Just don't forget to have fun. Clearly, all parties involved in the
making of the film certainly did, starting with writer Charles
Kaufman. "I wrote 'Being John Malkovich' without an outline," he
explains in the press notes, "blindly, with no sense of direction or
purpose. It's important to me that I don't have a map before I
start. This allows me to surprise myself, stay engaged, discover
things, and, hopefully, allow the unconscious to surface."
Spike Jonze (Mark Wahlberg's naďve buddy in "Three Kings") takes it
from there. The white-hot director of the Beastie Boy's "Sabotage," an
award-winning parody of '70s TV cop shows, as well as numerous other
music videos and commercials, eschews typical MTV flash for his
feature film debut. Jonze wisely realized that a storyline this
unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style. His flat,
matter-of-fact approach works perfectly.
And then there's the cast. John Cusack plays control freak Craig
Schwartz, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents
objecting to his remarkably expressive, but decidedly erotic puppet
shows. Over the years, his marriage to obsessive pet store employee
Lotte (Cameron Diaz) has devolved. Once passionate lovers, the two are
now little more than courteous roommates.
Financially strapped, Craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk
at LesterCorp, located on the 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan
Building. Navigating around Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), his 105 year-old
boss and Floris (Mary Kay Place), Lester's dotty secretary, Craig
tries to settle into his new position, but two things keep him
distracted. First, there's the beautiful and imperious Maxine
(Catherine Keener), who delights in tormenting Craig over his obvious
lust for her. And then there's the hole behind the file cabinet, which
turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich. Craig
learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the
subconscious of Malkovich, where they can experience life from his
point of view (with enough concentration, you can even influence his
actions). After 15 minutes, the visitor gets ejected and
unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the New Jersey
turnpike.
By the way, if you're concerned that I gave away too much of the plot,
rest assured - - I barely scratched the surface. One of the most
satisfying aspects of the fable is that Kaufman is not content to
simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up. Instead, he crawls into
the dark premise as completely as Craig crawls into Malkovich,
rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical
implications of compromising another person's identity. He also
examines the consequences of the Malko-visits to Craig, Lotte, Maxine
and, of course, John Malkovich himself.
The performances are superb. Malkovich (best known to mainstream
audiences for his work in "Dangerous Liaisons," "In the Line of Fire,"
and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure "Con Air") tweaks his
own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn. Far from his effete,
vaguely reptilian persona, this Malkovich is just another schlub,
drinking with his pals and trying to get laid (incidentally, Charlie
Sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad
boy reputation).
As always, John Cusack nails his part, handily pulling viewers along
even as Craig's actions become unconscionable. The big surprises come
from Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, both playing against
type. Kenner, usually cast in icy subordinate roles, is terrific as a
highly intelligent, extremely manipulative femme fatale. Cameron Diaz,
barely recognizable under a mess of brown, curly hair, sheds her
perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into
extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in Malkovich.
"Being John Malkovich" stumbles towards the end, as Jonze and Kaufman
try too hard to resolve the various subplots. Additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered
finale. Regardless, this contemporary "Alice in Wonderland" is a real
treat. I enjoyed watching "Being John Malkovich," but only later,
after reflecting on the film, did its resonance fully hit me. At one
point, Craig says, "Do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this
portal is?" Truer words were never spoken.

It's unusual, but every once in a while there comes a movie that is utterly
unpredictable, one that starts with an idea and takes the viewer off in
every possible direction. "Being John Malkovich" is one such film. So often
we see movies that start off with a good idea and go absolutely nowhere,
getting lost in a predictable plot and contrived sitcom-friendly situations.
Not this one. This film explores every possible angle that could be derived
from its admittedly bizarre premise. The film is a funny, entertaining,
thought-provoking original. It's truly amazing this film actually got made
with studio backing, considering it's practically unmarketable.
Nevertheless, "Being John Malkovich" is here, and we're all better off for
it. It's the most creative film of the year.
John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, an out-of-work puppeteer who longs for
the chance to become famous through his craft. Pushed by his wife Lotte
(Cameron Diaz) into getting a steady job, he becomes a filing clerk for the
company on the 7˝ floor (don't ask). While working in his office, Craig
discovers a portal in the wall that leads into the head of John Malkovich,
allowing him to see through the actor's eyes for fifteen minutes. Craig lets
Maxine (Catherine Keener), a co-worker he is attracted to, in on the secret.
The opportunistic Maxine convinces Craig to turn the portal into a tourist
attraction, and it becomes a huge hit. Complications ensue when Lotte visits
Malkovich's brain while Maxine is seducing him, and the two women find they
are attracted to each other . . . but only through Malkovich. The situation
grows ever more bizarre when Malkovich himself realizes what has been going
on, and Craig learns how to control his new "puppet."
This film takes a lot of chances, the biggest of which may be in taking its
most marketable stars and robbing them of their glamour. Cusack and Diaz
play so far against type that I was barely able to recognize them (it took
me 20 minutes to realize Diaz was even in the movie). Both actors acquit
themselves nicely. Cusack's bemused nature is perfect for the part of Craig,
and Diaz delivers an unexpectedly touching performance as his homely wife.
Catherine Keener, so wasted in "8mm," plays the femme fatale to delicious
perfection-every one of her lines drips with contempt for the smitten Craig.
As for the title character himself, Malkovich must first be given credit for
his willingness to go along with such a self-deprecating premise, and then
given accolades for a truly brilliant performance. The actor begins by
playing what is supposed to be himself, but seems more like a composite of
how the general public pictures him. He must then pull off something even
more difficult, which is to take on the personality of whoever is inside his
head. When Craig learns to control his body, Malkovich makes a notable shift
into playing John Cusack. He does it so well that I eventually forgot he was
acting; it really seemed like John Cusack inside John Malkovich. It's most
likely the best work he has ever done.
The screenplay, by Charlie Kaufman, is quite simply one of the most
inventive and clever screenplays to be released in a long while. "Being John
Malkovich" has a seemingly endless supply of clever ideas and jokes. It has
hilarious sight gags, like the "half-floor" Craig works on that causes
everyone to stoop down constantly, a fact most of Craig's coworkers seem
blissfully unaware of. There are classic supporting characters, like the
lecherous old Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), who believes he has a speech
impediment because his secretary (Mary Kay Place) mishears everything said
to her. Numerous self-parodying cameos by Hollywood stars (Charlie Sheen,
Brad Pitt, Sean Penn) crop up, each more surprising than the last. The
laughs come consistently in "Being John Malkovich," and best of all, they
are of the subtle and intelligent variety. The film unapologetically resides
in the absurd for its entire running time. If you're willing to buy into its
skewed sense of reality, you'll have a great ride.
What's truly most admirable about this film is that it doesn't shy away from
any exploration of its central idea. There are countless issues raised by
and possible ramifications resulting from entering another man's head, and
"Being John Malkovich" eschews conventional (read: formula) movie plots to
explore all of them. A less ambitious film might have gone for sappy
sentimentalism or cheap jokes with a predictable story, but this one
actually surprised me fairly consistently. I was never certain where the
story was going, and I loved discovering it. Nearly any pressing question
about the premise one might ask is explored. For example, what happens if
someone learns to control Malkovich? What if Malkovich went inside his own
head? What if more than one person takes control? What if there are others
who have people inside their heads? Most films might only explore one or
fewer of these possibilities. "Being John Malkovich" explores all of them.
There are plenty of mind-bending issues raised by the film that it is sure
to become the topic of many a late-night dorm room conversation. It raises
questions about the nature of celebrity, and why we are fascinated by them.
(Perhaps the film's best joke is that no one can name one of Malkovich's
films, even though everyone recognizes him.) It raises issues of
self-identity and role-playing. (Is it a coincidence we are sent into the
brain of an actor?) It raises issues of homosexuality and sexuality in
general. In fact, there are so many pressing ideas brought up by this film,
it would be pointless to try to list them all. I'll just leave it at this:
After seeing "Being John Malkovich," it's hard to figure just who is pulling
anyone's strings, including your own. A film that can accomplish that is
definitely doing something right.
A film as creative as "Being John Malkovich" doesn't get made very often. It
's funny, inventive, and unpredictable. It may have some difficulty reaching
mainstream audiences because it's so far "out there." After all, this film
takes place in a distorted reality, one in which people don't find the
concept of going into someone else's head remotely unusual. All they see it
as is a business venture, or a new toy. Some may find this hard-to-swallow,
but the removal of what might have been used as an easy comic device helps
make the issues that much clearer. Whatever one may think of it, "Being John
Malkovich" is probably the most original film to be released through
Hollywood in the past few years, and it's definitely a must-see.

Over the past couple of months there have been many comedies that poke fun at
movies, Hollywood, and celebrities. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut was a
brilliant satire on the MPAA and how movies affect our children. The Muse was a
great comedy about a writer losing inspiration to write in the rough town
called Hollywood. Finally, Bowfinger was a movie all about a group of people
trying to make it big in Hollywood by putting a big star in their film. None of
these films go anywhere near the fun that is Being John Malkovich. Throughout
the film one can’t help wondering how writer Charlie Kaufman came up with
these endless plot twists and classic funny moments. Finally we have been shown
a movie that makes fun of the celebrities that we know and love.
Craig Schwartz (Cusack escaping his usual cute boyishness type of role) is an
out of work puppeteer who’s desperately failing in his career. So he decides
to take a job filing at Lestercorp, a company that is on the 7 1/2 floor of a
local office building. All of the ceilings where he works are only 5 feet high.
The owner of the company, Dr. Lester (Orson Bean) thinks he has a speech
problem and that no one can hear him. Because of this, he always seems to be
telling everyone his sexual fantasies in gory, graphic detail. The biggest
surprise of them all is yet to come.
Do you know who John Malkovich is? Some people don't, some people do. John
Malkovich is the popular actor who has appeared in several films including Con
Air, In The Line of Fire, and Dangerous Liaisons. He also certainly didn’t
star in a movie in which he was an art thief. (Inside joke that you will get
after seeing the movie.) What does this have to do with the movie you ask? Read
on...When Craig moves a file cabinet out from the wall to pick up something he
dropped he discovers a small wooden door. If you open the door, and crawl down
a long dark brain-like cave you will become John Malkovich for 15 minutes at a
time. Then you are dropped from the sky into a ditch on the side of the New
Jersey turnpike. Seeing this as a way to get a bitchy co-worker (Catherine
Keener) who absolutely detests him, to like him, he shows his secret to her.
Craig doesn't seem at all troubled about his attraction to her because he's
beginning to think that his wife loves animals more than she loves him. 
I can only set up the basic plot because I want you to go and see this
masterpiece for our time on your own. In fact, you must go now to the theater
and see this film precisely after you read this review. That is not a
suggestion, that is a command. Diaz is great (I love her frizzy hair) as the
confused wife who is having questions about her sexual identity. Catherine
Keener is also funny playing a character somewhat like Karen from the
television show Will & Grace. The real standout though is John Malkovich
himself, not only is the fact that he agreed to do this amazing he takes on the
different aspects of the people inside of him very well. This is an amazing
experience that cannot possibly be described in any shape way or form. So stop
listening to me, go to the theater now and see the most original film of the
year, and certainly one that will make my top ten list. The masterpiece Being
John Malkovich gets **** stars.

1999 has been a good year for the movie industry. We've seen some new
techniques (The Matrix, Fight Club), new style (Blair Witch Project),
virtual stories (The 13th Floor), even indie movies (Go). But only one film
is a real mixture of everything new and the surprises of 1999, Being John
Malkovich.
Directed by well-known music video director Spike Jonze (he directed
Weezer's Buddy Holly, one of my favorite clips) and written by Charlie
Kauffman, this movie goes deep into the question of identity from the eyes
of a real (and I mean real as in non-fictional) identity without losing the
humor and without being too educational.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer. He likes being a puppeteer,
because he likes the idea of being somebody else, of controling something
else. But like any other puppeteer he doesn't have a job, because "who would
want a puppeteer in this wintry economy?". He lives with his wife, Lotte
(Cameron Diaz in baggy pants, oversized sweaters, and ugly hairdo) who works
in a pet store and has too many pets at home, including a chimp that can
experience flashbacks subtitled in English.
To support his family, Craig finds a job at Lestercorp, located at the 7 1/2
floor of Mertin-Flemming building. Low overhead means lower cost. There he
meets attractive Maxine.
One day at his job, Craig found a portal leading to the brain of John
Malkovich for 15 minutes, and then coming out on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Craig was fascinated with this experience of being someone else, especially
a celebrity, because in modern day society, everybody wants to be a famous
celebrity. He tells this to Maxine and Lotte. Maxine wants to sell it for
$200 per person, while Lotte went straight in it and became addicted. She
even felt transsexual after her experience, questioning the whole idea of
sexual identity.
The three are tangled in a bizzare love triangle, with John Malkovich being
the host. John Malkovich himself finally found out about this portal, but
Craig could manage to be longer than 15 minutes inside John Malkovich. As
Craig takes over John Malkovich, he and Maxine take the opportunity to
become famous. And as the end comes near, we see that being a celebrity
becomes a bit boring after a while.
The whole concept of being somebody else in this movie is so very well
portrayed, including shots from John Malkovich' eyeview. The choice of John
Malkovich as the celebrity to enter is perfect. He is famous, but not as
highlighted as other big stars such as Brad Pitt or Pamela Anderson.
Everybody knows him, but not at first sight.
A wonderful movie, this one will be remembered as a breakthrough movie. And
we can sure expect more from Spike Jonze.

Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) answers an ad for a file
clerk with "fast hands."  When he arrives at the building for his job
interview, Craig finds that the company is located on Floor 7˝.  This floor is
half the height of any other, so Craig (and everyone else) has to walk hunched
over.  During orientation, Craig meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), an alluring
woman whom Craig pursues despite being married.  
When one of his files drops behind a cabinet, Craig discovers a small door.  He
goes through it, crawls down a tunnel, and is flung into the mind of John
Malkovich.  Craig experiences the world as Malkovich for fifteen minutes and
then falls from the sky into a ditch by the New Jersey Turnpike.  When he tells
Maxine about his adventure, she sees the potential for profit.  They form a
partnership to sell rides through the portal.
When Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) takes the trip, she emerges questioning
her gender identity.  Hearing this, the enigmatic Maxine gets the hots for
Lotte and arranges to have a dangerous liaison with Malkovich when Lotte is in
his head.  Jealous, Craig plots to insert himself into Maxine and Lotte's
relationship.  Malkovich becomes, essentially, a strap-on dildo in a bizarre
love triangle.
"Being John Malkovich" is the long-awaited feature debut of director Spike
Jonze, who made a name for himself directing music videos for groups such as
the Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth, and Weezer.  The film lives up to expectations. 
Jonze's style is inventive and appropriately whimsical but doesn't draw undue
attention to itself.  Traveling down a rabbithole in the sky, Jonze offers us a
postmodern, post-Freudian Wonderland.  Particularly good are sequences in which
Malkovich goes down the tunnel to confront a universe of himself and another
where Lotte and Maxine rush through Malkovich's subconscious.
Charlie Kaufman's intellectually rich script offers the viewer much to ponder
but demands little.  You can enjoy it on it most basic level and have a very
good time.  However, the movie also creates the opportunity for deep thought
and discussion about identity and states of being (discussions probably best
undertaken with the mind-altering substance of your choice).
Among the cast, Malkovich and Diaz give especially strong performances.  While
most of his previous characters are calculating and creepy, Malkovich is
surprisingly warm and sympathetic as himself.  He's also not afraid to engage
in physical comedy in scenes where Craig takes control of his body.  Best known
as the alluring Mary about which there was "something" that drew men to her,
Diaz is cast against type as the plain wife Craig forsakes for Maxine, who
seems to have that "something."  (Even Lotte falls for her.)   Diaz manages to
bury her glamorous image and bring the complex Lotte to life.
So . . . why Malkovich?  The movie stresses that the thrill of the going
through the tunnel is being someone else-anyone else.  That John Malkovich is a
famous actor is unimportant.  In fact, judging from the characters in the
movie, Malkovich isn't all that famous; Maxine has never heard of him, and
Craig can't name any of his movies.  If we took a poll of actors people would
like to be, John Cusack and Cameron Diaz would probably place much higher than
their titular co-star, but the relative obscurity of Malkovich is just part of
the wonderful quirkiness of this film.
Look for cameos by Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, and Brad Pitt as themselves. 
Sheen's first appearance is one of the movie's funniest scenes.
Bottom line:  Fresh and inventive, "Being John Malkovich" is a delight to the
eyes and to the mind.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Being John Malkovich
Rated [R], 112 minutes
Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener,
Orson Bean, Mary Kay Place and John Malkovich
Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman
Directed by Spike Jonze
website: www.beingjohnmalkovich.com
IN SHORT: A great film. Like nothing you've ever seen, or even conceived
in your wildest film fantasy dreams. . .
Unless you dream of Cameron Diaz as a plain Jane, frizzy haired brunette
who is bound, gagged and locked in a cage with a diaper wearing,
psychologically damaged chimpanzee named Elijah while her puppeteer
husband inhabits John Malkovich's head as said actor has sex with said
husband's business partner and lust object. . .
Way beyond anything conceivable, right? Once again the pairing of a
first time screen writer (Charlie Kaufman) and first time big screen
director (Spike Jonze) have floored this critic. Being John Malkovich
works so brilliantly that every outlandish gag or situation makes
perfect sense. The hard part for me is figuring out how much to tell you
without a) spilling too much and b) sounding like I'm out of my mind for
recommending something that sounds insane.
>From the opening titles, in which you see puppets manipulated in ways
that are physically beautiful and poetic, to the matter of fact
introduction of a building with a 7½th floor and beyond, almost
every scene in Being John Malkovich pushes the envelope in how it tells
its story. Jonze, best known as a video director, doesn't let his vid
chops get in the way of telling the story. Kaufman manages story
elements that are so disparate that you never figure out how they relate
to each other until it's too late.
We start with puppeteer Craig "not based even remotely on anyone in
Cranky's birth family ", Schwartz (John Cusack), who demonstrates
notable chops with his string-ed creations. Problem is, his puppet plays
use themes that are classic and very adult and, well, parents are more
likely to pop him one in the mouth than put coins in his beggars bucket.
The breadwinning part of this basement apartment inhabiting pair is
Lottie (Cameron Diaz) who works in a pet shop and provides tender loving
care to the wounded, traumatized and otherwise deficient animals she
brings home. Needing cold hard cash, Craig takes a job as a file clerk
in the LesterCorp office on the 7 ˝ th floor of Manhattan's
Mertin-Flemmer office building.
There's a very funny joke hidden in that last piece sentence, made even
funnier in the film as Kaufman's script makes no effort to milk it for
all it is worth. Most of the jokes and absurdities in Being John
Malkovich are laid out in a matter of fact style that, if you go with
the proverbial flow, you'll find yourself sucked into the hilarity of it
all.
That needs more explanation: One day at work, Craig drops a file behind
some cabinets. After moving them, he discovers a boarded up doorway in
the wall, with a tunnel on the other side of it. The tunnel, gooey messy
thing that it is, transports Craig into the mind of John Malkovich,
actor, 2 time Academy Award nominee and so on and so forth. After about
fifteen minutes of FirstPersonPOV, Craig gets ejected from JM's head and
dumped on the side of a highway in New Jersey.
Lust Object Maxine (Catherine Wheeler), who is attractive to both men
and women and knows it, also works on 7 ˝ . Craig, smitten, reveals the
existence of the "portal". Maxine writes up a business plan, getting
real folks to pay $200 a pop for the opportunity to experience life from
the first person point of view of Malkovich. The money comes rolling in.
Maxine also seduces the real victim, Malkovich who, when he gets wind of
the scheme, goes headfirst down the tunnel. What John Malkovich sees
while "being" John Malkovitch is so blisteringly funny that . . . well,
that's all you need to know. The movie still has an hour to go, with a
pair of love triangles yet to come. It gets better all the way to the
end.
Outstanding in supporting roles are Mary Kay Place as LesterCorp's
receptionist, who suffers from what can only be called dyslexia of the
ear and Orson Bean as her horny as hell, 105 year old boss. [The first
words out of Bean's mouth when he sat for CrankyCriticŽ StarTalk were
"betcha thought I was dead!" -- click for more with Bean, Malkovich,
Cusack, Diaz (and the rest...)]. Across the board,
performance and script and direction are all noteworthy
The next time Barry Diller buys a down on its luck company, Cranky's
gonna buy stock. USA Films hasn't had a major dud yet, and it's getting
so bad their publicists are laughing at me when I come calling, saying
"You're not so Cranky!" I hate that . . .
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Being John Malkovich, he would have
paid...
Oscar nomination level. Yeah, you'll be seeing this level as we get
closer and closer to statue time. We rarely see one film a year that
sets a new high mark or, to use a cliche, breaks the mold. Being John
Malkovich is the second of this year. Unlike "Run Lola Run," no
subtitles are required.

BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (M).  
(Polygram/Universal/UIP)
Director: Spike Jonze
Stars: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich,
Mary Kay Place, Orson Bean, Charlie Sheen, W Earl Brown, Carlos
Jacott, Willie Garson, Byrne Piven, Gregory Sporlender, Reggie Hayes
Running time: 113 minutes.
Rarely have the ideas of a writer and the creative vision of a
director been so in synch as with this delightfully off beat and
surreal black comedy about an out of work puppeteer who discovers a
mysterious portal into the head of actor John Malkovich.  What is even
more surprising is that Being John Malkovich is the first feature film
from both writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze, better
known for his rock video clips for artists such as the Beastie Boys,
Fat Boy Slim and REM.
Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is pushed
into finding a real job by his animal loving wife Lotte (an
unrecognisable Cameron Diaz).  He ends up working as a filing clerk
for a firm buried away in an office stranded on the legendary 71/2
floor, located halfway between the seventh and eighth floor of a city
office block.  One day he discovers a boarded up door behind a row of
filing cabinets.  Intrigued he enters the door, only to find himself
inside a tunnel that somehow transports him into the head of noted
American thespian John Malkovich (Dangerous Liaisons, etc).
When he tells his colleague Maxine (a perfectly bitchy
Catherine Keener, from 8MM, etc) about the secret portal, she decides
to turn it into a business and charge people for the rare opportunity
to enter someone else's mind.  An unusual sexual triangle also
develops between Schwartz, his wife Lotte and Maxine, with Malkovich
himself reluctantly caught in the middle.
Malkovich even proves that he is a good sport with his
enthusiastic participation in this film.  When he was offered the
script, Malkovich could easily have run the other way, but instead he
sends up his normally intense and serious persona with rare relish.
The scene in which Malkovich uses the portal to enter inside his own
head is the most outlandish moment in a film crammed full of unusual
ideas, outrageous plot elements and unexpected developments.
Unfortunately not everything in the film is completely successful, and
some moments fall a little flat.
Being John Malkovich is a film of dark comic genius that asks
audiences to consider what they would do if they could be someone
else, even if only for fifteen minutes at a time.  Kaufman's absurd
but sharp and cleverly written script draws a potent link between sex,
power and manipulation, but there is also something of a nasty streak
to its eccentric sense of humour.  Given its bizarre premise, this
decidedly quirky comedy could have been a first class disaster, but
first time director Jonze handles the material with an assurance and
inventiveness that somehow makes it all work.  Cusack brings a manic
energy to his role that seems to propel the film along nicely.  Jonze
has cleverly cast his actors against type, thus subverting audience's
expectations for much of the film.  There are also brief cameos from
the likes of Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and others, that add a certain stamp
of authenticity to the bizarre chain of events.
Being John Malkovich is a surprisingly inventive film that
stuffs in more original ideas than most other films this year.  It is
certainly one of 1999's most unusual and challenging, yet surprisingly
enjoyable films.

_Being_John_Malkovich_ (R) **** (out of ****)
There has never been anything quite like _Being_John_Malkovich_, and
there likely never will be again.  No imitator--a number of which the
film is sure to inspire--could ever capture the clever, surreal dementia
of this "comic fantasia" written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by music
video wunderkind Spike Jonze.  It begins on a somewhat offbeat but
deceptively normal-seeming note: unemployed New York puppeteer Craig
Schwartz (John Cusack) takes a job with a filing company and becomes
infatuated with Maxine (Catherine Keener), who works at a neighboring
company on the 7 1/2 floor (don't ask) even though he is married to dowdy
pet store worker Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  Then comes the absurd wrinkle to
the tale: one day at work Craig stumbles onto a secret tunnel that
leads... into the mind of actor John Malkovich (who plays himself).
Rarely does one ever get to see with one original twist, let alone the
wild and completely unpredictable entirety of _Being_John_Malkovich_; the
portal conceit is merely the jumping-off point for an exploration of
celebrity, identity, sexuality, and other issues that is never less than
imaginative--not to mention insanely funny and consistently surprising. 
Kaufman's giddily complex script and Jonze's adept direction never hits a
false note; even the most outrageous hairpin twist feels like a logical
development. Deftly handling the demanding material and giving it a
certain something more is the amazing cast; Cusack, Diaz, and Keener are
not only funny, but they lend a real pathos to their characters that
lends some genuine emotional involvement to the story.  Best of all,
though, is Malkovich, absolutely hilarious and the epitome of a good
sport as the bewildered man whose head becomes a metaphysical amusement
park for others.  A work of stunning originality, _Being_John_Malkovich_
is an amusement park thrill ride in itself, constantly twisting and
turning its audience in new and unforeseen directions--but unlike the
case with most roller coasters, this film's passengers will walk away
completely satisfied.

 Being John Malkovich (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Starring John Cusack,
Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman. Directed by Spike Jonze
 If you want a different type of movie experience, than "Being John
Malkovich" is it.
 A true original, "Being John Malkovich" is a surreal journey. If you wish
the vicarious adventure of knowing what it's like to walk in another
person's shoes, than this is your ticket.
 What makes "Being John Malkovich" so appealing is its primal familiarity.
It taps into a universal fantasy: How would it be to live the life of a
celebrity for day? An hour? Or even 15 minutes?
 It's a dream we all share. And Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) surely
qualifies as a dreamer.
 Craig is a puppeteer who creates elaborate, cerebral shows using his
puppets who - coincidentally look like him and his wife, Lotte (an almost
unrecognizable Cameron Diaz).
 Lotte, who works at a pet store and tends injured and sick animals in her
and Craig's basement apartment, convinces Craig to look for a job since he
is not earning much of a living as a puppeteer.
 Because he has fast hands, Craig gets a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp,
located on 7 1/2th floor of Manhattan's Mertin-Flemmer office building.
 It also is where he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a free-spirited young
woman who becomes Craig's obsession. However, he's just another loser to
her.
 One day, trying to retrieve a file that falls behind a cabinet, Craig
uncovers a small passageway. He climbs in and gets sucked through a tunnel.
Next thing he knows he is seeing through the eyes of John Malkovich.
 To tell any more would ruin the absolute surprise and wonder of this most
unusual, bizarre and unique feature.
 Suffice it to say that Craig and Maxine join forces and charge a $200 fee
for allowing people to traverse the portal and enter the mind of Malkovich.
The trip is fleeting, lasting only 15 minutes before the traveler is dumped
along the New Jersey Turnpike. I told you this is a weird movie.
 Yet :Being John Malkovich" is so disarming, so much fun that you sit in
the dark and wish you were the one on screen taking the plunge.
 The script for "Being John Malkovich" was written by Charlie Kaufman. It
is his debut feature, and a more auspicious beginning I cannot imagine.
Kaufman's name will be among those listed for original screenplay come
Oscar roll call, and I wouldn't be surprised if he walks away with the
statue.
 Cusack, as usual, gives a brilliant performance as a man who likes the
pull the strings - literally. With his discovery, he becomes the ultimate
puppet master, using Malkovich to serve his own selfish ends.
 Diaz is at first a bit drap and unkempt as Lotte, but as her fascination
with Malkovich builds, her looks and demeanor seem to improve. It's a nice
comic turn.
 Keener nearly steals the film as the amoral Maxine who - at first - only
sees profit in the Malkovich venture. She deserves a supporting actress
Academy Award nomination.
 And then there is John Malkovich. What a sport. What a performance. To
allow himself to be used - and abused - as he does shows not only what a
trouper he is, but what a selfless and generous talent he possesses.
Clearly, Malkovich knows who he is and is comfortable in his own skin. He
must also own one hell of a sense of humor.
 Kaufman and director Spike Jonze (Mark Wahlberg's ill-fated GI comrade in
"Three Kings"), making his feature film debut, have created some very
surreal moments, especially one in which Malkovich enters the portal to get
inside his own head. It is hilarious, wild and a bit scary - almost
something out of a Luis Bunuel movie. The film, despite its comic emphasis,
has a tragic undertone that helps keep everything grounded in a straunge
kind of reality.
 "Being John Malkovich" is that rarity, a movie that stands apart. Nothing
like it has been seen before, and I doubt they'll be many filmmakers trying
to copy it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime, "Alice in Wonderland"-like look
at obsession, self-discovery and love. Don't miss it.

Husband and wife, Craig and Lotte Schwartz, have something in common --
they both love Maxine, played with cocky sexual tension by indie star
Catherine Keener (YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS).  This would-be ménage ŕ
trois is complicated in that Maxine shares Lotte's passion but not
Craig's.  Furthermore, only when Lotte is firmed ensconced in the mind
of John Malkovich, played by the one and only, does Maxine reciprocate
Lotte's love.  Whew.  Is this one wacky setup or what?
John Cusack, a comedic master of both action and reaction shots (most
actors excel at only one), plays Craig.  His wife, Lotte, is played with
offbeat panache by a glamorous actress successfully made to look plain
and completely different.  Since I didn't recognize her, I'm not naming
her here in hopes that you will be just as surprised as I was.
The absolutely hilarious and completely off-the-wall movie, BEING JOHN
MALKOVICH by director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman, takes one
surprising step after another.  With its Escher print of a story, the
energetic movie winds and twists with great glee.
As the story starts, Craig, a puppeteer, is having trouble making a
living.  Answering a want ad, he decides to put his nimble fingers to
work as a fast filer in an office.
The "Alice in Wonderland" type office is located on the 7 1/2th floor of
a skyscraper.  To get there, as any of the building's occupants can show
you, all you need do is punch the emergency button on the elevator just
after the seventh floor.  The crowbar, conveniently located for your
opening pleasure in the corner of the elevator, is used to pry open the
elevator doors.
Once on the infamous, half-sized floor, Craig finds everyone stooping
over as they walk.  Sitting, however, poses no difficulties since the
furniture is all of normal size.  Passing the hiring test by telling the
difference between a Dr. Seuss letter and a real one, Craig starts
working at the world's oddest office.  Maxine is one of his coworkers,
and one of the floor's saner inhabitants.
Maxine, who really doesn't think much of Craig no matter how much he
hits on her, does agree to go out with him for a drink.  "So what do you
do?" she asks as a way to make some small talk and in hopes that he'll
prove to have a more promising future that he would appear to have.
"I'm a puppeteer," he tells her.  "Check!" she barks out.  The next day
she walks away from him complaining that "you play with dolls."
Their relationship changes when he finds a hidden hole behind a filing
cabinet.  It turns out to be a portal into John Malkovich's mind.  Craig
makes the first visit, which turns out to last a standard 15 minutes.
When he tells Maxine about his discovery, she turns it into a business
opportunity that would rival an Internet IPO.  She has people lining up
to be the famous actor.  (A running joke is that most people have no
idea who he is, nor what any of his movies are.  The most common
misconception is that he played "that jewel thief.")
Malkovich is great, finding one way after another to poke fun at
himself.  Looking beefy and bald, even Craig in Malkovich's body
complains, "why couldn't I have found the portal to a younger body."
And if you think the great actor's time is all spent in intellectual
pursuits, you'll be surprised to see him discussing bath towel colors
with a catalogue sales rep on the phone, as he looks with displeasure at
the leftover Chinese food in his fridge.
There are several good cameos.  Charlie Sheen, playing a parody of
himself, serves as Malkovich's friend and advisor.  He offers such
thoughts as, "truth is for suckers, Johnny-boy."  The more Malkovich
denigrates Maxine, the more Sheen wants to have sex with her.  Sheen's
hair toward the end is embarrassingly and hilariously awful.  Brad Pitt
stops by for a one-second, open-mouthed gawk.
You might ask yourself the question of "what happens when a man goes
through his own portal?"  Malkovich does.  I'm not about to reveal the
answer but be prepared to laugh and laugh hard.
So where do you land when your 15 minutes on the Malkovich-mind roller
coaster is up?  Like a new born colt falling to the ground, you are
promptly deposited alongside the New Jersey Turnpike, right by some
classically ugly oil refineries.  Don't ask; I don't know.  The picture
never explains why it works this way, but it's funny, no matter how
often they show it.  Just go with the flow.  Don't question; just laugh
and enjoy it.  Still, I would have liked a small mention in the credits
that somewhere in their subconscious the film must have been inspired by
Lewis Carroll.
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH runs 1:52.  It is rated R for sex and language and
would be fine for teenagers.

Ever feel like being someone else? Elvis, maybe? How about Madonna? Choice
is not an option here. Would you pay 200 bucks to crawl into a small hole in
the wall of a half size office building just to be in John Malkovich's head
for 10 minutes? Huh? Would ya punk? That's the "mind-blowing" ride this
picture offers ... well, not to you, but to other people in the film.
John Cusack is solid as the hippie radical puppeteer whose artistic talents
with wooden dolls are as extreme as his psychotic behavior. The puppets, by
the way, are fantastic. Their chop block shapes move with such grace and
human-realism. Their faces eerily carved into the likeness of Cusack and
Diaz. Diaz (Cusack's wife) and especially Keener (the bold, sexy
distraction) deliver strong performances as well.
Malkovich must have had a blast doing this movie ... pretending to be
Cusack, pretending to be himself. He's captivating as always. With more than
a squirt of lime-twist humor, it's a tightly written adventure fantasy for
the brave of open-mind.
"It's good in here Craig, better than in your wildest dreams." My
complements to the writer and director. The exaggerated audio really helps
to put you inside Malkovich's head. The ending credits also continue the
luring surrealistic feel in visuals and music.
The title isn't just some alternative rock band sounding chime -- it's
exactly what the film is about.

BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (director: Spike Jonze; screenwriter: Charlie
Kaufman; cinematographer: Lance Acord; cast: John Cusack (Craig
Schwartz), Cameron Diaz (Lotte), Catherine Keener (Maxine), John
Malkovich (Himself), Orson Bean (Dr. Lester), Mary Kay Place (Floris),
1999)
First-time film director and former music video director Spike Jonze has
come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on, cooked by
Charles Kaufman's original screenplay, that offers up some very
intangible delicacies on its plate, such as a psychological, personal
and sexual identity study, allowing the eater to suspend belief about
what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind
of another being. It is a playful and provocative look at determining
one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within, featuring an
actual celebrity, the performer, John Malkovich, who is playing himself,
as the mind who is being entered. If someone could market via virtual
reality how to actually do that, it might cost as much as $200 for a 15
minute sightseeing trip down that path, the charge established in the
film for such a trip, while for the movie viewer it is only for the
nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique
experience.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), the film's wormy, unemployed New York
puppeteer and unlikely protagonist, appearing scraggy looking and acting
despondent and unhappy with his lot in life, as someone who knows his
craft but is not appreciated by the public he wishes to conquer and
therefore can't do the work he believes he was put on earth to do. The
last straw for Craig, is seeing his successful competitor put up a
gimmicky display overhanging a highway in Weschester County, of a
gigantic 60-foot Emily Dickinson, entitled "The Belle of Amherst." He
rationalizes his failure to get noticed by stating, "Nobody's looking
for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate."
At home, he is lost in his own problems, with his schlump-like pet store
employed wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is a pet enthusiast, having an
assortment of pets in the house, including a chimpanzee whom she loves
more than her husband. The husband is the one who cheerfully is being
nagged by her to get a job until something materializes for him as a
puppeteer. So he scans the newspapers, and our hero seeks out a job as a
filing clerk for the Lester Corporation, absurdly located on the 71/2th
floor in a Manhattan skyscraper, that has low ceilings forcing everyone
to stoop when walking. The running gag being, that the overhead and the
rent are also low here.
Employed on the same floor as our hero, is an attractive, fast-talking,
sarcastic bundle of promising sex, Maxine Lund (Keeler), who has our
hero tongue-tied and in a flirtatious mood, who is not rebuffed by her
dislike of his physical appearance. She is perfect for the part of the
film's bitch.
What also excites him about his new job, is that he discovers a portal
behind his filing cabinet that goes tunnel-like down into the mind of
John Malkovich and after 15 minutes throws him out on the grassy side of
the New Jersey Turnpike. Since the glimpse into Malkovich's head is more
or less fictional, it's delightfully funny to find Craig turning up
inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading The
Wall Street Journal in his Park Avenue apartment.
A business partnership between the scheming Maxine and Craig is
consumated, as the two decide to advertise in the newspaper and take
celebrity seeking visitors into the secret portal all-through the night.
When Lotte finds out about the portal, she is exhilarated by the
experience of being inside the actor's head and watching him on a date
with Maxine. Lotte becomes the second member of the Schwartz family to
fall head-over-heels for the irresistible Maxine. It seems when inside
the head of the actor, the Schwartz's are able to attract the elusive
Maxine, but when left to their own identities, she treats them as
nobodies.
Having their fun with this nutty script is Orson Bean, as the
105-year-old entrepreneur, Dr. Lester, who is the head of the Lester
Corporation, and is devilishly amusing as the lecherous businessman and
the man who knows more about the portal than it appears he does, as he
uses it as a way of living forever by changing identities. Also seen at
work is Floris (Mary Kay Place), as a confused secretary who is an
expert on speech impediments but who doesn't realize she suffers from
one herself, and gives an outstanding supporting performance, adding
more punch to an already zany story.
The film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough
nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy. But even
as it was petering out, it still managed to have enough brilliant
glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity, to make
it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing, and leave off
with an ending that is unnerving. What makes this insane premise work
out so surprisingly well, is that the actors get the joke and run with
it, even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner
being along the way that are fun to scrutinize. And if anything more can
be said about John Malkovich than that he is a grand actor, it is that
he comes across as a good person, someone with a good sense of humor and
someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is
supposedly at his own expense. This is the kind of strange film that one
would expect to be released as an art-house indie, yet here it is
playing as a mainstream big production.

The art of puppetry is commonly associated with children's
entertainment. However, when taken to its heights, it is sublime and
abstract, requiring the puppeteer to be both a dextrous manipulator
and an expressive performer. While acting requires the actor to
communicate mood and emotion through kinesthetic expression, puppetry
demands the same expressiveness while adding the extra dimension of a
separate body, one which is more difficult to control.
This curious film begins with Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), an out of
work puppeteer, looking for gainful employment. He is a master of his
art, but because he is unwilling to debase his talent for commercial
success, he must find some type of menial work to help support himself
and his pet-addicted wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Craig happens to find
a position where some of his talents give him an advantage. His
dextrous fingers make him a superior file clerk, and he gets a job
with a mysterious filing company.
>From its outset, it is clear that the film will be unusual and
interesting. The opening scene of real puppetry is haunting and
mesmerizing. Lotte's eclectic menagerie of exotic animals portends an
odd, expressive story. It is not surprising that the director of this
film, which has a strong foundation in vivid imagery, comes from a
background of directing music videos. Although that medium is usually
characterized by insipid depictions of musicians and singers
unconvincingly pretending to be actually performing, a handful of
directors are able to inject real creativity into their craft, and
Spike Jonez is widely recognized as one of them. Among his works are
the Beastie Boys' Paranoid and Weezer's Buddy Holly. Jonez capably
translates his talents to the big screen with this film and produces a
work of stunning originality.
The emergence of more narrative developments fully launch the film to
its "cruising altitude". First, Craig becomes smitten with a sexy,
sassy coworker, Maxine (Catherine Keener), who is a stark contrast to
the dowdy Lotte, and proceeds to pursue her. The second, and more
momentous, development is that Craig accidentally discovers a tunnel
in his office that leads to an alternate reality. It seems that
whoever enters the tunnel becomes temporarily transported within the
mind of contemporary actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). The
participant experiences all of Malkovich's sensations for a short time
before being abruptly dumped beside a New Jersey highway.
The most interesting aspect of the story is that the audience shares
in the experience of "being John Malkovich". That is, the role played
by the actor is that of the actor himself, therefore instead of seeing
the character on screen as a fictitious person (which he surely is),
the impression created is that the John Malkovich of the film is the
real John Malkovich, thus the viewers have the feeling that they are
peering into the everyday existence of the actor, John Malkovich.
The film is not flawless, as some inconsistencies are conveniently
ignored. However, this is dwarfed by all the other rewarding aspects
of the film. The film aspires to tell a story that is many dimensions
deeper than a typical movie, and it is highly effective in doing so.
Highly recommended. This is a film of exceptional imagination and
quirky curiosity. The surreal story is engagingly developed and its
many complexities are interwoven with deft craftsmanship. Director
Spike Jonez scores a breakthrough in his first feature film by
composing a clear vision for this complex and highly entertaining
effort. Viewers who desire a familiar, formulaic effort may find the
film difficult to digest, but anyone who appreciates originality and
creativity will enjoy this film.

How's this for a wild ride?  Shoot down a darkened
tunnel at an amazingly high speed.  Experience a
cathartic transformation as you take on the life of
someone else for 15 awe-inspiring minutes.  Finally,
drop into a ditch by the side of the New Jersey
Turnpike.  No, it's not the newest ride at your nearby
amusement park.  Rather, it's a unique life-affirming
journey that one can take by entering a strange
portal.  If you've ever wanted to get inside someone's
head, particularly John Malkovich's, then this is the
way to do it.
`Being John Malkovich' is a satisfyingly and sublimely
rich film about the people we are and the people that
we want to be.  Who we are can be a gut-wrenching
nightmare.  For those like Craig (John Cusack), it's a
self-affirmation of failure and a perpetual state of
hopelessness.  Slovenly dressed, lacking in charisma,
and hoping to make it as a professional puppeteer, his
life is one big dead end.  `There's no need for a
puppeteer in today's world,' he states.  It doesn't
matter that he's an excellent puppeteer (the sequences
featuring puppets are astounding); he's a man who only
wishes to escape from the confines of his dreary life.
 Equally dreary is his loveless marriage to wife Lotte
(an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz).  Whatever magic they
once had has faded.  Looking like inebriated victims
that never left the 1960s, they emptily talk about
having children while forcing themselves to seem
interested in each other's events of the day.  Lotte
seems more interested in her pets, which include a
loquacious parrot and a chimp that can untie knots. 
Meanwhile, it's time for Craig to get a job because
his life as a street performer brings him more black
eyes than quarters (the scene that makes this evident,
featuring a nun and monk puppet is hilarious).
The ad that Craig answers brings him to LesterCorp,
situated on the 7˝ floor of a building where access
requires you to press the elevator's emergency stop
button at just the right moment.  Then, you need to
take the crowbar to force the doors open while the
alarm rings loudly in the background.  On this floor,
the ceiling is only 5 feet high to keep overhead
low,' quips the company's President (Orson Bean). 
This work environment confines him even more, and it's
no help that he's falling head over heels for Maxine
(Catherine Keener), a strong-willed co-worker that
flaunts her sexuality with as much chutzpah as her
merciless belittlement of him.  By this point, I think
that I'd want to be anybody but him too.
However, he soon makes a tremendous discovery that not
only may be the answer to his prayers, but also sets
the film's enjoyably surreal tone.  Craig discovers a
portal that actually allows him to enter the mind of
John Malkovich (Malkovich plays himself).  By assuming
this new body, all fears and disappointments are left
behind.  For him, this is the ultimate experience as
both a puppeteer and as a man who desperately wants to
leave his dismal life behind.  But it also holds some
interesting opportunities for Maxine, who wants to
exploit it as a business, and Lotte, who finds it
weirdly, sexually stimulating.  
BJM is endlessly inventive and continues to surprise
throughout while glazing the film with fresh ideas and
sharp dialogue.  I was especially impressed with a
sequence where Malkovich enters his own brain to find
out what he himself is really like.  Director Spike
Jonze deftly handles a complexly woven tapestry of
ideas and manages to find a satisfying resolution to
each.  And I suspect that you'll be revisiting many of
the ideas once you've left the theatre.  Expect an
Oscar nod for Best Film.  Thank goodness this film
wasn't called `Being Al Gore.'

Being John Malkovich is an original film of genius. Many may have 
problems comprehending the movie's complex, multi-layered plot and its 
box office will consequently look to be no better than mid-range. 
However, a video shelf life prolonged by second viewings should make 
this film a cult- if not a mainstream- classic.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a 30-something year old puppeteer who 
seems to be wasting his life away, waiting to someday find a job in the 
marionette business. Craig's wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), is a 
pet-freak who goes so far as to take her chimpanzee to a psychiatrist. 
They live in an apartment in the only city that could possible tolerate, 
not to mention accept, them: The Big Apple.
Craig finally comes across a job where he can use his hands and fingers, 
a filing assistant, and is quickly hired. His office space may be the 
only thing more bazaar than his animal-infested apartment; it is on the 
7 BD floor (which requires a crow bar and the emergency alarm on an =
elevator to access and has ceilings that appear to be about four feet 
high), the secretary has a hearing impediment similar to one of Gilda 
Radner's old Saturday Night Live characters and his boss is a 
105-year-old man who openly shares of his necessity to urinate in a 
sitting position and desires to have sex with the aforementioned 
secretary. Yet the oddest feature of his new office is a tiny door 
behind a filling cabinet. The door is a portal into John Malkovich's 
head. When you enter this portal you are sucked into Malkovich, seeing 
through his eyes and partially controlling him. Then, after 15 minutes, 
you are spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Once Craig discovers this 
hidden door, the possibilities become infinite.
Andy Warhol once suggested that everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. 
In this movie, everyone has at least 15 minutes of Malkovich. This seems 
to hit on one of society's more voyeuristic obsessions: knowing 
others' every movie. For Craig being Malkovich is an opportunity to be 
a sexually attractive man with name recognition. For Lotte it is an 
opportunity to have sex with other women. (She is so inspired the she 
even decides at one point to "85talk to Dr. Feldman about sexual =
re-assignment surgery.") But when Malkovich gets inside of Malkovich it 
is a horrifying experience that is hilarious to watch. (It would be 
ruining one of the film's great moments to say any more.)
John Malkovich is, obviously, key to this film. He deserves credit for 
taking the role as himself despite the film's critical plot device of 
him having name recognition but relatively little role recognition. 
Should this production become the cult classic that it likely will, 
Malkovich may discover that he has accidentally gone from one extreme to 
another. He portrays a dramatic character in his next film, The 
Messenger, and may find that people have difficulty taking him seriously 
since he spoofs himself in this movie. (Well timed Halloween masks of 
his face were included in the press kits, a fine example of the level of 
lampooning in this film.)
Rod Sterling became so well respected because he fully explored the 
Twilight Zone, an interesting place that could have been left only half 
covered. Unfortunately, this movie falls short of doing that. At the 
beginning, after Craig has discovered the portal and used it for the 
first time, he contemplates the great philosophical questions that 
arise. For example, he had a piece of wood in his hand when he entered 
Malkovich. When Craig fell on the New Jersey Turnpike, it was gone. So, 
what happened to the wood? The movie could have been even more engaging 
had it explored these options but the film dodged them altogether, thus 
falling short of its potential. Although this is a real pity, you must 
remember that this flaw only exists because great films like this are 
held to a higher standard.

In 1992, actor John Malkovich appeared as a clown in a Woody Allen movie
called Shadows and Fog.  Veteran British actor Donald Pleasence, best
known for his role in The Great Escape, played a doctor in that movie.
Pleasence played a preacher in a 1968 movie called Will Penny, with
Charlton Heston in the title role.  (With me so far?)  In 1995, your
humble reviewer met Charlton Heston at a Republican fundraiser in
Dallas.  This, therefore, gives me three degrees of separation from John
Malkovich.  (Your mileage may vary.)
The conceit of Being John Malkovich is that you can reduce that "Six
Degrees of Separation" we're all supposed to have down to one.  For two
hundred dollars, we're told, you can enter a portal leading into the
brain (consciousness?) (soul?) of John Malkovich for fifteen minutes.
You are with him as he eats breakfast, or rehearses a play, or catches a
cab.  After your time is up, you fall into a drainage ditch on the New
Jersey Turnpike and have to hitchhike back to New York.
Now this... this is a brilliant idea, no mistake.  In our fantasies
about writing the Great American Screenplay, this is the kind of idea we
wish we all had.  It's an idea that's just beyond the cutting edge of
reality while still being instantly comprehensible to everyone.  It
gives you a lead character that everyone knows and recognizes.  And its
one sentence summary -- evoked by John Cusack as "You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes, then after about 15 minutes, you're spit
out into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike!" -- may be the
best pitch since "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are twins."
And, of course, with this wonderful, creative idea as the backbone, you
can do pretty much whatever you want.  You can assemble all sorts of
characters, put them in almost any setting you want, slide them through
the portal, and see what they're like on the other side. You can,
literally, do anything with this idea.
This is the promise of Being John Malkovich, but it is also the danger.
C.S. Lewis noted that the problem with great ideas like this is that
they exploit themselves spontaneously.  Lewis, talking about his big
idea in The Screwtape Letters, said that his demonic correspondence,
like a runaway horse, "would run away with you for a thousand pages if
you gave it its head."
What happens to Being John Malkovich is that writer Charlie Kaufman and
director Spike Jonze give their imaginations free rein, and the movie
runs away on them.  Being John Malkovich is less like a runaway horse
than it is like a runaway carousel, with horses and bodies flying around
at top speed in dizzying arcs.  But there's no centripetal force to keep
the movie from spinning wildly out of control.  Being John Malkovich
spits out eccentric, inventive ideas at a mile a minute.  Each of the
ideas isn't really bad, in and of itself, but there are so many of them,
piled one on top of the other, that the whole movie is a walk through
Bizarro World.
Take the characters, for instance.  John Cusack is a quirky puppeteer
whose idea of puppet shows is Heloise and Abelard instead of Punch and
Judy.  Early on, he gets beat up by a critic, which apparently happens
often.  Cameron Diaz plays his wife, who's sort of a cross between a
young Geena Davis and Dr. Doolittle.  (She's got the funniest line in
the movie, which I won't share with you, as it changes the course of the
movie.)  Catherine Keener plays his co-worker and partner in the
burgeoning business of sharing slices of Malkovich's life.  She seems
perfectly normal for a while until she becomes a walking icon of lust.
(Really.)  It says something about Being John Malkovich that the only
character who looks and acts normal the whole way through is Charlie
Sheen.
But despite all of the layers of self indulgent weirdness, Being John
Malkovich has three fantastic, wonderful elements that make it a must
see.  The first, and most obvious, is the performance of Malkovich
himself.  Malkovich may not win Best Actor, but he's the Best Sport of
the year for even agreeing to participate in this project.  It's easy to
imagine what would have happened had he said no -- we might have gotten
something skin-crawlingly godawful like "Being Fran Drescher" -- but
Malkovich shows us all why this movie is only possible with an
undeniably great actor in the title role.  Part of the role is an
inspired self-parody, part of the role shows off the best possession
scenes since Steve Martin in All of Me, and part of the role is his
participation in two of the weirdest sequences ever shot on film.
These are the other two reasons to see the movie.  Twice, we're
transported into John Malkovich's subconscious, and these two scenes
completely redeem the movie.  All of the bizarre and odd things that
infest the movie come together in two thrilling, jaw dropping moments
that are completely original while being completely unlike each other.
The key thing to remember about Being John Malkovich is that the whole
concept of the portal is a misdirection.  The audience isn't really
being sucked into Malkovich's brain, it's being sucked into the
imagination of Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze.  This is not a
comfortable place for everyone, and when you get dumped out of the
theater, you may feel disoriented and dizzy.  But the high points of
this thrill ride are well worth the price of admission.

"So how does a conservative movie reviewer, who doesn't want to spoil
the movie, write a review? The same way he takes the lamb chop from
rottweiller -- carefully. Another way is to fill two-thirds of the
column with irrelevant woolgathering about other topics so that you
only have room for a paragraph for the real review."  -- Jonah Goldberg

Being John Malkovich  Dir: Spike Jonze. Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
The pitch: A puppeteer reluctantly takes a job with a bizarre company on the
7 Â˝ floor of a NYC office tower, where he discovers a secret door leading
into the mind of actor John Malkovich.
Got that? Hereâs a wildly inventive, completely crazy satire of celebrity
obsession -- spiced with a quest for eternal life, adultery and betrayal,
madness and gender confusion. And, gulp, itâs the funniest movie of the
year.
Being John Malkovich almost defies description. First-time screenwriter
Charlie Kaufmanâs delightfully demented tale unfolds like a hallucination
that could have been penned by Lewis Carroll under heavy medication. We
guarantee the gentle readers of Cinema Uprising have never seen anything
like this. They probably never will again.
Cusack is a sensitive puppeteer whose skills just arenât in high demand,
although he blames his lagging career on âthis wintry job climate.â? His
loopy wife (Diaz), is devoted to a menagerie of house pets - a dog, assorted
cats, a neurotic chimpanzee (the monkeyâs problem stems from a childhood
âincident,â? we are told), an iguana, an aquarium of tropical fish and an
obnoxious cockatoo. The noise in their one-bedroom apartment could push
anyone over the edge.
Diaz tells her brooding husband that he needs to find a real job. Responding
to a cryptic classified ad, he takes the elevator of an office building to
the 7 Â˝ floor - yes, the elevator stops between the 7th and 8th levels.
Scrambling into the hallway, he discovers that the ceilings are only five
feet tall. Everyone walks hunched over, turning their heads sideways to
talk, like Quasimodo in the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The explanation behind
the construction of this floor is just as preposterous and equally funny.
Cusack ambles down the hall, puzzled, looking as though heâs just popped
down a rabbit hole. The receptionist talks in gibberish and confuses his
legitimate questions with sexual harassment. Flummoxed, heâs ushered in to
meet the boss, a mysterious doctor who doesnât explain the companyâs
business, but offers his new employee a position in the filing department.
The jobâs a snore, but Cusack takes an immediate liking to co-worker Maxine
(Keener), a shark in a womanâs business suit. She doesnât think much of the
scruffy puppeteer, but gets the hots for his wife. Diaz is equally smitten
with Maxine.
As if that wasnât enough trouble, Cusack discovers a tiny door behind a
filing cabinet at work. The portal opens to a narrow corridor, dripping with
mud and effluvia. He crawls inside and is propelled, as though riding a
water slide, through some sort of metaphysical corridor that deposits him
into the mind of Oscarď'-nominated actor John Malkovich. Cusack sees the
world through the eyes of Malkovich for precisely 15 minutes before he is
ejected, falling from the sky by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Itâs
an inspired bit of lunacy.
The time limit inside the actorâs mind is no doubt a reference to Andy
Warholâs comment that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.
Exhilarated, Cusack tells Maxine of his trip inside Malkovich. She smells a
business opportunity. Who wouldnât pay to be someone else - anybody else -
for 15 minutes? The fact that itâs a celebrity only sweetens the deal.
Soon customers are queued up along the office hallway, waiting to pay $200
each for a ride inside the famous actor. Cusack persuades his wife to give
it a try. Diaz slips inside the portal, but only after Maxine arranges a
date with Malkovich. That way, while sheâs inside the actorâs mind, Diaz is
able to indulge her fantasies with Maxine. She can be a man seducing a
woman. The new perspective is intoxicating. After Cusack picks her up by the
turnpike, Diaz declares that she either wants a sex-change or to be a
lesbian. Doesnât matter which. Itâs hard to convey the hilarity of this
scene, which is best experienced first-hand, as a small comic miracle that
keeps building as Cusack does a slow burn.
Malkovich is superb playing not so much himself, but perhaps the public
perception of who he is - a quiet man given to contemplation and understated
elegance. The supporting players are likewise marvelous, especially Diaz,
who seems to take delight in hiding her beauty behind a challenging role.
Cusack is always fun to watch, although this may be his best role since
Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). He fully realizes the controlling nature of his
character â` after all, for a guy who loves to pull the strings of
marionettes, what could be more satisfying than crawling inside another
personâs brain and making him do tricks?
First-time feature director Jonze, who is best known for shooting music
videos, has a fractured way of looking at the world. Itâs as though he was
peering at his characters through a prism of broken glass -- the different
facets of their personalities never throw the same reflection twice. Theyâre
unpredictable. As such, we feel off-balance in an amusing way, like
exploring a funhouse with warped mirrors and tilted floors.
Being John Malkovich belongs on any top 10 list for 1999. For all its
lunacy, this unique picture merits serious Academy Award consideration. It
is audacious, anarchic and outrageously funny filmmaking. Catch it quick. We
will not see its kind again.
Rated R for language, sexual situations.

I've always loved director Spike Jonze's original music videos ranging from
the Beastie Boys' "Sabotage" to Bjork's "It's so quiet" to Daft Punk's "Da
Funk", so I was one of the first to applaud his transition to movies with
this, his motion picture directorial debut. With Jonze's obvious penchant
for the creative, I expected nothing less that a film that would be unlike
any other. And boy-oh-boy, did he deliver on that expectation.
PLOT:
An unemployed puppeteer finds himself a temporary "regular job" as a file
clerk in an office on the 71/2th floor of a corporate building. One day, he
discovers a tiny door and a room which apparently leads into the brain of
actor John Malkovich, allowing anyone who enters the portal to automatically
be inside the thespian for about 15 minutes before being spit out and onto
the side of a New Jersey Turnpike. Got that?
CRITIQUE:
This is one messed up movie! Messed up in a good way, of course. This is
probably the most creative film of the year with a script loaded with layers
of surreal cream, a cast playing against type and scoring with solid
performances all around, and an inventive look inside the infamous
Wharhol-annointed "everyone will get their 15-minutes of fame" parable. On
top of all that, this film actually makes sense (for the most part) unlike
many of the other "weird" films which attempt to break the calmness of
Hollywood's arrangement with the mediocre (see BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS) and
is genuinely funny! I could see Dali and Frued sitting around with some
over-salsa'd nachos and having a blast with this movie! Oh, and how I
wouldn't mind being a fly on the wall when they attempted to interpret this
film's many zings and zangs. Fry this egg, why don't you.
What was even cooler about this film was that I never knew what was going to
happen next. In fact, its main plot force of a portal leading inside actor
John Malkovich's head was just the springboard from which an even wilder
ride through one's own conscious and subconscious feelings of identity,
life, love and sexuality took form. Wonderfully written, succinctly directed
by Jonze, who could not have picked a more appropriate script for his own
paranormal sensibilities, and featuring an unrecognizable great performance
by Cameron Diaz, another solid show from Catherine Keener, and Cusack
showing us that he can play more than just a wise-cracking smart-ass. It
also needs to be said that actor John Malkovich, besides being a good sport
about the whole thing, plays himself and all the other characters extremely
well, and does quite the job of convincing everyone that he is himself (?).
Looking back, there were no specific scenes in this film which were
particularly memorable, and the script may have gone a little over-the-top
in certain respects (did they really have to be living with a monkey?), but
one cannot blame the genius when running rampant and dropping a couple of
their eccentricities by the wayside. All in all, an entertaining surreal
ball of confusionary psychological fun for the strange one in all of us.
Also, look for a couple of pretty cool cameos by some of Hollywood's
hipsters. Definitely, NOT for everyone!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Spike Jonze's real name is Adam Spiegel. He was born in St-Louis,
Missouri, and recently married the daughter of legendary director Francis
Ford Coppolla, Sofia. This union would make actor Nicolas Cage his
cousin-in-law. Some of you may remember Spike as an actor in this fall's
critically praised flick, THREE KINGS, in which he played Conrad Vig, Mr.
White Trash himself.
Charlie Kaufman's next screenplay is an offbeat romantic comedy called HUMAN
NATURE and will feature Patricia Arquette as a woman with too much body hair
in love with a man with the world's smallest penis who, in turn, is in love
with a perfect French beauty. When a man, raised as an ape, enters the
picture, it throws things out of balance. Spike Jonze will co-produce.
Catherine Keener is married to fellow actor Dermot Mulroney.
Look closely and you will see actor Gary Sinise sitting behind John
Malkovich in one of the pictures of his upbringing, as he and Sinise
co-founded Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre. Malkovich recently broke up a
street fight in Spain and lives in France with his family.
Cameron Diaz was set to play Sonya Blade in 1995's MORTAL KOMBAT, but broke
her wrist prior to filming and was replaced by actress Bridgette Wilson.
Yes, one of the producers of this film is none other than the lead singer of
the rock band R.E.M., Michael Stipe.
Orson Bean, the man who plays Dr. Lester in this film, was blacklisted by
Hollywood in the 1950s.

For sheer audacity and outrageous invention, you can do no better than the 
truly extraordinary "Being John Malkovich," a bizarre, involving, strangely 
moving film experience. Putting it plainly, it is unlike anything I have ever 
seen before. 
John Cusack stars as a long-haired puppeteer named Craig Schwartz, an 
expressive, magical talent who performs his act on the streets. Most of his 
puppet shows contain sexual connotations, and thus are not always embraced by 
passerby. He lives at home with his animal-loving wife, Lotte (an 
unrecognizable Cameron Diaz), but the marriage is unexciting and their 
conversations do not merit much communication. When Craig is not performing, 
he sleeps most of the day until he gets the energy to look for a job. This 
leads him to an office vicinity located in the 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan 
building (one has to crawl in between floors to get in) where he works as a 
fast file clerk. It is here where he discovers a mysterious portal that leads 
into the mind of John Malkovich! 
The portal changes Craig's life, as well as Lotte's (who forms a sexual 
awakening). Along for the ride is Craig's co-worker. a sexpot vixen 
(cunningly played by Catherine Keener) whom Craig is attracted to. To say 
much more is to ruin the fun of "Being John Malkovich," which takes its 
central idea through all kinds of delirious heights and lengths with one 
inventive twist after another. We are talking sexual connotations galore, 
celebrities, parentage, a one-hundred-year-old office manager, chimps, wooden 
puppets, a bald-headed Charlie Sheen and, of course, John Malkovich. 
Cusack's Craig is the perfect foible for this type of bizarre fantasy - the 
Everyman as the malcontent artist trying to make a name for himself any which 
way he can. We are led every step of the way of his unusual circumstance, and 
slowly the subjective stance of his character shifts to Lotte, back to Cusack 
and Keener, and Malkovich. This leads to an interesting question: whose life 
is it anyway? Anyone can live inside Malkovich's mind briefly before being 
deported hilariously into the New Jersey Turnpike, but when can a mind not be 
your own? Craig uses this portal as a portal into his own alternate 
existence, and the film grows more complex and darkly comic as Craig's 
ambitions grow.
Cameron Diaz is astoundingly good, and proves she is a fine character actress 
- look how well she disappears into the role of the sexually carnivirous 
Lotte. This is clearly her finest work since the comic powerhouse of "There's 
Something About Mary." Catherine Keener gives an acutely observant 
performance - her best scenes are when she tries to woo Malkovich (in and out 
of his brain) or when she seduces Charles and Lotte in their apartment. 
Malkovich is as always Malkovich, an elegantly stylish actor - he seems like 
the right actor for this kind of mind trip, though the running joke in the 
film is that most of the characters can't recall what films he has appeared 
in.
"Being John Malkovich" is directed by music-video director Spike Jonze, who 
often relies a bit too much on hand-held camerawork, but nevertheless has an 
efficient, straightforward style. Writer Charlie Kaufman must have had a 
wonderful time concocting all the different paradoxes and twists with such a 
novel idea - he runs with it and takes it from one extreme to another. It is 
not so much about being someone else as it is about losing your soul in the 
process. This is the first film I would literally call a mind trip of the 
first order.

You know John Malkovich. He's the darkly compelling actor with
awkward features who graced the screen in films such as `Dangerous
Liaisons', `Of Mice And Men' and `In The Line Of Fire'.
Few would deny that he is one of America's most underappreciated
actors, yet even fewer would think him a good subject for a fictional
feature film. However, with the weird and wildly original `Being
John Malkovich', director Spike (`You Mean The Little Cubes You
Put In Hot Water To Make Soup?') Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman
have proven to be part of that minority.
The word quirky doesn't even begin to describe the eccentricity
that is `Being John Malkovich'.  John Cusack plays Craig
Schwartz, an unemployed puppeteer who, after being urged by his homely
wife, Lottie (Cameron Diaz), gets a job as a filing clerk at a company
called LesterCorp.
You see, LesterCorp. is on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building in
New York City, which means that you can't stand up in your office,
and that it takes some precise planning to get there by elevator. On
the 7 1/2 floor, he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a beautiful woman
who isn't interested in him.  On the 7 1/2 floor, he meets Lester
(Orson Bean), his boss who claims to be over 100 years old.  And on
the 7 1/2 floor, he finds a portal that allows you to spend 15 minutes
in John Malkovich's brain before ejecting you into a ditch on the
New Jersey Turnpike. No joke.
`Being John Malkovich' may sound weird so far, but believe me,
things do get weirder. The `love triangle' involving Craig,
Lottie, Maxine and John Malkovich is perhaps the oddest relationship
ever put to film. And yes, Cameron Diaz does get locked up in a cage
with a monkey and scream `you're ruining my actualization as a
man!'
John Malkovich is a wonder. As himself, he gives one of his edgiest
performances to date, and certainly his most accurate. In the film, we
see a self deprecating Malkovich reading the Wall Street Journal,
notifying a cab driver that he never played an art thief, and trying
to seduce an obsessed fan.
Director Spike Jonze, who directed the video for Weezer's `Buddy
Holly' as well as starring in `Three Kings', has come out of
nowhere to help create the year's most original comedy. With a taut
and clever script by Charlie Kaufman, and a uniformly excellent
ensemble cast, `Being John Malkovich' stands out as a distinct
work of modern art.
It's hard to write a coherent review about a film this
dazzling. `Being John Malkovich' is a mind boggling head trip
that proves that independent spirit still exists in the world of
mainstream filmmaking. Without giving away anything more about it, let
me say that this film is truly one to seek out. A dark comedy classic.

 "Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man."
Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, Orson Bean, John
Malkovich Rated R.
As many of us have long suspected, and as Being John Malkovich proves,
the people behind the enigma we know as Hollywood really should be
institutionalized. I don't know what idiot had the bright idea to
finance this insane movie, but whoever it was should get an honorary
Oscar. The result is an exercise in bona fide originality, a wacky,
weird film that is surreal and straight-forward at the same
time. "Offbeat" doesn't even begin to describe it.
An abstract of the plot will give some of you the temptation to dive
for your browser's "Back" button, but stay with me. The film stars John
Cusack as Craig Schwartz, an unhappily married (to Cameron Diaz, whom I
didn't even recognize until a third of the way into the movie)
puppeteer who is forced to get a day job at Lester Corp., a filing
business on the 7 1/2th floor of a skyscraper where the ceilings are so
low, the employees have to stoop the whole time. The company is headed
by 105 year-old Dr. Lester, whose odd secretary has convinced him that
he is suffering from a speech impediment even though he speaks clearly.
So one sunny afternoon, as Craig is merrily filing away, a stack of
papers falls behind a cabinet. Craig moves the cabinet away from the
wall and is shocked to discover a little door, which opens to a
passageway just big enough for him to crawl through. Curious, he goes
in. After a few feet, the door is shut and he is sucked deeper into the
hole until he reaches John Malkovich. Let me clarify. This rabbit hole
that Craig finds is -- yes -- a portal into the head of John Malkovich,
the actor. For 15 minutes, you get to experience the world through John
Malkovich's eyes, until you are thrown in a ditch by the New Jersey
Turnpike.
It gets weirder yet. You see, Craig falls for his sexy co-worker Maxine
(Catherine Keener)... and so does his wife, who all of a sudden
realizes that she wants to be a man. When Maxine starts actually dating
Malkovich, both Craig and his wife use the portal to have sex with
Maxine via Malkovich. Meanwhile, Craig and Maxine start a service: for
some $200 a pop, you can be John Malkovich for 15 minutes.
Alright, you can catch your breath. I can wait.
All done? Good. My first order of business, then, is to inform you that
even though you may have been positively repulsed by my plot synopsis,
Being John Malkovich is a masterpiece of lunacy. Love it or hate it,
it's the most inventive thing to come about since The Truman Show. The
idea itself seems inconceivable. I'm not sure who thought of it, but
whoever did has a great future in Hollywood. Even more importantly,
Hollywood needs him.
The brilliance of Being John Malkovich is in the execution as well as
the concept. First time director Spike Jonze made one genius move: his
movie never admits just how weird it is. The script is way out there,
but everything is laid out in a matter-of-fact style. In effect, the
film is the epitome of deadpanning, which is exactly what makes it so
effective. There is a point in the middle of the film where Cameron
Diaz tells John Cusack not to "stand in the way of her actualization as
a man." The line is hilarious, the funniest thing I've heard all year.
And yet unlike any gag the Austin Powers sequel, for instance, it
doesn't feel like it was intended to elicit gales of laughter. So we
laugh in retrospect rather than right then and there. And ya know what?
It's been a week and the joke only gets funnier.
Kudos to the real two-time Oscar nominee John Malkovich for agreeing to
play this slightly exaggerated version of himself. The role stops just
short of self-parody; the actor is never jeered or mocked. Indeed, this
is probably Malkovich's best role and best performance to date. I
strongly believe that the hardest role to play is yourself. John
Malkovich's work here should not be ignored come award time.
I saw Being John Malkovich immediately after Mansfield Park, which was
unoriginal and mostly uninteresting. I appreciated Malkovich that much
more. It's a film to treasure.

        When a mud-caked woman (Catherine Keener) in a ditch alongside the
New Jersey turnpike screams to another (Cameron Diaz) that she's carrying
*her* child, you snicker nervously, not just because of the absurdity of
the situation but because, in the scheme of things, you believe it.
        That's the strength of Charlie Kaufman's brutally original
screenplay for "Being John Malkovich," a film that's... well, just out
there.
        "Being John Malkovich" is the kind of film you might want to see
several times to appreciate fully: every characterization, every line of
dialogue, every frame of film stock has something unique to offer.  Even a
twenty-word synopsis of the plot screams originality in such bold
brushstrokes that you wonder how this picture even got made: "An unemployed
puppeteer takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal into the head
of John Malkovich."  That's "John Malkovich, The Actor" by the way.
        This portal only allows access to every living, breathing Malkovich
moment for fifteen minutes at a time though.  Then you're spat out into
that ditch alongside the NJTP.
        Channeling Kaufman's outrageously surreal imagination is first-time
feature director Spike Jonze (he was the fourth GI in "Three Kings").  A
former director of Beastie Boys rock videos, Jonze deserves enormous credit
here.  He doesn't get carried away with the strangeness of it all, and
keeps his editor under tight control.
        "Being John Malkovich" features a wonderful, largely unrecognizable
cast including John Cusack as the down-on-his-luck puppeteer (great puppets
by the way), Diaz as his pet shop owner wife who brings her work home with
her (did I mishear her or did she actually ask her *monkey* to help with
the dishes?), and Keener as the ice-cold office fatale who knows an
entrepreneurial opportunity when she sees one.  All three are excellent
(Keener excellent?  I did say she was unrecognizable).
        Most actors would kill to get their name above a film's title, but
Malkovich does the impossible: he gets his name *in* it.  And he deserves
it too.  Not only is he a terrific sport throughout, but he plays himself
brilliantly (which is harder than it sounds) and then adds to the fun by
playing himself possessed by John Cusack.  It doesn't end, or even begin
there--just wait until Malkovich enters his own portal!  It's wacky,
cerebral entertainment that knows no boundaries.

Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich (Who
Else?), Orsen Bean, and a slew of star cameos.
WOW! What a movie. It's everything a movie can be: funny, dramatic,
interesting, weird, funny, weird and strikingly original. Yep that pretty much
describes this movie. It starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one
of the weirdest, funniest most original movies I have ever seen. It boggles the
mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often.
Besides being one of the best films of the year, Being John Malkovich may as
well be one of the best movies ever. Period. Then again there are so many good
movies, that one cannot pick an all time favorite.
John Cusack plays a puppeteer Craig Schwartz a man out of a job, in search of a
job. His wife Lotte Schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable
Cameron Diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and
has about every kind of animal you could think of. Craig finds a job as a file
at the 7˝ floor of a business building...you have to pry open the elevator
doors open before it reaches floor eight, the 7˝ floor is just a floor between
7 and 8. He is hired by his 105 year old boss (Orsen Bean) to be a filer. In
his office, he discovers a little door, to which was boarded up and hidden.
To his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it, he then gets sucked
to the end and ends up in John Malkovich's mind. Fifteen minutes later he is
shot out onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He returns to tell his
co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) that he has found a portal that will lead
him into John Malkovich's mind, she doesn't believe him but after she sees it
it changes her mind. Lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that
being someone else is good after all. John Malkovich of course has no idea what
is going on, and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and
turns, that we don't know what really happened.
John Cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself
could play. He fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast. Cameron
Diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women, is
made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive. She however gives a very comic
performance and this could easily be her best role to date. Catherine Keener is
very funny and sexy as Maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the
magic himself John Malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big
time homage to the master himself. The whole group combined gives us a
wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever.
Spike Jonze (Three Kings) makes his fabulous directing debut, and did a
fantastic job of directing this new classic film. He lets the viewer go on the
trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie. By the time the
ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film
was. The screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman was hilarious and often
thought-provoking. The film also had a soft side to it and even though the
ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming.
The whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles. From Cameron
Diaz's appearence to John Malkovich's explorations I laughed very hard, and it
may as well be as funny as As Good As It Gets (The FUNNIEST!). There isn't a
slow point in the movie, or an overused idea. There are no cliches except for
the fact that this is the most original, inventie, witty, and smart movie I've
seen in a long time. I found myself amazed by everything: The direction,
acting, writing and the whole idea of the movie.
By the end I had to wonder why Hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this
anymore. Or why they don't. All filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas
of movies to come out. This was a surprise hit as was American Beauty. 'Being
John Malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year, and in the top 10 best
films ever made. It has something that no other movies playing now has. In fact
it may as well be the best movie out right now. I highly recommend 'Being John
Malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed.

Being John Malkovich: alice in hollywood
The test of a fantastic story is whether or not you can interpret it in such
a way that all the 'fantastic' stuff comes out as projected material--some
character's internal world being presented as external. Think Fisher King.
To look at it another way, if you strip off all the fantastic elements,
there should still be a story there we can somehow relate to, make sense of,
etc. All of which comes down to the big question: are the fantastic elements
really necessary? Could Fisher King have been presented in any other way and
still have been as effective? Unlikely. The same goes for Spike Jonze's
Being John Malkovich, a movie which casually asks us to accept that there
might be 'corridors' you can stumble upon which allow temporary access into
another person's mind.
And, in our hero Craig Schwarz' (John Cusack) case, not just any mind, but
one with a face we all know: John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Craig
discovers this corridor when he hires on as file clerk for a company
stationed on the mythical 7˝th floor of a major office building, a floor
which logically shouldn't exist, which is our cue that there's going to be
some serious make-believe going on here. Before Craig even gets to the 7˝th
floor, though, we already know that: can a struggling puppeteer whose wife
takes the family chimp to psychotherapy even have an ordinary adventure? Of
course not. So when we see him crouching his way down the diminutive halls
of his new workplace, dodging the 105-year old lecherous boss (Orson Bean),
exchanging banter with the speech-impeded secretary, it's hardly a surprise.
Or, the surprise is that Being John Malkovich is going further than most
comedies, isn't settling for the traditional quirky character in a sane
world (Don Quixote) or vice-versa (Brazil), but is instead creating
characters who are quirky because that's the only sane response to a
fundamentally quirky world.
It's about survival, which, for Craig, is immediately identified with
romancing cold-shouldered co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), which is
another thing Being John Malkovich casually asks us to accept, or rather,
doesn't really bother to explain. But so be it. She is beautiful, and
'other,' and without pets, so maybe that's all a comedy needs in the way of
justification. After all, this is a movie where a chimpanzee has a flashback
with English subtitles; compared to this, any honest character motivations
would appear minor. And in comedy the focus is always on end results,
anyway, not causes. Causes don't make us laugh; results do. They're the
punchlines. And Being John Malkovich has enough to go around, from selling
tickets to John Malkovich's head ($200 for 15 min. of fame) to the highly
inventive love triangle that Craig and Maxine and Lotte (Craig's wife, a
brunette Cameron Diaz) find themselves in, with the body of John Malkovich
in there somewhere too, unwittingly at first, unwillingly as things
progress.
In the midst of all this, too--at the core of the movie--Craig's getting to
live out every puppeteer's primal fantasy: to be inside the skin of someone
else, which of course is inconsiderate enough that it eventualy has to
backfire, give him an opportunity to learn, occasionally despair, etc. But
it's an entertaining ride while it lasts--Faust with the headlights off. And
does it all work if we take this 'corridor' to function as Craig's
projection? Yes. One way of looking at it is simply as the story of two
people drifting inexorably apart, only one of them is actively trying to
slow things down with a (Schehezeradean) story that eventually spools out of
his control, leaving him stranded first on the New Jersey turnpike, next
somewhere even more unexpected. Another way of looking at is as the most
inventive movie in a long while, one of the few that can string together an
extended series of wholly implausible What Ifs into a marginally coherent
narrative.
And if that's not enough, Being John Malkovich also has the bar-none best
cameo ever: Charlie Sheen as Charlie Sheen, talking about lesbian witches
and how the truth is for suckers, a tall drink in his hand the whole time, a
telling smirk on his face that simply won't go away. The only other movie
this year that can possibly compare with Being John Malkovich would have to
be American Beauty, but that's all the way in the suburbs, leaving Being
John Malkovich in a class of its own. There's simply nothing else quite like
it. It's like finding your own little corridor which opens onto a whole new
world of movie-making, where the rules of mainstream don't hold. Stay as
long as you can.

Screening venue: Cornerhouse (Manchester)
Released in the UK by UIP on March 17, 2000; certificate 15; 112 minutes; 
country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1

Stern, Michael Stipe.
Written by Charlie Kaufman.
Photographed by Lance Acord; edited by Eric Zumbrunnen.
When I first heard the premise of "Being John Malkovich", it was hard to 
accept the reality that one day such a film would be made, and I would be 
able to sit and watch it. Now I've seen it twice -- once last November, at 
the Stella Screen Film Festival, and again this week, at the dawn of its 
general release. But I still haven't quite got my head round it. If I'm not 
giving it four stars, perhaps one of the reasons is that I need to see it a 
few more times before its full force really sinks in.
The movie is like a walk through a long maze of rooms, where each new door 
provides a hilariously bizarre payoff to the last. Consider these opening 
scenes. We meet Craig Schwarz (John Cusack), a scruffy street puppeteer who 
doesn't make much money because his shows are too blasphemous and carnal. His 
wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) encourages him to get an office job until 
marionette work starts to pay; she's raising a chimp, and needs some serious 
cash. Craig becomes employed as a file clerk on floor seven-and-a-half of a 
New York City skyscraper. (The ceilings are very low.) The boss (Orson Bean) 
is a 105-year old pervert obsessed with carrot juice, and his secretary (Mary 
Kay Place) is a paranoid deaf flirt. Even more odd is a hole in the wall of 
Craig's office, which turns out to be a portal into the mind of 
world-renowned actor John Malkovich. It can suck people into the man's brain 
for fifteen minutes and then spit them out onto a ditch on the side of the 
New Jersey Turnpike.
Craig's co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) is determined to exploit the 
discovery. She takes out a classified ad and sells tickets. The next stages 
of the plot involve the other ways she uses the situation, and Malkovich's 
discovery of what's going on. I don't want to reveal too much; this is just 
the set-up, and the movie keeps unfolding with eccentric developments and 
devices, which are so delightful because they seem to emerge out of a 
perfectly logical progression. Every event leads to the next quite 
reasonably, and the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, gives each one a different 
flavour. In one scene near the beginning of the movie, for example, we're 
laughing at the outrageousness of Craig's puppet show. After that enterprise 
fails, and he gets his job on floor seven-and-a-half, the awkward visuals 
inspire giggles. Later there will be clever celebrity satire, when Craig 
figures out how to control Malkovich's body and turns him into a famed 
puppeteer, and we see a TV documentary featuring stars gushing over his 
talents with ludicrous hyperbole.
Spike Jonze, who directed, brings the twisted turns of his picture to life by 
shooting them in dark, dramatic tones with a subtle hand-held camera. It's 
close enough to documentary style to make things somehow plausible, a feeling 
that is encouraged by the actors, who take things seriously and play their 
roles with sincerity. That attitude, as I'm always saying, is necessary for 
comedy to work properly; it's the audacity of the film's situations that 
creates laughter. "Being John Malkovich" has an exciting enough gimmick, in 
that it has its title figure playing a supernatural version of himself. It's 
even more extraordinary to show people entering his mind (including himself), 
developing and acting on sexual attractions within it, and using it as a 
vessel for re-writing history and enjoying everlasting life.
The profound skill of Malkovich's performance doesn't hit our conscious mind 
until after we leave the cinema. As most reviews have pointed out, he creates 
a distinctive character out of his own pompous image, but his more 
complicated scenes are those in which he's been inhabited by other people. 
His adoption of their mannerisms is so committed that we forget he's acting. 
We just believe it. Malkovich is the man onscreen, but we think we're 
watching Cusack, or whoever, walking around in his body.
I am rambling. Exciting films will make me do that. Take it as a strong 
recommendation, and not a sign that I need to take writing classes. And when 
you see "Being John Malkovich", remember to concentrate hard, as paying 
attention to its small details turns out to be very rewarding. Listen 
carefully for names of companies, a mention of a plank of wood, and Orson 
Bean's explanation of why a certain journey cannot be taken after a certain 
deadline. Intriguing? Good.

CAST: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, John Malkovich, Cathrine Keener, Charlie Cheen
Have you ever wanted to be someone else? How about..John Malcovich?
Well, maybe you can
Original. If I would choose one word to describe this film, I would
choose this one. I can guarantee you that you have never seen anything
like that before. Forget formulas, physics and scientific
discoveries. The world is not what it seems!
Craig (John Cusack) is a talented puppeteer, whose ingenious art is
uninteresting in the modern world. He lives in a small apartment with
his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), whose passion for animals invaded the
house. Unappreciated and ignored, Craig decides to switch professions
to make a living. He is then given the opportunity to work as a file
clerk in a Manhattan building. It should also be explained that the
floor of his office building is 7 1/2 . Squeezed in between the
seventh and eighth floors, it's only about 5 feet high, which means
everybody walks around stooped. This adds to the comic weirdness and
the disorientation that are the film's motor.  What follows is one of
film's trippiest pieces of surrealism. Once there, he discovers a
portal that literally sucks him into the mind of John Malkovich. For
brief, virtual-celebrity bursts, he takes in the universe through the
actor's eyes but only for 15 minutes, and then, for some reason, he
gets spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Experience over. But these
15 minutes of borrowed celebrity are about to change his life,
especially when he finds he can repeat it at will by reentering the
portal. What clinches the arc of change is Craig sharing his discovery
with two women - his wife, and Maxine (Catherine Keener), who works in
an office down the hall and has caught Craig's eye. This unexpected
discovery gives them many interesting opportunities. When Maxine hears
about the portal, she manipulates Craig, using his feelings for her to
earn some money by selling trips into John Malkovich's head. In no
time, there's a never ending line of people who, unsure they'll ever
get their own 15 minutes of fame, are eager to pay to get inside
Malkovich...
And then of course the obvious question: Why Malcovich? Perhaps
because Malcovich is exactly that - a symbol of the American dream. A
common man that has made it to the top and thus stands for everything
that modern society requires - glamour, fame, money and automatically
happiness. But it doesn't really matter why exactly Malcovich. We're
all dying to be someone else.
Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is incredibly funny, a sort of modern
visualization of 'Alice in Wonderland' , cheerfully presenting the
universe as God's own pinball machine. But it is also filled with
global questions and heavy philosophy. Several very serious and
frightening themes are posed. Kaufman takes some satirical whacks at
celebrity worship and New Age self-absorption -- "Don't stand in the
way of my self-actualization as a man," Lotte tells Craig. A strange,
paranoiac reaction which occurred to Craig's wife after entering
Malcovich, pretty much the same experience as looking into multiple
mirrors. The film has layer upon layer of things to say about
identity, image, the cult of celebrity, appearance vs. reality, modes
of communication, mass entertainment, contemporary values,
manipulation and even the quest for eternal life. And love as a form
of insanity. It is a frightening tale about the loss of identity, as a
sacrifice to the American dream. We live in a world where everyone
struggle to become the ones that our society idolizes, downplaying the
individuality, until it completely disappears. A society where who you
are is never good enough, and you simply have to be someone else. The
obvious question is of course whether it make your life any
better. According to society it should. But will it?
John Cusack must certainly be one of the greatest actors of his
generation and Cameron Diaz is a funny choice as the sweet, but
physically unattractive Lotte. Cast against type in a completely
different and strange role, Diaz simply shines. Catherine Keener is
likewise a bold and successful choice, looking incredibly right for
the part. Yet, and I know that it sounds strange; it is John Malcovich
who is the star of this film. Playing with a sense of self-parody,
Malcovich portrays a version of John Malcovich that we all probably
imagine, a certain stereotype of a celebrity's life. There is no real
John Malcovich. He is just a vessel, a suit, a mask that anybody can
put on. For Malcovich as an actor this means that he has to copy the
other actors' interpretation of their characters. It seems so easy and
so believable that you never doubt the strange events unfolding before
your eyes. It is a completely different illustration, that makes an
incredible impact on the mind and soul. First-time director Spike
Jonze presents this absurd material in a muted, naturalistic visual
style - unhurried. And the idea of changing bodies becomes as common
as breathing. Look for several amusing cameo roles, such as Charlie
Sheen and Brad Pitt. The film is a hilarious comedy, a demanding
drama, a terrible tragedy. A philosophic, frighteningly prophetic
tale, a dark parody on society, a meditation on human nature. A film
that seems completely against the classic Hollywood entertainment
style and above the familiar 'copy-and-paste' traditions. In simple
words: this is by far one of the greatest achievements of the year and

**** (out of 4) BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is unquestionably the freshest,
most original  yes, I'll say it  best movie of the year. 
In the past, people have appreciated a warning when a movie is best seen
without any foreknowledge, and this movie is one of them. If you're at
all interested, then go see it before you read this or any other review. 
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a surrealist comedy. 
(Surrealism is a movement in art that follows the logic of dreams.
Surrealist images are often funny or absurd, yet they are not purely
comic. There is usually some underlying irrational logic behind them.)
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer (of marionettes) in New
York. That is to say, he's unemployed. Schwartz is very good at it, and
a few scenes of puppeteering (performed by Phil Huber) are quite
impressive, but they don't put food on the table.
Craig is married to Lottie (Cameron Diaz), a naďve, gentle soul who
loves and keeps animals. She works at the pet store to support Craig,
her menagerie, and herself.
Craig's unemployment is becoming a strain on the couple's finances, so
he takes a job as a file clerk. At work, he meets Maxine (Catherine
Keener). He's smitten with her, and she knows it. Whenever they talk,
she always gets right to the point, which as she sees it, is sex. She
strings him along for a while, occasionally letting him buy her a drink.
While filing one day, Craig discovers a little door, like the one Alice
found at the bottom of the rabbit hole. Naturally, he opens the door,
and behind it lies a little tunnel. He crawls through, emerging on the
other side, inside John Malkovich's head. Craig watches in amazement as
his new host travels through the city. After about fifteen minutes, he's
ejected from Malkovich, slimy and dirty, into a ditch on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
He tells his wife about the amazing discovery, and she insists on seeing
for herself. Lottie takes the trip through Malkovich and loves it.
Malkovich has just come out of the shower and is toweling himself off,
which Lottie really likes. Afterwards, Lottie decides that she is a
transsexual.
Back at the office, Craig tells Maxine about the Malkovich portal, and
the two go into business together, selling tickets to the experience.
One day when Lottie is in Malkovich, Maxine gets his number and calls
him (pretending to be an avid fan). She asks him if he would join her
for dinner, and before he can say no, she tells him when and where. Both
Lottie and Malkovich make a note of it. Lottie goes back into Malkovich
that night, hoping she/he will have sex with Maxine.
A jumble of infatuations emerges between Craig, Lottie, and Maxine, with
Malkovich forming the imaginary fourth corner of this space-time love
triangle.
Like in a dream, the human feelings in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH are
ordinary, blunt, and strong. Like in a dream, they are also the key to
understanding what it all means. When you look at how Craig, Lottie, and
Maxine FEEL, you understand what the movie is saying. Actually, the
underlying story is rather mundane.
What makes this movie so great, then, is the surreal detail that adorns
the story, from set design to costumes, to hairstyles.
Although these details are a rich source of conversation and writing
material, I think it best not to say too much. But do know that
the "Malkovich portal" is just the tip of the surreal iceberg floating
in
the film's subconscious.
What I can safely say is the this is director Jonze's first feature
film. Before MALKOVICH he directed commercials and music videos, and
acted in "Three Kings" (as the fourth "king"). The screenwriter is
first-timer Charlie Kaufman. Perhaps it is because they are both novices
that they risked it all and made no compromises.
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has to be seen to be appreciated. No review can do
it justice. It is the kind of well-made, completely original movie that
reminds me why I love going to the movies in the first place.

[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Bradley Null.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5bdc9b968fed6d738825681700177455?OpenDocument
The question on everybody's lips would be: Why John Malkovich?
The centerpiece of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, in case you haven't guessed, is
a portal, which provides the unique opportunity to "be John
Malkovich."   As one character, when approached with the chance,
exuberantly improvises, "Great!  That was my second choice."  Which
leads us right back where we started.  Why John Malkovich?
You've probably guessed that BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a bit off-center as
far as major motion pictures go.  In short, the plot revolves around a
puppeteer (John Cusack) who discovers the aforementioned portal after
assuming a day job as a fileclerk, his homely wife (Cameron Diaz), the
woman he falls hopelessly in love with (Catherine Keener), and the
effects that this portal has on each of these characters, and to a
lesser degree on its host, John Horatio Malkovich (John Malkovich).
The premise isn't the only thing that is odd about this film.  The
characters are odd, (a puppeteer).  The casting is odd, (Cameron Diaz as
homely).  The camera work is best described as claustrophobic.  The
settings are disheveled.  And the two major locations outside of John
Malkovich's psyche, the 7 1/2th floor of an office building, and the
Jersey Turnpike, can only make one wonder what exactly is going on here.
Maybe BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a sociological study.  Maybe it was
intended as an intelligent examination of personal identity, our
society's obsession of being somebody else, and the capitalist
instinct.  More likely it flowered from an intriguing concept in the
mind of first-time screenwriter Charlie Kaufman into an intriguing
story.
There's no denying that BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is definitely a refreshing,
often hilarious story.  Jonze, a unique visionary in music videos and
awards show performances up till now (see Fatboy Slim's choreography in
the 1999 MTV music awards), is without doubt the right man for this
directing job.  The originality of the entire concept will delight all
of you moviegoers out there with an obsessive urge to find something
completely different.  The premise, the plot, and the performances offer
plenty to think about.  But don't think too long, or the despairing
logic it is all built on might collapse.
But you're still wondering: Why John Malkovich?  I couldn't say.
3 stars

     BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is an audacious new comedy that starts
strange, keeps getting stranger, then hits an idea so weird that it
takes the rest of the film to explore only some of the many
ramifications.  "Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry
economic climate," complains Craig Schwartz (played John Cusak) an
out-of-work puppeteer to his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  Craig has been
reduced to street performances of Heloise and Abelard for change, and
even that does not work for him.  Lotte looks and dresses and generally
lives like a hippie.  She works in a pet store and has turned the
Schwartz's modest apartment into a menagerie of distressed animals.  In
his desperate efforts to find work Craig takes a job as a filing clerk
on the seven and a half floor of an office building.  The floor only
about five feet high was created to provide equal access for midgets.
Craig reluctantly settles into his job and starts having designs on the
office beauty, a leggy clerk named Maxine (Catherine Keener).  When
Maxine finds out Craig is a puppeteer his attentions are only a little
less welcome than the strep throat.
     Then Craig discovers that there is a little doorway hidden behind
an office file cabinet.  Behind it lies a dark, damp, gratuitously
Freudian tunnel that drops the trespasser into the mind and body of
John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich).  For fifteen minutes the
visitor sees what Malkovich sees, hears what Malkovich hears, and feels
what Malkovich feels.  Then the visitor is gently dropped from thin air
to the ground next to the New Jersey Turnpike.  For Craig the strange
phenomenon is his inroad to win the attentions of Maxine.  Maxine sees
the Malkovich tunnel as a giant moneymaking opportunity.  When Lotte
tries the tunnel she discovers that she likes to be Malkovich to ...
well that would be telling.
     Charlie Kaufman's script never slows down and never leaves a scene
with the expected.  And only toward the end is the plot so convoluted
that it stops making sense.  Not all the story possibilities are used,
but Kaufman does carry the premise and its ramifications to some
strange extremes.  Different people get different benefits from the
Malkovich ride.  Some visitors want to try just being in another body;
some want a taste of the Malkovich life style.  Malkovich's finely
appointed, but sterile and lifeless apartment is a stark contrast to
Craig's cluttered low-rent apartment teeming with animals and life.
Other people want to share the actor's sex life.
     John Cusak seems to have a taste for intelligent humor and takes
to his role with gusto.  For some reason he looks as seedy as he has
ever looked on the screen.  Cameron Diaz, who has been alluring in most
of her other films here is almost unrecognizably frumpy in a mop of
flyaway hair.  They are both made as unglamorous as possible to define
their rank in society and to contrast with Catherine Keener, one of the
beautiful people who can have a lover like Malkovich for the asking.
And the old doctor with a voice like Orson Bean really is played by
Orson Bean.
     At last something new and original in a movie.  This is a film as
fresh and entertaining as was the story ALICE IN WONDERLAND when it was
new.  It would be nice if following the lead of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH
filmmakers would realize that you could start with some really crazy
premise, possibly fantasy, and just follow it to wherever it leads.  I
rate BEING JOHN MALKOVICH a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4
to +4 scale.
     Maybe someone who knows more about the state of marionette
techniques than I do.  Can a good puppeteer really make a marionette do
a somersault and not get the strings tangled up.  Questions unanswered:
Is there a separate in-house documentary about the seventh floor?
After all we know from the outside of the building that the floors
started out all the same height, so they must have divided the seventh
floor.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief for that; I was even
willing to suspend my disbelief on the major premises of the film.  But
one thing is minor premise goes a little too far.  I find it very
difficult to believe that without benefit of a magical tunnel anybody
could get from an office building in Manhattan to the New Jersey
Turnpike in only fifteen minutes.
     When Malkovich enters the tunnel the result is a really bizarre
scene borrowed from a "Twilight Zone" episode, but it is totally
unsatisfying as what would be seen.  I was expecting to see an ever-
diminishing tunnel or repetitions, not unlike the mirror scene in
CITIZEN KANE.  But my question is what did the Japanese tourist who was
in the tunnel with him see.  I assume from the script that Malkovich
really has never played a jewel thief.  However the reference to him
playing someone mentally retarded was probably to his performance as
Lenny in John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN (1992).

When you go see movies on a regular basis, you are bound to become more savvy 
in the calculations of any one story, being able to pinpoint elements that 
have been done just a few too many times in previous films for it to be 
surprising or particularly memorable. Sometimes, you want to see a movie so 
that it will take you on some sort of journey that has never, or rarely, been 
taken before in the world of film. 
Such is the case with director Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich," which is 
bound to be one the most unusual motion pictures of 1999. And I don't mean in 
a David Lynchian sort of way, because while it may have hints of that "Twin 
Peaks" helmer's trademark weirdness and peculiarities, it has an overall 
style all its own. Just the thought that someone actually conjured up such an 
inventive tale (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman) gives hope for further 
innovative motion pictures that may be struggling through the pipeline simply 
because they are too "strange" to actually be made. In that respect, "Being 
John Malkovich" is groundbreaking in its sheer abandon of conventional plots, 
and in its embrace of nothing but complete originality.
While the story may seem confusing, it surprisingly makes total sense (well, 
at least as much of it as one can possibly understand). Ultimately, one could 
even see how, in lesser hands, this film could have been disastrous. Its 
tricky tone was, no doubt, difficult to perfect, as it is an out-and-out 
fantasy, but set in a very realistic present day New York City, yet relies on 
its offbeat humor to pull off the act. In fact, the comedy needed to be 
successful because, otherwise, the film would have just been too 
preposterous. One of the delights about "Being John Malkovich" is how very 
funny it is--easily one of the most laugh-inducing I've seen this year--and 
once the viewer settles into its oddball tone, the film entertains, excites, 
and is even thought-provoking in its handling of such issues as identity 
discovery and the manipulation over others.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a down-on-his-luck master puppeteer without a 
job and much money, living in a Manhattan apartment with his pet store-owning 
and animal-loving wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Tired of his life going nowhere, 
Craig finds an ad in the classifieds and answers the position of a filing 
clerk--on the 7 1/2th floor of an office building, where the ceiling is just 
four feet high. The inhabitants of the floor are an unusual bunch, including 
Floris (May Kay Place), the hearing-impaired secretary who misunderstands 
almost everything a person says and, yet, believes it is not she, but them 
that have the handicap; and the 105-year-old boss, Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), 
who is convinced Floris cannot understand him because he has a speech 
impediment (when Craig tells Dr. Lester that he can understand him perfectly 
fine, his reply is, "Flattery will get you nowhere with me."). And then 
there's Maxine (Catherine Keener), an alluring, beautiful woman whom Craig 
instantly falls head over heels for, even though the feeling is clearly not 
mutual.
One day, when Craig accidentally drops a file behind a stack of cabinets in 
his office, he removes them from the wall to find a small doorway, large 
enough to crawl through. Opening it up and venturing inside the seemingly 
never-ending tunnel, a force abruptly blows him through the portal, and he 
suddenly finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich, peering through 
his eyes--but only for a 15-minute period--after which he is dumped upon the 
embankment next to the New Jersey Turnpike. It's a bit tricky to say much 
more, in fear of giving away too much (even though, believe me, I haven't 
even scratched the surface), but suffice to say, in a plot to make money, 
Craig and Maxine start their own business where anyone can go into 
Malkovich's mind for $200 a pop. Meanwhile, Craig and Lotte both become 
addicted to being able to take over the identity of another person, sparked 
by their unhappiness in the lives they currently lead.  
One might wonder why John Malkovich, playing a version of himself very well, 
is the celebrity that was chosen as the subject of the film, but it does sort 
of have a symmetry to it, since he is a consistently well-received actor who 
the casual filmgoer most likely has heard of, but knows nothing about. A 
running joke in the film is that the characters can't think of any movies 
he's been in, even though they seem to remember him playing a jewel thief. 
The ingenious idea of being able to get inside the mind of another human 
being is something I do not recall ever being done before, and while 
obviously far-fetched, the film is realistic in its portrayal of people who 
find themselves being swept away by the thought of being someone else, 
someone more successful and respected than they are.
The three central characters are portrayed by a talented crop of actors who 
take every role they play, and run with them. John Cusack is very good as 
Craig, a man with very little self-esteem and bad posturing (he walks slumped 
over, even when not on the 7 1/2th floor). Of the three major roles, however, 
Craig is the least interesting and flashy one, and he doesn't go through as 
much of an internal transformation like the others do. Cusack is flawlessly 
cast and does a fine job with what he is given, but if there is an 
underwritten role here, it is his.
When Cameron Diaz first appeared on the scene in 1994's "The Mask," it's 
difficult to believe anyone could have suspected she was such a stunningly 
diverse talent, not to mention one of the most intelligent actresses of her 
generation. Diaz can star as the likable love interest in a blockbuster film 
(1998's "There's Something About Mary"), but is just as likely to try 
something a little more risky and challenging (a crazed, self-absorbed 
bride-to-be in 1998's "Very Bad Things"). With "Being John Malkovich," Diaz 
gives her most assured performance to date, as the frizzy-haired, frumpy 
Lotte, and is nearly unrecognizable compared to the beauty she really is. In 
a plot development that won't be revealed here, Lotte comes to a 
life-altering realization after her first trip inside John Malkovich's mind. 
While outrageous on first thought, it is also oddly believable and wholly 
makes sense when you think about it in the context of the character.
Catherine Keener, a marvel to behold in every single film she appears in, 
exudes an outer iciness on first appearance, as Maxine, but wisely is 
developed into a confused and lonely three-dimensional character by the 
film's second half. Working in the world of indie films for several years, 
Keener is just now breaking out into bigger roles in more high-profile 
projects, and good for her. She deserves all the attention she is just 
starting to receive.
The writing, by Charlie Kaufman, is full of such intelligent, dry wit and 
appropriately goofy ideas, that the film is a comic goldmine, even among the 
more serious aspects of the story. The opening sections, especially, almost 
had me on the verge of completely breaking down at the thought of its sheer 
hilarity. Director Spike Jonze (who had an impressive acting role as the 
fourth king in "Three Kings") proves here to be one of the most exciting and 
fresh current filmmakers, and kudos to him for obtaining the willpower and 
courage to film such a purely individualistic creation. "Being John 
Malkovich" is a stunner through-and-through, and can safely stand as one of 
the very best motion pictures of the season.

A puppeteer discovers a portal into the head of John Malkovich.
    Have you ever been to the supermarket and seen a tabloid headline
screaming `Julia Roberts to have Richard Simmons
lovechild!'? Me neither, thank God, but you've probably seen one just as
ludicrous, haven't you? Most of us see such headlines
and laugh, knowing that tabloids are trash with no basis in fact. A day
or two later, if someone mentions Julia Roberts (to use
my example), you find yourself joking `Hey, yeah, I read that she is
having Simmons' baby!' and you all share a chuckle.
However, underneath such light banter there is an undercurrent of true
curiosity. Secretly, many of us wonder just what Julia
Roberts was REALLY doing in that fuzzy photograph. Our Western culture
is fascinated by the minutiae of our celebrities'
daily lives. Sure, you can dismiss those tabloid headlines, but if
people didn't believe them, those papers wouldn't exist. In fact,
the size of the subscription lists of The Enquirer and The Star prove
it; we can't leave these people alone, because they aren't
people... they are celebrities!
    Being John Malkovich, the remarkable new film by Spike Jonze,
examines this fascination with celebrity and takes us to its
inevitable end: a portal that actually takes you inside of a celebrity,
allowing you to be that star, for fifteen minutes. As the title
suggests, the star in question is John Malkovich, a perfect choice for
the film due to the smaller stature of his star compared to
Robin Williams or Brad Pitt. By casting a star whose filmography isn't
as well-known to the average American, Jonze can
reveal another side to the celebrity issue, the fact that in some cases,
we aren't even aware of why celebrities are celebrities.
    As we watch Malkovich's life from behind his own eyes, we are shown
a world where people can't resist greeting the star,
quickly revealing that they actually have little knowledge of his work.
One cab driver compliments John by saying `Hey, weren't
you in that film? You know, the one where you played a jewel thief? I
loved that movie, Mr. Malkovich.' When Malkovich
mentions that he has never played a jewel thief, the cab driver doesn't
really care. Such is the problem with celebrity; it is your
status as a star that is what the public drools over, not you.
    The portal into Malkovich's brain is discovered by Craig, a nerdy
puppeteer (Cusack) working for a bizarre filing company.
The portal is hidden in deep storage, and upon entering it, he finds
himself seeing through John Malkovich's eyes. However,
after fifteen minutes he gets dumped onto the side of the New Jersey
Turnpike (an unfortunate side effect of the portal). This
discovery changes his life, along with the lives of his
animal-infatuated wife Lotte (Diaz) and his co-worker Maxine (Keener).
The three of them discover a kind of erotic thrill in both a) being John
Malkovich, and b) actually meeting and talking to the real
thing, knowing that one of the others is inside his head watching.
    The three actors (Cusack, Diaz and Keener) were given free reign
with their characters, and it shows. Cusack's Craig goes
from being a pathetic-but-cute loser, to a disturbing and slightly scary
man, to an unlikable bastard. Diaz switches back and
forth from quiet victim to sexual thrill-rider, to gun-wielding
madwoman. Keener's Maxine remains fairly consistent as a cold
stand-offish woman from start to near-finish, only enjoying life when
she is in control. Only Malkovich is fully convincing as he
lampoons his image and has a lot of fun with the role.
    The story, written by Charlie Kaufman is original and fun. No one
aspect of the film is `normal' per se. The office Craig
works in is on the 7 and a half floor. To reach it involves stopping an
elevator midway between floors, and to move around
involves stooping. Craig's boss Dr. Lector is a 105 year old with a
penchant for talking of his sexual desires. Craig's street
puppet shows are often lewd, inspiring parents to become violent.
Lotte's pet chimp even gets his own flashback, to a time
before he was taken out of the jungle. Many films have unexpected scenes
of this calibre (a scene from Go comes to mind in
which a stoned young man have a telepathic conversation with a cat), but
seldom to films come this close to being 100%
strange.
    The film has only one real problem, and that is with the final third
of the story. Once the novelty of the idea begins to wear
off, Being John Malkovich gets a little boring. Too much time is spent
on Lotte's quest to find out the origins of the portal,
Craig's attempts to stay in Malkovich for longer lengths of time, and
the result once he finds out how. By the time the film ends,
in a chilling and dark manner, the audience is glad, for really, its
attention was mostly lost half an hour earlier.
    In the end, Being John Malkovich makes a strong point. Once the
veneer of celebrity aloofness is taken away from a star,
they are no longer any different than the rest of us. Once Maxine gets
too used to being around Malkovich, she tires of him. It
reminds us that these are people, people who merely appear different
because we choose to see them as different. While its
story lags in the end, Being John Malkovich is one of the year's most
interesting and appealing films. Anyone tired of the
formulaic, familiar mediocrity that represents most of Hollywood these
days should run to see this film. It is like none other I
have ever seen, and the same will hold for you.
