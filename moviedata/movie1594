I am not a fan of _South_Park_--never have been, likely never will be.  So
I was surprised to find myself laughing during the early moments of this
big screen comedy written, directed, and starring the popular adult
animated series's co-creator (with Matt Stone, who also has a small role
here), Trey Parker.  He plays Joe Young, an innocent door-to-door Mormon
preacher who unwittingly finds himself an adult film superstar after
naively agreeing to play the title role in a pornographic superhero flick
called _Orgazmo_.
But as amusing as the setup and a few jokes (an old lady's F-word-ridden
tirade about Mormons, a title card reading "Hollywood" appearing on a shot
of the Hollywood sign) are, recurring gags that initially garner a giggle
wear thin fast.  An ebonics-spouting Asian sushi bar owner named G-Fresh
(Masao San) is funny the first time we see him, the joke grows old with
each subsequent appearance.  The same can be said for the knowingly cheesy
chopsocky action scenes and Orgazmo sidekick Choda-Boy's (Dian Bachar) vast
array of dildo-derived gadgets.  (The pervasive presence of sex toys
undoubtedly factored in the MPAA's decision to brand this crude but quite
tame film with an overly restrictive NC-17 rating.)  Before long, the
entirety of the film follows suit, straining to fill the rest of its slim
90-minute running time with a dull subplot in which Joe must fight off some
heavies harassing G-Fresh.
What is consistently funny, however, are the songs on soundtrack.  The
Parker-penned opening theme, "Now You're a Man," is a hilarious parody of
"macho" hard rock ("What makes a man?/Is it the woman in his hands/Just
'cause she has big titties?").  Even better is the closing tune, a bossa
nova groove that is quite seductive... until it gets to the hilariously
absurd title lyric, which is repeated ad nauseum in the chorus: "Sorry
about your penis."

ORGAZMO (1997)  1/2 * Written, directed, edited by Trey Parker. Produced by
Fran Rubel Kuzui, Jason McHugh, Matt Stone. Photography,  Kenny Gioseffi.
Cast: Trey Parker (the Elder Joe Young), Matt Stone (the other Elder), Dian
Bachar (Choda-Boy), Michael Dean Jacobs (Maxxx Orbison), Robyn Raab (Lisa),
Ron Jeremy (Clark), Masao ``Maki'' San (G-Fresh), et al. An October
Pictures release. 90 minutes. Rated NC-17 (sex, language)
Whenever a multiplex schedules a 90-minute feature for just two shows a
day, it means that the film is either "art" that does not draw mainstream
audiences, or "dreck" that cannot even find an infantile public. Orgazmo is
the latter.
Comedy is the hardest genre to make. Within comedy, the subgenre of
parodies is even harder. Within that subgenre, spoofing films that are
themselves parodies, intentionally or not, is a lost cause. This applies to
a host of films, including pornographic, and especially cheap pornos.
Orgazmo's intent  to parody cheap porno-flicks falls pancake-flat, though
not cheesecake-flat.
Two young, clean-cut Mormon Elders are trying to spread the good word in
Los Angeles.
When they chance on the mansion-cum-studio of porn-maker Maxxx Orbison
(note the xxx) the reception is rough. One Elder flees, the other, Joe
Young, highly proficient in martial arts, fights Maxxx's goons. The
sequence, meant to be funny, is not. Nor is it choreographed a la Hong
Kong.
Maxxx, impressed by Joe, immediately offers him the title role in the
picture he is shooting, the part of Orgazmo, a superstud and superfighter
who has a diminutive side-kick, Choda-Boy. (A parody of Batman and Robin).
For two days' work in his quickie, Maxx goes from his usual fee of $300 to
$20,000. Joe refuses but then everyone has his price. He finally accepts
because he and his fiancee Lisa dream of a wedding in the pricey Salt Lake
City's Mormon Tabernacle. Joe's main stipulation is that there will be a
stand-in actor (or phallus) for the sex acts.
Joe's name is, of course, a reference to the King-Kongish ape in the film
"Mighty Joe Young." Maxxx rebaptizes him Joe Hung. Ain't all that funny?
The rest of the film is an aimless bore, clearly improvised from scene to
scene. The flick is a mega-hit  that Maxx wants to make sequel after
sequel. There's a kind of sub-plot about other henchmen of Maxxx's (he's a
kind of Mafioso on the side) who take over by force a sushi-bar;  a bit
more relevant is the relation of Joe and Lisa who regularly speak on the
phone starting with "Jesus love you and I love you."
Joe, who majored in theater from Brigham Young University ,sinfully lies to
Lisa by pretending he is extending his stay in L.A. to be in Death of a
Salesman. Naive Lisa eventually comes to visit and...and...
I knew nothing about filmmaker Troy Parker but  finally found out that he
is about 28, has been variously active in movies and is the co-maker of
TV's series South Park. Since, on TV, I mostly watch PBS, the History
Channel, old films and the better ones I have missed, I was unaware that
South Park was an animation about little kids who use vulgar language, and
that the shows have made Parker famous in some quarters.
Orgazmo does have a small sprinkling of jokes (the "best " ones verbal
rather than graphic) which could bring on some chuckles depending on the
viewer's standards for humor. But as an entity, this flick is plain Dumb
and Dumber, part II of which, yet unreleased, was written by, guess
who?....Trey Parker.
I suppose that the unusual rating of NC-17 was welcomed by Mr. Parker. It
promises raunchy audiovisual excitement to potential adult audiences and to
underage kids who'll sneak in. But in fact, the movie's sex scenes show no
real sex acts and are so broad and un-detailed that they are as inoffensive
as The Three Stooges, which the film does feel like.  The use of a
toy-like, orgasm-producing ray gun invented by Choda-Boy (he has two
scientific Ph.D. degrees from M.I.T.!) is also inoffensively shown. Nudity
exists minimally, mostly as the sight of men's hairy behinds.
The bottom (no pun meant) line is that the NC-17 must be the result of the
film's steady mockery of the Mormons. Otherwise, you can see infinitely
more sexually explicit films on cable, including Cinemaxxx.

Cast: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, Michael Dean Jacobs, Ron
Jeremy, Lloyd Kaufman
Written and Directed by: Trey Parker
Running Time: 94 minutes
Crude, low-budget comedy from Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators
of Comedy Central's smash hit "South Park".  Filmed before "South
Park" became a big hit, but released after Stone and Parker's summer
1998 effort BASEketball, Orgazmo tells the tale of Joe Young (Trey
Parker), a mormon on a trip to Hollywood who gets mixed up in the
adult film industry after knocking on the wrong door.  Eventually,
Young becomes both a superstar in the business, as well as a crime
fighting superhero.
Orgazmo is certainly crude (it's rated NC-17), but nothing in the film
really offended me in any way.  It's definately low-brow humor from
start to finish, but even low-brow humor can be done well.  Of course
I could have done without seeing the "T-Rex" character or the rampant
shots of naked male ass... which yes, I understand is part of the
overall joke of the film, but still...
You'd probably never think that a parody of both porn and of martial
arts films would be cohesive enough to be entertaining, but Orgazmo
manages to pull it off.  Sure with these kinds of movies most of the
jokes are hit and miss, but enough of the jokes work here, therefore
making it a pretty entertaining flick for fans of Parker and Stone.

*** (out of 4) Trey Parker is a very talented filmmaker. ORGAZMO was
made cheaply, and it shows. But even without a lot of money, Parker put
together a solid comedy with great writing, good directing, and
surprisingly good acting all around. 
Joe Young (Parker) is a Mormon, going door-to-door for converts in L.A.
Joe knocks on the door of Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), a porn
director who gets so angry at the interruption that he sends his thugs
out to beat up the visitor. But Joe knows some moves and singlehandedly
beats Maxxx's thugs. Maxxx is so impressed he asks Joe to act in his
next movie. 
Joe learns what kind of movie Maxxx was talking about and starts to turn
him down, but the money is too good to pass up - by taking the part, Joe
would have enough money to marry his sweetheart in the temple in Salt
Lake City. When Maxxx suggests that a stuntman can do all the dirty work
so Joe can remain a virgin, Joe's moral objections dry up. Joe becomes
ORGAZMO, the pornographic superhero whose secret weapon is the
"orgazmorator." 
Joe's co-star Ben, aka "Choda Boy" (Dian Bachar), has two PhDs from MIT,
but enjoys working as a porn star. When he's not at work, he's inventing
things in his basement. One of his inventions is the orgazmorator, just
like in the porn films, but this one really works. Joe and Ben's lives
start to parallel Orgazmo and Choda Boy's as the two team up to fight
crime. 
Orgazmo is a very funny film. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie
since... well... THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Granted, that's not very
long ago, but you get the point. 
Part of the reason is the sheer silliness of the movie. There are tons
of cheap jokes, and most of them work beautifully - credit Parker as
director, writer, and co-editor for that. Most of the jokes are visual
(like Choda Boy's costumes or Young's reaction to the industry's common
practices). But in addition there are some solidly funny ideas. 
For example, if Joe just SAID he was a Mormon, it would be a single,
funny joke: ha-ha, move on to the next one. But Joe really is a Mormon
(or at least the comic equivalent). His constant naivete and sincerity
make the whole CHARACTER funny, all the way through the film. The fact
that he never compromises his own morality gives the movie internal
consistency and makes the whole of the movie seem even funnier. 
And there are some surprisingly good performances, especially
considering that this is a cheap, rookie movie (it is Parker's second as
director). 
Parker makes the perfect comic hero. He conveys shock, wholesomeness,
and chivalry with great exaggeration, but without carrying the
performance into sarcasm and cynicism. 
Bachar is wonderful as Choda Boy, the movie's straight man (no pun
intended). He has some of the funniest lines in the film and has to
endure the most ridiculous costumes. There were times when I wondered
how anyone could keep a straight face, but Bachar managed to pull it
off. 
The other big role, that of Maxxx probably wasn't too challenging, and
Jacobs was thankfully good in the part. There were dozens of other small
parts, and not a single one of them left a bad actor taste. 
ORGAZMO is rated NC-17, but don't let that stigmatize it for you (it
probably should have been an R). The comedy is very mainstream and there
is no full frontal nudity (though there are several ... ahem...
artificial members). It's difficult to make a convincing argument for
how funny a movie is without giving away the jokes. But trust me, this
movie is very funny. If you are at all titillated - and not too easily
offended - go see this movie.

Orgazmo is a movie that feels like one of those "before they were
famous" photos. Made by the creators of South Park, before that show
ever hit the air, this spoof of "adult" films and kung-fu movies shows
some comic potential, but it just misses the mark.
Elder Joe Young (Trey Parker) is the stereotypical clean-cut Mormon,
doing his mission work on the seedy side of L.A.  One day, he has the
misfortune to accidentally interrupt the shooting of a porno film.  The
director, Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), sics his goons upon Joe.
But when Joe defends himself with some impressive kung-fu moves, Maxxx
hires him on the spot.
Now, Joe has a few moral issues with starring in a pornographic film.
But, since Joe desperately needs the money for his upcoming marriage to
his sweet fiancee Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab), he is able to look past the
ethics (besides, it's only acting).  And so, Joe becomes the porn star,
Captain Orgazmo.
However, things begin to get strange when his real life identity and his
alter ego start to converge.  Ben (Dian Bachar), Captain Orgazmo's
sidekick Choda-Boy, is a closet genius, inventing all sorts of
techno-gadgets. When a group of thugs threaten Ben's friend G-Fresh
(Masao "Maki" San), Joe and Ben must become Captain Orgazmo and
Choda-Boy to thwart the evildoers and their evil scheme.
If all this sounds rather odd, and in poor taste, well, it is.  This IS
from the makers of South Park, after all.  However, few of the jokes
here seem inspired...most are blatantly obvious, and only a few are
funny.
Surprisingly, the best parts of the film are when it is spoofing the
kung fu genre, rather than its outlandish soft porn.  Simple gags, such
as Ben's mystical "hamster-style" martial arts provide much of the
film's humor.
But, unfortunately, it's not enough to support the whole film.  Even
with a relatively short running time, the film quickly gets repetitive.
This one might make a good midnight movie on cable...but it's not worth
the effort at your local movie theater.

Orgazmo, a gleefully insulting and intentionally awful porn satire,
centers around an upstanding Mormon lad named Joe Young.  Created by and
starring Trey Parker, the film explains the unlikely events leading to
Joe's stardom in a pornographic film.  It all begins one day as he's
going door-do-door in Los Angeles; he knocks on a door and interrupts
progress on a porn flick.  After Joe beats up a bunch of henchmen (he
kicks butt for the Lord), the film's director, Maxxx Orbison (Michael
Dean Jacobs) decides that Joe is perfect for the starring role in his
film (which, incidentally, is also called Orgazmo). 
Because he needs money to marry his fiancée, Lisa (Robyn Lynn Raab),
Joe reluctantly accepts the job.  Orbison guarantees that Joe's
innocence is preserved by enlisting a "stunt cock" for the penetration
shots, and by allowing him to skimp on the expletives littered in the
dialogue.  Soon, however, it turns out that Orbison is into dirty work,
and all he wants is money.  With the help of his co-star and friend,
Choda Boy (Dian Bachar), Joe ultimately becomes a real superhero and
attempts to stop the evil doings of Orbison.
If you take Orgazmo seriously, you might think it's the worst film of
1998.  I've read reviews that describe it as poorly-made and
incompetent, but those critics are simply missing the point:  Orgazmo is
*intentionally* bad.  The wooden acting is there for a reason.  The
cheesy fight scenes serve a purpose.  The dialogue is laughable because
it needs to be.  Besides, the setup gives everything away -- does Parker
really expect us to take seriously the story of a Mormon porn star?  Of
course he doesn't, and that's why the film is often successful:  it is
so completely bad that we're *never* inclined to take it seriously.
For the first hour, Orgazmo is fresh and entertaining.  The way Parker
parodies pornographic films is skillfully done:  porn flicks are known
for their awful acting and pointless storylines, and Parker, going
over-the-top with awful acting and pointless storylines, manages to make
a lot of lively fun out of the satire.  The film opens with a brilliant
musical number (I'd repeat the lyrics, but this is a family-oriented
site).  Many of the sequences illicit big belly laughs -- the subplot
with a ghetto sushi-chef is terrific, and the scene in which an old lady
curses at the Mormons is hilarious.
Orgazmo is a lot smarter than it seems.  It makes a pretty bold attack
on the Mormon belief system; it also steers successfully away from
self-satire by avoiding exploitation of sex (all we get to see are a few
naked breasts and a plethora of dildos).  Most of the acting is
deviously clever; Parker is really funny (he even showed talent in
BASEketball) and perfect for the lead.  The other performances work
because the performers obviously know that they're overacting.  Bachar,
who was also in BASEketball, is great in a bad sort of way, while Raab,
as the fiancée, is perfectly perky.  The only performance that doesn't
work is Jacobs' Orbison; he's often difficult to watch, and he's not
very funny.
The problem with Orgazmo is that it recycles its own jokes in the final
half hour, and the result is a picture that overstays its welcome. 
Parker starts off with a lot of original ideas, but keeps giving them to
us as if they're new.  So, by the time Joe and Choda Boy are
infiltrating Orbison's fortress, the story is no longer funny and
strikes us mostly as really silly.  Even so, I enjoyed Orgazmo -- Parker
has proven to me that he has an innovative mind when it comes to
comedy.  Any film so cheerfully bad should be admired on some level, but
the humor in Orgazmo surpasses its own badness.

      Before Trey Parker struck success with TV's "South Park," he
made a dreadful, scatological, NC-17 satire of parasitic, hard-core
pornography.  In this offensive opus, Parker plays a mild-mannered
Mormon missionary who agrees to appear in a porno film with Ron Jeremy
(a real-life porno star) in order to earn $20,000 so that he can be
married in the temple in Salt Lake City. Reassured that there will be
a "stunt penis" for penetration, he accepts the role of the XXX-rated
superhero Orgazmo, who crashes through cardboard walls to rescue
damsels who are being ravished by Jeremy. His secret weapon is his
Orgazmorator which stuns his enemies with multiple orgasms. Meanwhile,
his virginal fiancee (Robyn Lynne Raab) in Utah is curious about the
film, so the missionary says it's "Death of a Salesman." Intrigued,
she flies to Southern California, where she's soon kidnapped and tied
to a bed by the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed film-maker (Michael Dean
Jacobs).  The lame, shoddy, infantile excitement is confined to a huge
German shepherd humping a man's leg and a gray-haired granny swearing
like a Marine drill sergeant. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Orgazmo" is barely a 1. No yucks and a yawn - a dud.

ORGAZMO
(Rogue)
Starring:  Trey Parker, Dian Bachar, Robyn Lynne Raab, Michael Dean
Jacobs, Matt Stone.
Screenplay:  Trey Parker.
Producers:  Fran Rubel Kuzui, Jason McHugh, Matt Stone.
MPAA Rating:  NC-17 (sexual content, profanity, adult themes, violence)
Running Time:  95 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     It's the film so daring that it earned a rare NC-17 rating!  It's the
film so controversial that Universal Pictures, the parent company of
October Films, forced October to create a separate releasing arm to
distance itself from the film!  It's the film so outrageous that only
Trey Parker, the bad-boy co-creator of "South Park," could have brought
it to you!  It's ORGAZMO, a film destined for midnight movie immortality!
     They say there's no such thing as bad publicity...unless you're a
potential film viewer who pays attention to it.  Anyone expecting naughty,
edgy fun from ORGAZMO might find that its most shocking surprise is how
uninspired much of its "outrageousness" is.  Sure, it hits two guaranteed
hot-buttons -- religion and sex -- in this tale of a naive Mormon lad
named Joe Young (played by Parker himself) serving a mission in Los
Angeles.  One day he knocks on the wrong door, and ends up on the set of
porno film director Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs).  Impressed by 
Joe's martial arts skills when he fends off a group of bodyguards, Orbison
offers Joe the lead role of Captain Orgazmo (physical stunts only, no sex
required), along with a huge paycheck which will allow Joe and his fiancee
Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab) to marry in the Salt Lake City temple and live
well.  Oh, and Joe also becomes a _real_ crime-fighting super-hero who
uses a high-tech weapon to paralyze adversaries with intense sexual
pleasure.
     Occasionally, it looks like Parker is going to take this story on
just the right avenue of absurdity.  The film-within-the-film "Orgazmo"
turns out to be a crossover smash hit, ranking third on the all-time box
office chart and naturally creating demand for a sequel.  Then there's the
odd little aside in which Joe's film sidekick Ben (Dian Bachar) re-lives a
painful childhood memory of giving up "hamster style" martial arts, and a
cameo appearance by a certain heavenly personage.  There are a few amusing
gags sprinkled throughout ORGAZMO, many aimed at the absurdity of adult
film "plot" scenarios when they're not taking broad shots at Utah or the
Latter-Day Saints.
     The problem with Parker's sense of humor is that it can be terribly
lazy.  His favorite set-up involves wacky character incongruities which
actually lost most of their wackiness many iterations ago -- an old woman
swearing like a sailor, an old woman showing sexual arousal, a Japanese
sushi chef who uses hip-hop lingo.  His running gags include brilliant
innovations like a surly porno actor who passes gas in the face of others
("South Park's" Terence and Philip, eat your hearts out), and a lighting
technician (Parker's cohort Matt Stone) who begins every sentence with "I
don't want to seem like a queer or nothin'..." until eventually --
inevitably -- he actually makes a pass at another male character.  You can
see punch lines coming from several theaters away in ORGAZMO.
     Those who might attend just for prurient interest should also be
warned that ORGAZMO is about as tame as an NC-17 film could get.  Though
there's plenty of full-clothed grinding and prominent displays of certain
marital aids, there's nary an exposed female body part to be found (hairy
male buttocks, on the other hand, get a disturbing amount of screen time).
Make no mistake, Trey Parker's brand of offensiveness is far more
sniggering, middle-of-the-road crude than it is truly shocking.  There's
nothing wrong with the production being sloppy and amateurish; after all,
this is among other things a parody of porno films, with a wonderfully
cheesy fake explosion for a conclusion.  It's another thing when the humor
is often sloppy and amateurish...or worse yet, re-cycled.  ORGAZMO
inspires the one reaction a "daring," "controversial," "outrageous" film
can't afford:  a great big "so what?"

ORGAZMO
Directed and written by Trey Parker
Starring  Trey Parker, Dian Bachar, Masad `Maki' San
Running time  94 min. (may be cut for R rating)
PLOT:
              Parker plays Joe Young, a naďve Mormon who
cheerfully goes from house to house hoping to spread
the word of Christ.  He soon finds himself at the house
of porn director, Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs).
Joe gets into a fight outside the house, and Orbison is
so impressed with his skills that he persuades him to
play the super hero, Orgazmo in his new movie
Orgazmo.  Hesitant at first, Joe accepts because he
needs the money to get married to his fiancé.
CRITIQUE:
              Parker's first feature, with his partner Matt Stone,
was Cannibal: The Musical, a hilarious, low-budget film
made for Troma (and the reason Parker left college).
Orgazmo shows Parker's growth as a writer and director,
and proves to be one of the funniest comedies to come...
echem...along in awhile.
              Parker and Stone's careers basically began
because of the intense bootleg distribution of their
vulgar, 5 min., animated masterpiece, The Spirit of
Christmas', which had Jesus fighting Santa Claus over
the true' meaning of Christmas.  This short spawned
the animated phenomenon known as South Park.
Mere shock value' is a phrase that is often used to
describe the reason behind the popularity of their
program.  Perhaps the same words will be used by
critics to describe this picture.
    The problem with the term shock value', is that it
often suffocates the true comedic value and reduces the
picture to nothing more than outrageousness.  It's a
knee-jerk label that many easily offended people give
when viewing work that deals with subject matter that
they'drather not view.  This is fairly evident as the film
received an NC-17 (which would pretty much butcher it's
distribution potential, so it must be cut to make the R).
               However, despite the subjects Parker has
chosen to tackle as backdrops for his comedy, his wit
and originality is always present in all he's worked on
and hopefully will get noticed moreso than his subjects.
               The main strength of the comedy is its lack of
duds'.  Just about every joke Parker goes for works,
and every now and then he gets something that really'
works.  Few of those latter jokes could be described in this
review without lessening the impact of an actual viewing,
however one physical gag sticks out in my mind and
involves a character named T-RexThat is all I will say.
               An interesting Parker used a few actual porn stars
in the film, either as an inside joke for those of us who know
who Ron Jeremy (of Anal Al's Adventures fame) is, or to
instill an important sense of realism that can only be
achieved by porn stars playing porn stars.  Also adding
some Spice in the film is Chasey Lain and Boraca the
Brazilian Bombshell.
               The film has a simplicity about it, and perhaps that
is it's biggest forte.  Many comedies try to be big, with the
misconception that bigger is better, and while I'm sure many
actors in this film would hold that belief, it is my
experience that forced and unnecessary grandeur often
obscures pure comedy and its subtleties.  Then again,
perhaps the simplicity is due mainly to budget restraints
well, whatever the reasonit works.  It is not the most
satirical, nor the most intelligent script ever written, but it
did it's jobit was funny.  Parker obviously has confidence
in his work and sense of humor.  As a result, the pacing
never becomes flaccid.  It may be somewhat immature, it
may contain some mediocre choices in running gags, and
maybe an elderly lady humping her walker could be
considered in bad tastebut it's all in good fun.
               Another interesting character assignment is Dian
Bachar as Ben Chapleski (aka Choda Boy).  In Cannibal:
The Musical, Dian played a virgin whose main hope in life
was to get laid.  In Orgazmo, as Ben, Dian finally gets to
see some action.  Another character returning from
Cannibal is Masad "Maki" San, who impeccably portrays
G-Fresh...
               As a side-note, the hilarious theme song, `Now
You're a Man' is performed by Parker and Stone's band
DVDA (the meaning behind which will be explained within
the film.)
