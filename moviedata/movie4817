   Lake Tahoe is known to Americans as a vacation spot, a place
to escape from urban summer heat in the California Sierras--
fairly isolated but near enough to Reno's excitement.  There are,
however, people who live there the year-'round, folks who'd
make most of us envious for their proximity to the turquoise-clear
lake that gives the area its name but which, underneath the
shimmering surface, is frigid and uninviting.  In "The Deep End,"
Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton), a year-'round resident, is by
contrast chilly on the outside but  deep down, craves something
more than what she's getting.  She is lonely despite the presence
of an aging father-in-law and three fairly decent kids.  Her
husband is a naval officer who is not often home.  She's the type
of woman whose pallid features announce her submission as a
mom who is busy enough escorting her young daughter Paige
(Tamara Hope) to ballet class, driving her teen son Beau
(Jonathan Tucker) to trumpet practice, and keeping the little one,
Dylan (Jordan Dorrance) out of mischief.  The adventure that
changes this domestic scenario, a tragic chain of events that, I'd
imagine, she almost welcomes, supplies the noirish, if
melodramatic, texture of a film--one which garnered for lenser
Giles Nuttgens the Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance
Film Festival.
   Filmed mostly on location in Lake Tahoe, "The Deep End" is
both directed and written by Scott McGehee and David Siegel,
who updated the 1940's melodramatic novel of Elisabeth Sanxay
Holding fittingly to appeal to an audience in our less innocent
time.  Its chief merit is its repudiation of a Hollywood stereotype:
One of the villains is not a mean guy after all.  Though
handsome, George-Clooney-like Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic),
wants money, we see from the start that he's a guy with heart,
someone who both alerts Margaret to her forlorn condition and
even saves the life of her deadly-dull, annoying, live-in father-in-
law Jack Hall (Peter Donat).
   "The Deep End" opens with a visit by Margaret to a shady
friend of her teen son, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), with an urgent
request that the 30-year-old man--whom she rightly considers a
bad influence--stay away from the lad.  She's ignored, of course,
and when her son accidentally kills Darby, she covers for her boy
and is in turn blackmailed by Alek--who is under the thumb of a
senior blackmailer and really bad-guy villain, Carlie Nagle
(Raymond J. Barry).  As the film progresses at a lingering pace,
McGehee and Siegel gradually up the suspense ante,
juxtaposing what starts as a conventional murder-cum-blackmail
melo with an unusual romantic twist.  Aptly named "The Deep
End," the story is fixated with water--the slowly dripping faucet in
the Hall residence, the burial spot for a victim of accidental
murder, above all a metaphor for Margaret's existential condition
as a woman who is figuratively underwaterall the time.
   Tilda Swinton, astonishing in her role as a cross-gender, trans-
century woman in "Orlando," is more than proficient in a down-to-
earth capacity, having an adventure in a single area during a
period of just a few days--a woman whose iciness is slowly
chipping under the influence of a dashing bandit.  Though
Scottish and sporting a British accent, she integrates herself well
into an all-American community and makes the entire story not
only exceptionally watchable but believably suspenseful.

You know when you get one of your car tires stuck in the snow (or the mud,
for those of you who don't live north of the Mason-Dixon Line) and the
harder you work at freeing yourself, the deeper you sink?  That's the basic
premise of The Deep End, a stellar new film from Scott McGehee and David
Siegel, the duo who made the impressive, Hitchcockian Suture on a very tiny
budget a few years ago.
Tilda Swinton (The Beach) plays Margaret Hall, and although she isn't
literally spinning her tires, they're figuratively kicking up all kinds of
debris.  Margaret lives in a beautiful home on Lake Tahoe with her husband,
three children and father-in-law Jack (played by Peter Donat, Mulder's
father from The X-Files).  Her husband, a military officer, is never around
(we don't ever see him), leaving Margaret to contend with his distant father
and the insanity of carting the kids around to all manner of extracurricular
activities.
Margaret's trouble begins before the film even starts.  It seems that her
oldest son, Beau (Jonathan Tucker, The Virgin Suicides), was recently
involved in a fender-bender that involved both alcohol and a 30-something
man she tracks down, in End's first scene, to a gay nightclub in Reno called
The Deep End.  "I'm looking for Darby Reese," she says in a no-nonsense
manner reminiscent of a slightly less confident version of Terence Stamp's
Wilson from The Limey.
Darby (Josh Lucas, American Psycho) is offered $5,000 to stay away from
Beau, and considers it because he's the kind of Reno lowlife who owes money
to a bookie.  But he shows up at the Hall house later that night,
confronting Beau in what leads to a shoving match.  Unbeknownst to Beau,
Darby accidentally slips off the pier and catches the business end of an
anchor in his chest.
Margaret finds the body washed up on the shore the next morning and,
assuming her son did it, lets the protect-at-any-cost maternal instinct kick
in as she disposes of Darby a la Harvey Keitel's Winston "The Cleaner" Wolf
in Pulp Fiction.  Beau is a kid with a bright future (he has scholarship
offers thanks to his trumpet skills) and Margaret doesn't want murder
charges hanging over his teenage head.
But then the tire-spinning starts, and Margaret keeps getting deeper and
deeper into what she thinks is a murder cover-up, eventually culminating in
a blackmail attempt from a man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic, ER) He has
proof of Beau's relationship with Darby and is prepared to take it to the
cops unless he gets $50,000 within 24 hours.  And Alek doesn't so much care
that Margaret has to deal with the dance recitals, car pools and the "Mom,
where's my baseball glove?" stuff that goes along with being a mother.
The house on the lake is chock full of secrets, and that's one of the things
that makes this story work so well (it's based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's
1947 novel called The Blank Wall, which was made into The Reckless Moment in
1949).  Margaret never questions her son about Darby's death, or his sexual
history, and Beau keeps mum even though he's sure she's having an affair
with that mysterious guy who keeps showing up and getting her flustered.
Even Jack seems to be hiding something from the rest of his family, although
we never really find out what it is.
McGehee and Siegel, who produced, directed and adapted End's story from
Holding's novel, use color here like they've been working with it for
decades (Suture was in black and white).  Along with cinematographer Giles
Nuttgens (Battlefield Earth), who won the top prize at Sundance for his work
here, the directors use many cool shades of blue throughout the film, which
helps to make it look like Margaret is living her life underwater.  We see
water throughout the film (a dripping tap, fish tank, car wash, swimming
pool, water cooler and, of course, the lake) but good old H2O has
practically soaked into Margaret's life, right down to her husband being in
the Navy, and Beau being a member of the water polo team.
Even if you think End loses its way toward the denouement, there's no
denying Swinton's wonderful performance.  It's one of the best you'll see
this year, and she should clear her calendar for Oscar night.  Visnjic and
Tucker do well in their smaller roles, but this is Swinton's show, and she
takes full advantage of it in a way that you won't easily forget.
1:39 - R for some violence and language, and for a strong sex scene

When 17 year old Beau Hall (Jonathan Tucker, "The Virgin Suicides")
gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion, 
club owner Darby Reese (Josh Lucas, "Session 9"), his mom, Margaret 
(Tilda Swinton, "The War Zone") pays Reese a visit to convince him to
leave her son alone.  Instead, Reese travels out to their Lake Tahoe
home and lures Beau out to the boat house where Beau learns that his 
mother was right about Reese.  The next morning Margaret discovers
Darby's dead body on their beach and, suspecting the worst, weights it
down in a distant part of the lake.  But her troubles are just beginning,
as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer Alek Spera (Goran
Visnjic, "Practical Magic") in "The Deep End."
The incredibly pale, red-headed Scottish actress Swinton immerses herself
into the role of the reserved American super-mom whose life revolves
around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law
Jack (Peter Donat, "The Game").  She shows great strength while allowing
other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging Reese in
his gay disco (named The Deep End), near panic at having to dive down to his
body to retrieve car keys, or even wry humor when an attempt to get help
from Jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated.  Gradually her loneliness
becomes apparent (her husband's a naval officer, usually away at sea)
when her attempts to email him her concerns about Beau are deleted and
later, when a most unusual, yet chaste, romance turns tragic.  It's a 
terrific performance.
The Stendahl Syndrome-like script, adapted from Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's 
40's noir novel 'The Blank Wall' by directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel,
would be unbelievable if not for Swinton and her costar Visnjic.
Alek Spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after Reese's
body has been discovered.  He shows Margaret a videotape of Beau having
sex with Reese and demands $50,000 or he'll turn the tape over to the Reno
police.  Subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards,
though, as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail.
There's yet another problem, though - his partner Nagle (Raymond Barry, "Dead
Man Walking") is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of
the money is delivered.
Visnjic's dark, brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us
believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment.  His turnaround is
palpable as he witnesses Margaret's inherent decency and her workaday
surroundings.  Also outstanding is Tucker as Beau, who has a terrific character
arc and pas de deux with his mother.  Initially Beau's the typical sullen
teen.  'You're blowing this out of proportion,' he says of her concerns 
about Reese, not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have 
divined the true nature of the relationship.  As his mom gets in deeper and
deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn't commit, Beau becomes suspicious
of her actions and apparent new companion, turning tables.  His early black 
eye becomes her later split lip.  While the two can never be completely honest 
with each other, their love for each other comes through strongly.  
The directors ("Suture") have a firm grip on their material and cast.  The 
story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler 
underpinnings.  Water imagery is constant (an early shot of weirdly rushing 
green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium).  Giles Nuttgens 
("Fire") cinematography, which won the 2001 Sundance Festival award, is crisp 
and startlingly clear.  The Tahoe locations and production design by Kelly
McGehee and Christopher Tandon provide a dual personality for the film,
contrasting the calm, well off existence of the lake against the gambling
city of Reno.
"The Deep End" is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships.
Take the plunge.

"The Deep End" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a 
vast array of blues. Alluring, attractive blues, but also icy and 
foreboding. After taking in their beauty, the eye seeks out the 
reassuring browns and greens, like a tired swimmer searching for the 
safety of land. The production works that way as well Â it pulls you in 
initially as a crisp, thoroughly-modern thriller, with clipped exchanges 
between defiantly non-communicative characters. But the real draw of the 
film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "The Deep End" 
gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy 
coating. 
SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals the basic storyline. I believe the 
plot points are incidental, because the real rewards come in exploring 
the mindset of the main characters, but still, you should proceed at 
your own risk. 
With her husband Tom, a Naval officer, often away at sea, Margaret Hall 
(Tilda Swinton) holds down the fort, taking care of the children, Beau 
(Jonathan Tucker), Paige (Tamara Hope), and Dylan (Jordon Dorrance), 
while her father-in-law Jack (Peter Donat) hovers in the background, 
always watching. The story opens with Margaret leaving the family home 
in Lake Tahoe to storm a male strip club in Reno. It seems that Beau, 
her eldest, is having an affair with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), a 
disreputable sort 12 years his senior. Margaret demands that Darby leave 
her son alone, only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be 
glad to steer clear of Beau Â for $5000. 
Back at home, she tries to talk about it all with her son, but the kid 
won't even confirm that he's gay, let alone discuss the issues she has 
with his boyfriend. He does, however, get attentive when she reveals 
Darby's $5,000 offer, even as he maintains his sullen demeanor. Late in 
the evening, Darby shows up outside, tossing pebbles at Beau's window 
like a schoolchild. The two meet by the water at the boathouse, where 
something important happens. I won't reveal what; suffice to say we 
become aware of a significant fact that Margaret does not. 
All of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie, by the way. 
Within a day or so, Margaret's life becomes even more complicated when a 
suave man named Alec Goran Visnjic) turns up with an explicit videotape 
documenting the sex life of Beau and Darby. He and his associate are 
willing to destroy the tape, once Margaret coughs up $50,000. 
Written, directed and produced by Scott McGehee and David Siegel 
("Suture"), "The Deep End" is based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's 1940's 
novel, "The Blank Wall," which was also the source of the 1949 film, 
"The Reckless Moment." I've neither read the book nor seen the movie, 
but I understand that the filmmakers changed some details. In Holding's 
story, the "scandalous" relationship is between an older man and 
Margaret's teen-age daughter. Switching the gender makes the tale seem 
more contemporary, and it also raises questions about Margaret's 
motives. 
Many reviews of "The Deep End" describe Margaret as a mother ferociously 
protecting her son, but I wonder. Consider this: Margaret lives in a 
meticulously kept upscale home. Her husband is absent most of the time 
and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure. Her father-in-law 
is constantly present, almost as if he is monitoring for his son. And 
when her husband does call, Margaret is careful not to tell him about 
anything disturbing that is going on with the family. 
So is Margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is 
simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take 
advantage of him? Or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class 
complacency, desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything 
will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea? You sort 
it out. 
Regardless, the resonance of "The Deep End" comes from two actors. Goran 
Visnjic, best known from the TV drama "ER," is striking as a blackmailer 
unlike any you've seen before. He engages Margaret in a mesmerizing 
dance of protocol, chivalry and simmering eroticism. But the star of 
this show, without a doubt, is the remarkable Tilda Swinton. Watch the 
shadings, depth, resource, vitality and understated sexuality she gives 
Margaret and try to imagine the film without her. Days after my second 
viewing of "The Deep End," I can still vividly picture her negotiating 
with villains, trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue 
water. "The Deep End" is an exceptional film and Tilda Swinton is the 
best part of it.

Starring Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan
Tucker, Peter Donat. Directed by Scott McGehee and
David Siegel. Rated R.
The Deep End is one of the noblest failures that I've
had the mixed pleasure of seeing this year. The
well-reviewed suspense drama has the best of
intentions but it doesn't follow through. Its slow,
somber tone works but its story is a pretentious flop.
The filmmakers were so eager to make a story about a
woman's maternal instincts taken to the nth power that
they forgot to make the circumstances surrounding the
protagonist even remotely plausible.
The film opens with a knock on the door, and the sight
of Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) entering what seems
to be some sort of gay club and telling a guy to stay
away from her son or else. She has reason to be
worried. Beau (Jonathan Tucker), withdrawn, reserved,
and closeted, has formed an unhealthy relationship
with much-older Darby (Josh Lucas). Darby offers to
keep away, for a healthy sum of $5,000.
The next morning, after a confusing and potentially
incriminating series of events, Margaret finds Darby's
body lying by her dock. She assumes, not unreasonably,
that Beau is in some way responsible, or at the very
least that he will be a potential suspect in the
impending investigation. So she does what any sensible
mother would do: load the body into the motorboat and
dump it in the middle of Lake Tahoe.
Wait, no, that's emphatically not what a sensible
mother would do, but I'm willing to forgive the
logical misstep because if she didn't dump the body,
there would be no movie. But then things get really
strange. Margaret is approached by Alek (Goran
Visnjic), a strange man with a video tape of Beau
having sex with Darby. He demands fifty thousand
dollars to keep the tape out of the police's grubby
little hands. She says she has no way to get the
money. He says he doesn't care.
What I always find strange in movies like this is why
the blackmailee never calls the blackmailer's bluff. I
recall Ron Howard's underrated Ransom, which turned
this convention on its head. If Alek and his partner
in crime hand the tape over, the whole endeavor has
been worthless and they walk away empty-handed. I've
always thought this to be an unlikely scenario under
any circumstances. If Margaret hands over the money,
she may see the tape destroyed, but who says they
don't have other copies and who says they won't come
after her again?
Never mind. I can forgive this as well. The Deep End
nails shut its own coffin with a ludicrous plot twist
in which Alek evidently gets cold feet and
inexplicably sympathizes with Margaret. In the climax,
the protagonist is reduced to being a helpless
bystander while two guys duke it out. You'd think
she'd be elemental in the conflict's resolution, but
the movie makes her a waif.
Shame, because The Deep End's mood is on target. It
has the courage to develop slowly and, right up until
the end, it's careful not to betray its character. The
flip side, of course, is that in a movie this serious
we have to buy the story and, unfortunately, I didn't.
Perhaps the film would have been better off had it not
tried to weave a Hitchcockian plot tapestry and simply
focused on the woman trying to dig her son out of a
hole. It's not pleasant to watch a movie that works so
hard to pull the rug out from under itself.

        With three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care
for--cooking and cleaning and laundry, drop-offs at Little League practice
and pick-ups from ballet practice--Margaret Hall's life is rife with
complications.  And with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in
the North Atlantic, virtually impossible to reach by telephone, Margaret
leads the crazed life of a single parent.  But Margaret's hectic world is
about to get a lot more complicated.  Her teenage son Beau, a talented
trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into Wesleyan
University's music program, has fallen in with the wrong crowd.  His mother
drives from their idyllic, lakeside community of Tahoe City, California to
the sprawling urban metropolis of Reno, Nevada, with its imposing concrete
superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs, to confront the 30-something
man who has befriended Beau.  "Stay away from my son" Margaret warns Darby
Reese.  Her words, however, appear to fall on deaf ears as Reese turns up
drunk at the family homestead later that evening, urging Beau to join him
in the boathouse.  There are words and advances and some pushing and
shoving and Beau runs back into the house, passed his startled mother, as
the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and
an intoxicated Reese tumbles out of sight.  The next day, on her morning
walk, Margaret discovers Reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the
shoreline, a boat anchor impaled in his chest.  With her maternal instincts
working overtime, Margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake,
weighs it down, and dumps it overboard.  But Margaret's life is about to
get a lot more complicated.  Soon after the body is discovered, snagged on
a local fisherman's line, Margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming
blackmailer in a red Nova.  Alek Spera threatens to hand over compromising
videotape of Beau to the police unless Margaret comes up with $50,000 by 4
o'clock the next day.  But Margaret's life is about to get a lot more
complicated, for Alek turns out to be something she never expected.
        Based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's novel "The Blank Wall," "The Deep End"
is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by Scott McGehee and David
Siegel ("Suture").  It makes the most of a talented but not particularly
well-known cast--Goran Visnjic plays Alek with a suave likeability,
Jonathan Tucker shines as the conflicted Beau, Peter Donat is amusing as
grandfather Hall, and Josh Lucas has an equally small but effective role as
the hapless Darby Reese.  The film is also lovingly photographed by Giles
Nuttgens and features an evocative score, courtesy Peter Nashel.  But it
owes everything to British actress Tilda Swinton.  Swinton, whose
pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of Derek Jarman's films
("Caravaggio," "Edward II," "The Last of England"), plays Margaret Hall in
"The Deep End" and, like Charlotte Rampling in this year's "Under the
Sand," turns in a commanding and accomplished performance.  Margaret is a
devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she
loves, and Swinton captures every frustration, every fear, every subtle
examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of
her being.  The role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the
least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of
domestic responsibilities.  Many can relate to that, of course; it's the
murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that
Swinton so gracefully, so graciously, makes resonate with the truest of
colors.  The end is deep all right, and there isn't a single shallow moment
in Tilda Swinton's canon.

I was stunned after seeing "The Deep End." Here is a film noir story with the
machinations of the thriller genre but all wrapped in ivory silk, as if any and
all cliches that could occur are withheld in the service of melancholia. This is
noir that is not really bleak and a thriller that looks for behavioral
characteristics to thrill us, all told with an absorbing sense of serenity that
distinguishes it from most other thrillers. 
The film begins with a jeep arriving at some undisclosed nightclub in Reno. A
tall, lanky, red-headed woman warns a sleazy guy to stay away from her son. We
are unaware of what the situation is but we know he represents sleaze and we
know she is a worrisome mother. It turns out the mother's son, Beau (Jonathan
Tucker), is having a homosexual affair with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), the sleazy
guy at the nightclub who owes a huge gambling debt. Beau's mother, Margaret
(Tilda Swinton), wants him to stay away from Darby since all he represents is
trouble. When Darby makes an unscheduled visit at their house in Lake Tahoe,
Beau pleads with him to keep away. Darby will keep if Margaret pays him $5,000.
A fight ensues resulting in the accidental death of Darby. The next day,
Margaret finds the body and thus, the film's moral center takes over in an
unusual, lyrical manner. 
I will not say much more except that this serenely modest thriller is different
from most Hitchcock thrillers in that usually the protagonist and the audience
is aware of information that no one else is aware of. In this case, we know the
truth behind the accidental death of Darby that no one else in the movie knows.
Not even the seedy man from Reno ("E.R.'s" Goran Visnjic) who demands money to
keep his mouth shut from what might be a potential murder. And Margaret does her
best to keep calm and hide Darby's body. She wants to protect her son, her
father-in-law, and her other son and daughter from the evils of the world,
notably Reno. 
Tilda Swinton is clearly the star of "The Deep End," imbuing the screen with a
vitality and strength that is breathtaking to witness. I have only seen her in
one other film, the magnificent "Orlando," but her performance here makes me
want to pursue her earlier work. Perhaps even more so than Cate Blanchett,
Swinton has a sense of authority as the doting, respectful mother that dominates
the screen. It is no accident that the number of closeups in the film enhance
her strong, magnetic presence. Interestingly, Swinton's Margaret seems to barely
take notice of her children except for Beau - it is a family life where the
father-in-law is more concerned about her than anyone else (including her unseen
husband who is a Navy officer). 
"The Deep End" is directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel III, who previously
collaborated on "Suture." They have an uncanny eye for detail and savor
appropriately breathless cinematic moments that never disrupt the pace or
momentum. I found the shot of Swinton underwater while looking for car keys from
Darby's body positively thrilling and unnerving to watch. Also look closely at
framed shots of Swinton, usually seen from windows or from other obstructions
(one extreme example is a fish-eyed lens shot reflected in a drop of water).
Water and glass are prominently featured whenever Swinton's Margaret appears on
screen and it nicely balances with the Lake Tahoe setting - prominent yet
unassuming. 
"The Deep End" is occasionally melodramatic towards the end and climaxes sooner
than it should have. Still,  a magnificent central performance by Swinton, not
to mention an understated cast and a hauntingly lyrical tone that switches from
engaging thriller to a heart-rending love story, more than makes up for it.

DEEP END, THE (director/writer: David Siegel & Scott McGehee; screenwriter:
based on Elizabeth Sanxay Holding's novel "The Blank Wall"; cinematographer:
Giles 
Nuttgens; editor: Lauren Zuckerman; cast: Tilda Swinton (Margaret Hall), Goran
Visnjic (Alek Spera), Jonathan Tucker (Beau Hall), Peter Donat (Jack Hall), Josh

If you've seen Max OphÃ¼ls' Reckless Moment (49), you've seen this film. It's the
same story but updated to fit modern times. My take on remakes is--if it was a
great film, as the 1940s noir film was, why make another! But, at least, this
version is as good. Yet it has nothing new to add; what this colorized version
does differently to suit modern times is have 'supermom,' the outstanding
British actress Tilda Swinton, be concerned with saving her family's reputation
and holding it together after being blackmailed because of her teenage son's
secret gay fling with a 30-year-old sleaze, who owns a gay bar in Reno called
The Deep End. In the older version, it was the teenage girl having an affair
with a sleazy older guy in LA that concerned Joan Bennett. Both matriarchs give
Oscar quality performances, in a film that is based on the novel by Elizabeth
Sanxay Holding called "The Blank Wall" and directed by the team who did
Suture--David Siegel & Scott McGehee. 
Margaret Hall (Swinton) is all-family, her Navy officer hubby is all-Navy, as he
distances himself from family affairs by being almost unreachable in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean on a carrier while she tries to ply her musically inclined
Lake Tahoe spoiled rotten son to enrol in a good college back east and stay away
from a parasitic Reno sybaritic bar owner who exudes sex, larceny and sleaze,
Darby Reese (Josh Lucas). 
Darby is tempted by Maggie's offer of $5,000 to split from Beau, but when the
lascivious Darby comes sneaking in on his younger lover's house late at night
they get into a little tiff 
down by the waterfront area and Darby is accidently killed. The spoiled young
man doesn't even realize what he's done, but mom cleans up the mess early in the
AM by dumping his body, with an anchor stuck in it, out in the lake. 
The blackmail comes into play when Alek Spera (Visnjic), in the James Mason
role, of the young career hood who falls for Swinton's motherhood and can't go
through with the callous scheme with his ruthless partner Nagel of getting
$50,000 from her to prevent him from going to the police with a sex videotape of
her son and Darby humping their tails off--which will likely implicate him in
the murder. 
Mom proves she will do anything for her family, as she frantically tries to
raise the money she doesn't have. Despite the crisis she doesn't miss a beat
taking care of the family who are always around her-- she takes care of her
heart attack victim elderly father-in-law (Donat), attends her ballet dancing
daughter Paige's school performance and nurtures her youngest son Dylan, while
also doing anything possible to protect Beau from misfortune--plus doing all the
housework. This perfect mom moves Alek greatly, enough so he will give up his
life for some respect from the middle-class icon of family values. It didn't
convince me in the older version, nor does it in the newer; but Swinton as the
perfect mom is convincing, as we see the determination and pain in her face as
it is drawn tight in gaunt looks out at the world that has turned hostile for
her. This suburban soccer mom and SUV-driver is taking on the representatives of
the world she has escaped from--the city world of lowbrow crime figures, and
she's willing to go to the mat for her unaware son and family. It's a moving but
restraint performance and gives the art-house thriller some depth.

THE DEEP END, stunningly written, directed and produced by Scott McGehee and
David Siegel, involves a murder cover-up and an associated blackmail scheme.  In
a performance that one hopes will receive an Academy Award nomination, Tilda
Swinton plays Margaret Hall, an exasperated mother trying her best to save her
son, who has gotten himself into trouble again.  She demonstrates a palpable
fear as she begins to do the unthinkable in order to shield her son from the
police by covering up a murder.  
In this realistic story, life in the town doesn't come to a standstill, and
Margaret has the constant domestic responsibilities of caring for all three of
her children.  The birds still chirp and life goes on as she finds herself
pushing way beyond any limits that she had ever her dreamed of.  Her breathing
becomes labored and her face flushed, but she, most of all, must keep up the
appearance of normalcy.
We learn in a flashback that her oldest child, Beau (Jonathan Tucker), was
recently injured in a car accident.  Alcohol was involved, as was Beau's
questionable new friend, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas).  With Darby's little
mustache, he looks like a classic villain.  He also gets the story's best line,
when he tells Beau that his mother knows what's going on between them.  "She's a
mother, not a moron," he tells him.
Beau is a good kid with a bright future.  He'll be on his way to college
shortly, but only if his mother is successful in shielding him from being
arrested for murder.
To complicate the mother's woes, Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic) shows up on her
doorstep demanding $50,000, or he will turn over a key piece of evidence to the
police.  He turns out not to be at all what you'd expect in a blackmailer.  The
entire story is told with quietness and subtlety, and his reserved but
persistent character fits right in.  
The press notes mention that Alfred Hitchcock chose Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's
novel, "The Blank Wall," upon which the script is based, for his classic
anthology, "My Favorites in Suspense."  It is easy to see why Hitchcock was
attracted to this tale.  The best part of the story is that early on the
audience learns a key to the mystery of which neither the son nor the mother is
aware.  And the son and the mother, who love each other but don't communicate
well -- sound familiar? -- also have a completely different understanding of the
basic facts of the case.
Set in a remote Tahoe house and filmed in cool blues and warm earth tones, the
picture has an intriguing and inviting look.  We stay glued to the screen,
wanting to shout out suggestions to the characters and feeling like crying about
the tragedy in which they have found themselves engulfed.  It is filled with
easy characters to empathize with.  
As we see the time is winding down for the conclusion, we remain at a loss to
figure out how this story can ever be wrapped up.  What you will remember most
after the movie is over is Tilda Swinton's amazing performance.  One hopes that
the members of the Academy will also remember it when it comes time to vote.
THE DEEP END runs 1:39.  It is rated R for "some violence and language, and for
a strong sex scene" and would be acceptable for older teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Wednesday, August 15, 2001. 
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.

For any thriller to work fully there are two real requirements. 
The viewer has to have some emotional investment in the 
characters, particularly the main character, and the characters 
have to make choices that will affect the outcome of the story. 
If we do not care what happens to the main character we might as 
well be watching pieces on a chessboard.  If the people in the 
story do not make judgments and choices then they might as well be 
on a thrill ride at an amusement park following its inevitable 
track.  They just ride through the various dangers they face.  In 
THE DEEP END we are given reason to empathize with Margaret Hall 
(played by Tilda Swinton), but after the first half-hour or so she 
is mostly doing just what she has to do.  While other characters 
are complex and at times do the unexpected, once we know Margaret 
well enough to care for her, we also know the choices that she 
will make.  And by never doing anything unexpected she loses much 
of her interest value.  The film is almost a morality tale. 
Having made a bad choice at the beginning, this long chain of 
events is what she has earned for herself. 
Margaret Hall lives with her family in an idyllic existence in a 
nice house on Lake Tahoe.  Her son Beau (Jonathan Tucker) is a 
promising music student making applications to various colleges. 
Margaret's one wish is to protect Beau from the clutches of a male 
lover whom she is sure just wants to use her son.  After a 
clandestine assignation between the two Margaret finds the lover 
dead.  Without telling anyone she decides to hide the body so her 
son will not be implicated in the investigation.  This leaves her 
prey to blackmail and a horrific chain of events. 
Swinton is known mostly for roles of women who have foregone 
anything like a "normal" lifestyle.  Somehow her unusual, almost 
albino, looks lead to unusual roles.  In ORLANDO she plays her 
best known role, an immortal who at one point for no obvious 
reason spontaneously changes gender from male to female. 
Frequently she plays women of power.  It is a little odd seeing 
her play a housewife who at least starts out somewhat typical.  Of 
course not long into the movie she is juggling her life as a 
housewife with her secret life dealing with blackmailers.  The man 
who has contacted her for hush money also shows sides to his 
personality we would not expect. 
This is the second screen adaptation of the 1947 novel THE BLANK 
WALL by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding.  The first was the 1949 film THE 
RECKLESS MOMENT with James Mason and Joan Bennett directed by Max 
Ophuls.  Ophuls chose to use actors who would be familiar to 
audiences, hence making it a glossier production.  The team of 
Scott McGehee and David Siegal who have been writing and directing 
thrillers since 1993's SUTURE.  Here again they wrote and 
directed.  They chose to use generally less familiar actors than 
the previous version.  Only Swinton and character actor Peter 
Donat were even vaguely familiar to me. 
THE DEEP END is a well-acted story of a woman who makes one 
mistake and then faces some fairly harrowing consequences.  I rate 
it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Welcome to beautiful Lake Tahoe, where a boy can still get his mom to
cover up a murder and be home in time for supper.
A heavy drama, The Deep End is just such a tale.  When teenaged Beau
(Jonathan Tucker) gets mixed up with a seedy, older man (he's secretly
gay), their relationship gets a bit too intense and the lech ends up
dead.  Imagine her surprise when mom Margaret (Tilda Swinton) stumbles
upon a corpse on her idyllic beach!  Of course, she does what any mother
of an aspiring musical virtuoso would do -- sinks the body in the lake,
hides the guy's car, and pretends nothing has happened.
Before long, the body is discovered, and the film takes a turn toward a
blackmail plot, courtesy of ER nice guy Goran Visnjic.  Ultimately this
is a film about desperate measures -- a test of how far maternal
instinct can take a person.  Too bad the execution of that concept isn't
as assured.
It's a movie you never saw (and you were lucky), but Before and After
went down this road (unmemorably, I should add) a few years ago, only
there it was the father willing to cover up the crime.  That was a movie
with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, and even they couldn't pull this plot
off, getting oh-so-serious with the moral dilemma and forgetting that
there were people looking to the screen for entertainment.
The Deep End learns nothing from that lesson.  Moving slowly and
deliberately, the film finally comes to a boil after about 90 minutes,
but I fear much of the audience will be lost by then.  Instead of trying
to surprise or dazzle us, the film plays coy, throwing one perplexing
plot twist after another such that we are left with surprisingly little
explanation for anything we've seen along the way.
It's all vaguely unsatisfying because it's just never believable.  For
starters, we don't believe that Margaret or her son would never be
caught -- or even suspected -- for the crime.  And when Margaret finally
and tearfully tells us what really happened that night, we don't believe
it then, either.  The truth, as she tells it, doesn't even seem
possible.  Combined with the worst fake-trumpet-playing footage put to
film, the whole affair just comes off as phony, a gimmick that might
have worked on serialized radio in the 1930's but not on the big screen
today (oddly enough, the film is based on an old serialized novel called
The Blank Wall).
Fortunately, The Deep End is a lovely film to look at, well photographed
and populated with universally interesting, nuanced, and surprisingly
rich characters.  That only takes you so far, of course; it's also worth
noting that the sound design and film editing are amateurishly bad.
As its centerpiece, Swinton owns the film as she so often does, her very
spare facial features a mask upon which every emotion under the sun is
projected.  Would that those emotions made a little more sense in the
context of the plot.

     Kids have no idea who their parents are or what they go through.  Parents
are a natural resource, like air or television, indispensable but hardly worth
much thought.  In the taut new thriller `The Deep End', the great Scottish
actress Tilda Swinton (`Orlando') plays Margaret Hall, a Lake Tahoe mom who
juggles laundry, shopping, fixing meals, driving the kids to practice, and
covering up an apparent murder with such nervy aplomb that none of her three
kids tumbles that there's anything unusual going on..  But as the deceased-to-be
points out to her oldest, `She's a mother, not a moron.'
     Writer-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel (`Suture') have taken
Elizabeth Sanxay Holding's Â40s novel The Blank Wall (previously filmed in '49
by Max Ophuls as `The Reckless Moment') and updated it, introducing a homosexual
element for contemporary relevance into what is essentially an old-fashioned
woman's melodrama in the Joan Crawford/Barbara Stanwyck tradition.  17-year-old
Beau (Jonathan Tucker) has fallen into a relationship with Darby (Josh Lucas), a
decadently charming thirty-ish sleazebag who is leading him into corrupt ways. 
As the movie opens, Beau has already been an auto accident with Darby, and
Margaret, who disapproves of the relationship without being absolutely certain
of its nature and extent, beards the creep in his lair, a shady club called The
Deep End, and tells him to stay away from her boy.  
     The plot thickens when Darby turns up dead in the shallows by the Halls'
boathouse. Mothers like to think the best of their kids, but they suspect the
worst. Margaret jumps to the conclusion that Beau has done to Darby what she
would like to have done to him. She disposes of the body and the deceased's car
without even asking any questions, and by the time she does get a better picture
of what might actually have happened, she is well down a road that permits no
backing up.  Then the plot thickens some more, adding blackmail and betrayal and
even an off-beat sort of romance to its darkening brew.
     `The Deep End' is awash in water imagery, great (the adjacent Lake Tahoe),
greater (Margaret's absent husband is a naval officer off at sea), small (a
fishtank), and smaller (a room refracted through a drop swelling from a faucet),
and it sometimes goes a little overboard.  Cinematographer Giles Nuttgens shoots
the movie elegantly with a cool palette of underwater washes, punctuated with
strong color only in the bright reds of Margaret's coat and the blackmailer's
car, but once or twice jarring daylight seeps in from outdoors during a night
scene.  There is something a shade improbable in the character of the
blackmailer with a heart of gold (a moodily charismatic and outrageously
handsome Goran Visnjic of `E.R.'), and a climactic scene between him and
Margaret loses its footing on the slippery slope of melodrama.  But none of the
occasional missteps derail the mounting tension.  As the plot swirls along, the
filmmakers keep flinging setbacks at Margaret's feet like marbles, but she
dodges them doggedly and keeps on coming.
     McGehee and Siegel keep turning the screws and ratcheting up the suspense,
but they know as well as we do that none of it would be worth a tinker's dam
were it not for the Oscar-caliber performance of Tilda Swinton, who conveys
ordinariness stretched to the breaking point.  Swinton is one of the best
actresses practically nobody has ever seen, and here she grabs hold of us from
the first moment with her sharp, pale face erased of anything but fierce,
nervous resolve.  Peter Donat (seen here on stage last month in The Cherry
Orchard) is good as the doddering father-in-law, and Raymond Barry provides
muscular badness as the blackmailer's partner.  Tucker adds a gutsy low-keyed
portrayal of the troubled teenage son that avoids the pitfalls of exaggeration,
and he and Swinton create a moving chemistry from the moment when the son
finally awakens to the possibility that his mother may actually have a life and
a few secrets of her own.
