"Mockumentaries" are an under-appreciated genre of film. I'd imagine making 
one would be more difficult than making a regular comedy because you have to 
convey an atmosphere of reality while being satirical and sometimes all-out 
hysterical. That said I'd like to go on record as saying "Best In Show" will 
be the most over-looked film this year. It's one of the smartest comedies 
I've seen in years. 
Last year a mockumentary called "Drop Dead Gorgeous" did a good job in 
zinging the beauty pageant industry. That film had some pretty big names to 
it but didn't do as well as expected at the box office.  That film took a 
biting look at how serious some people get over such a relatively superficial 
event. With "Best In Show," co-writer and director Christopher Guest realizes 
human vanity is an easy target to parody and he succeeds by taking human 
vanity a step further to the point where vanity becomes a lifestyle. No, it's 
not about rich snobs (although the film does spoof them too), it's about 
people who are active participants in the dog show circuit. To them their pet 
is not really a companion but a ticket to fame and fortune and the lengths 
they'll go through for that is unbelievably funny. 
The film is an ensemble of about 20 main characters who are all realistic 
people but have their own quirkiness. I hesitate to list the "stars" since 
most of the characters are given equal screen time and contribute to the 
comedy in their own way. 
We start by meeting many different people from around the country who are 
about to travel to Philadelphia for the supposedly world-renowned Mayflower 
Dog Show. They all have different breeds of dogs and treat them in a 
different way. Some practically worship their canine, others order them 
around like a parent would to a small child. Some pamper their pooches like 
babies and some treat them like equals. What they all have in common is a 
desire to win the Best In Show award because they have truly dedicated a 
piece of themselves to their dogs and would like to think it's something more 
then just an owner-master relationship. 
Of course the humans' personalities play an integral role in making the film 
the delight it is. To really do the movie justice I should go over ALL of 
them individually, but instead I'll just give a few good examples. 
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play a Florida couple who seem to be 
experienced in the dog show industry. Levy's character Gerry is a dorky wuss 
married to a buxom blonde named Cookie who, shall we say, "has a reputation." 
Levy is excellent in this role because you don't know if he's clueless or too 
shrewd to do anything every time his wife meets another man who seems to know 
her from somewhere. There's one particular scene where the two stop at a 
couple's house and the husband (played perfectly by Larry Miller) is all over 
Cookie in front of both his wife and Gerry. 
Another strange couple is Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael 
Hitchcock) who are so obsessed with their dog and perfection from it they 
actually visit a pet psychologist and discuss how their sex life effects 
their dog and their chances of winning at the show. Posey has some 
outstanding scenes where she flies off the handle when the slightest problem 
crops up.  What she does to anyone who gets in her is what exemplifies smart 
black comedy. 
Two other couples to mention are a stereotypical gay couple who are genuinely 
funny and not offensive, and a gold-digging bimbo and her ambiguous female 
friend who handles her award-winning poodle. There's also a southern man 
whose best friend is a purebred bloodhood. 
In writing these character descriptions just now I noticed I either used or 
wanted to used a term to describe how excellent the performances were. I have 
never seen such commitment to character in a comedy before. Since this is a 
mockumentary I would imagine many of the lines were ad-libed because they 
never come across as forced or cliche. If you listen closely you'll hear some 
fantastic lines and quick comments that add to the detail of the characters 
and their situations. They're like inside jokes that don't need any 
explanation. 
And that all comes back to the direction and production of the film. Guest's 
camera work keeps the atmosphere realistic with characters talking over other 
characters and constant activity in the background (again, listen for those 
subtle one-liners). There's a few scenes of people talking directly to the 
camera to voice their thoughts on things but Guest doesn't rely on this 
technique to fill in characteristics or plot points. In fact I'd criticize 
him for not using ENOUGH of these sequences. 
Special mention MUST be made to the contribution of Fred Willard as a TV 
commentator covering the dog show as if it were a major sporting event. 
Willard is the king of Hollywood's working actors in my mind. His presence 
alone automatically makes any scene or sketch funny because he's so deadpan 
in his approach. He comes up with comments that are usually silly but catch 
you off guard and you can't help but laugh. Here he's teamed with an Engl
ishman playing the role of the expert on dog shows who has terrific comic 
timing and chemistry with Willard. 
What makes "Best In Show" great is how smoothly it flows between the 
performances, the screenplay and the direction. Most comedies have funny 
jokes and average performances, but how many comedies can you name where the 
direction was one of the reasons it worked as well as it did?

     You have to believe that Christopher Guest is a smart enough guy to
realize he's setting himself up for some tough comparisons. The legendary
mock documentary THIS IS SPINAL TAP, co-starring and co-written by Guest,
is making a return appearance to theaters to remind viewers that it was
the funniest comedy of the 1980s; Guest also co-wrote and directed WAITING
FOR GUFFMAN, another very funny mock documentary. It's a format that's
been good for Guest, and you can't blame him for returning to the well,
especially when venturing outside it to direct has resulted in garbage
like the Chris Farley/Matthew Perry debacle ALMOST HEROES. But you have to
wonder when his luck will run out. How many mock documentaries can one
director fit on the head of a pin?
     BEST IN SHOW is a very entertaining film comedy on a pure laugh
meter, but it's missing something SPINAL TAP and GUFFMAN both had to
spare: a real perspective on its subject, and genuine affection for its
characters. The setting is the world of dog shows, specifically the
prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia. The
"documentary" follows several participants through their travels to and
preparation for the show. Gerry (Eugene Levy) and Cookie Fleck (Catherine
O'Hara) drive up from Florida with their Norwich terrier Winky; 
high-strung yuppie couple Hamilton (Michael Hitchcock) and Meg Swan 
(Parker Posey) bring their equally high-strung Weimeraner Beatrice; North
Carolina fishing supply store owner Harlan Pepper (Guest) comes with his
young bloodhound Hubert. And there's two-time defending champion Rhapsody
in White, a standard poodle owned by trophy wife Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer
Coolidge) and handled by veteran trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch).
     As has been the case in Guest's other mockumentaries, BEST IN SHOW
starts with some broadly comic characters to get the gags rolling. Gerry
does plenty of slow burns while man after man relates his sexual history
with Cookie. The braces-wearing Swans freak out over every bump in their
lives. There is also a gay couple (Michael McKean and John Michael 
Higgins) who raise Shih tzus, the latter of whom swishes about and
dispenses double-entendre about pepperoni. Lots of the dialogue -- much of
it obviously improvised -- is hilarious, especially when it involves
absurdities like Harlan's interest in ventriloquism or Gerry's (literal) 
two left feet. If you just sit back and listen, the laughs will keep
coming.
     The laughs should have been richer, however, and there's a reason
they're not. In SPINAL TAP and GUFFMAN, the broad characters were only the
starting point for people that eventually became much more human and
sympathetic as we come to understand their world. Guest never seems nearly
as interested in the complexities of his characters or their world in BEST
IN SHOW. There's no sense for why people become so obsessed with putting
their pets through the show-dog grind, no real affection for their quirks
or insecurities. In fact, he plays downright nasty with Sheri Ann and the
Swans in particular, making them fairly grotesque caricatures. There's a
sense that Guest has picked a milieu where he knew there would be a lot of
weird people, and decided simply to wring the laughs out of their
weirdness.
     There are plenty of laughs to be wrung out of that weirdness,
fortunately, and even more to be wrung from the show itself. BEST IN SHOW
gets a tremendous boost once Fred Willard shows up as the Mayflower show's
loud-mouthed announcer Buck Laughlin, whose inane questions for his
flustered British co-host provide nearly non-stop laughs. Laughlin is also
one of the few characters whose ridiculousness is accompanied by a wink; 
he's a guy doing a job he's utterly unqualified for, embarrassing himself
while trying to make the best of it. Willard is brilliant, and the rest of
BEST IN SHOW is still pretty funny. It's simply funny in a slightly more
mean-spirited way, making it harder to embrace unreservedly. Guest has
scored again, but this time there's a less welcome sort of "mock" in his
mock documentary.

    There's something about dog shows that's terribly
amusing. I know those who show off their purebreds take them very,
very seriously, but for onlookers, like Christopher Guest, the
possibilities for comedy are endless. In fact, sanity goes to the dogs
where Best of Breed trophies are concerned. This wacky mockumentary, a
worthy successor to "Waiting for Guffman," centers on Philadelphia's
annual Mayflower Dog Show, similar to New York's Westminster Dog Show.
Diverse contenders include, from Illinois, a bickering, neurotic
yuppie couple (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock) with Beatrice, their
depressed Weimaraner; from Florida, a milquetoast menswear salesman
(Eugene Levy) with, literally, two left feet and bubbly, his
promiscuous wife (Catherine O'Hara), showing Winky, their Norwich
Terrier; from North Carolina, a fly-fishing shop owner (Christopher
Guest) with his beloved Bloodhound Hubert; from New York, a
flamboyantly gay couple (John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean) with
Miss Agnes, one of their Shih Tzus; and from the Main Line, a trashy
trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired handler (Jane Lynch)
with their two-time champion Standard Poodle, Rhapsody in White. Plus
there's the show's President (Bob Balaban), chairman (Don Lake), and
mis-matched commentators (Jim Piddock, Fred Willard), along with a
long-suffering hotel manager (Ed Begley Jr.)  Guest and his
co-scripter Eugene Levy obviously encouraged their ensemble cast into
improvisational riffs that are executed with somewhat predictable but
barkingly loony, fast-paced finesse, particularly the one-liners and
non-sequiturs. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Best in Show"
is a dementedly funny 9. It's a hilarious howl - a walloping woof!

     Just when you thought the mockumentary had mocked everything worth
mocking, here comes a new gem of the genre that will have you rolling in
the aisles once again.
     Up for skewering this time around is the dog show, as Best in Show
takes the absolutely inane shenanigans of dog breeders and handlers,
impaling their obsession with a caliber of wit unseen since This is
Spinal Tap made rock gods look like buffoons.
     Not that this is a surprise.  Writer/director Christopher Guest
wrote and composed the music for Spinal Tap, directed the funny-hmmm
Waiting for Guffman, and even starred in the masterful and sarcastic The
Princess Bride.  His The Big Picture is one of the most underrated
parodies -- attacking Hollywood -- of all time.  Guest knows comedy, and
he is still at the top of his game.
     Best in Show owes its hilarity to its script, which gives us the
simple premise of pet owners from around the country converging on the
Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia (you know, where they make the cream
cheese).  And while the script is stellar, opening with a yuppie couple
in group psychotherapy with their depressed Weimaraner, it's the dead-on
casting that makes Best in Show so teary-eyed goofy.
     With some dozen characters, it's hard to single out any one actor
who steals the show, but I'd have to give top honors to John Michael
Higgins (the guy who played Letterman in The Late Shift), a screaming
queen with a Shih Tzu named Miss Agnes and a straightish "companion"
played by Michael McKean.  Parker Posey is always a treat to watch as
half of the yuppie couple; with their matching braces and testimonials
about being so fortunate to be raised "with catalogs," the Starbucks set
has never looked more embarrassing.
     Guest has a role as a hick Bloodhound-owner cum ventriloquist, and
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara give their best as pathetic,
lower-than-white trash Terrier wranglers.  (O'Hara's slutty vixen even
sticks her name tag right on her chest instead of her top.)  Finally
there's Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's Mom from American Pie) as a Philly
society gal, Anna Nicole Smith-like in her buxomness and adamancy that
her marriage to an octogenarian is filled with love.  Who will win the
silver cup?  Who cares?  They're all fall-down funny.
     What unfortunately drags Best in Show off its game is the fact that
most of these actors have been around the block a time or two in this
kind of material.  At least a half-dozen of the main players are Second
City or Spinal Tap comedy veterans, including Fred Willard's loutish
announcer, who wonders on the air why the Bloodhound can't put on a
Sherlock Holmes hat and a smoke a pipe.  There's just no opportunity to
mistake Best in Show for a real documentary -- as some did when Spinal
Tap came out, and as many still do with a movie like Dadetown.  While
the documentary style is intact, these faces are just too familiar to
pull that off.
     That and a few missed joke opportunities aside, Best in Show has
easily gained a spot on my top ten list this year.  Maybe not the blue
ribbon, but definitely the red.

Beatrice, lying sad and limp on her psychiatrist's couch, is emotionally 
devastated.  After walking into her parents bedroom and witnessing, 
well, you know, she hasn't been the same sense.  Her parents, Meg 
(Parker Posey) and Hamilton Swan (Michael Hitchcock), two type-A yuppie 
lawyers, are actually her owners -- not that they'd admit it -- since 
Beatrice is a dog.  Of the three, Beatrice is by far the sanest.
In an age in which comedies seem to come only in two flavors, mean and 
meaner (or crude and cruder), Christopher Guest's BEST IN SHOW is a 
delightful change of pace.  It's a good-spirited comedy that gets laughs 
the old-fashioned way with sweetness and charm.  Guest, whose specialty 
is mockumentaries, acted in THIS IS SPINAL TAP and acted in, directed 
and co-wrote WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, which he does again for BEST IN SHOW.
This fake documentary about the world of competitive dog shows is, of 
course, not really about the dogs but about their owners.  With a 
terrific ensemble cast, many of whom appeared in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, 
the story moves from one hilarious episode to another.  Although 
Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy are credited as the writers, the press 
notes say that most of the lines were purposely improvised, which adds 
to the mock authenticity.
Guest plays Harlan Pepper, a good olde boy from Pinenut, North Carolina, 
whose obsession with nut-naming used to drive his mother, well, nuts.  
His dog, Hubert, is a Bloodhound who bears a resemblance to his owner.  
Or is it the other way round?  Actually this is a trait common to most 
of the dogs and their owners in BEST IN SHOW.
Beatrice, a tall, thin Weimaraner, looks like her tall, lanky owners 
except that she doesn't have matching braces like they do.  Meg and 
Hamilton are clothes horses and catalog fanatics, whose favorite game is 
to take the latest L.L. Bean catalog and try to name all of the new 
items in less than five minutes.  As Meg puts it gushingly, "We are so 
lucky to have been raised among catalogs!"  
No one can play the hyperactive bitch role with more charm and grace 
than Posey, who may be best known for her role as Tom Hank's live-in 
girlfriend in YOU'VE GOT MAIL.  Her best performance, however, was 
probably her office rebel in CLOCKWATCHERS, a great black satire on 
cubicle life.
A wealthy, non-talking octogenarian named Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick 
Cranshaw) and his cheesy, younger wife, Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), 
are proud owners of the two-time Best in Show champion, Rhapsody in 
White, a Standard Poodle with an outlandish haircut.  Sherri Ann, with 
her bee-stung lips and jumbo-sized breasts, brags about all of things 
that she and her husband have to talk and to not talk about.  
In order to ensure that they'll win the crown again, Sherri has hired 
professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch).  Christy tells us 
about her family.  Her father was the disciplinarian, whereas her 
mother's role was to give "unconditional love," which she did until she 
committed suicide in 1981.
The beauty of the casting is the way that the actors don't seem like 
actors at all but just ordinary folks.  And the most ordinary of the lot 
is the movie's co-writer Eugene Levy, who plays Gerry Fleck, a 
gregarious bad-dresser.  Gerry, ironically, makes his living as a 
menswear salesman.  He was nicknamed "looper" in school for his tendency 
to walk in loops since he literally has two left feet.  
Gerry and his wife, Cookie (Catherine O'Hara), have a Norwich Terrier.  
Every guy Cookie runs into seems to have had a liaison with her at some 
time.  ("I banged a lot of waitresses in my day, but you were the best," 
a man tells her in front of her embarrassed husband at a cocktail party.  
She smiles, slightly bemused, and the guy walks away.)
When everyone finally gets to the big show, the commentary is provided 
by a smooth talking Brit, Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), and his 
obnoxious sidekick, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard).  With everything from 
sports analogies to proctology analogies, Buck successfully drives his 
companion and the audience crazy.  At our press screening, one of the 
critics got so into it that he yelled, "Oh shut-up!" to Buck.  BEST IN 
SHOW is the kind of movie that has you forgetting that it is a movie.
I don't want to give too much away, but the winner of the big show is a 
real dog.  After the canine equivalent of the big game ending, the movie 
has an extended epilogue that is perhaps the best part of the picture.  
But with a film this funny, it is hard to pick favorites.
BEST IN SHOW runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for language and 
sex-related material and would be fine for kids around 11 and up.

   Dogs are funny.  They're funny ha ha and funny peculiar.  
Who can resist grinning while watching a Shar-Pei stroll down
a city street, sticking out its tongue when passing the office of
a plastic surgeon?  Who can keep a straight face while taking
in the sight of a terrier digging and digging for nothing in
particular, or the look on the face of a bull terrier who bears a
striking resemblance to its human daddy, or the arrogant
perambulations of an Afghan Hound?
   Funny as canines are, though, people are more bizarre in
every way.  People, too, are funny ha ha and funny peculiar,
and Christopher Guest's movie "Best in Show" is ultimately
not about the parades of pooches that pass across the
picture screen but about the people who are proudly
possessed by the four-legged beasts.  The humans are the
ones who go for the cups, for the blue ribbons.  Each wants
to be the champion, the best-in-show, and like many a
neurotic parent, the handlers and owners live vicariously
through their four-legged friends.
   "Best in Show" centers on the Mayflower Dog show, held in
Philadelphia and modeled after the world-famous
Westminster Dog Show held in February of each year in New
York's Madison Square Garden.  Filmed entirely in Vancouver
with a realistic mock dog-show setup, "Best in Show" proves
that Christopher Guest can get absolutely hilarious
performances from his actors by holding them on the loosest
of leashes and allowing them to improvise their way through
this top-notch comedy.  There's no secret to Guest's
expertise at directing: just choose some of the same
performers you embraced for your previous mockumentary,
the 1997 feature "Waiting for Guffman (about the mounting of
a musical show celebrating the 150th anniversary of Blaine,
Missouri), tell them how to get from point A to point B, and let
them decide how to get there--as though you were giving a
brace of bloodhounds a sniff of a bad guy's clothing and
allowing the lovable creatures to track the felon down.
   While those familiar with dog shows know that the handlers
and owners are for the most part stable people (they come
inevitably from the suburbs), Guest obviously has no need to
show these solid, all-American types, instead taking
endearing aim at the eccentric minority who give the
competition its Purina gourmet flavor.  Yuppie lawyers Meg
(Parker Posey) and her husband Hamilton Swan (Michael
Hitchcock) would be most recognizable to big city dwellers in
the movie audience while conservative menswear salesman
Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) and his bubbly wife Cookie
(Catherine O'Hara) represent your typical suburbanites. 
Other idiosyncratic show people include a happy gay couple,
the flamboyant handler Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins)
and his partner, hair salon owner Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael
McKean); and Sherri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) as the
zoftig young wife of a senile industrialist (Patrick Cranshaw),
who has hired fellow lesbian Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch)
to show their Standard Poodle.  Others in the side-splitting
ensemble are the straight-laced Kennel Club president Dr.
Theodore W. Millbank III (Bob Balaban), Graham Chissolm
(Don Lake) as the show's chairman, Trevor Beckwith (Jim
Piddock) as the classy co-announcer of the event, and Buck
Laughlin (Fred Willard), whose manic role as the show's
announcer proves  the comedic highlight of the film.
   Anyone in the movie audience who listens to stand-up
comic Fred Willard discuss the events would learn virtually
nothing at all about dog shows but a lot about how many
pounds he can press as a middle-aged man (315) compared
to what he could do in his more potent days (500) plus some
side commentary about his visits to a proctologist.  Obviously
more attuned to what goes on in sporting events involving
only two-legged jocks, he metaphorically describes the
panorama at the Mayflower in terms of baseball and football,
reminding us that when the final competition takes place--
seven dogs lined up with only one to get the cup--we're in
"the bottom of the ninth with the final batter at the plate."  
   While Willard--and not the winning dog--steals the show,
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara turn out the most riotous
performances of the dog owners.  They, more than any other
couple, play their roles absolutely straight with the
bespectacled Levy (superb as the stiff-laced father in
"American Pie" who wants to explain the birds and the bees
to his hormone-crazed son) being driven nuts by the fellows
he meets who all seem to have dated his vivacious wife. To
add to his misery, his character, Gerry Fleck, cannot dance
because he has two left feet.  Literally.   Parker Posey
impersonates her usual high-strung character, the sort of
urban neurotic that Jane Fonda played in "California Suite,"
bickering constantly with her similarly disturbed husband who
tries to check into the hotel with no balance on his credit
card, having lost the dog's favorite toy to boot.  Their
psychoanalyst back home is the only person who could in
any way be regarded as their friend: he is paid to listen to
how their sex lives are ruined because their similarly neurotic
Weimaraner, Beatrice, glowers at them while they engage in
positions recommended by the Kama Sutra.
   The only suspense in the story rests with the question: who
will take top honors at the Mayflower show?  My own pick
differed from that of the judge, but who needs suspense
when you're rocking with laughter at the film with the most
inventive improvisational dialogue of the year?
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

        "Best in class."  "More bark than bite."  "Christopher Guest's film
has gone to the dogs."  It would be all too easy to make these kinds of
obvious asides about "Best in Show," director Guest's latest mockumentary
(or dog-umentary--there's another one), but if the performer has learned
anything since his "Saturday Night Live" days it's the art of subtlety, and
"Best in Show" is far from being a droll exercise of owners who look like
their pets.  The film follows the pampered pooches and their persnickity
owners in competition at Philadelphia's Mayflower Dog Show intercut with
that mock-interview style which Guest does so well (see: "Waiting for
Guffman").  Going for the blue ribbon are the two left-footed Gerry Fleck
(co-writer Eugene Levy) and his wife Cookie (SCTV's Catherine O'Hara)--her
randy ex-boyfriends keep showing up; a bickering yuppie couple supercharged
on Starbucks (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) whose weimeraner holds
them in high contempt; Guest himself as Carolina fly fisherman Harlan
Pepper (his skills include ventriloquism and naming many varieties of
nut--peanut, pine nut, macadamia nut); a flamboyantly gay couple (Michael
McKean and John Michael Higgins) with their hyper-coiffed Shih Tzu; and,
rounding out the field, a win-at-all-costs lesbian handler and her lover
(Jane Lynch and Jennifer Coolidge).  Outside the ring these able performers
are given an additional boost by Ed Begley Jr. as a hotel proprietor, and
Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as, respectively, a doltish ringside
commentator and his despairing, stiff-upper lipped British counterpart.
Guest's attention to detail is uncanny and that makes the deadpan "Best in
Show" remarkably assured.  You could almost call it the best of its breed.

If you liked Waiting for Guffman, you'll love Best in Show.  Both films
were directed by Christopher Guest and largely improvised by similar
ensemble casts.  Guest has clearly perfected the `mockumentary,' a craft
he honed as a performer and writer on Rob Reiner's classic film This is
Spinal Tap.  This time out, Guest point his cynical lens at a ripe
target  dog shows.
Show begins with a scene featuring two yuppie attorneys from suburban
Illinois (Michael Hitchcock, Happy Texas and Parker Posey, Scream 3).
You think they're getting advice from a marriage counselor, but as the
scene unfolds, it becomes clear that the couple is really speaking to a
pet psychiatrist (it's been done before in Bruce McCulloch's Dog Park,
but that's a minor complaint).  It seems that Meg and Hamilton Swan are
concerned that their Weimaraner, Beatrice, suffered severe psychological
damage when she saw them having sex.
The kooky Swan's are just the tip of the iceberg.  Show's other dog show
participants include:
ˇ Harlan Pepper (Guest) and his bloodhound, Hubert.  They live in
backwoods Pinenut, North Carolina, where Pepper runs a bait and tackle
shop called The Fishing Hole.
ˇ Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara from SCTV)
and their Norwich Terrier, Blinky.  Based in Fern City, Florida, the
Flecks are living proof that opposites attract.  Gerry has two left feet
(literally) and resembles Kirk Van Houten from The Simpsons, while
Cookie's past sexual promiscuity becomes a running gag in the film.
ˇ Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean, Mystery, Alaska), Scott Donlan
(John Michael Higgins, Bicentennial Man) and their Shih Tzu, Miss
Agnes.  This homosexual couple from Tribeca are, respectively, a
hairdresser and a professional dog handler.
ˇ Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge, Stifler's mom from American Pie),
Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch, What Planet Are You From?) and Rhapsody In
White, a `Standard' Poodle.  Sheri Ann is a buxom blonde married to a
man with one foot in the grave (Patrick Cranshaw from Guest's Almost
Heroes).  Christy is Rhapsody's butch trainer, and the defending
two-time champion of the Mayflower Dog Show.
Each of these dogs competes in the prestigious Mayflower event in
Philadelphia's top kennel club (a knock-off of New York's Westminster
Show), which is celebrating its 125-year of competition.  The first
round of the contest chooses the best dog from each breed.  The winners
of each breed compete for the coveted `Best in Show' award for the top
dog.
The show is hosted by two television commentators  one well informed
and serious (Jim Piddock, Mad About You)  the other a hysterically
clueless boor (Fred Willard, Austin Powers 2).  Their banter is easily
the funniest part of the film (I've got my fingers crossed that there
will be more on the DVD).
In addition to rousing drop dead hilarious performances from his cast,
Guest also adds in little touches that you might miss the first time
around.  Like the row of clocks that all give the same time behind the
front desk of the Mayflower competitor's hotel (signs underneath each
clock let you know that they're all for east coast cities, like
Baltimore, New York and Boston).
Show was loosely written by Guest and Levy, who also framed the story
for the critically acclaimed Guffman.  It's a big step in the right
direction after Guest bombed with 1998's non-mockumentary debacle Almost
Heroes.  There isn't one thing that would have made Show a more
enjoyable film (other than making it longer).  You won't see a funnier
film this year.
1:30  PG-13 for language and sex-related material

If you've ever watched the real-life Westminster Dog Show - and as an
unabashed Dog Person, I have, many times - you'll recognize the dogs
running rampant in BEST IN SHOW.  But as is often the case, the Wacky
Humans owned by those dogs, are the real show...
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Conformation dog shows, in which purebred dogs are judged against the
physical standards of their breeds to vie for the ultimate "best of
show" championship (as opposed to field trials which tests dogs for
their obedience and similar abilities) - and more important, the lengths
that the human "owners" of the dogs go through to get the coveted Blue
Ribbon - are the target of satire in this "mockumentary" revolving
around the fictitious Mayflower Dog Show.
The dogs and their hilarious humans, are:
-Beatrice the neurotic Weimaraner, whose humans are high-strung
  Illinois yuppies Hamilton Swan (Michael Hitchcock) and his wife
  Meg (Parker Posey) - most likely the cause of Beatrice's many
  Issues;
-Winky the scruffy Norwich Terrier, hailing from Fern City, Florida
  and bringing the man-magnet Cookie Fleck (Catherine O'Hara) and her
  two-left-footed salesman  husband Gerry (Eugene Levy), along for
  the show;
-Hubert the laid-back Bloodhound, accompanied by Pinenut,
  North Carolina's own Good Ol' Boy Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest),
  dog fancier and owner of The Fishin' Hole;
-Tyrone the pampered Shih Tzu, cohabitating along with his sister,
  Miss Thang (uh, Miss Agnes) with Tribeca New York gay couple
  Scott "Ice Ice Baby" Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and
  Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean);
-And the prissy Poodle and two-time Mayflower winner, Butch, who
  lives at the Cabot Mansion with young, rich Anna Nicole-esque
  Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her very old, very
  silent husband Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw), and is being
  Shown at Mayflower by the rather butch in her own right
  Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch).
Ok, so I'll say a bit more, but it all just comes back to my first
statement.  I can't remember when I've laughed more at a satire.  BEST
IN SHOW did an excellent job of deflating the craziness surrounding the
bizarre world of conformation dog shows.
The writing and directing were tight, and the human's performances were
spot-on wacky, though Michael McKean's Stefan was the most straight [uh,
no pun intended] of the lot.  Still, I hesitate to point out any of the
actors here, they were all just that good; and the fact that they could
play these caricatures with such straight faces, most def earns my
praise.  Hmmm...actually, I should point out that in addition to the
great bits from all the actors mentioned in "The Story" above, Larry
Miller as Max Bergman, one of Cookie's many ex-boyfriends, Ed Begley Jr.
as the manager of the hotel Taft, and Fred Willard as Mayflower
announcer Buck Laughlin, also had me in stitches.  Miller's
suicide-prevention guy was a straight-up riot; Begley's character had
one of the best lines of the movie (something about rock stars and
toilets; listen for it); and Willard had me rollin' with Buck's
irreverent asides about the dog show, while the hapless dog expert
Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) tried but failed to keep Buck on-track.
What amazes me most of all is that all the dogs used for this movie,
were real-life show champions - meaning that the real owners either had
a healthy sense of humor about themselves, or had no idea of what they
were getting into.  Either way, it's a delicious irony.
BEST IN SHOW tickled my funny bone in the way that only a mockumentary
about a subject I hold Near And Dear, could.  Whether you're a dog or a
cat person, you should see this flick.   Unless you're a completely
out-there dog or cat person, and can't laugh at yourself.  Don't worry;
the rest of us will laugh at you.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
Reminiscent in tone to RAISING ARIZONA, with more than a passing
resemblance to McKean's mockumentary SPINAL TAP, BEST IN SHOW certainly
was this movie week's Blue Ribbon winner, and ranks right up there with
the year's best flicks.  I don't think I'll ever be able to watch
Westminster the same way again.

It's a dog eat dog world out there and the tension is tangible as hundreds
of contestants from across America come together to participate in the
greatest event of their lives - the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show.
Director Christopher Guest follows five sets of contestants and their prize
canines as they journey to Philadelphia to compete in the prestigious event
in the mock documentary, "Best in Show."
Helmer and co-writer Guest got his mockumentary chops when he teamed with
Rob Reiner, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer in creating the brilliant fake
docu in the 1984 film, "This is Spinal Tap." In 1996, Guest joined with
Eugene Levy to create another mock doc in the charming tale about the
trials and tribulations putting together a small town pageant in "Waiting
for Guffman." Now, again with Levy, he tackles the wild and wacky world of
dog shows. Inspired by the trappings and scope of the famous Westminster
Kennel Club's annual event, Guest and his ensemble cast of the usual
suspects bring us into a world where pooches reign and owners vie for that
precious blue ribbon of a winner.
Joining Guest is a bevy of regulars who have worked with the helmer over
the years, along with some newcomers to his creative acting team. Michael
McKean is New York City hair salon owner Stefan Vanderhoof whose longtime
partner, professional dog handler Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), has
entered their precious Shih Tzu, Miss Agnes, as a contender for the
Mayflower doggie throne. Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Levy and Catherine
O'Hara), a mild-mannered salesman and his popular wife from Fern City,
Florida, have entered their handsome Norwich Terrier, Winky, as a
contestant in the show. Meanwhile, a pair of neurotic yuppie lawyers, Meg
(Parker Posey) and Hamilton Swan (Michael Hitchcock), have hopes that their
nervous Weimaraner, Beatrice, will be the big winner. Harlan Pepper (Guest)
from Pine Nut, North Carolina, thinks that his prime specimen of a
Bloodhound, Hubert, is the one to win. Finally, the wealthy and very aged
Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his voluptuous trophy wife, Sherri
Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), are certain that their two-time champion Standard
Poodle, Rhapsody in White, will once again go home with the gold.
Guest follows this group of contestants as they prepare to leave for the
Mayflower show, interviewing each as they tell him their hopes and
aspirations to win the prestigious event. They all take to the road, in a
variety of ways, and head toward their collective destinies at the
important canine event. Color is added to the various preparations and
journeys, particularly for Gerry and Cookie as she convinces her husband,
against his will, to make a side trip to visit an old boyfriend. Gerry soon
learns that Cookie didn't have dozens of boyfriends before meeting him, she
had hundreds! And these old boyfriends keep popping up though out the film,
much to Gerry's chagrin and our amusement.
The film meanders through the first half with the preparation and journey
to Philly for each team of dog and owner(s). At the mid-point, I was
declaring "Waiting for Guffman" as far better than "Best in Show." Then,
the "show" really begins. The second half takes an upturn as the filmmakers
recreate the pageantry of a top-notch, pure-breed dog show while the actors
interleave their improvisational humor with the seriousness of the event.
If you've ever spent the two days a year watching the Westminster dog show
on TV, you'll find that Guest and company did their homework well.
The mainstay of part two, in addition to the little, humorous dramas
unfolding for the contestants, is Fred Willard's outrageous perf as the
unlikely color man for the TV coverage of the Mayflower show. Buck Laughlin
is a sportscaster by trade who is brought in to commentate on the action
with the real dog show expert, Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock). Buck doesn't
have a clue about dogs and dog shows, but that doesn't stop him from making
off-color remarks and non-sequiturs about the action on the floor.
Willard's not stop, wacky chatter helps make the second half the funniest.
The large ensemble cast is given a lot of latitude in their mostly
ad-libbed performances of some rather eccentric characters. Chris Guest is
a true chameleon and puts a deft spin on his North Carolina bait shop
owner, Harlan, coming across every bit as the kind cracker who loves his
dawg Hubert. John Michael Higgins steals the show as the flamboyant dog
handler extraordinare and Stefan's lover. He plays up his naughty role,
making lewd sexual innuendo one of his favorite pastimes. Of the rest of
the cast Jane Lynch makes the next greatest impression as the self-assured
dog handler Christy Cummings, who trains Sherri Ann's prize poodle and has
a thing for her boss, too.
Coolidge, as Sherri Ann, strikes the right bosomy bimbo note as a lady who
didn't get to where she is, fabulously wealthy, because of her brains.
Guest's frequent collaborators -  Levy, O'Hara, McKean and Bob Balaban, as
Mayflower Kennel Club President Dr. Theodore W. Millbank III - all give
funny perfs and put a human spin on their individual characters. Another of
the director's regulars, Parker Posey, and Michael Hitchcock, fare the
least well as a pair of shrill, noisy yuppies who are the reason their dog
is neurotic. The dogs are champions, every one.
Guest and crew do a decent job of creating a real looking mock doc that
captures the essence of a big deal dog show. The characters that he follows
are uniformly amusing (though Meg and Hamilton grate on the nerves early
on) and their ability to improvise give the film the feel of a real group
effort.
The behind the camera efforts are first rate. "Waiting for Guffman"
cinematographer Roberto Schaefer creates a genuine looking faux doc,
shooting in super 16mm with handheld camerawork to add to the reality.
Another of Guest's usual suspects, Joseph T. Garrity, handles the
production design, from the households of the contestants to the show
itself, with distinctive flair.
"Best in Show" doesn't have the homey, even-handed charm of "Waiting for
Guffman," but it stands on all fours as a movie for and about dog lovers
and what those, at the levels shown here, are willing to go through to
bring their beloved pets to victory. The first half bogs down, but once the
show itself starts up, it all becomes OK. This is good, clean fun (there's
even a bit by Ed Begley Jr. that discusses the merits of doggie cleanup
products) that is true family entertainment. I give it a B.

Director: Christopher Guest
Writers: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy
Cast: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, 
Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard
Rated PG-13, 89 minutes
Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) is preparing his bloodhound to sniff out 
the faults in his fellow canine competitors. Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene 
Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are getting their terrier ready for battle. Sheri 
Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired trainer hope their poodle 
will win a third consecutive blue ribbon. Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) 
and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) are a gay couple who pamper their 
animal, and hope for victory. Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael 
Hitchcock) have high hopes for success with their dog. What's gotten all of 
these people and others all worked up? The Mayflower Dog Show of course! It's 
the world's most fabulous event for pooches and their owners alike. The tough 
rivalry and judges send some of the humans into states of insanity, while 
others feel less pressure. Calling this group of people quirky is an 
understatement. Using nearly the exact same cast from Guest's previous 
picture, "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show" tries for a similar triumph, 
but this judge says the picture is stale.
After "Guffman," plus previously co-writing and co-starring in "This Is 
Spinal Tap," there are few roads Guest can take for further creative 
achievement, especially in the mockumentary genre. Rather than experiment 
with something new, the director and co-writer decided to repeat himself. 
That was a mistake because this production almost negatively affects his past 
work. If someone sees this, and then goes to rent "Guff," the disappointment 
continues. Since it feels like the people of Blaine, Missouri agreed to 
appear in another film, it's rather a situation of which movie you see first. 
Either of them works wonderfully for the first spot, but watch the other sour 
in second. 
This isn't to say there's a lack of material, or that nothing is funny. 
Jennifer Coolidge is marvelous as an Anna Nicole Smith-like woman with a 
hidden sexual preference and an eccentric taste in clothing. She must have 
spent millions on a long necklace that outlines her large breasts in gleaming 
diamond fashion. While no Corky St. Clair, Guest's performance as Harlan 
Pepper is quite good. The problem is that both of these persons get little 
screen time. The most time goes to the surprisingly lackluster Eugene Levy. 
The running gag is that his wife has slept with every man they encounter on 
their drive to the show. It works, yet he's overused. I finally understand 
why people find Parker Posey annoying. Her way over-the-top bit here as a 
control freak catalog and Starbucks lover was just plain irritating. At least 
Fred Willard never lets up the enthusiasm as a dog show commentator who asks 
irksome questions to his posh British colleague. Willard's comments and ideas 
to improve the show are the high point here. The gay couple has little flair, 
and they misfire horribly. There needs to be one sane person here to balance 
it out. 
The animal and its owner(s?) that do win the title prize weren't my first or 
second choice, yet there's little mystery or tension as to who the winner(s?) 
is(are?) early on. 
While far superior, "Best in Show" shares a remarkably similar problem with 
"Scary Movie." The actors act like they know they're in a satire. That never 
works! You can see the snickering in their faces. Only when a person doesn't 
believe they're being watched can they fully be themselves, and, therefore, 
provide prime comedy. "Scary" was awfully cruel with the beings onscreen, 
something "Show," thankfully, does not do. 
At 89 minutes, this movie is entirely too long. The film tends to repeat 
itself, and the pet pampering gets annoying. There's no apparent reason 
behind all of this love and affection, besides some faux human nature. The 
dogs get treated like little children. And how do the dogs turn out? They 
emerge unscathed from this semi-humorous film that touches, but never delves 
into the many chances for humor that it covers. The real competitions are 
much more fun to watch. This doesn't reach the potential possible of canine 
mockery. Guest should go back to the drawing boards, or maybe back to Blaine.

Funny how we take so many things in our lives for granted. I see and do
things all the time without thinking about any of the people behind the
scenes of it all, and this film is a perfect example of one of the things
that I've never really thought about. Dog shows. I've always known about
them, I've caught a glimpse of them on the Sports Network from time to time,
but I've never really sat down and thought about what they truly consisted.
But have no fear, because writer/director Christopher Guest has come up with
an excellent mockumentary featuring the dogs, the people and all the rest of
the obsessive insanity that goes on behind the scenes at these dog shows.
PLOT:
A faux documentary featuring several dog owners preparing to take their
prize pets to the big show in Philadelphia. Along the way, we get an insight
into the world of dog shows, as well as all of the competition, neurotic
owner behavior and everything else that you'd expect from a "hobby" which
some people obviously take too seriously.
CRITIQUE:
A very funny, original take on the world of dog shows, filled with many
memorable characters, hilarious commentary and even some constructive
education about the industry behind the shows themselves. I'm more of a "cat
guy" myself, but you don't need to love dogs to enjoy this movie. The many
well-developed kooky characters are what drew me into this film, and I just
loved watching all of these actors riff left and right. Give Eugene Levy and
Catherine O'Hara some of the highest praise in this regard, with super
chemistry, perfect tit-for-tat dialogue sessions and one especially
hilarious sequence with Larry Miller as an old flame. You see, O'Hara's
character used to be "easy" when she was young, and the film features many
very funny moments of her former conquests crudely making points about their
trysts together, right in front of her timid husband. We also have the
extremely neurotic snooty couple, Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, who
feel the need to bring their dog with them to their psychiatrist and who
simply cannot seem to control their own diva-esque behavior. Kudos to both
of them, and especially on whoever decided to slap braces on the poor fools.
Nice touch.
The two final couples also offer many moments of chuckle in their own right,
especially the flamboyant gay character portrayed fabulously by John Michael
Higgins, and the very controlling dog trainer played intensely by Jane
Lynch. I mention all of these names and all of these characters because they
are what make up the fabric of this entire movie, and if you don't like
them, then you will more than likely not "get" this movie. I appreciated
them all, save for Christopher Guest's own character in the film, and I
especially loved two of the "smaller" personalities in the movie. The first
is Ed Begley Jr. (where has he been?) who slurps it all up as the manager of
the host hotel and Fred Willard, who in unquestionably the funniest thing
about this movie. He literally steals the show as one of the commentators of
the big dog show finale, and delivers some of the best lines that I've heard
all year. You couldn't find a bigger boob to add color commentary to the
show than this very misinformed gentleman! And a great job by his straight
man British co-host as well. Overall, I don't believe this comedy is suited
for most people. There is a lot of dry and satirical humor here, which may
not be appreciated by some. But for anyone who loved Guest's WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, knows of the improvisational techniques perfected here by all
participants, and just plain loves dogs, this puppy is a perfect companion
for this fall's lazy weekend getaway. Funny and original...nice combo!

Directed by Christopher Guest. Screenplay by Guest and Eugene Levy.
Starring Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey. Running time: 90
minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 4th, 2000.
I'm a cat lover by nature. The only pets I've ever kept have been cats,
and I have absolutely no interest in owning a dog. Sure, I like dogs in
general (well, some dogs), and I can appreciate the pleasure that others
derive from them. But I've never comprehended the more bizarre extremes
that dog owners can sometimes go to: dressing them up, trimming them in
bizarre patterns, that kind of thing. And I definitely don't understand
dog shows.
Christopher Guest ("This Is Spinal Tap") seems to share my perplexity. His
new mockumentary "Best In Show" is a delicious parody of the dog show,
complete with eccentric competitors, bombastic hosts, and even
idiosyncratic pets. It is not a scathing attack on dog shows -- the movie
is too gentle and bemused for that -- but it certainly has a lot of fun at
their expense.
Guest follows several dog owners as they make their way to the Mayflower
Kennel Club's annual show in Philadelphia. None of them are entirely
normal. There's Guest himself who portrays Harlan Pepper, the backwards
proprietor of a backwoods fishing gear store. Harlan's mood seems
perfectly matched by his faithful bloodhound, and it comes as little
surprise that his world is comprised of very little beyond his dog and his
store.
Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey play Hamilton and Meg Swan, a couple
whose pooch seems to have developed a severe case of depression. Meg
thinks it's because the dog walked in on them having sex, but maybe it's
because the two high-strung individuals are perpetually stuck in
hypertense mode. (Tellingly, they first saw each other at Starbucks -- not
the same Starbucks, of course, but two Starbuckses across the street from
each other). One of the movie's best scenes has Posey, desperate for a toy
to replace their dog's missing stuffed bee, entering a pet store and
irrationally ranting against the clerk (Hiro Kanagawa) because, although
he has several similar toys, he doesn't actually stock a plush bee. When
Posey finally picks a toy at random, the clerk is in disbelief: she has
successfully chosen the least bee-like toy in the store.
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are Gerry and Cookie Fleck, a pair of
middle-aged losers. Gerry has two left feet -- literally -- while Cookie
seems to be intimately familiar with virtually every man on the dog
show circuit. The Flecks are completely obsessed with their dog, to the
extent of even composing songs (really, really awful songs) in his honour.
Then there's Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as homosexual twosome
Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan. Scott is flamingly gay and loving it,
while Stefan is more of a sophisticate. It's telling that, of all the
couples in the movie, theirs is probably the most stable relationship.
Scott's prance when walking their shih tzu around the convention floor is
perfect: he's as much on display as the dog.
Jennifer Coolidge plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot, the voluptuous wife of an
aged and sickly millionaire. One early scene sees Sheri Ann painfully
trying to provide examples of substance in their marriage. She ends up
asserting that they share great conversation, and equally valuable
"We could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk
about," she explains. Sheri Ann is the owner of a toy poodle (surely the
most nauseating canine in existence) which has won best in show at the
Mayflower two years running, and is competing for a third win. Assisting
Sheri Ann is professional trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), who seems
as interested in Sheri Ann as she is in the dog itself.
Rounding out the principal cast are Fred Willard and Jim Piddock, who
portray the television commentators for the dog show, Buck Laughlin and
Trevor Beckwith. Buck is a loud, vapid man in the grand tradition of
American football announcers; he obviously knows as much about dogs as he
does quantum physics. Beckwith is his long-suffering sidekick, who
desperately tries to steer Buck back on-topic when he starts rambling
about dressing the dogs up in Sherlock Holmes outfits to improve their
chances.
With the feel of something that has been at least partly improvised, "Best
In Show" manages to maintain a spontaneous feel while still setting up a
number of hilarious set pieces. Guest is equally adept at capturing
smaller comedy moments, emphasising the strange habits and obsessions
which are brought out during events like these. Consider the hotel manager
(Ed Begley Jr) who offers a learned discourse on the topic of what 
cleaning agents are best for the variety of pet accidents he encounters.
On its own, it's a dry but reasonable topic; put into the context of "Best
In Show", its faint absurdity becomes evident.
"Best In Show" does lose its way somewhat around the middle of the film,
as the comic potential of the characters on their own seems to near
exhaustion. Fortunately, just as ennui starts to creep into the
proceedings, we move from the preliminaries into the dog show itself,
which revitalises the film. In particular, the introduction of the double
act of Willard and Piddock is wonderful, and their commentary is amongst
the picture's highlights.
Several of the actors also stand out, particularly Posey and Higgins, who
attack their roles with great gusto. On the other hand, a couple of
characters never quite seem to find their way; McKean's Stefan, for
example, lives in the shadow of the outlandish Scott, and surprisingly
Guest's own Harlan Pepper is a man who always seems to be building up to
a punchline but never actually gets there.
All the same, there is a lot to recommend in "Best In Show". Given his
success here, I'd love to see Guest tackle something which attracts
similar levels of obsession and hysteria in the future. If Guest let loose
at a dog show is this funny, I can only imagine the hilarity which would
ensue should he train his sights on, say, a science-fiction convention...

    There's something about dog shows that's terribly
amusing. I know those who show off their purebreds take them very,
very seriously, but for onlookers, like Christopher Guest, the
possibilities for comedy are endless. In fact, sanity goes to the dogs
where Best of Breed trophies are concerned. This wacky mockumentary, a
worthy successor to "Waiting for Guffman," centers on Philadelphia's
annual Mayflower Dog Show, similar to New York's Westminster Dog Show.
Diverse contenders include, from Illinois, a bickering, neurotic
yuppie couple (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock) with Beatrice, their
depressed Weimaraner; from Florida, a milquetoast menswear salesman
(Eugene Levy) with, literally, two left feet and bubbly, his
promiscuous wife (Catherine O'Hara), showing Winky, their Norwich
Terrier; from North Carolina, a fly-fishing shop owner (Christopher
Guest) with his beloved Bloodhound Hubert; from New York, a
flamboyantly gay couple (John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean) with
Miss Agnes, one of their Shih Tzus; and from the Main Line, a trashy
trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired handler (Jane Lynch)
with their two-time champion Standard Poodle, Rhapsody in White. Plus
there's the show's President (Bob Balaban), chairman (Don Lake), and
mis-matched commentators (Jim Piddock, Fred Willard), along with a
long-suffering hotel manager (Ed Begley Jr.)  Guest and his
co-scripter Eugene Levy obviously encouraged their ensemble cast into
improvisational riffs that are executed with somewhat predictable but
barkingly loony, fast-paced finesse, particularly the one-liners and
non-sequiturs. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Best in Show"
is a dementedly funny 9. It's a hilarious howl - a walloping woof!

If you can't get enough of the mockumentary genre ... here's another one 
from Christopher Guest (lead guitarist Nigel of "Spinal Tap") and Eugene 
Levy (bumbling father in "American Pie" and much earlier sketch comic 
with SCTV). These two funny men loosely drew up the script together, 
"Our outline gives a very solid blueprint to the actors so they know ... 
to get from point A to point B, but how they do it is largely up to 
them," says Levy. Both costar in the film while Guest directs. 
The Documentary follows five couples on their quest to win the Mayflower 
"Best In Show" cup for their pretty purebred pets. Out of fabulous Fern 
City, Florida comes the husband and wife team, Cookie and Gerry (Levy). 
Cookie's pre-marriage swinging provides the fuel for follies with nerdy 
hubby Gerry. 
Yuppie Starbucks types, Meg and Hamilton, broadcast most of the stress 
and dysfunction, with relationship tension as tight as the wires in 
their full-mouth braces. 
Harlan Pepper (Guest), a fly fisherman from North Carolina, can name 
every type of nut in the forest and moonlights as a veteran home 
ventriloquist. 
Scott and Stefan are the gay couple; while voluptuous Sherri says of 
wealthy aged husband, "We have a lot in common. We both like soup," and 
"We can always find something to not talk about for hours." 
Fred Willard nails the bit part of color commentator, a hundred times 
more knowledgeable about baseball than dogs. His canine-inanities are 
fielded by a low-key British expert. The frisky contrast of the two is 
sparkling. 
All involved do a strong job of improvisational acting. The direction 
and editing is tight and the humor very often delightfully dry. I 
enjoyed it.

It's a dog eat dog world out there and the tension is tangible as hundreds
of contestants from across America come together to participate in the
greatest event of their lives - the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show.
Director Christopher Guest follows five sets of contestants and their prize
canines as they journey to Philadelphia to compete in the prestigious event
in the mock documentary, "Best in Show."
Helmer and co-writer Guest got his mockumentary chops when he teamed with
Rob Reiner, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer in creating the brilliant fake
docu in the 1984 film, "This is Spinal Tap." In 1996, Guest joined with
Eugene Levy to create another mock doc in the charming tale about the
trials and tribulations putting together a small town pageant in "Waiting
for Guffman." Now, again with Levy, he tackles the wild and wacky world of
dog shows. Inspired by the trappings and scope of the famous Westminster
Kennel Club's annual event, Guest and his ensemble cast of the usual
suspects bring us into a world where pooches reign and owners vie for that
precious blue ribbon of a winner.
Joining Guest is a bevy of regulars who have worked with the helmer over
the years, along with some newcomers to his creative acting team. Michael
McKean is New York City hair salon owner Stefan Vanderhoof whose longtime
partner, professional dog handler Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), has
entered their precious Shih Tzu, Miss Agnes, as a contender for the
Mayflower doggie throne. Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Levy and Catherine
O'Hara), a mild-mannered salesman and his popular wife from Fern City,
Florida, have entered their handsome Norwich Terrier, Winky, as a
contestant in the show. Meanwhile, a pair of neurotic yuppie lawyers, Meg
(Parker Posey) and Hamilton Swan (Michael Hitchcock), have hopes that their
nervous Weimaraner, Beatrice, will be the big winner. Harlan Pepper (Guest)
from Pine Nut, North Carolina, thinks that his prime specimen of a
Bloodhound, Hubert, is the one to win. Finally, the wealthy and very aged
Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his voluptuous trophy wife, Sherri
Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), are certain that their two-time champion Standard
Poodle, Rhapsody in White, will once again go home with the gold.
Guest follows this group of contestants as they prepare to leave for the
Mayflower show, interviewing each as they tell him their hopes and
aspirations to win the prestigious event. They all take to the road, in a
variety of ways, and head toward their collective destinies at the
important canine event. Color is added to the various preparations and
journeys, particularly for Gerry and Cookie as she convinces her husband,
against his will, to make a side trip to visit an old boyfriend. Gerry soon
learns that Cookie didn't have dozens of boyfriends before meeting him, she
had hundreds! And these old boyfriends keep popping up though out the film,
much to Gerry's chagrin and our amusement.
The film meanders through the first half with the preparation and journey
to Philly for each team of dog and owner(s). At the mid-point, I was
declaring "Waiting for Guffman" as far better than "Best in Show." Then,
the "show" really begins. The second half takes an upturn as the filmmakers
recreate the pageantry of a top-notch, pure-breed dog show while the actors
interleave their improvisational humor with the seriousness of the event.
If you've ever spent the two days a year watching the Westminster dog show
on TV, you'll find that Guest and company did their homework well.
The mainstay of part two, in addition to the little, humorous dramas
unfolding for the contestants, is Fred Willard's outrageous perf as the
unlikely color man for the TV coverage of the Mayflower show. Buck Laughlin
is a sportscaster by trade who is brought in to commentate on the action
with the real dog show expert, Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock). Buck doesn't
have a clue about dogs and dog shows, but that doesn't stop him from making
off-color remarks and non-sequiturs about the action on the floor.
Willard's not stop, wacky chatter helps make the second half the funniest.
The large ensemble cast is given a lot of latitude in their mostly
ad-libbed performances of some rather eccentric characters. Chris Guest is
a true chameleon and puts a deft spin on his North Carolina bait shop
owner, Harlan, coming across every bit as the kind cracker who loves his
dawg Hubert. John Michael Higgins steals the show as the flamboyant dog
handler extraordinare and Stefan's lover. He plays up his naughty role,
making lewd sexual innuendo one of his favorite pastimes. Of the rest of
the cast Jane Lynch makes the next greatest impression as the self-assured
dog handler Christy Cummings, who trains Sherri Ann's prize poodle and has
a thing for her boss, too.
Coolidge, as Sherri Ann, strikes the right bosomy bimbo note as a lady who
didn't get to where she is, fabulously wealthy, because of her brains.
Guest's frequent collaborators -  Levy, O'Hara, McKean and Bob Balaban, as
Mayflower Kennel Club President Dr. Theodore W. Millbank III - all give
funny perfs and put a human spin on their individual characters. Another of
the director's regulars, Parker Posey, and Michael Hitchcock, fare the
least well as a pair of shrill, noisy yuppies who are the reason their dog
is neurotic. The dogs are champions, every one.
Guest and crew do a decent job of creating a real looking mock doc that
captures the essence of a big deal dog show. The characters that he follows
are uniformly amusing (though Meg and Hamilton grate on the nerves early
on) and their ability to improvise give the film the feel of a real group
effort.
The behind the camera efforts are first rate. "Waiting for Guffman"
cinematographer Roberto Schaefer creates a genuine looking faux doc,
shooting in super 16mm with handheld camerawork to add to the reality.
Another of Guest's usual suspects, Joseph T. Garrity, handles the
production design, from the households of the contestants to the show
itself, with distinctive flair.
"Best in Show" doesn't have the homey, even-handed charm of "Waiting for
Guffman," but it stands on all fours as a movie for and about dog lovers
and what those, at the levels shown here, are willing to go through to
bring their beloved pets to victory. The first half bogs down, but once the
show itself starts up, it all becomes OK. This is good, clean fun (there's
even a bit by Ed Begley Jr. that discusses the merits of doggie cleanup
products) that is true family entertainment. I give it a B.
Director/cowriter/star Christopher Guest follows up his sweet small town show
comedy "Waiting for Guffman" with a loony look at a wildy assorted bunch of
nuts who live for their pooches in "Best in Show."  While not as even as
his prior effort, "Best in Show" offers some inspired comic performances
wrapped up neatly at the climatic (and fictious) Mayflower Dog Show.
Guest and his cowriter and star Eugene Levy introduce us to the cast in
their own environments.  Appropriately Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey 
and Michael Hitchcock, "Waiting for Guffman") are first found in a 
psychiatrist's office because their Weimaraner Beatrice is depressed after 
witnessing them recreating a Kama Sutra act.  Of course, it's really Meg and 
Hamilton, catalog shopping, brace wearing yuppies, who have the problems.  
Their freakouts are initially funny, but become shrill with repetition, making 
them the least engaging of the dog owners.
Cookie and Gerry Fleck (Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, "Waiting for 
Guffman") are a blue collar couple who compose and sing songs praising the 
charms of the Norwich Terrier for their neighbors.  Gerry is dismayed to
discover just how many former boyfriends his bubbly wife Cookie had, but
that's nothing compared to the trauma of having to show Winky when Cookie's
injured because Gerry literally has two left feet.  O'Hara and Levy are
reliable members of Guest's troupe and work good comic improvisation here.
Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean, Guest's costar in "This Is Spinal Tap")
and Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins, "Jeffrey") are a gay couple with
joint Shih Tzus who hope their Miss Agnes will win.  Stefan's the older,
more grounded but lovingly indulgent partner while Scott camps outrageously
(and hilariously) while constantly fussing over his wardrobe.
Steel baron Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw, "Everyone Says I Love You")
and his trophy wife Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge, "American Pie") own
Mayflower's two time winning standard poodle Rhapsody in White.  Sherri Ann's
affections appear to be won by their handler, however.  She's Christy
Cummings (Jane Lynch, "The Fugitive"), a butch kennel owner who's climbed
atop the heap via the Cabots' sponsorship.  Lynch gives a terrific performance
as a tightly wound dog person who's over confidence covers deep rooted
insecurities.  Coolidge is a ditz who believes her way with a makeup
trowel makes her an artist while her plastic surgery enhancements approach
those of real life socialite Jocelyne Wildenstein.  Cranshaw has no
dialog, appearing to have one foot in the grave already, and quickly drops
out of the picture.
Guest himself is Harlan Pepper, a Southern fly-fishing shop owner who just 
adores his bloodhound Hubert.  He's the most low key, but listen for his subtle
comedy when he discourses on fly-fishing tackle at the pre-show reception.
The true star of "Best in Show," however, isn't one of the competitors, but
the Mayflower's vapid color man Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard, "Waiting for
Guffman").  His jaw-droppingly inane, non-stop prattle is an inspired
parody of any TV commentator who's tried to fill dead air space with the
sound of his own voice.  Playing beautifully against Willard is Jim Piddock
as Trevor Beckwith, a British dog expert who gives up even attempting to
converse with Buck.  
Guest allowed his cast to improvise based on his and Levy's story outline
and shot sixty hours of film, which he's whittled down to just over 90 minutes.
This collaborative effort looks like it was about as much fun to make as
it is to watch.
