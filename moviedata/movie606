Directed by Brett Ratner. Screenplay by David Diamond and David
Weissman. Starring Nicolas Cage, Tea Leoni, Jeremy Piven. Running time:
124 minutes. Rated PG for mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on December

Charles Dickens did it first, of course, and also did it best. His 1843 "A 
Christmas Carol" was, to my knowledge, the earliest major work in which a 
character finds redemption and turns his life around after witnessing 
other lives and times -- some real, some merely possibilities. Next came 
Frank Capra's classic 1946 film "It's A Wonderful Life", which spun the 
concept only slightly by having as its protagonist a truly good man, who 
is shown what the world would be like if he never existed.
"The Family Man" is another slight variation on the themes embraced by 
Dickens and Capra. The main character this time around is Jack Campbell 
(Nicolas Cage), who is a bit of a cross between Ebenezer Scrooge and 
George Bailey. Jack is "a credit to capitalism" according to his boss -- a 
pragmatic businessman who handles multi-billion-dollar mergers and his 
latest romantic conquest with comparable skill. Things could have been 
different. In 1987, Jack left his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni), 
for an internship in London. Despite his promises, he never returned.
But Jack is not a bad man. On Christmas Eve, he intervenes in a 
convenience store hold-up, talking the culprit (Don Cheadle) out of the 
store. During their conversation, Jack professes that he is missing 
nothing from his life, which gets a rise out of the would-be robber. The 
next morning, Jack wakes up to discover his life has changed. Somehow, he 
has been married to Kate for the past thirteen years, has two kids and a 
dog, and sells tires for a living. Again encountering the man from the
convenience store, Jack learns that he is being given a glimpse of the 
life he could have led, for reasons he is supposed to figure out for 
himself.
"The Family Man" hews predictably close to the structure laid out by 
Dickens. Jack is initially hostile toward his fate, refusing to accept a 
life of changing diapers, mixing chocolate milk, and hawking the BF 
Goodrich line. Gradually, he warms up to this life, learning that, even 
though his life with Kate is missing many of the perks of his "real" life, 
it is nonetheless richer in more important ways. Where "The Family Man" 
differs from its predecessors is that it is far less obvious how this new
understanding will affect Jack once he returns to his normal existence.
In some ways, this is "The Family Man"'s chief flaw. Unlike Scrooge or 
Bailey, both of whom were heading down indisputably dark paths, it's not 
all that obvious that Jack Campbell needs saving. There is something 
rankling about the film's implicit assertion that, because his life is not 
middle-America-perfect, Jack has made poor decisions. Sure, his existence 
might not be ideal, but it's not so terrible either. It leaves one to 
wonder why Cheadle is wasting his time with somebody like Jack when there 
are other people in the world in far more desperate need of divine 
intervention.
But despite its clunky execution, "The Family Man" resonates with 
undeniable warmth. Despite the thematic problems it creates, the movie's 
refusal to paint Jack as a Scrooge-type villain creates a refreshingly 
original feeling. This is not simply "A Christmas Carol" (or, for that 
matter, "It's A Wonderful Life") all over again, but an altogether 
different take on the concept. Jack is neither a blackguard nor a hero, 
but a regular guy caught in a seemingly untenable situation.
As a result, there is a certain authenticity to the scenes of Jack 
becoming accustomed to his parallel life. His relationship with "his" 
children, his attempts to engage in interests he himself never possessed 
(bowling, for example), and the occasional intrusions of his actual life, 
all strike a genuine chord. It's enough to make you wonder how we might 
react under comparable circumstances. By the end of Jack's "glimpse", the 
movie has convinced us that this other life is the ideal Jack should have 
been striving for, even if, objectively, that is not necessarily the case.
A large part of this is due to the splendid performances by Cage and 
Leoni, who demonstrate terrific on-screen chemistry. They make it clear 
that Jack and Kate are meant to be together, no matter what sacrifices 
had to have been made to accomplish it. One of "The Family Man"'s true 
delights is the slow revelation of all the little things that make this 
parallel life so gifted -- alternate-Jack's wedding anniversary surprises, 
for example, or the circumstances under which he came to work at the tire 
store. It is difficult not to be moved by Jack's gradual realisation of 
his deep, long-denied love for Kate, and this makes the viewer's knowledge 
of the impermanence (as Cheadle puts it) of Jack's experience all the more 
lamentable.
The screenplay, by David Diamond and David Weissman, has plenty of charm, 
even if it does occasionally indulge in its share of kitsch. A predictable 
scene in which Jack tries to change the baby's diapers, for example, is an 
excursion into unnecessarily sitcom-level humour which mercifully does not 
go on for too long. For the most part, though, Diamond and Weissman do a 
good job of balancing comedy and drama. They also successfully maintain 
the reality of Jack's alternate life, not demanding too much suspension of 
disbelief in the way other characters react to Jack's strange behaviour. 
Helmer Brett Ratner is even-handed in his direction, rarely letting the 
movie get too corny and providing some beautifully touching moments as 
well.
Sentimentality is a tough thing to pull off in movies. Handled well, it
can make for a memorable cinemagoing experience. Handled badly, the result 
is often a thoroughly rotten work of film. "The Family Man" is not 
perfect -- it certainly won't supplant "It's A Wonderful Life" as a staple 
of holiday viewing -- but it is one of the more successful sentimental 
films in recent memory. It's a movie that's difficult to watch without 
smiling, frequently. To do otherwise would be positively, well, 
Scrooge-like.

Just in time for Christmas comes a story worthy of both Ebenezer and
Jimmy Stewart, with Wild at Heart's Nicholas Cage cast in the role of
the out of touch rich guy.  Jack Campbell (Cage) is not a bad man.  He's
not even a callous man.  He's just a regular guy who happens to believe
that millions of dollars, a beautiful blonde lover, and a Ferrari in the
garage are ample compensation for whatever he may be missing in the way
of mediocre suburban living.
But when this good-natured Wall Street mega-titan puts his life on the
line to save a convenience store from a firefight, he makes a big
mistake.  Because that kid with the pistol (Don Cheadle) is no ordinary
hoodlum -- he's some kind of wacky angel or
ghost-of-Christmas-in-a-parallel-universe or something.  And little does
Jack know, as he lay himself down to sleep on Christmas Eve, that he'll
wake the next morning to the life he could've had if only he'd married
his college girlfriend (Téa Leoni, Deep Impact) instead of following his
ambition to become one of the world's richest, most powerful men.
The movie tries earnestly to make a case for the intrinsic value of
middle class life, but fails miserably to pull through, largely because
it makes power brokering look so easy and fun.  I won't bog you down in
all the little details of Jack's boring suburban life, but suffice it to
say he makes the honest, simple life seem pretty unappealing.
Cage's performance is strong enough, at times even believable, but his
hairpiece needs some serious work.  Leoni is a subtle charmer as the
spunky mother of two, and Cheadle's work in the beginning of the film
carries a potency not seen since his appearance in Boogie Nights.  But,
oddly enough, it is the child actor Mackenzie Vega who adds the most
dimension to the picture as Annie, the Campbells' precocious daughter. 
The only really funny or heartwarming moments in the film revolve around
Annie's frank (but misguided) understanding that Cage is not her real
father but an alien come to observe our planet.  Never has the phrase
"Welcome to Earth" drawn such touching laughter from an audience.
(Except maybe in ET.  Did they say that in ET?)
The Family Man is, in the end, a carefree tale of love and bad New
Jersey accents.  For every man who's ever wondered what life he could
have had if he'd never married the mother of his children, this film has
the answer.  And, just as you might have suspected, you may have been
better off alone.  While the film fails in many ways to reach a
memorable conclusion, it just might carry enough soft-hearted cheer to
make a tired old married couple smile on Christmas eve.

Sort of a modern-day rendition of 1946's holiday classic "It's a Wonderful 
Life," "The Family Man" is a fantasy in which a wealthy Wall Street dealer is 
given a chance to glimpse the wildly different way his life would have turned 
out had he married his college sweetheart. Aside from the premise, the film 
is not likely to become a perennial Christmas mainstay, due to its uneven 
tone and flawed, obvious screenplay that backs itself into a corner in which 
no possible conclusion could possibly be satisfying.
Opening in 1987, Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) is about to board a plane to 
begin a one-year internship in London, much to the pleading of his beloved 
girlfriend, Kate (Tea Leoni). If he gets on board, she instinctively tells 
him, their strong relationship will not survive a year apart, and their lives 
will go different directions. Fast forward to the present day, Jack thinks 
that he has it all: a great job that is making him loads of money, a very 
expensive Ferrari, a sleek apartment in a fashionable Manhattan skyrise, and 
a sometimes-girlfriend (Amber Valletta) who he basically uses for sex. 
Following a chance encounter with a street hustler (Don Cheadle), Jack 
awakens on Christmas morning in the suburbs of New Jersey, with two young 
children and a wife in Kate. Instead of a high-powered exec on Wall Street, 
he works for the tire dealership named after his father-in-law (Harve 
Presnell), and instead of a wardrobe consisting of an endless series of 
suits, he owns mostly sweatshirts and sweatpants. Although something is very 
different about the way Jack is acting to his new life, it is his precocious 
5-year-old daughter (Makenzie Vega) who speaks up about it, believing that he 
is an alien who has taken over her father's role. At first, Jack longs to 
return to his old, true life, but the more time he spends with his newfound 
family, the more he realizes what he has missed all these years, and how much 
he truly loves the effervescent Kate.
Directed by Brett Ratner (1998's "Rush Hour"), "The Family Man" is an 
occasionally sweet, but mostly trying experience that isn't written up to the 
intelligence of its two main actors. Taking a well-worn story that has been 
done before in a superior fashion ("A Christmas Carol" comes instantly to 
mind), the film grows tiresome very quickly, due to the predictable nature in 
which it plays itself out. A more lighthearted tone and a less-protracted 
length (it runs over two hours) might have made the movie an enjoyable piece 
of Christmastime fluff, but it overstays its welcome, hammering home a thin 
message that could have been solved in a lot less time. 
The main offender is its screenplay, written by David Diamond and David 
Weissman, which lingers more upon the drama of the situation, rather than the 
comedy. While this approach could have worked, the film just isn't very 
smart. The rocky, but loving, relationship between Jack and Kate does not 
play itself out naturally, as almost every one of their scenes plays itself 
out in a particular fashion, with everything starting to look up until one of 
them says something that angers the other, leading to an argument. For a 
romance to work in the movies, there has to be genuine passion involved, and 
this is particularly difficult to establish when they can't seem to get along 
for longer than five minutes. A lot of their conversations deal with how much 
they love each other, or how beautiful and spectacular one of them finds the 
other, but with the evidence presented here, it is difficult to root for two 
people who are interesting and likable as individuals, but annoying as a 
couple.
Nicolas Cage (2000's "Gone in 60 Seconds") and Tea Leoni (1998's "Deep 
Impact") are both very good actors, and they do give it their all, even while 
their characters are merely going through the motions. Cage successfully 
exhibits the longing his character of Jack begins to feel when he discovers 
he doesn't, in fact, have it all, while Leoni is touching and strong-willed 
as the amiable Kate, who doesn't understand why her husband has suddenly 
grown so questionable about family life.
All of the supporting roles are wasted, and any subplots that result from 
them go unfinished. Jeremy Piven (1998's "Very Bad Things"), as Jack's best 
friend, is on hand to do nothing more than remind him of what a great catch 
Katie is, while Lisa Thornhill (1997's "Meet Wally Sparks"), as a woman who 
wants to have an affair with Jack, is a bright screen presence who is 
woefully underutilized. Don Cheadle (2000's "Mission to Mars"), taking up 
where Will Smith left off in "The Legend of Bagger Vance," is the 
otherworldly person who allows Jack to see the things he has missed by 
choosing the path he took thirteen years before. Only Makenzie Vega has good 
screen time as Jack and Kate's daughter, and she is quite an impressive young 
actress, adorable and talented without ever being cloying.
While the message that "The Family Man" wanted to make was apparent from the 
first twenty minutes, the way the story was going to wrap up was more of a 
mystery. Since most of the movie isn't actually real, but a look at what Jack 
could have had, it almost seems like a waste, and no matter how things were 
concluded, the ending would be severely problematic. Having seen the finale, 
all I can say is that it isn't terrible, but also far too tidy for its own 
good. That is the notable flaw of "The Family Man," in general. Instead of 
genuinely playing itself out, it is simply too neat--too disingenuous--to be 
worthwhile.

I could relate to the main character in this movie. No, I am not a family
man (yet), but I am presently going through a period in my life, where work
has taken precedence over much else, and despite most of it paying off,
certain sacrifices are being made to succeed on a professional level.
Nicolas Cage's character in this film begins as quite the successful
businessman. The sacrifices that he made earlier on in his life obviously
paid off for him on a professional level. But would his life have been
better if he had not given up his love all those years ago?
And in that same vein, will I, the sad-sack movie critic, also find myself
looking back years from now and regretting many of the things that I am
presently giving up, in order to thrive in this one area of my life? God
knows. But this movie allows Cage's character to live the life he would have
had, if he hadn't given up his love way back when. Sadly, this is just a
movie and the only way that I will ever know if my present decisions being
made are the right ones, would be to "pretend" to be the main guy in this
film. Yeah, that's right...I'm the lead character...yeah, yeah...that's it!
PS: Me thinks I'm working too hard.
PLOT:
A wealthy man gets the chance to live his life as he would have, if he had
made a certain decision 13 years ago. You see, this guy had the opportunity
to either go to England for a posh new job or stay at home with his honey.
He chose to go to England, made it big, but never loved again. Now, he's
getting the fantastical opportunity to live his life under the former
circumstances. Would it be a better life? Would it make him a better person?
Would it make for an entertaining picture? Let's see.
CRITIQUE:
The feel good movie of the holidays? You bet! This flick is sure to be a
crowd pleaser. It's basically a rehashed mish-mash of several other
successful Christmas movies including IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and SCROOGED,
with touches of humor, solid acting all around, a nice, cozy feel, a cutesy
story and Nic Cage back in the saddle again. It's real nice to see the big
lug moving back towards the ol' Nicolas Cage that we all knew and loved
before those darn action-blast-'em-ups stole him away from us. You go, girl!
Harumph...but let's get back to the movie. Now despite my general sense of
appreciation for this film, I did think that it ran a little longer than it
should have. I believe a little 15-minute nip and tuck job would have made
it just right. Not that it ever got boring. The film is actually quite
upbeat, grabbing the audience immediately with insight into the one big
secret that nobody in the film seems to know about. Which is always cool. In
fact, the entire film ain't nothing but a sweet thang. Not necessarily an
original piece or one that'll have you tap-dancing on sidewalks on your way
home, but definitely one which deserves a lot of credit for treading over
familiar territory, and coming up with fresh twists and enjoyable material.
In fact, the film reminded me a lot of REMEMBER THE TITANS in that sense.
Both movies seemed to include material that we'd seen in other films before.
Both movies carried in them characters in whom we'd invested ourselves
before. And both movies seemed to make the story line quite predictable from
early on. But in end, both films worked because the characters in each one
and their respective plot lines were solid across the board. You believe
Cage's story. You really do see him coming into his own as this "new"
person. You really do find humor in many of his newfound responsibilities,
from which much of this film's humor is derived. But the movie also works as
a romance, a drama about relationships. A cutey-patootie Christmas movie. I
personally liked the way that they ended the film (which I won't spoil
here), but I think others might be a little disappointed. A personal call.
One thing that I do think most people won't be able to deny is the quality
entertainment that this film is able to provide. The movie's got a big
heart, plenty of humor, a dash of romance, a nice score from Danny Elfman,
an interesting story and well-developed characters. And what is it that they
say about snowflakes? They all look alike from afar, but up close, each one
is actually very different. This film is not original but it works. Warm up
the blankies, people, this one is made for the chestnuts, the open fire and
the corny holiday lovers in us all.

If you like your movies lengthy, derivative and shockingly predictable,
then haul your ignorant ass down to the theatre to see The Family Man,
Hollywood's umpteenth version of a holiday film that shows a soulless
central character pulling a Christmas Eve about-face after getting a
glimpse of the way things were, could have been, or are going to be.
Man, like Charles Dickens' `A Christmas Carol' and Frank Capra's It's a
Wonderful Life before it, shows a guy being visited by a ghost/angel who
takes the character on a wild ride to show him the error of his ways.
Here, the George Bailey/Scrooge character is Jack Campbell (Nicolas
Cage, Gone in 60 Seconds), and our first glimpse of him reveals Jack to
be a man with a mission.  The scene takes place at an airport in 1987,
where Jack is about to depart for a big post-college internship at a top
London investment firm.  Despite the schmaltzy pleadings of his
lawyer-to-be girlfriend Kate (Téa Leoni, Deep Impact), Jack hops on his
plane without giving a second thought to what he's leaving behind,
opting instead to stake his claim in the business world.
Man then flashes forward 13 years, where the still-single Jack has a
penthouse apartment in Manhattan, a Ferrari, a giant closet full of
$2,400 suits and a powerful Wall Street job.  It's Christmas Eve, and
Jack's company is set to announce a giant corporate merger on December
26th.  This, of course, gives him the opportunity to crack the whip
while his employees whimper about not being able to spend the holidays
with their families (one is played by Dick's Saul Rubinek  like he's
suddenly celebrating Christmas).
A strange combination of eggnog, a Lotto ticket and five magic words
(`I've got everything I need') triggers the appearance of The Ghost of
Christmas What-Could-Have-Been, or, in this case, a gunwielding angel
played by Traffic's Don Cheadle (which makes Man yet another film where
Whitey is shown The Light by a black character).  Jack laughs off the
encounter until he wakes up on Christmas morning living the life that
would have been his if he had stayed in New York with Kate back in '87.
At this point, Man becomes the third film this year to showcase a
character living a life that isn't really theirs (following Passion of
Mind and the much more enjoyable Me Myself I).  Jack goes through all of
the predictable disbelief you would expect from a man who has gone from
a life of luxury to a suburban New Jersey hell with a wife, two kids, a
slobbery dog and, worst of all, a job selling tires (retail, no less)
for Kate's father.  Like Me Myself I, the only person who notices
something rotten in the state of Denmark is one of Jack's kids  a
precocious six-year-old who talks like she's two.
As you would expect, Jack immediately wants out, but eventually warms to
the married life (and who wouldn't with a wife like Leoni?).  The best
part of the film isn't even in the film  the use of Talking Heads' Once
in a Lifetime (`This is not my beautiful house/this is not my beautiful
wife') happens only in Man's trailer.  Every plot development in Man can
be seen coming a mile away, and most of the things that work are glossed
over and/or cut short.  It would have been great to see how Jack got
through a day of pretending to know the ins and outs of the tire
business instead of watching him change his first poopy diaper, but only
the latter made it into the film.
Man's script, which was written by David Diamond (of the Ice-T/Alyssa
Milano `thriller' Below Utopia fame) and David Weissman (Dream a Little
Dream 2  who knew they made a sequel?), is a hackneyed hack-job that
leaves many side stories unresolved.  What becomes of Jack's near affair
with the comely wife of a friend (played by Lisa Thornhill)?  And what's
the deal with Jack's fat buddy, who is supposed to be having a triple
bypass the day after Christmas but is shown bowling instead?  My bet is
that some things were chopped out of the final cut when test audiences
didn't react favorably to them.  Either that, or director Brett Ratner
(Rush Hour) is an incredibly bad storyteller.  Regardless of the reason,
it's still not good.
In the acting department, Leoni is the clear standout, stealing every
scene she shares with Cage.  She perfectly embodies her sassy, spunky,
satisfied character, and is completely believable in doing so.  It's
refreshing to see Cage attempt a role where he isn't either dark and
brooding, or a stupid action hero.  That said, he has one of the
creepiest smiles in the business.
Man wasn't more than 30 seconds old before the schmaltz made my eyes
roll back in my head.  It's reduced a Frank Capra film to, frankly,
crap.  I can't recall a film striving this fervently to be mediocre 
nothing more, nothing less.  Even the usually reliable Danny Elfman
(Sleepy Hollow) provides a surprisingly calculated score.  Technically,
the highlight is Dante Spinotti's (Wonder Boys) photography.
People wonder why critics give poor marks to films that infrequent
moviegoers might find heartwarming.  The answer is simple  we have to
sit through three or four of the exact same films every year.  Man is
one of those films.

In the romantic comedy, "Family Man," Jack (Nicolas
Cage) is blessed with a second chance to see how his
life would have turned out if he'd gone ahead and
married his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni).  He
actually left Kate long ago, putting his career ahead
of love.  And now, he has become a
master-of-his-own-universe, investment banker.  But
thanks to a chance encounter with a mysterious angel
(Don Cheadle), he is offered a glimpse into this other
life where he is her devoted husband, father of two,
and the proud owner of a sorely-in-need-of-a-tune-up
minivan.  
With this setup, a few burning questions arise.  Are
there any lessons that Jack can learn about himself? 
Did he make the right choice leaving Kate all those
years ago?  Most importantly, will his outlook be
changed in such a way that it will make him a better
man?  These are the answers that I had wanted to know
because the premise of the film follows in the vein of
"It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Christmas Carole."  But
in this uninspired screenplay, neither path that Jack
chooses really provides him with the fulfillment that
he personally seeks.  As a result, the movie doesn't
provide the sentimental charge that it seems to want
to deliver, and what we're left with is a lackluster
story whose title should have been called: "Either
Life is OK".
Needed to create the required impact is to see that
Jack is actually better off with Kate.  But is he?  In
real life, Jack is a high finance wizard who is the
midst of orchestrating a gigantic merger.  With his
business savvy and charisma, his company as well as a
slew of women revere him.  Yes, he's a slave to his
work and he even toils on Christmas Day.  Yet, having
a walk-in closet filled with $2000 suits and an exotic
car doesn't seem all that bad.  Meanwhile, his 'dream'
existence puts him into the lifestyle of a
middle-class, blue-collar salesman at a tire store
where the highlights of his week are shopping at the
Burlington Coat Factory, bowling with the guys, and
eating funnel cakes.
This isn't really anybody's idea of a better life, is
it?  But, it is made all the more tolerable thanks to
Kate, his adoring wife.  Tea Leoni gives a robust
performance in what may be the only bright spot to
this film.  She's affable and having the chance to get
back together with her would be hard to pass up.  
But this speaks to another shortcoming, which is the
lack of chemistry between Cage and Leoni.  They give
good individual performances but we don't buy into
their romance.  Even as Jack develops his first-time
sense of belonging and sharing, as a couple, they
don't seem to connect.   There's a lack of tenderness.
 It's missing the spark that is needed to emotionally
draw in the audience.
The most appealing aspect is the film's
lightheartedness, which mostly focuses on the fact
that Jack WAS a person that had everything, but is now
a blue-collar, child rearing, 'have-not.'  Watching
him report to work as a mag wheel salesman for Big
Ed's Tires is a hoot.  Yet, for the film to have risen
above an otherwise humdrum romantic comedy, Jack's
catharsis needed to be more remarkable.  Is he truly
better off as a family man?  I'm still wondering.

In this romantic fantasy, Nicolas Cage plays a high-flyer on
Wall Street who has everything he wants: wealth, power, position,
disposable women and not a shred of regret. But through some
mysterious time-travel magic wielded by Don Cheadle, he wakes up on
Christmas morning in bed next to his college sweetheart, played by Tea
Leoni, and discovers they've been married for 13 years, have two
adorable children and a large dog, and live in suburban New Jersey,
where he sells tires for his father-in-law. There's abundant humor as
he fumbles finding his new identity and, gradually, comes to enjoy
this alternate universe, discovering the life he could have led if he
had made different choices. The funniest moment occurs when Cage's
daughter realizes the ruse and concludes that her real dad has been
abducted by aliens. "Welcome to Earth," she lisps. Writers David
Diamond & David Weissman and director Brett Ratner are obviously
trying for a spiritual, Capra-esque "It's A Wonderful Life" flavor -
with a hint of "Me, Myself and I," "Sliding Doors" even "Groundhog
Day" - but there are two flaws. First, Cage's character obviously
relishes his single, self-centered life with great gusto. Second, in
his new life, he still wants to go where the money is, conniving to
get not only himself but his new family back into the expensive
lifestyle of Manhattan. Plus, there are other plot loopholes, like
pivotal supporting characters disappearing, never to be seen
again. Nicolas Cage is at his best coping with crisis situations, even
dirty diapers, less comfortable with warm, cuddly moments, and Tea
Leoni is radiant and lovely, breathing life into a role that could
have been one-dimensional. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Family Man" is a sweet, sentimental 8. A better title might be "It's A
Wonderful Wife."

Nicolas Cage, as Jack Campbell, the wealthy president of a 
mergers-and-acquisitions firm, is living La Dolce Vita in his Manhattan 
penthouse and savoring every minute of it.  With $2,400 suits, a 
lightning-fast Ferrari and his own limo, he has it all, right down to a 
"closet" that is like an expensive men's clothing boutique.
Well he thinks he has it all until an angry man with a gun (Don Cheadle) 
interrupts Jack's life to show him a "glimpse" of what he is missing.  
David Diamond and David Weissman's imaginative script is equal parts 
SLIDING DOORS, A CHRISTMAS CAROL and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.   Director 
Brett Ratner, known for his broad comedy RUSH HOUR, shows that he is 
capable of surprising subtlety and grace.  THE FAMILY MAN is touching 
and poignant without ever getting anywhere near schmaltz.  Even if it's 
more effective as a romantic drama than a comedy, it does have many 
wonderfully funny moments.
The story opens at the airport in 1987, where Jack is leaving his 
college girlfriend Kate (Téa Leoni, DEEP IMPACT) for a one-year 
internship abroad.  Fearing that their relationship will not survive the 
oceanic separation, she makes a futile, last minute plea for him to 
stay.
We quickly cut to 13 years later, when it's Christmas Eve.  Jack has his 
troops working on a 120-billion dollar merger deal.  His old lover, 
Kate, has called out of the blue.  Jack's chairman (Josef Sommer) 
advises him not to return the call.  "Old flames are like old tax 
returns," he tells Jack.  "Put 'em in a file cabinet for 3 years and 
then cut 'em loose."  Currently with model-quality girlfriends, Jack 
doesn't seem the least bit interested in ever dialing Kate's number.
The mysterious character played by Don Cheadle shows up, and before Jack 
knows it, he is "trapped in the suburbs" in a New Jersey house with 4 
bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, a partially finished basement, a big slobbering 
dog, 2 young kids and a wife, Kate.  He thinks that he is still rich, 
but he isn't, and that he really isn't the family man of his new 
household, but he is.  Cage's frozen, wide-eyed expression tells it all 
about his absolute panic.  He is convincingly confused, shocked, lost 
and scared.   Most of all Jack is appalled by the ordinariness of his 
new lifestyle.  A big day for the new Jack is getting treated to a 
funnel cake at the mall.  His new life is almost a complete opposite of 
everything he has worked for.
In a film about Cage's character, Leoni does a terrific job of not being 
upstaged by Cage.  She takes what could just be a one-dimensional 
character and gives it depth, tenderness and a playful joy.
The script, wisely, lets only one person, Jack's little daughter Annie 
(Makenzie Vega), figure out that Jack has changed.  In an adorable 
performance by Vega, Annie decides that Jack is an alien.  Still, she is 
happy to show him the ropes on how to be a father, including how to 
diaper her brother Josh.  One of the biggest laughs comes when Jack 
leaves Josh at daycare.  "Do I get a receipt or something?" he asks at 
the daycare center as he hands off his son, holding him as if he 
contained toxic waste.
The big question about the narrative is how the story will circle back 
once the glimpse is over.  With a completely satisfying resolution, the 
movie leaves you with a warm spot in your heart.  A perfect film for the 
Christmas season, its messages about the meaning of success and the 
importance of family is presented with straightforward and genuine 
warmth.  An honest picture and a cute one, although not worthy of 
Christmas classic status, it is rewarding and enjoyable.
THE FAMILY MAN runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for sensuality and some 
language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was "okay" and gave it **.  He 
complained that he was confused by Cheadle's character.  His favorite 
parts involved the kids and the dog.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, December 22.  
In the Silicon Valley it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.

THE FAMILY MAN (2000) ** Director, Brett Ratner. Writers, David 
Diamond, David Weissman. Photography, Sante Spinotti. Editing, Mark 
Helfrich. Production design, Kristi Zea. Music, Danny Elfman. Cast: 
Nicolas Cage, Tea Leoni, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven, Saul Rubinek, et 
al. A Universal release. 125 minutes. PG-13.
Another Opera (with suds). Its  Overture.is in 1977 at  Kennedy 
Airport. Jack (Cage) is off to a one-year internship in a major 
London  bank. The camera  focuses on him and his girl Kate. (Leoni) 
as the mike picks up their gloppy kisses in surround-sound stereo. 
Kate has premonitions, begs Jack not to leave--but he does.
Jump ahead 13 years. Kate is out of the picture. Jack is a 
mover-shaker on Wall Street, Ferrari-driving, chic, fast-talking, 
authoritarian. He's  called a meeting on Christmas eve to finalize a 
financial coup.
Next morning, he wakes up in his regal apartment with a beautiful 
call girl at his side. She departs. He greets the day joyfully, 
bellowing atrociously the aria "La Donna e mobile," selecting his 
suit from a enormous collection of  priced-through-the-roof outfits.
Later he goes to a convenience store in which bum-like Cash (Don 
Cheadle.) irrupts to redeem his winning lottery ticket. Accused of 
having doctored it he goes wild, pulls out a gun. Jack intervenes and 
makes a deal with Cash. (Cheadle is very good, as is the whole 
sequence). The bellicose fellow will turn out to be a sort of angel 
whose  mission is to give Jack the chance to see what other road he 
might have taken.
The morning after Jack wakes up in a tatty house in a New Jersey 
suburb.. It is his house, complete with wife of 13 years Kate ( 
hardly aged) and kids. He labors at his father-in-law's tire store, 
consorts with working-class people, has a K-Mart. wardrobe. etc. Is 
this a fall  from grace?
The Family Man's schlock for the holidays is a feelgood fantasy in 
the lineage of excellent movies like It's a Wonderful Life, Here 
Comes Mr. Jordan, the latter's remake Heaven Can Wait (with Warren 
Beatty), plus a slew of others, some good some bad. The genre is 
crowd-pleasing but tricky to make and as delicate as thin crystal.    
Hours before this movie's preview I had watched Cocteau's enchanting 
Beauty and the Beast which has its own, its fairy-tale logic. But The 
Family Man is a juggling act, awkward, often trite, with a plot that 
keeps painting itself into corners.  The screenwriters must have had 
long bull-sessions about what to do next (which is a mess) and how to 
wrap things up (which is even messier).
Jack, conscious of both his lives, hates everything about his "new" 
one and his semi-blue collar existence. Yet this milieu of "little 
people" is supposed to be a good life, while that of the tycoons is 
bad.           
Story holes come in avalanches. Just one example. Kate is a 
low-income lawyer with social consciousness. She does pro bono 
(uncompensated) work for those in need. But since both she and Jack 
graduated from Law School, whatever turned him into a tire salesman?
You can bet your life that Jack will falling love with Kate and the 
kids. But then he wants to have his cake and  eat it, which tangles 
matters artificially and makes our suspension of disbelief grow 
exponentially.
There are some good (and/or funny) bits, including the couple's young 
daughter who  thinks that Jack is not her father but an 
alien clone--shades of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers  (Lite). 
But the tortuous plot and deja vu, by-the-numbers performances, are 
more for viewers who think "movies" rather than "cinema." --and 
that's not a snobbish remark. Cheadle's role is much too short and 
vague. Nicolas Cage is an actor I like, but I have the feeling that 
he has accepted too many roles that encourage a sameness in 
performing them. Here, in a variant of the (apocryphal?) judgment for 
Fred Astaire's first screen test, the verdict might be: "Can't sing. 
Can't dance. Can act a little."
On the other hand, Tea Leoni does grace the picture. There's a chance 
connection with her first ever role, in Switch, where a man dies and 
returns to earth as a woman. Leoni's was a bit part. Small roles 
followed in  A League of their Own and others. Then she was 
third-billed in Flirting with Disaster" and second-billed in Deep 
Impact. The predictable mass appeal of The Family Man will make her a 
star. But for my money, I'll stick to my favorite holidays movie, A 
Christmas Story.

Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) is the president of his own Wall St. investment
firm and is on the verge of cementing a multi-billion dollar merger on
Christmas Eve.  When his intrigued secretary (Mary Beth Hurt, "Bringing Out 
the Dead") gives him a message from his college fiance of twenty years ago, 
he takes a 'guy poll' and decides to ignore it as 'water under the bridge.'  
One encounter with a convenience store robber (Don Cheadle, "Mission to Mars") 
and a night's sleep later, Jack awakens on Christmas morning to find his wife 
Kate (Tea Leoni, "Deep Impact") next to him and a young daughter and large dog 
piling onto his bed in "The Family Man."
Screenwriters David Diamond and David Weissman take a little bit of "Me
Myself I," a dash of "It's a Wonderful Life" (in reverse) and a helping 
of their own original twists for the holiday-set "The Family Man."  While
the film sounds like warmed over offerings, its sparkling cast and a few
inventive riffs on an old outline make this a welcome holiday entertainment.
We already know Kate is Jack's old girlfriend, because the film begins with
a flashback (which we know is a flashback by the PanAm backdrop) of Jack
leaving a tearful Kate at the airport.  They have a plan to get solid footing
before marriage - him by interning at Barclay's Bank in London, her by going
to law school back home - which she begs him to abandon because of her
intuition.  One scene later, we know her intuition proved correct.
Jack has disposable women, $2,500 suits, a Ferrari and confidence to spare.
His first move after awakening in surburbia is to dash out in horror and
take the family minivan back into the city.  No one recognizes him, however,
and that mysterious 'robber' returns in his Ferrari to tell him that his 
actions during the tension of the night before allowed for him to get a second 
look at life.
Jack returns to his new home to be met by his best friend and next door 
neighbor (Jeremy Piven, "Very Bad Things") telling him how lucky he is.  Jack's 
aghast at the messy surburban life he now has complete with diapers, dog
slobber, chores, a blue class wardrobe and job as a tire salesman for his
father-in-law.  Even though Jack knows no history of this life, only his 
daughter Annie notices his oddness, asking where her dad has gone.  Kate 
accepts his cluelessness as part oddball humor, which they clearly have a 
history of, part midlife crisis.
The screenplay is interesting in that some things have progressed similarly
(Jack is hit on by a sexy friend), others are changed (his nebbishy underling
(Saul Rubinek, "The Contender") is now the more authoritative president of
his old company).  Things that seem radically different (Jack's new career)
are given interesting explanations as the story progresses.  Jack attempts
to blend his new persona with his old one.  The film's conclusion is not 
exactly what the audience might expect and presents new concepts to ponder.
The best thing about "The Family Man," however, is seeing Nicolas Cage finally
give an engaging performance again.  His return from the increasingly zombified 
performances he's been giving in one actioner after another is most welcome.  
Cage nails the complexities of a somewhat arrogant, assured man who also is, 
at heart, decent.  His comic bafflement, sweetness with children and sexiness
with woman showcase his romantic comedy chops better than anything he's done
since "Moonstruck."  Equally engaging is Tea Leoni, who simply has never been
better.  She's funny, strong, quick-witted and sexy and a dynamic foil for
Cage.  Support is solid all around.
The film was directed by Brett Ratner (whose 'a film by' credit is a bit
pretentious for the young director of "Rush Hour"), showing an ability to
cross genres after his hit actioner of two years back.  The film's well-paced
and gives a nice contrast between the different lifestyles (even if
Jack is able to park directly in front of anywhere he wants to go in
downtown Manhattan in both incarnations).
"The Family Man" is not only a sure-footed romance, but may become a minor
holiday classic as well.

   I once worked with a guy--we taught together in a New
York City public high school--at a time that teachers had
become unionized and were making fairly good pay.  He
wasn't happy. I thought we were doing OK.  He said, "C'mon,
Harv...everyone I graduated from college with is making lots
more than we are.  When the big corporate boys tell you that
teachers are doing fine, that's just to keep us quiet, to make
us think we're better off than we really are."  This fellow
sounded unhappy.  Despite the allegedly low pay he griped
about, he had purchased a three bedroom house--OK, it was
in a less fashionable area of New Jersey--but it was a new
house, it was built by Levitt (so there was not much
differentiation between his and his neighbors') but, what the
heck.  He had a nice wife, three kids who didn't become
dopers or criminals, a new car every five years.  He kept
talking about Harry, Dave, and Mike who got out of Columbia
U. the same year as he did who were making big bucks on
Wall Street or in the computer business.  "But are they
happy?" I'd say with a grin, knowing that this led to his usual
response.  "Damn right they are, and you would be too if you
made their dough."
   There we go with the old question: does money buy
happiness?  Or to put this another way, can you be
pleased most of the time if you made a decent, honest living,
had a loving wife that made you the envy of your neighbors,
and two adorable kids...and if so, what are the chances you'd
be happier as this family man than as an arbitrage expert
living in a posh Manhattan pad with no wife and no children? 
Who knows?  We send a man to the moon but we still don't
have a happiness meter.
   No matter.  Brett Ratner tells us the answer in "The Family
Man," a Capra-esque comedy-drama not as sentimental as
"It's a Wonderful Life" but with some acting that updates the
Jimmie Stewart-Donna Reed qualities to the 21st century. 
About the big question: wonderful family with a decent living
vs. no family and big bucks, which is better...would I be
giving it all away if I mentioned that the movie opens during
Christmas week?
   Turns out that "The Family Man" is the best date movie of
the year.  The individuals whose lives are explored are not
callow twenty-somethings who are too young to have a clue
beyond their sophomoric discussions, but two people in their
mid-thirties who are leading a mostly wonderful life in their
modest New Jersey dwelling with a daughter of about six and
an infant still in diapers.  The story takes off during an
emotional scene at JFK airport as Kate (Tea Leoni) tries to
persuade her boy friend Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) to
chuck his flight to London where he is to begin a promising
career in high finance.  She wants him to look at a modest
life with her, convinced that once Jack gets on the fast track,
it's goodbye relationship.  Jack pulls away, boards the plane,
and some time later is seen as the president of a company
about to arrange a 130 billion merger deal.  But he's single,
he has lost touch with Kate, and he lives in a tony co-op on
Manhattan's East Side.  He's content enough until he finds
out what he could have had--as a mysterious man (Don
Cheadle), not quite a Bagger Vance type but still equipped
with formidable powers--transports Jack temporarily into the
kind of life he would have had if he took the road not taken.  
Instead of reporting to CEO Lassiter (Josef Sommer), he
takes on the responsibilities of being husband to a far prettier
person and father to two adorable but demanding youngsters.
   Nicolas Cage does best when he's cornered...put into
dramatic situations whether of life and death (as with his role
as the suicidal drunk in Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las Vegas") or
off-the-wall intensity as in John Woo's "Face/Off"--in which he
and Travolta both fly over the top beautifully.  Life-and-death
stakes are introduced here, but Brett Ratner--giving a well-
paced visual display of Diamond and Weissman's screenplay-
-is more interested in spiritual life than in the physical one. 
The one flaw that I see in the film is that Cage's character is
hardly dead spiritually when he is doing the job he was made
for across the polished mahogany tables in his high-stakes
firm.  He sings in the elevator, he is delirious at the thought
of sewing up another difficult deal, he has a beautiful woman
visit him in his Manhattan digs quite enough to satisfy him. 
Should he give it all up to grow old with the likes of Tea
Leoni's Kate?  Take a look at this riveting beauty and you
might be tempted to say so.
   Ratner should elicit considerable interest from his audience
with a sci-fi gimmick which has us think: How would I survive
if suddenly I were plunged into a world in which none of the
people I work with recognized me and all the people of my
new life knew me while I was acquainted with only one of
them?  The picture combines a twilight-zone ambiance with a
sentimental, but not cloying, comedy-drama making "The
Family Man" some difficult-to-beat holiday fare.
