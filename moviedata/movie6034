Trolls  elves  gnomes  hey, that's not even what Dungeons and Dragons
is about.  It was more of a description of the film's target
demographic. Now calm down, Poindexter.  A movie isn't worth
hyperventilating over. Put down your inhaler and listen for a second.
Dragons is easily one of the year's worst films, and there's a very good
chance it could run away with multiple Razzie Award nominations for its
excessive crapulence.  The film not only rips off major elements and
themes from a bunch of other movies, but it fails to execute them in a
successful manner, as well.
Dragons is set in chaotic Izmer, a land ruled by Empress Savina (Thora
Birch, American Beauty).  Savina wants to restore power to the common
people of Izmer, but she meets great resistance in the form of the
diabolical Mage Profion (Jeremy `What the Hell Happened to My Career'
Irons).  Together with his bald, blue-lipped henchman, Profion has just
come into control of some magic stick that can control the powerful Red
Dragons of Izmer.  For some reason, he needs to get his hands on
Savina's magic stick to complete his evil doings.
Considering that the battle over the magic sticks is the main plot of
the film, it's quite odd that both Savian and Profion disappear for the
80 minutes in the middle of the movie.  That large chunk of time is
filled with the story of two thieves  Ridley (Justin Whalin, Jimmy
Olsen from the Lois & Clark series) and Snails (Marlon Wayans, Requiem
For a Dream)  and their adventures with a cute apprentice Mage named
Marina (newcomer Zoe McLellan).  The even get to hang out in a cantina
full of strange creatures (a la Star Wars) and go through a deadly maze
full of traps (a la Raiders of the Lost Ark).
Here's a question for you, Poindexter:  Who in their right mind would
make a film based on a game that, as far as I can tell, hit its
popularity about 15 years ago?  I'll tell you who  producer Thomas M.
Hammel, who also greenlit dead-in-the-water projects like Howie Long's
Firestorm and Cindy Crawford's Fair Game.  Dragons' director has no
feature-film experience, which is pretty obvious from his inability to
pull anything but wooden performances from any of his actors.
Irons (Lolita) seems way too enthusiastic to be in this film, and Birch
performs like she's been run over with a Rohypnol truck.  This isn't
what you'd expect from, respectively, an Oscar winner and somebody who
is hot off a role in last year's Best Picture champ.  The pick of the
litter is the newcomer McLellan, who kind of resembles a dark-haired
Claire Danes (right down to her inability to pick a good script).
Wayans is awful, and his character is only slightly less annoying than
Jar-Jar Binks.
Wayans has accomplished the Triple Crown of film this year.  He's been
in one of the year's most profitable films (Scary Movie) and one of the
year's best-reviewed films (Requiem).  Now he's in one of the year's
worst, too.
1:49  PG-13 for fantasy action violence

    What's in your imagination is usually far better than what
filmmakers can project on the screen and never was that more true than
with this tedious sword & sorcery epic that lifts liberally from "Star
Wars," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Hercules," "Xena: Warrior Princess"
and the old "Sinbad" movies. Based on an elaborate role-playing game
which has intrigued young minds since 1974, the plot revolves around a
young thief (Justin Whalin), his buddy (Marlon Wayans), and a pretty
magician (Zoe McLellan) who become embroiled in a battle between the
idealistic Empress of Izmer (Thora Birch), who wants equality and
prosperity for all her people, and the evil sorcerer Profion (Jeremy
Irons), who wants to depose her. Since the Empress has a scepter to
summon Golden Dragons, Profion dispatches his henchman (Bruce Payne)
to find the Rod of Savrille that summons a stronger species, the Red
Dragons. Written by Topper Lilien & Carroll Cartwright and directed by
Courtney Solomon, it's quite confusing and complicated. The acting,
however, is abominable.  Justin Whalin - dismissed by the villain as
"Pretty Boy" - smirks and struts like Han Solo, while Marlon Wayans
mugs outrageously in a JarJar Binks imitation and Thora Birch does her
Princess Leia routine.  Jeremy Irons is ludicrous with his leers, and
Bruce Payne has a perpetual sneer on his metallic blue lips. So
where's the $36 million budget? Visual effects. I did like the elves
with their Vulcan ears, but movies based on games rarely satisfy their
core audience. Remember "The Super Mario Brothers" and "Clue"?  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dungeons & Dragons" is a cheap,
cheesy 3. At one point, Wayans wails, "This is dumb, dumb, dumb." I
agree. And Payne promises, "It was a mistake. It will not happen
again." One hopes.

In another world, the Empress Savina (Thora Birch) has decided to eliminate 
the caste system by making commoners equal to mages. The mage council, led 
by the ambitious Profion (Jeremy Irons), obviously doesn't like this, and 
demand that Savina turn her scepter of what's his face over to them. The 
scepter gives its user control of gold dragons. Profion decides that to 
combat the empress, he must obtain the rod of so and so, which will give him 
control of red dragons. He sends his henchman, Damodar (Bruce Payne), after 
it. Meanwhile, two thieves, Ridley and Snails (Justin Whalin and Marlon 
Wayans), and a young apprentice wizard named Marina (Zoe McLellan) are 
trying to locate the rod so they can destroy it for the empress. They team 
up with a drunken dwarf (Lee Arenberg) in desperate need of a napkin, and an 
elven tracker (Kristen Wilson) in desperate need of a personality, and go 
out to face the armies that await them. Yet time is running out for the 
Empress, and Profion is gaining more and more allies in the council. Can our 
heroes succeed? Will justice prevail? Will you manage to stay awake?
I have to admit, when I first heard about the Dungeons and Dragons project a 
couple of years back, I was rather looking forward to it. I'd enjoyed the 
game years ago, and we get so few fantasy movies I thought it would be a 
nice change of pace. Then, perhaps eight months ago, I saw the first screen 
shots from the film and doubts began to form in my mind. It would appear 
these doubts were well justified. In fact, it could be argued that Dungeons 
and Dragons is the worst film of the year (though in my opinion that crown 
still belongs to Battlefield Earth). Yet in some ways, the film reminded me 
more of Highlander: Endgame, in that it should never have hit the big 
screens, but been marketed as a direct to video release. The special effects 
are of the same cheesy lot found on afternoon action shows like "Xena: 
Warrior Princess" (I know, after Dragonheart no dragon would look good 
enough, but these are really bad); the costumes look like they were 
purchased at the local Halloween costume shop; the acting is so atrocious it 
cannot be adequately described; and the story will most likely baffle those 
over the age of 12 who have never played the role playing game.
Can no one act in this god forsaken movie?! That's the thought that was 
running through my head throughout the film, and alas, it seems no one 
could. Justin Whalin (Jimmy Olsen from "Lois and Clark") leads our 
talentless cast with a performance that would have been more appropriate to 
your average high school play. Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie) goes out of his 
way to prove he's the least talented Wayans brother. His brand of completely 
out of place ghetto speech is so annoying it might just make you wish Jar 
Jar Binks would show up (well... maybe not that annoying). Zoe McLellan is 
certainly attractive, but don't expect her to win any major awards for her 
performance other than the razzie. Bruce Payne (Highlander: Endgame, what do 
you know?) is painfully bad as the bald, lipstick wearing, and not even 
remotely intimidating Damodar. The man's idea of acting consists of 
whispering horrible dialogue while contorting his face into various looks of 
disgust (possibly at his lines). Amongst a legion of bad actors, Payne 
stands out as the worst. I'm still in shock that Jeremy Irons (The Mission) 
of all people actually signed on to this movie, but there he is, hamming it 
up like you've never seen before. At least he seems to be having a good 
time, even if the audience isn't. As for Thora Birch, who showed real 
promise with her performance in American Beauty, all her talent seems to 
have vanished into thin air. Of course, she only has about ten minutes of 
screen time, and in a movie filled with really horrible dialogue, she gets 
the worst. Every word that comes out of her mouth is simply dripping with 
cheese. An example of her average line would be "I know this within the 
depths of my soul." Ouch. Of course, she delivers all these lines in the 
same, monotone voice, which somehow manages to make them even worse. Tom 
Baker, Doctor Who himself, turns up briefly as the king of the elves; one of 
the film's few pleasant surprises.
When a film starts with a voice-over narration explaining things that still 
don't make any sense afterwards, you know you're in for a bumpy ride. 
Unfortunately, this movie wasn't just bumpy, it was more like being stuck in 
a hurricane for an hour and a half. This piece of garbage has single 
handedly destroyed the good name of D&D. Wait, it didn't have a good name... 
that's a neat trick. In addition to the horrible effects, costumes, 
dialogue, acting, direction, sets, etc., the film makes one more major 
blunder. At times, it actually tries to convey some sort of moral message. 
When the film tries to be profound, it's really, really bad. When it sticks 
to being light-hearted and kind of goofy, it's.... really, really bad. 
You're no doubt wondering if a movie called Dungeons and Dragons has any 
dungeons. There are legions of cheesy looking dragons, and yes, there is one 
dungeon. It consists of Ridley going through three different traps while a 
group of thieves watch, betting on whether or not he'll survive. We're told 
that countless people have tried to beat these traps and failed. I don't 
know who these people were, but they must have been blind and wheel-chair 
bound since I could have beaten these traps and I'm none too light on my 
feet.
The question now, is what could have been done to improve this movie? Well, 
targeting things at an adult audience would have helped. Perhaps with a real 
adult cast (I'm so tired of teenage "actors" I can't see straight), and a 
real adult director (this is Solomon's first film and it shows), and a real 
adult script (why do all bad movies seem to have multiple writers?), this 
could have been something. In other words, if you had completely changed 
everything about the movie, it could have been tolerable. So is there 
anything good about this movie other than Tom Baker's appearance? Well, the 
final battle scene is alright, I suppose, in a cartoonish sort of way. It 
features a lot of obviously fake dragons battling it out over an obviously 
fake city while obviously fake actors playing wizards hurl fireballs at 
them. As for the film's score, by composer Justin Caine Burnett (who? 
exactly), it's perfectly suited to the movie because it's just as irritating 
and cheesy as the antics on screen. Dungeons and Dragons runs 105 minutes, 
although it will feel like three times that. I'd recommend the film to fans 
of cheesy movies, because this is one of the cheesiest I've seen in some 
time; and to people who thought Battlefield Earth was unfairly panned. I 
give it one and a half out of five stars.

Jeremy Irons (Academy Award-winner for REVERSAL OF FORTUNE), we didn't 
know you had it in you.  When you go slumming, as you do in Courtney 
Solomon's DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, your acting is not just merely awful but a 
major league stinkeroo.  
Assuming you're not destitute and it isn't your evil twin in the 
picture, the only possible explanation left is that your work in the 
movie is one big inside joke.  With your snarls and exaggerations, you 
chew up the scenery with crude abandon.  You must hope that any film 
this bad has to become a cult classic, and that, if it does, your part 
in it will eventually be seen as a huge spoof.  Someday you can tell the 
movie magazines that you intentionally tried to see just how terrible 
you could be.  Watching you is such an embarrassment that I hope your 
strategy proves correct.  I refuse to assume that you acted this 
pathetically unless it was on purpose.  
To be fair, the performance by Thora Birch (Academy Award nominee for 
AMERICAN BEAUTY) is not much better.  Looking like a little girl playing 
dress up, she delivers her lines with such awkwardness that she would be 
rejected for a community theater production.
The minimal plot, set in medieval times, involves the control of dragons 
and the saving of the empire.  With ugly and clunky special effects, the 
picture is no joy to watch.  
"Please help me!" asks a character with iridescent blue lipstick played 
by Bruce Payne.  He appears to want to be put out of his misery.  Where 
is the bubonic plague when you need it? I wanted them all to die and the 
sooner, the better.
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS runs a long 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for fantasy 
action violence and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, and some of his classmates who saw the film with 
him really liked it.  They thought it started slow, but the maze and the 
fighting scenes were awesome and the special effects were cool.  Their 
ratings were pretty high: **** (Jeffrey, Steven, Kyle and Sam), *** 1/2 
(Alan), *** (Nick) and ** 1/2 (John).

Cast: Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, Zoe McLellan, Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch,

2000 - 108 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for violence and mild profanity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, December 10, 2000.
The role-playing game, "Dungeons & Dragons," has had a heavy cult following 
since the mid-1970s. Although popularity has seemed to have faltered in 
recent years, it has taken two-and-a-half decades for the game to be adapted 
into a live-action feature. Not being a close follower of the game, "Dungeons 
& Dragons," the film, had to stand on its own for me, and it does. Knowing 
very few particulars of the plot before stepping into the theater auditorium, 
it was relatively easy to follow and kept me fairly interested for the 
entirety of its running time (a great feat, indeed, for someone who isn't a 
fan of sword-and-sorcery stories). 
The problem with the movie does not have as much to do with its entertainment 
value as it does about its clearly restricted budget (reportedly 
$36-million), which is simply not enough money to do such an epic story 
justice, as well as its decidedly threadbare screenplay, by writer-director 
Courtney Solomon. The appearance of dungeons are few and far between, while 
the only sign of dragons come during the first and last ten minutes of the 
108-minute running time. The war of dragons that make up the grand finale are 
impressive visual effects, indeed, but not overwhelming. They always look 
like well-done computer-generated graphics, rather than actual 
living-and-breathing creatures, as do most of the backgrounds. If anything, 
the effects in "Dungeons & Dragons" are picture-perfect examples of realism 
and artistry compared to the recent haphazard bomb, "Battlefield Earth."
Set in the mythical empire of Izmer, 17-year-old Empress Savina (Thora Birch) 
is in the midst of a controversial fight with the dastardly Profion (Jeremy 
Irons), a powerful magic-user. The Empress wholeheartedly believes that the 
upper-class Mages and lower-class commoners should finally be treated as 
equals, while Profion disagrees. In an attempt to capture a powerful rod that 
controls the kingdom, Profion sends his henchman Damidar (Bruce Payne) out to 
find it, while bright-eyed commoners Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails 
(Marlon Wayans), along with Mage Marina (Zoe McLellan), find themselves on 
the opposing side, appointed to once again bring justice to the land.
"Dungeons & Dragons" is a respectable take on the classic good-versus-evil 
theme, despite its constant resemblance to a low-rent version of "Star Wars." 
While a sometimes pleasurable diversion, the writing and aformentioned budget 
restraints bring the end result down several notches. Since director Solomon 
(a long-time "D&D" fan) knew that money would be tight, he should have 
concentrated on making the story and writing original and smart. Alas, his 
script is ridden with cliches and the dialogue comes off unintentionally 
silly. 
Not helping matters are the mediocre performances given by all. Best of the 
lot is most likely Justin Whalin (1991's "Child's Play 3"), as Ridley, as he 
is the center of the movie and equips himself well. He is bland, however, 
particularly in comparison to Marlon Wayans (2000's "Scary Movie"), as his 
sidekick Snails, whose wisecracks aren't nearly as annoying as expected. 
Rounding out the main three players is Zoe McLellan (1997's "Inventing the 
Abbotts"), who may or may not be a good actress; from the evidence presented 
here, I would guess the latter. As the head villain, Jeremy Irons (1998's 
"The Man in the Iron Mask") is outrageously cheesy, overacting and chewing up 
the scenery to such a degree that everyone acting next to him might as well 
not even open their mouths--his yelling and evil laughter often drown out the 
other dialogue. Finally, Thora Birch (1999's "American Beauty") is severely 
wasted as Empress Savina. To go from such a masterful motion picture as 
"American Beauty" down to something as inconsequential as "Dungeons & 
Dragons" (and to not even be particularly that good) is mindboggling. 
Hopefully, Birch got a servicable paycheck for playing what is basically the 
poor-man's Queen Amidala character, played by Natalie Portman, from "Star 
Wars--Episode 1."
With a bigger budget, a stronger screenplay, and generally more accomplished 
actors, "Dungeons & Dragons" might have been a film worth remembering--the 
first notable release of its type since the "Conan" movies. Instead, it 
stands as a near-success with too many holes and problematic sections to be 
able to recommend. Perhaps the best thing that can honestly be said about 
"Dungeons & Dragons" is that it could have been much worse. Now how's that 
for being positive?

_Dungeons_&_Dragons_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Director Courtney Solomon spent the better part of ten years trying to
make his boyhood obsession, the perennially popular role playing game
Dungeons & Dragons, into a feature film, but none of the passion that
fact would entail ends up on screen.  What does show up all too clearly
in _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ is rookie helmer Solomon's lack of experience in
film, let alone with a project of such large, effects-laden scale.  D&D
enthusiasts have been clamoring for a film adaptation since the game came
on the scene 26 years ago, and while I am not a player myself, I am
certain that this sloppy slice of schlock is hardly what the fandom had
in mind.
The setting is a mythical medieval empire, and the 17-year-old Empress
Savina's (Thora Birch) goal of removing the class division between the
magic-practicing Mages and everyone else runs into a snag when the evil
wizard Profion (Jeremy Irons) turns her government advisors against her. 
Exactly how, I don't know.  But it's not so much control over the kingdom
that Profion wants than a magical rod--one that will bring red dragons
under his command.  The Empress possesses a rod that gives her power over
green dragons.  If this makes any sense to you, let me know, because it's
all an incoherent jumble to me.
In any event, a trio of plucky young people proves to be Profion and
henchman Damodar's (Bruce Payne) biggest obstacle in locating the coveted
rod.  They are fledgling young Mage Marina (Zoe McLellan) and the
thievery team of Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans).  True
to their larcenous roots, Ridley and Snails jump into the do-good biz in
hopes of pocketing a large reward, but, of course, the heroic instincts
within ultimately purify their intentions.
Given that the source material is a game, a weak plot is just about
expected (what isn't is just how inscrutable it also is, but that's
another issue entirely), for the emphasis should be on action set pieces.
 As I mentioned, I was never a D&D player, but I do know that navigation
through booby-trapped mazes and dungeons is a big part of the game (one
of the more exciting elements, from what I remember from friends who
played back in junior high).  So it would only follow that _D&D_ the
movie would be packed with such set pieces.  Alas, there's only one, and
a mighty underwhelming one at that, featuring unimaginative traps and
zero tension.  Filling in the rest of the requisite action beats in the
script credited to Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright are half-hearted
swordfights often punctuated with some very chintzy magic effects.
Which leads me to the other half of the title, the dragons.  The final
act certainly has their fair share of them, green and red, all flying
around and battling dragon and human alike.  Never mind that their sudden
arrival in the story is barely (if even that) explained; these creatures
are CGI creations that look every bit like digital FX work.  To top it
off, all the CG work, from the dragons to various animated backdrops to
simple magic dust, is not-so-seamlessly integrated into the live action. 
The only flourish that slightly convinces is a fairly simple ripple
effect used to depict teleportation holes.
Not only is Solomon obviously not able to pull off the technical aspects
of this project, he's also clueless with his cast.  Whalin and McLellan
are embarrassingly amateurish, the latter especially so, with her
invariably stilted line readings.  The insulting role of the buffoonish,
wisecracking African-American sidekick (we all know what ultimately lies
in store for this type of character) brings out the worst broad instincts
in Wayans.  Birch seems embalmed, her Amidala-lite costumes apparently
constricting her throat so that she speaks in a constant monotone.  Worst
of all, however, is the Oscar winner of the lot, Irons; Solomon
apparently thought that since he's such a reputable thespian, Irons
should not simply be given free rein, but no reins at all.  What a
horrendous mistake that turns out to be, for Irons is just one small step
short of foaming at the mouth in every single scene.
The big mistake, however, is making _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ in the first
place.  The reason why video game movies have all failed is that the
element of interactivity that made them so special to begin with is lost.
 Of course, the same idea holds true for a role playing game movie, but
there's an even larger miscalculation at play: the sights and scenarios
imagined during the course of playing such a game will always be more
vivid and exciting than those an FX crew could cook up--especially the
type of low-rent crew that can only be afforded by a neophyte director
with no formal training working with independently-raised overseas money.

Many years ago, my friends and I would meet every
other Saturday afternoon and embark on imaginary
quests.  In our minds, we created and entered a
mythical realm that held treasures waiting to be
discovered, perils waiting to be faced, and magic
spells waiting to be unleashed.  Our group of
adventurers included fighters that eagerly charged
into battle, mages that coruscated the sky with magic
missiles and balls of lightning, clerics that provided
healing powers, and thieves that were useful in
disarming traps and picking locks.  Overseen by an
emcee that thrust us into dangerous situations, armed
with a stack of paper that provided information about
our abilities, and equipped with a myriad of strangely
shaped dice that could spell fortune or disaster, we
giddily lost ourselves for several hours in the
neo-medieval world of Dungeons & Dragons.
Much of the action and skullduggery that could have
only been imagined those Saturday afternoons have been
conjured up adequately in this live-action film based
on the popular role-playing game.  The story tells
about the struggle between young, embattled Empress
Savina (Thora Birch) and the power-mad Profion (Jeremy
Irons), an evil mage who seeks to incite a revolt. 
Savina receives help from some unlikely sources
including two bumbling thieves, an apprentice mage, a
battle axe-wielding dwarf, and a dark-skinned elf. 
They find danger at every turn as they negotiate
dungeons, trapped mazes, and a dragon's lair where
they seek an artifact that can help them defeat
Profion.
The landscape, the various humanoid races, and the
monsters are all nicely envisioned, but the movie
suffers terribly from stilted acting and a screenplay
that sacrifices what could have been a rousing
adventure of might and magic for cartoonish mayhem. 
Jeremy Irons is frequently incomprehensible as the
snarling mage.  Thora Birch lacks passion as the
benevolent leader.  And the others players seem like
they're from various defunct WB television shows. 
They are much too young to be able to succeed in their
tasks, but are obviously cast in order to appeal to a
younger audience.  
With its popularity and built-in fan base, a
live-action film seemed like a no-brainer.  However,
it took 10 long years before a suitable script and the
necessary financing (budgeted at about $40+ million)
could be put together.  And bringing the world of D&D
to life was not easy.  Only recently, the special
effects technology was adequate enough to successfully
capture the enchanted look that an ersatz Paladin like
myself could appreciate.  Indeed, the visuals are
quite impressive, making this film look far more
expensive than its purported price tag.  In its
climactic scene, for example, there is a tremendous
battle that showcases dozens of flying dragons and
spellcasting mages.  Yet while this film seems long
overdue, it also feels like it has arrived too late. 
My dice now sit in the dusty corner of some
seldom-used closet and my character sheets have
yellowed with age.  Only teens, fans of Baldur's Gate,
and Dungeon-heads will find this tolerable.

        You know you're in big trouble when halfway through a movie you ask
yourself, "What would be better?  Sitting through the rest of this
garbage or receiving a scratch to the retina?"  Ultimately, the question
is moot, since both are examples of ocular mayhem.
        The impulse as you sit through Dungeons & Dragons is to close your
eyes, thereby shielding yourself from those atrocious computer-generated
zooming up and down gaudily-colored castles and cloud-capped palaces. 
Unfortunately, the sound design is so brutal with those sharp rings as
swords clash, glitter dust swirls, and magic spells go WHOOSH that sleep
is not a viable option.
        Consider just this small aspect of the film: Why is it that the main
characters are dressed like Tolkein's rangers but sound like The Real
World, some gaudy hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and Star Wars: Episode
I?
        Indeed, it's nearly impossible to look at the young Empress Savina
(Thora Birch, American Beauty) without thinking about Natalie Portman's
headdress.  Say what you will about the George Lucas film, Portman did
manage to appear regal.  Birch, on the other hand, comes off as a
bubble-headed Valley Girl whose glib talk of equality for everyone would
fit comfortably on the stage of a high school beauty contest.
        In our opening tracking shot across the sea, while dragons fly
underfoot, we hear a ponderous voice-over throwing out strange names and
places.  We haven't been introduced to anyone yet, and I defy the viewer
to make sense of it.  What we do get is this: The Mages are attempting
to overthrow the Empire of Izmer, while the commoners struggle for equal
rights.  Profion (former Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons) seeks the
scepter to control the power of the Golden Dragons, but we also learn of
an equally powerful rod which unites the Red Dragons.  Are you with me
so far?  There's a quiz afterwards.
        It's around this time that we meet the two young thieves, Ridley
(Justin Whalin) and his silly black sidekick, Step 'n' Fetchit (Marlon
Wayans, Requiem for a Dream).  Actually, the Wayans character is called
Snails, who will sacrifice anything, even his life if need be, to save
Massah.  Spike Lee would have a field day with Wayans' bug-eyed
performance.  Of course, Wayans is bringing it on himself -- he's
clearly set up as the white man's burden and is handled as such.  His
final scene nails the coffin shut on my case.
        Ridley and Snails sneak into the inner sanctum of a wizard who has some
sort of secret scroll (another prop) that the bad guys are after.  As
the good guys set off on their adventure, they team up with a young
magician (Zoe McLellan) who never actually uses her magic -- she's too
busy waiting for the boys to rescue her.  Since Jeremy Irons only wants
to pick up his paycheck for this film, he sends the sinister Damodar
(Bruce Payne) in hot pursuit.
        Together, the thieves, the young magician, and a few other trusty
sidekicks run through a series of hoops, with the crazy kids wandering
through forests and towns, thieves' mazes, and enemy castles.  To keep
things entertaining, they never let up on their sarcastic repartee,
slapping each other high-fives.  Meanwhile, Snails ponders the immortal
question, "Massah, why do you always get to save the girl while I go
after the dwarf?"  Riddle me that, Batman!
        The sorry excuse for a plot builds up to an elaborate, if
incomprehensible, dragon war.  Buildings are smashed, swords are drawn,
and the sky runs red with blood (actually, computer generated clouds
that might have been swell in Tomb Raider but won't be fooling anyone
here).  Jeremy Irons gets to stand at the top of a tower cackling,
contorting his face, and, ultimately, destroying his career with such
aplomb that I wonder when he'll work in this town again.
        Is there anything good which can be said about Dungeons & Dragons? 
Fans of the role-playing game will be distressed as they see their
beloved world contorted into a travesty.  Those who loved the Saturday
morning cartoon will wonder why the filmmakers didn't simply use that
cute, kid-friendly story as source material.
        Everyone else out there is on their own.  Just pretend this review is a
large iron gate where, written large, are the words Abandon Hope, All Ye
Who Enter Here.
        POSTSCRIPT: There is one good thing I can say about the film, which
perhaps will be of little interest to anyone who never saw the wonderful
British sci-fi show, Doctor Who.  My boyhood hero, Tom Baker, who played
the good doctor throughout the '70s, makes a cameo appearance in D&D as
the Lord of the Elves.  It made me feel good to know that he is still
getting work.

Okay, I admit it. As a critic, I'm supposed to approach any movie 
objectively, but that isn't always the case. There are some films I'm just 
predisposed to liking -- anything starring Jimmy Stewart, for example.
"Dungeons & Dragons" falls into this category. I've been a participant in 
the role-playing game for thirteen years, and have anticipated its 
big-screen treatment for some time. To further whet my appetite, the film 
features a cameo by one of my favourite actors (Tom Baker, the 
curly-haired Time Lord with the immense scarf on the BBC's "Doctor Who"). 
And this is on top of boasting two traditionally excellent actors in 
Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch.
First, let's be clear: "Dungeons & Dragons" isn't really "based on" the 
role-playing game. That's because there's not a lot of source material: 
D&D, the game, is a set of mechanics sparsely peppered with vague 
background. You could just as easily create a movie based on "Monopoly" or 
"Yahtzee". The basic idea is to take the rules set down in the D&D game 
and apply them to a scenario invented by the players themselves.
The world depicted in "Dungeons & Dragons", the movie, is therefore 
entirely an invention of producer/director Courtney Solomon and writers 
Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright. At best, "Dungeons & Dragons" 
adheres to the rules laid down in the game, and then only loosely.
The Empire of Izmer is on the brink of civil war. Socially-conscious 
young Empress Savina (Birch) is locked in a struggle with the ruling 
Council of Mages, led by Profion (Irons). Profion desires power for 
himself, but Savina wields an enchanted staff which allows her to control 
mighty gold dragons. Through his brutish underling Damodar (Bruce Payne), 
Profion learns of another magical staff which would permit him to command 
red dragons. However, the roguish Ridley (Justin Whalin) uncovers 
Profion's plot, and sets out on a quest to find the staff first.
Ridley quickly accumulates a party of allies, including his thieving 
partner Snails (Marlon Wayans), apprentice magic-user Norda (Zoe 
McLellan), elven tracker Marrina (Kristen Wilson) and gluttonous dwarf 
Elwood (Lee Arenberg). (The name Elwood comes from the press material -- 
if the dwarf is ever actually named onscreen, I didn't hear it.) The 
amusing thing is that, with the exception of Snails, Ridley's companions 
accomplish nothing beyond serving as convenient hostages for the bad 
guys. One amusing scene, in which they confront Profion one after the 
other only to each be instantly despatched by the villain, tells the whole 
story.
His adventuring band assembled, Ridley endures a series of dungeons and 
mazes, eventually leading to the recovery of the fabled staff. With the 
dungeons dispensed with, what comes next but -- you guessed it -- the 
dragons. Lots of them. Apparently, someone didn't quite realise that 
"Dungeons & Dragons" is just a cute, alliterative name for the game, not 
its complete description.
Solomon allegedly spent a decade crafting the storyline for this film, but 
it scarcely shows. Frankly, I've seen better D&D adventures put together 
on the spur of the moment at the start of a gaming session. At its best, 
D&D allows participants' imaginations to soar. Solomon, on the other hand, 
has kept his story firmly rooted in the most laboured cliches of the genre 
-- everything from sliding walls to those boobytrapped floors where you 
have to step on just the right stones to make it across. It's telling that 
one of the movie's seemingly more interesting scenes, in which Ridley and 
Norda actually enter a magic map and confront the spirit dwelling within, 
is reported purely through dialogue.
The acting in "Dungeons & Dragons" is almost universally abysmal. Whalin 
(who was the second, far duller Jimmy Olsen in the "Lois & Clark" TV 
series) and McLellan have clearly been cast purely for their all-American 
good looks; their overacting is embarrassing to behold. Only Irons 
surpasses them in this regard, chewing the scenery with gusto literally 
every time he appears. Birch shows none of the prowess she demonstrated in 
"American Beauty" -- she utters lines of dialogue as though her mouth was 
filled with marbles, and she lives up to her surname for wooden acting. 
Payne apparently spends the entire movie under the misapprehension that 
talking in a raspy voice makes him sound menacing and not at all like a 
guy in need of some Vicks Vapo-Rub; he inexplicably wears silver lipstick 
throughout, to boot. Virtually the only reasonable acting is offered by 
Wayans, but this is mitigated by the fact that his role as the cowardly, 
covetous Snails verges on being a racist stereotype.
None of them are helped out by the clumsy, cheesy script concocted by 
Lilien and Cartwright. As bad as the delivery might be, in many cases the 
actual dialogue is even worse. Consider this hair-curling exchange. 
Profion: "I shall invent a NEW DESTINY of PAIN for you... and NEW SENSES 
with which to FEEL IT!" Ridley: "Not if I kill you first!" (Truly, the 
snappy comeback is a lost art.) And everything leads up to an ending which 
tries to be touching and inspiring, but only manages to be sappy and 
confused.
Visually, "Dungeons & Dragons" is respectable, with scenes of dragons in 
combat above Izmer looking particularly good (albeit clearly 
computer-generated). However, it does appear that the production was 
running low on funds for some sequences -- for instance, count the number 
of times Ridley and friends seem to pass the exact same copse of trees. 
(Then again, maybe they accidentally let Irons loose on that particular 
set.)
Otherwise, about the only thing "Dungeons & Dragons" has going for it is 
that it at least falls into the category of films so bad they're funny. 
It's difficult to be bored sitting through this one when you're spending
the whole time laughing at it (at it, mind you, not with it). If ever 
there was a compelling reason to revive the late, lamented "Mystery 
Science Theater 3000", "Dungeons & Dragons" is it.
