     All right, admit it: The credits "Written and directed by Sofia
Coppola" don't exactly set the heart racing in anticipation of artistic
triumph. Your defining image of Sofia Coppola probably involves her
single-handedly making THE GODFATHER PART III painful to watch. Or maybe
you go back farther, to her script credit on the lifeless "Life With Zoe" 
segment of NEW YORK STORIES.  If so, then consider this (perhaps faint) 
praise for THE VIRGIN SUICIDES: Sofia shows more visual flair in her
directorial debut than Papa Francis has managed to show in the last 20
years or so.
      If only she had managed a bit more story sense. Based on Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is the story of the five Lisbon
sisters -- Bonnie (Chelsea Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Mary (A. J. Cook),
Therese (Leslie Hayman) and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall) -- children of
strictly religious parents (Kathleen Turner and James Woods) in mid-1970s
Michigan. The girls inspire fascination in their male peers, but the
fascination grows even more intense when the youngest girl, 13-year-old
Cecilia, throws herself from a second floor window onto an iron fence
spike. The family retreats even more after the incident, but that doesn't
stop the flirtatious Lux from trying to find some semblance of a normal
adolescence -- including deceiving her parents.
     Stylistically, Coppola does plenty to keep the film interesting. 
There are few gimmicks she's unwilling to employ: slow-motion, split
screens, odd angles. She also crafts one extremely effective sequence at a
homecoming dance that captures every nuance of adolescent romantic
fumbling. Her approach shows Coppola understands that THE VIRGIN SUICIDES
is not a simple narrative, but a flashback remembrance of pubescent
fantasy. The girls are representations of idealized visions by the story's
collective male narrator (given voice by Giovanni Ribisi), not
fully-realized characters -- and that's fine. THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is
effective at creating a coming-of-age dreamscape where the tranquility of
suburbia collides with the inherent turbulence of youth.
     Sounds good on paper, doesn't it? It's true that Coppola gives THE
VIRGIN SUICIDES just the right atmosphere, but she never manages to latch
onto anything that would give the story focus or momentum. Her biggest
mistake is making arbitrary use of the novel's structure as a remembrance
told from a distance of many years, much of it through imperfectly 
recalled interviews with key players. In one scene she shows an adult Trip
Fontaine (Michael Par) describing his fling as a teenager (Josh Hartnett) 
with Lux. It's a great scene -- effectively demonstrating the lasting
effect the Lisbon girls had on those around them -- but it also serves to
show how much better the film would have been with more moments like it. 
The tale's young male observers also disappear for long stretches,
allowing the film to drift into trite suburban family drama. On the page,
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES was hypnotic and mysterious; on the screen, it's a
collection of eye-catching individual moments that too rarely coalesce
into something more profound.
     In a cinematic climate where films about adolescents usually bear
little resemblance to reality, it's refreshing to find a film-maker
interested in capturing the tangled emotions of that time. Sofia Coppola
is working from a fundamentally strong source, and she has put together a
cast and crew that make THE VIRGIN SUICIDES worth watching (and worth
listening to, with its sublimely kitschy soundtrack of period tunes by
ELO, Styx and Heart). When it latches on to those moments of wonder at the
emerging adulthood of the opposite sex -- one boy's wide-eyed discovery of
feminine hygiene products in the Lisbon bathroom, for instance -- it's
dead on target. Unfortunately, there's also too much of the mundane in
Coppola's adaptation. If she develops as much instinct for storytelling as
she does for directing, Sofia Coppola could be a film-maker to watch
for. And there's a prospect I'll bet you never expected.

         In the same way the muses inspired the artists of ancient
Greece, the five Lisbon sisters haunt the dreams of the adolescent boys
of Grosse Pointe in "The Virgin Suicides," director Sofia Coppola's
lyrical, chilling adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about sexual
repression and promiscuity in the 1970s. Like those muses, the Lisbons
float out of reach of mere mortals and when they briefly descend to
Earth, they leave broken hearts and poetry in their wake.
 Coppola follows the book almost to the letter, using dialogue
sparingly and letting a narration by Giovanni Ribisi carry her film to
its tragic conclusion. But "Virgin Suicides" cloaks the story in layers
of mystery and fantastic imagery, tantalizing its viewers as easily as
the wise-beyond-her-years Lux (Kirsten Dunst) commands the attention of
every young man who crosses her path. No detail is too minor to escape
Coppola's attention: The thump of a needle hitting a record, the
tickling of a clock and the drip from a leaking roof are just as
important in setting the scene here as the Styx anthems, peasant skirts
and shaggy haircuts. Instead of laughing at 1975, Coppola weaves a
sensuous suburban myth that seduces you completely.
 "Suicides" is a work of fiction, although, like Eugenides'
prose, it's so believable you half-expect to find a "based on a true
story" label in its credits. The Lisbons are a quietly dysfunctional
family headed up by a do-nothing dad (an amazingly low-key and effective
James Woods) and a religious-fanatic mom (Kathleen Turner) who is so
obsessed with keeping her daughters hidden from the evils of society,
she inadvertently smothers them. Lux, the middle child, is the only one
who escapes her mother's grasp and when she does, she recklessly
searches for some kind of acceptance from the outside world.
 With a come-hither smile and relaxed body language, Dunst
magically and vibrantly brings Lux to life. Watching this hopelessly
confused girl give herself up first to a dopey jock named Trip (Josh
Hartnett), then to a parade of anonymous lovers, results in the saddest
and most heart-wrenching sex scenes since Jennifer Jason Leigh's
similarly misguided character lost her virginity in "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."
 Coppola's screenplay doesn't throw out the humor of the novel
either. Far from the little sophisticates we've gotten used to seeing in
teen comedies such as "Down To You" and "Drive Me Crazy," the characters
here are just as awkward and fumbling as most high-schoolers. Since they
can't express their feelings in their own words, the boys call the
Lisbons up and play records over the phone for them. Songs such as
Carole King's "So Far Away" and the Bee Gees' "Run To Me" take on
enormous poignancy as they become the lifeline that keeps the girls
anchored to the outside world.
 Even Trip, perceived by all as a dreamy stud, is overwhelmed
when confronted by the love-hungry Lux. It's easy to see why: Dunst,
perhaps best-remembered as the eerily wise little blood-drinker in
"Interview With the Vampire," is now outfitted with a combination of sex
appeal and vulnerability reminiscent of what we saw when the then
teen-aged Uma Thurman slithered through "Henry and June" and "Dangerous
Liaisons." No wonder Mama Lisbon is so worried about keeping her at
home.
 The casting of former glamor girl Turner as the plump, pristine
matriarch works exceptionally well. Behind her facade of anxiety you can
glimpse the teasing siren she once was and see that somewhere along the
way Mrs. Lisbon buried her past under heaps of shame and
self-righteousness.
 Her daughters refuse to go down that path, however, and instead
find a way to remain forever young and free from their mother's
influence. What's worse, Coppola asks, having children who don't always
behave as we'd like them to, or not having children at all? James

Hall, Chelse Swain, A.J. Cook, Leslie Hayman, Michael Pare, Danny

Based on a novel by: Jeffrey Eugenides

Running Time: 91 minutes 
Suicide is pointless, everyone should know that.  So what's this movie
like?  You guessed it... pointless. 
The Virgin Suicides focuses on the lives of the five Lisbon sisters,
from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them. 
When the youngest Lisbon sister commits suicide, it sets in motion a
series of events that will change the lives of many people forever. 
That's what the press materials for the film probably say.  Now here's
what I say: The Virgin Suicides is a huge waste of time.  Boring, arty,
pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as... well as committing
suicide.  The movie lost me early on, immediately following the scene
where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window. 
The girl's father (James Woods) holds her lifeless body in his arms as
their horrified family looks on.  Then, as the scene ends, the lawn
sprinklers come on.  Is that a joke?  Is that supposed to be amusing in
some way?  From then on, the movie failed to draw me back in. 
Performances are the only saving grace of The Virgin Suicides.  Woods
plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came
onscreen, but the performance of Kirsten Dunst as the next youngest
daughter Lux is worth mentioning as well.  Dunst has the potential to be
a big star, if she chooses her projects well.  And while this film is
awful, she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed.  There are
also a few cameos in the film here and there, which only frustrate the
audience as they leave you wanting more.  As a result, they all seem
rather pointless (although there's a brief role given to Michael Pare
from Eddie and the Cruisers which turns out to be his best role since...
well since Eddie and the Cruisers). 
Perhaps The Virgin Suicides would have worked had the story not been
told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the
main characters.  We never get any significant insight into the girls
and why they might be feeling what they're feeling.  All we really know
is that Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) is strict and keeps them on a
short leash.  What mother doesn't?  It's certainly no reason to commit
suicide. 
With The Godfather Part III, Sofia Coppola proved that she had no
business being in front of the camera.  With The Virgin Suicides, she
proves she has no business behind it either.  Having family connections
doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies.  So attention film
directors... stop letting your daughters pout their way into the
industry.  Just because they share your DNA doesn't mean they share your
talent.  [R]

Okay, so it's been years since movie critics ripped into the Coppola clan
for turning nepotism into a hobby, and by most accounts, ruining the third
Godfather film with the obvious parental choice of daughter Sofia as one of
the main leads, by lead Coppola member, writer/director Francis Ford. Of
course, that's all in the past now, and with Sofia making her directorial
debut with this film, we're all just glad that she's doing it all on her
own. What's that you say? Oops, sorry, the production company behind this
movie is actually owned by her daddy. Oh well, enough about the backdoor
shenanigans, let's talk about the movie...
PLOT:
Five very pretty sisters living under the roof of one really strict mom and
one really wussed-out dad, attempt to live normal lives among the gaggle of
young boys straddled around their ankles, asking for dates.
CRITIQUE:
In one word: boring. In two words: meaningless and boring. And in as many
words as I could come up with: this movie starts off real slow, sets an
intriguing mood, gets semi-interesting when the character of Trip Fontaine
enters the picture, but ultimately draws to a predictable and surprisingly
uninteresting close. I spent much of this film wondering what the heck it
was all about, and when the film finally concluded on that oh-so popular
open-ended "you figure it out" vibe, I was left caring even less about any
of its preceding moments. Incidentally, my thoughts as to the lingering
question of "why"-uhm, cause the parents were cold and unreasonable, that's
why! What a mystery. Not that any of the characters were developed enough to
begin with, most of the boys were just young and horny, all five of the
sisters were aloof and giddy (save for one), and the parents were just
unreasonably strict for unknown reasons (religion I suppose, but why so
strict?). Now whether or not the hidden message in this film had to do with
the "loss of innocence" or the "generation gap", God knows. In the end, all
the film managed to successfully bring up was more questions than answers.
But I suppose there is a certain type of audience for esoteric films of this
sort. Those who line the art-house circuit usually enjoy analyzing the depth
of such films, which on the whole, generate little to no entertainment value
for the rest of us.
Of course, I don't like to dismiss films completely due to their lack of one
or two elements, especially when other elements of the film do hit the mark.
In this movie, the actors were all spot-on, with special kudos going out to
the man with the big...IQ, James Woods, as the nerdy math teacher. Whatta
chump. He was excellent in this film. On the kids' side, Kirsten Dunst
certainly played the ideal hard-to-get teen queen to a tee, while Josh
Hartnett showed that he is more than just a pretty face (and abs...wow!). I
also commend Ms. Coppola on her distinct style, obvious to anyone who enjoys
the challenge of a filmmaker's eye, and the soundtrack, which scored heavy
points, with a special salute of the thumb going out to the sequence
featuring the "Magic Man" song and Hartnett. Well done. But other than that,
the film just bored me stupid. Very few laughs, even less memorable scenes,
and definitely not an "entertainment" film, by any stretch of the
imagination. I suppose that if you're the type of person who enjoys watching
films which don't say much, leave much to ponder afterwards, and create an
authentic enough mood, then this film might just be for you. For anyone
else, looking for an interesting story, an absorbing message or even just a
simple night of entertainment at the movies, I suggest that you skip this
offspring and check out the darkly comedic high school classic HEATHERS,
instead.
PS: I just read Roger Ebert's review of this film (which he loved
incidentally) and noticed how he used a quote from Tolstoy to make a point.
The quote itself is unimportant, but important is to point out that people
who generally go around quoting Tolstoy, are more than likely the type of
people who will enjoy this flick. Of course, that's only my cheezy little
observation, folks : )
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actor Giovanni Ribisi, who does not act in this film, is nevertheless the
voice of the narrator.
Actor Danny DeVito, who acted under the guise of Sofia's dad Francis Ford in
THE RAINMAKER a few years ago, makes a cameo appearance in this film as a
psychiatrist.
This film was originally titled THE LISBON SISTERS.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Athan Bezaitis.

 THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a dark comedy that embodies some twisted views
on suburban family life and the true lack innocence of adolescence.
First-time writer and director Sofia Coppola, daughter of GODFATHER
creator Francis Ford Coppola, proves to us that she's not really an
actress (see THE GODFATHER, PART III), but that she does have the family
knack for provocative movie directing.  The movie is based upon Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, The Virgin Suicides, a detective story about five
sisters who mysteriously commit suicide and the investigation by four
neighborhood boys who had fallen in love with them.  Coppola, however,
transforms the movie into her own allegory of five adolescent girls who
suffer from ruthlessly suppressed lives, their desperate plea for
self-expression, and the tragedy that besets their wretched existence.
Set in the mid-seventies, the plot follows the Lisbon family, with James
Woods, a physics teacher at the local high school, as the scatter
brained father, and Kathleen Turner as the uncommonly strict mother.
Their five daughters are beautiful, naturally blonde, and the desire of
every boy in the neighborhood.  When the youngest, Cecilia, mysteriously
attempts suicide, psychiatrist Danny DeVito recommends that she be
allowed to interact more socially, especially with boys.  So the Lisbon
girls are introduced to the boys of the neighborhood, who have already
been watching the girls from afar through half-opened window shades,
binoculars, and telescopes.  At a party in Cecilia's honor, the boys
witness a tragedy that shocks them out of their wits.  As a result, the
Lisbons fall into a deep suppression shutting out the rest of the world
by retreating into their own inner sanctum.  It appears they will never
recover until Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the high school heartthrob,
pursues the unattainable Lux (Kirsten Dunst).  He attempts to ask her to
the prom, but the only way her mother will allow him to take Lux is if
all the girls go together.  For the first time, the girls will venture
out of the home to interact socially in an environment other than
school.
The movie begins as a lighthearted comedy with some great cameos from
the likes of DeVito and town priest Scott Glenn (BACKDRAFT).  The tone,
however, turns somber once the children are exposed to the worst of
their suppression.  Kathleen Turner as mom reverts to her SERIAL MOM
days, making the kids burn their rock records and even withdrawing them
from school.  Reminiscent of 1987's FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, the children
are forced to fantasize through travel guides, imagining a different
life in faraway lands. With every avenue of self-expression cut off, the
girls suffocate in their misery and cry out for help to the boys in the
neighborhood.
The film, with its large ensemble cast, is well acted, and director
Coppola gets the best out of old pros Woods and Turner, while at the
same time coaxing solid performances out of her young cast, especially
Dunst and Hartnett.  On the flip side, what the film lacks is solid
character development.  We don't learn enough about any of the
neighborhood boys, or the strict Lisbon parents, or the mysterious Trip
Fontaine.  Constantly floating from one sequence of events to the next,
I was left with too many unanswered questions as to whether the story
was a mystery about what drove the girls off the edge, or how the
neighborhood boys became so fascinated with them.  Either way, it takes
away some of the film's appeal with no "real" characters to latch on to
in order to help you through such a bizarre and fantastic situation.
Despite its flaws, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a success.  It's an eerie look
at life with a sick twist of fate for five beautiful sisters with the
world as their oyster.  With this film, Sofia Coppola will strike a
presence for herself on the Hollywood scene -- no longer to be known for
her infamous role as Michael Corleone's daughter.  Ford Coppola was
criticized for casting Sofia in that role, but now he will be praised
for helping to produce his daughter's beautiful film.

The provocative title "Virgin Suicides" connotes a rough edgy film shaded
with dark humor and graphic violence - perhaps even sporting a grainy 16mm
touch and feel to the projection on screen. But in reality, "Virgin
Suicides" plays out more like the "growing up" stories of "Liberty Heights"
or "October Sky" as it utilizes the suicides of five beautiful, blonde, teen
sisters as the story's vehicle.
Rewinding to the 1970's, this suburban high school tale aspires to recreate
the mystery, magic and agony of teendom.
Doctor to patient, "What are you doing here? You're not even old enough to
know how bad life can get."
Suicidal teen, "Obviously doctor, you've never been a 13 year old girl."
Narrator Giovani Ribisi recounts the events that lead up to the final
suicides, while simultaneously introducing us to the Lisbon sisters, his
group of neighborhood boys, and the intersection thereof. Though the
filmmakers' constantly seem to be telling this tale as some sort of
cathartic therapy toward understanding the suicides and therefore, I don't
know, comprehending life itself a little better; it unfortunately seems more
of an insincere excuse to relate a rather interesting story. In fact, it
isn't necessary that Ribisi needs to or even cares to know the WHY's. The
fact is, the story itself is compelling enough. In this way, it's not unlike
a bystander ogling a car-wreck for the inexplicable guttural attraction,
then trying to excuse his interest as purely investigatory.
But that's just what I saw, here's what the director had to say, "It's about
mortality and obsession and love. It isn't about romanticizing suicide. I
never saw the Lisbon sisters or their acts as real and I don't think they
were intended to be. The Lisbons are the figments of memory, these lovely
mythical creatures of the imagination who are more beautiful than reality
can ever be, so of course they cannot last."
Still, this is my review. The reasons for the suicides seem rather strongly
implied if not plainly obvious. Personally, I'd rather have had them left
mysterious. But as long as they weren't, any pursuit to their understanding
by Ribisi seems insulting. A focus from the domineeringly oppressive
parents' perspective, may have been a curious direction, though that would
have been another project all together. James Woods is awesome, albeit a
minor character, as the submissively bliss math teacher father; while
Kathleen Turner (mom) rules the house with an iron-gate fist.
In the end, this is not really the edgy graphic picture you'd expect. It's a
coming of age tale about boys and girls that never quite comes of age
itself, but still makes an interesting story. Ribisi's narration generalizes
the difference between the sexes, "We know that they knew everything about
us, but we couldn't fathom them at all."
Debuting director Soffie Coppla (daughter of Francis Ford) shows great
talent in portraing the moments. A family at home watching nature TV with
the handsome young male guest, a bare foot on the coffee table, the uneasy
parents. But this particular film, though compelling (even humorous) at
times, doesn't quite fill out in the end.

VIRGIN SUICIDES (director/writer: Sofia Coppola; screenwriter: based on
the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides; cinematographer: Edward Lachman; editor:
James Lyons/Melissa Kent; cast: James Woods (Mr. Lisbon), Kathleen
Turner  (Mrs. Lisbon), Kirsten Dunst (Lux Lisbon), Hanna Hall (Cecilia
Lisbon), Chelse Swain (Bonnie Lisbon), A. J. Cook (Mary Lisbon), Leslie
Hayman (Therese Lisbon), Danny DeVito (Dr. Horniker), Josh Hartnett

Fontaine '97); Runtime: 97; Paramount Classics; 1999)
An artistically moody puzzler built around the mystery of five sisters
in a wealthy small Michigan suburban town who committed suicide twenty
five years ago (the story takes place in the 1970s, as evidenced by the
background music of Styx and Electric Light Orchestra). The film is
narrated offscreen by Giovanni Ribisi, as an adult looking back at that
time with all the physical evidence the locals collected about the
girls. The recollections of the girls is by their boy classmates, the
ones who lusted after their dream girls and their perceptions are
admittedly drawn from their limited experiences with the girls and from
anything they found in the girls's house afterwards, such as Cecilia's
diary and photos of the girls. It is richly adapted from a Jeffrey
Eugenides novel by director Sofia Coppola.
The film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family
and community. It dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive
girls's smiling faces, leaving one with a lingering feeling of
helplessness about their situation. Adolescence is scrutinized by Sofia
Coppola in a cinematically crafted manner, finely inspired by what we
think we remember about that age when looking back at it, with the
implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than
the other way around. The boys, except for one, are insecure and clumsy
around the girls.
Edward Lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it, as he seems
to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy,
which complements a story that can't be completely put together because
we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did. All we
are left with are some clues to what set the tragedy off and our mind
associations take over as we are left trying to rationalize what we
can't understand.
The first Lisbon girl to go the suicide route was the lovely but unhappy
youngest one, the 13-year-old, Cecilia (Hanna Hall), who first attempts
suicide by jumping off her house roof onto a spiked fence but fails, and
is sent to a shrink (Danny DeVito) for observation. To cheer her up, her
very strict Catholic mother (Kathleen Turner) throws her a party in the
house. At some point during the party, Cecilia retreats upstairs and
succeeds in slitting her wrists.
The distraught father (James Woods), a math teacher in the high school,
is viewed as a decent but unassertive weakling. He deals with the
tragedy afterwards by watching a baseball game, unable to talk with the
girls or the priest who came by to comfort the family.
With the girls back in school, the attractive and sexually inviting Lux
(Kirsten Dunst) has the school's lady man, the handsome guy who walks
with a swagger, Trip (Josh Hartnett), go wild over her. Their romance is
hampered by Mrs. Lisbon not allowing her daughters to go out on dates
alone. But Trip comes up with a plan so that all the girls can have
dates with his friends and attend the high school homecoming dance
together, where Mr. Lisbon will be the chaperone. The promise is made to
return before curfew, but Trip and Lux get carried away with their
passion for each other and make it on the football field, thereby
breaking the curfew. But Trip leaves her alone in the field and will
never see her again after that most perfect night, as he is now
interviewed about her as an adult and says he liked her, she was his
dream girl, and can't explain why he left her.
Mrs. Lisbon goes overboard on the punishment and the girls are
indefinitely grounded from all activities and forced to remain home. The
emasculated father is overwhelmed by all the women around him and
retreats from the crisis he is facing at home, by saying nothing to his
wife about the vindictive punishment dished out.
Within a year of the youngest Lisbon's death, the other four follow suit
after sneaking out for a car ride into the early morning hours with the
high school boys. The 15-year-old Bonnie (Chelse Swain), hangs herself;
the 16-year-old Mary (A. J. Cook) sticks her head in the oven; the
17-year-old Therese (Leslie Hayman) does it by sleeping pills, and the
narrator tells us the last one to go was the 14-year-old Lux, who
handled her confinement by sneaking boys on the house roof for random
sex, as viewed by the neighborhood boys with their expensive telescope.
Despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach
the director used, I still found that this film wasn't talking to me. I
felt I was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has
the possibility to pop up some day on the TV news as one of those
bizarre events that just happen without cause, but the story itself went
no deeper than how the TV news would cover it. The exploration of the
teens in their growing pains, their ordinary wants, and even in their
grandeur, left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale, wondering
how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them, why they were
symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of
their house was, where I could at least see the disease in the tree's
yellow leaves. As for the girls, aside from their horribly repressed,
overbearing mother, Where was the monster lurking in them that made them
feel so despondent? I don't know how much of their futility I could see,
as the more I thought about them, the more they seemed like ghosts than
real people, and they all started looking like each other, so I couldn't
distinguish one from the other, except for Lux, who for some reason in
all her boldness and sexuality, couldn't find the strength to live.
Which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a
complete story. If I tried to know more about the girls, I would only
become like the shrink, giving off pat answers to something that was
supposed to remain a mystery. I don't know if this is a good or a bad
way for a film to leave the viewer, but I do know I felt something
profound was missing here, as the film was more revealing about the boys
and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what
they were really like. This seemed misplaced storytelling, since the
girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward
adolescent tale was. What I got out of the story was a peak at life in
the suburbs and about awkward adolescent boys only looking at the girls
through what they fantasized about them. What saves this film, is the
innovative way the director filmed the story, covering up the fluff to
make the story look deeper than it was.

The challenges of adolescence is a topic that has been frequently
explored. It is a universal theme that practically all viewers can
identify with. This film explores this topic with the allegorical
story of a troubled family.
The film is set in a middle class Michigan neighborhood of the 1970's.
A narrator (voice of Giovanni Ribisi) introduces the story beginning
with the suicide attempt by the youngest of five daughters of the
Lisbon family. The narrator is recounting the story from his past,
since he was a member of a group of boys who knew and liked the girls.
A foreboding tone of impending doom is set immediately, and the
details slowly unfold. The girls are attractive, cheerful, and
seemingly well-adjusted, so no one understands how they came to their
terrible fate. Although their social activities were restricted by
their parents, particularly their devoutly religious mother, their
family never outwardly appeared exceptionally draconian or
dysfunctional.
By setting the story in the 1970's and displaying the pop culture of
the era, the film uses nostalgia to evoke a feeling of remembrance,
but this is not the primary focus of the story. The film has a cogent,
if oblique, plot that it develops. From the film's title, the
narrator's introduction, and the symbolism of the opening scene where
municipal workers mark the Lisbon's tree for removal (to control a
Dutch Elm Disease epidemic), the eventual result is clear.
What differentiates this story from typical teenage angst stories is
the fact that the source of the conflict is not part of the plot. The
perspective is from the outside, as the narrator is merely an observer
of the events. The narrator states that the events of their
adolescence have lingered into their adulthood, and they habitually
reflect this one troubling dimension of their remembered past. The
point being made is that among the halcyon days of youth, there are
problems that may not always be tangible. It is not with morbid
perversity that the tragic events are examined, but rather as a symbol
of part of the pain of growing up.
All aspects of the film are executed well. The story, based on a novel
written by Jeffrey Eugenides, provides a strong foundation. Director
Sofia Coppola skillfully focuses the scope of the film to its
essential elements. The film uses nostalgia for a past decade without
becoming a slave to this dimension. The acting is uniformly
proficient. All the roles of the adolescents are believable, and the
performances of James Woods and Kathleen Turner as the Lisbon parents
required subtlety, as their involvement in their daughters' torment
are unclear.
Highly recommended. This is a highly mood-oriented film whose story
does not attempt to raise questions and answer them. It is a well
crafted exploration of the remembrance of past tragedies and
mysteries. Although it has some light-hearted moments, the film is
essentially quite dark and brooding. It is a success because it keeps
esoteric perspective, and manages to communicate an understandable,
yet murky, story.

         In the same way the muses inspired the artists of ancient
Greece, the five Lisbon sisters haunt the dreams of the adolescent boys
of Grosse Pointe in "The Virgin Suicides," director Sofia Coppola's
lyrical, chilling adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about sexual
repression and promiscuity in the 1970s. Like those muses, the Lisbons
float out of reach of mere mortals and when they briefly descend to
Earth, they leave broken hearts and poetry in their wake.
 Coppola follows the book almost to the letter, using dialogue
sparingly and letting a narration by Giovanni Ribisi carry her film to
its tragic conclusion. But "Virgin Suicides" cloaks the story in layers
of mystery and fantastic imagery, tantalizing its viewers as easily as
the wise-beyond-her-years Lux (Kirsten Dunst) commands the attention of
every young man who crosses her path. No detail is too minor to escape
Coppola's attention: The thump of a needle hitting a record, the ticking
of a clock and the drip from a leaking roof are just as important in
setting the scene here as the Styx anthems, peasant skirts and shaggy
haircuts. Instead of laughing at 1975, Coppola weaves a sensuous
suburban myth that seduces you completely.
 "Suicides" is a work of fiction, although, like Eugenides'
prose, it's so believable you half-expect to find a "based on a true
story" label in its credits. The Lisbons are a quietly dysfunctional
family headed up by a do-nothing dad (an amazingly low-key and effective
James Woods) and a religious-fanatic mom (Kathleen Turner) who is so
obsessed with keeping her daughters hidden from the evils of society,
she inadvertently smothers them. Lux, the middle child, is the only one
who escapes her mother's grasp and when she does, she recklessly
searches for some kind of acceptance from the outside world.
 With a come-hither smile and relaxed body language, Dunst
magically and vibrantly brings Lux to life. Watching this hopelessly
confused girl give herself up first to a dopey jock named Trip (Josh
Hartnett), then to a parade of anonymous lovers, results in the saddest
and most heart-wrenching sex scenes since Jennifer Jason Leigh's
similarly misguided character lost her virginity in "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."
 Coppola's screenplay doesn't throw out the humor of the novel
either. Far from the little sophisticates we've gotten used to seeing in
teen comedies such as "Down To You" and "Drive Me Crazy," the characters
here are just as awkward and fumbling as most high-schoolers. Since they
can't express their feelings in their own words, the boys call the
Lisbons up and play records over the phone for them. Songs such as
Carole King's "So Far Away" and the Bee Gees' "Run To Me" take on
enormous poignancy as they become the lifeline that keeps the girls
anchored to the outside world.
 Even Trip, perceived by all as a dreamy stud, is overwhelmed
when confronted by the love-hungry Lux. It's easy to see why: Dunst,
perhaps best-remembered as the eerily wise little blood-drinker in
"Interview With the Vampire," is now outfitted with a combination of sex
appeal and vulnerability reminiscent of what we saw when the then
teen-aged Uma Thurman slithered through "Henry and June" and "Dangerous
Liaisons." No wonder Mama Lisbon is so worried about keeping her at
home.
 The casting of former glamor girl Turner as the plump, pristine
matriarch works exceptionally well. Behind her facade of anxiety you can
glimpse the teasing siren she once was and see that somewhere along the
way Mrs. Lisbon buried her past under heaps of shame and
self-righteousness.
 Her daughters refuse to go down that path, however, and instead
find a way to remain forever young and free from their mother's
influence. What's worse, Coppola asks, having children who don't always
behave as we'd like them to, or not having children at all? James

I don't think I have heard a more blunt title in ages but for the most blunt summary of a film's content, you can't do better than "The Virgin Suicides." This is Sofia Coppola's brilliant debut film, a searing, intelligent drama of innocence destroyed by the overprotective ruling hand of parents. 
The film opens with the title filling the screen from every corner, as if it was scribbled by overzealous teenage girls. Then the film gradually reveals one particular family, the Lisbons, five luscious-looking Catholic girls living in Michigan during the 1970's. The overprotective parents include the nerdy-looking father, a math teacher (James Woods), and the domineering, stuffy mother (a largely unrecognizable Kathleen Turner). Kirsten Dunst (in perhaps the best role of her career) plays the main Lisbon girl, Lux, whom every adolescent male pines for, including those who live in the neighborhood. These girls seem perfect but everything is on the surface - they are like Barbie Dolls with masks to hide the real problems. At the beginning of the film, a thirteen-year-old Lisbon girl (Hanna Hall) fails a suicide attempt, and then successfully makes another attempt. Nobody knows why, and the parents seem unaffected, as if it was a temporary setback. The father keeps thinking he s!
!
ees his dead daughter, and so do the other girls. But the question is: why did she kill herself? Could it happen to the others?
The main focus in "The Virgin Suicides" is Lux, and she is pursued by Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), a cool dude, for no better description, who is pined for by all the girls for his smoothness and seductive quality - he is a like a young Don Juan. Lux avoids him but his charm eventually gets to her, to the point where she is asked to the prom as are all her sisters (they all end up wearing the same dress). Coppola also makes good use of songs by ELO and others to accentuate the mood, and the prom scenes are especially good at evoking a constrained innocence that is likely to be broken any time soon. 
The prom is the central climax of the film where everything goes downhill. The mother gets so fed up with Lux's disappearance after the prom that she keeps everyone locked up in the house, confined by Lux's unconstrained behavior. Week after week, the girls are kept inside, restricted from ever leaving the house except to pick up the mail. The father seems to go slightly insane, resorting to talking to the plants at school. The mother throws out all rock n' roll records and anything else that might corrupt the girls' innocence. 
"The Virgin Suicides" basically gives away what will happen to the girls - it is even foretold in the film's opening voice-over, narrated by an older Trip played by Michael Pare. There are no easy answers or conventional explanations to their suicides, but we can only surmise by the strange behavioral interaction between the girls and the parents (communication is notably absent). The beauty is that Coppola captures the essence of adolescence, and shows how fragile the Lisbon girls were within their confinement. They were easily corruptible, but were incapable of dealing with emotional pain and duress - instead, they dealt with it through an easy path, an escape, by ending their lives.

The Virgin Suicides is a great film because it asks the audience to interpret 
character interactions and the overall meaning of the film. At its closing, I 
felt like seeing it again to examine the relationships between everyone more 
closely. One would really have to see this movie again in order to fully take 
in its drama and purpose. This gorgeous, dreamy film is definitely worth a 
second viewing.
Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) live in an 
alternate universe that isn't quite explainable. Each of their five 
daughters, Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse 
Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), and Therese (Leslie Hayman) get kept in the house 
under close watch at all times. They cannot go out with anyone, or 
participate in social events outside of school. This of course drives the 
local boys crazy. They often dream of conquering the unconquerable Lisbon 
sisters. Everything changes when Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters at only 
thirteen, attempts suicide. Her psychiatrist (a short appearance from Danny 
Devito) suggests they throw a party, and give her more chances to interact 
with males her own age. The boy's sexuality gets further awakened as they try 
to comprehend and become a part of the girlâs world they get introduced to. 
As the film continues, the girls begin to decide their fates and the boys 
love for them becomes even greater.
There is a reason this movie's title is The Virgin Suicides. Anyone looking 
for even remotely happy or exciting entertainment should look elsewhere. This 
is a very heavy film, but one that doesn't lose interest, and isn't too slow. 
The topic of teen suicide gets handled with the greatest of care. The movie 
takes place in the 1970s when teen suicide wasn't as big of an issue as it is 
today. Reactions to the suicides by neighbors, reporters, and teenagers are 
an interesting addition that shows speculation on the Lisbon sisters isnât 
just a teenage guy thing. The surprising lack of grief for the lost sister 
shows what a different family this is. âThe girls walked into school like 
nothing had happened.â? says the narrator.
Since the movie gets told almost entirely in flashback by the boys, (the 
narrator is Giovanni Ribisi) we get just as confused about what's going on in 
the Lisbon household as they were. The reasons why Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are so 
strict with their children never get fully explained. Mr. Lisbon frequently 
tunes in and out of a conversation, and often rattles on about the great 
flying machines, and how they won us the war. Mrs. Lisbon insists the girls 
go to church so that they can absorb the Catholic faith. Both parents are a 
little out of it. The beauty of the girls and some wonderful shots from 
director Sofia Coppola make this a stunning and dreamlike fantasy. A fantasy 
that ends in an inevitable shocking horror.
The acting is superb. Kirsten Dunst has never been more appealing, and she's 
a standout from the other Lisbon girls. James Woods and Kathleen Turner are 
also very good as the two parents. They perfectly convey their feelings while 
still making us wonder what's going on in their heads. Hopefully this movie 
will make parents think about talking and listening to their children more. 
Maybe if the parents had listened or done something different, nothing would 
have happened. 
The awkwardness and confusion felt by the boys is what this movie is all 
about. No matter where they are today, whether it's in drug rehab, still 
living in the same town, or thousands of miles away, no boy living at that 
time in that place will ever forget the Lisbon sisters. The thought of 
conquering the unconquerable as mentioned earlier still exists in their mind. 
The love, mystery, and bewilderment of their universe linger as well. They 
can't forget the sisters, neither can I.

        When Sofia Coppola landed the key role as Mary Corleone in the
final chapter of her father Francis Ford Coppola's legendary "Godfather"
trilogy, the cries of nepotism could be heard as far away as the Hollywood
Hills.  Overt familial favoritism notwithstanding, the greater outcry was
that Sofia simply wasn't good enough and for many, single-handedly ruined
the picture.
        In the ten years since "The Godfather: Part III," the 29-year-old
actress has had few film roles--she's appeared as Cindy in "Inside Monkey
Zetterland," as herself in Dad's documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A
Filmmaker's Apocalypse," and as Saché in last year's "Star Wars" prequel to
name the sum-total.  In short, she's done very little and failed to make
much of an impression.
        Switching to behind the camera as both writer and director, Coppola
might well have found her niche.  Skeptics will be quick to question just
how much of the finished product is Sofia's handiwork, given her bloodline
and insider connections, but the film plays very much *unlike* a Francis
Ford Coppola movie and in some ways that's a finer compliment than calling
her a chip off the old block.
        "The Virgin Suicides" is a deliberately-paced (or "slow" if you're
predisposed to cynicism) gothic fantasy about the ill-fated Lisbon
sisters--Cecilia, Bonnie, Lux, Mary, and Therese--told from the vantage of
the neighborhood boys who worshipped them from afar.  It's a fragile and
delicate affair, as fragile and delicate as the teenage female condition it
examines.  The film shimmers, breathes, and moves both on air and with Air,
since it's scored by the French avant-pop duo with a sparing insistence.
        The film is all the better for posing more questions than answers,
since its theme--the universal dilemma of young women struggling with their
blossoming sexuality--is not easily concluded.  The five young actresses,
among them Kirsten Dunst as the bold Lux, are fabulous, as are veterans
James Woods and a surrealistically frumpy-looking Kathleen Turner as their
parents.  Woods, especially, is remarkable since he rarely plays soft and
his Mr. Lisbon is a treasure of paternal quirks and insecurities.
        Behind the lens, Coppola's direction is sure-footed, her pacing
perfect.  And the power, wit, and calculated efficacy of her insightful
screenplay (based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides) can best be summed up
by a single line of dialogue.  Shortly after her first failed suicide
attempt, the youngest Lisbon daughter tells a male caregiver who falsely
assumes that everything is OK now "obviously, doctor, you've never been a
13-year-old girl."
        Watching the splendid "The Virgin Suicides," it's quite obvious
that Sofia Coppola has.

A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
When Francis Ford Coppola entered the movie business,
he should have anticipated that his entire family
would also leave their own mark. Sofia Coppola is his
daughter, Talia Shire is his sister, and Nicolas Cage
is his nephew. Cage married Patricia Arquette, Sofia
Coppola married Spike (`Being John Malkovich') Jonze,
and Talia Shire wed Jack Schwartzman, a film producer.
The Schwartzmans had two children, Jason, who starred
in 1998's `Rushmore', and Robert, whose feature film
debut is in cousin Sofia's `The Virgin Suicides'.
If Sofia is trying hard to live up to her family's
distinguished name, then she doesn't show it, because
`Virgin Suicides' is a leisurely-paced, darkly comical
and often dreamlike first feature. After her
performance in `The Godfather Part III' received
critical pans, she turned her ambitions to photography
and fashion, and succeeded in both fields. Her unique
visual flair lends a quiet subtlety to her portrait of
suburban dismay.
`The Virgin Suicides', based on the novel by Jeffrey
Eugenides, is the story of five unattainable teenage
girls and the four boys who lust after them in 1970's
Michigan. The five Lisbon sisters live in a quiet
suburban house with their domineering mother (Kathleen
Turner) and their passive father (James Woods). The
mysterious girls live by strict rules, and the fact
that they're not allowed to go out at night adds to
the boys' obsession.
Things become more mysterious when the youngest Lisbon
sister, Cecilia (Hanna Hall), attempts a suicide.
`You've never been a thirteen-year-old girl,' she
tells a psychologist (Danny DeVito). When she gets
better, the parents let the girls throw the first and
only party of their short lives. For the first time,
the neighborhood boys are able to sneak a peek at the
world of the Lisbon sisters.
But the party turns tragic as Cecilia tries suicide
once again, and succeeds. An even thicker cloud of
mystery shrouds the house Strangely, in the aftermath,
all the Lisbons act as if the suicide had never
occurred, 
It is at this point that school hunk Trip Fontaine
(Josh Hartnett) meets the dreamily gorgeous Lux Lisbon
(Kirsten Dunst). Against all odds, he is able to
persuade Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take her to the
homecoming dance. He is the first and only boy to ever
get close to one of the sisters. But the events that
occur at the dance lead Mr. And Mrs. Lisbon to remove
the girls from school and leave them locked up in the
house 24 hours a day. This builds up to a climax that
will be the most talked about aspect of the film.
Sofia Coppola has succeeded in painting a vivid
portrait of adolescent obsession that feels a lot like
a dream. Like all dreams, not everything is clear at
first, and everything is open to interpretation.
Coppola's film is a mystery with an open ending, like
waking up from a nightmare because you can't dream
your own death.
There's so much subtlety here, that it makes me wonder
why the filmmakers provided voice-over narration (by
Giovanni Ribisi) to tell the emotions of the
characters in almost every scene. It's an overused
tactic that's used to death in this film. Coppola's
pictures speak louder than words, and the film would
have been even better without the running commentary. 
James Woods and Kathleen Turner give nice, restrained
performances as the parents, but it is the beautiful
Kirsten Dunst (`Dick', `Interview With The Vampire')
who steals the show. We never learn very much about
the Lisbon sisters, but Dunst makes Lux the one the
audience is still thinking about when the film is
over.
Sofia Coppola's absorbing debut film proves once again
that the only good films about teenagers are from the
art-house. With its delicate balance of fantasy and
reality, a screen full of beautiful imagery, and a
haunting musical score by Air that I ended up
purchasing, `The Virgin Suicides' is one of the first
pleasant surprises to emerge from Sundance 2000.

What causes someone to grow so tired of the world--so unhappy and weary of 
going through the paces on a day-to-day basis--that they are driven to take 
their own life? Any one person can speculate such a question all they want, 
but inevitably will fail to draw a satisfying conclusion. There are 
occurrences in life that can't be explained, and the tragic mystery that is 
suicide is something that remains unresolved for everyone except the victim, 
who seems to hold all the answers, yet, at the same time, none at all.
Based on the 1993 novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin 
Suicides" is an elucidating masterpiece, a film of both penetrating beauty 
and baffling perplexity. It is startling and maybe even a little frightening, 
not because it is a typical horror film, but because the unforgettable themes 
and images it presents are distinct, irrefutable, and unshakably puzzling. 
More questions than answers are posed throughout the story, and that is how 
it should be--its level of not knowing puts a stirring air of uneasiness over 
the proceedings and its sorrowful characters.
Set in the mid-'70s in the upper-middle-class Michigan suburbs, the film is 
told largely from the points-of-view of four neighborhood boys who live right 
down the street from the home of the much-talked-about Lisbon family, headed 
by a passive father (James Woods) and a restricting, Catholic mother 
(Kathleen Turner). The fascination for the four boys is based largely on the 
five Lisbon sisters--13-year-old Cecilia (Hanna Hall), 14-year-old Lux 
(Kirsten Dunst), 15-year-old Bonnie (Chelsea Swain), 16-year-old Mary (A.J. 
Cook), and 17-year-old Therese (Leslie Hayman)--each of which signify 
unattainable beauty and innocence unchanged.
Narrated by one of the boys as an adult (Giovanni Ribisi), who occasionally 
still holds reunions with his childhood friends, where they theorize on the 
notable gaps missing in the lives of the late Lisbon sisters, the first words 
uttered at the film's start are, "Cecilia was the first to go," as we see her 
face-up in a bathtub of water, her wrists slit open. It is her first suicide 
attempt, and although she survives, questions of the parents' upbringing and 
what goes on behind their closed doors become headline news for television 
stations, ready to exploit the grim subject of teenage suicide. 
Following her physical recovery, Cecilia is forced to see a psychiatrist 
(Danny DeVito), who doesn't have a clue how to help a 13-year-old girl 
fatally hurting internally. Weeks later, Cecilia attempts suicide again, and 
succeeds, impaling herself on the iron fence that surrounds their home. 
Heartbroken and confused, the father drifts into psychological seclusion, 
while the mother is bewildered to why her youngest daughter would do such a 
thing. 
The Lisbon girls, who are only allowed to leave the house's property long 
enough to attend school, are severely sheltered, with the exception of the 
flirtatious, somewhat rebellious Lux. Soon, things return to normal in the 
Lisbon household, until Lux catches the eye of the popular, smooth, 
pot-smoking Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett). For both Trip and Lux, it is their 
first experience with teenage love, and for the first and last time, Trip 
convinces the Lisbon father, who is a math teacher at the high school, to 
allow himself and three other classmates to accompany the sisters to the 
upcoming Homecoming Dance. All does not remain happy for long, as something 
occurs between Trip and Lux that forever changes the lives of the entire 
Lisbon family, and questionably plays a part in the inexorable, 
heartbreakingly lyrical final act.
In her directing debut, 29-year-old Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford 
Coppola) has conceived of a motion picture filled with overwhelming intensity 
and remarkable conviction. In 1990, playing the ill-fated Mary Corleone in 
"The Godfather III," Coppola gave an embarrassing performance that, for some 
critics, nearly ruined the entire production. After seeing "The Virgin 
Suicides," it is clear that Coppola's destiny lies in her adeptness of, not 
acting, but filmmaking and screenwriting. Reportedly, Jeffrey Eugenides' 
novel is Coppola's favorite novel, and so in adapting it for the screen, she 
felt it was her responsibility to not only be faithful to the source 
material, but to do it complete justice. While the book remains unread by 
myself, the film can easily stand alone as a showcase for a rightfully 
burgeoning career for Sofia Coppola.
The actors--every one of them--perfectly embody their characters, and it is 
their subtle performances that give the film an added level of realism and 
unforced poignancy. Kirsten Dunst (1999's "Drop Dead Gorgeous") just keeps 
getting better with every role, and she brings the sexually charged Lux, who, 
despite her closeness with her siblings, seems to have been meant to be born 
into an entirely different family, to pulsating life. Her desperation to 
break out from the strict confines of her household are palpably felt without 
having to use dialogue to explain her longings, and it is a tribute to 
Dunst's talent that she could possibly pull off such a tricky provocation. 
Of the rest of the Lisbon sisters, Hanna Hall (who played the young Jenny in 
1994's "Forrest Gump") makes the most lasting impression as Cecilia, the 
first to commit suicide. Although mostly absent following her suicide in the 
first half-hour, visions of her tragic soul are glimpsed throughout, and her 
sullen presence consistently hangs over all that follows.
As the sisters' parents, James Woods underplays to spectacular effect as the 
father, while Kathleen Turner, nabbing her first noteworthy role in years, is 
exceptional as the mother, who finally decides to take her four daughters out 
of school and keep them locked inside the house, cut off from all outside 
influences that she fears they are being brainwashed by. In one scene that 
rings mightily true, the mother forces Lux to burn all of her music records, 
all the while Lux tearfully begs her not to make her do such a thing.
Never even seeming like he is playing a character, Josh Hartnett (2000's 
"Here on Earth") is Trip Fontaine, the "oh-so-cool" Jim Morrison-lookalike 
who doesn't quite know how to react when, for once, he isn't the one being 
pined for, but rather becomes swept away himself by his crush on Lux. In only 
a few sequences, teenage first love is more accurately portrayed than in all 
of the previous teen movies of the last year combined. One particular scene, 
in which Lux and Trip sit next to each other in the darkened school 
auditorium and shyly flirt with the possibility of holding hands, is 
something that most anyone can relate to, yet is an almost always clumsily 
overlooked nuance about human nature that is bypassed in other similar films.
Aiding in capturing the '70s era is a soundtrack that is precisely on-target, 
including Heart's "Magic Man," Styx's "Come Sail Away," and Carole King's 
"Far Away," and the luminous music score by the French group Air, serves to 
strengthen the picture's already highly evocative tone.
The final ten minutes of "The Virgin Suicides" appear to be a collection of 
fragmented memories, told again by the neighborhood boys who still manage to 
keep in touch with the Lisbon sisters, even after they are closed in their 
home. The details are shady and purposefully disjointed, and the 
nightmarishly real action reaches a head when the boys finally are given a 
chance to come into face-to-face contact with their idealistic obsessions 
once again. 
There are no easy answers presented in Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides." 
Twenty-five years later, following the deaths of all five of the Lisbon 
sisters, their impact in the lives of those admiring boys lives on, and the 
mystery surrounding what the driving force was in their pact to 
simultaneously end their lives is what gives the film added weight, as well 
as a lingering impression on the viewer. "The Virgin Suicides" is a 
devastating, haunting motion picture of inconceivable power.

THE VIRGIN SUICIDES -- a title to be taken literally -- marks the
feature film debut of Sofia Coppola as a writer and director.  With its
morose subject matter, this comedy would certainly have to be classified
as a black comedy, but its tone is disarmingly light.
Some films leave their audiences uneasy until the viewers sink into the
film's rhythms and approach, but not THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, which
constantly confounds while it intrigues.  Don't be surprised if you
never laugh, and yet you somehow find the film strangely captivating
nevertheless.
On a tree-lined suburban street in the 1970s lives the Lisbon family.
As American as apple pie, the large family is headed by a high school
math teacher and nerd, played with unusual reserve by James Woods, and
his wife, played straightforwardly by Kathleen Turner.  They have 5
teenage daughters just a year apart in their ages: Therese (Leslie
Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelsea Swain),  Lux (Kirsten Dunst)
and Cecilia (Hannah Hall).  The neighborhood boys, from whose point of
view the story is told, remark on how hard it is to belief that such
beautiful girls came from such unattractive parents.
Early on, 13-year-old Cecilia commits suicide, which causes the already
cautious Lisbon family to begin erecting a virtual moat around the
family home.  The parents get even stricter after another incident later
in the picture.  (We are told from the very beginning that all 5 girls
will eventually commit suicide.)
The film's humor is so dry and subtle that is easy to miss.  The only
outlandish scene comes during a debutante ball in which asphyxiation is
the theme.  The participants wear gas masks and smoke big cigars to
enhance the mood.
What makes the picture is the deliciously wicked performance by Kirsten
Dunst (DROP DEAD GORGEOUS and DICK).  She keeps you on your toes
guessing what she will do next, with her best scene involving a simple
footsie under the table.
The problem with the script, which is based on Jeffrey Eugenides's
novel, is that most of the incidents have been done before and better.
The scene of the boys using a telescope to stare at a girl having sex,
for example, appears in many other teen comedies.  Overall the picture
feels like a pale imitation of HAROLD AND MAUDE.
All of the above notwithstanding, the movie has a captivating aspect
that's hard to describe.  Still, it is one that would be hard to
recommend and that leaves you feeling strangely ambivalent as to whether
you liked it or not.  It's frequently intriguing, and yet never quite
satisfying.
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES runs 1:37.  It is not rated but would probably be an
R for drug usage, underage drinking, language and mature themes
including teenage suicide.  The movie would be acceptable only for high
school seniors and above.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews:  The Virgin Suicides
Rated [R], 97 minutes
Starring Kathleen Turner, James Woods, Kirsten Dunst
Based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides
Screenplay and Directed by Sofia Coppola
website: www..com
IN SHORT: For once, an arthouse flick with an open ending (so to speak)
didn't make me want to barf.
OK, that gets the Cranky attitude stuff out of the way so that I may
praise a remarkably coherent first effort (as a writer/director) by
Sofia Coppola, who took an unfair amount of razzing for appearing in her
dad's Godfather III. Sofia's opening gambit is a story set against the
teenaged angst of coming of age in the 1970s. While you know how it's
going to turn out from the very beginning of the story, it's up to you
to try to figure out the "why" of it all. For those of us past our teen
years, there are enough touchstones in this flick to wake the dead
(memories) and make us recall our own toying with suicidal impulses.[not
me of course... I had to hit college to get seriously depressed...]
In a pleasant enough house in a pleasant enough suburb somewhere in the
US of A live the Lisbon family. Mom (Kathleen Turner) is an overweight,
frumpish woman. Dad (James Woods) is an emasculated and wimpy looking
math teacher at the local high school. The young ladies -- played by
Leslie Hayman, AJ Cook, Chelse Swain, Hanna Hall and Kirsten Dunst --
range in age from thirteen to seventeen and, as the story's adult
narrator points out, no one in town can discern how two shlumpy parents
turned out five examples of feminine perfection. Lux Lisbon (Dunst) is
the centerpiece of the quintet; her introduction is shot in the manner
of teevee commercials of the time (slo-mo and soft focus, with sun
blasting from behind. All you need is Donovan singing "Wear Your Love
Like Heaven" and you could sell soap or shampoo]. Five boys, distant
admirers all, are the counterpoints to the five girls, though they can't
do more than admire from a distance. By keeping most of the film
focussed on Lux, and by lumping the boys together as an anonymous pool,
Coppola keeps the story clean, focused and easy to follow.
The sisters all attend the local public school. They don't go to dances.
They don't date. They don't go out, period. They rarely do much more
than lounge on the lawn, and that happens only once in a blue moon.
Being so unreachable naturally makes them all the more attractive. The
sole male to make the effort, football star Trip Fontaine (Josh
Hartnett) is brushed off succinctly by Lux.
As our narrator (voiced by Giovanni Ribisi) tells us: "Cecilia was the
first to go," though she will survive the attempt and be counseled by a
hospital shrink (a cameo appearance by Danny DeVito). This unexpected
behavior on the part of their youngest daughter gets the parents to
loosen up a bit. The age appropriate boys are invited to a closely
supervised party and we, the audience, get our first peek inside the
cloistered world of the Lisbon clan. While the parents are strict, the
world inside the Lisbon household is not that far from "normal." Even as
Lux leads the charge towards teenage sexual rebellion after a group date
for the homecoming dance, the clues that point to the inevitable are so
subtle that I leave them for you to discover . . . which means that I'm
so dense I could have easily spent hours doing the film student
post-viewing dissertation thing.
Cranky should point out that his teenage years fell in the same time
period, the 70s, and that there was one suicide among his peer group --
but not for any reason that matches what happens in this film. Still,
the cast and production design, under Coppola's hand, nailed the look
and feel of the Seventies. Dunst continues her run of notable
performances but James Woods absolutely takes the cake as daddy wimp.
While it's easy to picture Kathleen Turner as an evil shrew mom, her
performance is restrained. The Virgin Suicides is a fair portrait of a
fairly conservative family on whose heads tragedy falls like an
avalanche.
I should point out that the reason I normally dislike open ended
arthouse flicks is that most of 'em leave an open end 'cuz the
screenwriter, usually the director as well, is just too damned lazy to
do the job. So we get an artsy-fartsy excuse for an ending, and
something to argue about over espresso afterwards. Coppola makes no
excuses here. We know the girls are going to die, and they do. The exact
reasons why are the mystery. Discussion is inevitable.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Virgin Suicides, he would have
paid...
On our scale, that's well above average for films on the arthouse
circuit.

   Just the other week, a 23-year-old man who had been a
student at Columbia University murdered his ex-girl friend,
who was then attending the college.  He then proceeded to
the nearest subway station and threw himself under the
wheels of a passing train.  Though most of us are horrified by
events like this, we can understand the emotions that
informed it.  A jealous and vindictive lover is tossed
overboard and slaughters his girl.  Filled with rage, guilt,
fear--overwhelmed with sensation--he ends his own life.  But
not all suicides are understandable, though sociologists from
Durkheim on down have published treatises in attempts to
explain them.  
   In "The Virgin Suicides," Sofia Coppola deals with a suicide
pact made by five teenage girls, all sisters living under
the same roof.  The young women had been confined to their
home by their religious and conservative mother, a possible
explanation for their disastrous action.  While one critic of
this film--recently named one of the two best from the
January 2000 Sundance Festival--has reproached the writer-
director and, by extension the novelist for failing to interpret
the suicides, he completely misses the point.  The whole
essence of "The Virgin Suicides" is that we simply do not
know the answer--that suicide is one of the great mysteries of
our nature that cannot be resolved with any degree of
closure.
   Jeffrey Eugenides's book, meant to be interpreted as fable,
allegory, a fairy tale if you will, must have been difficult to
make cinematic but Sofia Coppola--daughter of Francis Ford
Coppola who is listed as one of the producers--has done a
most effective job of giving screen life to the tale.  Suffused in
equal measure by sardonic humor and a persistently tragic
texture, "The Virgin Suicides" possesses the period feel of
Ang Lee's marvelous "The Ice Storm," which hones in on the
upper-middle-class America of the early 1970s, probing the
pathologies which infect the lives of Connecticut families. 
The story is told from the collective point of view of five
adolescent boys who had obsessed about their counterparts
across the way and is narrated by Giovanni Ribisi, invisibly
standing in for the quintet.  The Lisbon girls, whose age
range is 13 to 17, are ruled austerely by their mother
(Kathleen Turner), who is conceivably all too concerned about
the social pathologies induced by the new sexual freedom of
the seventies.  Their father (James Woods) by contrast is a
timid math teacher who reluctantly goes along with his wife's
inflexibility and endeavors to make up for his lack of
communication with her by reaching out to the students in his
classes and in the neighborhood.  The Lisbon family is torn
apart by the suicide of the 13-year-old Cecilia (Hanna R.
Hall), who succeeds on her second attempt for reasons that
absolutely nobody can fathom--not even the psychiatrist who
had interviewed her, Dr. Hornicker (Danny De Vito).  The
story later turns to the sprouting relationship of the school's
hunk, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) with the most beautiful of
the Lisbon girls, Lux (Kirsten Dunst).  Lux, who had been
about the only girl in the school to ignore Trip, soon becomes
his lover, until during one destructive night she commits an
act that causes her mother to haul her entire brood out of the
school, effectively putting them under house arrest for several
weeks.
   It would be a mistake to look upon "Virgin Suicides" as yet
another satire of American middle-class suburban life
("American Beauty") or of the obsessiveness that seems to
rule particular individuals in this environment ("Election"). 
"Virgin Suicides" cannot be reduced to a tract about how to
bring up your kids or a psychological study of girls who are
possessed by a kind of devil or even a commentary on the
emptiness of life among the well-to-do in contemporary
America.  Sofia Coppola, I think, has captured the vision of
novelist Jeffrey Eugenides, which is that in this enigmatic
existence of ours, some things just cannot be rationally
explained.  An attending physician treating Cecilia after her
attempted suicide shakes his head and counsels, "You have
not been around, girl....You're not old enough to know what
tragedy there is in life" and gets her reply, "You've never
been a 13-year-old girl." At that point we realize that no
resolution is going to come from Coppola's screenplay, no
facile conclusion will be reached.  Neat solutions are the stuff
of commercial movies.
   Kathleen Turner and James Woods perform out of
character as the parents. Turner is made up as a frumpy
housewife and Woods, in his permanent press jacket realizes
the very opposite of his usual over-the-top performance.  The
young men from whose point of view the picture is made are
the sorts we all were in high school--one justifiably
swaggering, another fairly bold, others bashful and balking. 
But all the boys have a healthy interest in what the fair sex
are like and take pleasure in peering through a telescope to
observe the girls in their shower and, in a few instances,
performing sexual acts on the roof of the Lisbon home.  In
one panorama, a group of workmen destroy trees affected
with a fungus--an obvious metaphor for a creeping infirmity
that has influenced the neighborhood.  In another scene,
some adults in the community are enjoying a cocktail party,
giving us the erroneous impression that Coppola and
Eugenides believe that a more accountable assembly would
instead engage in group therapy sessions to try to
understand the malady which has defiled the district.  In the
final analysis, we are deliberately and cleverly left hanging,
as unsure of the causes of the alienation of these children as
we were when we entered the theater.  That, in no small
measure, is what makes this an exceptional film.
Not Rated.  Running Time: 97 minutes.  (C) 2000

I don't know when it started, but films that open with shots of suburbia
give me the chills.  Oak-lined streets, white picket fences, moms
watering the lawn, kids playing basketball, dads barbequing  should I
really find them that creepy, or is American Beauty still fresh in my
mind?  You practically expect something alarming to happen, like for the
camera to pan down and reveal a human ear lying in the grass (a la David
Lynch's Blue Velvet).
It's no Blue Velvet, but The Virgin Suicides has a development just as
disturbing.  And all it takes is one line to snap you out of the
suburban daydream  `Cecilia was the first to go.'  The images of moms
and dads and lawns and fences are replaced with one of a
thirteen-year-old girl in a bathtub filled with crimson-tinged water.
It's akin to a slap across the face.  And like Lester Burnham's opening
monologue in American Beauty, that line gives you an idea of what to
expect from the rest of the film.
Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall, young Jenny in Forrest Gump), we learn, is the
youngest daughter in the Lisbon family.  The Lisbons (James Woods, Any
Given Sunday and Kathleen Turner, Baby Geniuses) are the parents of five
beautiful teenaged daughters that look like they just stepped out of a
Golden Grahams commercial.  There's fourteen-year-old Bonnie (Chelse
Swain, sister of Lolita's Dominique), fifteen-year-old Lux (Kirsten
Dunst, Dick), sixteen-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook) and seventeen-year-old
Therese (Leslie Hayman).  Together, the Lisbon daughters form their own
little clique of well-developed, blonde girls, which, as you might
expect, attracts the attention of every teenaged boy within pheromone
range.
But the Lisbon parents are maniacally strict, barely allowing their
voluptuous flock to leave the house, let alone date boys, which only
makes the forbidden girls more tantalizing.  In fact, Suicides is told
from the point of view of a boy that lived in the neighborhood (Giovanni
Ribisi, Boiler Room, provides the narration but does not appear in the
film).
Like other similarly aged young men that lived near the Lisbons, the
narrator explains their infatuation with the girls led them to find and
collect Lisbon memorabilia.  They still talk about them, even though the
events that play out in the film transpired twenty-five years ago.  The
boys-turned-men have a burning desire to know what went on in the Lisbon
house, but just don't have enough information to piece the past
together.
While Cecilia's suicide was a major catalyst for the actions of the
other Lisbon girls, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett, Here on Earth) was
certainly another.  The most popular boy in school, Trip successfully
woos Lux with his rock-star swagger (and a wig like Kelso on That 70s
Show), but then ditches her after a school dance, setting off a chain of
tragic events in the Lisbon house; events that nobody seemed to care
about but the narrator and his friends.
Suicides is full of amazing performances from everyone, including the
interchangeable Lisbon girls.  Woods character gets nuttier and nuttier
as the film progresses and things in his house begin to spin out of
control.  The luminous Dunst chalks up another fantastic performance 
it's hard to believe she just turned eighteen.  But the surprising
standout acting-wise is Hartnett, who gets so far into his role that
you'll likely forget that it's him.  Scott Glenn (Firestorm) and Danny
DeVito (Drowning Mona) also appear in one scene apiece.
Suicides is the directorial debut of Sofia Coppola, the daughter of
Oscar winner Francis Ford Coppola, who, until now, was probably most
famous for playing Mary Corleone in The Godfather, Part III or, at best,
the wife of last year's Oscar-nominee Spike Jonze (Being John
Malkovich).  But Sofia proves here that's she's just as talented as her
pop, her Oscar-winner cousin (Nicolas Cage), her Oscar-winning grandpa
(Carmine Coppola), her Oscar-nominated aunt (Talia Shire) or her
husband.  Coppola adapted the script from Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel
of the same name, and pumped the music full of great period music (but
not stuff that you're tired of hearing in films), like Heart, Todd
Rundgren, ELO and Janis Ian.  The standout score was provided by the
French band Air.

Review URL: http://www.3blackchicks.com/bamsvirgin.html
I grew up in 1970's Detroit, not very far from Grosse Point--the setting
in both time and place for this movie--but it might as well have been
set in a galaxy far, far away in the year 2525, for all intents and
purposes.  It's like my Grandfather Wolfe used'ta say: "Some things are
universal; but some shit's just Weird."
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Life according to The Virgin Suicides shows that 1970's Grosse Pointe,
Michigan to be a place of superficial calm and temporary beauty; the
beauty would be erased by the cutting-down of numerous dead trees that
lined the neighborhood, and the calm would be shattered by neighborhood
gossips, scavenging reporters, and a strange family for whom the word
"dysfunctional" was probably coined.
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) are completely
out-of-touch with their five teenage daughters, 13-year-old Cecilia
(Hanna Hall), 14-year-old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), 15-year-old Bonnie
(Chelse Swain), 16-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook), and 17-year-old Therese
(Leslie Hayman).  The neighborhood boys [their names are listed above;
hellifi could tell you which one was which] are fascinated by the girls,
especially after Cecilia commits suicide--and local stud, Trip Fontaine
(Josh Hartnett), takes a liking to Lux.  Unfortunately, Lux's burgeoning
libido, and Trip's massive brain spasm, combine for disasterous effects
for the four remaining sisters.
The Upshot:
In my review of AMERICAN BEAUTY earlier this year, I disagreed with The
Diva's AB review, on the basis of how she saw the dysfunctions in the
families that were its primary focus; but Diva could've as easily been
writing on-point about the Lisbon family - and more precisely, about the
disconnect I felt with damn near everything about "Virgin".  That last
bit is key: because where I felt that I "knew" good old Lester and
Carolyn and the rest of the gang, I haven't the slightest clue _what_
the Lisbon family's deal was.  And what's more: I just couldn't bring
myself to care.
Maybe it was the sheer number of unexplained - no, make that _undefined_
- characters.  Lux was fairly easy to pick out of a crowd; Kirsten Dunst
is a force to be reckoned with, even when everything around her seems to
be less-than-gelled.  And the Trip Fontaine character, as played by Josh
"Young Tommy Lee Jones" Hartnett, also seemed otherworldy.  Looking at
the movie on terms of these two characters and actors, you get a
*completely* different vibe than what happens when the rest of the
motley crew joins in.
Most of the other characters, and moreso, the actors who played them,
seemed to be in a psychedelic haze, wondering what exactly their
Motivation was supposed to be.  Particularly jarring were James Woods
and Kathleen Turner (who hasn't aged well at all, poor girl) as Ma and
Pa Lisbon; both actors seemed worlds away from what their resumes have
shown they're capable of.  As for their characters, all signs pointed to
their Major Problem being somehow involved (to a detrimental point) with
religion.  I think.  Or maybe it was just the ill-effects of being in a
community full of neighbors as rotten as the rapidly dying trees, who
knows.  Or, cares.  The rest [say it in a B&W Gilliganese fashion -
"...the movie star/and the rest..." - and you'll Feel me] of the
characters - with possibly the exception of Chase (Anthony DeSimone) -
blended into a chorus of sorts, having no real distinguishing marks to
tell one from the other.  The credits for the cast list ironically told
me more about who was who, than anything I saw on-screen. I included the
detailed cast and character list above, just for giggles; it would take
a supreme act to make me want to actually include all of the numerous
undefined players within the body of this review.
To her credit, though, writer/director Sophia Coppola showed some
gutsiness in putting "Virgin" together.  Knowing her primarily as
Francis Ford Coppola's sproggen, and the worst thing about a pretty bad
rendering of GODFATHER 3 (1 and 2 were masterpieces; wha'happen?), I was
prepared to write this one off early on, and probably would not have
gone to see it at all had it not been for favorable buzz about this
project [makes me wonder just what movie those critics saw; but, Strokes
For Folks].  Coppola was a lot more competent than I would've given her
credit for, and though I couldn't catch her groove, I could definitely
see her distinctive style shining through.  Wasn't quite enough to win
me over, but still, I give props where props are due.
Usually, when I see based-on-a-book movies that I don't particularly
like, I have a hankerin' to read the book.  Not so, this time.  One
thing, though: whoever decided that this film was a "dark comedy", was
probably smokin' whatever Trip left behind in his roach clip.  Just Say
No, dude; Just Say No.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
I used to sweat it when I watched an Art Fillum and just didn't see what
everyone was raving about. Bump *that*; I haven't got time for the pain.
Call me uncouth if you wanna - hey, I've been called worse - but I just
couldn't get with this one.  I like my Dysfunctional Families a little
more understandable in their dysfunctions; weird for weird's sake just
goes right past me.  So when's American Beauty coming out on DVD, eh?
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES (rating: yellowlight):
Certainly killed two hours of *my* day.

Starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Josh Hartnett,
Hanna Hall, Chelse Swain, A.J. Cook, Leslie Hayman and the voice of
Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by Sofia Coppola. Rated R.
The Lisbon sisters enchanted the boys in the neighborhood. They toyed
with them, taunted them, tempted them and then just as the boys thought
that they were going to score, the girls committed suicide. Was this
all a cruel game they played, a last hurrah against the culture that
restricted them? Or was it a subconscious, desperate cry for help and
finally a release from a life they hated? Such is the difficult subject
matter of Sophia Coppola's powerful, confident directing debut entitled
The Virgin Suicides, a visually stunning, emotionally wrenching trip
through the dark side of 70's suburbia.
There were five of them: Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Cecilia (Hanna Hall),
Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), Therese (Leslie Hayman).
Cecilia, the youngest, was the first to go. She tried to kill herself
by slitting her wrists in a bathtub; when that didn't work, she jumped
out of a window and landed directly on a spiked fence. Why she did what
she did is ambiguous. The mother (Kathleen Turner), a devoutly Catholic
woman who was paranoidly protective as it was, becomes even more
cautious. The dad (James Woods), a calm, reserved schoolteacher seems
to care less. In any event, the rest of the girls' lives are never the
same again.
Meanwhile, the boys gather at a house across the street and spy on the
Lisbon sisters through a telescope. They begin a collection of Lisbon
souvenirs -- diaries, clothes, hairpins, etc. When, on prom night, Lux
sleeps with the school rebel Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) on the
football field, mommy goes mad and shuts the girls off from the world
completely. After hearing a church sermon, she makes Lux burn her rock
records. The sisters' only contact with other people is through cryptic
messages they and the boys send to each other until one night they
finally build up the courage to end it all.
The Virgin Suicides brings a new meaning to the age-old
complaint "Parents just don't understand." This is the '70's, after
all -- the "ME" decade -- where, thanks to the "hippie" counterculture,
teens began to be looked upon as something resembling the spawn of
Satan. It's understandable, then, why Mrs. Lisbon got the idea that the
best way to protect her daughters from the evils of the other teenagers
was to shut them off completely. This film has been attacked by the
Catholic League, who charge that the girls commit suicide because they
couldn't stand their Catholic upbringing. These are misguided
complaints -- Catholicism had little to do with it.
The story is told from the point of view of the boys by a sort of
collective narrator (Giovanni Ribisi, who never actually appears). We
see much of the events from the outside looking in. Watching the film
is a little bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. We're told very
little outright -- the boys concede that they could not even begin to
understand the complexity of the Lisbon sisters -- and are expected to
figure it out on our own. The film's ending, surprising despite its
inevitability, leaves a lot of room for debate.
Sofia Coppola, never quite able to hit it big as an actress despite the
prominence of her director father Francis Ford Coppola, shows great
promise behind the camera. She has a surprising visual flair: the
repeating shot of Lux's sad face translucently superimposed over a
picturesque grass field with beautiful sunny skies above is hypnotic
and strangely ominous. Her sparing use of camera tricks like split-
screen and slow motion turn out to have a haunting effect and the
film's bleak, cold color palette gives it an appropriately unrealistic,
isolated, out-of-touch look, perhaps mimicking the girls' feelings.
The Virgin Suicides is a spellbinding tale of pubescent discovery,
parental indifference the fundamental unfairness of the 1970's and the
power that childhood memories can hold. It's rich, poignant, rewarding
and ultimately unforgettable.

As I walked out of "The Virgin Suicides", confused, and depressed about my 
confusion, a fellow member of the audience, whose girlfriend had walked ahead 
to the bathroom, struck up a conversation with me.
    "A bit strange, that, wasn't it?" he began.
    "I didn't get it," I replied.
    "Don't think it went down well. Not sure what it was about."
    "No, me neither. I've read the book..."
    "Was that a lot different?"
    "Not exactly, but... it was more metaphorical... this, I just didn't get 
it."
And I really didn't. I was glad to see that my view was shared; I'd 
considered that maybe my knowledge of the source material was distracting me, 
but perhaps that wasn't the problem at all. "The Virgin Suicides" is haunting 
in its performances, and engaging in its parts, but is also unbelievably 
bewildering, and not in the way it intends to be.
The setting is suburban America, 1975. Cecilia Lisbon (Hanna Hall), a 13-year 
old daughter of a boring maths teacher (James Woods) and a strict homemaker 
(Kathleen Turner), kills herself by jumping from her bedroom window. There 
are four other siblings in the household: 14-year old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), 
15-year old Bonnie (Chelse Swain), 16-year old Mary (A.J. Cook) and 17-year 
old Therese (Leslie Hayman).
The neighbourhood lads are fascinated by these beautiful creatures, and a 
grown-up version of one of them narrates the movie, which depicts the year 
following Cecilia's death. The boys try to gauge the girls' emotions, mix 
with them, judge what's going on in their household. And when the event 
suggested by the title happens, it is they who discover the corpses. 
As a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, "The Virgin Suicides" was about men who had 
not been able to come to terms with growing up. The Lisbon sisters were 
simply emblems of an adolescent male illusion of perfection, and in wondering 
why they had ended their lives, the flustered, elegiac narrator was really 
trying to figure out what happened to childhood innocence.
At times, Sofia Coppola's film adaptation seems to be trying to recapture 
that sense of confusion, mystery and loss. The voice-over narration, 
beautifully delivered by Giovanni Ribisi, speaks of "having pieces of the 
puzzle, but not being able to put them together" and "arguing about it 
still". But the movie contradicts this by unfolding like a straight drama, 
and seeing the girls too clearly as real people. It spends more time in the 
Lisbon household than it does with the boys, even though it wants to keep the 
Lisbon girls a mystery, and see things from the boys' point of view.
I can't quite give the movie a negative review, because I do concur with the 
critical consensus that Coppola has made an impressive directorial debut. Her 
most famous previous work was as an actress in "The Godfather, Part III", 
where she wasn't terribly good. "The Virgin Suicides" reveals her control 
over other performers, and strong ability to evoke a sense of time and place. 
I just don't think it works as an enigmatic mood piece. It wants to wonder 
about events, and yet show them onscreen as well. What's going on?

Danny DeVito, Scott Glenn, Jonathan Tucker, Michael Pare
Director: Sofia Coppola
The debut film from Sofia Coppola will provoke interest from many people for
many reasons, few of them involving the material itself.  Will she be as
disastrous a filmmaker as she was a performer in The Godfather Part III?  How
will she measure up to her famous father (or for that matter new husband Spike
Jonze, whose directorial debut Being John Malkovich was one of last year's
best)?  Those may be the initial curiosities knowing audiences bring to The
Virgin Suicides but it turns out they really should be far more worried about
the material itself.
Adapted by Coppola from a successful cult novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, The
Virgin Suicides is ostensibly the story of the Lisbon family: five beautiful
blonde daughters of a high school math teacher (James Woods) and his
conservative wife (Kathleen Turner).  Set in the upper class suburbs of Detroit
in the late 1970s it is told from the perspective of the boys next door, the
Weiner boys (that surname is supposed to be funny, I guess, but was already
used to far better effect in Welcome To the Dollhouse).  
The story focuses on the two youngest Lisbon girls.  The youngest, 13 year old
Cecilia (Hannah Hall, Young Jenny in Forrest Gump), recently made an attempt on
her life.  Her disturbed parents are advised by a psychologist (Danny Devito,
in a sharply observed one scene cameo) to allow the girls more interaction with
members of the opposite sex.  A party is planned in the Lisbon basement, the
Weiner boys are invited, and things are mostly awkward and uneventful in a
normal way until the party comes to a shocking early finish.
The story now switches gears to the second youngest girl, the blossoming 15
year old Lux (Kirsten Dunst) who is learning the value of her gorgeous physical
features.  She attracts the attention of school heartthrob Trip Fontaine (Josh
Hartnett) and begins a sly flirtation with him that eventually leads to going
together to a school dance.  It's in this section of the film where The Virgin
Suicides hits its stride.  The material has a familiar teen movie romance feel
but nails every scene with virtues of assured filmmaking, smart acting and good
attention to detail.  
Trip's introduction, perfectly backed by Heart's "Magic Man", is a particularly
vibrant stretch that instantly establishes his character.  A sequence where
Trip is invited to the Lisbon house to watch television is equally astute and,
although we have seen many, the school dance is giddy and memorably fun with
excellent use of Styx's "Come Sail Away" and a brilliant Peach Schnapps
reference.  In addition to the Styx and Heart songs the film has excellent
music supervision overall and also benefits from a superb score by hip French
techno band Air.
However, the film begins to lose focus again after Lux and Trip inevitably
split.  Lack of focus is the main problem with The Virgin Suicides.  Everything
is told from the point of view of an omniscient narrator (Giovanni Ribisi). 
This supposedly represents the collective voice of the Weiner boys, however
nothing in the film itself told me this (I learned it from a friend who had
read it somewhere and it's also contained in the production notes).  
Beyond Lux and Cecilia we never get to know any of the Lisbon girls, they
barely even speak.  The Weiner boys are almost completely indistinguishable,
although Jonathan Tucker's Tim seems to speak more than any of the others. 
There are also disorienting scenes where a grown up Trip (Michael Pare) talks,
on camera, about his relationship with Lux, the only time in the film something
like this happens.  Pare is perfectly cast in the role but the presence of it
in the film is questionable.  There are scattershot scenes which poke fun at
the community but these also seem random, although well done.
On the positive side, Coppola displays a transfixing visual style (Edward
Lachman's cinematography is lovely) and a nice attention to details.  She also
gets wonderful work from all of the actors who actually have a role to play. 
Woods has a nice departure from his usual character as the timid math teacher. 
Turner, completely de-glammed, grabs on to one of her best parts in years and
reminds what a great actress she is.  Of the younger players Hartnett shows
leading man potential in his memorable supporting role, Dunst proves she's
better in a dramatic role like this than in her recent attempts at comedy, and
Hall makes a vividly haunting impression, she reminded me a bit of a younger
Sarah Polley.
Unfortunately these strengths are not enough to overcome the considerable flaws
in the narrative.  The film is structured like a mystery in the first and third
acts but it's a mystery that is never solved.  Even if the movie is simply
about parents keeping too tight a hold on their children the message is never
fully conveyed.  Plus, as entertaining as the middle section of the film is, it
doesn't really fit in with the tone of the rest of the film.  Without learning
very much about the Lisbon girls and the Weiner boys the finale simply lacks
impact.  The movie will inevitably be compared to The Ice Storm, due to time
period and some tone similarities, but it pales terribly next to that milestone
of the genre.

_The_Virgin_Suicides_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
To use an exhausted cliché, the whole of _The_Virgin_Suicides_ is far
less than the sum of its parts.  There are a lot of good individual
elements on display in Sofia Coppola's screen adaptation of Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, yet they never quite gel into something that completely
satisfies--a shortcoming that can be blamed by the film's most
distinctive quality.
With a title like _The_Virgin_Suicides_, the film's outcome is never in
doubt.  The setting is the suburban Midwest sometime in the 1970s, and
the "virgins" in question are the five Lisbon sisters--Lux (Kirsten
Dunst), Therese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain),
and Cecilia (Hanna Hall)--who all take their own lives within the space
of a year.  The exact reasons why is the mystery at the heart of the film
and the point of obsession of three lovestruck boys who live in the
neighborhood, who are most prominently represented by a still-haunted,
unseen adult narrator.
In filmic terms, to label something a "mystery" almost implies the
presence of a clear-cut solution, but there are no real answers given in
_The_Virgin_Suicides_, only questions--a bit ironic, considering its
tell-all title.  The questions, however, appear to be entirely the point.
 The film is supposed to be the shared memory of these boys, and like a
memory faded through time, _The_Virgin_Suicides_ has an ethereal,
dreamlike vagueness.  Not much is ever learned about any of the sisters,
not even the focal Lux, whose adventurous sexuality (she's the exception
to the "virgin" label) leads to a decision by their parents (James Woods
and Kathleen Turner) that plays a part in the girls' destruction.  But
the thinness of their characters is forgivable since they are near-mythic
figures to the boys.
I haven't named any of the boys nor the actors who portray them because
they, too, have virtually no distinct identity individually nor as a
group.  While the dreamlike quality that Coppola gives the film is
largely effective, from the evocative score (by Air) and visual style to
the idealized vision of the Lisbon sisters, extending that to the boys is
a major misstep.  They are the audience's entry vessel into the story,
but it's impossible to connect with them on an emotional (or any other)
level since nothing is ever learned about them.  As such, when the title
event occurs, it's in an emotional vacuum; the audience can't really feel
for the loss of the girls since it never really knew them, and without a
sense of who the boys are and were, it's just as impossible to completely
empathize with or understand their loss.
With the characters intentionally made sketchy, the actors are called on
to shade them in, and Coppola coaxes fine work from them all.  Especially
noteworthy are Woods, both sleazy and charming as the model
airplane-obsessed Lisbon patriarch; Dunst, who strikes the right balance
of innocence and sensuality for Lux; and Josh Hartnett as Trip Fontaine,
the jock stud who takes an interest in Lux.
Much like how strong individual elements add up to a curiously
undernourished whole, the most memorable thing about
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ turns out to be its greatest hindrance: the
atmosphere.  While lending the film an eerie beauty as it unspools, the
relentlessly dreamy mood makes the film similarly weightless. 
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ is indeed an entrancing experience, but there's
nothing solid left to hold onto once it's over.
