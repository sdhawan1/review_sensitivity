A low-budget sleeper, Tony Bill's debut as a
director was a critical and commercial success.
The film has appeal to anyone who has had
fantasies about getting revenge on a tormentor,
or anyone who had trouble finding a place in
the cruel hierarchy of high school society.
Clifford (Chris Makepeace) is the new kid in
school, small and 'sensitive'.  He soon is a
target for Moody (Matt Dillon), who leads a
gang of bullies extorting lunch money from
undersized students.  Refusing to pay, Clifford
instead recruits hulking Linderman (Adam Baldwin)
as a bodyguard.  Linderman is silent and friendless
as the result of a gun accident that killed his
younger brother.  But Moody has a bodyguard of
his own (Hank Salas), whom Linderman seems
afraid of.
Clifford also has an eventful family life.
His father (Martin Mull) is a hotel manager and
his grandmother (Ruth Gordon) is an eccentric
manhunter.  A secondary storyline has Mull
fearing the loss of his job due to Gordon's
drunken hitting on hotel patrons.
"My Bodyguard" has some interesting bit players:
John Houseman as a hotel bigshot, George Wendt
as a maintenance man, and Jennifer Beals as a
high school student.
The script sometimes finds its mark, especially
as Linderman is brought out from his reclusive
shell.  Mull and Gordon are entertaining as usual,
while Dillon and Baldwin are well-cast.  However,
the low budget shows in the sound and editing,
and the finale is implausible.  Linderman and
Clifford win their fist fights in 'Rocky' fashion,
absorbing much punishment at first, but then
suddenly winning.  Clifford's faith in Linderman
is credible (what alternative does he have?),
but not his beating up Moody.
