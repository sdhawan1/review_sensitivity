 Great Expectations (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ethan Hawke,
Gwyenth Paltrow, Robert De Niro and Anne Bancroft.
 What sets a classic above the rest is its timelessness and universality.
 No matter how you bend or twist it, its themes transcend age and culture.
 Screenwriter Mitch Glazer's loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel
transports the tale of a poor orphan boy's rise to riches from 19th-century
England to contemporary Gulf Coast Florida and New York City.
 Glazer simplifies Dickens' complex tale, jettisoning some characters and
subplots, while retaining the essence of the story.
 Director Alfonso Cuaron, Glazer and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have
given the picture a fairy tale-like look, painting scenes - literally and
figuratively - in broad strokes.
 The once-majestic mansion of Miss Dinsmoor (the modern Miss Haversham) is
a colorful collage of decay and neglect.
 Dinsmoor herself, a courageous, eccentric interpretation by Anne Bancroft,
mirrors her surroundings. Her clothes look as though they were shoveled
upon her, while her garish makeup gives her the appearance of a walking
cadaver.
 Contrasting the outrageousness of Bancroft's performance is the intense,
smoldering interplay between Ethan Hawke's Pip (now called Finn) and
Gwyneth Paltrow's Estella.
 When onscreen together, the two exude sensuality. Paltrow's feline air,
her ice-princess persona as Estella is a fine counterpoint to Hawke's
passionate, but somewhat innocent, Finn.
 Paltrow's remoteness makes her a fitting Muse for Hawke's budding artist.
 Their love scenes, a Glazer addition definitely not found in Dickens, are
erotic and shimmering.
 Helping the story along are the two young actors who portray Finn and
Estella as youngsters. Jeremy James Kissner and Raquel Beaudene are dead
ringers for their older counterparts.
 Robert De Niro adds an air of menace as the escaped convict who turns
Finn's life around, while Chris Cooper brings a decency and humanity to the
role of Joe, Finn's uncle.
 Purists may complain about Glazer's treatment, but, overall, this Great
Expectations should hold the interest of young viewers and, perhaps,
rekindle an interest in one of Dickens' better works.

Think of it as Great Expectations for the MTV generation. You wonšt need
your Cliffšs notes for this one; itšs much easier to follow whatšs going
on because itšs shorter and simpler. And thatšs not always a bad thing.
Frankly, I didnšt mind the movie being set in the 20th century. And I
didnšt mind some of the liberties. But I honestly minded two things. I
minded a movie made about a novel I donšt really like. And I minded a
movie that was afraid to get involved with its own story, despite some
merciful editing and shortening of the original. 
I have to reveal my prejudices up front. Dickens is not one of my favorite
authors. His work, to put it bluntly, has always seemed sentimental and
kitschy, and I know I am not alone in this opinion. So I canšt decide if
this story of his is really worth doing in its entirety, if at all. This
movie tries for a hip, rock-and-roll, MTV kind of Dickens, though I donšt
know if MTV and Dickens mix. Kind of like spraypainting paisleys on the
side of a subway train. 
So to make the movie move, its creators jazzed it up and shortened it.
Considerably. Mercifully (it is a 400 plus page novel). True to life, or
at least Hollywoodšs version of life, the movie trims much of the fat from
Dickensšs novel and leaves us with only the essentials: the boy, the girl,
Joe and his shrewish wife (Pips, or in this case Finnšs, sister), the
convict, the old woman, and Pipšs/Finnšs rival lover. 
But when the movie eliminates what was bad or insufferable about the book
it also gets rid of some of what was good. Take for instance the minor
characters. Every Dickens novel is full of minor, colorful characters.
They make (and break) his novels. They usually have more personality than
his main character(s), although most are mere caricatures. The following
minor characters are shrunk or cut entirely from the movie: the lawyer
(almost a cameo in the movie), his assistant (missing), Pipšs boyhood and
later young adulthood friend (missing), the woman who works for the lawyer
(missing), and any action in court (missing). 
So even though the movie makes the story watchable within a two hour time
frame, its brevity makes it almost casual. Gone are the attachments we
form to the loveable, motley cast of characters of the book. Whatšs left
is sort of like a short, modern fairy tale. All in all, itšs not bad.  It
is beautifully shot (like any good music video is) and well acted, despite
occasional intrusions of unkempt  rock music and some bad makeup on
DeNirošs Lustig in the third act. 
But I left feeling not quite satiated. Which, ironically, is the way
Pip/Finn is supposed to feel after getting (almost) everything he really
wants. But that is supposed to be him, not us feeling that way. When we
see an allegedly great romance arenšt we supposed to be touched? To take
the heat off the movie, I again think that some of the fault is in
Dickensšs story.  For a novel so long, it just was just too trivial, not
łgreat˛ enough. With expectations like these top draw from, the film is
sort of doomed from the start.
Not much is embellished or added, except Finnšs new life and the
perfunctory but very tastefully done, (as with nudity elsewhere in the
movie) sex scene. (I hope doesnšt spoil the movie for anyone, but you knew
they were going to get into bed sometime during the show.) 
I grudgingly recommend the movie, which is short enough and entertaining
enough for the younger set so they wonšt get bored, but not quite long
enough or touching enough for the more mature crowd, who may leave the
theatre wondering if they missed something more than just the minor
characters. I wondered what the movie might have been like had its
creators trusted in the (admittedly flawed but lengthy) story. I guess
wešll never know. Again, maybe it canšt be done, given what there is to
work with. So we may have Hollywood marketing men to thank for the
sculpting of this move. These are the guys who tell studio execs that the
demographics of moviegoers are weighted heavily in the 18 to 25 age group,
and this was one movie that certainly wasnšt taking ANY chances taxing
their attention span.

Written by: Mitch Glazer, from the Charles Dickens classic GREAT
EXPECTATIONS
Starring: 
Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro
Ingredients: 
Starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood
Synopsis: 
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998) is a modernized version of a Charles Dickens
novel. In the original Charles Dickens classic an orphan boy named Pip
learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict, his
relationship with a bitter old lady named Miss Havisham, and his
hopeless lifetime infatuation with Havisham's snobbish adopted daughter,
Estella. The gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends Pip
to London for Pip to become an upper class "gentleman." Pip leaves for
London with "great expectations" to be groomed into a gentleman so that
he can one day be classy enough to marry Estella. But life has a way of
complicating things. Pip becomes an arrogant S.O.B. until he learns just
who his secret benefactor is.
In this new 1998 version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS a poor Florida lad named
Finn (Ethan Hawke) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of
helping an escaped convict (Robert De Niro). But soon the focus of
Finn's life becomes romance, as he develops a lifelong infatuation with
Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), an upper crust girl with some psychological
and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment.
Estella was raised in wealth by Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), an
eccentric, aged and embittered, man-hating single aunt whose groom left
her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage. This causes
Estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships, but Finn thinks it's
just a case of snobbery.
When Finn becomes a young man, an anonymous benefactor sets Finn up in
New York with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous
artist. Finn leaves Florida with "great expectations" to be a successful
artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the
snobbish Estella. What will happen to all of Finn's "great
expectations?"
Ethan Hawke is romantic lead. (He romanced Winona Ryder in REALITY
BITES. He romanced Julie Delpy in BEFORE SUNRISE. He romanced Uma
Thurman in GATTACA. Now in GREAT EXPECTATIONS he gets to chase Gwyneth
Paltrow, a rail-thin blonde.) Hawke plays a lovestruck, earnest and
unchanged Finn throughout the film. 
Meanwhile Paltrow portrays Estella as alternating between infuriating
tease and ice princess; Estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in
love and then hurt them rather than become intimate. Anne Bancroft goes
a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic Ms. Dinsmoor, while
Robert De Niro carries off the convict part suitably. 
The difference between the classic Dickens novel and this 1998
adaptation is that the Dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless
themes about class struggle and love, whereas GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998)
is more artsy, less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with
a lifetime tease.

 `Great Expectations,' which stars Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne
Bancroft, takes Dickens' classic tale and presents it in a new milieu.
The names Pip and Havisham have been changed to Finn and Dinsmoor, and the
story now takes place in Florida, but the theme is the same.
 A young boy named Finn, who loves to paint, is lured into the world of a
rich, eccentric and vengeful old woman, Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft) and her
niece, Estella.  Ms. Dinsmoor, whose fiancé left her on their wedding day,
has sworn revenge against all men and Estella is her weapon.  Trained since
early childhood, the young girl knows every trick to manipulating a boy's
heart and despite a warning from Ms Dinsmoor that she'll break his heart,
Finn falls for her.
 As Finn grows older (now played by Hawke), he still makes his way once a
week to Ms. Dinsmoor's decrepit mansion so that he can dance with Estella,
now played by Paltrow.   Finn continues to paint while Estella keeps playing
mind games with him, leading him on and then giving him the cold shoulder
until one day, she leaves for Europe.  Finn, heartbroken, gives up art and
becomes a fisherman until one day, a lawyer mysteriously shows up and grants
him all of his wishes: an art show, money, and a plane ticket to New York,
where Estella now resides.
Once in New York, Finn finds that the woman he is infatuated with has grown
worldlier and more dangerous, but his love for her only increases the more
unobtainable she becomes.  He struggles to become her equal in the hopes
that perhaps then, he may finally have her.
As directed by Alfonso Cuaron, this version of `Great Expectations' is
filled with lush cinematography and production design.  Unlike the David
Lean version, which was darker and more moody, Cuaron fills his picture with
enchanting Gulf Coast scenery and New York kineticism; basically, Dickens
gets the MTV treatment.
 Hawke and Paltrow have the right look for this type of production, but
there is a superficial quality to Hawke's performance, making it difficult
to care about Finn as much as we should.    As Estella, Paltrow is
effectively icy but the real scene-stealers are Bancroft, who gives a fun
and wild performance as the deranged Ms. Dinsmoor, and Robert De Niro, as
the prisoner whom Finn helps escape.
 The best scenes in `Great Expectations' are the early ones, where young
Finn has his first encounters with the prisoner, Ms. Dinsmoor and her
mansion, and Estella.  There is a sense of charm, mystery and danger to
these moments, which is unrivaled in the later parts of the movie.
Overall, `Great Expectations' is not astonishingly good or bad.   Those who
feel compelled to see it because of its cast will most likely enjoy it,
however, for those interested in the story, Lean's version is still the one
to beat.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
 "Great Expectations" looks so incredibly beautiful and magnificently styled
it takes you in practically from the first shot, and the luxuriant visuals
continue throughout the movie as director Alfonso Cuaron carefully and
precisely stages every scene for maximum opulence. Through his eyes even the
subways of New York and the crumbling docks of Florida take on a kind of
gritty glamor. The camera sweeps through the streets, soars into the sky and
whirls around stars Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow, creating some of the
most striking cinematography in quite a while. Look closely and you'll see
very calculated color schemes that set the mood of each moment. Listen and
you'll hear a soundtrack that cleverly mixes many different kinds of music
with effortless grace. This movie is a dessert for the eyes and ears.
 But "Great Expectations" is also like a stunning commercial that wows you
but doesn't tell you much about the product. In the final analysis this
modernization of the Charles Dickens classic has almost nothing to say and
next to no emotional impact whatsoever. Dickens' novel was about the
difficulties of transcending the rigid class system in mid-19th-century
England; the movie ocassionally pays lip service to the idea of moving up in
the world while retaining your principles, but primarily it's about a
sweet-natured guy named Finn (Hawke) who can't get over his infatuation with
a blonde knockout of a tease named Estella (Paltrow). What drives this
obsession remains a mystery since Estella never reveals herself to be
anything more than a pretty face with a cold mind. Any man with half-sense
would have wised up after the first couple of years, but Finn's pursuit of
her goes on for almost 20 years, as she repeatedly tantalizes him, arouses
him, and then splits, usually without so much as a goodbye.
 It's difficult to see this kind of victimization as particularly
romantic --unless you're a 13-year-old boy getting your heart pulverized for
the first time by your own little Estella-- but Cuaron and company do
everything in their power to make it look spectacular. Anyone with even the
slightest interest in film production should see "Great Expectations" just
to savor the richness of the design. But don't expect to come away from it
feeling satisfied. Like its heroine, the movie is ultimately easier to
admire than to embrace.

REVIEW:  Great Expectations
by Luke Buckmaster (bucky@alphalink.com.au)
If you're after a comparison between the classic Charles Dickens novel
Great Expectations and the new, modern day film version of the same
name then I'm afraid I can't give you one (simply because I haven't
read the book).  But I suspect that many of today's teenagers, who the
film is primarily targeted for, are in the same position as I was - no
great expectations, no novel to set the standards.
Generation X actors Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow have gelled
together on screen for a simple task: look hunky dory, sound like
bimbo's with intelligence.  They have succeeded very well on both
tasks.
Living in the small town of Florida, young lad Finn Bell (Ethan Hawke)
is asked to accompany the incredibly wealthy Ms. Nora Dinsmoor (Ann
Bancroft), a long time resident who lost her mind after a man left her
standing at the altar thirty years before.  Aged 8, Finn is
immediately attracted to Dinsmoor's 11 year old (and already stunning)
daughter Estella (Raquel Beaudene). Seizing the opportunity to share
some of her troubled wisdom, Dinsmoor warns: "She'll only break your
heart; it's a fact.  And even though I warn you, even though I
guarantee you that the girl will only hurt you terribly, you'll still
pursue her. Ain't love grand?"
Through emotional and sexual seduction, Estella's power over Finn
grows until their off and on relationship hits the boundaries of time
and location.  Now into adult hood, Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) moves to
New York after a rousing night with Finn (Ethan Hawke).  Years later,
a mystery benefactor suddenly requests Finn to showcase his talent for
drawing (of which was nothing more than a hobby) and make himself
known in the art world.  Off he goes to New York, and can you guess
who he bumps into?
The reunion of these two characters brings forth some rather
surprising results, and as the film begins to wrap up we are able to
appreciate the love story that has kept us interested all this time.
With a surprisingly dramatic climax, Great Expectations decides to
change its path of romance and love to a much more engaging finish
(even though this is only for a short time).  Sure - it's far from
perfect, but perfection isn't the name of the game - the film has a
sugary sweetness buried deep inside, which is eventually discovered
and appreciated.
The icy cold performance by Gwyneth Paltrow, and the puppy love role
that Ethan Hawke plays are quite obviously nothing special, but they
both look great together as a modern couple with a passion for
seduction.
Although Great Expectations may not be the most satisfying cinema
experience, it has more than enough bones in it's body to make it an
enjoyable feast of Generation X gibberish.

 What the hell happened to Great Expectations from the way of Charles Dickenson
to the Hollywood screenplay?
 This was not what I was forced to read in 9th grade.
 This version is about two twits falling in and out of love from their
childhood in Florida, to their adult lives in New York City.
 The only resemblence, aside from the young love, is the escaped convict who
befriends a boy in Florida.  The con is played by Robert De Niro, who, in his
total of four scenes, steals the entire picture under Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth
Paltrow's feets.
 In the `60s, a boy is forced to do housework for an aging drama queen at her
old, decaying mansion.  There he meets her niece, I believe, and they fall in
love, I believe.
 They go in and out of lust as teens,  til they both bump into each other in
NYC later on, he a rising artist, her, a business women.
 This film is under Paltrow's talents, while, it is basically just right for
Hawke.  De Niro, on the other hand, is great, but, the film is also below his
surface.
 A `90s, speeded up version of Dickenson, Great Expectations dashed all my
expectations of the film out the window.

Remember when you were a kid and went shopping for a Mothers Day gift at 
the drugstore? Your eyes would invariably land on the most elaborate 
package; a huge red velvet heart-shaped box of candy, with gold-edging, 
lace and ribbons. To a child, it was dazzling, but most adults recognized 
it as just a large, garish box of cheap sweets. "Great Expectations" is 
like that. Wildly ornate and covered with lace and ribbons, it 
desperately tries to look classy, but you quickly identify it for what it 
is; a great big heart-shaped box full of nothing.
Loosely based on the Charles Dickens classic, "Great Expectations" is 
aimed at romantics. Set in contemporary times, it strives to be a hip, 
tragic love story, but is so excessive and inept that it falls flat on 
its tortured little face. Ethan Hawke plays Finn, an artist raised by his 
sister's boyfriend (Chris Cooper) in a fishing village on Florida's Gulf 
Coast. As a boy, he once showed kindness to an escaped convict (Robert 
DeNiro) and never told anyone about the bizarre encounter. Shortly after, 
he was summoned to the decaying mansion of a rich, crazy old lady (Anne 
Bancroft,) where he became the designated playmate for her beautiful, 
snobby niece. Naturally, he immediately fell madly in love with the girl.
Cut to the 80s. Finn works as a commercial fisherman, burying his 
anguished memories of the lovely Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow,) who went away 
to school in Europe after rebuffing his advances again and again. Out of 
nowhere, a lawyer appears with a gift for the angst-ridden young man. 
Finn has a benefactor, who provides tickets to New York and everything 
Finn needs to break onto the city's art scene in grand fashion. 
Reluctantly, he heads for the Big Apple, where he finds wealth, success 
and, of course, the haughty Estella, now in the arms of another man. 
Visually, "Great Expectations" is a textbook example of art direction 
overkill. Every scene is dripping with chintzy style and framed to 
postcard perfection. Even the rotting mansion looks like the set for a 
MTV video, with glorious decay arranged oh-so-carefully to maximize the 
lush romanticism. Flocks of birds take off at just the right moments, 
while the overbearing soundtrack, a blend of thick strings and 
alternative rock, attempts to bully an emotional response from the viewer.
Of the many over-the-top visuals, the most outrageous comes midway 
through the film, as Finn walks the New York streets, devastated that 
Estella is flying away with her fiancee. Finn looks up at the clouds in 
the night sky, beautifully backlit by the moon. Suddenly, the camera 
sweeps upwards through the clouds to a computer generated airplane, 
whooshing right up to one of the plane's windows, where Estella gazes 
wistfully into the darkness. The scene is stunningly cheesy, so much so 
that one is almost tempted to admire the filmmakers for their sheer 
brazenness. Almost. Director Alfonso Cuaron's audacious style is 
certainly memorable, but that doesn't make it good.
And then there's the acting. You won't forget Anne Bancroft as the 
whacked-out Nora Dinsmoor. Bedecked in flowing dresses and enough make-up 
to embarrass Tammy Faye Bakker, Bancroft sweeps about the screen 
grotesquely, overacting while the camera takes every opportunity to focus 
on her wrinkles. She comes off like a drag queen doing a bad impression 
of Norma Desmond from "Sunset Boulevard." Robert DeNiro acquits himself 
nicely as the escaped convict, though it's hard to fathom why he agreed 
to perform in this trifle. 
Ethan Hawke spends the bulk of his screen time squinting with his mouth 
hanging open. In most scenes, he behaves as if he was struck in the head 
with a piece of lumber a few minutes earlier and is just beginning to 
regain his senses. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, there's not much to say. The 
centerpiece of the film is an extended scene where she poses in the nude 
for Finn. It's supposed to be haunting and erotic, but the effect is 
lessened because posing is only thing Paltrow does during the entire 
movie. Repeatedly, she strides into a scene, toys with Finn's emotions, 
then leaves abruptly. Paltrow does the abrupt exit bit so often that it 
becomes almost laughable. It's reminiscent of Elizabeth Berkley in 
"Showgirls," who left virtually every scene by spinning on her heels and 
walking off in a huff. The preening Estella may be beautiful, but Finn's 
devotion to this aloof ice queen just makes him seem obsessive and 
shallow. 
"Great Expectations" is a mess, a lurid romance with flashy imagery 
substituting for genuine emotion. Rent the superb 1946 version of 
Dickens' story from your video store and stay away from this oversized, 
overwrought heart-shaped box of goo.

20th Century Fox / 1:51 / 1998 / R (langauge, violence, muted sex)
Cast: Ethan Hawke; Gwyneth Paltrow; Anne Bancroft; Robert De Niro; Chris 
Cooper; Hank Azaria; Josh Mostel; Jeremy James Kissner; Raquel Beaudene 
Director: Alfonso Cuaron 
Screenplay: Mitch Glazer 
Studio expectations must not have been high for "Great Expectations" -- 
the film's release date was pushed from late December to late January at 
what appeared to be the last minute, therefore putting any Academy 
Awards chances it has off until this time in 1999. It's actually a smart 
move, because while this updated take on the Charles Dickens tale isn't 
quite Oscar fodder, it *is* strong enough to be distinguished from the 
cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six 
weeks of any given year. "Great Expectations" also demonstrates how to 
modernize a classic story right, especially after the excruciatingly 
wretched excesses of Baz Luhrmann's "William Shakespeare's Romeo + 
Juliet." 
"Great Expectations" opens somewhere in 1970s Florida (the original 
story is set in 19th-century England), as eight-year-old Finn (Jeremy 
James Kissner) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on 
his life in the future. There's icy, 11-year-old Estella (Raquel 
Beaudene), a pseudo-playmate of Finn's; Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), 
Estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never 
took off; and a mysterious prisoner (Robert De Niro) whom Finn saves the 
life of. Finn, who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend (Lone 
Star's Chris Cooper), fancies himself an aspiring artist, and proves his 
prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of Estella using only Ms. 
Dinsmoor's lipstick, eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her 
dilapidating mansion. 
Flash forward into the '90s (after a brief stop in the '80s), and Finn 
(now played by Ethan Hawke), despondent over a strange hot-and-cold 
relationship with the elusive Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), receives quite 
a bit of money from an unknown benefactor; it's enough cash to send him 
to New York to focus on a career in art. There, Finn seems to gain 
everything he could ever want -- wealth, prestige and a high place in 
the glamorous art world. When Estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof 
fiancé (Hank Azaria) -- Finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual 
attraction. But she's not the only ghost from Finn's past that's going 
to be paying him a visit. 
Comparisons with the afore-mentioned "Romeo + Juliet" seem inevitable 
since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic 
drama into a current setting. "Great Expectations" is a much better 
venture, though, because it treats its source with even-handed respect, 
where "Romeo" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof, a homage or 
both. The movie is a visual banquet thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's sexy 
cinematography; notably, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between 
the two leads with a luscious, erotic charge that's steamier than the 
film's (surprisingly muted) love scenes. The eclectic rock soundtrack 
compliments the on-screen action beautifully, especially new songs by 
Tori Amos, Mono and Duncan Sheik. 
Acting credits are first-rate, often hiding the screenplay's occasional 
slip-ups. Hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man (something we also 
learned from "Gattaca"), and his Finn is quite a likeable guy. Paltrow's 
Estella, on the other hand, is rather underdeveloped. While the actress 
is at her icily seductive best, we're not told very much about her 
character, and as a result, it's often hard to understand why Finn would 
appreciate her beyond a physical level (but, oh, *what* a physical 
level); sometimes, we root for Finn although we don't quite understand 
why she's fueling his fire. Robert De Niro is nice and sophisticated in 
the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play; on the other end of 
the acting spectrum is Bancroft, a macabre, throaty delight who mambos 
and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make Norma 
Desmond jealous. 
Alfonso Cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the 
dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax. 
Another problem is predictability; you can guess your way through the 
plot even if you aren't familiar with the story. Despite its script 
flaws, though, "Great Expectations" is undeniably romantic without being 
corny or gloppy. And frankly, it's nice to see a film that embraces 
softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality. Perhaps that 
renovated release date, awfully close to Valentine's Day, will end up 
helping "Great Expectations"' seemingly average box office chances after 
all.

My rule of viewing a film adaptation of a classic novel is this: grade it
as a film, and any changes it makes to the novel either work or don't work
on how they relate to the film.  For instance, the 1984 film adaptation of
Orwell's "1984" is good not because it's very much like the novel, but
because it brings the themes and general misery along with it.  And
Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" is great because it's
great, and not bad because it doesn't adhere by the book (it's basically
"Kubrick's 'The Shining'").
"Great Expectations," based on the novel by Charles Dickens apparently has
very little to do with the novel.  I used "apparently" because I read the
book when I was a high school freshman (didn't we all?), and my
recollection of it consists of this: there was a guy named Pip, a girl
named Estella, a woman named Miss Havisham, and a criminal named Magwich. 
That's it.  It's also another in the line of the modern-day retelling
films, like '96's "Romeo + Juliet," which I actually liked (yeah, stone
me).  I felt that "Romeo + Juliet" brought out all the themes in the
original play (well, most of 'em anyway), and was indeed tragic without
becoming melodramatic (much like the play).  Basically all "Great
Expectations" has to do is be good on its own, and maybe even hit upon some
nerves not usually uncovered in the novel.
But somewhere something went wrong.  Somewhere the cool modern-day style by
director Alfonso Cuarón (who did the greatly-received but little-seen "A
Little Princess") and the modern-day retelling part didn't work together. 
The film got too much into telling the love story part of the story, which,
as I recall, is not the only thing that happened in the book.  I don't
remember many of the themes that abounded throughout, but I do remember
that it was not a melodramatic, annoying love story.  The two in the story
came together at the end, I believe, because of some deeper notions, not
because it just had to.  Somehow, everything meant a little more in the
novel.
Anyway, the story revolves around a guy named Finn (Ethan Hawke when he's
older), instead of Pip (Why?  Is Finn more "modern" than Pip?), who lives
in Florida with his uncle Joe (Chris Cooper), and one day goes over to the
decaying, weed-ridden mansion of a crazy millionairess, Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne
Bancroft, acting like Mrs. Robinson gone crazy after 30 years), instead of
Miss Havisham.  While there, he runs into a little snobbish girl, Ms.
Dinsmoor's niece, Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow when she's older), and soon
Dinsmoor has hired Finn to come play with her every week for almost a
decade, even though the two are distanced a bit.  But there's always some
sexual chemistry between the two.
Soon Finn has fallen hard for Estella, and after a little bit of, um,
fooling around, Estella coldly shuns him and ends up moving to Paris,
sending Finn into a pit of depression.  But after years of not seeing her,
he moves to New York to pursue a career in painting, as he was quite the
painter as a child.  Finn soon finds himself in the pit of the 90s art
world, and because of a mysterious benefactor, has become huge all of a
sudden, given a gallery and everything.  And, of course, Estella's in New
York too, and, of course, she's engaged to an aristocrat (Hank Azaria).
But the sexual chemistry between the two is still there, and the two do
fool around a bit, and in one scene, Estella comes over to pose for
him...in the buff.  But she keeps taunting him, then breaking his heart by
shunning him out of the blue.  After sleeping with him in one scene, he
finds out she has gotten married in the next.  Are these two really in love
but their pasts keep interfering?  Was she conditioned by Ms. Dinsmoor to
shun Finn just like her fiance 30 years did by standing her up at her
wedding, thus driving her into a drunken state of insane depression?  Is
Estella trapped by all this, conflicted over her love for Finn and the fact
that she feels she must  continually diss him?
All of this is taken into account, but none of it is ever really rectified.
 It's all show in sequences where there's confessions, like in one scene
where Finn asks Estella "What's it like to not ever feel anything?" and she
gives a long speech about how someone who's been brought up like that can
never turn against it - like she's trapped or something.  But the film
never really explores it any deeper than having characters step out of
themselves to explain themes in a condescending way.  The narration by Finn
is way over-written: it states each of the problems and theories without
ever letting the viewer come up with them on their own, thus cancelling
them out.  Although it could be argued that due to the surreal nature of
the film, many people would be lost, it just makes for a melodramatic film.
 And special scenes, like one where Finn gives a confessional to who he
thinks is Estella in the rain (for sheer camp value, I just wanted him to
rip off his shirt, get down on his knees, and scream at the top of his
lungs "ESTELLA!!!") ends in a cheap twist that's supposed to heartbreaking,
but for some reason seems crap.
But at the same time, there are some redeeming qualities.  The best thing
about this, to me anyway, is the style and direction by Cuarón, who gives
the film a cool surreal feel.  The cinematography in this film is
outstanding, as are the set designs, especially the awe-inspiring
presentation of the Dinsmoor mansion, which is covered in vines and weeds. 
Cuarón works well with his camera, pulling off some truly nifty camera
tricks, such as some impressive steadicam work, and mastering the fading
(the nude posing scene is even more impressive in that you never see
Paltrow naked - it always fades her naughty bits out).  And there are some
truly cinematic moments, most notably a scene (or actually scenes) where
Dinsmoor dances wildly to "Besame Mucho."
But the surrealism doesn't work well with the film, which focuses way too
much on the love story.  "Great Expectations" is not one of the great love
stories; it was more of a coming-of-age tale, and getting over the past. 
Sure, it points out at the end that the past is just the past, and that
memories are things we must get over, but it never seems to really get to
that point.  It gets there because it has to; not because it actually got
there by way of storytelling.  By singling in on this section of the story,
it alienates itself from the other subplots, such as Finn's relationships
with Dinsmoor, Joe, and most notably, with the criminal Lustig (Robert
DeNiro), instead of Magwich, who he helps escape in the beginning, and who
comes back later in the story.  Of all the parts of the film, this is the
one that feels the most edited.  When tragedy strikes these two, we're not
sure what to think because it hasn't even been backed up so well, which
also affects a twist which seems cheap and unsurprising (it was the
opposite in the novel...I think).
And poor Ethan...he's saddled with the tough job of playing the boring
protagonist while all around him are interesting characters.  He does a
good job, especially in a scene where he confesses to another character
that his heart is truly broken, even if it is for revenge (even I almost
shed a tear).  Hawke is one of the finest of the Gen-X actors; he's better
than this.  Paltrow exhibits great seduction with her character, but shows
some human elements broadening her character (alas this is really not
resolved).  Bancroft and DeNiro are priceless in their respective
underwritten roles, while Cooper and Azaria are also very good in even more
underwritten roles (who else can stutter as well as Azaria?).
The result is a disappointing film which is neither romantic nor poignant,
but instead feels like Cliffs Notes on acid.  The problem is not that it
doesn't follow the book (which it doesn't), but that it instead tries to
tell a melodramatic story about people we barely care about if they weren't
being portrayed by such cool actors.  The writing of the film tries to
downtalk to its core audience, who may eat it up, but will eventually spit
it out like it should be, but line up for the next cute film just like this
(maybe an adaptation of "Tale of Two Cities" starring Leo DiCaprio and
Sandra Bullock...).

Director: Alfonso Cuaron
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Chris Cooper, Anne
Bancroft, Robert De Niro
Rated R: Language, sexuality
by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
    This is one of those extremely rare cases in which I have actually
read the source text from which a film is based. Dickens' Great
Expectations was one of the books that I decided might be worth my time
in high school (though I was wary after David Copperfield). I was
pleasantly surprised by the novel, which I found to be an entertaining
and very insightful look into the growth of one young boy named Pip.
    The film version, for all who have not seen the preview, is a
modernization of the story. Finn is the name of the character, and he is
valiantly played by Ethan Hawke. The film opens in Florida and we are
introduced to Finn (as a child, played by Jeremy James Kissner) in the
famous scene with the escaped convict, played by Robert De Niro. Finn
brings the convict food out of the goodness of his heart, but the
convict is captured anyway. Later, we meet Finn's stepfather, Joe (Chris
Cooper); Finn helps Joe with his day-to-day labor, and it becomes clear
that, despite their lower-class living, they are at least somewhat
content with their lives.
    One day, Finn gets a call from the richest woman in Florida, Mrs.
Dinsmore (Ms. Havisham in the book); she wants Finn to come and
entertain her with his artistic talents. When he arrives at her home, he
finds an eccentric, possibly psychotic, woman (Anne Bancroft) who lives
in a great big, run-down house with her niece, Estella. The film takes
off from there, going through the many love battles between Estella and
Finn; Finn later ends up in New York as a successful artist, still
trying to win Estella's love.
    What I found most fascinating about the film is how close director
Alfonso Cuaron came to creating the same images that I pictured as I
read the book. Given that the book is from a different time period, I
find this amazing. The cinematography and production design are truly
striking, most notably in the scenes depicting Mrs. Dinsmore's lavishly
decadent home. The courtyard in front of the house, ornamented with
overgrown trees and vines; the rooms indoors, devoid of furniture but
full of empty space--the locations in this film feel detached from time,
as if we could look back on them in ten or thirty or one hundred years
and they will all be the same.
    I also think Hawke is the perfect choice to play Finn. Hawke has the
kind of strength that this character needs, and he is capable of letting
the audience know that a lot of what he does is just for show, that he
isn't as strong and sure of himself as he seems. Ironically, this
performance is not as powerful as I was expecting. The scenes in which
he is drawing Estella are very well-done; sometimes, however, when he
gets into situations in which he has to speak softly and be subtle, he
drops the ball and makes some lines sound silly.
    Gwyneth Paltrow plays Estella as an adult, and she does a great job
in the role (though I pictured the character to look entirely
different). I could see how some may say that she's one-dimensional, and
often purely cruel, but Paltrow conveys just the right amount of inner
torture, and it becomes clear that what she does to Finn is not out of
spite, but out of habit. Supporting performances from Anne Bancroft,
Chris Cooper, Hank Azaria, and Robert De Niro are all unique and
colorful, and add a lot of life to the film.
    Like all films, this one is not perfect. I wouldn't say that it
doesn't live up to the book, because I think in many ways it does. What
the film does that doesn't feel quite right is that it centers far too
much on the relationship between the characters and not enough on just
what Finn is doing and thinking in his life. It gets almost repetitive
at times, and I found myself saying, "Okay, so he's going to get screwed
again here," and I nearly became detached from the story a couple times.
    There are some truly brilliant scenes, though. My favorite in the
film is probably the one in which Finn storms into a restaurant,
approaches Estella, and says, "Would you like to dance?" with her
fiancée sitting right there. After dancing for a few seconds, he takes
her outside in the rain and they share a moment of passion--followed by
sex, of course.
    Great Expectations is thick on atmosphere and character, and in the
end I found it to be an effective film. Unlike the cinematic tragedy of
William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Cuaron has successfully updated a
classic tale, and, despite a few flaws in content and story
concentration, the result is an intelligent, insightful picture that
both fans of the book and those not familiar with it can enjoy.

20th Century Fox; rated R (brief nudity, language, sensuality); 111 minutes
Screenplay: Mitch Glazer (adapted from the novel by Charles Dickens)
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwenyth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Chris Cooper, Hank Azaria,
Robert DeNiro, Josh Mostel, Nell Campbell, Kim Dickens.
Like William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, from 1996, Great Expectations takes
a classic story and envisions it in modern terms.  Unlike Baz Lurhmann's wild
and 
romantic film though Great Expectations is not a success. 
Faithful readers of the Dickens novel will no doubt be horrified with the
multitude of changes made.  The film plays so fast and loose with its source
material it is likely to inspire comparisons with the failed 1995 film version
of The Scarlet Letter.  I, however, am not a Dickens fan and I would warmly
welcome an attempt to turn any of his works into a modern, fun, movie.
Unfortunately, this film turns out to be as much fun as reading the novel.
For awhile the film hooks you.  The production design, costume design,
cinematography, and musical score and soundtrack are undeniably gorgeous.  If
not an exciting film, Great Expectations is certainly a beautiful film to look
at.
The film opens with young Finn (changed from Pip in the book) informing us he
will not "tell the story the way it happened" and will instead "tell the story
the way I remember it."  While on an outdoor excursion in his Florida fishing
village Finn happens across a wanted criminal who is hiding out under water
(mostly so Robert DeNiro, who portrays the criminal, can have a flashy
entrance).  After a brief experience in helping the criminal he is caught
again and Finn returns to his normal life.
He is then taken, by his Uncle Joe (Chris Cooper), to the dilapidated mansion
of the richest woman in town Ms. Dinsmoore (Anne Bancroft, inviting
comparisons to a drag queen).  After locking eyes with a beautiful but icy
young girl on the grounds Finn is swept away as quickly as he arrived.  Upon
their return home though they find his older sister (Kim Dickens) on the phone
with Dinsmoore.  Apparently the woman will pay a handsome fee if young Finn
will spend his Saturday afternoons entertaining that mysterious young girl at
the mansion.
Eager to see the young beauty again Finn quickly agrees and is soon swept into
a world of Dinsmoore's madness and the hot and cold nature of young Stella.
Time passes, Finn and Stella grow up into Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, and
Stella soon disappears to Europe.  Finn is heartbroken and gives up his
passion for artwork to work the ocean with Uncle Joe.
After more time passes Finn receives a gift from a mysterious benefactor which
allows him to travel to New York and start up his painting again.  In New York
he runs into Stella and old passions are brought to the surface.  However,
Stella is now engaged to wimpy Walter Reed (Hank Azaria wasting time in a
meaningless role) and is still cold enough to deny true feelings for Finn but
hot enough to pose nude for him (following in the oddly fast growing tradition
of Kate Winslet in Titanic (1997) and Helen Hunt in As Good As It Gets
(1997)).
The focus of this version of Great Expectations remains almost exclusively on
the anti-romance between Finn and Stella.  There is time taken out for Finn's
overnight success in the New York art world and for bookend appearances by the
DeNiro character.  However what we have mostly is a film about an emotionally
disturbed woman and the lap dog in love with her.
Hawke and especially Paltrow do a fine enough job with their performances but
it's hard to establish a relationship with their empty characters.  Of all the
characters only Chris Cooper's Uncle Joe seems to have an emotional depth to
him.
To be fair there are some stunningly romantic sequences.  A first kiss over a
water fountain that is later repeated is strongly erotic both times and a
scene where Finn ditches his first gallery show to sweep Stella off her feet
provides a real romantic rush.  After this though we're left with characters
who are completely at odds with each other and the romantic scenes are given a
sort of uncomfortable aftertaste.
In the end what we have is a pretty but vapid film that reaches for a timeless
passion that simply isn't present in its story.

I swear, if I weren't such an incurable romantic I would hate all the movies
out there. Yes, I'll admit I loved "The English Patient" more than life
itself, and yes, I would see a romantic comedy over a B-rate action flick
any day of the week. Those are the reasons I forgave the shortcomings of
Great Expectations.
The movie in and of itself is an attempt to be artsy, a loose modernization/
adaptation of the Dickens classic (which I hate), with almost every
character re-named and remoded into whatever fits. With Pip renamed as Finn
and re-casted as an artist and Robert de Niro taking on the role of the
felon Magwitch, re-dubbed Lusting. The only thing seemingly kept the same is
the basics, the name Estella for Finn's lifelong love, and the basic Marxist
theme to the entirety of it.
It basically succeeds as an artsy film, making a appealing version of the
classic, but the re-naming of the characters, the choppy dialogue and the
write-your-script-in-a-three-day-weekend contest winner script make a
complete lack of appeal. Go ahead and see it, you probably will find
yourself enjoying the movie. But, whatever you do, don't try to watch the
movie to do that book report.

Director: Alfonso Cuaron
Producer: Art Linson
Screenplay: Mitch Glazer based on the novel by Charles Dickens
When one thinks of GREAT EXPECTATIONS, one thinks of Pip not Finn; Miss
Havisham who incinerates herself in her wedding dress, not a remorseful
Ms Dinsmoor who regrets what she has done; a vindictive, cold Estella
who is unable to love and mostly an unhappy ending.
 The original story may have been a miserable tale about an orphan and a
bratty girl, but that's how Dickens wanted it. Recreating Dickens 90's
style is a dangerous thing. Can we safely say that this is still
Dickens?
Although the jist of the story is much the same, there are elements
which make this story subtly different. Minor annoyances like how Finn's
sister sleeps around then leaves them. A seductive Estella who
eventually mellows into a human being and the implication that Finn and
Estella fall in love in the end, may be enough to make Dickens turn in
his grave. It is as ludicrous as rewriting ROMEO AND JULIET so they live
happily ever after, then still calling it Shakespeare!
If this story were not so closely tied with Dickens, then perhaps it
would not be receiving such harsh criticism. Ethan Hawke is a
charismatic actor and good in his role as Finn, although better in
GATTACA. The seductive Estella, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, works the
camera with looks that could kill. Anne Bancroft is delightful as the
eccentric Ms Dinsmoor, reminiscent of Gloria Swanson in SUNSET
BOULEVARD. Whilst Robert De Niro's puts in a heartfelt performance as
the escaped convict who brings fortune to the young Finn.
Playing around with classical literature is a dangerous thing,
especially if you're going to change the ending.

As an English teacher, I'm sure this is one film you've been waiting
for. Like "Clueless" and "Romeo & Juliet," "Great Expectations" is
another modern update of a classic novel. I think, however, this is
the far weaker effort of the three.
 The story somewhat follows Charles Dickens' 19th century classic,
right down to the happy ending. But like the other two films, this
version is aimed at the Gen X set, who will end up thinking of this as
the version of record rather than the original on their must-read book
list in high school English class.
My freshman English teacher, Ms. Weinstock, may not like this version
either, barely reminiscent of David Lean's traditional classic 1946
film. This is the fourth feature film version of "Great Expectations,"
but the memorable names have all been changed for some reason by
screenwriter Mitchell Glazer. I remember Ms. Weinstock spent an entire
class demonstrating the importance of Dickens characters' names as
irony. I wish Glazer attended that class.
Dickens' protagonist Pip, which means small seed, made sense since the
novel follows Pip's growth into manhood.  The mysterious Miss
Havisham, conniving and misleading, is literally Having-a-sham against
young Pip.
Throw all of that out the window here. Ethan Hawke plays Finn Bell
(Pip), Anne Bancroft is Ms. Nora Dinsmoor (Miss Havisham), Chris
Cooper is Joe Coleman ("Uncle" Joe Gargery) and Robert De Niro is
Arthur Lustig (Abel Magwitch), an escaped convict who befriends Pip,
ahem, Finn as a 10 year old. Only Finn's love interest, Estella, has
the same name with Gwyneth Paltrow starring. Even attorney Mr. Jaggers
has become Mr. Ragnow.
The focus is clearly on the alluring combination of Hawke and Paltrow
as they exchange glances between a pounding Patrick Doyle score and
songs by Tori Amos and Pulp. "Great Expections' " greatest
contribution will be in CD sales, rather than book sales.
Director Alfonso Cuaron's second American feature is also his second
consecutive remake. That's originality for you. Cuaron debuted in 1995
with "A Little Princess," the remake of "The Little Princess" with
Shirely Temple in 1939.
In this version, orphan Finn Bell (Jeremy James Kissner, at 10) is
startled one day while drawing along the Florida Gulf coast. Lustig
rises out of the water and threatens Finn's life if he doesn't return
with food and bolt cutters for his shackled legs.
The next day Finn is called to the mansion of Ms. Dinsmoor, an
eccentric old hermit who was jilted on her wedding day. Dinsmoor's
niece is the beautiful, young Estella, a bossy snob,who calls Finn,
"the gardener." Finn makes regular visits to the broken-down Dinsmoor
mansion.Finn falls in love.
As revenge, Dinsmoor has taught Estella how to be the ultimate tease,
a real man killer. The worst kind of woman in my book, the type that
knows they're gorgeous, uses it, and then dumps all over you when you
show the least bit of interest. A black widow spider comes to mind,
without the culminating murder.
When a grown-up Finn is approached by a lawyer, preparing to make all
of Finn's wishes come true, Finn is led to believe that his secret
benefactor is Ms. Dinsmoor.
Suddenly, Finn is flying to New York City to make his entry into the
high-profile art world. Estella has already left for school in Europe.
Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki tries hard, but too often Finn is
running or walking through downpours along Big Apple sidewalks. At
least he looks good, but there is little chemistry between Finn and
Estella and for all the beautiful shots, the film lacks charm, energy
and heart.
Lean's film version won a best cinematography Oscar for Guy Green.
A needless voice-over narration provided by Hawke's Finn doesn't
help. Hank Azaria enters the picture as stiff-shirt Walter, Estella's
boyfriend, replacing Dickens' Bentley Drummle from the novel.
You'll have to judge for yourself, though, just so you know what your
students are talking about in class.

(Ms. Dinsmoor), Robert De Niro (Lustig)
Sympathetic press to the contrary notwithstanding, this film is
really just awful -- not merely flawed, but a really lousy piece
of filmmaking.  Its awfulness is made all the worse because it
feels slightly smug, as though it thinks it's important, artsy --
an achievement.  And that's a serious problem, because with this
sense of its own importance, it brings in all sorts of art film
baggage to call attention to itself -- expressionist lighting,
slow, laborious dialogue, overacting.  it leaves us with a mess
that's really only watchable because of its absurdity; one can
sit back and admire the scenery (and there is some lovely scenery)
without feeling the pressure of having a real cinematic
experience.
The story is, of course, loosely based on the novel by Charles
Dickens.  Like the novel, it opens with an initially frightening
encounter between an impoverished child (Finnegan Bell, played
here by Jeremy James Kissner) and an escaped criminal, Lustig
(Robert De Niro).  Finn is an orphan, and lives with his sister
and her husband in a squalid little town in Florida -- but he
has dreams of being an important artist one day.  He is
accosted by Lustig one afternoon while he's sitting in a small
rowboat in the bay, drawing pictures of birds and fish.  Lustig
emerges abruptly from underwater and induces Finn to fetch him
some bolt cutters and food.  Finn does as he's asked, and what's
more, he distinguishes himself by bringing along some whiskey.
Finn also goes above and beyond the call a bit later; as he
tries to help Lustig escape, his boat is accosted by a police
boat.  Lustig abandons ship -- and Finn, instead of simply
fleeing with the police, tosses the escapee a life jacket.
De Niro is fairly effective in this sequence (though it's
hardly outstanding work), and Kissner makes a fair showing;
so far so good.
Things go downhill fairly quickly, however, when we move to the
next sequence -- young Finn's first encounter with Estella (Raquel
Beaudene) and her crazed but affluent guardian, Miss Dinsmoor (Anne
Bancroft).  Estella and Miss Dinsmoor live in a decrepit old mansion
by themselves; Finn meets Estella while his own guardian is doing
some sort of delivery there.  Estella seems to take a reluctant
interest in Finn at first glance -- leading Miss Dinsmoor to invite
him to visit on a weekly basis, which he does for many, many years.
The visuals in this sequence are striking -- both the exterior and
the interior of Miss Dinsmoor's mansion are lavishly created and
well-filmed, which makes the dramatic flaccidly of these scenes
stand out all the more.  The weak link here is Bancroft's
performance, which is outlandish and laughable rather than sinister,
which seems to be what Cuaron was shooting for.  She prances about
to various versions of "Besame Mucho," occasionally muttering
things like "shika-boom" and fondling young Finn in a rather
suggestive way.  She also finds time to issue a warning to Finn:
"Don't fall for her.  She'll only hurt you."
Unfortunately for him and for us, Finn doesn't seem to listen, so
we get another 90 minutes or so of what is, more or less, a love
story.  We jump ahead a few years to watch Finn as a young man (a
slack-jawed Ethan Hawke) get teased, then summarily dumped by
Estella (an icy Gwyneth Paltrow).  Finn is heartbroken, and gives
up on his dreams -- of becoming an artist, and of ever escaping
the poverty of his community.  He stays there, learning to accept
his fate, when a lawyer appears on his doorstep, offering him a
ticket to the New York, art world -- money and a gallery show, a
gift from an anonymous donor.  Finn accepts what he assumes is
Miss Dinsmoor's generosity and heads north, where he finds a
receptive audience for his work.  He also finds Estella, on the
cusp of an engagement; he manages to seduce her, but the
seduction doesn't take, and she again moves out of his life.
I won't reveal the ending here, in case there's someone out
there who didn't have to read the Dickens novel in high school;
suffice it to say, everything wraps itself up in a rather
Dickinsian way.
Throughout it all, we're subjected to acting that ranges from
ridiculously overdone (Bancroft) to unreadably passive (Paltrow)
to aimless (Hawke).  Hawke and Paltrow, both fairly sexy
commodities in their own right, don't really seem to turn each
other on; they never manage to work up any credible chemistry.
The script is bland and directionless.  In the end, all we're
really left with are some fine visuals by Emmanuel Lubezki
(known for his work in _Like Water for Chocolate_ and _A Walk
in the Clouds) and some impressive artwork by Francesco Clemente
(who creates all the work attributed to Finn).  These are no
small pleasures, and if you're in the mood for a purely visual
experience, this film does have something to offer you.  I'd
recommend bringing along your Sony Discman and a pair of
headphones, though.

          PSB "He didn't remember how it really happened so he distorted the facts and twisted the truth. I implemented the same technique when I wrote the essay question in 9th grade English. Not because I couldn't remember, but because I didn't read the book"
          PSB "Wait, don't go away mad. There were some good parts.  Emmanuel Lubezki did a great job with the photography and the sets were very well done. It was visually pleasing.
          PSB "Right. Estella was still stony cold. She didn't tell Finn that she had no heart and no sympathy sentiment nonsense', but she did walk out of the room after letting Finn digitally investigate her"
          PSB "Yeah. And Finn still has a surprisingly absent lack of will and ability to control his own destiny. It didn't, however, give me the same feeling about Finn expecting Dinsmoor to eventually give' Estella to him. It was just sappy Hollywood romance bull-shit"

*** (out of 4) If you didn't understand English, this would be a great movie
to see anyway. The cinematography is outstanding. It is fluid and graceful,
enamored and lightheaded. At times the widescreen shots are composed to
resemble the main character's paintings. And within each shot is a fully
textured world of birds or moss or art. 
Against the swampy Florida setting is the modernized retelling of Charles
Dickens' story about a poor young man with a wealthy benefactor. 
Ten-year old Finn (Jeremy James Kissner) grows up visiting his friend and
tormentor Estella Dinsmoor (Raquel Beaudene) once a week. Actually, it's
Estella's eccentric aunt (Anne Bancroft) who requests, and pays for, his
presence each week. Finn uses the money to keep him in sketch books, paints
and brushes. 
Mrs. Dinsmoor asks young Finn what he thinks of Estella. "I think she's a
snob," he replies. "I also thinks she's pretty." Mrs. Dinsmoor warns him at
the age of 10 to be careful about falling for Estella. "She'll only break
your heart, it's a fact," she says. 
When they reach high school, very close to graduation, Estella (now Gwynneth
Paltrow) complains to her aunt that she doesn't have a date for a big party.
Finn (now Ethan Hawke) still has a crush on her and gallantly volunteers for
the job. Afterwards, in one of those dizzying displays of passionate
cinematography, the shy and awkward Finn ALMOST wins the girl of his dreams.
Before he knows what's happening and before anything CAN happen, she is out
of his house, out of the country, and out of his life. Mrs. Dinsmoor's
prediction came true.  
Six years of Finn's life zip by. Disillusioned, he gives up on girls and on
painting, choosing instead a life of fishing with his uncle Joe (Chris
Cooper, recently in LONE STAR). 
The story picks up again when Mr. Ragno (Josh Mostel), a lawyer, approaches
Finn. Ragno is acting on behalf of a wealthy benefactor who wishes to remain
nameless, and who offers Finn a New York studio and a one-man show of his
work. After a quick stop to carefully thank Mrs. Dinsmoor, he is off to the
big city. 
In New York, Finn runs into Estella. Finn finds he STILL has a crush on her,
and when she agrees to model for him, he is ecstatic. The scene of him
sketching her is another one of those unabashed sequences of passionate
cinematography. As before, Estella abruptly walks out the door before
anything can happen. 
Turns out she already has a boyfriend. Walter (Hank Azaria) is wealthy and
therefore, in Finn's mind, better deserving of Estella's affections. When
she tells Finn that she's getting married, she  practically dares him to
object, but Finn still feels like he hasn't EARNED his fame, or the ability
to make her a better offer. If either of them were more forthright, they
might make each other happy, but their natures and their different-class
upbringings work against them. 
I haven't read the book, but the story seems to follow the original pretty
closely (based on a comparison with David Lean's more conventional
adaptation, and on other reviews). The modernizations actually improved the
story. For example, in the original, Pip (renamed Finn) is sponsored not as
an artist but as a monied gentleman. By giving the character a vocation
rather than a status, screenwriter Mitch Glazer makes him more approachable.
Glazer also made Estella's rejection of Finn less cruel and more
situational. That may have diminished our understanding of Estella's aunt,
but the movie is better off with two characters than with a hero and a
villainess. 
A friend of mine criticized the movie for trying to be too artsy, but I
disagree. Cuarón portrayed the New York art scene with just enough derision
to make it clear that he wasn't going to bow to it. For example, at a party
there is a wandering opera singer, as irksome as the wandering mariachi
bands in schmaltzy Mexican restaurants. In Finn's agent's gallery, the
current exhibit is belly art: human bellies poking through holes in white,
square pillars. I can't remember when I've laughed so hard as when I saw
that scene. 
The movie has a tidier ending than you might expect, and it doesn't seem to
quite fit. Then again, the original ending was unsatisfying in its own way,
so maybe nobody has figured out what the RIGHT ending is. (Dickens even
rewrote his own original ending at the urging of his friends). But the rest
of the story is wonderfully told and well structured. 
If you aren't familiar with the story, then the structure is particularly
interesting, especially toward the end. The film is highly recommended to
you. But even if you know the story, this adaptation is beautifully
photographed and lovingly decorated, and that is reason enough to recommend it.

I'll be the first to admit it.  When you mention the book Great
Expectations, I immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high
English class, where I was confronted with a torturously boring book
filled with people with such nonsensical names as Pip and Magwitch.
Yes, it's a classic of literature, but it was a rather dry one, shoved
down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine. Certainly, the
experience wasn't truly that bad, but, to quote Ethan Hawke in the
latest movie adaptation of said book, "I'm not going to tell the story
the way it happened...I'll gonna tell it the way I remember it." Anyway,
to return from nostalgia lane, and get back to the present, Hollywood,
in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics, now presents an
updated film version of Great Expectations.
Instead of Pip, this time the central character is named Finn (played as
a boy by Jeremy Kissner, and by Ethan Hawke as an adult).  Finn is an
orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister Maggie, or should that be
Mrs. Joe, (Kim Dickens), and her boorish fisherman husband, Joe (Chris
Cooper).  The setting is the Florida coast during the mid-70s.  Finn is
a blooming artist, and spends his time running around the beach drawing
fish (one of his two favorite subjects).
During one of these escapades, he literally stumbles upon an escaped
criminal (Robert DeNiro). Borrowing a page from the superhuman Max Cady,
DeNiro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity, and favors
hiding on the ocean floor.  OK...maybe that's an exaggeration, but he
certainly beats any of Houdini's records in the opening scenes of the
film.  And that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of Finn's
motorboat, but I digress.  Anyway, Finn does the convict a good deed,
just to show that he's a really swell guy. And then the plot moves on.
Enter Miss Havisham...or Ms. Dinsmoor here (Anne Bancroft).  Abandoned
at the altar some 26 years ago, Ms. Dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy
rich old maid. With bizarre clothing, eccentric mannerisms and a few
pounds of makeup, Anne Bancroft seriously overacts in this role.
Although she ends up nowhere near a believable character, she does add
some humor to the film. Joe is hired to help with the gardening at her
unkempt manner, but the insane Ms. Dinsmoor soon hires Finn to be a
plaything for her niece, Estella (Raquel Beaudene as a young girl,
Gwyneth Paltrow as an adult).
For no apparent reason, other than to provide the main plot of the film,
Finn is instantly stricken for the Estella.  Perhaps it's her snooty
attitude or her utter disdain for his person, or maybe Finn has simply
never met a girl before. In any case, neither as children nor adults,
chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two, and yet Finn spends the
remainder of the film pining for her.
Even when, as an adult, Finn arrives in New York at the behest of a
mysterious benefactor, reacquaints himself with Estella, and draws her
portrait in the nude, there's nothing.  In fact, there is more sexual
tension between Helen Hunt and  Greg Kinnear's gay artist during a
similar scene in As Good As It Gets. At this point, the audience has
grown as cold and detached as Estella's character, and couldn't care
less about the two characters.
The bulk of the blame here falls upon Gwyneth Paltrow.  She fails to
imbue Estella, a remote character in the book, with even the vaguest
traces of humanity.  There's obviously something wrong when, watching
the film, you're more interested with how big her nose looks in
silhouette than you are about her character. Without a strong Estella,
Finn's obsession seems baseless. You wish he would just stop whining,
let Estella marry his rival, Walter Plane (an oddly subdued Hank
Azaria), and just get on with his life.
In fact, the two relationships that work in the film are purely
tangential to the main plot.  Finn's relationship with his
brother-in-law, Joe, is interesting, if a bit stereotypical.  What's
more fascinating are his interactions with DeNiro.  Although it's only a
bit part, it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create.
It is apparent that director Alfonso Cuarsn put a lot of work in
creating the imagery of the film.  Some of the shots work, but others
are too obviously staged (for example, both of the water fountain
scenes) to have any impact.  Finn's art (actually the creations of
Italian painter, Francesco Clemente) is used throughout the film, but it
mostly fails to have the intended effect.  We never see why Finn would
generate this style of art, which is simultaneously crude and
insightful.  As a result, it ends up as distant as the rest of the film.
Modernizing the classics is currently in vogue (just see William
Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet).  Simply update the action to a modern
setting, and apply plenty of modern rock.  But such adornments do little
to perk up Great Expectations.  As much as I dreaded the novel when I
first read it, you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading
than watching this romanceless film.

   They say that what makes a classic is a work's ability to
transcend its own time period--to set out universal truths
about human nature. The trouble with that idea is that ALL
works assert concepts that go beyond their own eras.  So
then, what makes "Macbeth" universal is not the swordplay,
which mires it in its own time period, but its views on the
nature of politics and greed.  But if that's true, then why not
say that any soap opera is a classic since every story on
afternoon TV will undoubtedly deal with envy, lust, greed,
and/or revenge?
   In any case, "Great Expectations," which might look remote
from our time period (despite its reference to universal ideas)
if done as a museum piece, shows its timelessness in Mitch
Glazer's overhaul adaptation of the Charles Dickens story.  To
avoid tonguetwisters, even the names have been changed:
out with Magwitch, Miss Havisham and England; in with Pip
and Florida and New York.
   Name changes are not the principal difference between
Dickens's work and Mitch Glazer's script.  In perhaps his most
popular work, the 19th century author underscored the
changes that money engendered in the life of Pip, an orphan
and the unwanted ward of his harsh sister.  Brought up
lovingly by his brother-in-law, Joe--who manages to retain his
selfless affection for Pip--the young man is corrupted by
receipt of a large sum of money from an unknown source,
moving him from a poor cottage in England's marsh country
to the position of a London dandy.  He becomes a snob,
ashamed of his backwoods brother-in-law and uncomfortable
in his presence.  Ultimately finding out the identity of his
benefactor--whom he has assumed to be the fabulously rich
and vindictive Miss Havisham--he waxes older and wiser,
acknowledges Joe as the kind man who gave him so much
love when he was a boy, and thus redeemed is able once
again to pursue his childhood sweetheart.
   This scenario was for the most part honored by David
Lean's 1946, 4-star movie, considered by some one of the
greatest films ever made, unmatched by the 1974 revival
and the 1934 predecessor.  The current version highlights the
change which softened the radiant ice-princess now known as
Estella.  The niece of the fabulously rich and terminally dotty
Miss Dinsmore, Estella has been brought up to be like a
female Chad, the villainous yuppie in the remarkable 1997
movie, "In the Company of Men." Estella's mission in life is to
act seductively toward men until they fell in love with her, and
then to dump them.  She is a tease, the sort of woman known
in some circles by a more vulgar expression.  Since her aunt
had been left at the altar some 30 years earlier, a traumatic
experience which Miss Dinsmore never got over, the rich old
lady now uses her niece to extract vengeance against the
entire male gender.  When Dinsmore invites the 11-year-old
Finn to her lavish home, known as Paradiso Perduto, she
warns the handsome youth not to fall in love with Estella lest
he be terribly hurt by her in time.  Staggered by the kiss he
receives from the young Estella while both drink from a
fountain, Finn falls instantly in love and is determined to marry
this comely blond goddess.
   "Great Expectations" is certainly not the Masterpiece
Theater type of production one might expect from the title, but
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki pulls out the stops with
his exquisitely made production, which is designed with great
chic by Tony Burrough.  Directed by Alfonso Cuaron at an
appropriately relaxed pace, the narrative moves forward
insistently, albeit without many surprises, tracing the cycles of
life of its chief characters.  With many of Dickens's incidental
persons deleted in the interest of keeping the show under two
hours, Cuaron keeps the movie's theme uppermost in our
minds: how will the lives of Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke) and
Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) touch, part, and reunite?  The
movie features some dazzling scenes, particularly one in
which Estella visits Finn to pose for the artist's sketches,
strips completely to Finn's astonishment, and at the
conclusion of the session simply leaves without so much as a
touch.  In yet another erotically-charged display, Estella asks
Finn to take her out of a party and to his home, where she
seductively invites his embrace and once again suddenly
departs. The movie's opening scene--which in the David Lean
version is a knockout in an English graveyard--becomes a
scary one in the Florida waters as the 11-year-old Finn is
surprised by an escaped death-row convict, Lustig (Robert De
Niro) who swears Finn to secrecy and is helped by the lad in
his escape.
   Ann Bancroft's performance as the loopy Miss Dinsmore
overshadows the rest of the cast.  As a hermit in her
mansion--in which all clocks have been stopped to designate
the moment she was stood up at the alter--she dances with
her young guest like a flaky Auntie Mame, made up to appear
twenty years older as she alternately coaxes Finn to make
nice with her niece and alerts him to the dangers of such
courtship.  Ethan Hawke is no match for Bancroft.  Ideal for
the role of the spirited Vincent in "Gattaca," Hawke is too
limited to portray Finn's metamorphosis from backwoods
fisherman to art-world ingenue and is likewise swallowed by
the lovely, resonant performance of Gwyneth Paltrow as the
adult Estella.  De Niro's final scene in the New York subways
is even less believable than his initial foray in the Florida
waters, but Chris Cooper is adept as the kindly but decidedly
un-classy Joe.
   Francesco Clemente's drawings of Estella are among the
highlights of this generally opulent but somewhat strained and
sentimental rendering of the Dickens classic.  Rated R. 
Running Time: 111 minutes.  (C) 1998 by Harvey Karten

I've never read Charles Dicken's book Great Expectations. So, I walked into
the theatre with -- sorry -- no expectations of what the film would be like.
Great Expectations starts off somewhere in the 70s. Finn Bill is a 10 year
old orphan boy who lives with his sister and her boyfriend, Joe (Chris
Cooper). Estella is an orphaned 10-year-old girl who has been adopted by a
crazy old rich woman, Miss Dinsmore (Anne Brancroft). Miss Dinsmore is rich
but noticeably looney; she lives in her old mansion and mourns the day, 26
years ago, that her fiancé left her at the alter. Despite warnings from
Miss Dinsmore that Estella will only break his heart, Finn continues to see
Estella weekly.
Finn is a talented artist and he shows this early on in the film. His
drawing brings him to meet an escaped criminal, Lustig. Finn helps out
Lustig, but that story line ends as abruptly as it starts. Finn also draws
a portrait of Estella for Miss Dinsmore early on in the film.
A decade later, Estella is off studying abroad. Finn, who has retreated to
a quiet life as a fisherman with his Uncle Joe, is approached by a lawyer
representing a rich person who wants Finn to go to New York to exhibit his
art. Finn is, at first, resistant to the idea because he has long given up
being an artist, but at last he goes off to New York. He assumes that the
rich person financing his art show is Miss Dinsmore, but is it?
In New York, Finn bumps into Estella. Estella is thinking about marrying an
undecisive man named Walter Plane (Hank Azaria). And it is here that their
old love affair picks up. Finn is a very quiet person and Estella is an icy
cold tease. We are drawn into their relationship and never let go.
Ethan Hawke, doing an uncanny imitation of Tom Cruise, is very likeable in
Great Expectations. Hawke's Finn is spot on with the 10-year old version of
Finn as portrayed by Jeremy Kissner. Gwyneth Paltrow is sexy and icy cold
at the same time. Her Estella is hard to grasp and hard to figure out, but
that is what makes Estella so intriguing to watch. Robert DeNiro makes a
big impression as the escape convict Lustig. But the person who steals the
movie is Anne Brancroft as Miss Dinsmore. She is wonderfully crazy and a
joy to watch on screen. Worth mentioning is Chris Cooper as Uncle Joe. I
really liked the character Uncle Joe; he's a very down to earth and
understanding person.
What stands out in Great Expectations, even more than the wonderful
performances, is the cinematography. The movie simply looks ravishing. The
movie is lush with greens and the camera moves in sensuous ways. I love how
Great Expectations looks. Kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. 
Also worth mentioning is the artwork by Francesco Clemente. The artwork is
crude yet beautiful.
Great Expectations is a wonderful film with grand performances and a
stunning look. The movie follows the romance of two people from childhood
to adulthood. The story moves exceptionally well, though it starts out
stronger than it ends. Don't Miss Great Expectations in the theatres.

What do you suppose is the greatest form of energy?  What can take a
person further than one ever thought possible?  The answer is: Desire.
The desire that slowly brews within Finnegan [Finn] Bell (Ethan Hawke)
is the central focus of this poetic drama.   
When we first meet up with young Finn, we can see that he is a child
who roams freely without the heavy-handed guidance of most children
his age.  He spends his time hanging out at the fishing pier, wades
through the shallow waters of the Gulf, and scrawls his artwork into a
keepsake book.  As an incipient artist, he is truly gifted; like a
fish, he is free to do what he pleases.  But two acute episodes begin
to shape his future. 
One is a brief but traumatic encounter with an escaped convict (Robert
DeNiro).  The other happens when he meets Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow).
The movie spends most of its time focusing on these two.  Estella is
the embodiment of a cold-hearted soul that flaunts her sexuality as a
weapon of superiority and a catalyst of vengeance.  And we learn that
Estella's motivations are, in part, influenced by her eccentric
mother, the multimillionaire Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft).  Ms.
Dinsmoor was left standing at the alter many years ago and has been in
a continuous state of jilted mourning ever since.  Living alone in a
mansion that is quickly deteriorating and overrun with creepers, she
singles out Finn as the victim of her machinations.  She hates men,
and using Estella as the weapon, she will torment Finn as a means of
retaliation.  For starters, she teases Finn by telling him to not fall
in love with Estella, for she will break his heart.  But he does; he
is smitten, and Finn's long journey and subsequent transformation thus
begins.
For the most part, throughout his transformation process,  I enjoyed
the richness of the characters that Finn meets up with who subtly
impact his growth.  From the encounter with the convict to his
laid-back uncle to his frenzied art pals, each one contributes in
their own unique way.   Estella's detachment was haunting yet
bittersweet.  Also, Ms. Dinsmoor exuded a delicious blend of insanity
and wisdom who liked to listen to old records and end her sentences
with the words "Chick-e-boom".
Yet, there seemed to be something at work here that undermined the
allure set in the first half of the film.  Perhaps it was the fact
that we grew tired of watching Finn constantly adjust his lifestyle to
win over Estella.  Perhaps we were not convinced of Estella's
attraction for Finn.  Perhaps it was because we never really knew what
Estella was thinking.  Perhaps it was because the ending seemed
incongruously happy.  Moreover, as I was watched the film, the message
of the movie seemed to get buried behind the luscious cinematography
and beneath the bewitching musical score.  
It certainly seemed to have the potential to deliver a strong film.
But somewhere along the way, the story just ran out of steam.  Poetic
at some points and seemingly at a standstill at other points, I left
the theatre with many more questions than answers in my mind.  This is
not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, this is the kind of film that
leaves an impression in your mind as you walk out of the theatre.  For
me, however, I had higher expectations for this film, but what I got
was nothing great.

     You have to give a film maker credit for exhibiting the necessary 
chutzpah to take one of the most beloved classics in the English 
language, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS, and transform it into a 
modern-day morality play/romance.  Viewers who approach this motion 
picture with the mistaken expectation that it's going to be the kind of 
rigorously faithful adaptation that David Lean produced in 1946 are 
likely to be disappointed.  Nevertheless, while Alfonso Cuaron's GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS falls considerably short of being a definitive 
interpretation of the novel, it still offers an entertaining two hours.
     GREAT EXPECTATIONS is considered by many to be Dickens' finest 
novel.  It is certainly among his darkest, even with the less-downbeat 
ending that the author's friends prompted him to include.  Like OLIVER 
TWIST before it, GREAT EXPECTATIONS draws heavily from events in the 
writer's own life, which in part explains its believability and strength 
of character.  One of the book's chief themes  that of a poor boy 
crossing class barriers to pursue the girl of his dreams  offered Cuaron 
(A LITTLE PRINCESS) and writer Mitch Glazer their biggest challenge.  
With the setting changed from 19th century England to contemporary 
Florida and New York, the social scale of Victorian England lost its 
validity.  Surprisingly, however, the story survived the transition 
relatively unscathed.
     Even as the setting has changed, so have the names and occupations 
of many of the characters.  The lead is no longer Pip; he's now called 
Finn, and is played by Ethan Hawke (with an assist from Jeremy Kissner as 
a ten-year old).  Estella, the love of Finn's life, is still Estella, and 
she is portrayed by a radiant-yet-restrained Gwyneth Paltrow (and Raquel 
Beaudene at a younger age).  Mad Miss Havisham has become the equally 
deranged Miss Dinsmore, who spends her days in a ruined house mourning a 
wedding that never took place.  With Anne Bancroft in this part, it's 
easy to imagine that Nora Dinsmore could be Mrs. Robinson gone bonkers, 
thirty years later.  The criminal Magwich has become Lustig, an escaped 
death row inmate, and is essayed by Robert DeNiro, who leaves a stronger 
impression here than in the recent JACKIE BROWN.  Finally, Chris Cooper 
(LONE STAR) plays Finn's "uncle", Joe Gargery (no name change), and Hank 
Azaria is Walter Plane, Finn's rival for Estella.
     The story has Finn meeting Estella in the late 1970s, when both are 
ten years old.  Neither has any parents.  Finn lives with his sister and 
her boyfriend; Estella has been adopted by Miss Dinsmore, who, despite 
being insane, is one of the richest women in Florida.  Despite a warning 
from the old lady that Estella will break his heart, Finn falls for the 
golden-haired girl, but their relationship never progresses beyond wet 
kisses at a water fountain.  Finn is in earnest, but Estella likes to 
tease.  More than a decade later, they meet in New York City.  He's there 
to break into the Manhattan art scene (and earn enough money to impress 
her), while she's contemplating marriage to a man named Walter Plane, who 
has commitment problems.  And, hidden beneath the love story, there's a 
mystery. Someone is bankrolling Finn's success.  He assumes it's Miss 
Dinsmore, but is the truth perhaps less obvious?
     I have heard this version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS mentioned in the 
same breath as 1996's ROMEO + JULIET.  And, while there are some 
similarities, it doesn't seem like the most appropriate comparison to 
make.  ROMEO + JULIET used Shakespeare's original text and pumped up the 
visual elements, using riotous colors and camera tricks.  Although 
director Cuaron has a distinctive visual style, it's much more sedate 
than that of Baz Luhrmann, and the only color to have any prominence is 
green.  The dialogue is definitely not Dickens.  On the other hand, GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS bears a strong resemblance to CLUELESS, a re-working of Jane 
Austen's EMMA, in both intent and execution.  The story and themes are 
still there, mostly intact, yet those unfamiliar with the original text 
might not realize that the essential elements have been lifted from a 
classic novel.  
     The actors do admirable jobs.  Hawke is earnest and likable; Paltrow 
is erotic but icy; Bancroft is off-the-wall; and DeNiro is suitably 
sinister.  There's no real heat between Hawke and Paltrow, but there is a 
connection, and the manner in which these two play their scenes has the 
perfect pitch for such an ambiguous, and possibly one-sided, 
relationship.  All of the performances feed into the essence of GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS, with its elements of unrequited love, broken class 
barriers, and unexpected revelations.  
     The script, written by Mitch Glazer (who previously updated another 
Dickens tale, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, as the almost-unwatchable SCROOGED), is 
straightforward, and sticks to the spirit of the original (the ending is 
not embellished, Hollywood-style).  For the most part, this motion 
picture feels like a contemporary fable.  (After all, where else but in a 
fairy tale could you find an empty New York City subway train at six 
o'clock in the morning?)  The majority of the film's missteps are not so 
much the result of shifting the novel in time and place, but of 
condensing it to fit into a two-hour time slot.  GREAT EXPECTATIONS may 
not be an absolute triumph, but it's significantly better than just a 
good effort.

Twee jaar geleden werd "Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet" uitgebracht, een
moderne film gebaseerd op het verhaal van Shakespeare, met Leonardo
DiCaprio en Claire Danes in de hoofdrollen. Vele critici bejubelden deze
versie, omdat de makers het verhaal en de dialogen trouw waren gebleven.
Dat bracht waarschijnlijk Alfonso Cuaron op het idee om van een ander
klassiek verhaal een film te maken. "Great Expectations" dus. 
In "Great Expectations" draait het om de eenvoudige Finnegan Bell (Ethan
Hawke), een arme sloeber met een passie voor tekenen. Hij woont samen
met z'n zus en haar vriend Joe (Chris Cooper) in een oud huis in
Florida, dichtbij de zee. Op een dag gaat Bell samen met Joe de tuin van
mevrouw Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft) opknappen. Dinsmoor is een vreemd en
excentriek figuur, die, na het vertrek van haar bruid, nooit meer
dezelfde geworden is. 
Dinsmoor blijkt ook nog een nichtje te hebben, Estella genaamd. Estella
is, door de opvoeding van haar tante, een harteloos kreng geworden. Toch
valt de dromerige Bell als een blok voor haar. Het doet hem dan ook pijn
te horen dat Estella naar New York vertrekt om daar verder te leren. 
De jaren verstrijken. Bell krijgt veel aanbiedingen voor z'n tekeningen
en besluit om in New York te wonen, om daar verder te tekenen. Toevallig
komt hij daar ook Estella tegen, nu volwassen en een erg mooie vrouw
geworden. Bell besluit zich 100 percent in te zetten om haar hart te
veroveren, maar hij krijgt veel tegenslag te verduren. Van
buitenstaanders יn van Estella zelf. 
"Great Expectations" ziet er prachtig uit. Daar is geen twijfel over
mogelijk. Regisseur Cuaron maakt gebruik van oogverblindende
landschappen, fascinerende achtergronden en betoverende lichteffecten,
zodat de kijker geboeid wordt door de film. Soms is het effect zelfs
betoverend. Een goed voorbeeld daarvan is wanneer Hawke samen met de
gewonde De Niro in de trein zit en naar buiten kijkt. Het landschap
schiet dan voorbij. 
Dit is helaas ook het enige pluspunt van de film, want voor de rest
heeft "Great Expectations" weinig tot niks te bieden. Dit komt vooral
door het verhaal dat, de hele film door, heel vaag en onduidelijk
blijft. Het is een opeenstapeling van
moet-zij-me-nou-wel-of-moet-zij-me-niet-situaties, uitgewerkt met de
intelligentie van een gekookte aardappel. 
Ook kun je je, behalve bij Hawke, niet inleven in ייn van de
hoofdpersonen. Paltrow, Bancroft en De Niro hebben daarvoor te aparte
rollen gekozen en zijn daardoor niet sympathie wekkend. Het einde zal
voor vele mensen (inclusief ondergetekende) dus een verrassing zijn.
Kortom, de film is een nogal raar geheel geworden. Jammer, een gemiste
kans. Is "Romeo & Juliet 2" misschien een goed idee?
