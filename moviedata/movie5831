This movie is one in a long line of Jean-Claude Van Damme action flics
which unfortunately, hasn't reached any pinnacle. The focus in this
movie is on boxing, shooting, comradeship, desert, forlorn love rather
than martial arts. The theme is the French Foreign Legion', meaning
brown uniforms and LOTS of marching. It is very reminiscent of older war
epics like Khartoum'. A good proportion of the movie highlights how
well the men in the Legion are able to march across desert, with a
mixture of heroics highlighted by Van Damme, who includes Dumas' themes
like All for One', but without the Musketeers. If this movie was
intended to capture a Lawrence of Arabia' feel about it, it fails in
the area of cinematography, the sand isn't as white, the kurds not very
menacing (except for blowing up a fort and dragging a man across sand)
and Van Damme is not romance personified. This is not to say he doesn't
try, and this is probably one of his better films  at least he has
dared to venture out of the formula that has been a millstone in
disguise. The ending is abrupt and leaves the viewer wandering whether
they ran out of footage or budget and is the film's weakest point.
