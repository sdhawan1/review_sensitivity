CAST AWAY (director: Robert Zemeckis; screenwriter: William Broyles Jr.;
cinematographer: Don Burgess; editor: Arthur Schmidt; cast: Tom Hanks
(Chuck Noland), Helen Hunt (Kelly Frears), Nick Searcy (Stan), Chris
Noth (Jerry Lovett), Lari White (Bettina Peterson); Runtime: 143; 20th
Century Fox/Dreamworks; 2000)
A risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is
somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its
romantic mode, as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic
survival film. The film is carried solely by Tom Hanks' splendid
performance, with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or
dialogue the changes he is going through, as he acts through use of
facial expressions and body language. He even starts off as a bit
overweight, but by the time he leaves his island, he's skinny (He must
have gone on some crash diet to have lost the reported 50 pounds!).
The adventure story is reminiscent of a modern-day Robinson Crusoe tale,
and is divided into three distinct parts, with Tom Hanks being the
film's mainstay. In the first part, he's shown as a compulsive
workaholic, a stickler for efficiency and being on time, who is employed
as a FedEx management system engineer from Memphis. He is in the new
free market Russia of the mid-nineties, there to help his company get
more efficient in its deliveries. On his return from Russia, he
exchanges Christmas gifts at the Memphis airport runway with his
grad-student girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) and tells her he'll be
right back from this latest assignment to Asia. He is about to pop the
marriage question to her, but must catch his plane, so he instead gives
her a wrapped box with a ring in it and tells her they'll open it
together when he returns on New Year's Eve. But his FedEx plane runs
into foul weather and strays off course and then explodes in mid-air
from undisclosed chemicals it has in storage, and he becomes the sole
survivor, using the plane's raft to reach a barren island.
The second part of the film is almost bare of dialogue and runs for
close to two hours, showing how he survives while living alone on this
South Pacific island for 4 years. The striking visuals and penetrating
silence, give this film a surprising depth to its storytelling.
The last part of the film, shows him returning from being perceived as
dead and having to adjust to Kelly marrying and raising a family.
The heart of the film is about Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) ironically going
from his job where he is obsessed by time to living on a barren island
where time doesn't matter and there is no rush to do anything. He slowly
learns how to survive, light a fire without matches, cut open the
coconuts, catch crabs, build a shelter, and as an additional irony, he
is surrounded by FedEx packages washed ashore, as he learns to make use
of the various objects he finds in them. In one of the packages, he
comes across a volleyball and smears a blood-stained face on it and
names it Wilson. He converses with it as if it were a human companion.
Hanks' is now faced with panic and he reacts by acting childlike,
thinking that is the only way he can survive without going nuts.
There were times that this island fare seemed mildly poetic, but at
other times it began to wear heavy as time dragged with only Tom Hanks
on the screen to keep the fire going. Yet the film had a certain appeal
to it...a boldness not often seen in commercial films, as it bravely did
without dialogue for great parts of the island story. This lent a
certain sense of unpredictability to it and made the simple story lend
itself to being more introspective and interestingly perceived.
The major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending, where it ran
out of story and didn't know how to make Hanks' return to Memphis and
civilization shed some light on what he's been through without
trivializing that experience. Hanks, while on a deserted crossroad after
delivering a FedEx package that survived the crash, doesn't seem certain
of what's in store for him in the future but puts on an artificial
pretty face as he wanly smiles (knowingly, he will always live alone
with that island experience).
But what didn't resonate was the ambiguity of the film's ending. I think
the film had nowhere to go after he was rescued by ship while on a raft,
as he chose to take a perilous chance to sail the ocean in order to get
back to civilization rather than remain as a caveman-like survivor on
that desolate island. That is the simple point the film is trying to
make and where the film should have ended, but when it tries to
reinforce its sappy love story with characters who had too little screen
time to have an effect on the story and it forces corny words on those
characters in order to resolve Hanks' love situation, the film thereby
loses something by its Hollywoodish formulaic message it tries
desperately to land safely on. Otherwise, a pleasing film from the
director of Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis. One of his better ones...with
the adventure part of the film having some appeal though not delving
deep enough into the survivor's psyche for it to have an even greater
appeal. But it was far superior to that recently popular Survivor TV
show, which had more to do about making a million bucks than surviving.

     Chuck Noland (played by the versatile Tom Hanks) is a very
dedicated executive for Federal Express, the package delivery
company.  He is extremely systematic and obsessed with the passage
of time.  Chuck has become a local legend for his dedication to
delivering packages on time.  He is even the center of a Federal
Express urban myth about the lengths he will go to get a package
delivered on time.  Chuck knows that in his business time is all
important for him, but unknown to him, he is about to spend the next
few years of his life in a place where time is far more subjective.
     Chuck is napping on a company flight over the Pacific and
awakes to discover that the plane is off course in a storm and
desperately trying to find its way back.  Suddenly the world falls
apart under him and we find ourselves in a crashing plane that is
rapidly decompressing.  After what well might be the scariest plane
crash in cinema history Chuck finds himself in a life raft in a
storm alone on a hostile ocean.  With extreme good fortune he is
blown to an island.  But perhaps the island is not such good luck as
he has no tools and no means to feed and protect himself.  How he
does that is the heart of the film.  Unfortunately, there is not
enough of this heart.
     The problem is that the buildup to this point really takes too
much time.  The script shows you a bit of his relationship with his
lover Kelly Frears (played by Helen Hunt).  But once he is on the
island that part of the film really is necessary only to establish
that he has a woman whom he dearly loves.  Developing that
relationship takes valuable time from coverage of the island
experience.  The opening setup is not only unneeded, it is also
puzzling.  We are taken to a large family Christmas dinner at which
everyone in the family seems to dress the same and work for Federal
Express.  That strikes the viewer as peculiar, but it leads to
nothing.  It not only wastes precious screentime, it does nothing to
enhance the story.  What it does serve to do is give Federal Express
an even larger product placement than the huge one they would
already have.
     The centerpiece of this film is the air crash which is as
detailed as it is frightening.  One might almost say it was done in
the realistic style of the beach landing of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and
may be nearly as harrowing.  It packs quite an impact and I will
certainly think of its images the next time that I fly.  Trust me,
you should not expect to see this film as an airline in-flight
movie.
     This in many ways is an engineer's film.  With a set of modest
tools washed up on the shore from the crash or available on the
island he is forced to reinvent or discover ways to fulfill his
needs.  He must reinterpret objects from a few floating FedEx
packages as the tools to build his small world.  And the knowledge
of how to do that does not come easily.  In the beginning he is
almost a laughable character, strange-looking and overweight, and he
makes foolish and frustrating mistakes.  And he pays for those
mistakes in pain and blood.  What seem like very small tasks in
civilization become extremely hard.
     As time goes by, Chuck's intelligence as well as his fitness
seems to improve immensely, though not his sanity.  I think that the
most interesting point made by the film is that sanity may be really
a social affectation.  Many people let down their guard when they
are alone and do things like talking to themselves that they would
not do in front of others.  Chuck's circumstances are more extreme
and he goes a lot further.  To save the greater part of his reason
must sacrifice the lessor part.  Chuck allows his sanity fall away
and to be replaced by a benign and natural insanity.  He invents a
friend to talk with.  In order to battle the solitude he even comes
to love the friend.  But he can only do this because he is alone.
If he knew anyone was watching him he would be inhibited from
creating such a friend.  Yet his actions seem natural.  Perhaps we
are all at least partly insane and keep that part in check while
there is danger that other people may find out.  And those others
also keep their irrational sides hidden.  While this phenomenon is
usually interpreted as the solitude driving him insane, it seems
really to be a process of the privacy allowing him to drop his
guard.  He allows himself to be natural in ways that few other
people in the world can.
     This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to
build up to in the final scene.  But it was not all the film it
could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best
material lay.  It rates a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.  Wouldn't this be a good time for Luis Bunuel's
1952 ROBINSON CRUSOE to show up again and be rediscovered?  I
haven't seen it since I was five years old, but by all accounts it
was quite good.  Extra: look in this film for an emotionally charged
scene that seems to be borrowed from MISSION TO MARS.

Cast Away  * * *1/2 out of * * * * 
Starring: Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Nick Searcy, Christopher Noth, Lari White.
Directed by: Robert Zemeckis
Running Time: 143 minutes
Rated PG-13: intense action, some violence/gore.
Robert Zemeckis may as well be the next genius, even with the not so great 
"Death Becomes Her", Zemeckis gave it a touch to make it enjoyable and 
entertaining, and it even won an Academy Award for it's astonishing special 
effects. Earlier in 2000 Zemeckis brought us the clever and scary "What Lies 
Beneath", and now for the holiday season of 2000 "Cast Away" another pairing 
of Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks, and behold we have a new 'great' movie to 
add to my top 10 of 2000 list.
Tom Hanks plays FedEx executive Chuck Noland, who is in Europe with his 
"recruits" teaching them how to become faster FedEx employees. He promises 
the love of his life Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) that he will return to her, 
and does but is quickly called back into work. While boarding the plane he 
mutters the words "I'll be right back" and boards the doomed flight. His 
plane takes a quick nosedive towards the ocean below, and Chuck survives and 
is washed along a shore on a nearby island. Not sure what to do, or where he 
is, he panics but soon starts to adapt to island life. Now he must try to 
survive on the island, as well as not give up hope to get back to his 
life...and his love Kelly.
An amazing story of not only survival and love, but also as a character study 
we get to know who Chuck Noland really is, and what he wants in life. His 
love for Kelly Frears is so strong that I was hoping, and praying he was 
going to make it back home. Of course if you have seen the trailer for the 
movie, you know what happens, and if you haven't then I guess you will have 
to watch the movie to find out. 
Tom Hanks who has starred in several great movies (Saving Private Ryan, 
Forrest Gump, and even Big) he has come to be possibly my favorite actor of 
the century if not all time. He won an Oscar for his brilliant work as a man 
with AIDS fired because he was gay in "Philadelphia"...to his memorable 
character of the sweet Forrest Gump in "Forrest Gump" Tom Hanks has come to 
show he can give great performances, "Cast Away" is no let down. Once Tom 
Hanks graces the screen, he becomes Chuck Noland and becomes a survivor on 
the island. Spending almost an hour and a half on the screen by himself, it 
is absolutely mind-blowing how we are so absorbed by him on this island, that 
the time flies by. 
This may be Tom Hanks' best performance of his career, and with an Oscar 
Nomination on his heels, he certainly deserves it. Helen Hunt who starred in 
the awful "Dr. T & The Women", the funny "What Women Want", and pain inducing 
"Pay it Forward" plays Kelly Frears, the love of Chuck's life. Even though 
she is given maybe twenty minutes of screen time total, what she has is 
fantastic and what she does with it is amazing. A scene towards the end of 
the movie is so touching, that a tear came to my eye and my heart started to 
beat fast. Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt definitely have that screen formula, they 
make a great couple.
Talking before about Robert Zemeckis and his genius direction "Cast Away" is 
no exception, with some of the island scenes being beautifully shot, the 
locations being absolutely marvelous I was quite impressed. While not having 
the nifty camera shots "What Lies Beneath" had, and you have to admit there 
was some cool shots, "Cast Away" relies more on the study of Chuck and his 
survival. The script by William Broyles Jr. is in it's own way mind-blowing 
because of the fact for almost an hour and half as mentioned before, Tom 
Hanks is alone in the movie on the island with only a few lines of dialogue 
said. 
"Cast Away" has a place on my top 10 list of 2000, it's a nearly flawless 
character study of a man who has to rely on himself to survive. Some people 
may try to compare this to the new phenomena "Survivor", but since that show 
has several people, and "Cast Away" has one person...it is quite hard to even 
begin to compare. The ending is something to be questioned, and like most of 
Zemeckis' endings, it can be taken in anyway the viewer wants. "Cast Away" is 
not just a great film, but a great example of how Hollywood still has the 
ability to make good movies.

Federal Express troubleshooter Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) travels the world
to spread the word to the growing number of FedEx employees that "we live
or die by the clock." Time is everything to Chuck and even the Christmas
celebration with his fiancée, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), is measured in
minutes as he is called away, yet again, to deal with some new company
crisis. On the way to his latest emergency an unexpected problem forces his
jet to ditch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, leaving Chuck alone to
survive or die on a deserted isle in Roger Zemeckis's latest, "Cast Away."
Chuck is a true workaholic who lives his life by his tenets of time. When
we first meet him he is lecturing a group of Muscovite FedEx workers (with
a translator) on the time criticality of delivering their packages around
"the world on time." In a whirlwind, Chuck finishes one job, joins his
family for Christmas dinner, proposes to Kelly and is off again on his next
corporate disaster. This time, though, things go drastically wrong, his
plane crashes and Chuck finds himself stranded, alone, on a small, isolated
tropical island.
Without food or water, the castaway has to find the means to survive. He
learns, quickly, to find fresh water. He then harvests coconuts, after
almost getting conked by one, and extracts their milk and meat. Fishing is
next and Chuck learns the rudiments of fashioning tools and making fire.
It's a Robinson Crusoe tale sans Friday and evil pirates as he learns to
survive and live one day at a time. Time itself, ironically, changes as
Chuck starts thinking in terms of days, months and years instead of minutes
and seconds.
Chuck is trapped on the island by a powerful breakwater that hurls him and
his rubber raft back to the beach whenever he tries to get past. One day, a
fortunate piece of flotsam, the remains of a port-a-potty, washes up on the
island. It is perfect to make a sturdy sail that may just push him through
the waves of the breakers. As in any survivor flick, you're rooting for the
stranded hero every step of the way as he learns the ropes of survival and
escape.
"Cast Away" is, except for the requisite special F/X of the jet crash and
sinking into the depths of the Pacific (a chilling moment), a survival
flick, pure and very simple. Once the disaster of the crash is behind him,
Chuck has to face the prospects of no food, no water and no companions,
except for a picture in an antique watch given to him by Kelly. It is his
one link to sanity and civilization and, as the days drag on to months then
years, is one of the two things that keep him sane on the tiny island. I'll
get to the other in a moment.
Immediately after the crash and through much of his stay on the island,
FedEx packages keep washing ashore. Chuck very neatly sorts them all and
puts them aside for future delivery. After a while it becomes obvious to
Chuck that he should open them up to see if there is anything useful. He
finds, among other things, a volleyball, a pair of figure skates and a
fancy dress. The always thinking Chuck puts everything to use, Including
the volleyball. An accident causes him to smear the ball with his own
blood. The handprint becomes the basis for a face. The face takes on a name
- Wilson (what did you expect, Spaulding?) - and a companion is born. (This
companion device smacks of another survival film, 1971's "Omega Man," where
Charlton Heston anthropomorphizes a bust of Julius Caesar into a
conversation buddy.) Wilson becomes such a close friend that, when Chuck
gets separated from "him," you feel the man's loss of his friend.
The bulk of the film is about Chuck's survival and, with a masterful
one-man performance by Hanks, is a compelling tale told in straightforward
terms. There is no man Friday, no marauding pirates and no shark or giant
octopus attacks. It's all about living and surviving, both physically and
emotionally, from day to day without giving up or losing hope. There is
ample foreshadowing of events and changes to Chuck early on in the film as
he, as an aside, tells Kelly he has to get a tooth taken care of. You know
that pesky tooth is going to plague him later, but the script, by William
Boyle, Jr., makes such certainties a surprise.
The last part of the flick, its weakest, has Chuck, rescued, returning home
to find the object of his emotional survival, Kelly, married to another.
She is still his true love, but not his to have anymore. His angst is soon
wrapped up in a cute little coda that has Chuck delivering the one package
he saved. The final scene takes place, literally, at a crossroads where we
hope Chuck will make the right decision and gets on with his life. It's all
very feel good and positive but a disappointment after living with Chuck
through his four years of lonely isolation. With little time spent to
develop ancillary characters, in particular Hunt as Kelly, there is little
to the film beyond Hanks.
The best moments in "Cast Away" are sometime melancholy and sometimes
exciting. Chuck's obsession with escape takes on the same manic proportions
as Steve McQueen in "Papillon" and, when he finally breaks free, you feel
his thrill. A quiet, nighttime interlude has Chuck sail through a pod of
whales and one of them looks the man right in the eye, as if to comfort
him, that all will be well. And, of course, there are the conversations
with Wilson as the ball takes on more and more human characteristics in the
eyes of Chuck.
The production team, led by helmer Zemeckis, does a superb, understated job
in creating the lonely, island prison that holds Chuck captive. Lensing, by
Don Burgess, is in keeping with the island environment, putting you in the
middle of Chuck's day to day existence. Costume and makeup take almost a
comedic turn, at one point later in the film, where Chuck rises from the
water holding a trident to spear fish. The image of Neptune smacks you
right in the face, I hope intentionally by the makers. Kudos must go to
Hanks for the tremendous physical effort he underwent, gaining weight to
portray the pre-castaway Chuck, then losing 50 pounds to become the new,
sleek Chuck. The contrast is striking.
One thing is bound to come out of "Cast Away" - a deserved best actor
nomination for Hanks. It's a good, not great, film and a terrific character
study. I give it a B.

There's been a lot of movies, books and TV shows about people being stranded 
on a desert island. In most cases the formula is used for comedy or 
adventure, rarely drama. That's what separates "Cast Away" from all the other 
stories of the genre, because this is the probably the most realistic 
depiction of what a human would go through under the circumstances. The 
result is definitely interesting but not nearly as powerful as it could have 
been. 
This is a movie that's every bit generic as lowbrow action movies and teenage 
slasher flicks. If you think about it, this is a really easy script to write: 
man loves wife shown in opening act; man gets on plane and says "I'll be 
right back;" man's plane crashes into the ocean with man being the only 
survivor; man ends up on desert island; man must survive - will man ever get 
back home? And if man does get back home what will have changed? 
Yup, that pretty much sums up "Cast Away," the only other details you really 
need to know is that Tom Hanks stars in the "man" role as Chuck Noland, an 
employee for Federal Express whose job it is to make sure packages get 
delivered all over the world on time. Helen Hunt plays the "wife" role, 
Kelly. There's virtually no other supporting characters, just minor 
characters plugged in to fill out the story a little. 
There's little point in discussing the first act of the film because it works 
EXACTLY how you'd expect a movie like this to. Hanks is a hard-assed boss who 
takes his job just a tad too seriously. It's Christmas time and at home he 
and his wife host a big family gathering and it's implied that the two have a 
pretty good marriage but it could be a lot better if they weren't so busy. 
Kelly tries to convince Chuck to take some time off work but he can't, at 
least not immediately. She even gives him a family heirloom with her picture 
in it and when Chuck's plane goes down and he escapes to the island it's the 
only personal possession he retains. Awwww..... 
But all sappiness aside, this film still works well as a story of man's basic 
instinct to survive, to fend off the elements and to overcome loneliness. The 
Pacific Ocean is a huge, vast place just like outer space and being stuck in 
the middle of it -hundreds or thousands of miles away from civilization is a 
very scary situation. 
There was a shot in "Titanic" that stands out in my mind as one of the most 
powerful images I've ever seen. As the ship is sinking in the middle of the 
night and all hell breaks loose, crew members fire flares in the air hoping 
another ship will see it and come to their rescue. Then the camera cuts back 
to about a mile in the air where we see the ocean is as black as oil and that 
flare is a small speck of light - so tiny it's pathetic. It's a shot that 
conveys the utter hopelessness and bleakness of the situation, and "Cast 
Away" is kind of like that idea made into an entire movie. 
If you were stuck on a desert island all by yourself would you be able to 
survive? Would you be willing to become a cro-magnon man, having to kill your 
food with your bare hands, make your own tools, and build your own shelter 
just from the things around you? Chuck Noland doesn't have a lot of choice 
and we watch as his learns how to adapt. 
Zemeckis never really gives you clues about what's going to happen next. 
There's no story at all, just our observations of how this man survives. He's 
not a Navy SEAL or anything, he's pretty clueless what to do and that gives 
us a tremendous amount of sympathy for him. When coconuts fall off the trees 
he knows they can be a source of food but trying to get one open is the tough 
part. We watch as he throws them against a rock, the bashes it with a smaller 
rock until the rock in his hand crumbles! He must also learn to make fire 
without any matches, to make rope out of palms, to eat fish and crabs raw and 
to maintain his sanity without anyone else to talk to, without anything to 
read and much of anything remotely recreational to do. 
And this is pretty much all that happens for a good 80 or 90 minutes - the 
bulk of the film. Hanks doesn't have a lot of lines since the only one he can 
talk to is himself or his "friend" - a volleyball named Wilson. But it's his 
raw emotions that drive the film. If you were in the same position  and 
didn't know what you were doing wouldn't you make a lot of mistakes? The best 
moments of the film occur when something bad happens to Chuck. He slashes his 
hand trying to use a rock as a knife; he nearly impales himself on the coral 
reef trying to sail out past the breakers; he realizes the area rescuers will 
have to cover to find both the plane and him add up to a search area of about 
500,000 miles. 
Realizing this Chuck says, "That's twice the size of Texas," with a look on 
his face as if he knew all hope was lost. It's a subtle but profound moment, 
something reminiscent of a Stanley Kubrick device. 
How to describe the rest of the film though? If you haven't seen it do you 
want to know how long he's stuck there for? Do you want to know if he ever 
tries to get off the island, and if so how? Do you want to know if he'll ever 
get back home? 
Watching this film from a critic's point of view I wasn't so much concerned 
with whether Chuck would get home or not, I was more interested in the 
process of him doing so. The film had already done a good job in showing the 
loneliness of the situation, of the human instinct to survive and the last 
act just takes both of these ideas one step further. The island in the middle 
of the ocean is a pretty frightening idea, but being out in the ocean on a 
raft is even more so. On the island Chuck was at least a cork in the ocean, 
out of the raft he's just a teardrop (actually, more like teardrop molecule). 
Thankfully this picture spares us any gratuitous shark attack scenes or huge 
tidal waves and hurricanes, etc. 
It ends how you'd expect it to end - that's neither a good nor bad thing. 
So "Cast Away" is a pretty good movie, but it's nothing profound. It does 
have some originality for a desert island story but the backstory about 
Chuck's personal life is quite sappy and the ending doesn't have the dramatic 
bite it's going for. I'm sure there's some way this could have been an 
all-out excellent film, but what we get is good enough for me.

   Everyone who took American Lit. 101 knows that Ralph
Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau advised us to be
self-reliant and to simplify, respectively.  If they were alive
today, instead of looking at their own statues they would be
building one to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), who took their
philosophies to a logical conclusion, however involuntarily.  In
a picture featuring Don Burgess's gorgeous cinematography
the qualities of which are duplicated this year only by Peter
Pau ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"); a virtual one-man,
tour de force performance by Tom Hanks (who may be on
the road to appropriating yet another Oscar); and a nicely
toned-down appearance by Helen Hunt as Chuck Noland's
girl friend, Kelly Frears--Robert Zemeckis scores big with a
grand show that in some ways resembles his 1994 opus
"Forrest Gump."  Both "Gump" and "Cast Away" deal with
internal voyages taken by their principal characters, but this
time around Zemeckis hones in on scripter William Broyles
Jr.'s intelligent, rapid-fire, cutting-edge FedEx executive who
may be able to grasp a lot more about the world's reality than
Gump ever could but who, like the mentally challenged hero
of the 1994 film, has been so distracted that he has lost track
of what is really important in life.
   "Cast Away" has quite a bit going for it, qualities that make
the movie an original.  1) Cameraman Burgess has
photographed what is possibly the most agonizing minutes of
an aircraft in trouble yet filmed, a shattering experience that
guarantees the movie's absence on any airline company's
agenda. 2) Burgess ably contrasts the use of a static camera
when capturing the inertness of an uninhabited island in the
South Pacific with a hand-held camera to capture the frenzy
of an executive giving a staccato lecture to a group of
Moscovites who have just been employed by Federal
Express. (As product placements go, this movie does for
FedEx as "What Women Want" does for Nike.)  3) Those in
the audience who are travelers will catch the ironies of a
highly-strung corporate honcho placed in the most languid
situation possible, and the concept of what could be an
unspoiled tropical island ripe for tourism by the very rich
which is instead the equivalent of solitary confinement on
Devil's Island.
   Carefully developing his character from the start, Zemeckis
makes sure that his final scene will be emotionally draining
on the audience, a heartfelt, heartbreaking conclusion to a
story dense with both allegorical and realistic meaning. 
Chuck Noland is giving a swift lecture to a group of new
FedEx employees in Moscow, people who perhaps were
heretofore laid-back souls casually putting in their time under
a Communist government but now challenged to beat the
clock if they want to keep their well-paid gigs.  Though not
holding the employees to the FedEx American standard, a
guarantee that the package sent tonight will be received at its
domestic destination by 10:30 the next morning, he insists
that the crew be aware of the clock at every moment.  On the
way home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girl friend
Kelly, his aircraft develops trouble and goes down into the
waters of the South Pacific, killing all but Chuck--who at first
is confident of rescue until he later realizes that his search
party would have to comb an area larger than the size of
Texas to locate him.  
   A long stretch in the middle part of the film shows this
modern Robinson Crusoe adapting himself to the needs of
physical survival which, once attained, allows him to turn to
his spiritual side or, to put simply, to find a way to keep his
sanity with no one but a volleyball which he appropriately
names Wilson to hear his conversation.   Four years later--
that's four YEARS later--he returns to his Memphis home
amazed at the ease with which he could pick up food on a
buffet groaning board and create a flame at the flick of a
switch.  For some moments we wonder whether Chuck has
fallen in love with the extreme hardships he had to face and
is ready, like Werner Herzog's Kasper Hauser, to return to
the primitive life on his massive Walden Pond.  Reappearing
to his girl friend who had given him up for dead years earlier,
Chuck arrives at a literal and metaphoric crossroads.  He is
ready to begin life anew.
   It would not be a great leap to look at "Cast Away" as not
only a contemporary "Robinson Crusoe" or even "Everyman"
tale but as a speedup account of the world at the time of the
Flintstones.  Arriving on a island seemingly bare of birds,
insects, or tools, Chuck learns how to make a primitive knife
out of a couple of stones and how to get milk and meat from
some coconuts that do everything in their power to resist his
desire to crack them open.  Equipped at least with the
teaching of civilization unknown to prehistoric man, he does
not take long in discovering how to light a fire without
matches and keep it burning; how to vary his coconut diet
with crustaceans and the fruits of the sea; how to built a raft
that might keep him moving toward civilization despite the
resistance of nature; even how to invent art to keep him
occupied when the bare essentials of survival are guaranteed
(he paints a face on the volleyball with his own blood). 
Primitive man creates art.
   If Ed Harris gained 30 or 40 pounds for his role as the
disspated title character in the movie "Pollock," then Tom
Hanks had the more difficult role of losing 55 pounds over the
sixteen months' period that Zemeckis gave him while that
director proceeded to make another film in the interim.  When
you gaze at this legendary actor looking trim and fit--
presumably the result of keeping as active as a cave dweller
hunting for food and having no pies, cakes or even bagels to
help develop a spare tire--you may wonder as well whether
you should forget about Club Med this year and go on your
own to one of the few pieces of land in the world not already
developed by Marriott or Hilton or Intercontinental.  Critic Rex
Reed, in a love-letter of a review, stated that he spent part of
the picture crying, the other part shutting his eyes from the
impact of Noland's journey.  While I had to look away only
when Noland proceeded to knock out an infected tooth with
the use of a stone and the blades of an ice skate that
washed ashore in a FedEx package, I'd have to admit that
while Zemeckis' picture stretches the narrative form to its limit
given the long period that Hanks performs monologues to his
volleyball, the nearly two and one-half hours went by in a
flash.  "What's beautiful about the world is the world itself,"
said a grandmother in a greeting card to a young member of
her family.  Paradoxically the beauty of nature captured in
this unusual and remarkable film is the very power that can
kill or at the very least drive one insane.  
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 143 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

When it comes to Tom Hanks, it is difficult to criticize him. Why you may 
ask? Because as an actor, he becomes so enveloped in his roles that it is 
hard to notice when he is or isn't acting - the Jimmy Stewart of our 
generation simply becomes the characters he plays without any obvious tics or 
methods to his madness. And make no mistake, Hanks is not playing himself, he 
is acting but since it is invisible, it is harder to trace. From his 
Oscar-winning turn in "Philadelphia" to last year's sympathetic prison guard 
in "The Green Mile," Hanks is one of our best actors because he consistently 
surprises audiences and critics alike in his choice of roles. As the 
efficient Chuck Noland, Hanks has his most demanding role to date, eschewing 
his soft side for a more snippy side considering the location he is placed in 
- the rough terrain of a lost island. 
At the start of the film (in a far too long prologue), Chuck is already in a 
race against time considering he is a Fed-Ex employee. He chastises the 
Russians in Moscow for late arrivals of packages (he keeps timers inside 
packages he self-mails to prove his point). His intent is to keep the 
business efficient and on the mark, or else the whole company will end up 
like the U.S. mail.
Chuck barely maintains an intimate relationship with his girlfriend, Kelly 
(Helen Hunt), whom he tries to propose at Christmas time in good old Memphis 
(It is no surprise to discover that Chuck is an Elvis lover). Unfortunately, 
time is another scapegoat as Chuck is off on another trip in his busy work 
schedule, delivering a package that must arrive overnight to its designated 
location. He hands Kelly an engagement ring in a box, to be opened when he 
gets back. And off he goes yet during a catastrophic thunderstorm, the plane 
crashes near some uncharted island...and if you have seen the trailers for 
this film, you'll know Chuck becomes a castaway and is thus cast away as well 
from civilization. 
Chuck arrives in this uninhabited island on a deflated raft. Some Fed-Ex 
packages wash ashore as well, but what is this man going to do? He has no 
cell phone, no plane, hardly any food except for coconuts (a natural 
laxative), and is in an island where nobody ever comes through. He has to 
depend on his survival instincts of course which develop rather quickly, 
including spearing fish, building fires, gathering wood, making videotape 
with rope, using roller skates as cutting tools, living inside a cave for 
shelter, and so on. Chuck is our modern-day Robinson Crusoe without benefit 
of videographers or unwanted bystanders from the popular "Survivor" show - he 
is truly an isolated man who finds a partner in a Wilson volleyball. 
The scenes on the island are truly awesome, and director Zemeckis is often at 
his best here evoking long silent pauses in many of these scenes, as it 
should be. At least we are spared the bickering of Anne Heche and Harrison 
Ford in the charmless "Six Days, Seven Nights." This is an existential 
journey for Chuck, left pondering about his existence and his girlfriend 
Kelly and if he will ever get out of the island. How long can a man talk to a 
volleyball before becoming insane? 
I will not give away too much more of "Cast Away" but I will say that the 
film's bookends are less stronger than the crux of the story - a man's 
survival in an unnamed island forced to deal with the losses in his life. 
This was the same flaw in "Green Mile" and "Saving Private Ryan" - when will 
Hanks step out of these damn bookends? The last few scenes in the film do 
work, and there is a level of ambiguity that is much appreciated in these 
days of cookie-cutter Hollywood movies. But it is not as powerful as all 
those scenes on the island. 
Hanks does some of his best work ever here, exuding a little toughness, 
snippiness and cynicism about himself and his past and future existence - 
this may well be Hanks's first existential, fully mature leading man role to 
date. The transformation from a fastidious workaholic to a harried man ("I 
just have to keep breathing") is quite affecting to watch. 
Helen Hunt, an often bland actress, gives a surprisingly touching 
performance. Her Kelly is aware that Chuck may not always be there for her 
because of his strenuous job, and thus becomes aware of loss early on. It's a 
small role for Hunt but not a thankless one (as it was in "What Women Want"), 
and about as magnetic as her work in the Oscar-winning "As Good as it Gets." 
"Cast Away" is finally about loss and how to deal with it in purely 
fundamental terms. Being cast away from civilization as we know it may be a 
greater loss than one can fathom, and Chuck knows it for the period of time 
he remains on the island. If the opening and closing sequences had been 
truncated somewhat and if Zemeckis had spent more time on that island, then 
"Cast Away" would have been a superb motion picture. As it stands, it is a 
solid entertainment and there are scenes as moving as any I've seen in all of 
2000, yet it could have been so much more. Still, my vote stands for "Cast 
Away," casting aside "Survivor" any day of the week.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis.
Cast: Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Nick Searcy, Lari White, Michael Forest, Viveka 
Davis, Jenifer Lewis.
2000 - 143 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for an ultra-realistic plane crash and mild profanity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, December 23, 2000.
At first glance, "Cast Away," directed by Robert Zemeckis (2000's "What Lies 
Beneath"), may appear to be a feature film version of TV's "Survivor," where 
a man stranded on an island must learn to fend for himself in order to stay 
alive. Zemeckis and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. could very well have 
made such a movie and come up with a first-rate adventure-thriller, along the 
lines of 1988's "A Cry in the Wild." Instead, their purpose is exposed to be 
something else entirely, and the title hints at this ambitious aim. Instead 
of being about a castaway, the picture is about a man very much dependent on 
today's technology to help him live his life, who, through circumstances out 
of his hands, is cast away from society, and must start his life anew. 
In, perhaps, a career-best performance in a very long line of successes, Tom 
Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a loyal Federal Express executive who devotes 
much of his time trying to make the company as good as it can be. Following a 
short Christmas reunion with his sweetheart, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), he is 
paged to return to work, although not before handing her a small, wrapped 
present that both parties know is an engagement ring. While traveling across 
the Pacific, Chuck's plane runs into severe turbulence due to a nasty storm 
and it ultimately crashes. Narrowly escaping with an inflatable raft in hand 
and a treasured locket with a picture of Kelly inside that she gave to him 
before he shoved off, Chuck eventually finds himself washed ashore on a 
desolate island devoid of any other human life.
For its middle 75 minutes, "Cast Away" is a hugely involving and fascinating 
look at the way Chuck deals with being cut off from all people and everyday 
conveniences, as he is forced to learn how to survive with very few 
resources. With a wealth of coconuts surrounding him, Chuck's diet becomes 
solely dependent on the fruit until he learns to start a fire from the 
friction of sticks and eventually work his way up to crabs and fish. And 
thanks to a bunch of Fed Ex packages that drifted to shore, Chuck gains 
access to a few limited articles of clothing, ice skates whose sharp blades 
come in handy, and a volleyball that becomes his only friend and a personal 
salvation on the island, going as far as painting a face on one side using 
his own blood from a wound.
It's no secret from the television ads and theatrical trailer that Chuck 
does, indeed, make it back to civilization. While more suspense might have 
surrounded such a question had it not been so blatantly given away, such a 
decision holds absolutely no bearing on the success or overall impact of the 
film. In a way, it is a positive thing, as it directs the viewer's attention 
away from a possibly unknown outcome, and toward the deeper meanings behind 
the picture's existence. The final 30 minutes, with Chuck now back home 
following a four-year disappearance that led everyone to believe he was dead 
(and going as far as holding a funeral for him), is just about as powerful 
and truthful of a denouement as could possibly be expected.
"Cast Away" is a cinematic triumph, a motion picture so rich with honest 
emotions and ideas that it comes as a relative surprise that this is a 
big-budget, star vehicle. Rarely does Hollywood prove that it is still 
capable of making intelligent, adult fare, so when such a stirring feat 
occurs, it is all the more reason to rejoice. The movie is thoroughly 
entertaining for the entirety of its nearly 2 1/2-hour running time, and it 
is effective on every level--both as a character study, and an accurately 
drawn adventure yarn.
Appearing in every scene (save for a 3-minute prologue that delves into the 
lives of Fed Ex workers across the globe), Tom Hanks (1999's "The Green 
Mile") is astounding. Highly publicized for the unorthodox way in which 
Zemeckis made the film, taking nearly a year off in between in order for 
Hanks to drop 60 lbs., it is a testament to Hanks' loyalty to his craft to go 
through such a rigorous process. Impressing even more greatly than his 
physical appearance is his performance, deeply charged with serious emotions 
and subtly dodging any signs of saccharine drama. With the majority of the 
picture literally a one-man show (and with this sizable middle chunk also 
devoid of music and very little dialogue), Hanks is able to single-handedly 
take hold of the screen and keep the viewer with him at all times. Very few 
actors could ever spend 75 minutes alone onscreen and remain captivating, but 
Hanks does just that.
In her fourth film appearance in the last three months (with the other three 
being in "Dr. T and the Women," "Pay It Forward," and "What Women Want"), 
Helen Hunt is perfectly cast as the love of Chuck's life, Kelly. While, no 
doubt, the smallest role Hunt has had this year, it is also her strongest 
performance. Not only is it easy to see why Chuck loves Kelly so very much, 
and why she is one of the reasons he hangs onto the hope of seeing her again 
one day, but Hunt injects the part with a level of compassion and 
heartbreaking pathos that is truly unforgettable.
An allegory on the importance most people place on material items, and the 
extreme impact being cut off from such things can have on someone, "Cast 
Away" is the exquisite, thought-provoking journey of a man who ultimately 
must find a way to put his life back together when everything he had 
previously known changes in the four years he is gone. And even more, it is 
an unforgettable love story between two smart, likable people who know they 
were meant for each other--and keep that fact between them, even when they 
realistically know nothing can ever be the same again. With 2000 quickly 
reaching a close, "Cast Away" is easily one of the very best films of the 
year.

Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) emphasizes the digital clock just installed in
Fed Ex's newest office in Russia to his new hires in training.  He calls
his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) to rhapsodize over the fact that he's 
sorting packages within the shadows of Red Square, and that he'll be
home for Christmas in Memphis in eighteen hours.  At the extensive family 
dinner table, the troubleshooter is beeped for another emergency halfway
around the world, forcing him to exchange gifts with Kelly in their car at 
the airport.  She gives him a pocket watch containing her picture that had 
belonged to her grandfather.  He gives her a package the size of a ring box, 
waves and declares 'I'll be right back!' in director Robert Zemeckis' "Cast 
Away."
Of course, Chuck isn't right back.  The private FedEx plane he's on begins
to encounter mechanical difficulties in a storm over the Pacific.  Chuck
risks hurtling objects to secure his new pocketwatch, then watches the
sea approaching through the cockpit windshield.  Miraculously, he finds his
way out of the plane and inflates a life raft, which pulls him to the stormy
surface.  Luck is again on his side when he washes up on an abandoned beach.
However, he quickly discovers the island is uninhabitted, so constructs
a large help sign on the beach and begins to gather wreckage, packages
and the one dead body which wash ashore in the aftermath of his crash.
Survival means learning how to open coconuts, catch fish, and make fire.
As it begins to dawn on Chuck that his chances of rescue are slight (he
figures out that the search area must be twice the area of Texas), he
starts to open the FedEx packages he's neatly stacked and protected (ever
the company man).  A punk rock dress is turned into a fishing net; figure
skates are used as cutting tools, and eventually, for dental surgery; video
cassettes provide binding material.  A volleyball, marked with Chuck's own
handprint in blood, looks like a face and becomes Chuck's confident, Wilson.
All the while, though, that precious picture of Kelly beckons and Chuck
knows survival isn't enough - he has to attempt to save himself or die
trying.
"Cast Away's" already gathered reams of press during its production
due to the unusual nature of its shooting schedule.  First, Hanks gained
weight, ballooning over 200 lbs.  The first half of the film was shot,
then went on hiatus as Zemeckis went off and made "What Lies Beneath,"
while Hanks dieted almost fifty pounds off his frame and let his hair
and beard grow wild.  (The transition is handled unimaginatively in
the film with a 'four years later' title card.)
Hanks deserves a lot of credit for tackling this role, not only for the
physical hardships he endured.  Yes, it's Best Actor nomination (and
possibly a third win) time for America's favorite thespian again.  For
almost two hours of the film's 140 minute running time, Hanks is alone.
His Chuck Nolan begins the film as a company guy who's always too on the
move to stop and smell the roses.  While he truly loves Kelly, he has
trouble expressing emotion.  On the island, he goes through hope, despair,
frustration, industriousness, creativity, cowardice and courage.  The
man brings tears to your eyes over a *volleyball*.  
Of the barely-there support, Hunt is fine.  Better is Nick Searcy as Chuck's 
buddy Stan, who's losing his beloved wife of many years to cancer.  Searcy is 
true support to Hanks, playing a man more in touch with life, ironically 
through approaching death, than pre-accident Chuck.  And let's not forget
Wilson, probably one of the best supporting inanimate object in film history.
Zemeckis' production is top notch, with ace lensing by Don Burgess ("What Lies
Beneath") and tight editting by Arthur Schmidt.  Alan Silvestri's score is 
simple, yet effective.  Screenplay by Willian Broyles Jr. shows provides nice 
grace notes, such as the (Guardian) angels' wings which embellish the 
one package Chuck doesn't open, providing a connection from film's opening to
closing.  Time is measured in seconds, then in months.
"Cast Away" is a reflection upon what's really important in life and 
a showcase for Hanks' acting abilities.

Wow, I feel like I've just returned from a long vacation. Either that or 
I was sitting out in the rain for a couple of hours.
Juicy dialogue graces a tasteful dinner scene early on, but soon enough 
nearly all discourse gets kissed swiftly goodbye as you and Tom brave 
the weather on a tiny isle some place in some stormy ocean.
Like living alone in the wild, the film is curious, adventurous and 
exciting at times and at others, plain as sand, uneventful.
However, it was the tail of the tale, the last 25 minutes, that left me 
marooned. Sorry, details will spoil, but it's as if the film itself, 
after careful loving attention, was rushed off, dropped from a plane 
into the ocean and cast away. That last bit plays like a full feature of 
its own that had been mercilessly cut to just short of a half hour and 
stapled to the end of this island picture.
Lastly, I'm not a one to harshly criticize any production for picking up 
a few extra bucks on product sponsorship, but this presentation is one 
long commercial that leaves a bitter aftertaste.
Flaws aside, Tom does a great job working with only sand, coconuts, and 
crabs.
I interviewed Director Robert Zemeckis a few months back. At that time 
he'd just finished production of "What Lies Beneath" which was created 
after the first half of "Cast Away" and before the second half, giving 
time for Tom Hanks to loose all that weight. Ford and Pfeiffer are also 
interviewed.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
The first hint of where "Cast Away" is headed comes with its title.
Instead of the one-word "Castaway," which conjures up romanticized fare
like "Swiss Family Robinson" or slapstick comedy like "Gilligan's
Island," the title is split into "Cast Away," as in cast away from
everyone and everything that ever gave you comfort. Further, the
handling of the production itself carries forth the theme, with the
filmmakers casting away the cinematic conventions generally employed to
manipulate an audience. Far from the kind of formulaic event movie we
usually get around the holidays, "Cast Away" is a nervy exercise in bare
bones storytelling.
It starts in a deceptively traditional fashion, as we meet Chuck Noland
(Tom Hanks), a fiercely dedicated FedEx troubleshooter who travels the
globe preaching the gospel of tight organization and effective time
management to employees. After returning from a successful trip to
Russia, Chuck prepares to enjoy Christmas in Memphis with his
girlfriend, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt, in an understated, winning
performance). But the festivities are interrupted when he is called away
to deal with a problem in Malaysia.
Soon after, Chuck sits in a company plane, gazing at an extra special
gift from Kelly  a stopwatch that once belonged to her grandfather,
with her photo on the inside  while the pilots try to navigate through
a horrific storm over the South Pacific. Suddenly, there is an explosion
and the aircraft crashes into the water below, hurling Chuck beneath the
wreckage. A life raft saves him and he eventually ends up on a small
island several hundred miles from the middle of nowhere.
After the plane crash, a harrowing, realistic sequence nearly as
terrifying as the one in "Fearless," the film's presentation style
shifts almost as radically as Chuck's circumstances. Director Robert
Zemeckis, working with Tom Hanks for the first time since "Forrest
Gump," takes no easy outs. Where the camera shifted relentlessly during
the Russian segment, mirroring the troubleshooter's agitated state of
mind, it barely moves once Chuck crawls onto the island. For the next
hour or so, there is no background music; no cutaways to loved ones
worrying back in Memphis, nothing but a stark, intelligent portrait of a
man trying to get by.
In interviews for the film, Tom Hanks acknowledged that some of the
creative team grew dispirited when "Survivor" became a TV phenomenon,
fearing that their years of hard work might be undermined by the game
show. In fact, "Survivor" probably helped the production by showing that
life on a beautiful tropical island is far more difficult that it looks.
After viewing the struggles of the 16 contestants, the notion of a man
facing such challenges alone seems even more daunting.
Hanks gained 30 plus pounds to prepare for the role. After the early
island scenes were shot, the film closed down for a year, allowing the
actor time to drop the weight. Hanks' physical transformation is quite
impressive, but his extraordinary acting makes it pale by comparison.
His performance is completely down to earth and unaffected. At no point
does it feel like we are witnessing an actor trying to writhe his way to
another Oscar. Instead, we simply watch Chuck try to find drinking
water, crack a coconut without tools and build a fire. His trials are
fascinating and his silence amplifies the gravity of the situation.
Once Chuck has taken care of his bodily needs, he must focus on staying
sane. He keeps the photo of Kelly on constant display, giving himself
someone to long for. Although he salvages a number of FedEx parcels and
makes smart use of their contents, he leaves one package unopened and
ready for delivery, giving himself a task that must some day be taken
care of. Not a spiritual man (when the body of a crew member washes
ashore, he buries it without prayer, looking at the makeshift grave and
flatly muttering, "Well, that's it."), Chuck recognizes that he must
have someone to talk to and comes up with an ingenious solution.
Ads for the movie make it clear that Chuck eventually returns to
civilization (I suspect Zemeckis revealed that piece of information so
that viewers would remain in the moment instead of fretting about
whether or not Chuck would ever get home). As for what happens, suffice
to say that the ending does not betray the integrity of what has come
before.
It will be interesting to see if mass audiences embrace "Cast Away."
Some may find the underlying world-view too bleak, but my guess is that
the goodwill Tom Hanks engenders will carry them through. By the way,
you'll need to set aside a little over two hours and 20 minutes for the
film, but rest assured, you will not be bored for a second.

_Cast_Away_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Given that _Cast_Away_'s entire story course is indiscreetly divulged in
its trailer, it is easy to blame the Fox marketing department for the air
of disappointment that comes with watching the film.  And, indeed, they
do shoulder a lot of the blame, for the story holds absolutely no
suspense for anyone who's seen the widely-played trailer; the outcome is
never in doubt, and at times it is possible for one to count the minutes
before certain already-known plot points occur.
That latter scenario is possible, but not probable, and that is due in
large part to Tom Hanks, who reteams with his _Forrest_Gump_ director
Robert Zemeckis for this ambitious drama.  A large portion of the film is
a one-man show, and Hanks more than pulls off the difficult, often
wordless task.  Since he has won so many awards for past work, it is
tempting for skeptics to turn their noses up and gag at the prospect of
yet another Oscar nomination for Hanks.  But his terrific work here,
coming with the seal of approval of the New York Film Critics Circle (who
awarded him their Best Actor trophy this year), is proof positive that he
is one of the most gifted and versatile acting talents of our time.  It
just so happens that he has won a number of accolades for past work and
that he is enormously popular with the general public.
Hanks plays Federal Express employee Chuck Noland, whose workaholic
tendencies tear him away from girlfriend Kelly Frears (a simply adequate
Helen Hunt) and onto a Malaysia-bound plane on Christmas.  The plane goes
down, as does everyone on the plane save Chuck, who is left to fend for
himself on a deserted island.  With only a volleyball companion named
Wilson by his side, Chuck undergoes a years-long emotional and
psychological transformation that is even more dramatic than his physical
one.
Zemeckis plays the engrossing Chuck-on-the-island meat of the film
perfectly--as in, as close to reality as possible.  There is no score,
just the ambient source noise of the largely sun-drenched setting.  He
and writer William Broyles Jr. also don't employ a voiceover or, even
worse, make Chuck think out loud; like anyone in his situation, Chuck
does utter a word here and there--mostly when overcome by emotion or
excitement--but for the most part, he remains silent.  Again, credit goes
to Hanks for clearly conveying those thoughts in his face without
speaking a single word.
As I have stated earlier, the Fox marketing department is not the only
target for blame over _Cast_Away_'s underachievement.  Make no
mistake--the film is a fascinating and thought-provoking entertainment,
propelled by one of the best performances of the year.  But it never
quite develops into the great film that it, at times, flirts with
becoming, and that is due to the script.  I won't pull a Fox myself and
give away how the film turns out, but the resolution of the film and to
the provocative issues it raises is rushed, overly tidy, and not
completely satisfying.  Instead of soaring from the strong buildup that
preceded it, the ending just coasts along on the good will it fostered in
the previous passages.
Who does soar, however, is Hanks, and his already-complex performance
just deepens in the final act.  On paper, there isn't much to Chuck, yet
the viewer grows to care a great deal about him.  Part of that can be
written off as a side benefit of Hanks' innate likability (which has
never been more valuable to a role), but like any great acting display,
Hanks fills in the blanks and brings the character to full-bodied life. 
_Cast_Away_ may  ultimately underachieve, but the soul that Hanks brings
to the role--and the film--must not be underrated.

Robert Zemeckis' CAST AWAY is a strong example of what can be done with a 
veteran actor and a pretty solid script.
Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, an executive for FedEx who is stranded on a 
remote island in the Pacific, is in top form, and the writing by William 
Broyles, Jr. tells the story without straining itself with worry over the 
premise.
Hanks is remarkable here.  Of course the story that will get the most 
attention is how he and his friend Bob Zemeckis suspended production halfway 
through the film, so that Hanks could shed 50 or so pounds and let his hair 
grow.  Sure enough, Chuck Noland reappears looking like John the Baptist, 
spearing fish expertly, even crouching like a native would  the survivor in 
the wild.  In every scene it seems like Hanks is not surrounded by a large 
crew;  he simply acts naturally, holding his expressive mouth and casting 
his expressive eyes in ways that engage us and always carry the plot 
further.  Perhaps he has not chosen widely different roles in his career, 
but Tom Hanks certainly assumes authority up there on the screen, and he 
just gets more watchable with the years.
The story is also one of the stars.  No, it will not interest viewers who 
demand intense action or explosions, though the plane crash sequence is very 
well executed and memorable.  I like that the script does not have Chuck 
Noland talking to himself unnecessarily.  When he talks or screams aloud, it 
is warranted;  when Noland needs to preserve his sanity, he creates a 
companion:  a package from the plane cargo, a volleyball he dubs `Wilson,' 
painting in a face with his own blood.  It's remarkable indeed that we 
actually begin to empathize with this volleyball, or at least with the 
traits with which Noland has personified it.  From the tragic opera of his 
marooning, Hanks is able to cause his character to sift comic moments  a 
nice touch and an optimistic stance from which to view the world.  Many 
stars attract an audience merely by attaching their names to a project;  
Hanks is the surest bet in modern Hollywood to deliver the goods.  Broyles' 
script, along with Zemeckis' subtle direction, gives this masterful actor 
the tools he needs.
Helen Hunt is, unfortunately, underused.  We saw her in the current Mel 
Gibson vehicle WHAT WOMEN WANT, and I remarked on the smallness of her part. 
  The script of CAST AWAY features Hunt even less.  What this fine actress 
needs is a narrative that will truly center on her, and not on the older men 
with whom she occupies a screen.  As Kelly Frears, Noland's love interest 
before his being lost, Hunt does her usual believable and efficient job, 
though we do not see much development of her character.
I wonder about viewers' reactions to the ending.  It struck me as not 
particularly satisfying, but I cannot say much about it without offering 
spoilers.  It reminds me of the endings of so many over-workshopped short 
stories that came out of college writing programmed students in the 1980's.  
The more I ponder the ending, however, the more I appreciate the importance 
of its metaphor.  Indeed, Zemeckis is unafraid of using metaphorical twists 
throughout the film, a decision that will alienate a good deal of viewers 
(who may not even be aware of the reason they are disgruntled!).
My judgment is that yes, films of high quality are scarce this season, if 
not this past year (2000).  My experience watching CAST AWAY (even the title 
smacks of metaphor, no?) provided me with an enjoyable mixture of 
entertainment and instruction, and are these two qualities not the ones that 
supposedly make good literature?
The film lasts 143 minutes, and is rated PG-13.  It has very few 
questionable uses of language, but a couple of intense sequences involving 
the plane crashing, and Noland finding the corpse of a crew member.

     Only a year ago, Cast Away would have been subject to unavoidable
and endless Gilligan's Island comparisons.  Now, it will never hear the
end of Survivor analogies, and that's too bad, because the film really
has no resemblance to either TV show.
     Cast Away is The Big Tom Hanks Movie of 2000, the latest in a long
line of Big Tom Hanks Movies that stretches back to include The Green
Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, and Philadelphia. 
However, Cast Away has the distinction of being the only Tom Hanks Movie
to star no one but Tom Hanks.
     Just about, anyway.  As you've undoubtedly heard, Cast Away largely
concerns Hanks' character Chuck Noland, stranded and forgotten on a tiny
island in the South Pacific after his plane goes down in the drink. 
Ruthless in business (living and dying "by the clock,"), yet deep down
kind enough to give you the shirt off his back, Noland is a FedEx
manager constantly jetting around the globe to fix things that go awry. 
And that means lots of plane time.
     In one of the most spectacular, realistic, and harrowing crash
sequences put to film, Noland's sudden Christmas Eve flight goes off
course and then plummets into the ocean, only hours after Noland has
handed a small, conspicuously ring-sized box to his earthbound
girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt).  Karma and Hollywood being what they are,
Noland survives the crash and winds up on the aforementioned island. 
And get comfy, because he's going to spend a long time there.
     Skeptics be damned, Cast Away's finest moments consist of Hanks
alone with his surroundings.  I never thought it would be any fun to
watch Mr. Gump parade around on the beach solo, but it simply is, a
testament to the man's serious acting chops.  As Noland figures out how
to survive against impossible odds -- from opening a coconut to making a
fire to collecting fresh water to drink to dealing with a toothache -- I
found immense satisfaction in viewing his daily rituals.  The actual
experience of being on that island would be unfathomable and
unbearable.  To have turned it into a very watchable movie is
unthinkable.  And yet they've done it.
     I'm not giving anything away that isn't part of the trailer by
saying that, years later, Noland escapes his gulag, whereupon he must
come to terms with a world that has cast him away (get it?). 
Unfortunately, once Hanks is back in civilization, the movie completely
bogs down with soulful soliloquies, mainly between Noland and his lost
girl Kelly, who has had to move on with her life.  None of this epilogue
offers anything in the way of surprise, mainly because director Robert
Zemeckis cuts out what stood to be the most thrilling part of the film
-- the first month that Hanks spends back in civilization.  I mean, if
you spent four years alone on an island, do you know how seriously
fucked up you'd be?  Hell, I start to itch if the TV is off for an hour.
     But in Cast Away Hanks is a longhaired near maniac one minute.  The
next he's shaved and fine, with a little insomnia and sun-bleached hair
his only apparent problems, mental or physical.  You could have made an
entire film about his reconditioning.  Or you could have just ended it
when he makes his escape.  Anything but this hour of padding that
leeches from what is otherwise an emotional tour de force.
     It is certain that Hanks's name will be up in lights again come
Oscar nomination time.  The same can't be said for Helen Hunt, an
unfortunate casting mistake whose innate, hard-assed unlovability makes
you wonder why Noland was interested in her to begin with.
     Ultimately, Cast Away rests wholly on the strength of its second
act and its leading man.  The supporting cast, the editing, the
camerawork -- everything else is completely swept aside to make way for
our survivor.  And that's funny, because if you'd told me yesterday that
Tom Hanks, a movie camera, and a whole lot of nothin' would be the
recipe for great cinema, I'd have told you to take a flying leap in the
ocean.

CAST AWAY, which brings together FORREST GUMP's team of star Tom Hanks 
and director Robert Zemeckis, is nothing less than the best movie of the 
year.  And with tremendous poignancy and honesty, Tom Hanks delivers the 
best performance of the year.  A harrowing and deeply moving story, it 
is the scariest movie in years, not in a manipulative or artificial way 
but with incidents of genuine beauty and terror.  When you're not on the 
edge of your seat, you'll be jumping off of it.  But it is a rewarding 
film, not some cheap thrill, that makes you rethink what's important in 
life as well as how hard basic survival can be.
When we meet Chuck Noland (Hanks), he's a FedEx efficiency expert who is 
teaching Russian employees how to worship the clock god with the same 
religious fervor that he does.  Back home in Tennessee, Chuck has an 
almost fiancée, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  Hunt, who seems to be in every 
recent film, is an actress of whom you can never get enough.  With 
little screen time, she develops Kelly into an extremely sympathetic 
character.  The role could easily have been a throwaway since this is 
essentially a one man picture.  Well, there is also a volleyball, but 
more on that later.
Before Chuck leaves for Russia, we watch in flashback as he and Kelly 
exchange Christmas gifts.  He gives her a pager, and she gives him her 
grandfather's Southern Pacific pocket watch with her picture inside of 
it.  He promises to always keep it on "Memphis time, Kelly time."  These 
presents are exchanged in the exactly two minutes that he asks the FedEx 
flight to wait for him.  Promising, "I'll be right back," he leaves on 
his "brief" trip.
I've been in an airplane that went into freefall, and there is no more 
frightening experience.  Our plane pulled out in time, but Chuck's 
didn't.  The airline disaster is the first of many times that you'll be 
gripping yourself, your armrest, your companion or all three.  Don't be 
surprised if you scream.  This, however, is far from the last such 
experience that you will have while watching CAST AWAY.  
Self-administered dentistry and simple injuries will be others.  Even 
Zemeckis's recent WHAT LIES BENEATH isn't nearly as frightening as CAST 
AWAY because the former film was just a movie whereas CAST AWAY plays 
more like real life.  
After the plane crashes somewhere in an area of the Pacific ocean twice 
the size of Texas, Chuck ends up on a large, rocky island with no 
inhabitants.  Some FedEx packages wash up on shore with everything from 
ice skates to videotape.  Eventually he manages to put everything to 
good use, but daily survival becomes a tricky proposition.  Foraging for 
food and trying to create a fire prove much harder than you might 
suspect.
Chuck's Man Friday comes from a birthday present being mailed to a young 
boy.  Inside the box is a Wilson Sporting Good's volleyball, which Chuck 
calls Wilson after painting a face on it.  In order to keep his sanity, 
he bonds with the ball and loves it more than any pet.  This allows 
writer William Broyles Jr. (ENTRAPMENT) to have Chuck speak without 
having to resort to voice-over.  Hanks's body gestures and his limited 
conversation with Wilson tell the bulk of the story.  If you've 
foolishly harbored any doubts whatsoever about Hanks's acting ability, 
this movie will remove them.  It is a one man show in which we never 
tire of him.
After weeks on the island, the story jumps ahead four years in which an 
emaciated -- the filming was put on hold for 16 months so that Hanks 
could shed over fifty pounds -- and sullen Chuck labors away on his 
island prison.
While we are on the island, Zemeckis lets no background music spoil the 
feeling of being alone in nature.  A serious movie, it does provide some 
comedic flourishes to make it less difficult to watch.  
This story of a control freak who loses all hope of control after being 
lost in the wilderness is a hard one to end properly.  But to the 
writer's credit, he manages to make the end almost as gripping and 
successful as the rest of the picture.  Only in the unnecessary 
proclivity to too neatly tie up loose ends in the last scene or two does 
the movie ever fail us.
If they ever release a five hour director's cut of the movie, I'm there.  
It's that kind of story.  It could not be more absorbing.  We were only 
able to witness a small part of Chuck's 4 years stuck in his hellish 
paradise of an island.  We'd love to know more.  Still, we will always 
treasure what we learned when we were vicariously incarcerated there 
with him.
CAST AWAY runs 2:23 but feels shorter.  It is rated PG-13 for intense 
action sequences and some disturbing images.  It would be acceptable for 
teenagers, but the movie is likely to frighten most viewers regardless 
of age.

It's a shame that the movie studios had to give away this film's ending in
the trailer. An utter shame. I would have liked to been surprised by what
happened. I would have wanted to go in knowing as little as possible about
the circumstances surrounding the end of this movie, but nooooo, they
wouldn't hear of it. Ugh, I hate when studios mess up my movie experience
like that. Oh well, all the same, I still went to see this movie hoping to
enjoy it, even with the knowledge about its conclusion. I hope that anyone
who goes to see this movie knows as little as possible about the film. It
would be to your advantage. Trust me.
PLOT:
A man consumed by time in his own day-to-day life gets into a major plane
crash, leaving him stranded alone on an island. The movie basically follows
his journey as he attempts to survive and escape the lonely clutches of
island life.
CRITIQUE:
Can a movie that spends about 80% of its runtime alone on an island with one
man actually not be boring? You bet. Especially when it manages to make you
feel as though you are stuck on that very island with him. Here we have a
movie that does not play by the rules of Hollywood. There are no major
sweeping scores or soundtracks. There are no cute supporting players, or
breakout performances by the latest ingenues coming out of Tinseltown. This
film puts you through one of the most authentic plane crashes ever witnessed
on the big screen, and then just as effectively, strands you on an island
with a man just like any other. The journey you take with that person is an
interesting one, and one that held my attention throughout. I honestly
expected to be bored at some point. I was waiting for the whole stint on the
island to weigh down on me or for me to begin counting the number of people
in my theatre, but I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of this film and the
gradual manner in which they allowed its story to build. The film is also
loaded with ironies, of which I am a big fan. But with any film such as
this, chances are that not everyone will be a fan. There is obviously very
little dialogue in the movie, and you're basically living day-by-day with
Tom Hanks, so if he or his predicament doesn't interest you, you're not
likely to care much about any of the film. But it worked just dandy for me.
It's just too bad that I knew how it was gonna end up because of the crappy
trailer that the studios put together (read my complete tirade above),
otherwise the story might've held some suspense in it for me as well.
On the downside, I didn't really get too emotional about the movie. Hanks'
character was interesting to watch, mesmerizing to follow and fulfilling to
witness growing, but I didn't feel much for him, or anyone, at the end of
the movie. Was I supposed to? I think so. I think the story is supposed to
show us how we really don't take the time to appreciate the little things in
our lives, and even though the film does give you a real sense of that, the
relationship element didn't really gel for me. Having said that, the film
still comes through as one of the more original movies of the year, and the
direction by Zemeckis is top-notch. See the movie for its realistic
portrayal of life alone on an island, the terrifying plane crash, the
various adventurous escape attempts by Hanks and even for his performance,
which despite being mostly non-verbal, comes through once again. BTW, the
FedEx company should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor in this film.
Wow. Has there ever been a product placement used so entirely as part of a
movie? Incredible.

It's a shame that two of the year's best films were ruined by a
promotional trailer that gave away too much of both stories.  It's an
even bigger shame that both movies were directed by the same person -
Robert Zemeckis.  Is it a coincidence? Beats me.  What is known is that
his previous film, What Lies Beneath, took nearly an hour-and-a-half to
reveal plot points that the trailer showed months before the film was
released. So much for the red herring in that one.
Cast Away offers more of the same shenanigans.  The two-minute preview
shows a plane crashing into the Pacific Ocean and its lone survivor
washing up on the shores of a deserted island.  He has to rough it 
Lord of the Flies style  but eventually makes it home, much to the
surprise of his friends and family, who all assume he died in the crash.
So why would anybody want to venture out into the cold and spend money
to sit in a dark room to watch a film whose ending is no secret?  The
answer is simple  Tom Hanks.  People seem to like the guy an awful lot,
and he acts his ass off in Cast Away, where he plays Chuck Noland, a
slightly puffy Memphis-based Federal Express employee who spends most of
his time on the road training international branches of his company.
Cast Away opens with several scenes that don't seem necessary but play a
vital role in the film's final reel.  The first act sets up Chuck's
hectic life and relationship with girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt, Pay it
Forward).  It's Christmas Day, and Chuck gets a page to jet off to
Tahiti, postponing a planned proposal to Kelly until New Year's Eve.
"I'll be right back," he tells her, but we all know better.
The plane crash is as intense as anything you've seen lately, especially
if you've been watching election coverage on CNN.  Because Chuck's pilot
flew 200 miles off course to avoid a storm (which also conveniently left
the craft unable to make radio contact with the ground), any search
efforts made won't be anywhere near his new island home.
On the island, Chuck has to abandon his "live and die by the clock"
lifestyle in favor of finding things like food, water and shelter.
Before long, he's doing fire dances, painting on cave walls and
searching the sky for clues about the tide, just like our
knuckle-dragging, monosyllabic forefathers (and I don't mean the Bush
family).  This isn't your typical Hollywood deserted island, either.
There are no drug farmers (like The Beach), no headhunters (like
Gilligan's Island) and no naked fat guys (like ... you know).
Chuck is kept alive by the contents of several packages from the FedEx
crash that wash up on the shore of his island, one of which provides the
castaway his only friend and confidant - a volleyball he calls "Wilson"
(which I'd have eaten - leather is as close to steak as you'd get on a
deserted island).  This middle part of Cast Away is over an hour long
and features no music and very little dialogue (the least in a film this
length since The Thin Red Line).  It's all Hanks, and he does a very
admirable job.
Zemeckis pulls off his best directorial effort yet, and that's quite a
statement considering the films he already has under his belt.  He mixes
in a bunch of the long tracking shots that we've come to expect, and the
transitions between his scenes are typically amazing, but the director
makes his greatest contribution to Cast Away by leaving important pieces
of the story out of the film.  Scenes that you expect to see are
missing, but he's a strong enough storyteller to fill in the blanks in
other ways.  He even mounts a camera to a FedEx package to show its
delivery journey.  Now, if we can just get somebody to edit Zemeckis'
trailers a little more carefully, he'll be in business.
Hanks may also have reached his career zenith with his performance in
Cast Away.  After all, not just any actor can carry a film with this
little action and dialogue.  Much has been made of Hanks' weight gain
and loss for the film (it was filmed in two segments so he could lose
several dozen pounds), but his physical appearance takes a backseat to
his acting, which is quite smashing considering his costar was a
volleyball.  If you put Joaquin Phoenix on an island with only a round
piece of leather, nothing remotely exciting would happen.
And what's with poor Helen Hunt?  She was in one of the biggest
blockbusters ever (Twister) and won an Oscar (As Good as it Gets) while
she appeared on television's Mad About You.  Since abandoning the sitcom
(which she did, presumably, to make films), she's spun her wheels with
strong performances in shaky projects like Dr. T and the Women and
Forward.  Now, Hunt has finally found a film to match her acting
ability, and she's barely in it.
2:13  PG-13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images

  Along with a sure-fire Oscar nomination, Tom Hanks gets my
vote for this year's REAL "Survivor." In this contemporary Robinson
Crusoe tale, Hanks plays a busy FedEx executive who waves good-bye to
his girl-friend , Helen Hunt, saying "I'll be right back."  They've
just exchanged Christmas gifts. She gave him her grandfather's pocket
watch with her photo inside and he gave her a little, square jeweler's
box, presumably an engagement ring. Then there's the harrowing agony
of a terrifying plane crash, and Hanks washes ashore on a tiny,
deserted speck of an island in the Pacific Ocean. How will he find
water, food and shelter with nothing but the clothes he's wearing, a
scavenged flashlight and the contents of FedEx boxes strewn on the
beach? Using ingenuity, he turns ice-skate blades into knives,
videotape into rope, dress material into a fishing net and
triumphantly builds a fire. With his own blood, he paints a face on a
volleyball and it becomes his companion named Wilson. But even more
important than his grueling physical and mental endurance is his
metaphysical meditation in the solitary silence and his eventual
transformation from a selfish, time-obsessed workaholic into a
thoughtful, mature man, fully capable, four years later, of coping
with a challenging crossroad of choices. Actor/producer Tom Hanks and
director Robert Zemeckis, who collaborated on another Everyman journey
called "Forrest Gump," superbly craft this risky, often humorous film
and, along with writer William Broyles Jr., they are as distinguished
for the paths not chosen, the pitfalls avoided. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Cast Away" is an intense, ironic, insightful 10 -
one of the 10 Best Pictures of the Year. It's not just a movie - it's
an experience.

        In "Cast Away," Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a time-obsessed
Federal Express executive who tells his girlfriend (the ubiquitous Helen
Hunt) one Christmas Eve that he'll be right back, crash lands somewhere in
the Pacific, and spends the next four years of his life on a remote desert
island conversing with a volleyball.
        The film re-teams the star of "Forrest Gump" with that film's
director, Robert Zemeckis.  "'Gump" won six Oscars, including Best Picture,
and "Cast Away" looks like it has a pretty good shot at repeating that
film's success, again because of the strength of its acting, a bold script,
and mature direction.  "Cast Away" is a modern day Robinson Crusoe on paper
but director Zemeckis avoids a lot of easy pitfalls, strengthening the
emotional experience in the process.  There's no Man Friday, no cuddly
animals to interact with and, unlike that Harrison Ford/Anne Heche comedy
"Six Days Seven Nights" from two years ago, no threatening pirates. 
There's also no rousing music score punctuating the action at every
opportunity.  There's just Tom Hanks at odds with, and at one with, nature.
        The popular star of "Saving Private Ryan," "You've Got Mail," and
last year's "The Green Mile" is terrific in "Cast Away," especially since
he spends much of the film's 143 minutes (which simply zip by) saying very
little, reacting to the elements around him, trying to survive.  And
survive he does.  But at what cost?
        The film plays out in three distinct acts: the setup, in which we
learn about Chuck Noland's relationship with Kelly (Hunt) and how
everything in his life absolutely, positively needs to be calculated right
down to the millisecond; the middle act, in which Chuck must learn to
survive, alone, at the edge of the world--find food, water, and shelter,
avoid going mad; and the conclusion, in which he has to face those who have
long since considered him dead (no real spoiler here, since the trailers
have long since tipped us off in that department).  The emotional content
is at its strongest in the third segment, when the film makes us appreciate
how much we take for granted.  In a lesser film these realizations would
appear pat and obvious; in "Cast Away," they feel integral and genuine. 
Hunt isn't in the film much, but she easily earns her paycheck in these
climactic scenes.
        That volleyball, by the way, is one that Chuck finds wrapped inside
one of several FedEx packages that wash up on the beach.  He paints a face
on it and calls it Wilson, occasionally participating in one-sided
conversations with his round leather friend.  It's a clever idea that
provides a way for the audience to know what Chuck is thinking without the
use of an intrusive voiceover.
        "Cast Away" is no ordinary film.  In fact, both Zemeckis and Hanks
do extraordinary work here.  Together they have taken William Broyles,
Jr.'s screenplay and transformed it into an experience that truly resonates.
