(1991) ** - C:Eric Roberts, F. Murray Abraham, Mia Sara.
Finally, a movie about the exciting sport of fencing! Fencing? Swordfighting
without any of the danger? Oh boy.
Eric Roberts stars as a fencing instructor, a former olympic fencing
champion who retired from competition undefeated. His class that he
instructs in the film includes all the standard type characters for this
kind of film: the cocky guy, the sensitive guy, the girl who wants to prove
she's more than a girl, etc. These characters just end up as scenery,
however, as the main plot revolves around the school's janitor (Abraham).
In the film's opening scenes, Abraham comes to Roberts and asks if there are
any teaching positions open. Roberts quickly tests his skills, laughs, and
offers him a position as a janitor. Abraham, humiliated, takes the job.
Later, we learn that Roberts' father was also a great champion fencer, and
was killed in a duel over a woman many years earlier. Moments after, we
learn that Abraham has just been released from jail after serving a sentence
for murder. Hmmm, I wonder if there's a connection there? I wonder...
The film really goes nowhere for a while, and then leads up to the
inevitable "revelation" and climatic sword fight. The duel itself is well
staged, but the purpose of it seems a bit ridiculous. With some minor script
changes, however, the sword fight could have had much more relevance.
Roberts, who appears to be doing his own fencing, does a good job with his
character.
