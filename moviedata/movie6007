(1983) **1/2 - C:Charles Bronson, Andrew Stevens, Wilford Brimley.
Charles Bronson is a cop who likes to do things his own way. Yes, I know
that basically describes every movie Bronson has ever made. "Ten to
Midnight" surprisingly though, has some originality to it.
The film is your basic "Cops-chasing-a-serial-killer" story, but halfway
through it takes an interesting turn. The cops catch the bad guy on a lesser
charge of stalking, and even though everyone knows that he's the killer, no
one can prove it. So Bronson plants evidence in the killer's apartment while
he's in jail. This doesn't work and eventually Bronson gets caught. As a
result, the killer is set free. Then Bronson decides to turn the tables and
he starts stalking the killer!
That aside, there are just too many things about the film which prevent it
from getting a good rating. It's cheaply made. The scenes which depict the
murders are done without any style and instead are just a gratuitious as any
slasher film. And the title apparently has no meaning whatsoever. I guess a
studio head thought it sounded good. Still, a decent attempt.
