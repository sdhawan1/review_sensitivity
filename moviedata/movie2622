    The film begins with a dizzying introduction into the life of Queens
garbage man Simon Grim. James Urbaniak (Simon) gives a controlled but
captivating performance, his eyes and lanky body creating Simon as a missing
link between Sam Beckett and Marlon Brando. The sight of ex-con Henry Fool
marching down the street signals the end of this quiet, unremarkable life.
Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry) is rowdy, crude, and becomes surprisingly
sympathetic
in his Mephistophelean role.
Henry first finds Simon placing an ear to the ground, as if listening
for the approaching
steps of fate. `Get up off your knees.' -- Henry commands as he swiftly
moves himself
into the Grim family basement and into the lives of Simon's sex-dependant
sister
(Parker Posey), and morbidly depressed mother (Maria Porter). Henry claims
to be finishing
his 혩Confessions', which he is convinced will provoke and thrill the
literary establishment.
He offers a spare notebook to the monosyllabic Simon, telling him to stop
and write down
what he can't seem to express in conversation. When Simon's book length poem
becomes
infamous almost overnight, Henry and his unaccomplished 혩Confessions' are
left
in the shadows.
The second half of the film concentrates mainly on Henry; Hartley opens
things up to breathe, after focusing almost claustrophobically on Simon's
evolution from
garbage man to controversial poet. Henry is faced with personal failure, and
the looming
obligation of someone so aware of life, society, and his surroundings.
Like the films of Robert Bresson, or J.L. Godard, emotion and human
relation are heavily
dealt with, although not thoroughly expressed thru any individual source,
but as a
constructed whole. The film can be seen as a modern fable, a performance art
piece. Each
frame is so carefully designed and controlled, it's undeniable this story
could only be told in
film. The 혩World of Doughnuts' which Henry & Simon frequent is photographed
uniquely for
each scene, creating a totally ordinary, yet nearly undefinable space. Like
Godard, Hartley's
films can be taken as film-criticism. Almost in antithesis to films like
Armageddon, takes are
long and static. Characters interact in abstract but never embellished
dialogue. The screen
comes alive with stylized, almost modern dance choreography equal to his
earlier `Flirt'.
Is it a good movie? Yes. There's enough scatological humor and mediation
on creativity and morality to touch most segments of the audience, although
some might
find the 2-hour plus running time excessive, or the style too ironic and
detached. Surprisingly
"Henry Fool" is Hartley's largest, most accessible, and complex film to
date. It's a fantastic
accomplishment for him and will easily be oneof the best films of the year.

HENRY FOOL (Sony Pictures Classics) Directed by Hal Hartley
Simon can feel something's on the way. Standing in the street near his
home in Queens, Simon puts his ear to the ground and picks up the sound
of Henry's footsteps, coming steadily down the street. The peripatetic
Henry brings with him a message, part of which is revealed in the first
words he says to Simon: "Get up off your knees."
Aptly named, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) is a garbageman whose mouth is
a frozen frown. With his rigid hair, unflattering glasses and mousy
manner, Simon is the kind of man who feels he has to tell people "I'm
not retarded," since his demeanor suggests otherwise. Henry Fool (Thomas
Jay Ryan) is Simon's polar opposite, a verbose, passionate wanderer who
seeks out new worlds to conquer. Henry is in the process of writing his
"confession," a multi-volume autobiography that he promises will "blow a
hole right through the world's own idea of itself" when it's published,
and, at Henry's urging, Simon puts pencil to paper and creates a poem so
controversial it divides first his community, then the literary world.
"Henry Fool," which won writer-director Hal Hartley the prize for Best
Screenplay at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is a deft, sometimes
perplexing comedy-drama that stubbornly refuses to bow to convention or
to soft-sell its darker, more upsetting aspects in the name of drawing a
wider audience. And why compromise anyway? It's stories like this one
that put the "independent" back into "independent film."
Hartley has crafted a demanding, sometimes funny, sometimes bleak tale
of a houseful of people thrown off-balance by fate's unexpected twists
and turns. In the beginning, Simon is the kind of guy who appears to
have never gotten a break in life: He always looks like someone has just
offended him. Henry, with the quizzical face of a big suspicious cat and
eyes like lasers, sees the potential within this underachiever and
forces it out. Simon's loud-mouthed, promiscuous sister Fay (Parker
Posey) likes to pretend she's much younger and sexier than she really
is, and she's perturbed when Henry doesn't automatically make advances
on her. Fay and Simon's mother (Maria Porter) spends most of her days
stretched out on the couch, although it's never clear if she's actually
sick or just a hypochondriac who wants attention. By the time the
quartet's story wraps up, nearly a decade later, personalities will have
evolved, fortunes will have reversed and births, deaths and disclosed
secrets will have changed everyone markedly.
Ryan, in his film debut, is made to walk a thin line. Henry has a
florid manner of speech that suggests an overeager salesman, and his
penchant for posing is reminiscent of a self-involved drama student
who's always "on." The temptation in creating such a personality is to
play him like, well, a fool. But Henry must also serve as the core of
the movie, the sun around which all the space cadets revolve. Ryan
manages to have it both ways, letting us see just enough of what's
beneath Henry's bluster to make his character arc seem credible.
An even greater challenge falls to Urbaniak, who must come up with a
way to make the often silent, vaguely menacing-looking Simon someone the
audience can identify with on a certain level. Urbaniak finds the key in
Simon's resilience, the fact that even though he's stuck in an awful
situation, he's putting up with it because he feels responsible for his
family. "Henry Fool" also marks a new high point in the meteoric career
of Posey, whose Fay matures from bratty slut into hard-won womanhood
with humor and pathos.
Hartley's script always catches the viewer a little off-guard.
Everytime you think "Henry Fool" is about to settle into a safe comedic
groove, it takes a tragic or shocking detour, and just when the movie
starts to seem morose, Hartley throws in a bit of off-the-wall humor.
There's also a strain of satire running below the surface, as evidenced
by recurring references to a Congressman who claims to be devoted to
restoring American morals: His most vocal supporter turns out to be a
former drug dealer who beats his wife and daughter while praising his
candidate's high ideals. "Henry Fool" seems slightly overlong at 138
minutes, but it's difficult to come up with much material that could be
easily trimmed. That, in and of itself, is a pretty high compliment to
Hartley and his outstanding cast.

HENRY FOOL *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers, wchamber@netcom.ca
(Now with TRIVIA; film, DVD, LD reviews; a section where YOU can

fabric softener; and much more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
It is often said by his fans that Hal Hartley movies are an acquired
taste. Indeed. While perhaps less dangerous
than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping, they require no less amount of
physical stamina and concentration. I felt
rewarded at the end of HENRY FOOL; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow
139 minutes, I mean creeps-and
despite the final shot's ambiguity, I left completely satisfied.
Henry Fool ("used to have an 혩e'") arrives at garbageman Simon Grim's
house, claims the vacant basement
apartment, and almost instantly inspires Simon (Urbaniak) to take up
writing-Henry (Martin Donovan look-alike
Ryan) is an ex-convict, a once-great author who has been "exiled and
marginalized" by the publishing community
because of his criminal activity. Simon's poetry turns him into a local
sensation, as it causes mute women to sing,
high-school girls to swoon, and councilmen to rile against its
"pornographic" content. Meanwhile, Henry seduces
both Simon's dependent mother (Porter) and immature sister (Sundance
Queen Posey) with philosophical babble
(which is by turns brilliant and inane) and breathy animal lust. These
story elements result in climaxes both
inevitable and unpredictable; the teacher-student relationship formed
between Henry and Simon eventually
reverses itself.
HENRY FOOL is sprinkled with Hartley-ian flourishes: Simon drinks milk
from "Udderley's"; the big teen
hang-out is called "World of Donuts"; Simon wears his garbageman's
uniform throughout; the editing style is
decidedly elliptical... (which is key to the conclusion's said
ambiguity). The performances by the three leads are
abrasive at first, self-consciously "quirky"; the introductory scenes
are a chore. These people do grow on you
because they convey genuine passion, a belief in themselves, and because
they have long-term goals; Henry and
Simon may drink a lot of Budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner, but
they aren't pop slackers. The story is
rather classical: the tutor is a better talker than a doer, raised on
books; the timid tutee has innate talent his master
only dreams of. (Shades of film school...) The finished film is epic in
its proportions for a story so small, and the final
third does test one's patience, yet HENRY FOOL is tight, hardly
excessive in its length. How refreshing to see a
movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character. And unless I
nodded off, not a single building exploded.
This, Hartley's seventh feature, is contemplative about "the artist";
fortunately, we never get a sampling of
Simon's work, and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that
by the end we can surmise what sort of
thoughts would pour from these writers' pens.

>From what I've seen of Hal Hartley (which is mighty meager: out of about
10 films, I've seen only "Trust"), his films seem to steer deftly away
from potential annoying smugness and being like every other quirky,
indie film out there.  Yes, Hartley suffers from some smugness, mostly
due to his fast-paced brand of Hartley-speak, which only a few actors
can speak comfortably and convincingly, but he, in an almost ingenius
fashion, has created a bizzaro and original world that is still
inhabited by characters who seem, shockingly, genuine.  What may be
annoying to me about certain David Lynch films (save for "Eraserhead"
and "Blue Velvet") is nearly the opposite in his films: his characters
seem like real people suffering from strange idiosyncrasies and quirks
that only add to their humanity instead of detracting from it.  He
doesn't create random weird characters, existing only for a cheap laugh
- he creates funny characters with real problems and who feel basically,
more or less, real.  And this may be his big detraction when it comes to
modern day cult audiences, who have embraced Lynch as a savior of
independent film and pretty much shunned Hartley, reducing him to one of
those directors who makes films on a regular basis but never obtains
more than an elite group of fans who've accidentally stumbled upon his
films.
With "Henry Fool," though, he seems to have taken a giant step forward,
not only because his film ended up grossing a not-bad sum (of about two
or three million dollars, which means it played, if for only a brief
amount of time, in my hometown), but because it contains everything I
liked about "Trust" and improves on everything else that bugged me.
Like "Trust," "Henry Fool" is a bizarre comedy; a strange satire on
modern day life.  Unlike "Trust," its comedy is more subtle and more
tucked away underneath the text, allowing some of the more deeper
aspects to rise up and take control.  Not to mention, it's a masterfully
scripted film that doesn't seem to mind that it's nearly two and a half
hours long, allowing itself to unfold its story and its numerous
elements in a breezy, unforced manner and then expand on them.
With this film, he's trying new things, like doing away with some of his
more perverse dialogue rhythms (like Mamet and Stillman, Hartley has a
distinct pattern of writing that is instantly identifiable, and can also
sound horrific in the wrong hands), and allowing one of two major
characters to be damn near mute and the other to be incredibly verbal.
The latter is the eponomys character, Henry (newcomer Thomas Jay Ryan),
a bum who's just gotten out of prison, and settles into the basement of
the former, Simon (James Urbaniak), a bespeckled,
reserved-beyond-astonishment garbageman who lives with his sick,
prozac-addicted mother (Maria Porter) and his nymphomaniac sister
(Parker Posey), Fay.  Henry appears one day out of the blue and begins
to mingle with Simon almost immediately, acting like they were chums
from way back when.  Henry, with a skuzzy look, long brown locks, and
deep, dark eyes is a poet who believes that having a job rids one of the
time and energy to work on his art, and has long been working on his
epic poem, "Confessions," which he is near done with.  He speaks in
long-winded, complex phrases, and is completely oblivious to the
potential effect of his words and actions ("Look, Simon, I just slept
with your mother about a half hour ago and I'm beginning to think it
wasn't such a good idea.").
He takes Simon under his wing, whether he likes it or not, gives him
advice, like "It's good to do something you're ashamed of from time to
time," and one day hands him a notebook and tells him to write all his
thoughts out on paper.  In the morning, he's written an epic poem,
apparently without effort, and slowly, he becomes recognized.  Henry
begins to put excerpts of his poem in the local Chinese deli, and we see
how it effects people: at worst, people call it "pornographic;" the
opposite, a seemingly mute Chinese woman reads it and begins to sing
(wisely, Hartley never shows a smidgeon of the poem - here's to a new
McGuffin!).  Soon, the poem becomes an international obsession as it's
posted on the internet, and conservative and liberal folk are duking it
out over the importance of the poem as an artform.  Hartley could have
very well made this the point of the film, taking grand satirical
insights about the world of poetry, the importance of the artist in the
world, and various political notions, and to some effect he does (the
mere ridiculousness of how Simon becomes so popular so quickly is
handled in a subtle fashion, but still comically).
But he really makes it a film about the main characters and how Henry
affects them and how others affect Henry.  He's full of himself,
constantly preparing everyone for how phenomenal his final "Confessions"
will be like, but as great as he'll ever become is due mostly to the
popularity of Simon and the mere fact that he found him and got him
started, since Simon wouldn't have ever gotten farther than life as a
garbageman if Henry had never arrived.  Simon, as played by Urbaniak, is
like that of a weak but untroubled scrawny white guy, with a
non-judgmental look always given to everything, and sloppy posture that
makes him the immediate target of jokes and beatings.  He's never
affected by anything, as it seems, and his rampant popularity doesn't
seem to enthuse him a bit, at least in comparison to that of Henry, who
is not only happy for his friend, but proud that he has great taste.
And with Hartley's slow, reserved pacing, he brings out these elements
without bringing too much attention to them, and allows occurances and
insights to happen that only deepen the story.  Henry ends up having a
relationship with Fay, and it goes much farther than one would think at
the beginning.  And meanwhile, Hartley makes quick asides to social
commentary, as when he shows us the character of Warren (Kevin Corrigan,
making his indie rounds in this, "Buffalo '66," and "The Slums of
Beverly Hills"), a local bully turned right-wing activist turned
wife/child beater, who one day scoffs at himself, "The problem with this
country is people like me."  As with "Trust," all of this seems eerily
authentic and real depsite some of the more absurd and comical elements
- we care about the characters, and even, in some instances, sympathize
with them.  But what's so unique about this film, in comparison to
"Trust," is this one's more sly and more subtle.  It's reserved,
distanced tone works nicely with the film, and by showing the contrasts
between Henry and Simon, he's showing us infinitely more of his talent
for moviemaking.  He's making points about society that seem to only add
to the overall effect of the film instead of being distracting (let's
face it - that is, if you've seen "Trust" - the bit with the lonely
woman on the park bench was just time-wasting and you couldn't wait to
get back to the main storyline).  And his characters, though distanced
from us (we can never fully sympathize with Henry's lust for no life nor
Simon's total reservation from life), feel more realistic than in the
past (probably because we're not being forced to like them completely).
"Henry Fool," for the most part, is my favorite kind of independent
film: one that plunges you head-first into a strange world, makes no
cheap judgments about what you're seeing, and tells a story in such an
entertaining and insightful fashion that you can't help but be swept up
in it.  Let's just hope that Hartley has learned from this film, and
will continue to expand on the newfound successes that come from this
source.  Maybe sometime in the future, he'll end up making the great
film that will finally land him on the map and make other quirky indie
directors look like mere hacks.  Boy, will that be the day.

HENRY FOOL (director: Hal Hartley; cast: Thomas Jay Ryan, James
Urbaniak, Parker Posey, Maria Porter, Kevin Corrigan, 1998)
I was disappointed in Hartley's most ambitious film to date; I expected
more than what was delivered. The story is interesting enough, about a
passive, sexually repressed garbageman named Grim (Urbaniak), who is
content with his sullen life, and a disheveled drifter named Henry Fool
(Ryan), who we learn later on in the film has been released from prison
for child rape. He is articulate, full of mischievous zest, a scoundrel
passing himself off as an undiscovered writer. He influences Urbaniak to
write down his thoughts every day, and edits his work, and after they
are posted on a local deli's bulletin board, a high school newspaper
prints the poems and Grim gets a cult following. And as Urbaniak starts
to become known through the internet, and eventually wins the Nobel
Prize, Henry recedes to domesticity and obscurity. He also seduces
Urbaniac's nymphomaniac sister (Parker), who manages not to be as funny
as she ordinarily is (this is no fault of hers, the script is not that
funny for her part). He also seduces Parker's mother.
Henry Fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the good-guys
(non-conformist) versus the bad guys (the establishment). For Hartley
aficionados, his comedy is still there in flashes, his trademark drone
conversations and absurd situational humor: a marriage proposal takes
place between Henry and Parker while he is taking a wicked dump, this is
the best and most powerful scene in the film. But the film is boring at
times and belabors its points, and goes on for too long without seeming
to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction; and,
is at best, an uneven attempt to say something serious (which Hartley
should be applauded for). But the film gets bogged down in telling too
many different stories, such as, one of domesticity, neighborhood
values, and the business of getting published.
I wanted to like this film and I thought about why I didn't feel
comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie, and I
still found that what I got from the film were some chuckles from the
zany characters, but what I was not clear about, was what else I was
supposed to get from this film. It just didn't add up as a work of
drama, it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character.

Seen in July 1998 with Laura at the Angelika for $8.75
This completely down-and-out variation on *Down and Out in Beverly Hills*,
which in itself is a variation of *Boudu Saved from Drowning*, is a more
disastrous time for the people who get involved with the mysterious and
disheveled bum who drifts into their lives. Well, that's not completely
true. One person, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak), does benefit from the
fateful meeting, escalating from neighborhood weirdo to a 15-minute
celebrity whose porno poem delights the local teens in the World of Donuts
in Woodside, Queens, and enrage their parents.
Figuring out who is the less accomplished of the bunch is difficult.
There's Simon, who watches couples make out and gets beat up for it. Henry
Fool rants and raves, encouraging Simon to write while he doesn't seem to
do a whole lot of anything. Simon's sister Fay (Parker Posey) is the local
slut. Their mom mopes around the house in a depression. 
Yet there are some moments of inspiration. There are some selfless acts.  
Simon's perverse poetry (which we never ever hear read aloud) makes an
autistic girl speak, and helps him lift himself completely from his
milieu. And what a milieu it is. Suicides, child abuse, alcohol abuse,
intolerance, and more bodily fluids and flatulence than you can shake a
stick at. About 95% of the movie seems to be filmed on location in
Woodside, Queens (Laura and I looked at the street signs, I assure you).
Written and directed by indie great Hal Hartley, *Henry Fool* ambles
along, quiet and unpunctuated, a run-on sentence of a film. When your
moviegoing pal says, "I liked it but it was 45 minutes too long," it
confirms my opinion of the pace, but confounds me as to how anyone could
enjoy it fully. There are some truly funny and brilliant moments.
Cinematographer Michael Spiller does things with throwing things out of
focus I have not seen before, making things clear--with fuzziness.
Ubiquitous indie actor Kevin Corrigan (the male Parker Posey) appears
as Warren, one of the local outer borough intolerati.

Publish or perish
'Henry Fool' a charming epic about literary pretentions
You're not alone if you think the title of Hal Hartley's absorbing new film
`Henry Fool' sounds vaguely Shakespearean. It is, in fact, a title that
fits this raggedy, profane movie quite well, considering that Hartley's
themes here are ambition, vanity, morality and artistic vision. 
OK, Shakespeare it ain't. Still, Hartley -- the comic miniaturist who's
charmed thousands ... uh, hundreds with unorthodox, sometimes kinky little
dramas like `The Unbelievable Truth' and `Amateur' -- has created a
scruffy, immensely likable mini-allegory that should become his most
popular work. For the first time, Hartley has created a film that doesn't
feel like a sardonically diverting daydream. This one has charm and
substance.
Frustrated writers and unrecognized artists are likely to find a kindred
spirit in one of the two protagonists: a deadpan, withdrawn garbage man
named Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and a chain-smoking, greasy-haired mooch
named Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan).
As his surname suggests, young and tormented Simon leads a miserable kind
of life, living with his not-all-there mother and his haggard, sex-mad
sister Fay (indy film darling Parker Posey). Into this desperate household
walks Henry, a disheveled stranger, to rent the basement apartment. Henry
is a gabby Charles Bukowski wannabe who carries with him a grandiose
unpublished memoir he darkly calls his `confession,' a literary landmark
struggling to be born.
With Simon as his silent audience, Henry indulges in wild-eyed paranoia and
delusions of artistic importance. He uses a kind of reverse logic to state
his case: Since real artists are despised and isolated, then the despised
and isolated, a demographic in which both men count themselves, are the
world's artists and visionaries.
This inspires Simon to pick up the pen and begin writing his own opus. The
result is an epic poem that causes a visible reaction from anyone who reads
it. It becomes something of a sensation and, after a curt dismissal from a
vainglorious publisher, eventually propells Simon to the status of a young
lion of American poetry.
Curiously, in one of Hartley's more audacious artistic choices, we the
audience don't get even a taste of what is contained in Simon's poem or
Henry's memoir. We know these works only by the reactions they cause in
other people. In this way, we get to judge these `artists' by other means
than their creations.
Both lead actors are new to film and their freshness is intoxicating. As
Simon, James Urbaniak adopts a kind of stoic hostility to the world,
looking like a down-on-his-luck ex-member of Devo. It's a treat to see him
wrestle with the unfamiliar emotion of gratitude toward Henry, a reprobate
who clearly resents Simon's success.
Thomas Jay Ryan has the tastier role as the volcanic Henry and he clearly
dominates the movie from his first entrance. Ryan, an acclaimed
off-Broadway stage actor, gives Henry a rapacious alertness, a liar
convinced he is about to be exposed and the only way to save himself is to
build more lies. As the film progresses and Henry has to deal with Simon's
success, envy gives him an edge of unpredictability. The fact that we learn
Henry served time for having sex with a 13-year-old girl doesn't take an
edge off his charisma.
This super-charged relationship between these two losers, with the
complicating factor of Simon's sister Fay who literally brings Henry into
the family, moves the film forward whenever it threatens to sag. `Henry
Fool' is a comic epic about the power of the written word that doesn't
bother to show us a single written word. In the end, this film is more
about writers than about writing, about the fantasy of literary success
more than the reality of it. In that way, it's the unintentional biography
of literary pretenders everywhere from Shakespeare on down.

slut. Their mom mopes around the house in a depression. 
Yet there are some moments of inspiration. There are some selfless acts.  
Simon's perverse poetry (which we never ever hear) makes an autistic girl
speak, and helps him lift himself completely from his milieu. And what a
milieu it is. Suicides, child abuse, alcohol abuse, intolerance, and more
bodily fluids and flatulence than you might expect. Or perhaps you would.
About 95% of the movie seems to be filmed on location in Woodside, Queens
(Laura and I looked at the street signs, I assure you).
Written and directed by indie great Hal Hartley, Henry Fool ambles along,
quiet and unpunctuated, a run-on sentence of a film. When your moviegoing
pal says, "I liked it but it was 45 minutes too long," it confirms my
opinion of the pace, but confounds me as to how anyone could enjoy it
fully. There are some truly funny and brilliant moments.
Cinematographer Michael Spiller does things with throwing things out of
focus I have not seen before, making things clear with fuzziness.
Ubiquitous indie actor Kevin Corrigan (the male Parker Posey) appears
as Warren, one of the local outer borough intolerati. 
Original music by the director Hal Hartley.

I found this film in the new release section of my local video chain.  I 
selected it largely on the strength of its description as a "biting 
black-comedy".  Well, this film falls short as a comedy, but that complaint is 
really more of an indictment of the video marketers inability to pigeon-hole 
this strange little film than as a slam against HENRY FOOL itself. There are 
many parts of HENRY FOOL which are quite funny, the most memorable being when 
the title character Henry Fool's (Thomas Jay Ryan) replies "His throat was 
sore from the cigarettes" when confronted by his wife (Parker Posey) about the 
alcohol she smells on their 10-year old son. But the film is really an 
allegory about artistic expression and the catalytic effect that people have 
on each others lives.
The story relates the impact that stranger Henry Fool  has on the quiet, 
backward garbage-man Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and Simon's dysfunctional 
family and friends. Henry's passion for writing prompts Simon to begin writing 
on his own. Although it could use a little tighter editing, for the most part 
the film is well directed. The opening sequence cleverly  introduced Simon's 
name, not in dialog, but through the visually prominent name-tag on his work 
clothes. This little trick was then capitalized on in the scene in which Simon 
and Martin Fool first meet. However, while the direction was strong, the 
writing was weak. The title character is highly unsympathetic, which made it 
difficult to care about what happened to him.  Parker Posey's character Fay, 
although pivital to the story development,  was  shallow and one-dimensional. 
The other characters were even more cartoonish, a fact which ultimately sapped 
much of the dramatic strength from the final conflict leading to Martin Fool's 
downfall. Finally, a subplot dealing with the election of a right-winged 
Congressman was developed and seemed to be having an interesting impact on the 
minor characters when it was suddenly dropped in the last 30 minutes of the 
film. In short, I would classify HENREY FOOL as an interesting failure. 
However, even as a failure, the film had enough promise that I am looking 
forward to the next Hal Hartley directed film with a just a small bit of 
enthusiasm.  I give this film three out of five stars.

   Hal Hartley exhibits interests in "Henry Fool" that he
featured in his offbeat premiere movie, "The Unbelievable
Truth."  Combining melodrama with irony, Hartley's first movie
dealt with a mysterious man in black, often confused for a
priest, who called himself a garage mechanic and who
provoked discussion about his background all over town. 
Hartley now continues to explore the odd situation that occurs
within ordinary workaday lives with his current film--having
taken a wrong turn in his career three years ago with "Flirt," a
three-part tale telling the same dull story in three dull, similar
ways. Fortunately, "Henry Fool" is considerably more
entertaining and even accessible: almost.
   More theatrical than cinematic, "Henry Fool" is an ambitious
work, an attempt to pinpoint the American identity at this point
by use of a fable.  Hartley is influenced by sources as
distinguished as "Faust" and "Kaspar Hauser," and what's
more his latest work conjures up giants of the theater like
Harold Pinter and David Mamet as readily as Simon, a
nerdish and terminally shy garbage man, conjures up a
modern Mephistopheles.  While some viewers may have
reservations about its length, Hartley's subject matter and
imaginative treatment of several important themes justify the
time spent.  Surely, if "Godzilla" can hold its targeted
audience for over two hours, "Henry Fool" should have no
trouble doing the same for an intelligent constituency.
   Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan) is a charismatic personality
who appears in most scenes and serves as mysterious
mentor to a spiritually defeated trash man, Simon Grim
(James Urbaniak).  He shows up one day to rent a basement
space in the Grim household in much that a bum receives
shelter in an abandoned house in Harold Pinter's "The
Caretaker."  Both Pinter's and Hartley's creations are
frighteningly mysterious, making us curious about their
backgrounds and exerting a strong effect on those
who become parts of their circles.  Henry Fool immediately
senses his host Simon's lack of self-worth, though Simon is
a responsible person who takes care of two dependents: a
clinically depressed mother (Maria Porter) and a
nymphomaniac sister Fay (Parker Posey).  Despite his scruffy
appearance, Simon's new friend Henry speaks in a literary
style with a well-modulated voice, tells Simon that he is
completing a magnum opus called "Confessions," and
prompts Simon to get off his knees and begin writing.  No
sooner does Simon begin scribbling poetry furiously in a
notebook than Henry notices that his new pupil is spouting
iambic pentameter.  When Simon's poetry begins to find an
audience, Simon is reviled by some as a pornographer while
praised by others as a literary sage.  Henry urges Simon to
gain experience to bring further depth to the writing, but
Simon is already knee-deep in life, observing his promiscuous
sister's goings-on, his despondent mother's cynical
pronouncements, and his abusive neighbor's violence.  As
Henry's background is revealed, the movie loses some of its
edge.  As the enigma of the mysterious guest is bared, the
second half of the story waxes conventional.
   Like Jeremy Pikser and Warren Beatty's character
Bulworth, Hartley uses his people to satirize the family values
excesses that periodically threaten to take control of
America's political process.  Warren (Kevin Corrigan), who
regularly abuses his wife and stepdaughter, campaigns for a
reactionary Congressional candidate who uses his outward
decency to cloak his anti-immigrant views.  "Henry Fool,"
though, is not primarily a political tract but in the first instance
a fable that proves that we can reinvent ourselves while it
secondarily takes jabs at anti-progressive statesmen and the
culture of conformity.  Henry is a most likable villain, even
after we learn of his crime, a chain-smoking, serious man
given sympathetic depth by Canadian actor Thomas Jay Ryan
in his debut performance in a feature movie.  Long-haired,
bearded, and scruffy throughout, Ryan's Henry is a complex
individual whose psyche is carefully unravelled, fully exhibiting
his humanity as well as his flaws, while Hartley does likewise
for side characters like Father Hawkes (Nicholas Hope), a
doubter who advises Simon on financial dealings and the
ways of the world.  Parker Posey is striking as always, this
time in the role of a hard-assed, unhappy, unemployed but
attractive and chic siren who lives a love-hate relationship
with the title character.  James Urbaniak is just fine as a
nerdy trash man turned minstrel under the influenced of a
shady friend whose own background is irrelevant to his sway
over the young man.
   "Henry Fool" should be used by the dean of every liberal
arts college in America to show that there is far more to life
than being successful in a trade or profession.  The movie
lobbies for the potency of words, the ability of the rich, English
language to give life meaning even to the humblest of people
who subject themselves to its magic. Rated R.  Running time:
138 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998

    The film begins with a dizzying introduction into the life of
Queens garbage man Simon Grim.  James Urbaniak (Simon) gives a
controlled but captivating performance, his eyes and lanky body
creating Simon as a link between Sam Beckett and Marlon Brando. The
sight of ex-con Henry Fool marching down the street signals the end of
this quiet, unremarkable life.  Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry) is rowdy,
crude, and becomes surprisingly sympathetic in his Mephistophelean
role.
    Henry first finds Simon placing an ear to the ground, as if
listening for the approaching steps of fate. `Get up off your
knees.' -- Henry commands as he swiftly moves himself into the Grim
family basement and into the lives of Simon's sex-dependant sister
(Parker Posey), and morbidly depressed mother (Maria Potter). Henry
claims to be finishing his 혩Confessions', which he is convinced
will provoke and thrill the literary establishment. He offers a spare
notebook to the monosyllabic Simon, telling him to stop and write down
what he can't seem to express in conversation. When Simon's book
length poem becomes infamous almost overnight, Henry and his
unaccomplished 혩Confessions' are left in the shadows.
    The second half of the film concentrates mainly on Henry; Hartley
opens things up to breathe, after focusing almost claustrophobically
on Simon's evolution from garbage man to controversial poet. Henry
is faced with personal failure, and a looming obligation as someone so
aware of life, society, and his surroundings.  While the story is
admittedly modeled on Faust, both men proceed to their private heavens
and hells guided by trouble and desire.
     Like the films of Robert Bresson, or J.L. Godard, emotion and
human relation are heavily dealt with, although not thoroughly
expressed thru any individual source, but as a constructed whole. The
film can be seen as a modern fable, a performance art piece. Each
frame is so carefully designed and controlled, it's undeniable this
story could only be told in film. The 혩World of Doughnuts' which
Henry & Simon frequent is photographed uniquely for each scene,
creating a totally ordinary, yet nearly undefinable space. Like
Godard, Hartley's films can be taken as film-criticism. Almost in
antithesis to films like Armageddon, takes are long and
static. Characters interact in abstract but never embellished
dialogue. The screen comes alive with stylized, almost modern dance
choreography equal to his earlier `Flirt'.
    Is it a good movie? Yes. There's enough scatological humor and
mediation on creativity and morality to touch most segments of the
audience, although some might find the 2-hour plus running time
excessive, or the style too ironic and detached. Surprisingly its
Hartley's largest, most accessible, and complex film to
date. It's a fantastic accomplishment for him and will easily be
one of the best films of the year.
