   From Giuseppe Tornatore ("Cinema Paradiso"), this
coming-of-age W.W.II allegory is told from the perspective of a 13
year-old Sicilian boy who is sexually obsessed with Malena, the local
beauty played by Monica Bellucci. Set in the seaside town of
Castelcuto, the story begins as Mussolini rallies his
countrymen. While Il Duce's voice drones from every radio, the mind of
young Giuseppe Sulfaro concentrates only on fantasies of love and lust
for this young woman whose husband is off fighting. As the war
escalates, so does the town's disdain of Malena's voluptuous
appeal. First, she's rumored to be a hussy, the town tart. Then, after
her beloved husband is reported killed in North Africa, she's censured
for brazenly consorting with German soldiers, resulting in a spiteful,
brutal beating by an angry mob of women. Malena's beauty becomes her
curse. Throughout it all, Giuseppe watches her with dark, soulful eyes
from afar - either atop his bicycle or perched in a tree outside her
small villa. Based on a story by Luciano Vincenzoni, Tornatore's
screenplay switches abruptly and annoyingly from broad comedy to stark
tragedy, and his direction often echoes Fellini's "Amarcord," laced
with a frustrating overdose of sentimentality and Ennio Morricone's
over-blown score. But Bellucci and Sulfaro deliver appealing, if
wooden, performances, and fans of Tornatore's ability to evoke an
enchanted atmosphere of intimate, melancholy nostalgia, within a grand
scale of stucco, stone and local color, will find plenty of that. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Malena" is an idyllic, poignant,
sensual 6 - in Italian with English subtitles. And, if you missed
Tornatore's "Legend of 1900" (1999) about a piano virtuoso who lives
his life on a luxury ocean liner, rent the video.

MALENA (Italy, 2000) *** Directed and written by Giuseppe Tornatore 
from a story by Luciano Vincenzoni. Photography,  Lajos Koltai. 
Editing, Massimo Quaglia. Art direction, Francesco Frigeri. Sets, 
Bruno Cesari. Costumes, Maurizio Millenotti. Music, Ennio Morricone. 
Cast: Monica Belluci (Malena),  Giuseppe Sulfaro (Renato Amoroso), 
Luciano Federico (Renato's father), Matilde Piana (Renato's mother), 
Pietro Notarianni (Professor Bonsignore), et al.  A Miramax 
co-production and release. In Italian with subtitles. 94 minutes. R 
(sex, language)
                       .
Malena is the hypocoristic form of Madalena, but there is nothing 
diminutive about supermodel-actress Monica Belluci. She has appeared 
in two dozen films, Italian and French, all unknown to me save for 
"Under Suspicion" (USA, with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman) which I 
tried to watch but gave up.  They were mostly minor items, not 
imported in the USA. The few that were had minimal distribution.
A bit of history. Italy's Fascist leader (Il Duce) Benito Mussolini, 
has embroiled the country in World War II. In June 1940, as  France 
was about to surrender to Germany, Mussolini, kicking France when she 
was down, joined World War II with a ridiculous attack on the South 
of France. Earlier, Italy had swallowed tiny Albania. From it, in 
October 1940 it attacked Greece which was less than half the size of 
Italy, had about one seventh of its population, and a non-mechanized 
army. But David drubbed Goliath so spectacularly that Hitler, to 
rescue its ally Italy and save face, had to send his juggernaut to 
Greece, which it occupied in April 1941.
It is 1940 and the Italian civilians may remind you of the WWII song 
sung by Bette Davis, "They're either too young or too old." That's 
most of the male population of the Sicilian seaside town of 
Castelcuto. But all, from pubescent to elderly lust after gorgeous, 
27-year old Malena.
Whether or not "statuesque" applies to her, she is emphatically a 
sight to remember. Her husband is away in the army. She lives an 
almost reclusive life, has no apparent acquaintances. But whenever 
she walks in town (which is often), we recall those Vittorio de Sica 
movies in which Sophia Loren, in Naples and elsewhere, marches in 
provocative, camera-detailed fashion that makes all heads turn. Men 
compensate for their frustrated libido with nasty remarks. Jealous 
local women are ready with catty comments.
Malena, while more ambiguously and less obviously inflammatory than 
Loren, is conscious of the stir she causes, keeps a deadpan face, and 
hardly ever speaks.
The teen-age schoolboys under her thrall make me wonder whether 
Tornatore remembered Truffaut's short film "Les Mistons," in which 
the sap rises within mischievous pre-teen boys.  Unconscious of their 
desire for a local beauty, they take out their confusion on her and 
her boyfriend, stalk them, and play silly pranks on the couple.
The kids in the movie already wear long pants--a symbol of manhood-- 
except for the younger Renato who is twelve-and-a-half and barely 
manages to join the fan club.
The youths fantasize about Malena with graphic, coarse 
comments--except, again, for lovestruck Renato who stalks her, even 
makes a peephole in her house, spies on her but never speaks to this 
divine creature. His reveries include parodies of classic movie 
scenes, from romance to gladiatorial,  "starring" himself and Malena. 
Other amusing sections include his pursuit of  long pants and a 
"grown-up" chair at the barbershop; stealing his idol's panties;  his 
mother trying to cure him by exorcism but Dad opting to take Renato 
to a bordello in which the boy selects a Malena look-alike.
The movie portrays the Sicilians as loud and excitable, in a 
post-neorealist way. Then comes a change of modes and moods. The 
comical-sexual satire shifts gears into near-tragedy. Malena's 
husband is reported dead at the front. Widows are acceptable prey. 
The old tabu is lifted for some of the lusting males. To subsist, now 
indigent Malena turns into a reluctant prostitute--and a pariah.
In July 1943 Liberation from the Germans comes as G.Is enter the 
town.  Jealous wives attack Malena for having consorted with the 
enemy. They cut off her hair --a punishment common in many countries, 
and shown in films such as "Hiroshima, Mon Amour." On an isle once 
colonized by Ancient Greece, the women beat Malena viciously, acting 
like Maenads or the vindictive Thracian women of Greek mythology.
Malena goes away, joining hordes of refugees. But later her husband 
reappears, and finally both return to Castelcuto where both Malena 
and her former accusers reach a cautiously redemptive, hesitantly 
open-ended ending.
Tornatore continues his string of first-rate movies. Fame and prizes 
(at Cannes, at the Oscars, etc.) came with "Cinema Paradiso," his 
second film. Before this was a solid first feature "Il Camorrista," 
not distributed in the US in spite of an American actor, Ben Gazzara. 
Before that, Tornatore had made several fine TV films, imaginative, 
cultural documentaries. Post-"Cinema Paradiso" came a string of 
features that were mostly excellent but still suffered from US lack 
(or spottiness) of distribution: the marvelously touching 
"Everybody's Fine," "Especially on Sunday," "A Pure Formality," "The 
Star Maker," "The Legend of 1900."
 From lyrical scenes  to a bombing raid "Malena" is splendidly shot by 
the great, Hungarian-born Lajos Koltai. The loving views of  Sicily 
compete for splendor with Malena's.  All production values are 
superior, from period costumes to Ennio Morricone's music (he is 
Tornatores's constant collaborator). The subtitling is exceptionally 
good and rich.
Shooting was in the southeastern towns of Siracusa (pop. 32,000) and 
Noto (pop. 22,000), then in Morocco, where there was sunshine while 
winter was coming to Sicily.
On the iffy side:  It is confusing that the invented Castelcuto is 
supposedly "a sleepy village" yet looks like a town.
Also confusing is the Professor, Malena's father (or father-in-law, 
it is unclear), who teaches Latin, is constantly the butt of the 
pupils'  loud, vulgar remarks about Malena. But he seems not to 
notice them, yet there's no proof that he is deaf.
An explanation may be that the film's American copies are 94 minutes 
long while in Italy they run 105 minutes.
As in most foreign movies, or for that matter American pictures that 
deal with the past, there's a dimension here that fleshes out matters 
for Italians, though perhaps not some younger ones. The references to 
the popular song "Ma l'Amore No" and to Alida Valli. The fascist 
anthem "Giovinezza." The mocking of Mussolini and his regime. The 
allusions to Italy's rout in North Africa. The post-Liberation former 
Fascists who are cynical, well-dressed and perhaps still in positions 
of privilege. And so on. But cuts and references notwithstanding, 
this is a most satisfying and original work.

MALENA, by writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore (THE LEGEND OF 1900 and 
CINEMA PARADISO), is a coming-of-age story about 12 1/2 year old Renato 
Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), a Sicilian embarrassed to be the last one in 
his class still wearing short pants.
On one eventful day, Renato gets a new bike, Mussolini declares war and 
Renato is invited to join his friends ogling the town's beauty, a 
27-year-old named Malena Scordia (Monica Bellucci).  With her long legs, 
striking physique, jet black hair, skin-tight dresses and generous 
bosom, she literally turns every head in town wherever she walks.  Once 
her husband is killed in the war, every man intensifies his desire to be 
with Malena.
Like a figure in a fairy tale, Malena, who rarely speaks, is more a 
statue or a Playboy centerfold than a flesh-and-blood person.  Renato 
daydreams of their life together.  Sometimes they are actors in movies 
from westerns to gladiator epics.  Shown in sepia tone, some of these 
are so funny it's hard to stop laughing.  Other dreams of his are much 
more sexual in nature, and her vision aids him in bouts of solo sex.  
But, don't worry, this isn't some cheesy AMERICAN PIE version of sex.  
Instead, the movie is filmed with an honest sensuality, and it never 
overplays its hand when it comes to the erotic parts.  (The same can't 
be said of the comedic, which sometimes goes a little too over the top, 
as in Malena's trial for alleged promiscuity.)
The movie dazzles the senses.  Lajos Koltai's cinematography accentuates 
the warm peaches-and-cream color of the stone houses, and Ennio 
Morricone's music is a delightful blend of the sweetly whimsical and the 
dreamily romantic.      
The body of the story has Renato spying on and worshiping Malena from 
afar.  When the town starts to turn against her, he wants badly to be 
her protector.  His age and his inability to summon up the courage to 
speak to her, however, limit his ability to come her rescue.
If you ever desired an older woman (or man) when you were young -- or 
wish that you had -- MALENA will undoubtedly work its spell on you.  
It's a charmer.
MALENA runs 1:32. The film is in Italian with English subtitles.  It is 
rated R for sexuality, nudity, language and some violence and would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.

   This one's addressed to the men...when you were in high
school, did you have fantasies about women who were about
your own age, in your own class for example, or did you
fancy women who were a decade or so older than you? 
We're told that nowadays teens consider anyone more than
ten years older than they are to be over the hill, not worth
considering as real people.  Stereotype this may be: But
another convention is that European men actually prefer
women to be considerably older, or at least they do not
consider age a barrier to a good relationship.  This may have
been particularly true before the sixties, and indeed if you
watch Giuseppe Tornatore's new movie "Malena," which he
adapted for the screen from Luciano Vincenzoni's story, you
get the impression that the young Sicilian guys of the early
1940s in one particular medium-sized town drooled
exclusively over the 27-year-old Malena Scordia (Monica
Bellucci).  Maybe one or two teen-aged women make
appearances in the film, just briefly, but for Tornatore's
purposes there is only desirable female in the entire
municipality.
   Soaking his movie in the obligatory brown hue which is the
way warm climes situated in the past are photographed,
Tornatore uses Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro) as his
spokesman. Renato is a lad lucky enough to own a bike
during a critical time that just about everything was in short
supply.  He joins a gang--which in those days meant not a
group that indulged in pot or coke or crime or basketball, but
whose raison d'etre was dribbling over one particularly
comely individual.  Malena, daughter of the deaf Professor
Bonsignore who is the teacher of the young men, is married
to a man who is at the front and reported dead.  Though
Malena at first appears to be untouchable, gossip quickly
spreads that she has been involved in several affairs--with
the town's lawyer, its dentist, and ultimately the German
officers who take up occupation in the town in 1943.  When
the war ends, the women of the town take near-biblical
revenge on the object of their long-term envy, while young
Renato feels helpless to protect her form the enraged and
mostly homely lynch mob.
   Tornatore's magnum opus was "Cinema Paradiso," about
the love of a young boy for the movie theater in his small
Italian town during the late forties--a warm tribute to the art of
the film.  "Malena" by contrast is an overly simple tale
highlighting a woman who has so few lines that we know little
of her motivations or her very character.  Perhaps her
silence, her seeming obliviousness to the stares she receives
from literally everyone she passes on the cobblestoned
Sicilian streets, gives her the aura of mystery that informs the
boys' wet dreams.  But with Renato's looking consistently
soulful (in fact in downright psychic pain) throughout--unless
he is actually being physically tormented by his cartoonish
parents (Luciano Federico and Matilde Piana), we in the
audience are simply starved for stimuli.  Nor does the film's
derivativeness help.  Take another look at Robert Mulligan's
"Summer of '42," the 1971 movie about a teen with a crush
on a young war bride (played by Jennifer O'Neill) which also
captures the flavor of the 1940s and possesses a delightful
Michel Legrand score.
Rated R.  Running time: 105 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
