Solomon & Gaenor may not be directed squarely at the American Pie crowd,
but nonetheless it revolves around the similar theme of young love (and
young lust).
Solomon sells fabric and women's clothing door to door.  Gaenor is the
prim and very Christian daughter of a mining family in a nearby
village.  Inexplicably, Gaenor is unable to discern from Solomon's mass
of curly black hair and occupation in the textile business that he is
Jewish, and they soon develop a lusty relationship, replete with
hay-rolling booty calls in a local barn.
This, in case you're wondering, is Wales in 1911.
Solomon hides his Jewish heritage from Gaenor, as he would never make
his way into her arms otherwise due to the prejudices of the era.  As
you might expect, the deception leads to all kinds of trouble for the
star-crossed lovers.  Civil unrest and a miners' strike make things all
the worse.
Despite its gloomy promise, Solomon & Gaenor manages to hold your
attention throughout its running time, thanks to strong performances
from its two quirky leads, Ioan Gruffudd (Wilde) and Nia Roberts.  The
love affair is mostly believable, falling somewhere between The Piano
and The Way We Were in degree of heat.  Borrowing heavily from Romeo and
Juliet, the film works with good source material while it puts a unique
spin on things.
It certainly could have gone a lot worse, another morose Feast of July
to send you screaming out of the theater.  But while Solomon & Gaenor is
hardly uplifting, it remains a very good example of the period romance.
In English, Welsh, and Yiddish (with subtitles for the latter two).

If you're familiar with the name Shakespeare, the premise of Solomon and
Gaenor shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  It's got the whole doomed
romance equation (young man + young woman x secret love = tragedy), but
Gaenor is much more than a Romeo and Juliet rip-off.  It was nominated
for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar earlier this year, and it's
probably the first picture to have dialogue in Yiddish, Celtic and
English.
Abandoning Verona for 1911 Wales, Gaenor begins by introducing each of
the victims in the forthcoming romance.  Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, from
the upcoming 102 Dalmatians) is an Orthodox Jew whose family hails from
Russia.  They run a successful pawnshop, where Solomon keeps the books
and hits the town's streets with a pack full of fabric samples to woo
potential customers to the family store.
Along with her mom, Gaenor (Nia Roberts, in her acting debut) is
essentially a servant to her hard-working father and brother.  Both
burly men work at the coal mine, where Gaenor lost her boyfriend in an
explosion.  Like most of the inhabitants of this impoverished town, her
Gentile family spends most of their time either at church or thinking
about the next time they'll get to go to church.
When Gaenor opens the door to Solomon and his fabric, you can
practically see the sparks fly.  Utterly smitten, Solomon makes her a
lovely dress out of one particular material that Gaenor admired during
their first meeting.  When he goes back to present her with the dress,
the film almost captures an audible swoon coming from Gaenor, who
finally succumbs to her secret attraction to Solomon.
The kicker is that Solomon never lets on that he's a Jew.  In fact, he
covers it up, pretending to be an Englishman named Sam Livingstone in
order to pry Gaenor away from her overprotective family.  Gaenor's
parents seem pretty happy with `Sam,' but her big brother becomes
suspicious when he notices that Solomon's hands aren't covered in
calluses
The star-crossed lovers literally roll around in the hay but, like any
guy who's just gotten some, Solomon turns into a jealous, post-coital
jerk.  Gaenor expects him to marry her, but he knows matrimony would be
impossible if she learned the truth about his religion.  And before you
know it, Gaenor is blowing chunks during the morning chores.
If you have the slightest familiarity with storytelling, you know Gaenor
is headed somewhere dark and tragic.  First-time writer/director Paul
Morrisson keeps things even gloomier by setting the film in rainy,
overcast weather.  There's also a devastating scene where the pregnant
Gaenor is booted out of church after she's accused of having pre-marital
sex.  It was almost enough to make me want to start going to church
again.
1:39 Â– R for nudity, strong sexual content, violence, and a pig
slaughter

     The poignant setting is a misty, cold mining town in Wales,
1911.  Not unlike the setting of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF the town has
two nearby communities, one Christian, one Jewish.  In the Jewish
community the Lewinsky family is composed of pawnbrokers and cloth
merchants.  Solomon (played by Ioan) is about twenty years old,
good-looking, and enjoys his work as a "pacman"--going into the
Christian section leaving samples of cloth and taking orders for
larger pieces.  When asked, Solomon denies being Jewish, just to
escape trouble.
     Solomon finds himself particularly attracted to one customer, a
woman about his own age Gaenor (Nia Roberts).  As he continues to
see her, professionally and otherwise, hiding his religion.  He
takes the name Sam Livingstone.  Gaenor is from a family of poor
miners.  Her very large brother Crad (Mark Lewis Jones) immediately
takes a dislike to the stranger who he thinks is less than a man
since he does not have callused hands.  But Solomon and Gaenor are
attracted to each other and are willing to risk the consequences.
     The story is very much the star-crossed lover story, but if
that was all there was to this film it would be mundane indeed.
However, writer and director Paul Morrison does not make this the
film expected.  First and foremost, the two main characters are not
totally blameless in their fates.  There is enough fault in the plot
so just about everybody gets a piece.  It would be very easy to
present the Jewish community as blameless and purely the victims of
intolerance as well-meaning literature has done since IVANHOE.  The
Jews do appear more sinned against than sinning, but they are also
at fault and have their own intolerance.  Gaenor is too fast to
accelerate her relationship with Solomon, whom she hardly knows, and
then refuses to tell him when she needs his help.  Even the
countryside comes in for its share of the fault.  Instead of the
lovely pastoral scenes that usually grace this sort of film,
cinematographer Nina Kellgren's camera accents the unpleasant in the
climate and locale: the stony landscapes, the cold, the gray mist,
the fog, and the snow.  People's lives are as bleak as the
countryside.  Everything in the country seems muted blue and gray.
The only bright color is a dress that Solomon sews for Gaenor, red
the color of sin and rebellion.  Early in the film we see the Welsh
taking turns having kitchen baths, using the same dirty water.  They
sleep two in a narrow bed.  The Jewish and Christian community each
has its restrictions an intolerance of the other.  The Christian
religion appears to be as bleak and unforgiving as the landscape,
the seem a little more positive.  The Jews are given a slight edge
here as we see a meeting where they are discussing the importance of
understanding the writings of Dickens.
     Ioan Gruffudd as Solomon seems a little old to be acting in the
irresponsible way that his character does.  Gruffudd is best known,
to me at least, as a young Horatio Hornblower from a series of TV
movies.  Of the two, Nia Roberts as Gaenor seems the better actor.
She exhibits an odd characteristic of brightening up and being more
attractive when Solomon is around.  As tales of star-crossed lovers
frequently are, this is a story of pain and tragedy.  There is more
pain in one of Morrison's fist fights than in all of the fighting
and shooting and killing in THE MATRIX.  Ilona Sekacz's score
combines Jewish and Celtic themes, an unusual combination.

Oscar nominated as Best Foreign Language Film, the love story
called "Solomon & Gaenor" is set in the Welsh Valleys around
1911. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is a young Orthodox Jewish boy whose
parents run a pawnshop and drapery business. For added income, he
trudges through the gray mist of the muddy, wet valleys selling cotton
fabric door-to-door. That's how he meets gentle Gaenor (Nia Roberts),
whose father and elder brother are miners. They're immediately
attracted to each other but Solomon - painfully aware of the rampant
anti-Semitism of the period and rebelling against his heritage -
conceals his Jewish identity, telling her his name is Sam. After
surprising her with a pretty dress of red calico that he made himself,
they become clandestine lovers. In a deliciously awkward scene, he
meets her family. "Now I want to meet your family," Gaenor pleads. "I
want to make it right."  But Solomon, ashamed, knows his devoutly
religious family will not accept her, nor him if he chooses to stay
with her. Meanwhile, his sister becomes suspicious, Gaenor gets
pregnant and is denounced in chapel, and there's a strike at the coal
mine. The ensuing scandal spells tragedy in director/writer Paul
Morrison's confident, well-directed screenplay. And what etches
"Solomon & Gaenor" indelibly in your mind is the beautiful photography
the evokes the time, the place, and the mood. On the minus side, is
the low-key, uneven way the story unfolds slowly, utilizing a
measured, meandering pace. English subtitles translate the Welsh and
Yiddish. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Solomon & Gaenor" is
a tough, uncompromising 7. It's "Romeo and Juliet" in Wales, capturing
the exquisite pleasure and unbearable pain of first love.

Writer/director Paul Morrisson's SOLOMON AND GAENOR, an Academy Award 
nominee for best foreign film, is a beautiful retelling of the Romeo and 
Juliet story.  Set in Wales in 1911 at a time of strikes and economic 
stagnation, the movie concerns two lovers in their early twenties who 
come from rigid and quite different religious societies.
Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, costar of the upcoming 102 DALMATIANS) belongs 
to an Orthodox Jewish family.  Although he was born in Wales, his family 
is English, and they speak Yiddish at home.  He makes his living as a 
"pacman," which means he sells "cotton," i.e., cloth, door to door.
On one of his rounds, he is instantly smitten by Gaenor (Nia Roberts), a 
member of a Christian community even stricter than Solomon's Jewish one, 
but, like his, their home and school language isn't English -- in their 
case, it's Welsh.  Figuring that she'll never date a Jew, he tells her 
that his name is Sam Livingston, and that, no, he's not related to the 
famous Dr. Livingston.  The clothes in the tiny Welsh hamlet where they 
live are various shades of dull, dark blues and blacks, but he makes a 
cheerful, country-style dress of red cloth for her.  Soon after this, 
they begin secretly seeing each other in the shadows.  Eventually, her 
family invites him to their home for tea and questions, which he fends 
off skillfully.  He refuses her a reciprocal visit to his parents by 
making various excuses.
Gruffudd and Roberts give poignant and endearing performances.  His 
awkwardness with the entire situation is palpable.  Her nervous 
excitement is in evidence in her small, slightly shaking gestures.  Both 
are completely believable as two innocent, young lovers.  And nicely, it 
is the woman, not the man, who leads them to the hayloft for the first 
of their series of trysts.  Their times together, whether they are 
talking, kissing or just holding each other's naked bodies, possess a 
naturalness of which most films only dream.  About the only thing that I 
would like to have seen changed about the film would be for them to have 
spent more time alone together.  Their giddy innocence and genuine love 
is such a contrast to most American films that cheapen relationships and 
sex with trash-talking, wrestling-match sex and sheets to cover bodies 
as if nudity were something to be ashamed of.
Nina Kellgren's incredible cinematography, using dark, somber blues and 
grays with the occasional patches of green, adds considerably to the 
story's intensity.   The bleak Welsh settings of rain and mist are so 
realistically rendered that you'll need a jacket in the theater to ward 
off hypothermia.  Couple these images with Ilona Sekacz's haunting 
score, and the result is a touching and poignant movie that draws your 
heart to it, even if you worry that it may break.
The tragic storyline follows a predictable arc, although the journey 
itself contains several surprises.  But expecting that you know the 
outcome doesn't necessarily diminish the experience.   After all, 
everyone knew exactly what was going to happen in TITANIC, but that 
didn't keep it from being a critical and commercial success.
One thing that is certain is that each of these closed-religious 
conclaves do not want their members dating someone from the distrusted 
other side.  In one of the film's most effective moments, Solomon joins 
Gaenor and her family in quoting the Old Testament verbatim.  The two 
groups act like they worship different Gods, and yet they share such a 
large common text.
The director does a marvelous job of showing the enormous physical and 
emotional hardships that the two lovers endure.  A big fight scene, for 
example, leaves quite realistic scars.  Usually cinematic fights are 
made to look glamorous and macho, but leave little lasting effect.  In 
short, they are usually lies.  But not in SOLOMON AND GAENOR, a movie 
with very much the same tone and approach as Michael Winterbottom's JUDE 
from several years back.
A movie of tremendous sorrow and pathos, SOLOMON AND GAENOR does 
eventually break our hearts, but not without purpose.  We come to love 
Solomon and Gaenor, just as they love each other.  Maybe their happy 
times don't last forever, but does anything?  Regardless of the racial 
prejudice, misunderstanding, and hatred around them, they have each 
other's love, even if it doesn't last as long as they would have wished.   
SOLOMON AND GAENOR runs 1:42.  The film is in English, Welsh and Yiddish 
with English subtitles for the latter two.  It is rated R for sexuality, 
nudity and a scene of violence and would be acceptable for older 
teenagers.
