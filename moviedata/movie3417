     There has been a good deal of discussion about unsung films (many of
which among the film fans I know are at least somewhat "sung").  I want to
recommend a film that I have never heard anyone else recommend.  What makes
it even odder is that it is a religious film and I generally hate religious
films.  This one didn't play fair, however: I already loved the film before
I recognized the story or the allusion of the title!  The film is Franco
Zefferelli's 1973 BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON.  It is one of the most beautiful
films I have ever seen.  Just about any frame of the film, blown up, could
make a beautiful poster for the film.  Music is by popular singer Donovan
and the script bears four names (usually a bad sign), including Zefferelli
and--of all people--Lina Wertmuller.  Some people claim IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE always has the power to cheer them up.  Capra's film doesn't do that
for me but this film does.
