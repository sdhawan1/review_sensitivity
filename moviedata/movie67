ROCK STAR (2001) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston,
Jason Flemying, Timothy Olyphant, Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Jeff Pilson and
Jason Bonham. Written by John Stockwell. Directed by Stephen Herek. Rated R. 
 Rock Star is a heavy metal fairy tale that despite striking some discordant
notes is overall enjoyable and likable. 
 Inspired by the true story of a singer in a tribute band who gets his chance to
join and front a famous rock group, Rock Star features Mark Wahlberg as Chris
Cole, lead singer for Blood Pollution, a Steel Dragon tribute band. Chris
idolizes Steel Dragon's lead singer, Bobby Beers, and knows everything about the
band, its history and members. For Chris, fronting Steel Dragon would be a dream
come true. 
 After being thrown out of Blood Pollution, Chris receives a phone call that
will fulfill his fantasy. Next thing he knows he and his girlfriend, Emily
(Jennifer Aniston), have been jetted to L.A. After a brief audition, Chris is
rechristened Izzy and is soon becoming the idol of millions. 
 Set in the mid-1980s, this rags-to-riches story has much to offer. Even if you
don't like heavy metal music, you will find Rock Star an entertaining outing
because while the music does play a major role in the proceedings, the story is
more about Chris's/Izzy's introduction into the perks and pitfalls of stardom.
 Chris begins his new life filled with wide-eyed innocence and enthusiasm. After
all, he is now the embodiment, the cipher of those millions of anonymous youths
who pay to see him perform and imagine themselves in his tight-leather pants. 
 As time passes, though, Chris learns the responsibilities of stardom are more
than just wailing to an enthusiastic audience. The grueling pace of the road,
the groupies, drugs, publicity shoots and all that the role encumbers soon
begins to wear on the young man. 
 Despite growing jaded, Chris/Izzy never loses his passion for the music. It is
only when Kirk (Dominic West), Steel Dragon's lead guitarist and spokesman,
rejects Chris's song ideas that the young singer understands his limited role
within the organization. Kirk explains to him that the band holds a specific
niche in the music world and any deviation would destroy that toehold. 
 John Stockwell's script is surprisingly low on cynicism, which is refreshing
considering all the fodder this particular territory could have afforded. And
while the script does cast a jaundiced eye at the practices and machinations of
the music industry, it is neither preachy nor judgmental. 
 Wahlberg offers a sincere, hard-working performance as Chris/Izzy. His
transformation from obsessive fan to naive innocent to disillusionment is
gradual and painful. Wahlberg does his own vocals, which were electronically
enhanced, but that should not detract from his first-rate effort. 
 Aniston's role is a bit underwritten as the loyal girlfriend watching the
corruption of her man, but unable to stem the tide. 
 A small, but memorable bit of acting is offered by Timothy Spall as Mats, Steel
Dragon's longtime road manager, who counsels Chris on the wild lifestyle of rock
stardom. 
 One of the film's best moments revolves around the confrontation between Bobby
Beers (Jason Flemyng) and his former bandmates, which echo an earlier scene
between Chris and his former group members. 
 Flemyng's short scene is touching and painful as he tells Chris of the
realities and responsibilities of being a member of a top rock group. 
 One of the funnier moments is a parking lot confrontation between two Steel
Dragon tribute bands, which leads to a war of words, costume critique and near
fisticuffs. 
 Helping the enterprise is the casting of members of various heavy metal bands
in pivotal roles. They include Zakk Wylde, lead guitarist for Black Label
Society and Dokken guitarist Jeff Pilson. 
 If Rock Star, ably directed by Stephen Herek (Mr. Holland's Opus, 101
Dalmatians) has a drawback, it is it's anti-climatic ending. 
 Rock Star is a fast and loud fable, filled with colorful characters and
ear-shattering music. It's a somewhat cautionary tale about wishes coming true
and about how those desires may not measure up to expectations.

PLOT:
A young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band Steel Dragon, to
whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings, gets launched into stardom
when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his
place.
CRITIQUE:
I'm a sucker for movies like this. A young man with a humble background and
lofty dreams, works hard, devotes the time, the energy and the patience, and
ultimately hits it big-time. In the case of this film, our boy loves a certain
heavy metal band and as luck would have it (yup, luck always finds its way into
these types of equations, although generally tied very closely to hard work),
they need a new singer. His entry and adaptation to the whole "rock 'n roll"
lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch. Although I will
preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your
appreciation for this film is your own love (or past love) of heavy metal music
and the whole scene around it. Metal was one of my first loves as a teen and
even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore, I still check out
my Motley Crue, Twisted Sister and Anthrax CDs every now and again. That's not
to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music, but the music
and live performances from the band, play a big part in the movie, and I for
one, had a blast watching and listening to it all.
But the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by
Mark Wahlberg. Wow, hand this fella some major props, as he totally becomes this
heavy metal geek/god (incidentally, METAL GOD was the film's original title, and
a much better one if you ask me). He is this movie and I was quite taken by his
character pretty much the whole way through. He came off like a regular guy with
extremely passionate goals and work ethic, who was willing to do anything in
order to fulfill his dreams. Aniston was also surprisingly good as the
girlfriend (and the romance angle between them was sweet), but she didn't pull
me in hard enough during their emotional scenes. I was also impressed by some of
the "real" musicians who played in the film (Zakk Wylde from Ozzy Osbourne, Jeff
Pilson from Dokken, Stephan Jenkins from Third Eye Blind, Blas Elias from
Slaughter), but actor Dominic West as Kirk Cuddy made the biggest impression
among the band members. It's to note that this film was based on a real-life
tale of a young man who used to sing in a Judas Priest cover band and then went
on to become their actual singer (their original singer also admitted to being
gay, as in this film).
Just for the record, I'm certainly not recommending this film for its
originality or surprise elements, since most of this stuff has already been
covered in some way or another in other movies, but because it's a fun,
uplifting, well-paced movie with a solid central showing by Wahlberg and
energetic live performances. Oh yeah, and for those who dig the "heavier" side
of music, the soundtrack also rocks!! You see...dreams can come true...

Directed by Stephen Herek. Screenplay by John Stockwell. Starring Mark
Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Spall. Running time: 106 minutes.
Rated AA for nude scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 24th, 2001.
Synopsis: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a tribute band which 
covers his heavy metal idols, Steel Dragon. But Chris is so obsessed with 
getting the imitation precisely right that he finds himself drummed out of 
the group. As it happens, this coincides with Steel Dragon's ousting of 
their lead singer, and soon Chris -- together with girlfriend/manager 
Emily (Aniston) -- finds himself summoned to audition for the gig of his 
dreams.
Review: "Rock Star" probably could have been a much better movie had it 
been either much more humourous or much more serious. As it stands, it's 
an uncomfortable hodgepodge of melodrama and comedy, stuck in a hopelessly 
formulaic script by Stockwell, uninspiringly directed by Herek. "Rock 
Star" is like "Almost Famous" without a soul; there are no true characters 
here to explore, no situations of genuine pathos or wit. Instead, we are 
subjected to yet another brainless average-joe-makes-good plotline; there 
are a few decent laughs -- a fight between two competing tribute bands is 
a definite sight to see -- but more which fall flat. Stockwell's script is 
marred by moments of truly bad judgment; a post-concert orgy is apparently 
intended to demonstrate the seedy side of fame, but simply feels 
gratuitous. Some of the performances are worthy of praise; Spall in 
particular is good as jaded Steel Dragon road manager Mats. And Wahlberg 
brings a lot of enthusiasm to Chris, despite his lack of depth. But 
Aniston is just dull as Emily, and the rest of the supporting cast is 
singularly unmemorable. (Actually, I lie: Matthew Glave has two great 
early scenes as Chris' brother, but sadly is thereafter forgotten.) So 
trifling is the synergy between characters and audience that by the time 
we get to the pat, syrupy ending, it's frankly hard to care much anymore.

In his short career, Mark Wahlberg has been most effective when playing
characters full of naďve sincerity.  In Boogie Nights, The Yards, and
even Three Kings, his talent is in making the audience believe he's a
good guy with a lot of heart, just trying his best.  That honest
hopefulness works well for him in Rock Star, a generally entertaining
tale of an 80s heavy metal superfan who suddenly becomes his favorite
band's lead singer.  The problem with the film lies in director Stephen
Herek's inability to take advantage of the strengths that Wahlberg
displays.
The story is loosely based on metal icons Judas Priest, who, in 1997,
replaced singer Rob Halford with an actual fan (so tell me, how would
one actually know if Judas Priest replaced a band member?)  Wahlberg, as
Steel Dragon fan Chris Coles, is just brimming with dedication -- he
works hard as a copy machine repairman, busts his ass in his Steel
Dragon cover band, tells his parents he loves them, and has a long
relationship with his girlfriend/best friend/manager (Jennifer Aniston,
still underrated by Hollywood).  After being booted from his band for
taking things too seriously, Chris gets a call from the real Steel
Dragon, who are interested in his pipes.  Just like that, he's the new
guy out front.
Herek (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Mr. Holland's Opus),
directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director John Stockwell,
does rely on Wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with
Chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie
later, when the film could really use it.  The story, as expected, heads
toward VH-1-land, exposing the excesses of the mid 80s, rock-and-roll
lifestyle, including a drug-laden orgy after Chris's first giant gig
with the band.  From that point on, Rock Star unfortunately takes itself
a little too seriously, taking time to document stuff we've already read
about (it is a full 15 years later, after all, and hair bands like
Motley Crue have been telling these stories for a while).
Rock Star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time,
ripping into the music, the people, and the period, and allowing
Wahlberg's wide-eyed, once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the
movie's emotional honesty and sympathy.  Aniston could have certainly
contributed to that; I can't imagine too many people staring into those
expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman.
Another weakness lies in our inability to really connect with Chris's
initial invitation to join the band.  He auditions, he's in, and we're
off and running.  Where's the scene where he and Aniston are simply
flabbergasted by the opportunity, and privately share that elation? 
That would go a long way in getting us deeper into the characters, but
it doesn't happen.
Herek does direct the concert scenes with a certain urgency and is able
to capture that arena rock experience, as cool or ridiculous as you
might think it is.  But as Chris finds his way in the final act, the
movie breaks down a bit, more interested in having us feel good than
actually being sincere to the story.  They should've asked Mark Wahlberg
about sincerity -- he knows how it should work.

Chris Cole has a dream.  The lead singer of a tribute band, he wants to recreate
the music, the look and clothes of his idol, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng) of
STEEL DRAGON, as accurately as possible.  In his ultimate fantasy, of course,
the band he mimics would actually hire him to be their lead singer.
Welcome to Hollywood, where anything can happen.  One day, STEEL DRAGON fires
Bobby, who is notorious for his bad attitude.  For his replacement they choose
the completely unknown Chris, who adopts a British accent and a stage name of
Izzy.
The problem with ROCK STAR, directed by Stephen Herek (101 DALMATIANS and THE
MIGHTY DUCKS), can be summed up in two words, Mark Wahlberg.  As Izzy, the
entire movie rests on Wahlberg's shoulders, and he can't carry it.  Last seen as
the star of  the remake of PLANET OF THE APES, he has an incredibly limited
emotional range.  Jennifer Aniston as Emily, his girlfriend and first manager,
isn't much more effective.
The script by TV writer John Stockwell starts and ends well enough but contains
a vast wasteland in-between.  Director Herek's experience directing a bunch of
pooches running around or kids skating around doesn't help him fashion a
meaningful or exciting film about the world of heavy metal rock legends.  The
musical concerts are all done by the numbers.  One scene, any scene, from ALMOST
FAMOUS has more life than all of ROCK STAR.
"I'm just a regular guy who grew up with the posters of these guys on my wall,"
Izzy likes to remind his cheering crowds.  "Now, I'm one of them."  I wish ROCK
STAR had given us reason to care.  Although it is so bland that it's sometimes
hard to tell, the movie wants to be a cautionary tale about the cumulative
effect of nightly bouts of promiscuous sex with groupies and lots of drugs.  The
sex, however, is only discussed, and the drugs themselves are mainly AWOL, thus
muting any message.  Instead we get suggestive dances, and people who wake up in
the wrong bed after an unseen night of bad behavior.  
"You know, he's a rock star now," the wife of one of the band members tells
Emily about Izzy.  "Normal rules don't apply."  Guess, what?  He starts out
innocent but quickly becomes corrupted.  Any guesses as to what happens to him
next?
ROCK STAR runs 1:47.  It is rated R for "language, sexuality and some drug
content," and would be acceptable for most teenagers.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, liked the music but thought the movie itself was just
okay.  He gave it ** 1/2.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, September 7, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

The first is about Mark Wahlberg, a punk kid convicting of assaulting a
man and costing him an eye. Instead of becoming a career criminal,
Wahlberg redeems himself, going on to fame and fortune as the leader of
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. When the group's sales begin to fade, he
finds a new line of work and even more attention as an underwear model
for Calvin Klein. Like so many other pop singers and models, Wahlberg
then decides to pursue a career in acting and, against all odds, he
becomes a full-fledged movie star. From street thug to matinee idol 
what are the odds?
The second fairy tale is about Tim "Ripper" Owens, an office supply
salesman from Ohio. In his spare time, Tim sang his heart out as lead
vocalist in a Judas Priest tribute band, hitting the stage nightly to
cover songs by his all-time favorite group. One day, he gets a phone
call from his heroes. Rob Halford, frontman for Judas Priest, has left
the group and the rest of the band, having watched a video of Owens
performing, want him to take Halford's place. From office supply
salesman to rock star  who would ever have thought?
"Rock Star" brings the two real-life fairy tales together, with Wahlberg
playing a character loosely based on Owens. The movie is nothing
special; once Chris Coles' (Wahlberg) fantasy turns real and he is
invited to join the British heavy metal band, Steel Dragon, the story
falls into a pattern that is oh-so-familiar to anyone who has watched
VH1's "Behind the Music."
Still, the early part of the film is a hoot and Wahlberg is delightful.
In fact, for the first time in his acting career, he carries the movie,
passionately defending his beloved band to others, nearly coming to
blows with a singer in another band over the authenticity of a jacket,
and unsuccessfully trying to contain his puppy dog grin during his first
photo session with Steel Dragon.
Alas, Jennifer Aniston does not fare so well. As Emily, Chris'
girlfriend and manager, she is supposed to be more level-headed than her
beau, but at times she comes off overly parental, more like a kindly
schoolmarm than a lover or business person. Aniston has an undeniable
talent, but it is not tapped in this film.
"Rock Star" might have seemed brighter had it not been released in the
long shadow of "Almost Famous," which covers many of the same themes
with far more skill. As is, the film is a minor pleasure, with a strong
first half, a tepid second half and a hell of a performance from Mark
Wahlberg.

   In the 1960's the slogan of the period was "Do your own thing,"
a maxim that in part may be responsible for the downfall in
influence of authority figures in today's society, film critics
included (for this last notion, read Raymond Haberski Jr.'s new
book "It's Only a Movie!")  Paradoxically, Chris "Izzy" Cole (Mark
Wahlberg) wants to do his own thing--which does not include
spending his life as a repairman for copy machines--but in
pushing his fantasy to be a rock musician by forming his own
band, he merely copies the gestures and songs of the band he
idolizes, Steel Dragon, rather than write his own songs and
formulate his own style.  "Rock Star," which is directed by
Stephen Herek  from a screenplay by John Stockwell, deals with
Coles's rise and fall and the ultimate finding of himself as neither
the lead singer of a prominent rock band or fixer of sick copy
machines.  But in its execution, Herek falls back on the cliches of
the genre, emphasizing a loud sound track which simply goes on
too long rather than spending some extra time developing his
characters.  What's more Mark Wahlberg does not have the
range called for in the role of a tragic hero.  Though cast in epic
roles such as this one and that of a time traveler in "Planet of the
Apes," he seems better suited to play smaller roles in indies like
his brother Donnie, who--as an example of more appropriate
casting--outshines Mark in Dan Cohen's sweetheart of a film
"Diamond Men."
   Though "Rock Star" has some appeal as a narrative about
musicians, it embraces a major theme as well, one which
touches on all of us. We all have fantasies of getting out of our
ruts, of standing out from the pack and gaining the adulation of
the multitude.  "Rock Star" has bad news for us, informing us that
fame and money may be cool but that we are not going to feel
happy or realized if we lose our soul in acquiring them.  This
point is punctuated by the fact that the story, though fictionalized,
is based on the experience of an Ohio office supply salesman
named Tim Owens, who once was called on to replace the head
singer in the band Judas Priest.  Actual rock musicians perform
in the nicely choreographed scenes which take place in front of
hordes of adulating crowds--fans of the music will recognize
Brian Vander Ark, Jeff Pilson, Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde
who form the ensemble of a group known as Steel Band, the very
group to which Chris Cole pays tribute in the band that he leads. 
When the lead singer of Steel Band, Bobby Beers (Jason
Flemyng), is bounced by that group's leader, Chris is flown to
L.A. to audition for Bobby's place, though it's clear that Steel
Dragon's manager (Timothy Spall) is not pleased that Chris
invited along his girl friend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).  We soon
see why, as Chris, who is hired minutes after strutting his stuff, is
inundated by groupies--attractive women who want nothing more
than to sleep with these alpha males who are adored by the
multitude.  Though Chris is at first ecstatic over his newly-found
celebrity status--supported by his loving parents and even by his
hostile brother--he comes to realize that he has sold his soul and
that he'd gladly trade it all in to be with the one woman of his
dreams, Emily.
   "Rock Star," then is enlightening as a parable and has
considerable entertainment value as we watch Mark Wahlberg
perform, particularly the song "Stand Up," which appears to be
the signature strain of the group for reasons that become obvious
as we watch the excitement of the crowd soar.  Wahlberg's
chemistry with the syrupy Jennifer Aniston is convincing enough.
She's the girl-back-home type that anyone with a heart would
choose over the bimbos who pack the auditoriums, follow the
cars, and live vicariously through the fame of their shallow
heroes.  The film itself tells us what we should already know--that
not only is fame fleeting, but those who gain celebrity status are
not necessarily fulfilled, considering what they have to give up of
their own humanity.  As such, there is nothing particularly
innovative about "Rock Star," which has the misfortune of
following on the heels of last year's smashing film, "Almost
Famous."
Rated R.  Running time: 108 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
