***1/2 (out of 4) THE LEGEND OF 1900 is an unconventional, imaginative
fable about a man whose entire universe is a ship. 
The story is told by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a sad and lonely guy
who's giving up his career as a musician. He tells the story as he sells
his trumpet to the man at the music shop.
The story begins after the passengers disembark in New York, on the
first day of the first month of the new century -- 1900, that is -- a
ship worker (Bill Nunn) finds a baby on the piano in the ship's lounge.
He names the boy 1900 (for short) and raises him in the boiler room of
the ship.
One day the boy is found playing the piano. He has a natural talent for
it, and so moves out of the boilers to the upper decks of the ship,
where he entertains the passengers.
The talent of 1900 (now played by Tim Roth) is enormous. He can play any
style of music, even from just a hummed scrap of a tune. One of his
favorite styles is jazz, and he earns a sterling reputation as a jazz
pianist. Some say he's even better than Jelly Roll Morton.
Jelly Roll (played with fierce pride by Clarence Williams) takes this
challenge seriously. Since 1900 refuses to set foot on land, Jelly Roll
books a trip across the Atlantic, just to meet this man -- and to put
him in his place. In one of the most memorable scenes, Jelly Roll and
1900 have a musical duel.
In another episode, 1900 comes as close as he ever will to falling in
love. As he plays a ballad for a new recording, he notices a girl on the
other side of the porthole. The song becomes his love for her.
Two of the best things about THE LEGEND OF 1900 are clear in these
scenes. The first is that, because the story is told AS A STORY, the
movie is allowed to take on an imaginative, slightly-exaggerated,
storybook feel. The exaggeration stops well short of zaniness. There is
merely enough to give the characters a larger-than-life charm. (That's
something Tornatore did well in CINEMA PARADISO, too)
The second is that Tornatore acknowledges that music is important to the
movie, and lets it play for a long time. This is worth mentioning
because a lot of directors don't show music scenes for very long 
they're hard to film in a way that's not boring. (Recall Jane Horrocks'
"evening" of music in LITTLE VOICE. It was compressed down to about 5
minutes of screen time, even though it was the film's whole RAISON
D'ETRE. A more recent example is the penultimate scene in MUSIC OF THE
HEART, where no composition gets more than about 30 seconds of screen
time.)
Ennio Morricone wrote most of the music for this movie, and he was the
perfect choice. Morricone's music often seems weird and unconventional
-- as though he had no formal training in how music is "supposed" to be.
(Think of the screamed and quacked voices in the theme from THE GOOD,
THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.) 1900's music isn't THAT far-out, but Morricone's
unconventional-yet-functional style is perfect for the character of
1900, who is self-taught and musically isolated.
The acting by Roth and Vince is impeccable. Although Roth's part was
smaller than it at first seems, he captured the shy, fragile charm of
1900. He wasn't listed in the music credits at the end, but he knew
enough piano to look like he was really doing it. And even though Vince
has acted in a dozen movies, he's never had a part this big. Vince has
darting eyes, which might seem a hindrance, but they add to the pathos
and sympathy of his character. 
One final trait of THE LEGEND OF 1900 is worth mentioning: the
cinematography by Lajos Koltai. A few scenes in particular are
noteworthy. One is the fluid, energetic photography of the great piano
duel. As I said, most filmmakers can't shoot music performances without
making them boring. Tornatore was able to make his performances last
longer by letting Koltai shoot some great stuff.
The other great-looking scene was of the first meeting between 1900 and
Max. Max was seasick and 1900 had the perfect cure. I won't say more,
except that the cinematography in this scene won me over completely.
Roger Ebert gave THE LEGEND OF 1900 a so-so review because he didn't
completely understand the character of 1900. I can't say I understood
him any better, but that's not what this movie was saying to me.

A grand piano accompanied by its carefree pianist (Tim Roth) glide like a
Ouija oracle across a glorious marble-like dance floor aboard the teetering
cruise ship Virginia. It's 1926, the savant at the keyboard is an orphan
raised by the crew whose music rages on in stormy waves; he has never set
foot on dry land.
The tale is a marvelous one, like a muted trumpet's melody it plays.
Conducted would be a better word than directed, the film is accented sharply
with visual and audio hits that strike at the right times. Tim Roth an
under-appreciated actor of excellence, will tickle your ivories with muse
and tug at your grand heart strings with sympathy -- portraying a pure soul
uncomplicated by cities, governments, or even an official name.
A coal throwing scene takes full advantage of the surround sound
capabilities today's theaters now offer. If you aren't drawn into the dark
belly of this boat by the sound of tossed charcoal, look around for a better
movie house. I would have liked to have heard this little-big film expand
its use of the multi-channeled system during musical performances as well.
Nearly a masterpiece, this happily embellished tour takes an odd turn just
before reaching shore, leaving me to disembark disoriented. I'd have written
an entirely different ending. Still, it is to be remembered that this is a
legend, a myth, a tale docked at the edge of the surreal.

 "The world on land -- it's just too big for me."
Starring Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill Nunn, Clarence Williams
III. Rated R.
The Legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie, a rambling,
nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast. It stars
thespian extraordinaire Tim Roth, looking wistful as ever, as a guy
named... 1900. You heard right. His name is, in all actuality, 1900. He
was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 (uh, hence the name), abandoned
and adopted by Danny, a ship crewman. 1900 spends most of his early
years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of Danny's fear that he
might be taken away from him because of "visa matters."
Well, when 1900 is about 9 or so, he starts wondering all around the
ship. One day, he discovers a grand piano. He sits down and starts
playing. Miraculously, what comes out is beautiful. A group of
onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing
music at such a young age. When one of the people who knows 1900 tells
him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "totally
against regulations" 1900 replies "F*ck the regulations!" Ho ho ho.
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land. When he's about 30ish and
can play the piano like nobody's business, onboard comes another
musician. His name is Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and he plays the
trumpet. After 1900 catches Max barfing everywhere during a storm, he
sits him down on the piano next to him, takes the piano's braces off
and plays while the piano flies all around the hall, taking them with
it. How the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate, I
don't know, but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed
to ask.
After that, 1900 and Max become friends. Max is determined to get 1900
off the ship and discover what he is missing on land, but 1900 has no
intention of doing so. What's more, he doesn't even want his music to
go anywhere without him: when a record company hears about his talents,
they come on board to make a record of his music, but after finding out
that -- gasp! -- they're going to make millions of copies, he breaks
the record.
The conflict of the movie is that after Max, unsuccessful in his
endeavor to get 1900 off the ship, gets off himself, he stumbles upon a
record of 1900's music in a store. The record shouldn't exist because
a) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b) the one record that was made
on the ship was broken. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a mystery!
The story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its
elements. We're supposed to be roused by a climactic... piano duel?
There isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel. 1900
comes off as a whiny, brooding, extremely unlikable man: I can't recall
a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo-
meditation on life. Ditto for Max, who doesn't seem to have a life
outside his friendship with 1900.
Tim Roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf; there's
no spirit, no gusto to the character. He insists that he leads a happy
life on the ship, but to us he is dead. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a little
more palatable, at least providing a moment of comic relief here and
there to liven things up a bit. The highlight of the movie would have
to be the eminently amusing Clarence Williams the III as the arrogant,
leering "King of Jazz" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano
duel.
The Legend of 1900 was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, whose 1988 Cinema
Paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many. This effort is utterly
limp and lifeless. At once ridiculous, boring, narrow-sighted and
pointless, this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly
forgotten.

[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Athan Bezaitis.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/f9c71c066258f8b78825682d0020b51e?OpenDocument
Director Giuseppe Tornatore has a knack for weaving a magical story.
CINEMA PARADISO firmly established him as a tour de force filmmaker with
its Academy Award successes in 1988.  His latest feature, THE LEGEND OF
1900, is another intriguing tale, which blends a compelling fictional
character with an exhilarating epoch of American history.
THE LEGEND OF 1900 is the story of a boy's journey to manhood, never
having stepped foot on dry land.  Abandoned on an ocean liner and named
for the year in which he was born, 1900 (Tim Roth- HOODLUM, RESERVOIR
DOGS) grows up within the confines of the trans-Atlantic steamer
Virginia.  His prodigious talent for piano is discovered at a young age
and 1900 spends his days entertaining passengers from all over the world
one boatload after another.  As he gets older his reputation
proliferates to the point that 1900 would be a rich man if he were ever
willing to part with his life aboard the ship.   However, despite
prodding from his friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince- DR. DOLITTLE, THE END
OF VIOLENCE) and others, he is content to remain a fixture at sea.
What will come of 1900 as the war approaches and the waves of immigrants
recede?  Will he move on, or stay forever in the confines of his ship?
The best part of the film is its incredible score.  Composed by Ennio
Morricone (THE UNTOUCHABLES, BULWORTH), the music is a wonderful blend
of jazz and ragtime that captures the sounds and feel of 1900's
mysterious talents.  Roth's jagged facial features are perfect because
we get a lot of close-ups of him at the piano in deep thought sweating
or crying.   Roth effectively captures the complexities 1900's strange
satisfaction with his unique interpretation of the world as a sea
dweller.
 Also worthy of note are costume designer Maurizio Millenotti and
Director of Photography Lajos Koltai.  The look and feel of the film
takes fashion from the height of the roaring twenties and combines it
with a soft blend of lighting and tone, which stylishly establishes the
film's somber mood.
Despite the plot's intrigue, some of the elements of 1900's life that
the film left untouched take away from its effectiveness.   The plot
needed more insight into 1900's character and less time on drawn out
musical sequences with elaborate pan shots.  Two hours left me with
several unanswered questions: Why do we only get a glimpse at his human
frailties towards the opposite sex?  And how does he develop the strong
British accent when a foul-mouthed and rugged ship worker raised him for
eight years?  The film could have complete with more insight into its
characters.
While LEGEND OF 1900 is far from perfect, it is extremely entertaining
and worth seeing, if just for the duel of pianists between Jelly Roll
Morton (Clarence Williams III- THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER), the supposed
`inventor of jazz,' and 1900.  The three round duel sizzles between the
two incredibly talented musicians and is a lot more decisive than a
Lewis-Holyfield bout.

"You're alright as long as you've got a good story and someone to
tell it to."
Starring Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill Nunn, Mélanie Thierry;
Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore;
Written by Tornatore & Alessandro Baricco, from a novel by Baricco;
Cinematography by Lajos Koltai
The 1900 of the title refers, of course, to the year, but also to a
man: Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900.  His strange name can be explained.
He was found as an infant on board a cruise ship called The Virginian by a
man named Danny Boodmann; he was in a "T.D. Lemon" box at the time; and the
year 1900 had just begun.  He was named and raised by Boodmann in the
boiler room of The Virginian, never setting foot on land as the vessel
cruised from Europe to America, back and forth and back again.  He grows up
to become a piano prodigy, and is played by Tim Roth as a mild-mannered,
pleasant, charmingly eccentric man, who seems slightly removed from the
world.  He approaches life at a different angle.
As is obvious, verisimilitude is not the intention here.  The movie
is based on a novel by Alessandro Baricco, best known to English-speaking
readers for his novel "Silk," which treated its characters in a similar
manner, as people whose lives are shaped by stories larger than they are.
Both THE LEGEND OF 1900 and "Silk" show the influence of the Latin American
magic realist novelists, who spin equally grand and improbable tales,
featuring equally colourful, larger-than-life characters.  They give us
tales which hover on the boundaries of the possible and return a sense of
the marvellous to a world dearly in need of it.
We learn about 1900 in a series of flashbacks.  The frame narrative
features Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince in a slightly twitchy, overwrought
performance), a trumpeter who played with 1900 for years and was his
closest friend.  During the course of the film, Max tells parts of 1900's
story to several people, relating his life aboard The Virginian.  Max's
reminiscences are sparked by the discovery of a rare recording of 1900's
music and fuelled by the knowledge that The Virginian, now a derelict, is
about to be destroyed by the port authorities and committed to the ocean
floor.
While the movie is first and foremost a story, a tall tale, a
legend, it lacks the steady narrative momentum which it needs to contain
and direct its ambitions.  Using Max as the focus seems an awkward and
transparent method of preventing the film from unravelling, of holding it
together during its shambling progress from one set-piece to the next.
The set-pieces, though, are wonderful.  The best of all is a "piano
duel" between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), who comes
on board calling himself the "creator of jazz," determined to demonstrate
his superiority to the upstart prodigy.  They square off in the ship's
crowded ballroom, before an expectant audience composed of crew,
passengers, and eager journalists.  The two pianists take turns playing
their tunes.  Director Giuseppe Tornatore (CINEMA PARADISO) handles it
magnificently, delighting us with Jelly Roll's provocative braggadocio,
disarming us with 1900's initial refusal to indulge in the game of
oneupmanship, rousing us as we sense that a final dramatic flourish is
coming.  The "duel" ends with an inspired gesture which is a superb piece
of grandstanding showmanship on the part of both 1900 and Tornatore.
The entire sequence is so good that the audience at the World Film
Festival screening I attended burst into spontaneous applause, as if we had
just witnessed a virtuoso jazz solo, and, indeed, the movie is perhaps best
appreciated in the way one appreciates a jazz show.  The story of 1900 and
Max is the theme to which the players return, while the set-pieces are
solos by great performers, taking the basic materials and reinventing them,
occasionally fashioning something awesome out of them.  The ensemble may
not be jumping the whole night, but the show provides some dynamic and
captivating moments.
The first meeting between Max and 1900 is one such moment.  It
takes place during a stormy night on the ocean, with the ship lurching
violently from side to side, and we are treated to the sight of the two men
seated at a grand piano as it zig-zags wildly across the huge floor of the
dark, empty ballroom.  The mood of camaraderie and whimsy is magical.  The
friends' last meeting is another great scene.  It takes place, again, on
The Virginian, after the Second World War.  The ship is a rusted decaying
hulk.  Max and 1900 sit in the heart of the vessel's ruined splendour, in
the remnants of 1900's whole world, and movingly tell each other about the
course of their lives.
Despite all these moments, THE LEGEND OF 1900 is a story which
loses track of itself.  It forgets what it wants to say.  The fact that
1900 is born at the dawn of the century is surely significant; his enclosed
world of music and eternal movement perhaps serves as a counterpoint to the
industrialization-run-amok nightmares of the twentieth century as it grinds
to a halt.  Or perhaps 1900 is a kind of antihero, and his refusal to
confront the world is intended as an injunction to us: you cannot taste the
fullness of life if you are unwilling to risk its poisons.  The movie can't
seem to decide what 1900 is.  Like 1900 himself, it sails from shore to
shore, from meaning to meaning, without ever settling down.  But the voyage
sure isn't dull.

Earlier this year, Brendan Fraser starred in Blast from the Past, a
comical fish-out-of-water story about a man that was forced to grow up
in a bomb shelter because of his father's knee-jerk reaction to the
Cuban Missile Crisis.  While the film was a bit slight, it was still
enjoyable to see the culture shock Fraser's Adam suffered as he tried to
adjust from his docile 1962 to our dreadful 1999.
In The Legend of 1900, we nearly get more of the same.  It's a
fish-won't-get-out-of-water tale of a man that lived his life on a
luxury ocean liner.  Only here, unlike Blast, our protagonist can never
muster enough courage to step foot off the vessel.  And, like Blast, the
film is a bit slight - a legend that offers no real point or moral  but
still entertaining.
Tim Roth (Hoodlum) stars as Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemons Nineteen Hundred
(or `1900' for short, and `19' for friends) - a name nearly as long as
its explanation.  A laborer aboard The Virginian discovers an abandoned
infant among the confetti and noisemakers used to celebrate the birth of
the New Year on the previous evening.  The boy was found in a lemon
crate, the finder's name was Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn, Kiss the Girls)
and the year was 1900.  Boodmann decides to raise 1900 as his own son,
and the gritty bowels of the ship becomes the boy's first home.
Boodmann does not, however, utter the line, `Now that's a real shame
when folks be throwin' away a perfectly good white boy like that.'
As he grows older, 1900 begins to sneak around the boat and witnesses
how the other half lives.  He is amazed by their flowing costumes,
dancing, and, most importantly, elegant music.  As 1900 begins some
late-night dabbling with the ship's piano, we learn that he is a musical
prodigy capable of performing the most intricate pieces.  It's not too
long before the ship's ritzy upper crust is treated to 1900's
spectacular musical stylings.
Despite having never left the ship, 1900's reputation as a jazz virtuoso
eventually makes land and before long the genre's inventor, Jelly Roll
Morton (Clarence Williams III, The General's Daughter), comes aboard The
Virginian to challenge 1900 to a piano duel.  Morton is a contentious
prick, insulting 1900 before launching into a fantastically intricate
jazz number that thrills the ship's passengers.  1900 responds with a
sweaty performance that would make David Helfgott proud, resulting in
one the best moments in cinema that you will see this year.
(Incidentally, if the theater doesn't burst into applause at that point,
run  you're in a room full of zombies).  The incident helps to further
the legend of 1900 on the mainland, while he is content to repeatedly
make the trip from London to New York.
1900 eventually relents to the pressure of record executives and records
one song while still aboard The Virginian.  The tune is improvised and
hauntingly beautiful, but 1900 smashes the master to pieces as he can't
bear to have his music go anywhere without him.  The broken record is
found in a music store years later by one of 1900's best friends, Max
(Pruitt Taylor Vince, Mumford), who narrates the entire film to the
disbelieving elderly owner of a New York music store (Peter Vaughan, An
Ideal Husband).  Max is concerned for 1900 as The Virginian, which did
time during World War II as a hospital ship, is scheduled to be
demolished.  He is unsure whether his old friend was able to overcome
his greatest fear and leave the ship.
The Legend of 1900 is based on Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco's
dramatic monologue and adapted for the screen by Oscar-winning director
Guiseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso)  his first in the English
language.  Ennio Morricone (Bulworth) provides a majestic score and
Hungarian Lajos Koltai's photography is simply exquisite.  1900 has
already swept five awards at Italy's version of the Oscars (Tornatore,
Morricone and Koltai, in addition to the production and costume
design).  And we all remember what happened the last time a popular
Italian fable hit our continent, don't we?
As a side note, I can neither confirm nor deny the fact that Steely
Dan's song `Hey Nineteen' was about Tim Roth's character.  I can also
neither confirm nor deny that the name Steely Dan actually refers to
Danny Boodmann, who worked in the bowels of the ship, which were made of
steel.

With a pensive tranquility, the normally explosive Tim Roth plays
against type as a character known only as 1900.  The unabashedly
sentimental, English-language film THE LEGEND OF 1900 by writer and
director Giuseppe Tornatore (CINEMA PARADISO) is based on a popular
Italian monologue by Alessandro Baricco.
The good-spirited fable begins as a baby born at the turn of the century
on a ship is left in a lemon carton.  The baby is named 1900 by his
adoptive father, Danny (Bill Nunn), a boiler worker who slaves away deep
within the bowels of the luxury liner, The Virginian.  Danny keeps 1900,
who vows never to leave his shipboard home, hidden away lest some
immigration authority cause trouble for them both.
At age 8, 1900 (Cory Buck) displays an innate ability to create
luxurious music on a piano.  The first time he plays, the entire ship is
awakened by the sublime sounds.  The film itself is a wonderful treat
for the ears and the eyes.  The mesmerizing music must be enough for 2
CDs, and the cinematography is warmly romantic, as are the handsome
sets.
Knowing that the film had garnered considerable negative, early buzz in
the press as being sappy, I approached it with no small amount of
trepidation.  Nevertheless, I was swept away by it, which is completely
opposite to the reactions I heard after the press screening that I
attended.  Maybe this film isn't for everyone, but if you are able to
open your heart to its romantic rhythms, you may be as transfixed as I
was.  As I watched it, it kept reminding me of ONCE UPON A TIME IN
AMERICA, an admittedly better movie, in its grandeur, its intimacy, its
period and its sounds.
Most of the story is told decades later in flashbacks by Max (Pruitt
Taylor Vince), a trumpet-playing friend of 1900.  Max discovers the only
copy of an old record of 1900's and also finds out that their old ship
is about to be destroyed with dynamite.  Both of these events trouble
Max, the former because there weren't supposed to be any copies of
1900's music and the latter because Max fears that 1900 might still be
hidden on board.  Max relates 1900's tale to a music store owner (Peter
Vaughan, Q in the Bond movies), who possesses the lone record copy.
The director, as he did in his award winning CINEMA PARADISO, knows how
to stage scenes with a delightfully whimsical touch and a visually
audacious flair.  One memorable incident occurs during a storm at sea.
As the boat rocks furiously and as the guests have already retreated to
the safety of their cabins, 1900 convinces Max to unhook the piano from
its floor anchors.  The piano glides wildly all over the ballroom as
1900 plays luxurious music on it.  Not many directors would attempt
choreography with a grand piano as the sole dancer.
Another one of the movie's wonderful moments occurs when Jelly Roll
Morton, who proudly claims to be "the man who invented jazz," drops by
the ship to challenge 1900 to a musical duel.  Clearly enjoying every
minute of it, a suave-looking Clarence Williams III ("Mod Squad") does a
delicious turn as a jazz legend.  In a movie whose biggest problem is
that its narrative is allowed too often to get lost at sea, the director
makes the right decision here in letting the battle of piano titans go
on much longer than you'd ever expect.  1900's strategy and the way the
contest is decided are both quite surprising.
The story casts a spell on you as the music flows through your soul.
Although it's more a tone poem than a motion picture, it has a seductive
appeal.
"The end, the end, please just show me where it ends," 1900 begs Max.
The movie itself ends predictably but poetically.  And it's the type of
movie that either you'll love or you'll hate.  Count me in the former
category.
THE LEGEND OF 1900 runs 2:03.  It is rated R for brief strong language.
If you don't mind your children hearing the F-word a few times, mainly
as a replacement for "darn," and if your children like sentimental
yarns, then they are old enough to see the film.

     If I could be sure what THE LEGEND OF 19900 is supposeed to be about
-- or have any sympathy for what I suspect it's about -- I might actually
have enjoyed it. There are certainly some appealing technical elements in
Giuseppe Tornatore's "fable" about a strange character named Nineteen
Hundred (Tim Roth). Born on an ocean liner called the Virginian in the
year that becomes his name and abandoned in a lemon crate, Nineteen
Hundred is raised by one of the ship's coal stokers (Bill Nunn). He also
never leaves the ship, becoming a pianist for the Virginian's jazz band
when his prodigious musical talents emerge. A trumpet player named Max
(Pruitt Taylor Vince) befriends Nineteen Hundred, and becomes convinced
that the piano virtuoso could become a musical legend out in the world. 
Yet Nineteen Hundred continues to struggle with the idea of leaving the
ship, even when he becomes infatuated with a beautiful passenger (Melanie
Thierry).
     For a while, the gilded romanticism of THE LEGEND OF 1900 makes it
easy on the eyes and ears. Cinematographer Lajos Koltai burnishes every
frame with a mysterious light, filling the film with a sense of epic
nostalgia. The music is frequently captivating as well, with Ennio
Morricone's haunting themes building interest in the eccentric Nineteen
Hundred. Music also anchors the film's best sequence, in which jazz legend
Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) comes to the Virginian to
challenge Nineteen Hundred to a piano "duel." It's all quite fanciful,
given an undercurrent of consequence by Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance
of thousand-yard stares, flashing back to the friendship that changed
Max's life.
     In retrospect, Vince deserves immense praise for his work, since he
manages to convey the idea that this story has something profound to say.
It's actually quite a preposterous piece of work, as it turns out, and not
because of its protagonist's unique life. Tornatore just doesn't give us
any sense of who Nineteen Hundred is or what he's all about. At times he's
a dreamer who spins elaborate descriptions of places he's never been; at
times he's a hard-nosed competitor who delights in showing up the famous
Jelly Roll and shouting an epithet after him as he leaves the ship. He
isn't so much a character as he is a deliberate enigma -- not becuase he's
complex, but because Tornatore wants to make him an all-purpose archetype.
Tim Roth gamely tries to give Nineteen Hundred a human face, but in this
"fable" he's not really playing a human. He's just a metaphor for
something or other.
     If forced to guess what he's a metaphor for, I'd have to say it ties
in with early themes in the film about immigrants coming to America. 
Nineteen Hundred's fears of leaving the Virginian may represent those who
stayed behind while others dared to leave for the New World -- the idea of
finding his fortune "out there" isn't as compelling as staying where
things are known and comfortable. THE LEGEND OF 1900 might have worked as
a sympathetic, affectionate acknowledgement of those whose fears held them
back. Unfortunately, Tornatore elevates a phobia to sage philosophy,
having Max nod knowingly as Nineteen Hundred gives a lengthy speech about
the dangers of an "infinite" world. There's something vaguely pathetic
about his paean to boundaries; it's even more pathetic if we're expected
to find him somehow noble in his obsessive fear. The theme also appears
far too late in the story, leaving you to wonder about all the preceding
filler that simply confuses the question of what this character is all
about. Eventually, the film implodes under the weight of the importance
placed on Nineteen Hundred's life. It turns out we've been suckered into
caring about the fate of a vague symbol, and maybe a vague symbol for
something foolish and sad.

"The Legend of 1900" begins in a music shop in mid-century, viols and and 
horns hanging down amid the glorious clutter.  Suddenly we are in the boiler 
room of a gargantuan steamship, men working their hardest to fill the maws 
of the furnaces with coal.
What helps Giuseppe Tornatore's "The Legend of 1900" work its magic are 
these striking locations, places we want to be.  It all works together to 
form a wonderful story, we are made to understand - a story no less immense 
than life itself.
What Tornatore did for the cinema in "Cinema Paradiso," he attempts in 
"1900" to do for music.  To make his job more awesome he casts it in the 
mold of a bold time, naming his very protagonist for the new century.  This 
boy, you see, is the son of immigrants who abandoned him in the ship that 
carried them to the New World.  Found by an African-American engineer 
(played by Bill Nunn), the orphan grows up with the crew as his family, 
hiding in the hold to avoid discovery by any social agencies.  Danny Boodman 
T. D. Lemon 1900, the first two monikers after his only father, soon begins 
to explore above-decks.  There's a quite amusing scene in which he's caught 
playing a grand piano in the ship's ballroom, in the dead of night.  
Although his talent is prodigious, he's told what he's doing is against 
regulations.  Here the kid tells what he thinks of regulations, the same 
obscene response he throws at anything or anyone he doesn't like.
It's right about now that we return to the music shop, as Max, played by 
Pruitt Taylor Vince, is the man relating 1900's story to the owner.  Max was 
a close friend of 1900's, a part of the ship's band, though he is now 
apparently giving up his trumpet - in fact selling it to the old Brit who 
runs the shop.  Having drawn out part of the story with an old record - a 
master matrix of 1900 playing one of his spur-of-the-moment masterpieces - 
the owner is enrapt, and the flashbacks continue.
When Max first joins the band, 1900 is 27 years old, and has never set foot 
off the ship.  He's like the symbol of the new baby each New Year's - except 
he resembles the new century - tough and sharp, yet somehow intimidated by 
his own potential.  1900 becomes a figure larger than life, a musician with 
an easy and formidable talent:  the others in the band occasionally ask him 
not to show them up.  The only problem is his naivete.  Since his 
abandonment, he has never touched dry land, and has no real idea of how to 
go about the business of living on it.  When he glimpses a girl who is 
watching him make the recording aboard the ship, 1900 is smitten.  Will 
there be a romance?  Will Max even talk his sheltered friend into taking the 
frightening descent down the gangplank?
The answer to these questions does not come without difficulty.  In fact the 
ending, as much as it functions as an answer, is too slow and overwrought 
with personal philosophy.  Tornatore should have cut a pregnant pause or 
two.  But oh, what comes before it - this is the stuff of a great movie.
We see inventive camera shots, some playful ones showing 1900's hands on the 
keyboard in multiples:  the man plays so fast that we hallucinate extra sets 
of hands.  Reflections of hands and eyes abound, and one shot shows the 
phantasmagoric world of the rich as they dance behind the windows that 
separate them from the souls in second class and steerage. Tornatore shows 
he is a visionary director who knows how to exploit fully the medium in 
which he works.
The language of early-century steamships is something we are familiar with, 
thanks to "Titanic."  In turns claustrophobic and expansive, the "Virginian" 
is a wonderful microcosm, a jumping off point for hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants.  The vessel serves as a character herself, a place where both 
death and life abound.
Of course music plays another important role.  Ennio Morricone  wrote the 
score, including some difficult hybrids of tunes that show off traits of 
ragtime, jazz and atonal modern - best summed up by one character's comment 
(though it's about Max's spirited trumpet), "When you can't tell what it is, 
it's JAZZ!"  What's most remarkable is how the script ties in music and 
narrative.  The motif of storytelling operates on so many levels in this 
film that it's impossible not to pick up the thread of one without following 
the trail of the other.  When Max asks his friend, "What the hell do you 
think about when you're playing?" we begin to understand that 1900 does 
out-of-ship composition:  he dreams of being in distant cities and wallowing 
in the beauty of natural land masses. Music, for him, is a way of telling 
the most personal tale possible, a free-associative fugue.  We feel pity for 
his plight, but 1900's self-pity never lasts long.  Soon he's the same 
superman of the piano.  In a gutsy tour-de-force, 1900 reluctantly engages 
in a duel with the so-called inventor of jazz, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence 
Williams III). The way Morton is portrayed, even his mother would not like 
him.  A combination of a twentieth-century personality cult and symbol of 
the brutality of the world outside the metal womb of the ship, Morton puts a 
permanent fright into 1900.
As the title character, Tim Roth has perfect pitch.  Blending innocence and 
sureness, social awkwardness and friendly support, Roth is able to convince 
us for extended moments that this fable is real.  One bit of his behavior 
goes over-the-top when he falls hard for the girl - we need more hints of 
his intimate pathology to believe what happens.  Otherwise Roth pulls off a 
performance that makes us forget him in the roles of so many smirky tough 
guys.
I loved Pruitt Taylor Vince as Rub Squeers in the Paul Newman vehicle 
"Nobody's Fool."  Here he gets to show off a more realistic talent, a 1920's 
jazz trumpeter who wheedles his way into the band of the "Virginian."  Aside 
from breathing, Vince fakes his instrument playing well, down to the 
contortions and staggers of a hip horn blower.  Call him a long shot for a 
nomination for best actor in a supporting role.  The most touching bit he 
plays is the search for his long-lost best friend.  Some time in the 30's, 
Max left the ship and got back his land legs.  It appears that the 
"Virginian" was used as a hospital ship during the Second World War, during 
which 1900 stayed aboard and played on.  But now the ship is scheduled for 
demolition, and Max is convinced that 1900 has reverted to being a hermit 
within the hold.  Max's emotions during his search are telling and fully 
realized.
Giuseppe Tornatore engages in what might be termed slow-onset magical 
realism.  It takes a while for his artistic strokes to gather momentum, to 
coalesce into recognizable themes and symbols.  But when the jokes and 
motifs kick in, the viewer indeed experiences magic.  These moments make you 
want to whisper to fellow viewers to confirm the astounding power of 
subtlety.  But like the best phrases of music, it's best to keep these 
moments private, to store them among the few handfuls of cinematic essence 
that you carry with you everywhere, to take out once in a while and cherish 
like a toy from childhood.

_The_Legend_of_1900_ is, by every definition, a beautiful film: it's
lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting
is exquisite.  Looks may not count for everything when it comes to
movies, but in the case of Giuseppe Tornatore's old-fashioned cinematic
fable, it is more than enough, creating an enchanting, emotional spell
that is hard to resist.
Contrary to what the title may lead one to believe, _The_Legend_of_1900_
is not about one eventful year, but the many eventful years of a man born
in and named for that year (played as an adult by Tim Roth).  Abandoned
by his birth parents as an infant, Nineteen Hundred is discovered and
raised aboard the steam ship _The_Virginian_.  A natural born pianist,
his uncanny skill with the keys earns him a following among the many
travelers who cross the Atlantic aboard the ship, even attracting the
attention of the father of jazz himself, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence
Williams III).  But Nineteen Hundred never sets foot off of his ship, and
as he sees the world pass him fraction by fraction with each voyage, he
wonders about a life on solid ground.
Tornatore's execution of the already sentimental story is as unabashedly
manipulative as it sounds, and while it's understandable why some critics
have thusly panned the film as being shameless claptrap, the broad
execution fits.  _The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a realistic story, but, as
it is billed, a fable--a tale of larger-than-life characters and
similarly exaggerated emotion.  Ennio Morricone's grandiose score
perfectly complements the atmosphere.  The mechanisms do show a bit too
clearly in the film's finale, which works too hard to get the audience to
cry.  The tear-wringing efforts may not work, but the fact that a
palpable sense of sadness and loss lingers not only over the ending but
the entire film shows how effectively Tornatore created his make-believe
world.
A key factor in giving the fantasy world some grounding in reality are
the actors.  The versatile Roth is enormously sympathetic as the
brilliant but lonely Nineteen Hundred; his tenderness may come as a shock
to those more familar with the scuzzy characters he's known for playing. 
Just as critical to the film's success is the performance of Pruitt
Taylor Vince, who is equally as touching as Max, Nineteen Hundred's
trumpeteer best friend and the film's narrator.
For all the talk of the art behind the medium, film is all about
transporting audiences to another place and time, removing them from
their here-and-now into the world that is presented onscreen. 
_The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a perfect film--one is always acutely aware
of the mechanics behind its manipulation--but for its intents and
purposes, it doesn't have to be.  One leaves the film reflecting on its
beauty and special sense of magic--which is all that counts.
"Beauty" and "magic" are words that wouldn't come close to being used to
describe the directorial debut of _1900_ star Roth, _The_War_Zone_.  The
film is not, as the title suggests, a war film, but emotional brutality
of this grim tale is just as, if not more, disturbing as, say, the
opening 20 minutes of _Saving_Private_Ryan_.  The war zone in question is
the modest four-person household in the countryside of Devon, England. 
The family appears to be nothing out of the ordinary, with the foibles of
a modern unit, particularly one that has moved from the big city (London
in this case) to the remote country.  The father (Ray Winstone) is in the
midst of ironing out business matters; the mother (Tilda Swinton) is due
to give birth to her third child; the 15-year-old son, Tom (Freddie
Cunliffe), misses his friends in London, and passes his spare time with
his elder sister, the also-teenage Jessie (Lara Belmont).
But there's a dark truth bubbling under the surface, one that Tom
stumbles upon one night, setting a course for disaster.  I will not
reveal what that truth is, but needless to say it's wholly
unpleasant--and portrayed in a discomfiting, unflinching manner, for
which Roth must be commended.  He takes a great risk in confronting a
sensitive subject with such brazen matter-of-factness, and the film's
success does not come with the fact that he took the risk, but that he
takes that risk without ever seeming exploitative.  There is no
sugarcoating nor glamorizing of the situation.  He presents it as it
is--raw and painfully real.
As is the case with many directorial projects by actors, the acting is
uniformly solid in _The_War_Zone_; in fact, it's nothing short of
extraordinary.  Standing out among the impressive cast are the two gifted
newcomers, Cunliffe and especially Belmont.  The fact that these two are
unfamiliar faces only heightens the realism, and, in turn, the film's
devastating effect.  A very rough sit, the uncompromising _The_War_Zone_
is by no stretch an enjoyable film, and for that reason, it is one to be
greatly admired.  (_The_War_Zone_ opens December 10)
