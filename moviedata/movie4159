Reviewed September 1998.
"Wild Reeds" directed by Andre Techine, was the best film of 1995, and 
one of, if not my favorite, foreign-language film I have seen.
This beautifully made French film is set in 1962, and revolves around 
four teenagers. At the center of the story is Francois (Gael Morel), a 
rather shy, introverted young man who is staying at a boarding school. 
When a new student, Serge (Stephane Rideau), who is a much more 
rebellious person, comes to stay at the school, they become friends, and 
to Francois' shock, finds Serge in his bed late one night. After this 
encounter, Serge strays farther away from him, and it is apparent that 
he is not interested in a relationship, but he leaves Francois utterly 
confused about his own sexuality. Also a large part of the story is 
Maite (Elodie Bouchez), Francois' long-time female best friend, who 
obviously has deep feeling for him, and the oldest student at the 
boarding school, Henri (Frederic Gorny), who is about to turn 21, and 
has purposefully failed each year because he is afraid to face the "real 
world." 
Something I have noticed lately is that the characters in American films 
almost always act like immature children, and in most foreign films, the 
characters are infinitely more intelligent and interesting people. "Wild 
Reeds" proves this point to a T, even though these characters are still 
in high school. This motion picture is full of such truth and honesty, 
that it is in another league with most films that are made nowadays. 
Regardless of what the film is about, it is not a "gay" film, and the 
film is far too complex for it to be labeled such a thing. Instead, it 
is about the uncertainties and insecurities of growing up, and the 
picture understands and cares about the characters so much that the 
audience can't help but do the same thing. Also, all of the characters 
are written to be fully-developed, living-and breathing human beings, 
and they are helped even more by the amazingly mature performances from 
its cast, particularly Morel and Bouchez, who have a large future in 
films. Incidentally, Bouchez was awarded the Best Actress prize at this 
year's Cannes Film Festival for a yet-to-be-released French film. There 
are moments within the film that involves these characters that are full 
of such unblinking reality and intelligence that there is no way it 
could be a "mainstream" American picture.
Another highlight of "Wild Reeds" is its music, which is filled with 
several 60's hits, such as "Barbara Anne" and "Runaway." Although this 
may, at first, sound a bit strange, since this film is in subtitles, it 
only adds to the realism since in France in the 1960's American pop 
songs were no doubt popular, and they fit perfectly into the story.
The conclusion of "Wild Reeds" is splendid, as it brings together all of 
these characters and story threads, and all of the predicaments are 
dealt with. And yet...very little is solved, except that, I sense, the 
characters have grown quite a bit as people and have learned about 
themselves. In this sense, it is just like real life, because not 
everything is always resolved and wrapped up within two hours. Instead, 
"Wild Reeds" leaves you thinking and pondering about what lies ahead for 
these four people, even after the end credits. Judging from the film 
itself, their lives will not be a bed of roses, but they will make it 
through everything quite alright, I'm sure.

Starring: Elodie Bouchez, Gael Morel, Stephane Rideau, Frederic Gorny, 
          Michele Moretti, Jacques Nolot 
Director: Andre Techine 
Producers: Alain Sarde and Georges Benayoun 
Screenplay: Andre Techine, Gilles Taurand, Olivier Massart 
Cinematography: Jeanne Lapoirie 
Released by Strand Releasing 
In French with English subtitles 
     Winner of four 1994 Cesar awards (best picture, best director, best 
screenplay, and best female newcomer), WILD REEDS beat out such big-name, 
high-budget productions as QUEEN MARGOT.  Originally commissioned by 
French television, but first released theatrically, this story of four 
youths struggling with the pressures of becoming adults in 1962 France 
presents an honest look at all the angst and uncertainty of finding 
oneself. 
     If WILD REEDS was just another coming-of-age story, it wouldn't be 
worth more than a cursory glance.  However, Andre Techine's semi-
autobiographical look back at his final year in boarding school possesses 
more depth and realism than many similar films.  Nostalgia does not tint 
this narrative with its warm sepia tones.  Essentially a character study 
of the four corners of a romantic quadrangle, WILD REEDS examines 
adolescence from the point-of-view of those who feel themselves to be 
"outsiders," and shows that while the political and social climate may 
affect a person's development, other factors--such as friendship and 
love--are often more dominant. 
     WILD REEDS takes place around the time that the Evian Agreements 
ratified the independence of the Algerian people.  The Algerian war, as 
devastating to France as Vietnam was to the United States, has ended, and 
the nation is facing a time of national reflection and identity 
rebuilding.   
     Maite (Elodie Bouchez) is the only girl in the group of four.  
Descended from a Spanish family (her last name is Alvarez), she's the 
daughter of the school's French teacher.  She is also a devout Communist, 
at a time when Communism is in vogue.  Fiercely loyal to her beliefs and 
hopelessly in love with the intellectual Francois (Gael Morel), Maite is 
nevertheless frightened of a sexual relationship.  Not that one is likely 
with Francois in any case, since he's in the process of recognizing and 
coping with his homosexuality.  An experimental relationship with Serge 
(Stephane Rideau) confirms Francois' beliefs, but Serge views their 
coupling as a moment of experimentation best forgotten.  Francois, 
however, is unwilling to give up his newfound friend/lover, but Serge is 
more interested in pursuing Maite. 
     Into this mix comes Henri (Frederic Gorny), a twenty-one year old, 
intellectual French national expelled from Algeria.  Branded a fascist by 
Maite, Henri arrives steeped in bitterness and anger at just about 
everyone and everything.  Gradually, through patience and effort, 
Francois breaks through Henri's facade.  But it is the tempestuous 
relationship that develops between Henri and Maite that leads to one of 
the film's defining moments. 
     WILD REEDS is one of those movies that tells a story about simple 
events in the lives of normal people.  Nothing spectacular happens here.  
The pace is quite deliberate and occasionally a little slow.  Director 
Techine simply will not be hurried.  Little details and character 
interaction make this film worth viewing.  These are the kinds of people 
you get to understand and care about over the course of one-hundred ten 
minutes. 
     Emotions often seem richer and more intense in character-based 
dramas, and that's the case in WILD REEDS.  There's a sense of immediacy 
about every new sensation and feeling.  Credit for this should be divided 
equally among script, direction, and performances--all four of which 
are turned in by relative newcomers.  Elodie Bouchez, winner of the best 
female newcomer Cesar, deserves special mention for bringing an extra 
measure of life to Maite. 
     Ultimately, WILD REEDS works because it remains steadfastly true to 
itself.  This may sound trite, but consider how many movies go for facile 
resolutions to satisfy the so-called "masses."  All the relationships in 
this film, no matter how deeply-felt, are ephemeral, and presented as 
such.  This is a slice of life with an imperfect beginning and 
conclusion, but what transpires between those two endpoints is strong 
enough to leave an impression on anyone with the patience to commit to a 
movie of such unhurried temperament.

A film review by Karl Rackwitz (Germany, 1998)
Copyright 1998 Karl Rackwitz
Directed by André Téchiné;
With Gaël Morel, Elodie Bouchez, Frédéric Gorny, Stéphane Rideau,
Michčle Moretti
German title: "Wilde Herzen"; American Title: "Wild Reeds"
I want to start at the end. The camera seems to have lost its
orientation. It rotates, seeking young people whose search of their
place in life was described in the film. Maybe some spectators are
looking for orientation in their lives too, and possibly the film could
help them.
The scene of André Téchiné's convincing, prize-winning autobiographic
drama "Les roseaux sauvages" is laid in the France of 1962, short before
the end of the Algerian War. France had already consented to Algeria's
independence under an agreement, but this peace treaty was combatted by
the OAS, a nationalist organization of French living in Algeria.
The main characters in the film are four boarders.
François (Gaël Morel) and Maité (Elodie Bouchez), the daughter of the
French mistress Mme. Alvarez (Michčle Moretti), love each other, but on
a purely spiritual level. More and more François perceives a homosexual
inclination in himself. He falls in love for his class-mate Serge
(Stéphane Rideau). But the latter doesn't reciprocate his love. They
sleep with each other only once. Serge is heterosexual and feels
attracted by Maité, but she feels reservations against him.
In a noteworthy scene at a party François confesses Maité that he slept
with a boy, but she explains François that this doesn't alter her love
to him.
At the beginning of the film François, Maité and Mme. Alvarez are guests
at the wedding of Serge's brother, who was a pupil of Mme. Alvarez in
former times and who is now a French soldier in Algeria. Serge's brother
asks Mme. Alvarez, a communist, to hide him, because he doesn't want to
return to Algeria. But she refuses. Later Serge falls a victim to an
assassination committed by the OAS.
Serge angrily leaves the funeral. François induces Maité to follow Serge
in order to console him. François wishes that these two people he loves
shall love each other as well.
Mme. Alvarez has a breakdown caused by a sense of guilt. Serge for the
present looks upon the newcomer Henri (Frédéric Gorny) as an enemy,
because Henri is an Algerian-French adherent of the OAS. Mme. Alvarez
and Maité also feel reservations against Henri, and somehow so does
François. But nevertheless François feels also attracted by Henri in
some way, what entails discussions with Maité ...
One theme of "Les roseaux sauvages" is tolerance. The tolerance motif is
also verbally expressed, when François reads out Jean de La Fontaine's
fable "Le chęne et le roseau" in a French lesson. You can find the
tolerance motif in connection with the liaisons of the protagonists - as
in the above-mentioned confession scene. And you can also find it in
connection with their views of life and their political standpoints (for
instance their attitudes towards the Algerian War), that are different
because of different origin and personal living circumstances. The film
shows impressively, that political disagreements needn't be an
insurmountable barrier on the way of friendship or love, but can be
overcome by mutual respect and interest in the thoughts, feelings and
living circumstances of the other person. That becomes especially clear
in the presentation of the relation between Maité and Henri.
But Téchiné's film is not a pure discourse on tolerance. "Les roseaux
sauvages" deals sensitively and believably with the relations, problems,
yearnings, fears and views of life of its young protagonists in a time
of political and personal transition. It narrates of their search of
political, social, sexual and human orientation.
Téchiné found fascinating images for that. He succeeded in making an
important, extraordinarily multi-layered film that gets along without
sentimentality or big effects. Téchiné's direction is outstanding. And
the young leads impress by very fine performances. Elodie Bouchez in the
role of Maité is especially riveting.
In the above-mentioned final scene the camera finds the teenagers.
They're crossing a bridge. In their search of the right way in this
difficult time they have found a bit orientation.
Excellent films like this one and Jacques Doillon's "Le petit criminel"
(1990), which in a very different context also treats young people's
search of stability and love, got me to pay more attention to French
cinema.
I give Téchiné's film a ****˝ rating on the scale of five stars.

"Les roseaux sauvages" is a masterpiece, a much better movie than
Téchiné's average, rather banal "Rendez-vous" (1985) and his watchable,
but uneven "Le lieu du crime" ("Scene of the Crime", 1986).
Excellent films like "Les roseaux sauvages" and Jacques Doillon's "Le
petit criminel" (1990), which in a very different context also treats
young people's search of stability and love, got me to pay more
attention to French cinema.
