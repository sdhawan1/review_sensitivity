First, let us now praise Peter Weir and Scott Rudin for producing a film 
rated PG, one suitable for my daughter on her tenth birthday.  THE 
TRUMAN SHOW had two profanities I can recall, no sex scenes, no 
gratuitous violence, and a lot of ideas.
All these elements make me like Jim Carrey more than I used to.  
Although my students have talked about them for years, I have never seen 
the Ace Ventura movies.  I'll admit I rented THE MASK, and got quite a 
few laughs out of it.  And a student teacher in my film literature class 
showed LIAR LIAR.  These are solid but minor comedies, thrust into 
prominence by our culture's demand for vulgar slapstick.  (From what 
I've heard about THE CABLE GUY, it's not worth my time even to rent, 
though I do like to claim that, as a teacher of film, I am aware of 
popular trends.)
What causes me to admire THE TRUMAN SHOW even more is that it's not 
being hyped as purely a comedy.
Think back to 48 HOURS.  (I might better use THE CABLE GUY here, but 
haven't seen it!)  Wasn't this Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte flick 
advertised as a comedy?  But didn't its conflict revolve around one of 
the most ruthless killers in any film of that year?  I remember sitting 
in the dark and almost shivering at his heartless violence;  I was 
unable even to chuckle at the one-liners Murphy lobbed during the more 
tense parts of the plot.
Well, THE TRUMAN SHOW is not a comedy, but a heady satire of the 
American consciousness, a send-up of the voyeuristic media addicts that 
we've become.  When the picture opens with a close-up of Truman Burbank 
gazing at himself in the mirror of his medicine cabinet, we are pulled 
in by the wild imagination of his private monologues.  But here's the 
rub:  we also realize that moments like this are prized, quirky products 
of our privacy.  One of the reasons this film succeeds is that we are 
reminded to hate ourselves, however mildly, whenever we see Truman 
photographed through a "button-cam," or through the console of his 
sedan.  (This is done cleverly, by the way, through lenses with edges 
resembling coke bottles.)  The eaves-droppers ogling the oblivious 
Truman as he proceeds innocently with his life  the waitresses, the two 
cops, the guy whose life is lived in his tub  these people are us.  
This is one type of "winking" the film does.
Another type involves the placement of products.  No, these are not real 
products, like the Reese's Pieces used in E.T.  Instead, they are 
fictional kitchen devices and powdered drinks that Truman's sunny-faced 
wife is forever pitching in the direction of one of the hundreds of 
cameras hidden around their house.  These are self-reflexive winks, 
reminding us of the ever-present products that are advertised within the 
very texts of our films (not to mention in the fictions of writers 
striving for verisimilitude). That these endorsements have nothing to do 
with our real lives is stressed in a powerful scene that has Truman 
desperately confronting the actress playing his wife.
"It's a life," says the director of this television institution, in the 
opening moments of the film.  The way in which writer Andrew Niccol and 
director Peter Weir make Truman's life realistic is similar to the way 
writers make their fantasies seem true.  Gabriel Garcia Marquez uses 
minute details in his stories.  This is the secret of magical realism.  
THE TRUMAN SHOW drops in on the title character rummaging through a 
trunk containing boyhood memories.   We see photos of young Truman with 
his father, now supposedly dead.  We see Truman burying his nose in a 
sweater left behind by a girl named Sylvia (whose cast name is Lauren;  
there are endless double and deceitful images at work here).  We witness 
countless traces of Truman's past, even through flashbacks on the 
screens of the world's viewers. In the end, we realize the sanctity that 
should be accorded Truman's life, and perhaps feel assured that no, our 
society really would not stand by, letting a corporation adopt a baby 
and permitting the construction of a set the size of a city, just to 
broadcast every second of his life.
One weakness is the superficial handling of Truman's wife when Truman is 
truly on to something.  Pushed beyond what she deems "professional," the 
actress shrieks "Do something!" and soon disappears from the scene.  
Another actress is conveniently inserted as a possible love interest.  
But wouldn't it have been more realistic to show the small scenes of 
loneliness (or maybe relief) felt by Truman as he roamed the house after 
his "wife's" desertion?
One test I often apply to comedies is, if it gets a belly-laugh out of 
me, the film is a decent comedy.  This test is subjective, of course, 
but it's just as valid as saying that a short story is good if it makes 
you cry, a comment I overheard from a creative writing professor.  
Although I only guffawed during THE TRUMAN SHOW, I relished the frequent 
funny moments and absolutely loved their intelligence.  
>From his sickbed, his voice played over a still shot of himself, Gene 
Siskel said this may be a "watershed" movie for Jim Carrey.  I agree.  
Carrey is no longer just another rubber face.  It's the first film of 
his that I would show as a solid part of a high school film curriculum.  
My daughter is grateful, too, that it is not among the majority of 
talked-about films, the PG-13s and Rs which, for the next couple of 
years, her parents will not permit her to see.

THE TRUMAN SHOW
(PARAMOUNT PICTURES)
RUNNING TIME: 1 HOUR 42 MINUTES
STARRING JIM CARREY AND ED HARRIS
DIRECTED BY PETER WEIR
After a long wait, Jim Carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big
screen. In case you've been asleep for the last few months, the plot centres
on Truman Burbank (Carrey) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the
beautiful town of Seahaven. His life seems so perfect, however, because it's
controlled by Christoff (Harris) creator of The Truman Show, the program
Burbank is unwittingly the hero of. That's right, Burbank's life is being
broadcast live to the American public, and Seahaven and all it's inhabitants
are inclosed in a massive sound stage. The film takes the Jerry Springer
format one step too far...
With an idea so different, it would be easy for the director and
screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator.
Luckily, the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages, yet never
seems to be a dumb Carrey movie. Talking of Carrey, he's perfect in this
movie, enjoying the best role in his career. His character is a re-inforced
Stanley Ipkiss from The Mask (1994) and is completely suited to Carrey's
persona. He occasionally falls into Ace Ventura mode, shrieking and being
silly, but generally the audience is watching subdued Carrey. He's not
completely dramatic like the film promises, however. Ed Harris brings an
extreme intensity to Christoff, the megalomaniac creator of the show. Quiet
and well spoken, he burns an image into the viewer. Unfortunately, he's
barely in the film, and for the first hour dosen't appear at all! Also
disappointing is Natascha McElhone's character Sylvia. She plays the role
well, but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines
just when the audience is used to her. The supporting cast is excellent, and
the town of Seahaven looks delightfully perfect, so perfect it's creepy. The
Philip Glass soundtrack is also superb, and is used to great effect during
the film.
Peter Weir keeps the film going, clearly having fun. The film is far more
upbeat than his  previous films Dead Poets Society and Green Card. Although
it is slightly slow to begin with, about half an hour into film the pace
really picks up, and when Christoff is introduced fully the film is on a
roll. Sadly, though, the film is practically over when the film is in full
steam. Also, concerning the ending, it is slightly too ambiguous, which was
disappointing. The screenwriter, Andrew Niccol, who bought us Gattaca (1997)
delivers an entertaining script, and manages to keep the plot in trim. While
Christoff's plans to keep Truman in do get increasingly silly, they never go
over the line, which would have been easy for Niccol to do. Also, there's
some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the
show.
Overall, The Truman Show is excellent entertainment. Certainly different
from the usual crap Hollywood produces, it should be viewed by everyone. It
offers something to every member of the audience, and you would almost
certainly not come out disappointed.

There's one thing that Peter Weir (the director) does with The Truman Show
that makes it utterly brilliant, and it's something so subtle that you have
to think to notice it. The entire time you're viewing Truman, you're not
watching a movie, you're watching a show. The Truman Show, in fact. From its
opening frame, where Big Brother-esque creator Christof is explaining his
concept of The Truman Show, you are being drawn not into a film but into a
television story. In fact, as it remains strictly within the dome in which
Truman lives for the first half of the film, you are watching him not in the
conventional shot of a box shape, but instead in the shape of a human eye.
In the paranoid world of Truman, you are watching.
The Truman Show, in truth, has no truth. It's a movie about the farce of
small town reality, and when you go there, you get weird. In so many ways
this movie mirrors the darker, more industrial and film noir Best Picture
nominated "Blue Velvet" (1986), the David Lynch film in which a man walks
through a field, begins throwing stones at a small shack, and picks up a
human ear. The bittersweet small town satire in this film is coolly and
calmly apparent.
It's not a fast film. It's not a funny film. What it is is a film about
humanity, about human reactions, and about how strange our realities can be
as we accept them. Triumphant and sorrowful, the movie reminds me of 94's
Forrest Gump, another film where you had a man not quite knowing his world.
The plot is simple: the plot of any negative utopia book or movie. A man,
discovering that THEY are watching, does not like this and tries to escape.
But what is he escaping from? In reality it is paradise. Acted,
melodramatic, but still paradise. And the thing is, he's just like everyone
else in a small town: he wants to get out.
But we have people against him. The Big Brother (George Orwell's "1984") of
the establishment would rather he live in the dome, live and die on public
television. Of course this makes it a film about triumph. But it has a twist
to it: at the end, it makes it so you don't know what you want. Posed to go
out the door, part of you is cheering for him to run, and part of you wants
him to stay, to continue providing hope. He's told to say something. He
thinks. Opens his mouth and

Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Holland Taylor and Ed Harris
The 1998 Summer Movie Season is still in its infancy. But after
diasappointing films such as "Godzilla" and "Fear And Loathing In Las
Vegas", it would be nice to see a really good film. But I doubt you
could have expected this.
The Truman show is one of the most unique films I have ever seen, and
it deserves a spot on the "Decade's Best" list. There is no way to
isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim, "Yes,
THAT'S what makes this film great." The blend of Peter Weir's
masterful (and in many ways brilliant) direction, Peter Biziou's
stunning photography and Jim Carrey's performance is what makes this
film work so fantastically.
There is something strangely beautiful about every shot in The Truman
Show. It may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the
frame, but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect.
Carrey has made a very wise choice. By playing mild-mannered Truman
Burbank, he allows himself enough room to be comical, and therefore
not alienating his true fans, while still showing a vulnerable and
human side. That is a side which has been missing from nearly every
major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes.
Truman Burbank was born to an audience of millions. He was chosen
before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show. Everything
in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians, led by the
show's director, Christof (played by Ed Harris). Everyone in Truman's
life is an actor or an extra. They are all being watched by millions
of people around the globe, people who can tune in at any time of the
day to see what is happening in Truman's life. But he is the only
person that is not aware of it.
The classification of The Truman Show may be tricky. The audience
reacted to many of Truman's revelations with laughter. I did not laugh
much during the film because I was so emotionally wrapped up with the
character. The things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy
eyes, because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to
him his whole life was wrong. So is this going to end up labeled as a
comedy? A drama? It really depends on the audience. But to me, The
Truman Show was a touching, sad tale about the extents to which a
corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of
others.
But above all else, The Truman Show was a stunningly beautiful picture
with humor, heart and scary realism. Oscar predictions in June are
pointless, but if The Truman Show had been released on schedule in
late fall or winter of 1997, as originally planned, James Cameron
would be Oscar-less.

A movie that's been as highly built up as the Truman Show, with reviews
boasting, "The film of the decade!" and "A breakthrough!" can only be
leading up to letdown. That's no doubt -- it seems any movie with
critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your
life, that you'll end up changed on the other side, and you come out of
the theater going, "Eh... *that's* what all the fuss was about?"
So, naturally, The Truman Show was building up to what was going to be a
dissapointment. And I convinced myself, as I nestled into my
uncomfortable movie theater chair, actually to TRY not to enjoy it.
Let me tell you, that is an impossibilty.
The Truman Show is truly "the film of the decade" and "a breakthrough"
and MORE. And you will come out changed on the other side. Such a movie
comes around only once in a lifetime, where you find yourself feeling
everything that the character is feeling, and this, friends, is IT. Jim
Carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain
us; that he can be as dramatic as any of Hollywood's leading men.
The film has a difficult premise to tackle, trying to set us up thirty
years into the "Truman Show's" run, but tackle it it does, and
perfectly. With flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television
show, you get the sense that you are viewing a *real* prime-time hit.
And the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the "real"
Truman Show is clever and well-done.
People, rejoice! This is the FIRST Oscar-worthy film of not only this
year, but of the last five years. Not since "Schindler's List" has a
movie captured human spirit and true despair so well. This is a classic
in the making, and (to borrow a line from Esquire's review) it stars Jim
Carrey. Nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the
future will ever be able to top his role as Truman Burbank; mark my
word. For, as I said, this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of
the same calibre.
Forget special-effect ladden summer fodder. Drop your romantic comedies
in the trash. Toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile. You need
nothing more than "The Truman Show" to carry you through the summer, or
for that matter, the year.
Oh! And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and
goodnight.

This has been the finest movie that I have seen in a while.  I walked
into the theater with the praise for the movie ringing in my ears. "4
Stars!"  "Excellent...Drama becomes Carrey!" "Brilliant!"...
The movie follows Truman Burbank (Carrey) on his very own television
show - The Truman Show.  However, Truman doesn't know that it's a show
- he lives it unaware, as an audience of millions watches.  Truman
lives beneath a great dome - the largest soundstage ever constructed
(complete with 5000+ cameras) The entire operation is controlled by
Christof (Ed Harris), the director, from the "moon" - or what looks
like the moon to Truman.
The entire purpose of the setup is so that Truman can lead a "normal
life" - the life that Christof has planned for him.  Sure, bad things
happen to Truman, but he always bounces back.  Christof always assures
that.
Truman begins to question his world when things malfunction on the
inside.  He begins to ask questions about the nature of life and what
is real.  The movie follows his quest to find the answers.
The closest feeling that I can associate to this movie is the one I
felt after seeing Forrest Gump for the first time (actually, after
every time I see Gump.)  Harris is strangely father-like in his role.
He genuinely seems to love Truman as a son, yet he has to punish him
to get the ratings.  Some of the most powerful scenes are those where
Christof has to work against Truman.  Harris comes across genuine and
very human.
Carrey is beautiful in his role.  It almost seems as if it were meant
for him and only him.  You quickly forget his slapstick roles in "Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Dumb and Dumber."  He reminded me of Tom
Hanks to a certain extent - they both have the same sincerity around
them.  Carrey lays off the slapstick in the film almost entirely, and
if you don't expect it, you will miss it. (A gratification to some
people.)  Carrey also tugs at the viewer's heartstrings.  Remember
Robin Williams in "Dead Poet's Society"?  Carrey has the same effect
on the viewer.
Overall this film was the most excellent one I have seen this year.
As said earlier, it brings memories of "Forrest Gump" - the story of a
simple man trying to get the most out of life.

*** (out of 4) Truman ("true-man") Burbank is the perfect name for Jim
Carrey's character in this film. President Truman was an unassuming man who
became known worldwide, in spite of (or was it because of) his stature.
"Truman" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war, an era when
planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life
for Americans. And Burbank, California, brings to mind THE TONIGHT SHOW and
the home of NBC. If Hollywood is the center of the film world, Burbank is,
or was, the center of TV's world, the world where our protagonist lives.
Combine all these names and concepts into "Truman Burbank," and you get
something that well describes him and his artificial world. 
Truman leads the perfect life. His town, his car, and his wife are picture
perfect. His idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light
falls from the sky. The radio explains that an overflying airplane started
coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio
light? The next day during the drive to work, the radio jams and he starts
picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements. He is so distracted
that he nearly hits a pedestrian. When the radio comes back to normal, the
announcer warns listeners to drive carefully. His suspicion aroused, he
wanders around the town square looking for other oddities. The world appears
to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to
take the elevator. The elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people
on coffee breaks. A grip sees Truman him and quickly moves a paneled door,
made to look like the back of an elevator, into place. Two security guards
grab him and throw him out. 
Truman is really suspicious now. It gets even worse the next day when his
wife, a nurse, describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw
the lounge. "It's best not to think about it," she says, trying vainly to
change Truman's memory. Truman becomes determined to see who or what is
behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense. At every turn he is
stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own
little town. His last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the
edge of the world. 
You know by now that Truman's life is the subject of a television program.
His actions are "real" but everything else is carefully scripted, from the
death of his father to the choice of his wife. Truman is determined to find
out what the big hoax is. Meanwhile, Christof, the all-seeing creator of
Truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy. It's sort of
like WESTWORLD told from the robots' point of view, or JURASSIC PARK from
the dinosaurs' point of view. We root for the CAPTIVE of the cage-world. Our
protagonist is counting on "chaos theory" to help him escape his elaborate
trap. 
The story, written by Andrew Niccol (writer/director of GATTACA), introduces
some interesting questions, such as the ethics of subjecting a person to
this type of life, or the psychological impact of learning that your entire
life has all been fake. Although these questions came to mind, I don't think
the film itself asked them. It certainly didn't address them or try to
answer them.  I was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more
with the trauma of learning one's life is a TV show. Carrey's performance at
the end showed a smidgen of Truman's pain, but I almost felt that he got
over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing. 
Earlier in the movie I found myself wondering if it would be better for
Truman to find out the truth or whether I should root for him to be well.
The two seemed exclusive of one another, but Weir and Niccol didn't see it
that way. Perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it ISN'T, but
it seems like there were some missed opportunities here. 
But on its own terms, the movie is well made. Sight, sound and pacing are
all handled competently.  
Much of the first part of the movie IS The Truman Show. The scenes are all
apparently shot from hidden cameras, with snoots and obstructions covering
the corners of the screen. One hidden camera is apparently in his car radio,
the green LED numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen. 
The music is well-chosen and scored. The film opens with what sounds like
family drama theme music, when Truman's world is still beautiful and
perfect. When the movie ends, the score sounds more like a frantic, driven,
Tangerine Dream opus, while still keeping the same timbre. Philip Glass'
epic music (from POWAQQATSI) permeates Truman's scenes of suspicion and
awakening. (Glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show.) 
And the pacing of the story was brisk. There was no unnecessarily long setup
explaining the concept behind The Truman Show, just a few quick title cards,
a few interviews, and then right into the show, and the movie. One of the
first scenes is of the studio light falling; there was no token scene of
Truman's idyllic life before it falls apart, because it wasn't necessary, we
pick up the story at the first sign of trouble, and no sooner. There's also
no point in the movie where the plot slows down. It's a quick, straight shot
to the movie's end. 
In terms of overall quality, I would compare THE TRUMAN SHOW to Niccol's
GATTACA. Both films are well made with interesting stories set in
interesting worlds. But neither film really felt like it capitalized on all
the great ideas; neither film "clicked" and became an instant classic.
Nevertheless, I look forward to Niccol's next film, whatever it may be.

The notion that television is corrupt and that it corrupts minds is as old as
the invention of television itself. There have been a plethora of films
concentrating on this technological theme from the classic "Network" to the
recent successor "Wag the Dog." Both films are indictments against the idea
that television is the medium containing the message. "The Truman Show" is a
startlingly original, comically engaging portrait of a world where the medium
is not only the message, but it encapsulates an entire town. 
Rubber-faced clown Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman who
has a beautiful, almost too beaming wife (Laura Linney) whom he says good-bye
to before leaving for work. Every morning, Truman is greeted by his neighbors
and the townspeople to whom he responds with the catch phrase "Good morning.
Good evening, and good night." This Connecticut-style town where Truman lives
is Seahaven, a polished, "Father Knows Best" community completely and yet not
so completely removed from reality. It is reminiscent of a huge shopping mall
where there's no traffic, no noise, and no problems - everything is picture
perfect. Before you can whisper "The Stepford Wives," we gradually discover
(before Truman does) that nothing is what it seems. Apparently, Truman is the
unknowing star of a 24-hour television program where he is the main attraction
(and has been since birth), and his home in Seahaven is actually a giant,
dome-like television studio! To make matters worse, he is the star of the
biggest hit on television. 
The film's idea is like something out of "The Twilight Zone," but writer Andrew
Niccol fleshes out this story with care and humanity, as in a Ray Bradbury
novel. What could have been a one-joke premise becomes a deep, philosophical,
unusually poignant film. The humanity emanates from Jim Carrey's uncanny
Everyman character affected by the very people in his life - his mother who
reminds him of an ersatz Mount Rushmore vacation, his wife who may or may not
be a nurse and always wears a red sweater, his best friend (Noah Emmerich) who
brings a six-pack along every time Truman has a problem, a former girlfriend
(Natasha McElhone) hauled away by her father never to be seen again, and the
general townsfolk who try to put him in front of advertisements hung in the
town square. Truman's whole life is a fabrication - a lie for the sake of
entertaining millions of viewers on television, and the TV cameras are at every
corner of Truman's existence documenting his daily life. 
Jim Carrey is in super tip-top form here playing the bewildered Truman with
admirable restraint and complete assuredness. Don't expect fart jokes or
scatological humor of the "Ace Ventura" kind here; this is Carrey's first
dramatic role and he does wonders with it. At every turn, he suggests and
implies Truman's innocence, even when Truman starts to get suspicious about his
surroundings. It is a role Charlie Chaplin could have played with the same
degree of panache and heartbreak. My favorite scene is when Truman has an
argument with his wife and notices that she is addressing someone other than
himself when she utters:
And before I forget, there's the crucial role played by Ed Harris, who excels
like no other actor from movie to movie, and here he is at his unqualified best
as Cristof, the God-like creator of the show who barks orders such as "Cue the
sun!" or "Bring out the rain! Make the thunder louder!" Harris's final moments
where he discloses Truman's life, from his birth to his childhood memories, is
deeply touching and as emotionally discreet as this actor has ever been on
screen. 
"The Truman Show" is directed by Peter Weir ("The Last Wave," "Dead Poet's
Society") and he does a remarkably acute job of showing the world Truman
occupies which is not that different from what America is now becoming - a
Rockwellian nightmare where everyone pretends to be what they aren't. If Truman
is not real in his own eyes because of the part he unknowingly plays on
television, then who is he?

Starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney
Sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film. Sometimes you just 
have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride. I saw THE TRUMAN SHOW 
with an audience full of teenagers, most of whom were no doubt drawn by 
Ace Ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes. 
Surprised, they may have been, when they realized that this picture 
actually had something to say. But by the attentiveness of the crowd 
I'd say they were won over - as was I. I can't tell yet if Truman 
really is that good, or if it only seems that good in comparison to the 
awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of Hollywood so far 
this year. Time alone will make that call. But by the end of the film we 
were all on Truman Burbank's side. We were concerned for his 
well-being, and wanted him to win. That we felt as we did is a tribute 
both to the film and to Jim Carrey, who has achieved legitimacy at last.
THE TRUMAN SHOW is a film best viewed cold, with as little foreknowledge 
as possible about the plot. Unless you're under a media blackout, 
however, you probably know the basics. Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, a 
Capra-esque Everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife 
Meryl (Laura Linney) in the South Florida island town of Seahaven, which 
looks like Michael Eisner's idea of the perfect American small town. 
Truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle, complete 
with a working wife, a best bud, friendly neighbors and interesting 
co-workers. There is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a 
horrible boating accident, leaving Truman with a dreadful fear of water, 
and of travel in general - but overall, life is good.
But then one day as Truman leaves his house for work, a klieg light 
falls magically from the sky. This curious event may lead Truman to 
discover what the rest of the world already knows: that he is a prisoner 
on the world's biggest soundstage, that his wife, friends and 
relatives are all actors paid to interact with him, and that his life 
has, for over 10,000 days, been broadcast as the world's most popular 
television program.
What makes the first hour of TRUMAN so enjoyable to watch is the magical 
verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by Niccol and Weir. The 
soundstage, we're told, is "only the second man-made structure visible 
from space." Truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5,000 
cameras scattered throughout the town: button cams, dashboard cams, 
mirror cams, wife cams, big cams and small cams. Weir cuts the film so 
we're never quite sure if we're watching Truman through the camera 
of director Weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent 
creator Christof(Ed Harris) who oversees the show from a control room 
built into the man-made moon in Seahaven's sky.
The second act offers a plethora of clues for Truman as to the truth of 
his existence. His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) always has a six 
pack of beer with him. His wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial 
in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product. He 
sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town. One 
wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier, but Christof has 
an answer for this: "People tend to accept the reality with which 
they're presented." Nevertheless, Truman begins to grow restless, and 
dreams of escape to Fiji, where an old college sweetheart (Natasha 
McElhone) supposedly lives.
This convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a 
magical and provocative concept; the best thing Jim Carrey does is stay 
out of its way. By underplaying Truman, he allows the subtle 
manipulations of the film to take over. There is a particularly poignant 
scene in which Truman confides his fears to Marlon, and Marlon answers 
with best-friend sincerity, "I'd gladly step in front of a bus for 
you." But that line was fed to Marlon through an earpiece by Christof. 
The abject cruelty to which Truman is subjected to hits home - and from 
that moment, we're on his side.
THE TRUMAN SHOW derives much of its success from playing to our own 
secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all, at least once, doubted 
our place in the world, doubted the sincerity of those closest to us? 
Ultimately, however, the picture rises above its own artifice to raise 
some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator. 
What does God really think of us? Does He resent our abandonment of 
paradise? Who exactly is watching us, up there in the sky? If you enjoy 
the picture as much as I did, credit Weir for allowing the magic of the 
screenplay to work. As for Carrey - well, Truman Burbank is the kind of 
role that Jimmy Stewart was born to play. Carrey is no Jimmy Stewart; to 
his credit, he doesn't try to be. He just tries to feel the way you or 
I would, if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us.

It must be some sort of warped critical nightmare:  the best movie of
the year would be a summer vehicle, a Jim Carrey vehicle at that.  And
so it is.  _The Truman Show_ is the most perplexing, crazed, paranoid
and rib-tickling morality play I've seen since I-don't-know-when.
Don't credit Carrey.  It starts with Andrew Niccol (Gattaca), who
created the script ten years ago.  The story, replete with sublte
religious and philisophical undertones, is about a man who discovers
that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience.
(Ironically, it was within these past ten years that "reality-based"
television have become a predominant fixture into our culture.  Who
knew?)
One-upping Niccol, it was when unlikely candidate-director Peter Weir
took the helm that things fell into place.  Weir had the nearly
impossible task to create the unimitible tone, deftly mixing Capra with
Kafka, throwing George Bailey in a universe inhabited by Rod Serling.
It was Weir's first stroke of genius to create Seahaven: a suburban
paradise/prison that would make Spielberg cower in shame. For example,
bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers
along with the latest issue of _Dog Fancy_.  The nicest touch are the
plethora of subtle hints for Truman to _not_ leave the island.
Credit Weir for his second stroke: the casting of Carrey.  Carrey seems
to be the type of character actor who would always turn "on" and act
goofy whenever the camera is near.  Not here.  His performance is so
subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on.
And although Carrey does not deserve an Academy Award nomination (just
as well, the Academy rarely honors goofy comedians, excepting Robin
Williams), he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image
considerably.  Playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his
most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of Jim Carrey's life.
No pun intended.
Better in a smaller, more pivotal role is Ed Harris as Christof, who
mixes the right amount of his Apollo 13 "work the problem, people"
character with Dustin Hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _Wag the Dog_,
and then only slightly Svengalian.  It is clear that he is torn between
the Nielson ratings and Truman's well being.  Yes, in his own misguided
way he loves Truman as a father to a son, and has provided the best
universe he could provide.  He thinks.
Rounding out the cast is Natascha McElhone (Mrs. Dalloway) as Carrey's
true "forbidden love", Sylvia, very effective in another pivotal small
role.  Laura Linney (Congo) and Noah Emmerich (Copland) have the
unfortunate task of playing Truman's wife and best friend; their
sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character
development.  The exception is at the very beginning, where they speak
into the camera, wholeheartedly believing that their participation is
truly good for Truman, and for society in general.
There are other little problems with the script.  Are we to assume that
toddler Truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a
gigantic dome during his formative years?  Was there any reason as to
why in one scene, it rained solely on Truman, even though it never had
to?  How is it they hire hundreds of extras, and none of them could
drive a boat, and yet Truman, fearful of water, is helming a sailboat
effortlessly?  And couldn't Christof have turned off the wind, to strand
Truman at sea?
These little contrivances, however, do not hold a candle to the overall
effect of the work.  The audience gets the feeling that it is watching
the actual show, and we are drawn to Truman's mundane existence for no
other reason than it is there.  The final result effortlessly combines
the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing
discomfort that hits you square in the gut.  Upon leaving the theater, I
was looking up in the sky, wondering if it was nothing more than a
gigantic dome. Just checking.

Who would have thought? Jim Carrey does drama. When I first saw the
advertisement for The Truman Show, I thought, "What a hilarious idea for a
movie!" However, it was an even better premise for a drama.
The Truman Show takes us into a world that revolves around one man. That man is
Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Truman has no clue what is really going on in his
world and frankly, Cristof wants to keep it that way. Christof is the "god" of
this made-up world. He keeps everything running and gives the actors their
roles. There were a few attempts to tell Truman about his world, but they
failed and life went on as normal.
The opening parts of the film introduce to Truman's world. We see what he is
doing at his current age, then we get a flashback at his past. It may seem a
tad boring, but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film
right from the start.
The film can be described in one word: weird. It seems like such a simple idea,
yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of, but Andrew
Niccol did. It seems like a warped idea, but it is Andrew's idea and he did
wonders with it.
Jim Carrey actually lived up to the hype. The hype, whether good or bad, always
focused on Carrey's ability to do drama. No one doubted how extraordinary this
film could be, the only thing they doubted was Carrey. And he showed them all
up. Jim Carrey was snubbed at the Oscars. I do not think he was the best actor,
but he deserved the nomination. He plays Truman Burbank, the unsuspecting star
of the most popular television show in the world. He has lived a normal life
for almost thirty years, but then strange things start happening. He ventures
into the wrong elevator. A light crashes in front of him. His father comes back
and is then pulled away. We are constantly teased with all of this and we know
it is a show, but Truman does not. And it is just a constant progression that
never gets sluggish. Carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in
a major drama. 
Laura Linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife. She plays her role as
advertiser and budding star to a point. Peter Weir does not make the cast
perfect, and their flaws eventually lead to Truman's escape. The story unfolds
until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down.
Despite Carrey's greatness, the best performance in The Truman Show undoubtedly
is turned in by Ed Harris, who plays the "god" of Truman's world. He displays
the pressure he is under, the world he has created. He becomes so paranoid that
he believes he is a god and that Truman has him to thank for his sham of a
life.
The action moves at a good pace, and rarely gets sluggish. But, the main point
of the film is how it looks like a television show. It really makes you think.
Maybe your brother is an actor, maybe your best friend is in heated contract
negotiations to stay on the show. Some of the best parts of the film are when
Truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee
and talking. Or when Truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being
said for Truman's arrival. And when Christof focuses in on Truman and cues the
dramatic music as Marlon (Noah Emmerich) delivers his dramatic line. All of
these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative. I was not
only enjoying the film, I was overwhelmed by genius of it. 
Overall, The Truman Show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come
out of Hollywood. Jim Carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million
faces, but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best. Andrew
Niccol is responsible for the screenplay and Peter Weir pulled it off to
perfection. The Truman Show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in
general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film.

This is going to be hard to say, but I'll say it because it's the truth:
Jim Carrey can act.
Carrey shows restraint as Truman Burbank, a man trapped unknowingly in a
live TV broadcast of his life. Discarded as an unwanted baby, he is the
first child to be adopted by a corporation. Truman's life is the center of
The Truman Show. The show is the creation of TV director Christof (Ed
Harris) who watches over Truman like a father.
A series of events lead Truman to dig deeper into his life, causing him to
find out that his life may have been fabricated. His wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney), his best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and his parents -- could
they all just be actors?
Writer Andrew Niccol (who directed and wrote last year's Gattacca) takes
the idea of a guy stuck in a TV show and runs with it. He makes us think:
Could our own lives be fabricated? How much acting do people around us do?
And Niccol brings meaning to Shakespeare's "All the world's a stage."; in
The Truman Show everyone is an actor except for Truman himself.
The Truman Show opens with the line: We're tired of pyrotechnics and
special effects And we are, let's have some creativity in Hollywood, let's
have some originality, let's have a movie that doesn't rely on computer
generated mutated iguanas. The Truman Show delivers on its laughs and it
delivers on a well-written story.
I've never completely liked Carrey. From his stint on In Living Color to
his movies afterwards, I never liked his rubber-faced antics, and sometimes
childish-for-shock humor. Lately though, some of his work has been
impressive. His "turn to drama" role in Liar Liar was enjoyable. His work
in The Mask was fitting. In The Truman Show, Carrey holds off on almost all
of his antics - there are still times where they show up - and it works for
the best. The Truman Show is a showcase for Carrey, showing that he can do
other stuff than the crap that he did in the Pet Detective movies.
Will Carrey ever be a Robin Williams? Maybe, but there is something about
Williams that Carrey just does not have. I can't put my finger on it, but
if you also feel the same please let me know.
Director, Peter Weir, should be given a lot of credit for the work he's
done with The Truman Show. The docu-drama look of the film works well and
does not become overly distracting. The humor is there and always works --
I loved the posters warning about travel in the travel agency office.
For those looking for an all out Jim Carrey comedy, like the Pet Detective
films, you'll be disappointed. The trailers for The Truman Show promote the
film wrongly: as a comedy. The Truman Show is more of a satirical look at
the wrongs of our society. Unlike most all of Carrey's old films its a
thinking film.
Worth mentioning is the costume design by Marilyn Matthews and the
production design by Dennis Gassner. Matthew's costume design is old yet
very new. Complimenting this look are Gassner's sets which look so modern
but incorporate older designs that they are pleasing but not distracting. I
loved the look of The Truman Show.
If you avoid Jim Carrey films because of his antics, you might want to see
The Truman Show; you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's a fun film that is a
satire on the way our society stands. If not, just see it because it is a
beautiful looking film with some laugh-out-loud moments. I never thought
I'd say this about a Jim Carrey film, but: Don't Miss The Truman Show.

To best enjoy "The Truman Show," there's a couple of things you need to 
do. First, disregard the hype. Ads for the film use a quote from Esquire 
calling it "The Movie Of The Decade." That sort of hyperbole does nothing 
but raise audience expectations to such an unrealistic level that 
disappointment is inevitable. Second, try to put aside any preconceptions 
you have about Jim Carrey. If you loved his rubber-faced antics in films 
like "Ace Ventura," you need to understand that he doesn't do that here. 
Conversely, those who dismiss Carrey as a juvenile embarrassment, the 
Jerry Lewis of the apocalypse, should realize that there's more to the 
man than his geeky persona suggests. This is Carrey's breakthrough movie, 
where he finally takes the lampshade off his head and proves that he can 
act. 
Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the first child legally adopted by a 
corporation. From the moment of his birth, Truman has been the unknowing 
star of the most popular TV series in history, a 24 hour a day epic about 
him. Truman lives in Seahaven, an idyllic small town which is actually a 
gigantic set inside a huge domed studio. The beautiful blue skies and 
gorgeous sunsets are all special effects, and the entire population of 
Seahaven are actors, except for Truman Burbank. Raised in this idealized, 
artificial world, Truman shares a home with a fake wife, spends his days 
at a fake job, and confides his hopes and fears to his fake best friend, 
unaware that 5,000 cameras are monitoring his every move. Unaware, that 
is, until one day when the blue sky rips and a stage light plummets from 
above and crashes on the street near him. Minutes later, while driving to 
work, he hears a newscast offering a contrived explanation for the 
occurrence. Truman changes channels, only to pick up a radio signal 
broadcasting stage instructions to the Seahaven crew. Realizing that 
something very strange is going on, Truman begins to examine his world, 
and the game is afoot.
Director Peter Weir ("Gallipoli," "The Year of Living Dangerously" 
"Witness") has created a whale of a good movie, a rich, entertaining, 
thoughtful work that is at once lyrical and ominous. Wisely, he lets the 
audience in on the premise from the beginning, through a faux documentary 
about the phenomenal success of "The Truman Show," including footage of 
giddy fans hooked on the program. We meet the show's creator, a quietly 
intimidating "visionary" named Christof, played by the wonderful Ed 
Harris, who gives a masterful, Oscar-worthy performance as the brooding 
artist. Christof, who fancies himself as Truman's ersatz father figure, 
defends the purity and integrity of his creation, even when challenged 
during a call-in program by a young woman who lost her job as an extra in 
the show when she made direct contact with Truman and tried to tell him 
the truth about his "reality." In addition to providing entertainment for 
millions, Christof patiently explains, he's actually doing Truman a 
service by giving him a world much more desirable than the real one.
Indeed, Peter Weir made some interesting choices in creating Truman's un-
real world. He crafts a highly stylized environment in Seahaven, a 
disquieting cross between the Village from the classic TV series "The 
Prisoner" and Mayfield, the Cleaver's hometown in "Leave It To Beaver." 
Squeaky clean and homogenized, Seahaven feels like the setting for an old 
sit-com, and the actors amplify the mood, smiling too broadly as they 
exchange banalities and awkwardly insert product placements into Truman's 
life. In the center of the surrealism, Carrey initially plays his role 
much like the Darren Stevens character from the old "Bewitched" series. 
His expressions and gestures are almost cartoonish, understandable when 
you look at the context in which Truman was raised. As Truman gradually 
becomes aware that his life is a facade, Carrey's acting turns more and 
more realistic, intensifying the nightmarish journey of a man trying to 
escape from a Stepford world.
Beyond its immense value as pure entertainment, "The Truman Show" is a 
subversive piece of work, genially assaulting the jaded, voyeuristic 
culture of the 90's. Weir offers a society where the most popular show in 
existence is an endless peepshow focused on the utterly mundane life of 
an insurance agent. He suggests our world has become so ugly that 
millions would take comfort in imagined intimacy with a familiar 
character in pleasant surroundings, even if their hero is a virtual 
prisoner and the utopia is phony and bland. It would be easy to dismiss 
the film as just a well-done paranoid fantasy, were it not for the 
enduring popularity of "The Real World," "Cops" and "The Jerry Springer 
Show." The sad truth is that "The Truman Show" is already running and 
we're watching it every day.

Starring: Jim Carey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich.
A movie like The Truman Show is really hard to come to terms with. For
a start, there's all the hype associated with it. I like to go into a
movie with very little idea of what's about to unfold, making it
possible for me to judge a movie on its content alone. With the
publicity machine and the positive word of mouth that is associated
with this movie, it's close to impossible to do that.  Consequently,
I'm heading in to The Truman Show with a whole lot of baggage, not the
least of which is the notion that everyone else loves it. Second, it's
one of these movies where it's not clear whether the film maker is
being clever, or whether the reviewers/audience members are reading
something that's not there. I'll come back to this point. Given these
concerns, my capsule summary would be that it's quite enjoyable but
not all that it's billed to be.
This is yet again a movie advertised to be Jim Carey in his first
serious role. While Carey does a competent job with the part of Truman
(Truman, for goodness sake; has no-one heard of subtlety?), it is by
no means the stand-out performance of the year. His part is still a
caricature: an over-the-top, hammed-up performance.  His appearance in
Cable Guy was streets ahead of what's happening here.
As I try to discuss the performances, I come up against the point I
made in the opening paragraph: what is this movie really trying to do?
I think there are a couple of possible ways to read it.
i) Is it meant to be about a real person who was caught up in this
artificial, televised world? We are shown many details that seem to
suggest that this is the case: intricacies of how this event is staged
are revealed, to a level that is meant to convince us that it is
feasible; certain actors (Noah Emmerlich as the best friend for
example) play their parts in the television show as if it is meant to
be real; the shots of the general public again suggest that this is a
real phenomenon.
      Ultimately, however, The Truman Show falls well short. The whole
concept just doesn't bear close scrutiny under this premise. Firstly,
how exciting would it really be to televise someone's life 24 hours a
day? Even if it was deliberately filled with choreographed events,
there's just way too much mundaneness to fill the screen. We're told
that people leave the television on at night to sleep while Truman is
sleeping, a reasonable premise only if you're in the same time
zone. Ok, that takes care of the night but what about travelling to
work every day, sitting at work for eight hours, showering, eating?
How often would that be interesting and are people really going to be
watching continuously, just in case something interesting happens? And
don't even think about what the actor who is playing the wife is
called upon to do. Also, (spoiler following but if you don't realise
that this is going to happen in the movie, then there are a lot of
Hollywood movies out there that you can enjoy), if you had spent all
your life living in what you thought was reality only to find out that
it was a television set, don't you think you'd have some sort of
pretty serious nervous breakdown?  Add to this Laura Linney
shamelessly over-acting in the role of Truman's wife and Jim Carey
hamming it up and it just can't be real.
ii) Clearly it must be an allegory. Let's treat the pieces that
suggested realism as merely attempts to make the allegory plausible,
so that we can't just brush the film away as something that could
never happen. Then what's the film trying to say about human
existence? We watch too much television? We need to question our
reality more? The media is manipulative? What is life but a series of
events, orchestrated by some unseen conductor, where we are not even
the players but rather the instruments?
      Well, The Truman Show could be saying any of these things. This
is where it all comes down to interpretation. Is the movie being so
clever that it's not forcing its message down the viewer's throat,
touching on all these issues but ultimately leaving it up to the
audience to do some work and take away what they can from it? Or, is
it simply a collection of interesting ideas rather than a coherent
allegory, thrown together to make up the mandatory 2 hours? Much as
I'm a huge fan of Peter Weir, I fear it is the latter rather than the
former. (For an movie that fits into the former category, see Peter
Weir's Fearless.)
      The Truman Show seems to be one of those movies created from an
idea thrown around at lunch time. The concept is not a particularly
original one: since philosophising began, people have postulated the
idea that everything around us is a figment of our imagination. All I
can know is myself: what proof do I have of other people's existence?
Well, I'll take it on trust that the reality I see is
reality. Alright, let's take this concept.  Suppose the reality I see
isn't reality. Wouldn't that make a cool movie? But what can I really
do with this concept now? One of two things: either the protagonist
discovers that the reality isn't real or he doesn't. Well, it's not
much of a movie if he doesn't, so he'd better discover it.
      With whom are we meant to identify in this movie? Truman?
Perhaps, but I think instead the intention is that we identify with
the viewers of the television show. In this way, we can watch what's
going on with a knowing complicity: Truman should question reality but
we know we live in the real world. Ultimately perhaps this is the
point of the movie: are we really any better off in our real world,
watching Truman, than Truman is in his orchestrated one? If so, again
there are problems. The choice of the television viewers seems
disingenuous, to say the least. Are they meant to represent the
ordinary people? Two bar-maids, two security guards, a slob in a
bathtub and two old crones, none of whom are tremendously
appealing. They're really there for their comic potential, rather than
for their representation of the everyperson. We never get to know them
well; in face, we never really get to know anyone well, not even
Truman. As such, I'm not drawn in to this movie, and I don't really
care too much about the plight of anyone. In this position, it's hard
to get caught up in the allegory.  The media manipulates? Not here. I
don't care about anyone.  Question my reality? My life's not like
anyone's in the movie so that doesn't apply.  There's a conductor
manipulating the events of my life? If so, my only choice seems to be
to leave. It seems that as an allegory, The Truman Show is not a
roaring success either.
All this suggests that I'm slamming The Truman Show, but that's not my
intention.  All I'm saying is that it's a bit confusing, since
different actors seem to think they're in different movies. It's also
a bit disappointing since there seem to be some interesting directions
the movie could have chosen to go but didn't. Overall, however, The
Truman Show is mostly a moderately interesting movie with nowhere near
the depth that it's purported to have.

        "The Truman Show", the latest in an intriguing series of films by
director Peter ("Witness") Weir, is a thought-provoking fantasy about a fic-
tional television program.  In it, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)'s life has been
broadcast since birth on a hermetically sealed island town called Sea Haven.
Truman goes through his daily routine, completely unaware that everyone around
him are paid performers who mold his fate.  It's a great concept, one that can
be interpreted differently by viewers of different ages.  Children (albeit old-
er or sharp ones) could find a compelling conceit in the idea that everything
in existence revolves around you, and if you're alert enough, you'll be able to
spot the seams in the deception.  Teenagers could see it as an escape picture,
rebellion from the opressive misconceptions of the previous generation.  Older
viewers may see it as a call to re-examine their lives, to challenge the com-
fortable patterns that may be smothering crucial needs still unfufilled. Even if
you remain on the surface level, it's still a pretty clever escape picture.
        Weir does a terrific job setting up the concept visually, letting the
audience get a significant distance into its running time before throwing back
the sheet on Truman's make-believe world.  Almost every shot is staged to feel
clandestine, the camera placed again and again in convincing locations to put
the viewer in between the television audience and the show's creators.  We see
how someone can be filmed all day long without the shot angles feeling gimmicky
or forced.
        The film opens as Truman's world begins to unravel -- as thoroughly
as Sea Haven's island community seems to be orchestrated, events continue to
build to his ultimate discovery of his lifelong deception by the show's crea-
tor, Christof (subtly played by Ed Harris).  It's really entertaining to see
the lengths that the production team will go to in order to preserve the illu-
sion -- young Truman shows an early interest in exploration, only to have it 
immedately squashed by his teacher.  We also gain sympathy for Truman as the 
methods for maintaining his limited life become crueler and more stringent --
he is molded into a frightened, unambitious man in order to prevent him from
desiring life beyond what has been created for him in the huge dome that sur-
rounds his world.  When Truman falls in love with a woman other than the act-
ress slated to be his wife, she is summarily removed from the show.  
        Many of the mistakes and accidents that do occur are explained away by
cast members or radio broadcasts or other factors, but eventually, as Truman 
becomes more suspicious and acts less and less predictably, making him harder
and harder to control, he discovers the ghosts in the machine -- or at least 
sees enough to provoke further testing of the show's defense mechanisms, which
in turn provoke a stronger desire for escape, to explore the world that has al-
ways fascinated him.  The struggle is great drama, and the ratings are terri-
fic -- audiences all over the world, initially attracted to watching a 'real'
life progressing in time yet permanently static, become tranfixed with Truman's
efforts to discover what lies beyond the life he's always known.  Some in the
audience feel that Truman's life is cruel and unusual punishment, and protest
for his release.
        The film's story is essentially simple -- Truman discovers the maze 
and struggles to solve it and take his place in the real world.  Will he ulti-
mately find freedom, or be crushed in an enviroment where every element -- even
the weather -- conspires to contain him?  Weir uses many striking visuals to
dramatize the concept.  The population of Sea Haven wait motionless early in the
morning, awaiting Truman's entry like the robots from "Westworld".  The towns-
people, discovering that Truman is missing, link arms and sweep the entire town
to flush him out and continue the show (a truly creepy and terrific sequence).
The figurehead of Truman's stolen boat, a golden eagle, thrusts out above the 
water as he pilots it out into the unknown.  Christof tenderly stroking a huge
video image of Truman as he lies asleep.
        The latter image brings another dimension to the creator/creation con-
flict.  We are clearly encourged to think of humanity and God in conflict (as
a last resort, "Christ"-of broadcasts to Truman directly, his voice booming 
down from a dawn-lit sky), yet on another level, we can see creator/creation in
less philosophical terms as a parent-child conflict, with the central theme
as maturity, forming one's own perspective through a partial rejection of the
imparted parental world.  Christof can be seen as the ultimate overprotective
parent, literally creating for his surrogate son an entire world safe from the
(ironically) lies and pain of the real world.  As in some of Weir's other films,
the protagonist is privy to an experience that isolates him from others (as in
"The Mosquito Coast" or "Fearless") and forces him to put himself at risk.
        Andrew ("Gattaca") Niccol wrote the script for "The Truman Show", and
like that film, its merits are primarily conceptual -- its emotional themes are
to a degree in shorthand, but still effective: Truman creates a composite por-
trait of his first love with pictures torn from fashion magazines, Truman re-
unites with his dead father when (dissatisfied with how he was dispatched from
the plot) the performer unexpectedly returns on the set.  If we had seen and
felt a stronger bond between them, this reunion could have been extremely pow-
erful in highlighting the emotional cruelty that lies beneath the placid sur-
face of Truman's life.  Similarly, more could have been made of the performers
who support Truman, but feel powerless to help him.
        The technical efforts here are fine -- Dennis Gassner's production de-
sign clearly defines the real world versus the television show; Peter Biziou's
cinematography also attractively supports the concept.  The score sports a var-
iety of styles -- Philip Glass and Chopin among them -- yet it coheres and 
more than embellishes the film's emotional impact.  The editors might have used
this concept as an excuse for showy effects, but William M. Anderson and Lee
Smith keep things clear and on an even keel when appropriate.  Look for Harry 
Shearer in a well-used cameo.  Recommended.

Peter Weir's dazzling daydream `The Truman Show' has been tabbed as this
year's `Forrest Gump,' but a more worthy comparison might be Frank Capra's
`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Like that 1939 classic starring James
Stewart in the title role, `Truman' is about a guileless Everyman who
gradually confronts the vast, corrupt forces of cynicism that surround him.
In Capra's world, the setting was the vulgar world of capital politics. In
Weir's, it's much more ominous and to-the-point in our corporatized,
media-poisoned times. This time, Mr. Smith goes to cable.
Television has never looked so cancerous as it does in `The Truman Show,' a
surreal and immensely likable fable that straddles the line between comedy
and drama. Starring the elastic superstar Jim Carrey, `Truman' is set in a
postcard-perfect little seacoast town called Seahaven, as clean and orderly
as a Hollywood back-lot. In fact, it is a back-lot, an enormous,
climate-controlled Xanadu of a TV studio where everyone is an actor playing
a role and 5,000 hidden cameras broadcast the goings-on 24 hours a day to a
worldwide TV audience that dwarves `Seinfeld's' ratings.
The only guy not working from a script is the show's star, Truman Burbank
(Carrey), an amiable doofus who's been on candid camera since birth. He has
no idea that his every waking (and sleeping) moment is providing the world
with a compelling fix of voyeurism.
Watching on from a studio hidden behind Seahaven's fake moon is the show's
creator (or Creator, if you prefer), a quietly sinister character named
Christof (Ed Harris) who stage-manages every moment of Truman's life from
spoon-feeding lines to the actors who play his intimates to staging
elaborate hoaxes to keep Truman from learning the truth.
One of the many delights in this smart fantasy is Seahaven itself, a kind
of Stepford town whose ersatz charms have shaped Truman into what he is, a
decent fellow whose whole value system has been shaped by the mock
sincerity of a '50s sitcom. Especially creepy is Truman's wife Meryl (Laura
Linney), a dimpled blonde whose sing-song June-Cleaver-on-Prozac schtick is
put to use on nakedly commercial product placements or to dissuade Truman
from thinking too hard about his circumstances.
Weir, the Australian director whose lucid, penetrating pictures include
`Witness' and `Dead Poets Society,' makes several interesting choices. We
don't go behind the scenes of `The Truman Show' until about half way
through, allowing Weir to guide us through the unreality of Truman's world
as he lives it. One of the first signs that all is not well in Truman's
world is when a stage light drops out of the clear blue sky right at
Truman's feet. Instead of bringing us backstage where a roomful of
technicians are cursing their luck, Weir keeps us with Truman as he gets in
his car and hears an outlandish news report on the radio that a satellite
is dropping parts from the sky.
Soon, the enormity of the con becomes apparent when we are lifted into the
`real world,' (whatever that is) to learn just how big Truman's life is to
couch potatoes all over the world. Ed Harris as the lordly Christof
smolders with a kind of divine self-importance. He tells us that Truman is
the first child legally adopted by a corporation, that there had been a few
close calls with outsiders breaking into the set to tell Truman the truth.
What's going on here? Clearly, the response to this film (and I think it
will be a tremendous one) will have a lot to do with a growing unease about
corporate media and it's increasing lack of respect for the dignity of
privacy. Ultimately, `The Truman Show' is a film about paranoia,
justifiable paranoia. The public sphere is filled with surveillance cameras
these days, marketing is all about gathering personal information and the
courts have not shown much in the way of defending the so-called `right to
privacy.' Post-O.J., post-Diana, a scenario like `The Truman Show' becomes
a more and more vivid reminder that media realities, however true-to-life,
are contrived realities and our thirst for vicarious thrills trumps our
respect for other's dignity.
On another level, `The Truman Show' isn't about the mass media at all, but
rather a media-drenched take on mysticism. When Christof's says, in
explaining Truman's 30-year cluelessness about the forces shaping his life,
that `we accept the reality we are presented with,' he's talking about you
and me as well as poor oblivious Truman.
`The Truman Show' will give both the sane and questionably sane reason to
ponder the significance of coincidence and fate. But, as if to remind us of
our complicity in the sad life of Truman Burbank, Peter Weir brings it all
back to the curse of television with a devastating final shot. If all the
world's a stage, there's always another play going on somewhere.

Think of a movie that is entertaining, yet deep; intelligent but not 
uncomprehensible; a movie about events of normal daily life, but with 
a truly original plot. Make it funny, but not a comedy. Serious, but
not preachy. 
Sounds impossible? The Truman Show proves that it can be done. 
One of the best movies produced by Hollywood in recent memory, The Truman 
Show succeeds in such a scale that, to quote movie critic Don Irvine,
"at times it contends for 'best film of the decade'." 
Now when was the last time you heard a critic say such things about 
a movie starring Jim Carrey?
This film is not without its risks. It presuposes the general public 
dislikes art films because of their snobery and slow pace, but if only 
one made the whole experience entertaining and non-elitist, the public 
would enjoy intelligent material as much as they do watching action 
film or romantic comedies.
To judge from this week's box office receipts it is so.

One criticism that many have made about today's television shows is that
it contains too little realism.  What we view are gross exaggerations,
lurid sensationalism running wild.  Witness the trashy talk shows, the
nutty soap operas, pay-per-view fiascoes, prime-time wrestling, and "oh
no...they killed Kenny!"  Is that why a show such as Seinfeld was so
popular?  Because they covered topics that seemed so ordinary that they
were downright insightful?  The public clamors for something real to
watch, and they get it in "The Truman Show."
Now in his 30th year, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has been the unknowing
star of his own show since he was born.  As he goes about his daily life
and interacts with the city's denizens, thousands of hidden cameras
follow him around, revealing to the audience every little detail of his
life.  Truman has no idea that his life has been carefully planned and
that all the world is a stage.  We're there when he suffers tragedy,
when he takes his first steps, and when he experiments with his first
kiss.  Truman eventually finds his life too comfortable.  An uneasiness
begins to gnaw at him.  The only thing that ever gave him spark was a
brief encounter with a girl whom he met in college who mysteriously
disappeared.  "I'm getting out of here," he exclaims.  But to actually
leave the community would mean the end of the show, and the producer (Ed
Harris) does what he can to keep Truman trapped in his storybook land.
"The Truman Show" is an elegantly constructed movie that explores two
things.  The first is Truman's growing realization that his whole life
has been some sort of masquerade.  He picks up clues here and there such
as the wife that talks like a television commercial, radio channels
whose announcer tells where Truman is heading, and a lifestyle that's
unrealistically harmonious.  He knows that finding his own truth
requires risks.  He is willing to shed his affable nature in search of
adventure.  The more interesting aspect, however, is the debate that
ensues between the producer of the show and a former cast member who
severely questions his ethics and accuses him of deceit and using
technology and media to satiate some kind of twisted appetite of the
public.  Ratings override his sense of humanitarianism, and thus the
direction of the movie soon becomes clear.  Who will win out?  Those
that seek the truth for personal betterment or those that manipulate the
facts in order to stave off change?
Carrey turns in a surprisingly good performance, and shows that he has
the ability to be both a manic comic and a person that can project a
sense of wonderment and awe.  It's easy for us to sympathize with Carrey
and as the movie progresses, we struggle with him and become a part of
his life.  The storytelling quickly draws us in, and we become as
interested as the viewing audience depicted in the movie.  "The Truman
Show" is a unique movie, his journey is immensely satisfying, and Carrey
is engrossing as a man who learns that there's nothing more important
than taking that first step.

At some point in nearly everyone's life, one begins to wonder exactly how
real his perception of the world is. Usually between the ages of 30 and 40,
most people realize that they have been looking at life through glasses made
of lenses ground first by their parents, then by teachers and continually by
the media.
Then there is the painful choice of accepting that view or attempting to get
out of the box that surrounds us and form our own vision. No wonder that time
of life is often referred to as a mid-life crisis.
Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is having one hell of a 30th year. Beginning with
a studio light that mysteriously falls out of the perfect blue sky and
followed by odd "coincidences", he begins to believe that the world is
revolving around him. In real life this would be called paranoia or delusions
of grandeur. Here it's because, unbeknownst to him, Burbank is the subject of
a 24 hour a day television series: the most popular show in the nation.
Adopted by a corporation at birth, his life has been broadcast to the world
since his day one. Now at day 10,909, he's discovered that something is amiss.
Everyone -- his wife, his best friend, the bus driver -- in his flawless
hometown of Seahaven (filmed in the sanitized Florida community of Seaside) is
an actor.
Even the town is a movie set with 5,000 hidden cameras under a huge dome. The
sun and moon rise and set by command of series director Christof (Ed Harris
who stepped in after Dennis Hopper left), he of the godlike name. All of
Truman's experiences and emotions are manipulated by Christof's whispers to
the actors. Truman lives in the ultimate fascist state.
An actress extra is yanked from the set when she and Truman begin to form an
attachment to each other because it wasn't in the script. While she is trying
to tell him that his life is a fake, she is hustled away by an actor playing
her father.
The movie owes much to "The Prisoner" television series, but the show within
the film reminds me of the slow-speed OJ Simpson car chase. Perhaps the best
television ever, the extended chase was riveting because it was real and
because nothing was happening, yet all eyes were on the tube. In this film,
viewers watch Truman going about his mundane day. He leads an idyllic life
and, like the chase, nothing much takes place...until he opens his eyes.
The audience watches him working, eating and sleeping. They give up their
lives (in one scene a baby screams while its parents ignore him, glued to the
set) to watch Truman eat dinner. We have become a country of voyeurs enjoying
the bread and circuses.
Strangely enough with all of the overly-long films recently, this one feels
too short. I wanted to know more. It is frustrating that the movie ends on the
brink of potentially the most interesting aspect of Truman's life. Like the
television audience, I want to watch.
Although turning in a marvelous job, director Australian Peter Weir ("Picnic
At Hanging Rock", "Witness", "The Year Of Living Dangerously") is a bit
heavy-handed with the metaphors. It's obvious that the film is about our
media-manipulated lives and the struggle to escape the shell of control. A
more subtle approach would have worked better.
Weir has a history of casting actors (Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, Mel
Gibson) in films that change their careers. Jim Carrey is no exception. Moving
from his hilarious television work in "The Duck Factory" and "In Living Color"
to the money-making but remarkably insipid "Ace Ventura" films, Carrey made
his living with broad comedy and a rubber face. Taking a chance in the daring
but flawed dark comedy "The Cable Guy", he signaled a change in direction. Now
with "The Truman Show", Carrey has completed his about-face. Reining himself
in, the actor is still hilarious at times, but there's a human here not just a goofball.
The supporting cast is up to the task. Each walks the fine line between
portraying a television character and portraying an actor playing a character.
The standout is Harris as the all-powerful megalomaniac on high.
The promotion of this film must have been a challenge. It was ready for
release last year, delayed for a few months and then delayed again. The studio
has decided to advertise it as a comedy. People who walk into the theater
expecting to see nonsensical Carrey antics are going to be surprised.
It's much easier to watch someone else than to have our own experiences. It's
seductive to be concerned about others because then we don't have to worry
about looking at ourselves. And then when we are in a time of crisis, someone
else's life can flash before our eyes.

        "There are only so many stories," says "Esquire" magazine film
critic David Thomson, commenting on the suggestion that the new Jim
Carrey picture, "The Truman Show," acclaimed for its striking
originality, had an unackowledged antecedent in a 1968 dark comedy
called "The Secret Cinema." 
        Paul Bartel, the writer and director of "Secret Cinema" (and
of "Eating Raoul" 15 years later) said he has "heard nothing to
indicate that the creators of 'The Truman Show' knew of my film or
were influenced by it in any way."
        And "Truman Show" screenwriter Andrew Niccol, in a statement
issued through Paramount, the studio distributing the film, said he
hadn't heard of 'The Secret Cinema' when he devised the script, and
still has not seen it. For that reason, he had no comments to offer on
any possible similarities.
        Few recent American movies have landed the kind of reviews
that have been lavished up on director Peter Weir's bittersweet satire
about a hapless chump (Jim Carrey) whose entire life has been secretly
filmed and broadcast around the world as "reality infotainment."
Raised from birth in a picture perfect fake town, a huge enclosed
studio set in which all the other citizens are actors working to
perpetuate the deception, Truman spends the second half of the picture
struggling to escape to the real world outside the domed film set..
        Bartel's "Secret Cinema" is a 28 minute, self-described
"underground" film. The protagonist, he says, "is a young woman named
Jane who begins to suspect that her boyfriend and her office
associates are conspiring to make a film of her daily life that is
being shown in a downtown theater on Saturday nights, for the cruel
amusement of the in-crowd. 
        "She assumes at first that she must be suffering from paranoid
delusions. But when she tries to discuss the problem with her shrink,
she discovers that he is in fact the producer of the secret
movie."
        Bartel says he first heard about "The Truman Show" and its
strangely familiar premise "about six months ago, when it must have
been finished already." His initial reaction? "Pleasure, actually. If
it turns out they had seen my film, so much the better. In a sense
their interest in the idea validates my own interest."
        "The similarities [between the two films] are obvious to
anyone who has seen them," says "Daily Variety" film critic Todd
McCarthy, one of the few reviewers to mention Bartel's picture in his
coverage of "Truman." (The Times' Ken Turan was another.) "'Secret
Cinema' played the New York Film Festival at the time." McCarthy
notes, "and it was re-made by Bartel as an episode of the 'Amazing
Stories' TV show in 1986. So it's not exactly obscure."
        In 1969, "Secret Cinema" was released as a short with Woody
Allen's feature comedy "Take the Money and Run." Re-runs of "Amazing
Stories" on the Sci-Fi Channel's have featured the 1986 re-make
episode several times, most recently on May 30, a week ago Saturday.
And Rhino Home Video's cassette release of the 1969 version is still
in active distribution.
        "Still," McCarthy says, "I don't attach huge significance to
the similarity", "because there is no such thing as a totally original
idea."
        Originality, however, is exactly what "The Truman Show" has
been credited with in some quarters. The critical drums began beating
early, when Thomson declared "The Truman Show" "the movie of the
decade" and "one of the most spectacularly original American movies in
years."
        For John Powers, of Vogue, "Truman's" is merely, "the most
widely inventive Hollywood movie this year."
        "Truman" screenwriter Niccol (who also wrote and directed last
year's "Gattaca") seemed to echo that assertion during a interview
broadcast June 4 on the National Public Radio program "Morning
Edition:" Explaining why some Hollywood executives were initially
uncomfortable with his script, Niccol said, "studios like to have
something where there's a precedent, and there really wasn't one for
this film."
        The question of originality in the arts has been endlessly
discussed: whether it can exist at all, and if so to what extent. As
Bartel observes, "Art is all about appropriation and elaboration,
ideas that are taken up and developed in different ways." If art
accurately reflects life, does that make is less original?
Certain ideas seem to lie dormant in popular culture for years, taking
on additional relevance as circumstances in society shift around them.
Bartel's' premise in "The Secret Cinema" may be one of those, an
amusing eccentric notion in its day that has come to seem central in
the new world of mass-media that has since arisen.
        In a recent interview, "Truman Show" director Peter Weir
suggested that the closely watched lives of celebrities like Princess
Diana become a form of reality entertainment. He theorized that people
were shocked at her death partly because "it reminded them that she
was a real person."
        Two other upcoming movies also explore the general subject of
people whose lives become the raw material of TV. The October release
"Pleasantville," written and directed by Gary Ross (the screenwriter
of :Big" and "Dave") depicts teenagers trapped in what seems to be a
TV sitcom of the 1950s. And Ron Howard's "Ed TV," due next year,
concerns an ordinary man who volunteers to have his mundane doings
taped for a program seemingly modeled on the MTV series "Real Life."
        McCarthy noted many other echoes in "Truman Show," as well,
"most obviously of the old Patrick McGoohan TV show 'The Prisoner.'
That was actually the first thing I thought of when I saw that bland
sunny town by the ocean; the resemblance is really quite striking."
        After his review appeared, McCarthy says, he received messages
from readers pointing out other possible antecedents. Obvious
candidates include the Peter Sellers vehicle "Being There," Ira
Levin's novel "The Stepford Wives" and its popular movie adaptation,
the British series of the 1960s "The Prisoner," and Terry Gilliam's
"Brazil."
        John         Powers notes that Niccol is reputed to be an
aficionado of French New Wave films of the 1960s-which raises the
possibility that François Truffaut's "Fahrenheit 451," Jean-Luc
Godard's "Alphaville" and Chris Marker's "La Jetee" (re-made by
Gilliam as "12 Monkeys") might also have shaped "The Truman Show."
        "Not to mention 'Gattaca,'" Powers adds, "which Niccol wrote
and directed. The two films tell basically the same story."
        Several critics have noted a general "Twilight Zone-ish"
quality of the film. McCarthy says one of his correspondents cited a
specific "Zone" episode , "A World of Difference," as a near match for
"Truman." Written by the respected science fiction novelist Richard
Matheson, it was originally broadcast in 1960, eight years before
Bartel made "The Secret Cinema."
        The on-line fan site "The Twilight Zone Directory" summarizes
the episode as follows:
        "A business man [Howard Duff] working in his office turns to
see that his once solid, four walled office is a movie set. The people
on the set tell him he's an actor, and that he's only playing a
business man. He rushes to the place he remembers as his home, but
there's no trace of it. He returns to the studio to find that the
office set is about to be struck. He pleads to the heavens to return
him to his 'reality.' He finds that the walls are now real, and
everything has returned to 'normality.'"
        According to Marc Zicree, author of the book "The Twilight
Zone Companion," this was one of many episodes of the show whose theme
was "that our life is not what we think it is, that it is an illusion
being foisted on us." And while many viewers assume that the business
man's world is the bedrock reality of that episode, Zicree says writer
Matheson thought otherwise: "His viewpoint was that the guy is an
actor whose delusion is that he really is what he is portraying."
        Zicree cites an even earlier treatment of the theme, a 1941
Robert Heinlein short story called "They," "about a guy who claims
that his wife and everyone else in his life is an actor, and that for
instance when he flies to New York there's no city there until they
build it."
        Perhaps the question finally is, where does the organic
process of theme and variation end, and something that might be called
a rip-off begin? 
        Paul Bartel, for instance, contends that the tone and the plot
details of "The Secret Cinema," are very different from those of "The
Truman Show." The new film is an ambitious comic satire of
international mass media, while "my approach was very personal, very
microcosmic. It's really an allegory for the way a lot of us sometimes
feel, that somehow we're the only people who don't get the joke, that
other people know things we don't know and are snickering at us."
        But in "The Truman Show," too, the creepiness of what's been
inflicted upon the hero only fully comes home to him, and to us, as
the people he feels closest to, his supposed wife and best friend,
even his "mother," are exposed as actor-conspirators. Several critics
have singled out a chilling scene in which Truman's ersatz buddy,
played by an actor played by Noah Emmerich, pledges his loyalty to
Truman in seemingly heartfelt terms-although he's repeating word for
word lines that are being whispered to him, through a tiny ear phone,
by the remote "creator" (Ed Harris) of this back-lot universe.
        "The element of 'everybody knows but him' might be somewhat
close to my film," Bartel admits.
        For Vogue's Powers, "The originality of 'The Truman Show'
isn't just in the premise. It's also in where they go with the basic
idea, in the style of shooting it, in the use of lots of different
formats and angles, all the elaboration of the detail."
        Although he is quoted prominently in ads for the film, Powers'
notes that his "Truman" review was not overwhelmingly positive.
"There's no feeling in the film," he says. "It's very, very clever,
but there's no heart in it. Once you've established that town and how
awful it is, there's no reason or earth why anyone would want to stay
there, so there's no conflict within the character."
        Once ideas are in wide circulation,  Powers suggests, they
tend to take on a life of their own: "A lot of this has become the
common currency of so-called post-modernism. Once you have the plays
of Luigi Pirandello and Tom Stoppard's 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead,' there are already ideas in the air that could have
generated this movie, without reference to possible specific
antecdents. The question of what would be really original in a case
like this becomes very complicated."

>From the moment he signed his name on the dotted line, _The_Truman_Show_
has been touted as Jim Carrey's big dramatic breakthrough (never mind that
he won numerous critical kudos for his work in the Emmy-nominated TV movie
_Doing_Time_on_Maple_Drive_).  Carrey indeed does a fine job in Peter
Weir's clever fantasy, but to focus all attention on his refreshing
change-of-pace turn is to discount the superior accomplishment of those
behind the scenes--and to give Carrey a bit _too_much_ credit.
Carrey's Truman Burbank has a nice house, white picket fence and all, in
the idyllic oceanside community of Seahaven; a loyal wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney); an even more loyal best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich); and a
cushy desk job.  If it sounds like a pretty picture from the TV screen,
that's because it is.  Unbeknownst to Truman, the entire life he has lived
is mere programming for a 24-hour television network.  Seahaven is one
large soundstage, where all events are scripted and all the inhabitants are
actors--that is, except for Truman, who was adopted as an infant by the
Omnicam Corporation, and has had every step of his life traced and molded
by _The_Truman_Show_'s creator, Christof (Ed Harris).
In addition to having an inventive plot hook, Andrew Niccol's screenplay
is expertly structured.  In its first minute, the basic outline of the
complex premise is made perfectly clear through a faux television credit
roll and soundbites from Meryl, Marlon (or, rather, the actors who play
them), and Christof.  For about the next hour, Niccol and Weir thrust the
audience directly into Truman's world, allowing them to experience for
themselves the surreal, synthetic way of "life" in Seahaven before going
into a more detailed backstory that fills in the few holes.  In the
process, the viewer is given a much more vivid and entertaining picture of
Truman's situation.
Truman is not as dumb as Christof or other crew members think, and he
begins to catch on to the grand charade that is his life when no one will
let him leave town.  The resulting conflict, within himself and with
everyone and everything around him, provides Carrey ample opportunity to
stretch while staying within comfortable acting bounds.  He gets to cry
(and convincingly at that) onscreen and play a fairly earnest character as
a whole, but he does make concessions to his core comedic audience.  When
Truman's suspicions grow, the more unhinged he gets, setting the stage for
some funny rubberfaced antics (no butt-talking, though--thankfully).
However, his performance is not the Oscar-baiting tour-de-force that a
number of sources would lead you to believe.  Carrey's shortcoming is most
clearly brought to light in one key subplot.  Although he likes Meryl, the
love of his life is Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), a fetching young woman whom
he barely knew in college.  Like the rest, Sylvia was an actress playing a
part, but when she broke script and actually fell for him, she was hastily
removed from the Seahaven set and the _Truman_ cast.  Truman was told that
she and her "father" moved to Fiji, and it's his longing for her that makes
him want to leave town.  This thread is supposed to be _Truman_'s emotional
hook, but it doesn't quite work for a couple of reasons.  The character of
Sylvia, who goes on to be the leader of the "Free Truman" movement, is
sketchily written, as are the reasons behind her deep feelings for Truman;
and, as evidenced in _Liar_Liar_, Carrey just isn't that convincing when it
comes to sentiment.  Granted, _Truman_ is nowhere near as sappy as that
film (not to mention the sap felt out of place there), but, while he is a
likable presence, Carrey doesn't have much of a natural emotional rapport
with the audience or, for that matter, his co-stars.  As such, one may
empathize with Truman's desire to break free, but not necessarily feel for
the romantic plight that motivates that desire.
Hence, the bravura work on display in _The_Truman_Show_ is that of Niccol
and Weir, who have crafted a subtly layered, perceptive, and pointedly
truthful commentary on the media and its and our own voyeuristic
tendencies.  While the ostensible villains of _The_Truman_Show_ are
Christof and his crew, coming off every bit as guilty is the viewing
audience, which is shown eating up every second of Truman's pre-packaged
"life" as their own lives idly waste away.  As outlandish as the entire
premise may seem, isn't _The_Truman_Show_ (in which one's life is
completely exploited as an entertainment "escape" for others) but just one
logical, merging step away from the current likes of _Jerry_Springer_'s
ongoing parade of dysfunction and those real-life "caught on tape" video
shows?

I sat in the theater, watching The Truman Show, and I was entertained. It was
smart, very original, a bit thought provoking, sensible, smooth and fun. But
then, a scene..which caused me to sit forward, hands in front of my mouth, in
almost deer-in-headlights astonishment. Suddenly the slight incoherency of
the early parts of this movie made sense, it reminded me of looking at a
Monet..you look at it up close, and it looks nice, but when you step back,
and look at the big picture..the view is truly amazing. This is another
review that was a bit hard to write, not because I wasn't sure what to write,
or if I liked, or disliked it, but rather, I had..have so many thoughts
running through my head regarding this movie, that I could probably create my
own forum from it. It is that kind of movie..makes you tilt your head, like
that RCA dog. Unfortunately, trends have shown that summer movies tend to be
the cinematic equivalent of Chinese food, quickly filling, then forgotten.
However another one of my gauges for a good movie, is if you are talking
about after you leave the theater..does it get inside you, stay with you. The
last few movies to do that for me were Good Will Hunting, Sleepers, and my
favorite..(and still underrated and underappreciated)..Usual Suspects. I have
had so many thoughts regarding all of the different levels that this movie is
on, the in-jokes, the commentary, the emotion, the undertones..so much
happening here, that it very easily could've spun out of control. But Peter
Weir corralled his movie, just as he has Carrey's trademark manic antics, and
keeps the movie flowing evenly. Carrey is effective in his role, by far his
best yet (of course, that isn't really saying too much, kind of like trying
pick a GOOD piece of liver)..but he is good. He is not stifled however, Weir
obviously knows the talent of Carrey, and lets him loose, a few times, for
his comic nature. The difference in that this time, is that it looks natural,
for the first time in a Jim Carrey movie, I felt like I was seeing the real
him..not a character. He was funny, he was sensitive, emotional, running a
gamut of emotions, every one looking sincere. Ed Harris, playing the director
of the show, is magnificent as well (although, if I had to flaw the movie a
tiny bit..he wasn't on screen enough..but then again, when I look back at the
big picture, I can see why). Harris has always had that aura, of gentleness,
with a glint of a dark side hiding in those eyes. He is paternally spooky in
this role, almost seemingly torn between a fatherly bond to Truman, who he's
watched over since birth (a couple of scenes support this emotion)..but also,
he's pure Hollywood, scripting, planning, plotting, and controlling every act
of Truman's life, except Truman himself..then reacting to Truman's actions,
with a calm, controlling manner. As for the other performances, none really
stand out, because of the fact that they are actors, playing actors..and you
never see anything more than the character they are scripted to me. A slight
exception to this is newcomer Natascha McElhone, who plays an unplanned, real
love interest to Truman, but this situation, like every other crisis that
arises..is quickly explained away, and quelled. We see her as a real person
as well. This movie is both intriguing, and dark, funny, but not..and most
disturbing of all, real, and honest. This movie feeds on the public's
fascination with reality based media, showing us how a world reacts to
Truman, just being himself. This is a commentary on what the media has become
today, and what they could be in the future, another step towards an
Orwellian society..more to come probably..
Note to Paramount Marketing Department: One of my criticisms of this movie,
before I had seen it, rested with the studios campaign to market it as a
Carrey- esque comedy, when it is actually far from that..shame on Paramount.
Take a chance, give us some credit, and allow us to like the movie for what
it is..don't deceive the viewers, they line your pockets..be honest, as the
movie is. Do not lure the audience in on the precluse of seeing Ace 3, or
something..and then give them this, granted, there are a few people who will
be pleasantly surprised (example, as I was leaving the theater, someone
stated "That was not what I expected at all...I liked it!) and glad they were
drawn in by the deception, but ultimately, you will taint the films chances,
by not delivering what was expected. Granted, it is good to tease, and not
show all your cards..but there is a great difference between surprise, and
outright deception

The Truman Show (written by Andrew Niccol, directed by Peter Weir, 1998)
I have long waited for Jim Carrey to be perfectly cast, hoping I could
see some glimmer of what other people find entertaining in his rubber
face and foolish antics.  I had thought it would have been as the
Riddler in BATMAN FOREVER, inasmuch as the best actor to play the most
obnoxious of villains should be the most obnoxious of actors. 
Unfortunately, it worked only too well, as the Riddler was easily the
worst part of a film that disaster, a so-called film which probably had
the worst quality per dollar ever.  (And don't tell me BATMAN AND ROBIN,
so low in quality that it does not qualify as a movie.)  I couldn't even
bring myself to enjoy the scenes he had with Nicole Kidman, despite the
fact that Mrs. Cruise reigns supreme as My Favorite Woman.
     But the appealing part of THE TRUMAN SHOW was director Peter Weir,
a director with a soul which makes movies like DEAD POETS SOCIETY and
WITNESS better than they have any right to be.  I can just see studio
executives happily chomping on cigars, declaring, "We'll get Peter
Weir!", because after all, Weir directed Robin Williams in his first
dramatic role, forgetting that Williams by that time had more than
proven that he had something which has hitherto been lacking from
Carrey's work:  talent.
     Furthermore, Esquire's David Thomson had assured us that THE TRUMAN
SHOW was "the movie of the decade".  When David Thomson speaks, I
listen, and assume nine times out of ten that the opposite is true. 
Thomson has the inimitable quality of drowning his reviews in his
intelligence and candor, disguising the fact that he more often than not
cannot tell a good movie from a bad one.  But before one discounts a man
who says THE SEARCHRES is practically John Ford's only good film, that
THE SHINING is Kubrick's only, and that Brian DePalma hates his talent,
one must realize that when David Thomson is right, he is usually very
right.
     In the case of THE TRUMAN SHOW, he is almost right.  Just because
the film is not really the movie of the decade or even the movie of the
year does not mean that it is not an excellent film, for it is.  Flaws
are minor, while design and execution are near perfect.  Weir and
screenwriter Andrew Niccol (who made a similar yet less accomplished
film in last year's underappreciated GATTACA) have crafted a pristine
postmodern fantasy world with only a few holes, which do not become
obvious until consideration later.
     THE TRUMAN SHOW is at least the third film this year about an
elaborate con setup, following Alex Proyas' DARK CITY and David Mamet's
THE SPANISH PRISONER.  (One could argue for PRIMARY COLORS, but there is
little focus on the victims of the political con.)  Proyas' film serves
for a more direct comparison, as both films are about characters in
artificial world of which they become gradually more aware.  Both films
were created by soulful Australian directors (though Niccol hails from
New Zealand).  Both films also have the same failing, which is to say
the ending.  Though THE TRUMAN SHOW does not sink to the sappy humanism
of DARK CITY, the ending is forced, and capped by a line of dialogue for
which there is no need.
     THE TRUMAN SHOW is rightly less sinister than Mamet's film.  While
Mamet takes on the menacing idea that all people are acting and no one
is what they seem, Weir and Niccol show us that the postmodern age is
not necessarily sinister; it just is.  It is less sinister because a
sympathetic face is given to the manipulator:  the always solid Ed
Harris plays Truman's creator, Christof.  And just because THE TRUMAN
SHOW falls short of making a lasting impact on its audience does not
preclude it from being enjoyable.  The ending turns away from a
statement, a statement which the film indicates need be there and then
never provides.  Nonetheless, Weir and Niccol have taken great pleasure
in creating Truman's world, and its imaginative flourishes provide the
film's best moments.
     And what of Jim Carrey?  Though he may be awarded an Academy
nomination, reports of Best Actor have been greatly exaggerated.  Which
is not to say that he is bad, for in this film he is not.  A minor flaw
in the Truman Burbank persona is that though he is supposed to be the
most real figure in an artificial world, he is its most fantastic.  Yet
on most occasions, the Carrey on the screen is actually Truman Burbank.
Occasionally, as in the disastrous last line, he is actually playing Jim
Carrey.  But then again, that may be the point.  The film shirks when it
comes time for an answer, but at least it dares the question:  in the
postmodern world, who can tell the difference?

For about the first 15 minutes of The Truman Show, they don't tell us
what is really going on.  Of course we know already what is really
going on because the massive advertising blitz has given away about
2/3 of the plot.  I think that the opening sequence would have been a
more interesting experience if I had known nothing at all about the
movie.
Although the movie is billed as a comedy, it is more of a serious
drama with subtle comic elements.
The same author who wrote and co-produced The Truman Show, Andrew
Niccol, wrote my favorite movie from last year, "Gattaca", which is a
slightly better movie and is now on video.  Both films are thought
provoking about the path that technology is leading us down.  Both
films view the road to Hell as being paved with good intentions, and
both films celebrate the individual.
This reminds me about how the famous science fiction author Robert
Heinlen wrote about nuclear war and the Cold War in the early 1940's
before they actually occurred.  Really good science fiction warns us
about things that could happen in our lifetime, and The Truman Show
seems plausible although slightly exaggerated.
I give the movie 4 stars not for just great story telling, but for
also making us think about the world we live in.  My only
disappointment is that most of the important plot elements are given
away in the advertising trailer.  But the ending is a surprise and a
satisfying payoff.
I wish that I could say that the story was completely original, but
there was a Twilight Zone show from around 1990 that had the same
basic premise.
This is the best movie Jim Carrey has been in, and by far his best
performance.  This is his first movie since "The Mask" that isn't
completely inane.  I hope that The Truman Show signals a more serious
turn in his career.
"Carrey is a surprisingly good choice to play Truman. We catch
glimpses of his manic comic persona, just to make us comfortable with
his presence in the character, but this is a well-planned performance;
Carrey is on the right note as a guy raised to be liked and likable,
who decides his life requires more risk and hardship. Like the angels
in ``City of Angels,'' he'd like to take his chances. "
John Coffey.

Starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, and Noah Emmerich.
Review by Laurence Mixson (venom8@hotmail.com)
>From Fully Loaded Entertainment Movie Reviews - Website Coming This
July!
When I first saw the ads for The Truman Show, I expected this: a Jim
Carrey comedy, with maybe a little bit of a serious side(I'd heard about
a "total departure" from his normal routine) about a man whose life is
watched by the whole world on TV. Then, I started hearing that the film
was the event of the decade, and the best movie this summer. So I began
to expect maybe something a little more heartfelt, about a character we
all can root for, a la Forrest Gump. So which is The Truman Show? Well,
neither.
Instead, the film is a deeply psychological study of greed and
unchecked appetites; it is something of a message film about what can,
and will, happen if we do not put limitations on our demands for
entertainment.  Certainly, it is Carrey's best effort to date, but it is
more than just a movie; it is like a moral story told with visuals.
Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who was brought into the world as an
unwanted baby, adopted by a corporation, raised in a giant controlled
set, and whose life has been filmed and seen live on national television
since before his birth.  Everything and everyone he sees around him is
fake; the people are actors, his home and the buildings around him are
sets, even the sky is nothing but a matte painting.  There are thousands
of cameras surrounding him, and every shot is controlled and put onto
television by the director, Christof(Harris.) Truman, of course, does
not know that his entire life is fake, for no one has ever told him. He
accepts his life as it is.
Truman lives a comfortable suburban life: nice car, nice house, nice
neighbors, nice wife(Linney). He works as an insurance company
representative, and has a wonderful best friend(Emmerich.)  However, he
longs for more; he wants to get out of Seahaven, his artifical hometown,
and go around the world; more specifically, to Fiji. His high school
crush lives there, he thinks, because he was told that by her father. In
reality, she was merely an extra in high school that he was not supposed
to fall for, and when she tried to tell him that his whole life was
fake, she was written out of the script and forced off the show.
Truman is urged on in his desire to leave not only by a lost love, but
also because he senses that things are not quite right around him. One
day, a spotlight falls out of the sky and onto the street in front of
him. He sees a missing wall in an elevator, and a set being changed
behind it. Extras appear to block his path out of nowhere, and amazing
disasters occur whenever he tries to find out something that Christof
doesn't think he needs to know.
Truman also has personal problems with leaving Seahaven. When he was a
young boy, he saw his father drown while they were sailing in the sea
during a storm. Obviously, it was an actor, and he did not really drown,
it was all in the script.  Yet Truman thinks it actually happened, and
has been terrified of the water ever since. This is not an easy thing to
deal with, because Seahaven is an island. Additionally, subliminal
messages are sent at him to not leave the comfort and safety of his
town; messages on TV say that there is no reason to leave the community
you live in to explore the world; newspaper headlines say things like
EUROPE: WHO NEEDS IT?, and posters in travel offices show airplanes
being struck by lighting with captions like IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.
I began to feel discontentment while watching The Truman Show, and it
continued to rise right up until the end. Not discontentment with the
movie, but with the idea that this man's life is controlled, and how
fake and cruel the reality of that is. Truman is the number-one
celebrity around the world, outside his dome, yet he has no personal
choices in his life, for everything has always been pushed upon him and
decided for him. Even his material possessions are nothing but product
placements, all availabe, of course, in the Truman Catalouge.
The filmmakers went to great length to show the reality of such a show,
including things that could go wrong: actors becoming upset or unstable,
technical problems, and people sneaking onto the set. In my opinion, The
Truman Show is never once not believable. All of this, with one more
small step, could become a reality in the society we live in today.
Think not? Then think about The Real World, one of MTV's most popular
non-music related shows. For over six years, viewers have tuned in to
watch the lives of people they don't know, doing ordinary, everyday
things like them. For most viewers, it is comforting to watch people on
television that they identify with; people that they can relate to and
understand. To take it further, all they would have to do is watch a
person who doesn't know that he is being taped, because this would make
it all the more real. Yet also all the more fake and cruel. And that is
the message that The Truman Show sends loudly, and triumphantly, across
the screen.

     Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of the most popular show in 
the history of television.  For 10,909 days, it has been on the air, 
using 5000 cameras to show every moment in every day of the life of one 
man.  The public loves it -- there are Truman addicts who go to sleep 
with the TV on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't 
miss anything when they're taking a bath.  Every individual in "The 
Truman Show" is an actor with one important exception:  the lead 
character himself.  For, while everyone around Truman is playing a part, 
he is cheerfully ignorant about the truth.  He thinks this is all real, 
and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal 
-- that there's nothing counterfeit about Truman.  One day, however, 
when a former member of the cast sneaks back onto the set with a warning 
for the star, Truman begins to suspect that appearances can be 
deceiving.
     For those who bemoan Hollywood's consistent lack of originality (as 
I frequently do), THE TRUMAN SHOW is a welcome surprise.  Over the 
years, there have been many satires about the power of television, but 
none has taken this route.  Director Peter Weir, whose past credits 
include WITNESS, DEAD POETS SOCIETY, and FEARLESS, has wed this 
cautionary tale about media strength with a surprisingly affecting (if 
somewhat uneven) drama about one man's search for the meaning of life.  
The only thing I wonder is whether something this quirky will be able to 
find a large enough audience to justify the budget.
     Paramount Pictures is clearly using THE TRUMAN SHOW as an example 
of summer counterprogramming.  The movie opens up a scant two weeks 
after GODZILLA and announces its intentions with the first line:  "We're 
tired of pyrotechnics and special effects"  But are we?  More 
importantly, is Jim Carrey's draw strong enough to pack theaters showing 
this movie, especially when his role here is light years away from the 
zany character he usually plays?  And how badly will marketing THE 
TRUMAN SHOW as a comedy hurt the movie when viewers realize that's not 
what it is?  These questions, which lie at the heart of the picture's 
hope for success, will be answered fairly quickly once it is released.
     For Carrey detractors who are easily turned off by the comic's 
rubber-faced antics, THE TRUMAN SHOW proves to be an eye-opener.  Not 
only does Carrey remain rigidly-controlled and reigned in, but it would 
be fair to call his performance both understated and effective.  
Exhibiting the charm and charisma of a Tom Hanks or even a young Jimmy 
Stewart, Carrey develops the sort of likable personae that a movie of 
this sort needs to succeed.  He is ably supported by a cast that 
includes Laura Linney as Truman's TV wife, Natascha McElhone as his one 
true love, Noah Emmerich as his best friend, and Ed Harris as "God," the 
TV program's creator and director.  
     Most movies today run far too long, but THE TRUMAN SHOW is actually 
too short.  A considerable amount of worthwhile material goes 
unexplored.  (For example, one question that is never answered is 
whether Truman actually has sex with his actress-wife.)  I would have 
liked to know something about the personal pressures faced by the actors 
in "The Truman Show" and more about the incredibly complex logistics of 
controlling and filming the entire life of one man.  Narratively, the 
film is a little rough around the edges, as if a lot more was filmed 
than what shows up on-screen, but, although the flow may be off a 
little, it's not difficult to follow what's going on.
     Stylistically, THE TRUMAN SHOW uses an interesting approach, 
intercutting documentary-like interviews and lengthy excerpts from the 
program (these can be identified by the elliptical matte around the 
frame) with "real life" footage of the director and behind-the-scenes 
people.  Weir isn't the first film maker to apply this technique (it's a 
"mockumentary" staple), but he uses it to good effect, and it works well 
in the context of this movie.  As far as overt satire and comedy go, the 
obvious use of product placements gets some of the biggest laughs and 
several of the "fear of travel" posters (designed to keep Truman from 
venturing outside of his created hometown of Seahaven) are hilarious.
     As an intriguing, well-written piece of entertainment and a mild 
social commentary, THE TRUMAN SHOW deserves high marks.  Not everything 
in the film works, and the script isn't perhaps as deep or incisive as 
it would like us to believe, but there's enough here to mark THE TRUMAN 
SHOW as a worthwhile motion picture -- an appealing, offbeat, one-
hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters 
tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world.

     Sometimes the term "high concept" doesn't do a film justice.  Critics
are partly to blame, since we use the term perjoratively to refer to
studios' tendency to mix and match stars or previously successful film
plots to create easy-to-sell, easy-to-digest packages.  That certainly
doesn't describe THE TRUMAN SHOW, though the premise is about as high
concept as they come:  a 29-year-old man named Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)
gradually becomes aware that his entire life has been the subject of a
carefully controlled, 24-hour-a-day documentary/soap opera called "The
Truman Show," the most popular program in television history.  No, there's
nothing easy to digest about THE TRUMAN SHOW, which is exactly what makes
it so brilliant.  Masterfully conceived and executed, as thought-provoking
as it is hilarious, THE TRUMAN SHOW is everything studio film-making
should be but almost never is.
     It would be easy enough to praise the film to the skies simply for
creating its world so seamlessly.  Truman's fictional home-town of
Seahaven is brilliantly created by production designer Dennis Gassner as a
Disneyland-clean approximation of a small Florida community.  Unique
visual perspectives capture the way thousands of cameras pry into every
moment of Truman's life, from inside his car radio to behind his bathroom 
mirror. The film scores may of its best comic hits with running gags
about product placements in the commercial-free show -- Truman's
alarmingly cheery wife Meryl (Laura Linney) bringing home a new kitchen
tool; his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) showing up with a six-pack of
beer any time there's trouble; two men who consistently position Truman
in front of an advertising poster on the street every time they meet.  For
nearly 45 minutes director Peter Weir permits only isolated intrusions
from the "real world" reacions of viewers, wrapping the viewer in the
inescapable "reality" in which Truman lives.
     The emotional content behind that premise makes THE TRUMAN SHOW far
more than a clever exercise in style.  Jim Carrey's performance as Truman
is deceptively complex, because he's playing a character who often behaves
with the forced good nature of a sit-come character.  Behind that facade,
however, is a man with inner life repeatedly thwarted by the "plot" of
"The Truman Show."  His childhood dreams of exploring are re-programmed
with childhood trauma so he'll never want to leave his sound stage
community; his one true love (Natscha McElhone), the extra who tries to
tell him the truth about his life, is yanked away from him, leaving him to
reconstruct her from magazine photos.  Truman is like a child under the
thumb of a domineering parent, which adds depth to the character of
Christof (Ed Harris), the show's creator and director.  In small moments
we see Christof behaving with the concern and tenderness of a father, but
it's a twisted and controlling love.  Though he sincerely believes he has
created a better world for Truman, he can't overcome the determination of
his "son" to create his own destiny.
     Before it begins to appear that THE TRUMAN SHOW is a touch-feely
triumph of the spirit story complete with swelling strings, I should note
that Weir and writer Andrew Niccol (GATTACA) come at the material from a
subversive and satirical angle.  As much as it is about Truman himself,
THE TRUMAN SHOW is also about the phenomenon of television viewership, and
more specifically about the phenomenon of blaming the media for giving
the people what they want.  The irony in the film's conclusion, as Truman
tries to escape from his staged life, comes from the same viewers who
happily watched his confinement cheering for his freedom, seemingly
oblivious to the role they played in his plight.  THE TRUMAN SHOW
recognizes that we are a nation of voyeurs who jeer programmers for
pandering to our voyeuristic nature.  The film's most memorable moment may
be its final scene, where a heroic finale is twisted with a knowing nod to
the fact that there will always be an audience for the next "Truman Show."
If this is the stuff of high concept, then it's the kind which finally
puts the emphasis on the "high."

The Truman Show
1998  Dir: Peter Weir
7/10
 I went into this movie with a lot of expectations.  While I'm not a huge 
fan of Jim Carrey, the premise sounded extremely fascinating, and the 
word of mouth had been glowing.  Sadly, while the Truman Show is 'pretty 
good', it never quite becomes the masterpiece that it was meant to be.
 For those of you tuning in late, the film stars Jim Carrey as Truman 
Burbank, a man whose entire life is really a television show.  His wife, 
his friends, etc. are all actors.  His town is a set.  So on, so on. 
 Eventually he begins to discover what's going on.  
 The problem of the film lies mostly in its tone.  While for the most 
part it is a somewhat serious film, constant bits of humor are thrown in. 
 Sometimes this helps the film, as when we laugh at Truman's life.  But 
other times, such as when we see the reactions of a viewer to Truman's 
stormy sea voyage, it destroys any tension.  This movie doesn't quite 
know what it wants to be.
 The ending truly underscores this fact.  While it would be a marvelous 
ending for a satire about our society and our obsession with television, 
which this movie does court becoming, it doesn't fit the film we have 
seen, which is really about Truman.  The Truman Show could have been a 
brilliant satire about society, or it could have been a moving character 
study/Twilight Zone episode.  Instead, by not choosing a direction, it 
becomes neither and finally settles on pleasant mediocrity.

The beginning to a good movie is a good story, and that was most likely
the way Andrew Niccol began before writing his script to THE TRUMAN
SHOW. Innovative and determined, the story is one of the finer pieces of
literature to make it on to the screen this year; although it does not
contain the meandering plot twists of similar movies such as Dark City,
it contains a great amount of depth which adds to the power of the
story. It's only a base, though, for a series of fine performances and
great photography, music, and editing, all of which will surely make THE
TRUMAN SHOW one of the year's best. 
The movie almost sets itself up as a metaphor for the power of the
effect television as an entertainment medium. The opening credits do not
read 'Jim Carrey' and 'Ed Harris,' they read 'Truman Burbank' (Carrey)
and 'Christof' (Harris). In this way, Director Peter Weir begins to make
us think that what we're watching is actually happening - the first
important step toward engaging an audience. The movie continues through
a brief but explanatory progression of Truman's life: he is the star of
an immensely popular television series that gives hope to millions, but
there's one catch. He's the only principle in the series that does not
know he's in a television series. All of his friends and family, even an
entire town, are a cast of extras. 
Although the show has been following Truman's life since he was born,
we're inserted at Day 10,909 - somewhere near the end of Truman's
twenty-ninth year. The first half of the movie is contained almost
entirely within the show, so that even the audience has very little idea
of what happens outside. But as the story progresses, both Truman and
the audience come to know more and more that something else exists: the
esoteric world of Christof, the creator of the show. The downside to
this is that any audience member without prior knowledge of the setup
will find the opening part to THE TRUMAN SHOW vague, or perhaps
confusing. Great narrative hook that it is, though, even informed
viewers are yearning to see outside the vast soundstage on which the
television show is shot. 
Into the movie's second half, though, that wish is fulfilled and we are
given broader and broader looks at the man behind the scenes.
Masterfully done by Ed Harris, and perhaps a portrayal of Oscar worth
for a supporting role, the man is a guru of entertainment. Dynamic
enough, though, to at the same time be obssessive and even frightening,
he adds weight to what otherwise might be an inspired little melodrama.
The characters and scenes are also underscored by Burkhard Dallwitz's
fine score, and although cinematography is questionable - is it Peter
Biziou, or the crew of THE TRUMAN SHOW that's choosing what we see -
it's no less thematic. All in all a perfectly watchable motion picture.
With the sudden failings of GODZILLA at the box office, THE TRUMAN SHOW
may become the benchmark for the summer movies of 1998.
FINAL AWARD FOR "THE TRUMAN SHOW": 3.0 stars - a good movie.

 The Truman Show is a thought-provoking, original movie that works on many
levels.
 It has you questioning your concepts of reality - and even God.
 The movie can be viewed as a parable on the amount of control we have over
our lives, or as an allegory about the exploitation so rampant in today's
world.
 But what is most amazing about The Truman Show is the performance of Jim
Carrey.
 Linking the words Jim Carrey and drama have been considered an oxymoron.
But in The Truman Show, Carrey gives a breakthrough turn as a man who
slowly comes to realize that his life is really not his own.
 Shucking his familiar manic mannerisms, Carrey is subtle, winsome,
innocent, in control and wise as Truman Burbank, whose life, from the
moment of his birth, has kept television audiences enthralled worldwide.
 Truman lives and works in Seahaven, a perfect little community in which
all the people are friendly and life is a series of product placements.
 But gradually Truman becomes aware that something is amiss. A klieg light
falls from the sky, the same people perform the same tasks on a regular
schedule, an open elevator wall reveals a set filled with technicians.
 Most disturbing is the unexpected reappearance of Truman's father, whom he
believed drowned years earlier in a boating accident. But everyone tries to
convince Truman that the homeless man he saw could not be his father.
 Truman begins questioning the reality of his world and of those in it.
 He tells his friend, Marlon, that sometimes "it feels like the whole world
revolves around me."
 And in a sense, it does. From the outset we, the audience, know that
Truman's world is a fraud, a gigantic set created by Christof, the Godlike
director pulling Truman's strings.
 Christof has designed the ultimate reality-based television show. "We
accept the reality of the world we are presented," he advises his staff
about Truman.
 Later when Truman has discovered the truth, Christof tells him that "in my
world, you have nothing to fear."
 Ed Harris is brilliant as Christof, establishing a character who should be
considered reprehensible and loathsome and making him a figure, if not
worthy of respect than at least understanding.
 Noah Emmerich is fine as Marlon, crying on cue as Christof uses him to try
to distract some of Truman's suspicions.
 Laura Linney as Meryl, Truman's "wife," gives a deft comic turn as an
actress who goes ballistic when Truman begins to ad-lib.
 Director Peter Weir's biblical symbolism may offend some. But it is not
meant to be sacrilegious. Rather it questions the status of God in today's
world.
 Is He, like Christof, that omnipotent director scripting our every action,
or is He merely one of the viewers sitting back and watching as events
unfold?
 Weir's setting and staging of the confrontation between Truman and
Christof is loaded with biblical implications.
 It also is one of the strongest scenes in the film.
 Weir leaves his ending a bit ambiguous, forcing the viewer to think about
Truman's future.
 That's the way smart movies work. They refuse to cater to an audience's
lowest common denominator.
 The Truman Show is a very effective and touching movie. It may leave you
questioning the concept of reality.
 Even if you can't find a hidden message the film will remain an enjoyable
and unforgetable experience.
 At this stage of the movie season, it may be premature to talk about
Academy Award nominations. But don't be surprised come February if The
Truman Show is among the handful of films receiving multiple honors.

Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone,
and Ed Harris
Ingredients: Unsuspecting suburban guy, Hollywood director
Synopsis: 
In the island town of Seahaven, insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey) is a Joe everyman who seems to have everything a typical guy
could reasonably want. He lives in a sunny upper middle class suburb
reminiscent of the idyllic Hollywood version of the late 1950s. He's
married to a pretty nurse named Meryl (Laura Linney). He's got a blue
collar beer buddy named Marlon (Noah Emmerich) whom he has supposedly
been best friends with all his life.  
But there are cracks in this bright, picture perfect, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER
neighborhood. For example, near Truman's home, a pedestrian carrying
flowers, a Volkswagon car, and a person on a bicycle are circling around
the block in an infinite loop. And why, during an argument between
Truman and his wife, does Meryl suddenly pick up a jar of Mocococoa
chocolate and do a product placement ad? One day, from out of a clear
blue sky, a big mysterious Hollywood stage light inexplicably drops and
breaks as Truman is walking down the street. Truman begins to look
closely at things and soon stumbles onto the fact that all is not as it
seems. The result is an excellent comedy/adventure.
Will the slightly paranoid Truman want to escape the perfect and
comfortable illusion of life at Seahaven?
Opinion:
When critics give a movie the highest rating of four stars, folks in my
neighborhood suspect that the film is either overrated, or that someone
paid off the movie critic (in order to jumpstart a stronger opening
weekend for an otherwise lame film). The question is, is THE TRUMAN SHOW
as good as the hype says it is? 
Getting straight to the point: Yes! THE TRUMAN SHOW is well written,
well cast, well performed and excellently filmed. TRUMAN is funny both
in the goofy physical sense, and in terms of inside jokes and sardonic
wit. As a plus, aside from being an engaging adventure, THE TRUMAN SHOW
is relevant to modern issues. The film manages to be funny, touching,
and meaningful at the same time.
THE TRUMAN SHOW is not a Disneyesque kids comedy (small children would
probably not understand it). Rather than playing a hyperactive comedian,
Jim Carrey steals the show with his performance as a sweet ordinary guy
who discovers, with some comic paranoia, the ultimate fakeness of his
world. To his credit (and director Peter Weir's), Carrey never hams it
up or overacts. He keeps it subtle, and as a result, succeeds
brilliantly. For example, Truman tries at various times to communicate
with his wife; she interrupts the conversations to espouse the virtues
of such items as brand name potato peelers and lawn mowers, and; he
looks at her quizzically, his face slowly revealing hilarious,
increasing paranoia.
For TV trivia fans, TRUMAN serves up a fun assortment of inside pop
references. It throws little jibes at 101 DALMATIONS, FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN, the Doublemint Gum twins, and dozens of other little goodies.
Even the names are rife with symbolism: Truman Burbank (true man,
suburb, bank); Meryl (Blond actress); Seahaven (sea, haven). My favorite
is Ed Harris playing the egotistical (he wears a little French beret)
island movie director Christof. This is a parody of contemporary
European artist Christo, who in 1983 surrounded some islands near
Florida with 6.5 million square feet of pink polypropylene.
Finally, THE TRUMAN SHOW offers an intriguing thought. At one point
Truman discovers that TV 'reality' is in fact a doctored creation. We
crack jokes about an American President we've never met; we cry over a
princess we've never met; we exult over the victories of a sports hero
we've never met; we fume over a foreign dictator we've never met. That's
the nature of our own information age reality - -  a reality where
carefully spun and tailored script characters and dramas are felt as
keenly as life at hand, and are accepted as real and normal behavior by
young children.
THE TRUMAN SHOW is a brilliant piece of writing by scriptwriter Andrew
Niccol. I highly recommend this film, and it is probably no exaggeration
to say that THE TRUMAN SHOW is one of the most important movies of the
1990s decade if not the century.

Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of The Truman Show, one of the
most popular TV shows on the planet. People around the world watch
Truman's life as an insurance executive in the coastal town of Seahaven.
Although Truman is a popular member of  the community, he is the only
one who isn't paid to live there - because everyone else is an actor.
Thousands of strategically-placed cameras follow Truman's every move, as
he interacts with hundreds of people who are following the orders of a
TV director, high in the sky.
This massive conspiracy was conceived decades ago, when Truman was
chosen from several unwanted babies. Adopted by a corporation, Truman
became the object of a fantastic experiment to televise an entire life
-- the ultimate reality show. There's no script for Truman, but everyone
else in town has a role to play, while only some have speaking parts.
Others just play "extras," pretending to be about their lives, providing
a natural traffic for Truman's world.
The deception is most cruel in that his wife (Laura Linney), his best
friend (Noah Emmerich), and his parents are not only acting their
affection, but they are subtly steering Truman in his choices. From
childhood, his wanderlust was pooh-poohed by those around him, and the
customized media that he sees is styled to induce fear of travel. As a
teenager, he was attracted to the wrong girl - an "extra." The producers
whisked her (Natascha McElhone) away, so that he would marry Meryl. 
But that incident and others left Truman confused. In a 24-hour
production day, many things could go wrong, and incidents build up. We
see a few overt miscues, and Truman is awakened from his non-questioning
complaisance.  His new awareness and his canny attempt to get to the
truth makes for an exciting story.
This is the perfect role for Jim Carrey, especially at this stage of his
career. His comedy genius has charmed millions of ticket-buyers, but
there is a handsome leading man hiding in there. We know it, but he
is a rare talent, and we don't want to lose him like we lost Spielberg.
The Cable Guy showed us that our fears were well founded, but Truman
provides the perfect vehicle. Carrey is still permitted to amuse us with
little fantasy scenes that Truman has in front of his bathroom mirror. I
doubt that any were scripted.
Delivering this transitional gem is reason enough to praise director
Peter Weir (Witness). The material speaks so clearly that I doubt he had
any trouble reigning in Jim's wild ways. Ed Harris is stuck with the
non-role of Cristof, director of the Truman Show. Dennis Hopper bailed,
and Ed replaced him, but  maybe Dennis had the right idea. The
Uber-director and the constructed dome/studio seemed like plot devices.
Their artificiality was in stark contrast to Carrey's beautifully
natural performance.
Waytogo, Jim!

Not your typical Jim Carrey fare, The Truman Show is a daring
comedy-drama which turns a scathing eye upon the media culture.  Fans
expecting Carrey's usual shtick will be disappointed here...but few else
will be, for this intelligent and invigorating film is a fascinating
look at the struggle between individual spirit and the media culture.
Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of the world's most popular
television show, only he doesn't know it.  As a baby, he was adopted by
a corporation, and ever since, every moment of his life has been
secretly broadcast to billions.
His entire life, the entire world around him, is artificial.  The entire
town of Seahaven, where Truman lives, is in reality one huge set. The
sun, the moon, and even the weather are artificially controlled. Every
person he ever met has been an actor playing a carefully scripted role.
>From his best friend (Noah Emmerich) to his wife (Laura Linney),
everyone is in on the secret but Truman himself.
But this carefully constructed world is starting to unravel for Truman.
Whenever he does something unexpected, such as falling in love with an
extra (Natascha McElhone), the show's godlike director Christof (Ed
Harris) has to scramble to keep reality consistent for his star.  But
little cracks are beginning to show, and the wanderlust-driven Truman
begins to doubt his own reality.
The film is nearly as much about its audience as it is about its title
character.  Even the opening credits are staged as if we were watching
The Truman Show itself (i.e. Starring Truman Burbank as Truman Burbank),
with the actual movie credits saved until the end.  Only occasionally
does the film venture outside the television perspective to show us
either the backstage workings behind the show, or the reactions of the
show's devoted audience.  But in reality, we are the audience who are
captivated by the struggles of a seemingly normal man in a seemingly
normal life.  Truman Burbank is the ultimate celebrity... prepackaged
for our viewing enjoyment, but also a human being fighting the eternal
struggle for freedom.  Entertainment at its best (and worst).
Jim Carrey tackles the best role of his career, and (how's this for a
shocker) he's not playing Jim Carrey, unlike the rest of his virtually
interchangeable frenzied roles.  No, this is a subtle, nuanced Jim
Carrey...and, what do you know...he actually can act!  There were still
one too many "Jim Carrey" moments in the film... bones thrown to the
masses of Jim Carrey fans who, the studio apparently fears, might rebel
if not treated to a glimpse of standard Carrey fare.
The rest of the cast has the unique challenge of playing the part of
actors playing a part.  Emmerich does a good job as the best pal who's
somehow always nearby when Truman needs a friend, but Laura Linney
stiffly overacts her part as Truman's wife.  It's hard to believe Truman
doesn't see through her from the start. One opportunity lost in the film
is to fill in any back story on the other actors.  While it's not
crucial to the film (which is the Truman show after all), it would have
been interesting to see (or simply to hear the actors say in an
interview, for example) the effect of living a 24-hour lie on their own
lives.
Ed Harris does a delightful job as the show's creator/producer. Half
deity, half mad scientist, he can't quite comprehend whyTruman would
even want something besides his artificial ideal existence. It may be a
zoo cage...but it's a really, really nice one.
A couple of times the question comes up, why hasn't Truman detected the
ruse long before?  I believe the answer lies in his upbringing. His
entire life has been a lie, to the extent that he doesn't know the truth
when he sees it. If Truman has never seen a real sunrise, why would he
be disappointed in a spectacularly recreated one?
The film does make a misstep (though one calculated to make Truman more
accessible to the audience) by casting Truman as such a normal guy.  He
should have been used to being subtly pushed and prodded around, and
should have been oblivious the minor inconsistencies that are obvious to
the audience.  But that's a minor nit, and the film doesn't lose much by
portraying Truman as a much more normal man than he should have been.
Multi-faceted, The Truman Show delivers on several levels.  Not only is
it an enjoyable human drama, but also an intriguing look at the excesses
of a celebrity oriented culture and a disturbing look at the future of
entertainment.

You've probably seen the trailers on television, on the theater screens, and
in the magazines and newspapers. Hailed as the "best movie of the summer" as
well as the "movie of the year", it's a story about Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey), a seemingly normal guy living in a scenic coastal town with his
beautiful wife (Laura Linney) and his gang of neighbors and friends, led by
Marlon (Noah Emmerich).
Truman Burbank, for all his normal-ness, is actually the only real-life
character in a huge, fictional television show, directed by the mysterious
Christof (Ed Harris). Morning, day, and night, Truman is filmed from
thousands of different cameras throughout the picturesque town. His house,
his friends, his workplace, his wife, his car, and everything around him are
'bugged' with microscopic cameras which capture every nuance of his actions
which are then broadcast around the world to cheering hordes of 'The Truman
Show' fans. They celebrate his victories, cry with him and his problems, and
emphasize with the way he deals with his day-to-day existence. Truman is
naturally unaware that his life is being witnessed by millions (and possibly
billions) of other people; he is actually unaware that everything
surrounding him is one, huge, scripted soap opera. As Christof tells an
interviewer in the movie, Truman is the only character in the show who is
truly original and spontaneous. Truman has been in this television show
since he was born, and every part of his life: from first steps to his
boating accident with his fictional father to his marriage have been
recorded and broadcasted to the entire world.
In a huge dome outside of Hollywood ("Other than the Great Wall of China,
the only other man made structure visible from outerspace"), Christof
directs the pageant, narrating to the other 'actors' in Truman's life and
selecting dramatic camera angles as well as 'cueing' natural things such as
sunrise, storms, and various interventions when he suspects Truman is
getting too 'close' to unmasking the fabrication.
The plot of the movie involves Truman discovering his 'real' place in his
'life' he lives. It begins with a normal day, with Truman smiling, greeting
his neighbors in a very typical Leave-it-to-Beaver fashion, before getting
in his suburban car and driving to his average job as an insurance salesman.
An unscripted accident happens: a light from the television set falls from
the sky and smashes into his driveway, and although he suspects something, a
quickly-scripted radio broadcast in his car assures 'all the residents' of
the town that nothing is wrong.
The rest of the movie concerns Truman discovering (in sometimes humorous
ways) that his life isn't everything he thinks it is. Convienent 'solutions'
to the facades he accidentally reveals are amusing (especially the obviously
thrown-together Nuclear Power Plant accident), but inevitably cliched and
pretty unbelievable. There's a true deux-ex-machina involved whenever Truman
gets too 'close' and law enforcement officers (or security guards) expel him
from a scene. Of course, this is the nature of the beast, but if Truman
finds it unbelievable, you can count on the audience (err, the theater
audience, not the Truman Show audience..) finding it unbelievable by a
factor of ten. But perhaps that's the charm of the movie.
I suppose in a way I was blinded by the endless advertising claims of The
Truman Show being the "Movie of the Summer" and the "Best of 1998". I
expected a Forrest Gump or a Titanic, instead, I got something more in the
line of Primary Colors or Men In Black. Not mind blowingly awesome, but not
bad, either. I expected Truman's character to completely break free of the
scripted-everyman-in-a-bad-soap-opera role, but instead, he thrives on the
situation and doesn't seem to make any truly original or completely
spontaneous decisions.
The supporting characters are believable, until you find out that they are
mere husks controlled by Christof. Marlon (who reminds me unseemingly of
Biff Tanner from Back to the Future, for some reason) has a few
heartwrenching moments with Truman, which are shatterered when you learn
that he truly is just an actor reciting the words Christof narrates in his
earpiece. Likewise for Truman's wife, who seems to break down 'in scene'
during a tense moment of the film, pleading with the show's directors to
'get Truman off of her', when in retrospect nothing was shown first of her
lack of 'professionalism'. It's just a little bit of a slap-in-the-face for
each of the supporting characters. One day, they are the serious,
role-orientated characters who inhabit The Truman Show, and when Truman
shows the first signs of rebellion, they are suddenly blithering and
confused - even though most of them have supposedly spend 15+ years of their
life around Truman.
I found Truman's fantastical love interest with a two-bit character played
sullenly by Natascha McElhone odd and unfounded. As an extra in the early
parts of the 'show', Truman sees her right before he meets his wife-to-be
and is fixated by her looks and smile. For some reason, she throws away her
(obviously) great paycheck and tries to convince Truman of his real identity
(which is foiled ASAP). Truman then spends the majority of his life trying
to piece together a bizarre (and vaguely serial-killerish) scrap-book like
montage of this one-time dream girl using portions of fashion magazine
photographs. And yet, for some reason, Truman remembers this woman his
entire life and it's the basis for his complete unbelief of everything
surrounding him.
Perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't find Truman's disbelief of
his surroundings too believable, if that makes any sense. The lights falling
from the skies, his discovery of sets and extras not acting correctly and
things of that nature add realism to his disbelief, and I suppose the
director anticipated the theater audience believing that Natascha McElhone's
character is the one thing to piece it all together - but then why the
sudden reappearance of his 20-year dead father? Why the continual defiance
towards the radio explanations, his wife's pleadings, and his best-friend?
It just doesn't add up to a 100% believable situation, which of course is
moot because The Truman Show is about fiction. But still, I felt empty
handed.
I was also disappointed with Christof's character. He turns out to merely be
another power-hungry Television Network Executive, instead of the father
figure/God/conscience voice you first sense he is. Further adding to the
unbelievable complications of the scene, the other
producers/directors/whatever of The Truman Show (err, the Truman Show in the
movie, that is) seem incredibly lax and inattentive. You'd expect for a
billion-audience member, multi-trillion dollar live-production extravaganza
the staff would be 100% sure of whatever Truman was doing at 100% of the
time. People will be people, of course, but the pivotal event which makes
Truman figure out who he really is seems contrived with 'typical
stressed-out producer' syndrome.
I had the opportunity to view the movie with a friend of mine who was truly
unaware about any of the hype surrounding The Truman Show, and to be honest,
he was kind of confused. The opening credits run like the beginning of the
(fictional) Truman Show, and it isn't until halfway through the movie that
you see the much advertised 'interview' with Christof which 'explains' the
concept behind the movie Truman Show (including the hilarious line, "Was
Truman was the first baby adopted by a corporation?"). Perhaps the movie
would be more believable and entertaining if this interview was shown
earlier in the picture, or if you had a few more minutes of Truman
interacting with his surroundings instead of the almost-instant suspicion
you end up viewing. That way, you can view the movie as a harmless observer
instead of trying to figure out what's going on along with Truman.
Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance as Truman, branching out
completely from the semi-slapstick antics of Liar, Liar and removing himself
forever from the laughing stock of Ace Ventura fame. Although at times it's
a comedic performance, you sense that it's more of Truman's humorous
personality than Jim Carrey yukking it up in The Mask or Batman frivolity.
Although rumors persist of a Dumb and Dumber sequel, I can't imagine Jim
Carrey performing as another mindless dolt again.
Ed Harris as Christof retains the serious roles he fashioned in movies such
as The Rock. He's humorless and serious as the money and ratings-hungry
producer/director of The Truman Show, and shows off his devotion to his
creation in the final scenes with more heartwrenching sincerity. The
combination beret/glasses look as well as the close-up shots of his face and
reactions bring a new, dramatic side to the actor which hopefully will be
exploited in his upcoming roles.
The remaining supporting characters are just that: supporting actors in both
the true theater Truman Show and the fictional Truman Show. Neither
outstanding nor average, they simply fill the void of hundreds of extras
which populate the movie. I personally never found Truman's wife too
believable - she seemed far too June Cleaverish and Truman seemed far too
cynical for any love interest to exist. Perhaps this is the source of his
infatuation with Natascha McElhone's role? The same goes for Marlon - he
comes off as completely too blue collarish and too "Let's go drink and
everything will be OK"-ish for white-collar salesman Truman to associate
with him. Of course, we must all keep in mind that Truman's entire life has
been scripted and performed, and certain things just have to be accepted.
On a rating on one to ten, I'd give The Truman Show a seven.

Movies are controlled by their premise, which is what makes The Truman
Show such an amazing piece of celluloid.
Brief explanation.  I recently wrote a bit on Godzilla which loved it
for being bad, because it's a movie reprising really bad (although
ultra-fun) movies.  The old Godzilla movies were essentially just large
pieces of latex shambling through bad plot intersected with dialog. 
Independence Day, by the same people and almost the same concept, wasn't
a good movie because it didn't have that license to ill.  If Godzilla
had a wonderful plot and great acting, I probably would have hated it.
The Truman Show's premise gives it a huge task: create a show within a
movie in which the producer/director
is essentially God.  That places it essentially on the other end of the
spectrum from Godzilla.
This Harrison Begeron meets The Real World is a difficult setup because
the audience is supposed to be analyzing everything, watching Truman's
microcosm from the same lens as the Truman's television audience. 
What's good for the microcosm, is good for the film.  Because of this,
the reverse is true as well, the viewer is analyzing the entire film in
the same light.
Even with that scrutiny, The Truman Show is still excellent.  My first
concern was Jim Carrey.  As someone who has made a career as an
over actor, it's hard to see him carrying a dramatic role.  Particularly
one in movie where the entire plot and action is almost literally
revolving around him with every hidden camera. For the most part, Carrey
does a fine job.  He occasionally drifts off into manic fits, about half
of which seem to fit into the role and the rest just seem weird.
The chief problem isn't Carrey, but the slow rising of the curtain of
his stageworld.  The Truman Show has been airing nonstop for Truman's
entire life, without his knowledge that it is indeed a show.  Yet, in a
matter of two days, enough clues get dropped and enough actors slip in
their roles that he questions his existence.  What the movie lack is
history.  Truman's denial of his stageworld should logically have
spanned months, if not years, instead of weeks.  Only a couple of
episodes from his life really have an impact on the plot, which seems
implausible for movie begging to have an epic history.
With that exception, though, the movie carries through with the premise
with intelligence. Everything from the extras in television show to the
audience watching it around the globe make an environment which draws
the viewer in to ask the question "How will it end?"
Overall:
Carrey's acting is good, but not brilliant.  Fortunately, it doesn't
have to be, because the movie is brilliant.  Hug your favorite Truman
pillow and go see this one.

     There was a time when Australian Peter Weir made strange and
quirky films like THE CARS THAT ATE PARIS, THE PLUMBER, and THE LAST
WAVE.  But Weir lost that level of creativity at some point. His films
were more professional and perhaps more polished, but they were closer
to Hollywood fare.  At most they had just a small whiff of the strange
his earlier films had.  It has been a long time since Weir made a film
as enthralling philosophically as THE TRUMAN SHOW.  Weir looks at the
media and what it is doing to both the viewer and the person under
media scrutiny.  The film also takes a playful look at the relationship
between humanity and God.
     Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) is now thirty and through
his whole life he has been off-camera only in his most private moments.
In some unspecified number of years, in the future people all over the
world tune in to watch THE TRUMAN SHOW and track how his life is
progressing.  As sort of a cross between AN AMERICAN FAMILY and CANDID
CAMERA, "The Truman Show" follows one character through his every day
and even his every move.  Truman has no idea that he is being watched.
If he knew it would spoil the entire project.  And a phenomenal
investment has been put into creating the huge domed studio the size of
a town with cameras everywhere to relay to the world everything that
happens to Truman.
     The whole project is the brainchild of the godlike producer
Christof (Ed Harris).  No effort has been spared to build the
unbelievable domed studio or to ingrain phobias into Truman so that he
is afraid to stray too far from his home.  As part of the latter effort
we see a visit to a travel agent who has decorated her office with
marvelous anti-travel posters.  Christof has programmed nearly
everything that has ever happened to Truman.  Christof has cast the
important people in Truman's life including his supposed parents and
his wife Meryl (Laura Linney of TALES OF THE CITY).  Meryl's
responsibilities include keeping Truman in line and unsuspecting,
delivering charming commercials for sponsors' products placed into
Truman's world, and above all to keep smiling.  But things are getting
a little difficult for Meryl as Christof's production staff gets a
little sloppy: lights fall from a clear sky and supposedly dead
characters from Truman's past find their way back onto the show set.
Truman is starting to get suspicious that there is something not right
about his reality.
     Does Jim Carrey do a good job of playing Truman Burbank?  That is
a very difficult question to answer.  At first brush it would seem not.
Carrey is his usual weird and does his trademarked brand of clowning
around.  Is this the way someone raised on camera with scripted
experience would behave?  Probably not, but it is unclear how he would
behave.  He almost certainly would lean to some form of weird.  Whether
this is one way he could be weird is hard to tell.  The constantly
smiling Laura Linney is at first charming and quickly becomes grating,
but again these are unusual circumstances.  She would not behave like
an actress because this is like almost no acting job has ever been.
She would have to be constantly improvising and be onstage 16 to 24
hours a day, year in and year out.  Her role would have to be her
primary life. Perhaps her little Stepford wife is precisely what would
result.  Rounding out the major characters is Ed Harris as the de facto
god of Truman's world.  Harris takes his role in a quiet understated
manner and does a fine job.
     I would have loved to have seen THE TRUMAN SHOW cold, having no
idea what the film was about. Unfortunately the ads give much too much
away.  There is a slow build to where the viewer is told the
information in the trailer.  Much of the mystery of Andrew Niccol's
script (as complex as his script for GATTACA) is lost.  One of the big
holes, however, is that this is a much less believable story if taken
literally rather than as allegory.  One must believe that there are
thousands of actors in Truman's world who are just waiting months or
years to be cued.  There are probably parts of Truman's town that he
never visits, but the actors have to be prepared if he does.  Fantastic
preparedness must be arranged for contingencies that probably will
never occur.  In addition, the number of cameras needed to produce THE
TRUMAN SHOW must be literally phenomenal.  At one point Christof
estimates that 5000 cameras are used to cover all the places that
Truman might possibly go.  A little back of the envelope calculation
will show that figure has got to be orders of magnitude low without a
fair risk of losing Truman.  The town as shown must be about nine
square miles and then Truman goes off into the woods in the course of
the film.  The logistics of setting up and running this pseudo-town
seem more and more complex the more one thinks about them.  But again,
this is more a religious allegory than a science fiction story to be
taken literally.  Niccol has a lot of fun playing with the various
features of the artificial sky as a recurrent theme in the film, but
also giving the film a sort of medieval cosmology.
     Music is by Burkhart (von) Dallwitz and seems to consist mostly of
easy listening and classical music on a sort of celestial, New Age
theme.  The idea for THE TRUMAN SHOW is one that has been done in
science fiction several times previously.  Then there are ideas
borrowed from other sources like the 60s TV show THE PRISONER.  I would
rate THE TRUMAN SHOW an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.  This is Weir's best film since THE LAST WAVE by a wide
margin.

Truman Burbank is an insurance salesman who lives on a gorgeous, perfect
Florida island, is married to a perky blond wife, and who has never really
left the island he lives on.  He's also the star of a television show
phenomenon, of which he is conspicuously not aware.  As a baby, Truman was
placed inside a giant dome that covers the entire world he knows of, and
has been raised so that every second of his life is monitored by about 5000
cameras living inside his world.  And Truman has no clue that any of this
is fake.
But every now and then, something will happen that hints at some kind of
conspiracy against him.  In one of the film's earliest scenes, Truman
leaves his house, and a tiny sattelite falls from the sky and lands on the
street outside his house.  A scene later, the radio reports that this was
something that went wrong with a satellite in space.  Sometime later,
Truman sees a bum who looks just like his father, who drowned in a boating
accident, but before he can positively identify him, people come out of
nowhere, drag him onto a bus, and leave him behind.  The morning's paper
says that the city is cutting back on the bums allowed to stay in town.
"The Truman Show" is being billed as Jim Carrey's attempt at drama, after
being heralded by the American Public as a star-studded comic actor, in
such flicks as "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," "Dumb and Dumber," and "Liar
Liar," but this kind of thinking is only for people who push actors who do
comedy into a corner with all the others, like Robin Williams and Billy
Crystal, and say "You can do drama, but when you do it, you're doing it as
a crossover."  Little do most of these people realize, these guys started
off as regular actors, doing dramas and comedies and everything else, but
found they could make a living starting out in comedy.  Would Robin
Williams become a star as quick as he did if he just did
Off-Off-Off-Off-Broadway dramas?  Because of this typical fallacy, people
will be thinking of this as "The Film Where Carrey Does Drama," which will
make people shudder and stay away, and others going just to see if he can
pull it off.
This is sad because "The Truman Show" is an incredible film.  Whether
viewed as a drama, a comedy, a kafkaesque nightmare, a satirical take on
American media, or even a highly unsubtle Christ story, "The Truman Show"
works, and its star, Jim Carrey, creates one of the most human characters
to inhibit a film in a while, even if he's been living in a giant, man-made
globe his entire life, and has no idea what lies out there.
The key to this film is an incredibly complex yet simple script by Andrew
Niccol, who just wrote and directed one of '97's most intelligent films,
"Gattaca."  That film was one that was filled with lots of great ideas
which worked well together, and it even showed us the powerful emotions of
one man who is struggling to overcome the odds of society.  "The Truman
Show" works on the same kinds of levels.  But Truman, the star of the
universally broadcasted show which airs for 24 hours every day, is a man
who doesn't know that he is limited in what he wants to do.
In the first scenes, we see Truman doing his daily routine of giving
himself a pep talk in the morning, greeting the neighbors with his
catchphrase ("Good Morning; and if I don't see you later, Good Afternoon,
Good Evening, and Good Night!"), driving to work as he listens to a
relaxing piece by Mozart, buying a paper, and working hard at his job.  He
has a big giant smile, which is something Carrey fans will not be shocked
to see.  But we also see him in quiet reflexion later on, and even doing
something secretive that we discover about later on.  He puts on a facade
just like the rest of us, and when he's not around anyone, is as depressed
as the lot of us.
That's why when he really discovers that his whole life is a sham, it's so
devastating.  It occurs all of a sudden, but it's something that he's been
hinted at his whole life.  We see flashbacks he has (shown on his "Greatest
Hits" tapes, which are sold throughout the world), including one where he
fell for a woman (Natascha McElhone) who was not the actress who was
supposed to be playing the girl he eventually marries (Laura Linney, taking
a break from the strong female roles to play a perky wife), who tries to
tell him that his life is a TV show, but fails.  Instead, she becomes one
of the near misses in his life, a woman he pines for.  How many times has
that happned in your life, where you meet someone you're intrigued by, but
who you lose due to something beyond your control, only to peak your
interest for the rest of your life?
As the film goes on from here, Truman tries to escape from his life, and we
begin to meet the men behind the show, who desperately try to cover up,
using anything they have up their sleeves.  The entire show was created by
a creepy looking man named Christof (no, there's no subtlety here), played
by Ed Harris, who at times touches the image he has created which is blown
up on a giant TV set on the wall of the observational hut which controls
the show, sometimes creating music to go along with the events unfolding
(one of them is actually Philip Glass!).  We see him completely obsessed
with his creation, and trying to control it as much as he can, but having
to sometimes deal with TV executives (one played by Paul Thomas Anderson
regular, Philip Baker Hall), and having a crisis when Truman begins
discovering the truth (also, look for one of the control men played by Paul
Giamatti, who played Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's "Private Parts," and
basically stole the film from him).
People may say that all this doesn't sound like a "drama"...well, it ain't.
 It has a serious point, and has some very dramatic moments, but it's
really a very mature comedy.  The film is hilarious, especially in scenes
where we see self-reflexivity in the actual going-ons in the Truman world. 
For instance, the film is run by product placement, and several times in
the film, a character will pick up a product, the camera will zoom in on
them, and they will talk about how great it is.  Weirdly enough, this
gimmick actually gets funnier as it goes on, since the show's veil of
reality gradually weakens as the film moves on.
The film is not only funny, but incredibly moving.  "Gattaca" was actually
criticized for its lack of human emotion (not by me), but people will be
blown away by how much humanity Niccol puts into his script for "The Truman
Show."  We understand the pain Truman lives in because underneath
everything, he's really a human being, and he has to deal with the same
kind of problems we deal with, even if it is in a much restricted space. 
Truman is not some really weird guy who looks like that guy from "The
Mask."  Instead, he's just an average guy who just happens to be the star
of a TV show which he doesn't know about.  The film deals with the fear
that your entire life is one big sham put on for you, basically because a
person only knows what he knows and not what anyone else knows.  We
experience life as it comes to us, not through anyone else.  I've often had
the fear that everyone I know was placed before me on purpose, that there's
some designated course I'm supposed to follow, and I'm sure that there are
other people who have had this fear.  Kafka had a similar fear.  Of course,
I'm not Kafka and neither are you.
This film deals with that idea, but it also has a bitingly saitirical edge,
that all of this works great as a form of media for the masses.  With shows
like "Cops" and "The Real World" being so popular nowadays, it's not long
before something as crazy as this occurs.  We've seen horrific things about
life shown on "Cops" and those stupid Fox specials ("The World's Greatest
Police Chases Part Nineteen!"), and we've seen people who actually WANT to
be filmed for the entire world to see in half-hour doses on "The Real
World;" it's only time before people say they want a real-life "Truman
Show."
This is because humanity's the most fascinating thing in the world.  We, as
humans, love to view other people doing things.  We don't know why, but we
do.  Voyeurism has been dealt with in movies, most notably in "Rear
Window," but "The Truman Show" takes it to a whole other extreme.  The film
shows people all around the world being brought together, and even relaxed,
by watching Truman live his life.  There's a man shown in a tub who lives
his entire life along with Truman, sleeping along with him, and hanging on
to the curtain when something dire happens to him.  There's a group of
Asian people who try to learn English by watching Truman talk to people. 
And there's even a bar where "The Truman Show" is on all the time, and they
even have a counter which shows how many days the show has been on the air.
While this sounds like a horrible thing to do to a human being, the film
accurately, and deftly shows both sides of the issue.  In one scene, we see
Christof arguing with someone over it, and later on, pointing out all the
great things about the world he's created.  There's pain in the world he's
created, but the world has been tailor-made to suit you, while reality is
everyone for themselves.  It's an interesting point, but the other side
just has better ones.
I mentioned it was also an "unsubtle Christ story."  I was getting there,
but I'm afraid it needs little explanation.  Christof is God, and Truman is
Christ, the martyr for the entire world to feel better by watching him live
his life in a sealed-off world.  For those who doubted, even when we
discover that the guy who created the world is named Christof, there's a
memorable scene where Truman walks on the water, or at least seems to.
The brilliance of this film is how it brings all of these ideas together,
instead of seperating them apart and saying "it can be this, and it can be
this, and it can also be this."  This works with other films, but it
woudn't work with "The Truman Show."  While this may seem to cerebral, it's
nevertheless engrossing, and it manages to not shoot over the audience's
head, but also not shoot below.
Oh, and it stars Jim Carrey, who has been a bit of a guilty pleasure for
me, much in the same way Jerry Lewis is.  But here, he emerges as a real
actor, someone who can play a real character, and who can still put his
personal touches on the performance.  Yes, Carrey is funny, and there are
times when he does some of his usual schtick.  But what he doesn't do is
overact, or underact.  And he doesn't look uncomfortable, straining to keep
his hyperkineticity inside.  I used to kinda like him, but now I respect
him because I've seen him act like a person.  If he keeps this up, he may
become the predecessor to Robin Williams instead of Jerry Lewis.  But
really, who cares if the film starts Jim Carrrey not acting incredibly
hyper?  What you want to watch for is the film itself.  And if you're
really going to talk about Carrey, talk about how his performance fits in
with the rest of the film instead of standing apart from it.

Director: Peter Weir
Screenplay: Andrew Niccol
Australian theatrical release date: September 24
Who would have thought that two of this decade's most fascinating film
concepts have come from the same writer?  And that this writer, who uses
his craft as if he has worked with it for decades, has only these two
films under his belt.  Andrew Niccol wrote and directed 1997's Gattaca,
a scorching and nearly perfect science fiction film that seems to be
becoming science fact.  The Truman Show is equally interesting, but not
as complete or well crafted.  But it's still an excellent film, and
piles better than most mainstream counterparts.  In fact, the only thing
that Truman is missing is firm direction from its own mastermind.
Not that Australian Peter Weir doesn't do a good job, though.   The man
who directed such films as Witness and Gallipoli certainly has much
talent to offer; but Niccol seems eccentric and intelligent enough to
give a greater flair to his material. In that way, The Truman Show is a
little disappointing, but shows no faults that can't be overlooked, and
gives no moments that can't be enjoyed.
Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of his own twenty-four hour
documentary-soap opera.  It's the longest and most popular television
show in history, shot in the world's largest studio, one of only two
man-made structures visible from space.  You see, Truman is unaware of
the thousands of cameras around him, filming every action and every word
in his life.  Ed Harris plays Christof, the show's creator, who is
partly a god, a director and a father.  The women in Truman's life are
his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) and Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) - who
Truman has always considered as the one who got away, as she was forced
to depart the set after attempting to tell Truman that everything around
him was fake.  Marlon (Noah Emmerich) is his best mate, whose answers to
life's problems are found in a six pack.
It would be hard for any director, Niccol or no Niccol, to hide the
fairly significant flaws in the plot fabric - especially since
everything is crammed into a neat little 100-minute package.  The story
board of The Truman Show is just about as demanding as they get, with
turns and developments at every corner, and the fact that it is a show
within a world far too obsessed with mass media hysteria automatically
adds another dimension to the film.
Christof is easily the most intriguing character; a man who treats
Truman with all the care and love of a father but does nothing that
would strip him of a good camera angle.  When Marlon tells Truman that
he "would never lie" to him, the irony of the moment is given upon
Christof's order to fade the television music out.  The whole world is
watching while two best mates express their emotions. Ed Harris gives
Christof a real kick and an impeccable performance, marred only by a few
lines of silly dialogue towards the end, when he tries to persuade those
around him that Truman would be happier inside his comfortable nest
rather than in the real world.  As Internet reviewer Bryan Frazer
stated, "for Truman, the real media-induced nightmare is outside of the
bubble, not inside."
It will come as a relief for many to know that, for the first time in
history, Jim Carrey doesn't play the over-actor. Carrey gives a
carefully subdued performance, allowing him to express his characters
actions with eccentricity but not over-acting, and there's a major
difference between the two.  The over-actor of the film is Laura Linney,
who gives a google-eyed over impersonation of a cheesy sitcom character,
and ends up looking out of place and faintly idiotic.
Not surprisingly, The Truman Show ends with a happy conclusion.  It's
not a complete one, though, since many characters seem to fade out of
existence.  This is perhaps Andrew Nicoll's only error in his
screenplay, as his carefully placed characterizations of the show's
actors seem to vanish into television fuzz.  But it's really Truman's
piece, and as he concludes his soul-searching journey, one can't help
but be emotionally attached to this wonderfully complex yet distinctly
humane character.
More than anything else, Weir seems determined to make his thoughts
about the irony of world's media clear.  As the final moments draw to a
close, we realize that there will always be an audience for the next
Truman Show, and that the people who cheered for his freedom are the
same who supported the show over its many years.  For this fetching
notion to be any more intriguing, inventive or prosperous, it would have
taken its own mastermind to direct it.

Director: Peter Weir
Screenplay: Andrew Niccol
Cinematography: Peter Biziou
In one of the most original and critically acclaimed movies this year,
we have a non-hysterical Jim Carrey in his most thought provoking,
intelligent role to date. This is the way I like Carrey - away from pets
and cable. Peter Weir has mixed a nice cocktail of comedy and drama that
will keep you engrossed throughout the film. The question is whether in
reality, mankind would stoop to this lowest form of entertainment,
watching another man's life fully played out on the TV screen like a
soap opera. It is an obvious invasion of privacy, but highlights our
voyeuristic tendencies and curiosity about the private lives of others.
If this movie carried a theme, it would be the marked abuse of human
rights. In this claustrophobic world a man called Truman is raised in
front of television, under the scrutiny of the producer/director
Christof (Ed Harris) and the world. Truman does not know that his life
has been recorded on camera since birth, but begins to gravely suspect
the possibilities, when his father returns from the dead, a light prop
drops out of the sky and when he is unable to leave town.
Wonderful aspects include how delightfully this movie is filmed, from a
camera like view. It also highlights how blatant advertising has become,
when products are engineered into a live' television show. However, the
story is probably what makes this movie. It is the journey of one man in
search of himself and the need to discover the meaning of the world
around him. His search for true love and need to explore, drives him to
escape the lunacy of his man-imposed prison. It displays the uniqueness
of the human spirit, where no barriers can stop a man from overcoming
the adverse forces that wish to contain him. It is people like Truman
who dream of walking on the moon, flying to the stars, or in Truman's
case  sailing to Fiji.
A well made movie, wonderfully directed by Peter Weir, ingeniously
written by Andrew Niccol and sensitively portrayed by Jim Carrey.
Certainly an Oscar contender for 1999.

     Jim Carrey's finest hour?  I don't know... I guess if you go for this
sort of thing.
     It's been four years since Tom Hanks played Everyman in FORREST GUMP,
so I suppose the world was ripe for a repeat.  You really can't go wrong
with these Man-against-the-world/triumph-in-the-face-of-overwhelming-odds
films, and done right they can have incredible appeal.
     Thankfully, THE TRUMAN SHOW is done right, mostly.  In case you live
under a rock, you know that this is the story of a man (Carrey) who slowly
discovers his life is a sham, a cradle-to-grave story that's been televised
to the world for 30 years.
     The melodrama factor is high, both on the show and behind the scenes. 
>From Truman's saccharine wife (Linney) to the overbearing director of the
show, Christof (Harris), everyone in the film is a walking cliché.  Part of
this is by design--these are actors playing actors playing real people--but
part of it is a crutch that, in the end, weakens the film.  *Every one* of
the supporting characters is wasted to some degree--it's especially visible
with McElhone's character, an extra that Truman falls in love with against
Christof's master plan.
     It's scenarios like this that give THE TRUMAN SHOW its real weight: The
"what would happen if..." developments that, of course, culminates with,
"What would happen if Truman tried to escape?"  That's where the drama is,
and that's what makes THE TRUMAN SHOW compelling.
     For what it's worth, Carrey's in fine form, but if you're looking for
LIAR, LIAR antics you will be sorely disappointed.  Director Weir has
obviously kept him on a short leash, and while Carrey's improvised scenes
can be spotted here and there, the broad comedy is kept to a bare minimum.
     I can't help but think that with a little more thought to the
supporting characters, THE TRUMAN SHOW would have been a classic.  As it
stands, it's still good, but it just doesn't live up to its own hype.

    If you were to peruse my collection of nearly 300 CDs you'd find
several titles by The Specials, Isaac Hayes, Elvis Costello,
Marvin Gaye , U2 and I imagine the biggest question on your mind would
be: "Do you own EVERYTHING by Prince?"- (nearly)
   If you looked a little further, you'd see that right in between those
were also the greatest hits of The Carpenters, The BeeGees,
Michael Jackson, and Burt Bacharach. I absolutely adore this music, and
not out of a sense of irony, kitsch or trendiness. Before there
was "retro" this was the music that permeated the airwave when I was a
kid and I've never stopped loving it. There is no shame in my
game.
   Now at this point I probably wouldn't let you look too much closer
because you would no doubt stumble upon the CDs I don't beat
my chest over. Discs featuring the song stylings of such luminaries as
Kenny G, Yanni, Celine Dion and...(ugh) Michael Bolton. All I
can say in my defense is: "They belong to my wife."
   I know, I know, the smart thing would've been to keep our collections
separate but...well, she had this Tony!Toni!Tone! CD I really
wanted to absorb- Oh well.
   I imagine your big question now is: "How could you marry a woman with
such awful taste in music?"
    I guess I just...waitaminnit! Is that REALLY you're next question?
Man, you guys are shallow!
    For your information, Oh cynical one', a marriage is based on
mutual trust and having much more in common than something so
trivial as musical tastes. For instance, my wife and I feel the exact
same way about... ...uuuhh...um...uh...Jim Carrey!!
    Yeah, Jim Carrey, hah!
   I was a big fan of Jim Carrey's back before he was on tv in THE DUCK
FACTORY. He was doing stand up comedy which featured
some decent jokes but what was amazing were his impressions- one in
particular. He'd start by tapping his foot and without using his
voice he'd perfectly imitate the cast of MY THREE SONS. Ernie, Chip,
Uncle Charlie and even Fred MacMurray all by unhinging his
jaw and contorting the muscles of his face.
   Nobody was more excited than me when turned up in the cast of IN
LIVING COLOR. Finally, he was given a large enough venue
to show the world how talented he was. And week after week he did. It
eventually led to a hugely successful movie...Ah yes, the
movies.
    When Jim Carrey's film career began he and I had to "part ways".
Though his movies made truckloads of money I found them to
be too broad for my taste- and by broad' I mean: Pretty damn stupid!
(with sugar on it).
   THE MASK was originally a bitingly witty comic book series with a
completely different tone than the flaccid movie adaption. I was
unable to watch anymore than 20 minutes of DUMB & DUMBER. In an
interview Carrey admitted , as I suspected, that ACE
VENTURA 2 had no script. Everyday he'd arrive on the set and say to
himself, "They're paying me$20 million. The cameras are
rolling. Think of something funny! Think of something funny!"
   The only one I was able get any enjoyment out of was BATMAN FOREVER
(in which he stole the show) and that couldn't really be
considered HIS' movie.
    Enter THE CABLE GUY.
    THE CABLE GUY featured a plot with twists, a good script, a message
(despite itself) and some good gags that didn't solely rely on
his unfilled Ridlin prescription. Best of all, Carrey's chaotic energy
was focused into playing a demented character with enough
dimension to remind me of several people I knew in high school. Just as
I'd declared the art of making good comedies dead, THE
CABLE GUY served me up a hot crow sandwich (followed by dessert ala THE
NUTTY PROFESSOR). Me and the missus liked it
even better the second time. It also managed to bring lovers of dark
comedies everywhere over to the Jim Carrey bandwagon. In
short, THE CABLE GUY was successful in every way...except one,
financially.
    Carrey's salary was $20 million while the movie only made $12
million. I'm not strong in math but I think that means it was a flop.
According to entertainment reporters and media analysts, "The fans
thought the movie was too dark! Carrey should forget drama and
return to his old comedy!"   Huh, imagine that. A mandate' that a
performer stick to schtick rather than expand himself as an artist.
Go figger.
    I  researched why this turn of events happened and was able to reach
only one logical conclusion. As it turns out there are two
phylum of Jim Carrey fan: 1) Those who liked THE CABLE GUY and (2)
Morons ... Sorry. Let's say mentally challenged'- and the
ratio was nearly 6 to 1.  Fortunately, Jim Carrey's next movie was
LIAR!LAIAR!. That movie was both stupid' and smart' in the best
possible way. It won back all of his old fans and held on to his new
ones. His career was saved'.
   So, what does any of this have to do with THE TRUMAN SHOW? I'll
explain that in a minute.
   There's no need for me to tell you that THE TRUMAN SHOW is good,
you've already heard that at least twenty times or more.
You've probably also heard it compared to FORREST GUMP and that Jim
Carrey does some Oscar-caliber dramatic acting.
    Hmmn...I would definitely say it's a GREAT movie but the other
two?...I don't know.  Rather than FORREST GUMP, the movies I
would shelve it next to would be ROBOCOP, MAN BITES DOG and BRAZIL-
three of the best written, well constructed, disturbing
and nauseatingly cynical movies I've ever seen.
    THE TRUMAN SHOW is the story of Truman Burbank, who at age 30 has
not realized that his entire life has been broadcasted as a
tv show. His entire environment is a city-sized, dome- shaped tv studio
and all of his friends and loved ones are actors- who stop ever
so often to hawk the sponsors products.
    While this all handled light-heartedly at first, as the story
continues you find out more things that don't sit so well;  Like the
fact that
Truman was actually adopted by a corporation from an unwed mother. They
used intense trauma and manipulation to keep him from
wanting to leave his hometown'. Truman doesn't catch on that his world
is artificial because, frankly, he's never had anything to
compare it to. The worst thing about all of this is that the citizenry
approve of it, not because it's a tv show...but because IT'S THE
MOST POPULAR TV SHOW IN AMERICA!!
    Like the three movies I mentioned earlier, I couldn't help but
respect THE TRUMAN SHOW, despite feeling ill from the cynical
distopia it presented.  After the denial wore off I had to accept that
it WAS our world, and closer than you think. I would refer you to
the new trend in websites: A camera continously broadcasts the actions,
no matter how mundane, of the site's host. Better still, look to
Fox's POLICE SCARIEST CAR CHASES or the highly rated JERRY SPRINGER,
especially before it became faux-fight night. Our
voyeurism is out of the closet and is successfully integrating itself to
our desire to be entertained.
    Exiting the movie I was reminded of how I felt the first time I saw
Chuck Heston come upon the half buried Statue of Liberty in
PLANET OF THE APES or discover that SOYLENT GREEN was made of people.
    Just as lightning struck and knocked a rack of chemicals onto police
scientist Barry Allen and transformed him into the fastest man
alive, The Flash!, in a similar phenomenon, DEAD POETS SOCIETY director
Peter Weir turned hyperactive, gonzo comedian
Robin Williams into an Oscar nominated (eventually winning) dramatic
actor.
    I'm sure you also know that a few months later, an identical
accident turned Barry's nephew Wally into Kid Flash, with the same
powers.  THE TRUMAN SHOW is also directed by Peter Weir and it's star,
hyperactive, gonzo comedian is...well, not quite Kid Flash.
    Carrey's acting is definitely good, but he plays Truman as something
of a 1950's goofball. It fits the story well and is very effective
at keeping you off balance but it doesn't define his dramatic range at
all. For that the best barometer still is DOING TIME ON MAPLE
DRIVE.
   If you've been paying attention you should have several questions on
your mind right now: "What's gonna happen when the old fans
and parents take their kids to see this movie?"  "Dramatic and dark?
Didn't they learn from THE CABLE GUY?"  "How can this
movie succeed?"....Thank you. Now, these are good questions.
   Consider this: The movies I review I usually see 3 days to 2 weeks
before their release date. THE TRUMAN SHOW I saw 2
MONTHS AGO and I'd been reading reviews a whole month before...alot of
reviews!
    This studio isn't stupid. They've learned from the past and are
insuring that there's enough good word of mouth to make the
populace like' the picture before they even see it. Maybe the method
isn't as crass or over-inflated as those used to hype GODZILLA,
but  it's still pure marketing and manipulation and I, for one,  refuse
to be a part of it...
....Well, okay, maybe this once...
....I honestly do think it's a Must-See movie...
....It's possibly the best movie you'll see this summer...and I realize
that ain't saying much, but THE TRUMAN SHOW does...
...It speaks volumes

As Jim Carrey's career moves forward, we are reminded that under the
rubber face of a stellar comedian is a man with the potential of being a
great actor.  Surely, Carrey has a long road ahead of him to prove he
has the endurance of Robin Williams, who began his career much in the
same way that Carrey did and is presently celebrating his career
achievements with an Oscar.  It will be interesting to see where Carrey
is in 10 years.  Definitely a bankable star, Carrey went for but fell
just short of the record for having five consecutive films earn 100
million dollars or more, domestically, at the box office.  'Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective' (1994), 'The Mask' (1994), 'Dumb and Dumber' (1994), and
'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' (1995) all made more than 100 million
but Carrey's disappointing romp in 'The Cable Guy' (1996) snapped the
streak he was going for.  In case you're wondering, the record belongs
to Tom Cruise, whose five consecutive 100 million dollar efforts are 'A
Few Good Men' (1992), 'The Firm' (1993), 'Interview With the Vampire'
(1994), 'Mission Impossible' (1996), and 'Jerry Maguire' (1996).  A
recent analysis of the movie industry reveals that Cruise is actually
3rd among active box office stars for total money grossed worldwide.
2nd is Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford is #1.
Meet Truman Burbank.  He's the first person to ever be legally adopted
by a corporation.  The reason:  to put his whole life on television for
the entertainment of a global audience, 24 hours a day, and without
commercial interruption.  As 'The Truman Show' begins, Truman (Jim
Carrey) is a happy go-lucky fellow, well into his thirties who lives in
the virtual reality town of Seahaven where some 5,000 hidden cameras
operate to capture the events that unfold in Truman's life.  Actually
and as described as virtual reality, Truman's world in the small town is
actually a giant television studio, the largest ever constructed, behind
the "HOLLYWOOD" sign and along with the Great Wall of China, is the only
man made object visible from outer space.  Truman's wife (Laura Linney)
and his best friend (Noah Emmerich) are actors and the town's population
are extras for the staging of the entire television production under the
control of a well meaning but misguided producer named Christof (Ed
Harris).
Truman's life is kept well under control and the film is convincing in
its explanation of why Truman has never left Seahaven, even for a
vacation.  He longs for his first true love (Natascha McElhone) who left
him earlier in his life when she was about to reveal the truth about
Truman's life as a t.v. show and the studio set up in general and she
was pulled from the production by Christof.  Even more convincing and
cleverly executed by the film makers is the way that Truman begins to
learn the truth about his life and how he has been deceived.  Little by
little and slowly but surely, he begins to discover elements that lead
him to believe that something isn't quite right with his life and he is
determined to seek out the truth.  Easier said than done as Christof
keeps him locked in the studio as his attempts to leave are usually
compounded with a weather storm, available by remote control or a road
block accompanied by some story of disaster such as a forest fire or
contamination spill, preventing Truman from leaving.
As described in 1976's 'Network' by news anchor turned tabloid prophet
Howard Beale (Peter Finch), television is in the "boredom killing"
business in which each scenario must be packaged into a neat 30 or 60
minute time slot.  'The Truman Show' elevates that theory as Truman
Burbank's life is real and the purpose of television is inverted in his
case and messages about the big brother syndrome are also well displayed
as a metaphor and the film's most important quality is the message of
how the human spirit will not be contained by anyone or for anyone.
Writer Andrew Niccol has penned an entertaining, evenly constructed and
strikingly original screenplay which is among the most interesting seen
so far in the 90's and director Peter Weir is the perfect man to have
made 'The Truman Show'.  His previous films such as 'Gallipoli' (1981),
'The Year of Living Dangerously' (1983), 'Witness' (1985), and 'Dead
Poet's Society' (1989), are all examples of how films can entertain
without injecting any elements of the usual Hollywood endings which are
often pretentious, a cop out or just downright unbelievable.  'The
Truman Show' will leave you wondering what is more important:  one man's
life living in Utopia or the challenge of living life with all of its
hurdles?  It's an interesting question not often asked by Hollywood in
such an original or thought provoking manner.

        I don't know how many other people have had the idea cross 
their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched 
by another world of people, but it's something I used to wonder about 
when I was younger. I can't decide if I first thought it because I 
watched a lot of TV or because my brother hit me in the head with a 
baseball bat, but I'm pretty sure Andrew Niccol, screenwriter for THE 
TRUMAN SHOW, has had the same curious thought.
        THE TRUMAN SHOW is about a man (Jim Carrey) whose 
entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the 
public. Since birth, he's been living in the fictional island town of 
Seahaven, Fla., which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond 
the Hollywood sign. All the people in Truman Burbank's life are 
actors, and the anonymous townfolk paid extras. People watch 
Truman's life 24 hours a day, live, with no commercial interruptions. 
Revenue comes instead from product placement, a staple of 
contemporary Hollywood, with Truman's friends and relatives 
describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones. 
The sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else.
        Even if you haven't seen THE TRUMAN SHOW, you've probably 
learned most of the crucial details from the commercials, the trailer 
and other promotion blitzes. If anything I've written so far is a surprise 
to you, then I pity you for making me a primary source for your 
entertainment news. Either way, you should probably know the 
premise of THE TRUMAN SHOW going into it, because otherwise you'll 
probably think it sucks. It begins with Jim Carrey looking into a 
mirror, reciting the crucial "eat me" scene from ALIVE, wishing his 
neighbors a good day, afternoon and evening, and living in domestic 
bliss with his wife (Laura Linney).
        But weird things start happening. A stage light comes falling 
out of the sky, Truman hears people tracking his movements on the 
radio and he swears he sees his dead father. We learn through a 
flashback that his father drowned when Truman was a child, sailing 
through a rainstorm. The death was staged by director Christof (Ed 
Harris), who wanted to put a fear of water into Truman to keep him 
from leaving the island.
        Similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon 
the truth, not the least of them Truman's best friend Marlon (Noah 
Emmerich), who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the 
last thing he'd ever do is hurt him. As Truman's trusting eyes tear 
over, Christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide 
audience of people who apparently never watch anything else. There's 
even a daily behind-the-scenes update from Harry Shearer that 
captures the highlights of Truman's existence.
        The key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance 
between humor and drama, because a premise like this has its obvious 
implications in both directions. And it all hinges on Carrey, who has 
to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find 
out what the hell is going on. He's come a long way from talking butt 
cheeks in ACE VENTURA. Most fundamentally, it's just plain interesting 
to follow along as director Peter Weir shows us just how they can 
capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they 
coordinate extras, hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors.
        The most interesting thing about THE TRUMAN SHOW is that 
most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a 
show like this. Sure, the most interesting TV genre of the '90s has 
been reality programming and Jerry Springer's popularity is through 
the roof, but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their 
intimate details over to the airwaves. And when news shows use 
hidden cameras, it's done in the name of the greater good, not 
entertainment. But merge the two and you've got THE TRUMAN SHOW.
        Right now, it's implausible -- I mean, the FCC won't let you 
say the s-word on the air; do you think they'd let you broadcast every 
detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent? One day, 
though, it could happen. And, even though it would mean the end of 
privacy, people would eat it up. You know they would.

I don't say this about many movies, but I am really hoping there's a
sequel to The Truman Show.  The concept of the movie (in case you missed
the commercials and the trailers) is that Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is
the star of the world's most popular TV show -- where his whole entire
life is being filmed and broadcast worldwide to a slack-jawed group of
voyeurs, 24 hours a day, around the clock.  At the end of the movie -- I
promise you, I'm not giving away any plot points -- Truman reaches the
end of the impossibly gigantic soundstage and leaves forever.
And wouldn't that be a cool sequel?  You have this man who has been
trapped in a 1950's sitcom hell for his whole entire life.  He escapes
to find that he's monumentally popular, but with no idea whatsoever how
to function in normal life.  Hey, it might not be that great, but it
would probably be better than The Truman Show.
The heart of The Truman Show is the show-within-a-show that's broadcast
via satellite on one of those 500 channels we're all supposed to have
one day.  We see a lot of the TV show in the movie.  In fact, great big
chunks of the movie appear in what might be called Trumanvision -- from
hidden cameras placed in odd or oblique places.  (Would they really need
a camera in the back of a vending machine?)  Truman Burbank is an
insurance salesman (we never see him do a lick of work, though) who
lives a thouroughly hum-drum, drab and normal life on an island off the
Florida coast which he can never leave.  The most colorful thing about
him is his clothes -- tweed jackets worn over sweaters worn over
brightly colored striped shirts, with odd-looking plaid casual wear --
all presumably available for purchase in the Truman Show catalogue.
The mantra of sitcom creation is that your characters have to be
likeable.  I don't myself agree with this approach -- see Seinfeld and
the better British comedies for examples -- but its the path that the
creators of The Truman Show have taken.  Truman is utterly, totally,
likeable in every way, and it's just disgusting.  You'd think that with
Carrey playing the role of Truman, there's be some satiric comic edge to
the character -- but there just isn't for most of the movie.  There just
doesn't seem to be enough comedy or drama in the script to sustain the
TV show as entertainment.  We see people around the world caught up in
the show -- there's even a theme bar for some reason -- but with no
understanding of how or why anyone would be able to watch the show.  And
because the TV show takes up so much of the movie's running length, the
movie ends up being flat and unentertaining as well.
The Truman Show, like any poorly-written TV-show, suffers from what
might be called Jessica Fletcher's Disease.  Anyone who's watched
Murder, She Wrote can tell you about this evil sickness:  there'll be a
point in the plot where the murderer is supposedly unmasked, and Angela
Lansbury will say, "Well, there's still something bothering me."  What's
bothering her, of course, is that there's still twenty minutes left to
the end of the show.  Just as Murder, She Wrote must end with the
murderer being caught, The Truman Show must end with Truman figuring out
his predicament and escaping.  Which it does, but it takes forever, and
there isn't much of anything along the way to compensate for the long,
drawn out ending.
You want comedy?  Well, outside of Truman's wardrobe, there isn't much
of that.  Carrey has a couple of moments where he's loopily staring into
the hidden camera behind his bathroom mirror, and he has a frenzied
escape-attempt scene that looks like it was penciled in to showcase his
manic style briefly.  Laura Linney plays Truman's wife, Meryl, whose
frozen-faced features highlight her role as part-time wife, part-time
infomercial hostess:  she's funny, if you think annoying is funny.
You want drama?  There's a couple of decent dramatic scenes in The
Truman Show, but they don't seem to mesh.  Without giving away plot
points, they come one right on top of the other and involve major
changes in his family structure.  We jump from this to an interview with
Ed Harris, the show's creator, who interjects a long defense of the show
and his place as Truman's protector.  And then we jump back to the
show... which continues as before, with Truman seemingly unaffected by
all the turmoil in his life in the past twelve hours.
If there's no comedy, and little drama, why see The Truman Show?  Maybe
there's a message or something, like there was in writer/producer Andrew
Niccol's previous work, the lifeless genetic fantasy Gattaca.  In
Gattaca, like The Truman Show, Niccol comes up with a great movie
concept but does a lackluster job of fleshing it out and making it
real.  As Gattaca plods on to its inevitable resolution, it leaves us
with a message -- don't discriminate against people based on their
genetic coding.  Fair enough.  The message from The Truman Show is...
what?  It's not nice to imprison people on soundstages and transmit
their lives?
I know there are people out there who loved this movie.  Fine.  I'm glad
you enjoyed it.  Me, I'm waiting for the sequel, and I hope that it's
better than The Truman Show.  It would almost have to be.

Those who have grown accustomed to Jim Carrey as a one-note Johnny
specializing in funny faces and fart jokes might be surprised to see him in
THE TRUMAN SHOW, one of the better films of the past few years, portraying
Truman Burbank, a man who has lived his entire life on national television.
He lives inside the largest studio ever constructed, set up to resemble a
small island town, unaware that everyone around him is an actor and that
cameras are hidden everywhere. "The Truman Show," created by an enigmatic
producer named Christof (Ed Harris), is on the air twenty-four hours a day
and is a worldwide hit. Christof and his actors all seem to hold Truman in
high regard, even as they manipulate and deceive him.
Truman's a nice guy and a bit of a goof, partly because he's been raised in
an idealized, "Leave It To Beaver"-style community. He lives a pleasant,
stable life with his "wife" Meryl (Laura Linney), and has to deal with only
the mild conflicts and difficulties designed by the show's producers. He's
nearing thirty years old, however, and he's starting to wonder what life is
like outside the island, and he still sometimes pines for a strange woman
he met in college who started to tell him a bizarre story when she was
suddenly whisked away by her "father," who claimed she was schizophrenic.
(In fact, she was trying to tell Truman that his life was a television
show.)
"The Truman Show" is television, not reality, and as a result the other
actors sometimes have to pause awkwardly in the middle of dialogue for
product placement, and there is the occasional technical glitch. The show
has remarkably efficient damage control: when a stage light falls from the
sky and lands outside Truman's house, for example, he hears a radio report
shortly afterward that a malfunctioning airplane had just flown overhead
and shed a few parts. But now that he's starting to question his place in
the world, these things are starting to bother him a little more. He starts
taking a few risks, like jumping out in the middle of albeit slow traffic
and finds that, lo and behold, all the cars instantly stop to let him
through. His attempts to leave the island are continually thwarted through
various "coincidences." He's beginning to think that there is some sort of
secrecy or conspiracy surrounding him, and, of course, he's right.
Most of Andrew Niccol's screenplay focuses on Truman's gradual realization
that things aren't what they seem and Christof's increasingly desperate
attempts to keep him convinced of the deception. Carrey turns in an
excellent performance, convincingly capturing both Truman's initial
golly-gee-whiz naivete and his nervous insistence on knowing the truth,
while never losing sight of the character's essential charm and niceness.
There is perhaps one instance of a hastily executed plot development, but
other than that, the screenplay flows nicely, and director Peter Weir does
a particularly good job of finding the right mix of irony and genuine
empathy for Truman's scripted emotional moments.
But what really makes THE TRUMAN SHOW work is all the side issues raised by
the screenplay. At one level, it's a satire of television, in that the
viewers and producers talk about Truman as if he really were nothing more
than a character in a TV show, and some of his little daily problems are
the artificial, contrived stuff of soap operas. It can also be read as a
shot at the current fad of "reality" programming that has brought us the
likes of "World's Scariest Police Chases" and "When Animals Attack."
Equally interesting, however, is the issue of how we simply accept the
reality into which we are born. There are times when I found myself
wondering why Truman didn't start getting suspicious earlier, but the small
bits of weirdness like the supposed crumbling airplane may well just be
part of everyday life as far as he's concerned. Niccol's screenplay also
addresses the human rights aspect rather well. He allows Christof to argue
that it is the outside world with all its violence and unrest that is sick
and twisted rather than his scheme to keep Truman in the studio and on
camera, yet still ultimately sides with the small "Free Truman" movement
that seems to have sprung up.
Simply put, THE TRUMAN SHOW has everything that makes for an excellent
film: an engaging lead performance, a screenplay with solid
characterization and plotting and interesting subtexts, and controlled
direction that adds to the personality of the film without getting in the
way. Some of the buzz surrounding the film has labeled THE TRUMAN SHOW as
the Movie of the Decade. I don't know if I'd go that far, but as of
mid-June 1998, it's at least the Movie of the Year.

Plot: Truman Burbank leads an ordinary untroubled life as an insurance 
salesman and a married man. Unaware of it the entire town he lives in is 
an artificial construct, everyone around him really being an actor and 
he really the subject of `The Truman Show', a reality tv show that is 
watched by millions where every thing that has happened since he was 
born has been scripted and his every reaction filmed. But a series of 
mishaps - a fallen spotlight, his accidental tuning into a radio channel 
monitoring him, the reappearance of the actor playing his father who was 
killed off - make him begin to suspect the artificiality of his reality. 
He holds a secret longing for an extra that once tried to tell him the 
truth before being caught and makes a concerted attempt to leave the 
town to find her, while the entire cast and crew make every effort to 
stop him.
The Truman Show' was written by New Zealander Andrew Niccol. Niccol 
made an impressive writing/directing debut with last year's Gattaca' 
and continues to impress again here. It is possible in Truman' that 
Niccol may have been inspired by Bernard Tavernier's `La Mort en 
Direct/Deathwatch' (1979) which was set in a future where death was so 
rare that a woman with a rare terminal condition became secretly without 
her knowledge the subject of a tv show. However Niccol's treatment of 
the theme here is remarkable and unique, making for that rarity of a 
film that is wholly original.
The central premise in Truman' is that Jim Carrey makes the discovery 
that his entire life is part of a tv show that is being scripted and 
played out by the people around him for a watching audience of billions. 
One is not spoiling any big surprise by telling this as the film's 
publicity machine makes one aware of this from the start. Half the fun 
in the film comes from its' setting up Carrey's idyllic lifestyle and 
then letting us watching the subtle intrusions the tv show make into the 
familiarity of its reality' - a crowd crossing the street suddenly 
freezing as a feedback whine jams their earpieces; people contriving to 
twist situations so they can stop and conduct product endorsements or 
push Carrey into shot up against advertising billboards; the marvellous 
little excuses that keep getting invented every time something goes 
wrong or Carrey tries to leave the town - there's an hilarious visit to 
a travel agent's office where the background is filled with travel 
posters which instead of offering invitations to sunny destinations 
advertise in the direst tones possible the hazards of travel. The film 
even starts to cleverly play with audience perceptions - what one takes 
to be a standard musical score playing throughout is revealed as being 
played by background musicians; or the moment the hero's best friend 
makes a heartfelt plea "Would I lie to you ?" and the film pulls away to 
reveal this as a scripted line being fed into an earpiece. Most of the 
shots in the film mimic the camera shots of reality tv shows. Even the 
opening credits are for the tv show rather than for the film.
Peter Weir becomes the first director to tone down and actually obtain a 
relatively sane performance out of Jim Carrey. All of Carrey's previous 
films - The Mask' (1994), The Cable Guy' (1996), Liar Liar' (1997) 
and the Ace Ventura' movies - have been founded completely as veritable 
amphitheatres for Carrey's rafter-rattling histrionics. Weir is the 
first director to tone Carrey's irritatingly loud facial gymnastics down 
and allow the story on its own to carry the film. One can't help but 
think a more average-seeming performer might have been better suited to 
the film but still Carrey acquits himself capably upon this occasion - 
although ironically only by failing to dominate the film.
The conceptual audacity of both Gattaca' and Truman' show Niccol as 
one of the most promising young writers around at the moment. Niccol 
indeed has the ability of all good science-fiction writers to construct 
scenarios that are extrapolated from a single What If' premise - how 
would a genetic dropout survive in a world founded on genetic purity ? 
what if a man found his entire life was being staged as a tv show ? - 
and to work the premises to thoroughly logical conclusions. In both 
cases Niccol intriguingly creates heroes whose entire struggles centre 
on having to outwit and subvert an entire social order that is set 
against them A quite remarkable film.

Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who lives in a perfect world with a
perfect job and a perfect wife.  Little does he know that his life is the
center of a 24 hour widely popular television show known as The Truman Show. He
is surrounded by actors in one huge dome studio and is constantly watched by a
variety of cameras, which are hidden throughout the city. 
"The Truman Show" is a creative and enjoyable movie which is wonderfully acted
and directed.  Jim Carrey, known mostly for his rubber faced gags and his
talking rear end, takes a surprising and effective turn to drama as Truman,
similar to how Robin Williams has succeeded in the last decade.  Carrey is so
believable and likeable that you feel shame for his character and cheer him on
during the film.  He also uses humor to his advantage, making The Truman Show
even more entertaining.  
Ed Harris gives one of his best performances, as well, as the creator of The
Truman Show, who is extremely picky about using the right cameras, the right
actors, and the right scenery.  Harris adds a powerful god like appearance to
the movie as his obsession towards the show and Truman's life for over thirty
years makes him a creepy villain unlike the average "bad guy" of current
movies. 
Peter Weir masterfully directs The Truman Show using unordinary camera angles
to emphasize that the cameras are watching Truman no matter where he goes. Weir
also creates a magnificent set from an elaborate city to a sea that never seems
to end. He cleverly displays advertisements in random places and errors of the
show's production ( a studio light falls from the sky) reminding the viewer
that it is live television and some faults will occur.  Throughout the movie he
asks the viewer whether the city should continue to entertain the world or  if
it should halt for the sake of one innocent, unknowing man.  The Truman Show is
not your ordinary movie. Its detailed 1984-ish plot, its powerful acting, and
its phenomenal directing make it one of the
best movies of the 1990's.

I think it was inevitable that some guy in Idaho (or someplace like
that) would dub a film "Movie of the Decade" somewhat before the
millennium.  I'm just surprised no one has declared a "Movie of the
Millennium".  At least you'd have that bit of alliteration.
In any case, our "Movie of the Decade" for this summer is "The Truman
Show".  Jim Carrey is Truman, a man in a fish bowl, unaware that he is
being televised to the world.  The TV series of Truman's life, captured
by thousands of secretive cameras around the movie set/town of Sea
Side, is Bigger Than Seinfeld (if that can be imagined).  He has been
televised, unaware, since before birth (why not conception?), and, in
the show's 30th year, he begins to realize that his world apparently
revolves around him.
This basic plot has been used before.  Relying on the Way Back Machine,
we have the whole Descartes thing: the proof of god's existence comes
from "I think therefore I am", but raises the possibility of a Great
Deceiver, spinning an illusionary world around "I".  Arguably, spin the
Way Back dial a bit farther, and you'd come up with Plato and the Cave,
but Plato didn't mean the Cave in a literal sense, and we were in the
cave because of ourselves rather than some external entity.  Much more
recently, Philip K.  Dick played with this "what is reality" idea in
any number of novels.  There was one novella with a nicely surrealistic
moment: the protagonist, already believing there was something wrong
with the world, buys an ice cream cone, only to see the ice cream
vendor disappear, leaving behind only a slip of paper saying "Ice Cream
Cart".  The novella, however, ends more sinisterly and more
conventionally, with it being revealed that the hero was unknowingly
computing missile trajectories by solving the Sunday newspaper puzzle.
Most closely to "The Truman Show", there was a 1980s Twilight Zone in
which a man's life was the subject of a TV series.  I don't recall how
that episode ended, but I'd like to think that the discovery of the TV
studio was scripted, and that there were infinite layers of TV series
within TV series, Russian Dolls of voyeristic entertainment.
I suppose the main difference is that the narcissism has changed from
god or the devil giving sufficient damn to make up the world for us, to
the planet's television audience giving sufficient damn to watch us
brush our teeth in the morning (though, seeing that we have "America's
Funniest Videos", the Fishing Channel and C-SPAN on cable, as well as
random webcams peering into people's apartments, this shouldn't be
surprising).  Yup.  At the close of the millennium, television is our
wrathful diety.
I suppose also that the tag, "Movie of the Decade" is not
inappropriate.  It fits our media-saturated time well.
Anyway, did I actually like the movie?  Yes and no.  The "No" comes from
having problems getting into it in the first place.  I kept on thinking
"klutzy, klutzy, klutzy" as the television people when through their
acrobatics to keep Truman from realizing the truth.  There's minor
clumsiness when Truman picks up studio instructions on his car radio:
why not have rigged radios incapable of picking up certain
frequencies?  And why didn't they realize that Truman probably doesn't
know how to tack a sailboat into the wind?  You have smart people, who
have constructed an elaborate illusion of a TV studio, and yet they
don't know how to plan for contingencies beyond ham handed traffic jams
and nuclear plant meltdowns.
The most glaring clumsiness is the methods used to keep him in town:
make him afraid of the water, make him think travel is dangerous, tell
him that Sea Side is an earthly paradise.  It's easy to come up with
better ideas than this.  You can simply not tell him there's an
outside, a sort of medieval thing to do -- you'll fall off the edge,
say "hi" to the elephants and turtle on your way down -- but possible
because Truman more or less was raised in your Skinner Box.  You pretty
much can tell him anything you want.  This, though, makes him less like
us, hurting television ratings.  Alternatively, you can have this giant
inflated weather balloon roving the beaches, smothering anyone who
tries to leave.  The villagers can come up with spooky stories about
the thing, creating your prohibition.  (True, this is not "The
Prisoner", but it's a neat idea).  Perhaps best and most subtly, they
can simply use the techniques in "It's a Wonderful Life", which was
partially referred to in a TV program Truman watches: whenever he thinks
of leaving, saddle him with responsibility.  "About to go on my world
tour!  Whoops, the savings and loan is in trouble!"  There's no
weirdness in his staying -- he'll be just as good as George Bailey --
and there'll be tear jerker moments when he finds Zu Zu's petals in his
pocket.
One thing, brought up and then ignored: how do you handle Truman's
childhood friends?  He's known his best friend since they were seven
years old.  Can you trust a seven year old not to let Truman in on a
Really Big Secret?
Well, I did get into the movie more after all that.  It's an
entertaining film, not really the masterpiece that some people have
claimed, but certainly worth the two hours.  "Truman" may also mark a
new phase in Jim Carrey's career, that of a more serious actor.  He
does well in this movie: there a nice moment when he stops traffic,
realizing that he's the center of it all, and, near the end as he
reaches the edge of the world, he's convincing.  Think of Steve Martin,
going from "The Jerk" to, say, "Leap of Faith" or "The Spanish
Prisoner".  Yes, there are occasional regressions, like "Sgt. Bilko",
but his range is broader now.

THE TRUMAN SHOW ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(By now, most of you know how much my site SUCKS.
Come visit this train wreck of a webpage, anyway:
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
Some cool new features, plus a Little Shop of Horrors (1986) rare
DVD auction until June 12th.)
starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Natasha McElhone
screenplay by Andrew Niccol
directed by Peter Weir
Weir is well-respected in Hollywood for turning scripts with difficult
subject-matter into deceptively simple, powerful films, The Mosquito
Coast (utopia) and Fearless (post-traumatic stress disorder) among
them. In The Truman Show, Weir essentially breathes life into the
now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from
the inside-out. It certainly helps that he has an underrated performer
in top-form playing the title character, Truman Burbank.
By now you must be aware of the premise: unbeknownst to him, Truman
(Carrey) is the star of his own TV series, a 24-7 peep-show in which
he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations;
people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his
genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants. `Seahaven', his
hometown, and the show itself, are the brainchild of Christof
(Harris), who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon,
directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras.  For 30
years, Truman suspects nothing-`We accept the reality we're
given,' poses Christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny
town and visit a long lost love in `Fiji' (McElhone, who was
actually an actress fired by Christof for trying to break the
confidentiality agreement) overwhelms him. Thus, Christof and his team
suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of
Seahaven intact, lest Truman discover the world outside and put an end
to the highly-rated program.
In a few broad strokes, Weir creates a convincing second-reality, and
he has the good sense not to bring Christof into the picture until
almost three-quarters through. This allows us to comprehend and accept
Truman's world before we contextualize it. For all his madness,
Christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship,
and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it.
Truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be,
well, so darn nice; like a sibling (or, perhaps more appropriately, a
caged animal in an interactive zoo), they want to see him succeed. The
surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight
screenplay and a sympathetic Carrey-he really is an everyman here,
abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible, wide-eyed
bewilderment. Cinematically, The Truman Show is impeccable, stylishly
photographed by Peter Biziou and littered with symbolic images. As
well, it employs Wojciech Kilar's piece "Zycie za zycie'
masterfully and beautifully. If the film has any flaws, one may find
them in Laura Linney's characterization as Meryl, Truman's
"wife" (I doubt that Betty Crocker impersonation would fool anyone),
and in a subplot involving Truman's `father', which feels
curiously incomplete.
There are a few stupendous sequences, and the film pulls off a
wonderful trick: we become Truman's audience as much as the loyal
viewers in the film. They wear buttons asking `How will it end?'
I couldn't wait to know myself, though I didn't exactly want it
to end, for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most
complex-summer picture in years.

        *********************************************************
If you were expecting to see Jim Carrey doing his outrageous "shtick," you
will not find it in this film . . .  Which is a plus.   In ACE VENTURA,
while the movie was only mediocre, Carrey's antics were amusing. By the
time he made Cable Guy, which was better, and The Mask, which was still
better, he no longer needed the way-out eye-popping. .   Truman Burbank
(Jim Carrey) is quite a different character.
Truman has been an actor all of his 30 years but only recently has he
become aware of that.   It seems that soap opera director, Christof (Ed
Harris) has been playing god with Truman's life . . . since he was born.
He has made him the star of the longest running soap opera in TV history.
The story is indeed different than usual movie fare but not quite as
original as the publicists  would like us to believe.   Several articles
have been written about other movies with approximately the same premise.
However, once that is said,  the Truman Burbank movie stands on its own.
And Carrey is very good in it..
Director Christof constructed a gigantic sound stage that looked like a
typical American town, Seahaven.  All the buildings are quaint.  And
Truman has had no idea he had been living and growing into adulthood on a
huge movie set.  All his friends and family are actually actors in this
long-running soap opera, as is even his wife, Meryl (Laura Linney) while
every other day since he was born Truman has been watched by thousands of
TV cameras hidden in the make-believe town of Seahaven.  All his neighbors
are in the cast, equipped with earphones to receive instructions,  all
directed by Christof.    Truman's life has become the TV fare for billions
of watchers over the thirty years.
When it finally dawns on him that none of this is real, that he is a pawn
being manipulated by Someone, Truman rebels.  His single priority now
becomes his escape from Seahaven.   At the other end is the Director who
"conceived" "The Truman Show and is not about to let the series come to a
conclusion. It is interesting to contemplate what it may be like in the
next millennium when spying will be even easier than it is now. What will
happen to privacy?  Those are some of the specters the film raises.  The
question also comes up, "Why are billions of people over the years
watching Truman Burbank's seemingly uneventful life."   At no time are we
shown anything out of the ordinary in his existence.  Perhaps it is that
people are natural voyeurs.
While the scenes with Christof manipulating the sun and the moon and the
weather and ocean waves from his studio control room are funny, Truman's
escape on the sea seemed to go on too long.
Others in the cast are Truman's friend Marlon, an actor, of course,(Noah
Emmerich), Natascha McElhone, who plays Lauren/Sylvia,  Holland Taylor as
Truman's "mother"   And Kirk (Brian Delate.)

THE TRUMAN SHOW (Paramount - 1998)
Starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone
Screenplay by Andrew Niccol
Produced by Scott Rudin, Andrew Niccol, Edward S. Feldman,
  Adam Schroeder
Directed by Peter Weir
Running time: 102 minutes
Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   When William Shakespeare penned this passage, he could not have
   possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an
   abode would be broadcast across the continent, or where women would
   install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism
   into cash.  This is the world of today, and it is the perfect climate
   to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like THE TRUMAN SHOW.
   Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) seems to have the perfect life.  He has a
   pretty, doting wife Meryl (Laura Linney), a comfortable insurance
   sales position, an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island
   community of Seahaven, a reliable childhood buddy Marlon (Noah
   Emmerich) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every
   morning and his hydrophobia, this is paradise.
   Or so it would seem.  Bizarre, inexplicable incidents begin to crop
   up in Truman's life.  A lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from
   the sky.  A rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated'
   follows him around.  A radio broadcast appears to be describing his
   every move.  For the first time in his life, it is beginning to dawn
   on Truman that things are not what they appear to be.
   THE TRUMAN SHOW, directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol,
   is a remarkably well-constructed film, paced perfectly with every
   scene fluidly leading into the next.  Balancing drama with humour,
   thoughtfulness with abandon, this is a film which addresses an
   intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of
   sermonizing and whimsical fancy.  In many ways, Mr. Niccol's
   screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous GATTACA -- both films
   focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive
   adversity, with pivotal, character-defining moments occurring at sea.
   Although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the
   inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds, and ultimately
   just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch, there
   are moments through THE TRUMAN SHOW which are genuinely stirring and
   moving as Truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and
   grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception.
   Despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film,
   it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment,
   constantly light and accessible.  The tone achieved is far too sunny
   for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude, and as the
   carefully-stacked Seahaven house of cards tumbles down, the film
   eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that
   the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false.  The end
   act of THE TRUMAN SHOW essentially boils down to a rehash of the
   reliable, crowdpleasing Underdog Vs. The System formula.
   While the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept,
   some elements are lacking.  The device of mysterious Lauren/Sylvia
   (Natascha McElhone) as a contributing impetus to Truman's growing
   awareness isn't exactly convincing.  There's not much of a
   discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors
   themselves, and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the
   megalomaniac Christoff (Ed Harris) with regards to the moral
   ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the
   audience, thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film.
   In fact, although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes
   depicting the real world outside Truman's artificial utopia to a mere
   handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers, it might
   have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself
   even *more* deeply in the insulatory Seahaven world, with the
   resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally
   shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling.  Still,
   the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target, and its
   insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in
   conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic
   tirades such as that of the recent Costa Gavras film MAD CITY.
   I've always believed that the versatile Ms. Linney possesses a
   tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam
   in her eyes -- and in THE TRUMAN SHOW she runs rampant with her
   duplicitous character, mischievously flashing a glazed, insanely
   jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement
   slogans.  Cheerfully going over the top, it's hilarious to watch her
   -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to
   outshine the reigning King Of Comedy in the laughs department of a
   film?  Ms. Linney is a delight in the film.
   But it is Mr. Carrey who rules the show here.  He may not have been
   intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero Truman
   Burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic
   interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the
   character tremendous energy and eminent appeal: it's difficult not to
   root for Truman.  In a commanding performance, Mr. Carrey lends our
   protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes
   him a genuinely engaging presence, and acquits himself impressively
   in this dramatic turn, demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's
   an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening, and given his
   past track record, one almost instinctively anticipates Mr. Carrey to
   pull one of more infamous, and in this case, wholly inappropriate
   sight gags.  It's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor
   successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the
   centre of attention.
   In addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- Mr.
   Emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense
   of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by
   wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner in creating Truman's
   antiseptic, white picket-fenced smalltown utopia, and by Burkhard
   Dallwitz's original score.  Technical credits are first-rate all
   around.
   While THE TRUMAN SHOW is clearly a definitive high-concept film, it's
   not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors
   utilising common elements abound, ranging from 1965's SECRET AGENT
   through to the groundbreaking British 1967 TV series THE PRISONER.
   All the same, this is a visionary, award-calibre film: entertaining,
   provocative, and intelligent.
   The curious (and possibly disturbing) thing may be that although upon
   first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems
   unfathomably outrageous, it's abundantly clear that our society is
   rapidly approaching, if not actualisation, at least permissiveness of
   such a scenario.  Perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to
   Mr. Weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing
   that we accept it without question.  Perhaps we recognize a bit of
   ourselves in this world.

     - Jennifer Jason Leigh, CROOKED HEARTS

Harvey S. Karten
   "Cue the sun... I am the creator..." announces Christof (Ed
Harris), the director of television's longest running drama. 
Media bigwigs often have inflated views of themselves, but
this guy seems to be going over the top.  Is he bananas? 
Perhaps.  On second thought, maybe WE are; we who spend
so many hours each day watching the tube, carrying its
fashions, its dialogue, its concepts of hip to such an extent
that you can't blame those who put the images on the TV
sets from thinking that they're gods.  
   More American homes have TVs than baths.  Given that
the tube outnumbers the tub, obviously television has a
mighty big influence on us. The extensive authority of the
home screen is the focus of Peter Weir's movie, written by
Andrew Niccol and starring Jim Carrey in the second serious
role of his checkered career.  
   "Truman" is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), an
unwanted baby who even in the fetal stage has been adopted
by a corporation--a TV network company.  Conceivably no
better example of dramatic irony exists in any film ever made:
The entire world knows that Truman's life--his friends, his
wife, his job--is fraudulent, a big setup designed by Christof
for the amusement of the entire earth.  In Christof's wildly
imaginative project, the network honcho constructs the world's
largest stage set: an island peopled entirely by professional
actors (with the exception of Truman, who is the only true
man in the picture), antiseptic houses, an artificial ocean with
occasional bursts of synthetic rain, 5,000 hidden cameras
situated on the dashboard of Truman's car, on street lamps,
and on the persons of the actors, a counterfeit insurance
company which employs Truman and pays him (for all we
know) in play money which is good only on the island.  Even
the sun, the moon, the sky and the clouds are man-made. 
No wonder, then, that Christof considers himself The Creator
to a greater extent than even the producers and directors of
blockbuster shows like Seinfeld and I Love Lucy.  Truman
unwittingly becomes the best-known face in the entire world,
though he is the last to know this.
   Like Sophocles's Oedipus who kills his father and marries
his mother, only slowly realizing what he has done, Truman
gradually and ever so overdue becomes increasingly aware of
his condition.  As the clues drop--first a mysterious stage
lamp falls to the sidewalk in front of him, then he runs into his
father who was allegedly drowned in a boating accident for
which Truman was partly responsible--Truman bit-by-bit loses
his all-American nice-guy demeanor.  He becomes
imperceptibly suspicious and angry with the realization that he
is being manipulated by outside forces.  During this time--
which forms the bulk of the 104-minute film--we in the
audience who know more than the title character find quite a
bit of humor in the proceedings, humor which only rarely
shows itself as typical Jim Carrey shtick.  In one scene
Carrey's wife Meryl (Laura Linney) breaks into a conversation
she is having with her husband to deliver a cocoa
commercial, while in another instance she urges Truman to
throw out his broken lawn mower and buy a new one
(mentioning the brand he should favor).  She announces a
macaroni and cheese dinner with all the ecstasy of an actress
delivering a 30-second commercial, and props up boxes of
cereal on the kitchen table so that the brand name is seen by
the worldwide audience.  Much of the waggery revolves
around attempts by the actors on the Eden-like island to
dissuade Truman from leaving it, as this would be disastrous
for the show.  In a flashback, he tells his fifth-grade teacher
that he'd like to be an explorer like Magellan, but the teacher
responds, "You're too late: there's nothing left to explore." 
When Truman makes a mad dash for parts outside the control
of the TV station, he is stopped; at one point by an "accident"
at a nuclear station and at another by the mere presence of
water which he has been afraid to cross since the "drowning
death" of his father.  When he visits a travel agent (also an
actor) to book a flight to Fiji, where his college girl friend
allegedly now lives, the agent assures him that there are no
flights for at least a month.  Posters around the office warn
"this can happen to you" (featuring a plane hit by lightning)
and urge travelers to take out large insurance policies
because of the threat of airline terrorists and street gangs in
distant locations.
   If you can find more than one allusion to previous Carrey
movies, you're good. The one evident reference occurs when
Meryl is being driven by her husband at breakneck speed,
asks "Can you slow down?" and gets the "Liar, Liar" answer,
"Yes, I can."
   Written by Andrew Niccol, who created the spirited sci-fi
drama "Gattaca," "Truman" displays a great deal of the
scripter's imagination.  No other film in memory uses the
concept of a human being who has spent the entire thirty
years of his life in a plastic bubble to this extent or carries out
the fanciful narrative in such a clever, appealing, and well-
performed manner.  We are led to believe that Truman could
indeed be fooled into thinking his plastic existence, this
shadow of a life on the wall of a Platonic cave, is the
equivalent of a real, free-will experience.  
   Director Peter Weir has done a bangup job with Niccol's
script with the invaluable help of Dennis Gassner's precious
production design to convince us that Truman had no choice
other than to stay on the island.  The father's "drowning"
gives him a phobia of crossing water, the travel agent a fear
of flying, and his own wife and especially his best friend
Marlon (Noah Emmerich) the suggestion that there really is no
need to leave this paradise on earth.  When one actress,
Lauren (Natascha McElhone) takes pity on Truman and tries
to reveal the truth, she is quickly spirited away and when he
tries to go to Chicago, the bus is unable to start.  
   If you accept "The Truman Story" as one of the choicest
recent examples of imaginative fiction, you will indeed have a
wonderful experience in its throes.  If however you try to
decode it for The Meaning of Life as some critics have
attempted, you will be disappointed, because as satire it does
not work.  Are its creators trying to say that television
encourages voyeurism and destroys the celebrities it creates? 
If so, there is no reason to believe that the world's attention
can be riveted on this very ordinary man living an uneventful
life, one which, in fact, the producers want him to continue in
that any dramatic changes in his nature could expose the
conspiracy and end the 30-year-old show.  Are its creators
trying to say, as Christof declares, that we accept the reality
of the world with which we're presented and that we prefer to
live out our lives following the usual conventions, they misfire
here as well.  Truman is indeed determined to leave the
island he knows so well but is prevented by the force--in
some cases the traumas in his psyche, in others the artificially
created violence of nature, in still others the barricades set up
by "police."  Forget about Major Meaning.  This is not
"Network" but a highly enjoyable romp featuring the very
talented Jim Carrey, who fulfills Weir's promise as the best
actor around for Truman's role.  No other performer could as
well have portrayed his determination coupled with
vulnerability that allows us to suspend disbelief and enter one
of the movie industry's finest creations of an artificial world. 
The great Italian playwright, Luigi Pirandello, would be most
pleased by Weir and Niccol's take on the relationship between
art and life. Rated PG.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C)

I think the one thing that the general crop of Hollywood films lack
entirely is originality.  Most of them have a glimpse of originality
buried somewhere in them, but it seems to me that the vast majority are
padded with so many cliches and formulas that the films feel familiar
even if you haven't seen them before.  The Truman Show is a film
completely original in both its conception and execution, a picture so
intelligent and entertaining that I'm certain most will hail it as one
of the best films of the decade so far.
But it's not just a well-made movie -- it's an emotionally moving and
profoundly direct film that comes across as an all-new experience.  I
don't recall ever seeing a film that feels like this one.  Certainly
there are movies out there that attack the television industry (the
wonderful Quiz Show, for instance), but none of them do it in a manner
like this.  The image that director Peter Weir has created is seamless
and beautiful, Andrew Niccol's script is subtle and superb, and the
acting -- especially from Jim Carrey -- is perfect.  
Ideally, you should not know what the film is about before you see it. 
The trailers all tell you the big secret, though -- Carrey plays Truman
Burbank, a man who lives in Seahaven, Florida.  What he doesn't know but
the rest of the world does is that he's the star of a television show
that features every moment of his life.  He goes about his daily routine
as if it were a script, saying almost the exact same things to his wife,
Meryl (Laura Linney), that he did the previous day.  He works in a real
estate firm, and his best friend's name is Marlon (Noah Emmerich).
We've all considered the possibility that our lives are staged, that we
are at the center of the universe, that there might be people in white
coats looking at us at all times, that the walls might be illusions and
that we're actually in a laboratory somewhere.  The Truman Show takes
this idea and makes it somewhat pleasant (at least Truman isn't being
studied and probed for fun), but it also makes the concept believable. 
The show was created by Christof (Ed Harris), who is truly wrapped up in
the idea that he's created something wonderful, something pure -- much
more real than anything you can see in the real world.
The way Weir and Niccol set up the film is ingenious, because you don't
know for sure that Truman's at the center of everything (unless you've
seen the previews).  They drop hints though, such as moments during
which we see Truman through the eyes of a strange camera buried in the
bushes (we know it's a strange camera because of the oval matte around
the central image).  Weir allows these hidden cameras to be seen, but
all the hints are subtle (Truman's neighbor, for no particular reason,
carries around a garbage can at eye level, and the camera in the side of
the can is visible, but not obvious).  I can't effectively convey the
sheer completeness of the way Weir has created this fictional little
town, but this is the kind of film that you can watch repeatedly and
still see new things with each viewing.
As the film progresses, Truman starts seeing things that baffle him.  A
stage light falls out of the sky and crashes onto the street in front of
his house.  He examines it as if it were dropped from an alien ship (a
few seconds later he hears a newscast which announces that a passing
airplane had dropped some of its parts).  Soon, though, he sees things
that can't be explained with such ease.  He gets so bent on the idea
that he rushes into a strange building when no one would expect it, and
finds that there are people in a fake elevator eating donuts.  
Quickly he's thrown out onto the street by security guards.
Truman wants to get out of Seaside and go to Fiji, mostly because of a
woman (Natasha McElhone) whom he met in high school.  The woman was
actually an extra who tried to tell Truman that his life was a
television show, but ended up failing.  Truman's attempts at getting out
of the city are not successful, for every time he tries to leave
something strange stops him (random forest fires, sudden traffic jams,
etc.).  He also sees lots of things that are intended to deter him, such
as a poster of an airplane under attack from a giant bolt of lightning,
with the caption, "IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!" in block letters across the
top.
Weir's direction is amazing (he should easily be in for the Best
Director nomination), and his work is complemented by the wonderfully
pleasing aesthetics of Seahaven.  Cinematographer Peter Biziou and
production designer Dennis Gassner have done splendid work with the look
of the film; the imagery, such as in all the scenes with Truman sitting
on the beach, is absorbing and immersive, and is matched perfectly with
Philip Glass' score (it's worth mentioning that the musical score is
always flowing lightly in the background).  Even without the script, The
Truman Show is simply a pleasure to look at.
With this film, Carrey proves that he can act.  But this isn't just a
"coming out" performance, or a performance that everyone will adore
simply because he doesn't play himself.  This is a truly great
accomplishment, and deserves to be recognized on higher levels.  Carrey
is complex and subtle, but still manages to be hilarious in a more
realistic way than he has in the past (perhaps the funniest scene is
when Meryl forces a product placement for coffee at a moment when Truman
is very upset).  Carrey never goes overboard, but he's so good at
playing this character that I can't imagine anyone else in the role.  He
has the perfect face and demeanor for the character.
The supporting work is also fantastic, particularly from Ed Harris. 
Harris is a versatile actor (though he's often typecast as the bad-ass
military guy), and here is utterly convincing as a man who truly
believes that he is doing a great thing both for Truman and for the
entire world.  Linney is also perfectly pitched, and her acting is
clever in that she's playing an actress who constantly acts.  Natascha
McElhone, with her gleaming eyes and soft smile, is simply magnetic to
look at (a good casting choice), but she also turns in a great
performance as Truman's true love.
I haven't talked about the fact that the film is uproariously funny. 
This is the best kind of humor -- you have to think before you laugh,
and most of the jokes will only strike if you're paying close
attention.  Some of the humor is over-the-top if you think about it
(watch closely the scene in which Truman sees his father dressed as a
homeless man), but every attempt at humor in The Truman Show hits with
full force.
But this isn't just a comedy.  This is a smart and intelligent film
that actually takes a satirical view of the television industry.  It's
also a moving picture, because Truman is so well-written by Niccol and
well-acted by Carrey -- he's a likable man, and we want him to be able
to succeed and live a real life.  The Truman Show is actually quite
acidic towards the industry, but the message hardly bogs down the story
(note the final shot of the film, though, and then ask yourself what the
point of the film is).  Above all things, though The Truman Show is
original.  It's a new kind of film experience, as intelligent as it is
funny, and perfectly made as it is perfectly acted.  I recommend it
unreservedly to all viewers to love great films.

     Go ahead, confess.  You've suspected for sometime now that your
life isn't real.  All those objects that dot your environment are just
elaborate facades, and those people around you, who claim to be your
friends, are merely actors in some vast drama of undecipherable
portent.
     Although I can't be sure about you, this is exactly what happened
to the unsuspecting Truman Burbank.  Truman is played brilliantly by
Jim Carrey in a dramatic role with sporadic comedic touches.  In the
most promising plot for a movie in a long time, THE TRUMAN SHOW is
about a human being who, since birth, has been the subject of a
24-hour-a-day cable show - the world's most popular soap opera or
television series of any kind.  "It's all true," Truman's best friend
Marlon (Noah Emmerich) explains to us in the opening scene.  "Nothing
you see here on this show is fake.  It's just controlled."
     Directed with absolute precision by THE YEAR OF LIVING
DANGEROUSLY's Peter Weir, and written smartly by GATTACA's Andrew
Niccol, THE TRUMAN SHOW is that rare breed, the movie that borrows from
other sources and yet comes up with something so fresh and innovative
that it has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  It has some of the
look and feel of the television show, "The Prisoner," and some of the
scenes, especially the "backstage" ones, will remind you of Disney's
Magic Kingdom, but the movie itself is one of a kind.
     With Dennis Gassner's pristine sets of bright whites that would
put Normal Rockwell to shame and with an inviting score by Philip
Glass, the picture is a feast for the eyes and ears.  The
cinematographer uses bright primary colors to give the film the
two-dimensional realism of an Andy Warhol painting.
     Living in an artificial world populated by actors playing his
friends and relatives, Truman has rarely doubted his world until
recently.  Whenever he has misgivings, his buddies, like Marlon, assure
him not to worry.  "The last thing I'd ever do is lie to you," Marlon
tells him with absolute sincerity.  That this is a line thrown to
Marlon via hidden transmitters from the off-screen director, Christof,
Truman never guesses.  A moving show, it considers a host of issues,
not the least of which is what it means to be a friend.  Marlon's been
there for Truman all his life.  Just because Marlon's an actor and he's
told what to do, does that lessen the benefit of his companionship?
     The would-be God, Christof, known as the world's greatest
televisionary, is played with intensity by a guru-looking Ed Harris.
Christof, having at the television show's outset arranged for the first
ever adoption of a baby by a corporation, is hoping that the now grown
Truman will supply that scoop-of-scoops, the world's first on-air
conception.
     Truman is married, or thinks he is, to a wonderful wife named
Meryl, played with ear-to-ear smiles by Laura Linney from ABSOLUTE
POWER.  In a movie so rich that it deserves a second or even third
viewing, watch carefully how Truman eventually discovers that their
vows may be in question.  Carrey, in one of his most subtle
performances, provides a likeable hero with whom we can empathize.
     Truman wants to leave his all too perfect existence to go to Fiji,
where he hopes to find Sylvia, the girl that got away.  Played with
captivating eyes by Natascha McElhone from MRS. DALLOWAY, Sylvia in one
of the show's flashbacks tries to tell Truman about his sham of a life
before she is whisked away.  What he doesn't realize, of course, is
that the reason he couldn't marry her is because it wasn't in his
life's script.
     Slowly and delicately, the fascinating story throws Truman clues
that his paradise on earth may be one giant conceit, fabricated for
purposes inconceivable to him.  When flaws appear on the set, such as a
light that falls incongruously from the heavens, the townsfolk
conveniently but not entirely convincingly explain them away.
     As the movie advances, we cut more frequently to the control room
where Christof and company - wearing "Love him. Protect him." T-shirts
-- are pulling all of the strings.  They can cue the sun, set off
dramatic storms and have the actors say or do anything they like.  We
also cut to several locations around the globe where people hang on
Truman's every word and hold their collective breaths when he's in
danger.  Like a video aquarium, the show, which keeps the camera on
Truman even as he sleeps, provides comfort to the insomniacs all over
the planet.
     There is even a scene in which Christof - now there's a name not
lightly chosen - is asked on a talk show why Truman believes in his
artificial environment.  "We accept the reality of the world we are
presented," he explains.  "It's as simple as that."
     If you think modern movies are blatant in their product
placements, this television show puts them all to shame.  To pay for
the elaborate production, everything in the show is for sale.
     "How will it end?" reads a small button on Sylvia's blouse.  How
indeed?  The absolutely riveting story has both (television and movie)
audiences on the edge of their seats wondering.  Staged brilliantly,
the ending wraps up a masterful show perfectly.
     THE TRUMAN SHOW runs 1:44.  It is rated PG for a few mild
profanities.  The film would be acceptable for all ages, but kids
probably need to be around nine to understand and appreciate it.
     My son Jeffrey, almost 9, thought is was "a pretty good movie."
He was fascinated by the story and kept wondering what would happen
next and when Truman would figure it all out.  His favorite scene was
the one when a wheelchair traffic jam was used to keep Truman away from
the edge of the set.  (This was the most complicated and subtle movie
that he's ever seen and liked.  His body language showed how wrapped up
in the story he was.)

The notion that television is corrupt and that it corrupts minds is as old as
the invention of television itself. There have been a plethora of films
concentrating on this technological theme from the classic "Network" to the
recent successor "Wag the Dog." Both films are indictments against the idea
that television is the medium containing the message. "The Truman Show" is a
startlingly original, comically engaging portrait of a world where the medium
is not only the message, but it encapsulates an entire town. 
Rubber-faced clown Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman who
has a beautiful, almost too beaming wife (Laura Linney) whom he says good-bye
to before leaving for work. Every morning, Truman is greeted by his neighbors
and the townspeople to whom he responds with the catch phrase "Good morning.
Good evening, and good night." This Connecticut-style town where Truman lives
is Seahaven, a polished, "Father Knows Best" community completely and yet not
so completely removed from reality. It is reminiscent of a huge shopping mall
where there's no traffic, no noise, and no problems - everything is picture
perfect. Before you can whisper "The Stepford Wives," we gradually discover
(before Truman does) that nothing is what it seems. Apparently, Truman is the
unknowing star of a 24-hour television program where he is the main attraction
(and has been since birth), and his home in Seahaven is actually a giant,
dome-like television studio! To make matters worse, he is the star of the
biggest hit on television. 
The film's idea is like something out of "The Twilight Zone," but writer Andrew
Niccol fleshes out this story with care and humanity, as in a Ray Bradbury
novel. What could have been a one-joke premise becomes a deep, philosophical,
unusually poignant film. The humanity emanates from Jim Carrey's uncanny
Everyman character affected by the very people in his life - his mother who
reminds him of an ersatz Mount Rushmore vacation, his wife who may or may not
be a nurse and always wears a red sweater, his best friend (Noah Emmerich) who
brings a six-pack along every time Truman has a problem, a former girlfriend
(Natasha McElhone) hauled away by her father never to be seen again, and the
general townsfolk who try to put him in front of advertisements hung in the
town square. Truman's whole life is a fabrication - a lie for the sake of
entertaining millions of viewers on television, and the TV cameras are at every
corner of Truman's existence documenting his daily life. 
Jim Carrey is in super tip-top form here playing the bewildered Truman with
admirable restraint and complete assuredness. Don't expect fart jokes or
scatological humor of the "Ace Ventura" kind here; this is Carrey's first
dramatic role and he does wonders with it. At every turn, he suggests and
implies Truman's innocence, even when Truman starts to get suspicious about his
surroundings. It is a role Charlie Chaplin could have played with the same
degree of panache and heartbreak. My favorite scene is when Truman has an
argument with his wife and notices that she is addressing someone other than
himself when she utters:
And before I forget, there's the crucial role played by Ed Harris, who excels
like no other actor from movie to movie, and here he is at his unqualified best
as Cristof, the God-like creator of the show who barks orders such as "Cue the
sun!" or "Bring out the rain! Make the thunder louder!" Harris's final moments
where he discloses Truman's life, from his birth to his childhood memories, is
deeply touching and as emotionally discreet as this actor has ever been on
screen. 
"The Truman Show" is directed by Peter Weir ("The Last Wave," "Dead Poet's
Society") and he does a remarkably acute job of showing the world Truman
occupies which is not that different from what America is now becoming - a
Rockwellian nightmare where everyone pretends to be what they aren't. If Truman
is not real in his own eyes because of the part he unknowingly plays on
television, then who is he?

THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998)
A film review by Ivana Redwine
Copyright 1998 by Ivana Redwine
Starring: Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, Laura Linney as Meryl, Noah
Emmerich as Marlon, Natascha McElhone as Lauren/Sylvia, Ed Harris as
Christof. Directed by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Andrew Niccol.
Cinematography by Peter Biziou.
There is a stunning scene in THE TRUMAN SHOW where Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey, in a breakthrough dramatic role) attempts to have a serious
conversation with his wife Meryl (Laura Linney, who gives the role just the
right touch of icy hypocrisy). He tries desperately to communicate, but his
words do not dent the armor of her soul-numbing insincerity. As Truman
tries to tear down her seemingly impenetrable facade, she reacts in a
subtly horrifying, surreal manner--she suggests that Truman might like to
try a new product called Mococoa and launches into a sales pitch for it.
During her spiel, she holds up the product's package as if to an unseen
camera. Like the rest of the film, this scene is slick, smart, and superbly
realized, but Carrey's performance is what gives it its emotional core. His
face reflects just the right mix of dismay, anger, and disbelief, as he
slowly begins to understand that something is terribly wrong.
A rather similar scene a little later in the film also strikes a
particularly moving emotional chord. Truman and his best friend Marlon
(Noah Emmerich) spend an evening together, nursing a couple of beers while
sitting on the end of an unfinished bridge. Although it sounds like pure
paranoia, Truman tells Marlon, "Everybody seems to be in on it." But Marlon
looks Truman straight in the eye and says convincingly, "I'm not in on it,
Truman, because the last thing I would ever do is lie to you." However, it
turns out that in spite of Marlon's seeming sincerity, he is getting his
lines from an ear piece. At this moment, Truman does not yet know that
Marlon is an actor. Everything Marlon has ever said or done around Truman
all their lives has been a well-performed lie. I found this to be a
powerful, memorable scene, and it struck me as yet another hard-hitting
example of the tragic emotional toll on Truman as he slowly learns about
the artificial world surrounding him. No matter what he tries, Truman
cannot communicate with or get close to his family or friends because they
are not what they seem. In this scene, the sadness in Truman's eyes is only
a shadow of the devastation he will eventually feel when he realizes the
extent to which he has been cruelly deceived by those he loves and trusts.
For almost 30 years, Truman Burbank has been unaware that he is the star of
an uninterrupted, live television broadcast. It is the ultimate in reality
programming. In addition to being the longest running show in history, it
is also the most popular, with a devoted, world-wide audience. In fact,
some of his more ardent fans get a feeling of reassurance from keeping the
show on while Truman sleeps; but if his audience ever gave any thought to
Truman's exploitation, they would need more than a television night light
to keep their terror safe.
Without ever having committed a crime, Truman has been held captive his
entire life in a man-made world that is enclosed within a huge dome, a
structure so large that it can be seen from space. Within the dome is
Seahaven Island, which is actually a huge stage set. Except for Truman, all
Seahaven's citizens are actors. It is a created world with the
verisimilitude of reality, and seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day,
ingeniously concealed cameras broadcast every aspect of Truman's life to a
global village of vacuous voyeurs. In concept it is a cross between "Candid
Camera" and the omnipresent, all-seeing eye of Big Brother in George
Orwell's novel "1984."
I was particularly impressed with the satiric imagination that went into
the design of Seahaven; it is a safe and sanitized utopian dream, a
community seemingly conjured out of the plastic world of 1950s television
comedies. The feel of Seahaven is similar to walking into the world that
exists only within the frame of a Norman Rockwell illustration--a
heartwarming place where the smiles seldom waver. Yet, on closer
inspection, there is something unsettlingly saccharine and hollow about the
conspicuous absence of the gritty, untidy realities of life.
A chilling aspect of the story is that Truman was adopted before his birth,
not by surrogate parents, but by a corporation. Instead of being nurtured
by parental love, Truman has been treated his whole life as if he were a
commodity. Everything that surrounds him forms a matrix for product
promotion, and he is kept in a place that is little more than a picturesque
prison, while his free will is callously manipulated.
The puppet master pulling the strings of Truman's life is the television
show's creator and director Christof (well played by Ed Harris)--a man so
enraptured with his own creative vision that his arrogance and egotism make
him blind to the moral implications of Truman's plight. I found Christof to
be a brilliantly conceived and absolutely frightening character. The
control that Christof holds over Truman's life and world is almost
God-like--at one point he directs his crew to "Cue the sun!"-- but Cristof
is a faux-deity whose vanity makes his blood run very cold. He is even
cynical enough to go as far as to contrive events to instill fears in
Truman that will keep him from leaving Seahaven Island. For example, Truman
believes that when he was a small boy, he witnessed his father's drowning;
but in actuality what appeared to be the drowning was merely a staged
event, designed to make Truman fear the water.
At one point in the film, Christof makes a provocative statement: "We
accept the reality with which we're presented." Few people have the kind of
courage it takes to question the veracity of the world they are presented
with, but when there are too many disturbing incidents for Truman to
ignore, his faith in everything he has believed all his life begins to
unravel. His first clue that something is rotten in Seahaven is when a
stage light falls from the sky, nearly landing on top of him. Another time,
something goes awry with his car radio, and he hears actors getting their
instructions instead of the radio program that was on the air. On another
occasion Truman finds a homeless man wandering around town who claims to be
his father--the man Truman watched drown years ago and believed to be dead.
Later in the film, a close inspection of Truman's wedding photo reveals his
bride's fingers were crossed when the picture was taken. 
But what finally makes Truman take action--spurring him on a quest for the
truth--is the memory of his true love (played by Natascha McElhone), a
woman who went by two names, Lauren and Sylvia (indicative of the slippery
nature of her identity). On a brief romantic moonlit walk on the beach, she
courageously told him, "Everyone is pretending, Truman." Soon after she
said this, she was whisked away by her father, who dismissed her words as
the ramblings of a madwoman. Yet Truman is haunted by her last words to
him: "Get out of here! Come and find me." She vanishes from his life, but
what has actually happened is that she was tossed off the show for straying
from the script. Truman's refusal to accept her disappearance is the
impetus for unraveling the web of lies that has been the matrix of his
reality for so long. He is determined to go to Fiji, where he believes he
will find her. But suspiciously, every time he tries to leave, strange
events prevent him from doing so. 
Truman's attempts to escape Seahaven brought a haunting question to my
mind: What would freedom mean to Truman? Through television many millions
of fans around the world are more familiar with his face than they are with
those of people they see frequently in real life. But Truman is a person
who has never had the luxury of a private self. I imagined that if he ever
made it to the outside world, he would have even less privacy--his fans
would hound his every move. Yet, if he remained in the artificial
environment of Seahaven, he would be little more than a pawn trapped in an
illusory world. Either way, his life would be a kind of living hell. 
Although this film is not without its comic touches, the dramatic aspects
of Jim Carrey's performance are what really surprised me. Working different
ground than the kind of manic, exaggerated, over-the-top comedy that made
him famous, Carrey brings off some subtler tricks here. He manages to do as
much dramatically with slight changes in his facial expression and body
language as he has shown in other films that he could do comically with his
trademark brand of humor. Truman Burbank is a fascinating archetypical
hero, an innocent everyman who has the courage to search for the truth and
not to accept the lies he has been told all his life. But Truman is a
character who is more mythic/iconic than realistic and thus is by design
not a fully faceted character. Yet Carrey puts so much into the role that
he almost makes Truman more than that, and it is difficult to imagine the
movie without him. Carrey's performance gives the film its heart and
humanity, and I believe that if he had not been in it, THE TRUMAN SHOW
could have easily been little more than a fascinating intellectual
exercise. 
This is an extremely well crafted movie. I felt that the superb production
design and cinematography intentionally imbued the film with a slick,
soulless artificiality. This made the scenes appear wholesomely picturesque
and sweetly beautiful, yet at the same time somehow so cold and sterile
that there was an eerie deadliness to them. To my mind, the visual aspects
of the movie were meant to echo and intensify the subtle undercurrent of
horror that runs throughout the film. It is rare that style and substance
work together so seamlessly in a movie. THE TRUMAN SHOW is a multifaceted
and resonant film of ideas that has aspects of myth, allegory, and fable.
It even delves into complex philosophical issues such as illusion and
reality. A far cry from the usual summer movie fare, this is a thoughtful,
nuanced film that also manages to be highly entertaining.

 [Theater rating: ***: very good sound and picture, average seats]
 All genres of storytelling must establish and define the reality in which
 their stories take place. This challenge is even more difficult and thus more
 crucial to satire, where in the "comedy" lies mostly in style and theme. It is
 these basic principles upon which "The Truman Show" is based - the story of a
 reality within a reality, but neither are defined well enough to create for
 theme or substance. It's certainly clever, but not executed as such.
 Entertainment in the 1990s has become more and more polarized. The big-budget
 movies and TV shows have continued to inflate in all aspects. More emphasis is
 placed on style over substance - who needs acting and writing when you've got
 special effects? Some efforts have been made to counter this inflation, most
 notably a rapid increase in independently-produced comedy and drama which
 claim to be driven by minutia of some sort, but with some exceptions, have
 exploited their "hooks" the same way the blockbusters exploit their budget. 
 Perhaps this film serves as some kind of ultimate alternative to the major
 forms of entertainment. It presents us with an antithesis of fiction -
 reality.  Truman Burbank (Carrey), has been on television every day since his
 birth (hence the title) and has never suspected as much. We're invited to
 experience everything he does since there's no way of truly knowing what could
 happen. He lives in a small coastal town where everyone either directly or
 indirectly affects him since they're all actors who have been told what to do,
 but must improvise what they say and how they do things. 
 What would it be like to watch an ordinary person? One would think it would
 be boring, after all, isn't that the point of entertainment - to escape
 reality? Jerry Seinfeld said it best, "Everyone on TV is doing something
 better than you. You never see people sliding off the edge of the sofa with
 potato chip crumbs on their face." But this film would have us believe that
 would be completely fascinating, or at least in its reality. Viewers are glued
 to their television sets afraid to miss anything, while the corporation behind
 the project basks in the continued success of the show. Unfortunately, it is
 in this aspect the film is severely flawed. Little attention is given to the
 kind of world which would not only condone the whole idea of the show, but be
 enthralled by it. The few viewers we see are of the exaggerated, cartoonish
 sort, which does keep with the overall attitude, but there's no authenticity
 to anyone's motivation. The show's creator and director, known only as
 Christof (Harris), seems to care about Truman, yet he never hesitates to
 exploit him, even to the point of killing him, just because he can.
 Another major flaw is in the storytelling itself. It's obvious as soon as the
 film opens what the premise is (as if the massive promotion hadn't already
 given it away). There's no sense of mystery since Truman is clued into the
 truth of his reality right from the get-go, and thus the plot is all about
 Truman's awareness of his situation and his attempt to escape it. The story
 would have worked better if we were just as clueless as Truman and had to
 figure it out too. Instead, everything is obviously phony, but it would have
 been interesting to see that phoniness presented as a reality.
 Truman's world is that of "Nick At Nite" combined with every commercial ever
 made, which creates for many comical and satirical situations such as Truman's
 friend Marlon (Emmerich) who's always coming by with a six-pack of beer and
 says things like "it doesn't get any better than this," and his wife Meryl
 (Linnley) who only says bubbly, encouraging things to him. Besides losing his
 "father" in a boating accident as a child, his life has been peachy.
 It would seem only natural for themes about the mass hypnotism of television
 and the media to crop up, but the film doesn't take advantage of the
 situation. Truman is a prisoner, and this idea of imprisonment by the media is
 one of the film's predominant themes, but it's not as powerful as could be due
 to the jumbled script. There's just not enough motivation to justify the idea
 of "The Truman Show;" why it was created, why it is successful, why any of the
 cast or crew members are involved with the show, and most importantly, why the
 show has run smoothly for 30 years without Truman catching on.
 Not to say that "The Truman Show" is without resonance. It is interesting and
 thought-provoking due to its premise, but premise alone isn't a bankable
 niche.

Oh come on - you must have heard the plot of this one by now. A child is
raised from birth under the eyes of TV cameras, unaware that his entire
life is a top-rating television show.
"The Truman Show" has garnered a lot of prepublicity, albeit in a
passive manner and for entirely good reasons. Peter Weir is a skilled
director ("Fearless", "Witness", "Picnic at Hanging Rock" etc.). The
writer created the elegant "Gattaca". The central idea is one that has
probably occurred to everyone: What if the entire world is run for me?
How do I know it's all real? So "The Truman Show" arrives to some
expectations.
Jim Carrey, perhaps having learnt that less is more, is thankfully under
control and surprising good as the increasingly paranoid Truman. Ed
Harris gives a tour-de-force performance as Christof, the director of
"The Truman Show" who, although remote and clinical, clearly loves
Truman. And the central idea is dazzlingly realised. Truman's home town
is a hermetic environment, a physical virtual reality in which the stars
are stage lamps, the citizens line up in the morning at "first
positions", every encounter is orchestrated, and even the weather bends
to the whim of the director. A whole world of merchandising, Truman
T-shirts and Truman bars, follow and lead the TV show. It's a
breathtaking vision.
Which doesn't explain the nagging sense of disappointment when the
credits roll. What's wrong with this film? That's difficult to say. Half
of the problem, I think, is that the film assumes you know what it's
about from the very beginning. If someone were to watch "The Truman
Show" without any foreknowledge, I'd suspect they would be very puzzled
indeed and see a very different film to the one I saw. Relying on
knowledge of publicity is lazy at best.
The other half of the problem is that the script doesn't seem to know
what to do with its big setup. It has a story, but is not really about
anything. Is this a commentary about television and the media? If so,
it's a very muted one. The vast global audience watching Truman is shown
caring for his fate and cheering on his triumphs. It is only at the very
end that it dare be suggested that to them, Truman is not a person but
just entertainment. However, other possible interpretations have been
floated. Is it a metaphor for the relationship between humanity and God?
Maybe - director Christof acts fairly God-like. Is it a gloss on
paranoia and schizophrenia? Truman's behaviour lends some weight to this
theory. But still there's that feeling of uneasiness as if the film is
crying out to make a point or say something, but is being stifled. This
emptiness leads one - unfairly - to dwell on plot inconsistencies and
how clumsily the TV show is run. It becomes implausible that the
directors of Truman's life have stayed hidden from him for 30 years, so
oafish and blunt are their tricks. (The actors all have radio earphones,
yet blindly give themselves away where a few instructions from the
omniscient central control would have defused the situation. Their
search for Truman when he is lost totally shatters the illusion of the
programme, yet they hope to keep filming the show.) These are doubts
that should never occur to the viewer, and wouldn't have had the central
story been more engrossing.
In fact, "The Truman SHow" is an oddly pleasant and mild film, where one
would have expected an impactful or thoughtful one. It's still a good
film, but one that's good despite its realisation. [***/interesting] and
a reproduction of a good painting on the Sid and Nancy scale.

Director Peter Weir takes another "better-known as a comedian" actor
(Carrey) and parades him around in a tale of drama, comedy and fantasy.
His previous subject for this matter had been Robin Williams in his
critically acclaimed DEAD POETS SOCIETY back in 1989.
PLOT:
Truman Burbank is a man whose entire life is being taped for television
viewing purposes. A TV show, aptly named The Truman Show, has broadcast
his life 24 hours a day since his birth. Everybody in his life are
actors: his wife, his best friend, his neighbours, his co-workers.
Everybody is in on it, except for Truman. Then one day, he begins to
radiate some suspicions... 
CRITIQUE:
Extremely original, well-written piece that ultimately left me
emotionally detached, and feeling bored at certain times. This movie is
written impeccably by the same writer of GATTACA (6/10), and covers
most of its bases extremely well in regards to the who, what, where,
when and hows that you may find yourself asking over its 100-minute
playtime. Having said that, many of its dramatic sequences did very
little to move me, and left me wondering if I should be caring more
about Truman than I ultimately did.
Some scenes were quite funny, others original...but all in all, the
film was basically nothing more than just a few creative ideas plugged
into a well-fabricated fantastical environment. Nothing blew me away
here, folks! Carrey was decent in his role, but I thought his character
was exaggerated at times (Does anyone really greet their neighbours the
way he did in real life?? Gimme a break.) Ed Harris was good, but his
range didn't go much further than standing around acting cool and
arrogant. The rest of the cast were also satisfactory, but no real
standouts. Interesting, but nothing more than that.
Overall, this film should fluffily entertain and delight most people in
regards to its original structure, style and plot line, but personally,
I found nothing "deeper" in it than that. No real reason to go see it
at the movie shoppes though. I suggest you wait until its video launch
six months from now. "Movie of the decade" ??? I think not. Let's all
remember that GOODFELLAS (9/10) was actually released in 1990, people
:)
