The prize-winning masterpiece of director Jacques Feyder, stars his wife
Francoise Rosay, Jean Murat, Louis Jouvet and many other excellent actors.
Tongue-in-cheek comedy-farce is set in a Flemish town in the early 1600s.
When Spanish soldiers show up, the men act like cowards, the panicky mayor
pretends to be dead, and his spirited wife organizes the women to give the
conquerors a good time. Lavishly and minutely detailed, the historically
impressive re-creation (by the great Lazare Meerson) of the town, of
paintings by Dutch masters and of the locals posing for them, make this a
unique, inventive, beautiful and joyously immoral treat .
Feyder  himself summarized his film as follows: łEn 1610, un ambassadeur
des Provinces-Unies traverse les Pays-Bas avec sa suite et, comme les
chemins ne sont pas surs, avec son escorte, cšest-a-dire vingt-quatre
piquiers et ving-quatre arquebusiers. Pas un de plus. Le bourgmestre dšune
petite bourgade, se souvenant des exces de la soldatesque, est pris de
panique et decide de faire le mort pour eviter dšheberger le diplomate.
Madame la bourgmestre, revoltee par cette couardise, galvanise les femmes
et organise pour lšambassadeur et sa suite une reception triomphale; elle
arive, par la meme occasion, a marier sa fille selon son propre choix.˛
TranslaTION : " In 1610, an Ambassador of the United Provinces is crossing
the Low Countries with his retinue, and since the roads are not safe, he
has an escort of 24 pike-bearers and 24 firearm bearers. Not one more. The
mayor of a small town remembers the excesses of the military and is panic
stricken. He decides to pretend that he is dead, so as to avoid having to
play host to the diplomat. The Mayor's wife, however is revolted by this
cowardice. She galvanizes the local women and organizes for the ambassador
and his people a triumphant welcome. By the same token, she manages to have
her daughter marry the man the young girl wanted."
This masterpiece of French cinema is a lavish, spectacular and minute
historical reconstruction with superb production values, notably in sets
and artifacts (by the great Lazare Meerson), and costumes. (The town of
Boom still exists in Belgium. And the houses built were on a slightly
smaller scale, to stress the importance of the humans and to permit easier
framing of the scenes.)
Remarkable and inseparable from the look of the film, is its re-creation of
the world of Flemish painters, with Jan Breughel having an important role
in the plot. He was the son of the more famous Pieter Breughel and brother
to the painter Pieter Breughel the Younger. In the film he is much younger
than he would have been in the early 1600s.
The plot is one long series of tongue-in-cheek satire that ranges from
overt to covert, with farcical as well as joyously immoral situations. The
acting is superior. Someone said that Mrs. Burgmeister persuades the local
ladies that" it s better to be laid than dead."  An amusing łjeu de mots˛
but a simplification of the ironical barbs at the male bourgeoisie, the
cleverness of women who are at the same time gutsy, inventive, feminine and
attracted to the manly (and sometimes sophisticated) strangers from the
South. On purpose or not, łLa Kermesse˛ is definitely an early feminist
screen comedy.
łLysistrata˛ and łThe Merry Wives of Windsor˛ come to mind, but łLa
Kermesse˛ is its own, marvelously well conceived entity. It was produced by
a German Company, Tobis, and almost simultaneously a German version was
made by Feyder, with his wife Francoise Rosay again as the only holdover
from the French work. The film was called łDie Klugen Frauen˛ (łThe Clever
Women˛). At its premiere in Berlin, it was enthusiastically received by a
Whošs Who audience which included Dr. Josef Goebbels*, the German Minister
for Propaganda. It is this version (contrary to the misinformation in most
books) that received the Best Director Award at the Venice Festival. The
French film was awarded the Grand Prix du Cinema Francais in 1936, as well
as the Best Foreign Film Award by the New York Film Critics.
The movie caused controversies as well as small riots initially. Some
Flemish people protested the mocking portrait of Flemish notables. Others
saw in it allusions to the Flemish collaborators during the Germansš
occupation of the area during World War I.  The movie was even called
łNazi-inspired.˛
All this died down soon, however. Still, it is easy to see why Josef
Goebbels may have liked the idea of submission to conquerors.
* This brings me to the inaccurate story that after France was occupied in
World War II, Goebbels and his ilk persecuted Feyder and Rosay and forced
them to flee. The couple did prefer, at one point, to simplify their lives
and not have to work for the Nazis, first by going to the South of France,
then to Switzerland where they taught. There, after they had made another
film together, Ms. Rosay left for England while her husband remained in
Geneva until waršs end.  (Edwin Jahiel)
