While following the same basic formula as all movies of its genre, Boaz 
Yakin's "Remember the Titans" is a surprisingly well-made football dramedy 
that, thanks to the assured, non-stereotypical screenplay by Gregory Allen 
Howard, manages to genuinely entertain and excite, even when it is offering 
up a cliched moment or two. Simply put, it is the best sports film since 
1993's "Rudy."
Based on a true story set during the first year of integration between the 
black and white students at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, 
Virginia, circa 1971, "Remember the Titans" tells of the famed Titans 
football team, which was headed up that very same year by the team's first 
black coach, earnest family man Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). At first, 
previous head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is upset to be downgraded to 
merely Boone's assistant, but just as Boone teaches his team how to get along 
and overcome their racial and prejudicial differences, Yoast begins to 
sympathize and deeply relate to Boone himself.
One of the pleasures in watching "Remember the Titans" is realizing how the 
movie is not so much about the Titans football team winning the state 
championship, as it is about the team players learning to respect each other 
and using the sport as a way of expressing their future goals and dreams in 
life. Too often sports films rely solely on the suspense of whether the 
hero's team will win "the big game," sacrificing character development for 
such a worn-out plotline, and thus, they fail because 9.9 times out of 10 it 
is a given which team will come out on top. "Remember the Titans" does things 
a bit different by exposing itself as not only a so-called "football movie," 
but also an intelligent, if somewhat commercialized, view of race relations 
in 1971's Northern Virginia.
The cast is top-flight, particularly the younger actors, who create distinct 
characters out of potentially one-dimensional supporting roles. Ryan Hurst 
(1998's "Saving Private Ryan") is an absolute standout as head white captain 
Gerry Bertier, while his nemesis-turned-close-friend Julius Campbell is, 
likewise, well-played by Wood Harris (2000's "Committed"). Of the other 
football player, other notables include newcomer Ryan Gosling's truly likable 
turn as Allan Bosley; Kip Pardue (2000's "Whatever It Takes") as the 
charming, peacemaking hippie Sunshine; and Ethan Suplee, effective as the 
overweight Lastik, who has no known future after graduation. As Gerry's 
caring, but prejudiced girlfriend, Kate Bosworth (1998's "The Horse 
Whisperer") makes a minor impression with her few touching scenes in the 
second half, and Hayden Panettiere (1999's "Message in a Bottle"), as 
Assistant Coach Yoast's determined and precocious 9-year-old daughter, 
Cheryl, who narrates the picture as an adult, is appropriately precocious, 
delicately balancing her childish innocence with a wise-beyond-her-years 
dedication to her father's profession.
As the two central figures, Denzel Washington (1999's "The Hurricane") can do 
no wrong, and his portrayal of the rough-edged Boone, who often hides his 
warmer, more caring side, is right on the mark. Meanwhile, Will Patton 
(2000's "Gone in Sixty Seconds"), too often underutilized in films, brings a 
heartfelt realism to his fully written role of Yoast.
Overlooking a decidedly unnecessary wraparound sequence set in 1981, ten 
years after the central action, "Remember the Titans" is a motion picture 
that, for the first time in several years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (1998's 
"Armageddon," 2000's "Coyote Ugly") can be proud of. With very little 
objectionable material, it is the rarest of PG-rated films that hold the 
ability of entertaining both adults and children, who may even learn a thing 
or two in the process about the importance of character and morals within 
each given individual. "Remember the Titans" is a veritable winner.

 Remember the Titalns (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel
Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris and  Ryan Hurst. Written by Gregory
Allen Howard. Directed by Boaz Yakin.
 Any football coach with a lick of smarts should take his team - en
masse - to see "Remember the Titans."
 Not because it is a great movie -  it is very good, despite its usual
quota of sports clichÃ©s - but because it is a film that amply displays
how a team is forged and how the concept of team can overcome even the
most hardened social structures and ideologies.
 Alexandria, Va., 1971. The last vestiges of segregation are dying as
the school district is finally integrated.
At T.C. Williams High School football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has
a new assistant coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man
with years of coaching experience in South Carolina.
 Later, in a political move to appease the black community, Yoast is
demoted and Boone is named head coach, but with a codicil: His team
cannot lose one game or he will be fired.
 This situation causes tension and animosity not only among the coaching
staff, but among the players.
Boone, though, is determined to fight through these obstacles. He
surprises the black players by refusing to show them preferential
treatment. Nor will he brook any insubordination from the white players
or his assistant coaches.
 His message is simple and direct: The only colors on the football field
are those on the Titan uniform.
 He is first tested when his players board buses to ride to practice.
The white players get on one bus, blacks on another. Boone makes
everyone disembark and the buses are designated for offense and
defensive players, no matter what that player's color.
 Washington creates a towering figure in Boone. He never allows his
guard to fall, always appearing in control, self-confident, unswaying,
single-minded and ferocious in his commitment to forge one cohesive unit
from his diverse group of young men.
 And Washington accomplishes this feat without being flashy or showy. He
is steel, an uncompromising locomotive steaming over all who get in his
way, including his assistants.
 Washington's Boone is a bully, a tyrant, driving his players to the
point where they focus all their thoughts on him, forgetting their
differences and uniting in self protection.
W
 orking uneasily at first Boone and Yoast mold these young men into a
dynamic, winning team, triumphing over the town's prejudice and the
intolerance of many of the people around them.
 Patton's Yoast is a less flashy character than Washington's Boone. But
in his quiet way, he is as strong as Boone, seeing what the coach is
trying to accomplish and helping him along without calling attention to
himself.
 Patton's performance is something that should be studied by acting
students. He serves the purpose of the supporting character, which is to
advance the story without hogging the spotlight from the film's nominal
star. In this Patton succeeds wonderfully, and he deserves a best
supporting actor Oscar nomination if not the statue itself for his
portrayal.
 Two young actors also deserve recognition: Wood Harris as Julius
Campbell, leader of the black players, and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier,
the Titans' captain. Like their elders these two begin their
relationship under a cloud of distrust and suspicion.
 But they rise above their preconceived biases, forging an alliance that
puts team ahead of any personal glory.
  "Remember the Titans" is a moving, heartfelt drama. It is masterful,
packed with emotion and some humor. It is an inspiring movie that should
not be missed.

It has been said that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  Just as
surely, one also shouldn't judge a movie by its trailer - not always,
anyway.  If I had left it up to the trailer for REMEMBER THE TITANS - or
more precisely, on the sheer number of times I'd seen the same daggone
trailer before the movie was released - I might have decided not to go
see this film.
And would have missed the best movie I've seen all year.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Virginia, 1971, was not very far from Boston, race relations-wise.
Desegregation and forced busing made many Whites upset, and displaced
long-time winning White high school football Coach Yoast (Will Patton)
from his job, when what originally started out as an assistant coach
position under Yoast for Black football Coach Boone (Denzel Washington),
turned out just the opposite: Boone was to take over as head coach for
the newly-integrated Titans football team.
That team, being a microcosm of the society around it, would need to do
more than just be physically combined to be truly integrated; Yoast was
somewhat hesitant at first to be assistant coach under a person with
less experience than him, but the surrounding neighborhood, parents,
students, and others, made it clear in no uncertain terms that Boone,
and "his people", were unwanted there.  Boone, however, had other plans:
plans which included making the young Black and White athletes truly
come together as a unit, by putting them through bootcamp-type training,
enforced interracial socialization, and lots of hard work.  And maybe,
just maybe, the Titans - the student players as well as the ill-at-ease
coaching staff - could pull a victory or two out of their collective
hats, in spite of themselves.
The Upshot:
About the only thing Keanu Reeves' THE REPLACEMENTS had in common was
REMEMBER THE TITANS was that they were both football flicks; the
similarities end there, for "Titans" was everything "Replacements" was
not.  But I didn't come here to rip on The Whoa Dude; I came in praise
of Denzel Washington, a bunch of young actors (the names of whom,
unfortunately, I do not know; my apologies), and most surprisingly, two
young girls who acted their cute little butts off.
That Denzel would Give Good Show is almost a no-brainer; with the
exception of a few miscues early on (CARBON COPY, anyone?), Washington's
career has been filled with solid, and sometimes awe-inspiring,
performances.  His Coach Boone is no exception; funny at times (the
"offsides" bit near the end had me crackin' up) and almost always
intense, I would be very surprised if Washington didn't receive an Oscar
nod for this performance.
The actors making up the Titans team were also very good, though alas
too numerous to name (and get right) in this small space.  Standouts
were Ryan Hurst as team captain Gary "Jerry" Bertier, one of the first
White players to See The Light; Wood Harris as "Big Ju", one of the
first Black players to also be thus enlightened; Donald Adeosun Faison
as Petey, the "football's zero fun" character from the trailer (and even
though I'd seen that specific scene so many times, it was still funny in
its context), and Ethan Suplee as Louie Lastik, the big loveable lug -
both actors playing Funny without going overboard and playing The Clown.
Along with the soft-spoken Will Patton as the go-along-to-get-along
Coach Yoast, these actors came together in a way that made the cheering
audience I was in, really believe they became a cohesive team.
But the shocker for me came with the interplay of Hayden Panettiere as
Sheryl Yoast (Coach Yoast's daughter) and Krystin Leigh Jones as
Nikki Boone (Coach Boone's daughter).  Typically, the Cute factor in
young actors would be turned up to epic proportions in these types of
Conquering Heroes flicks, but not so here; indeed, they sparkled in
their scenes together, and were funny and heart-warming without being
overly smarmy (and Panettiere should get special recognition for
matching Washington in intensity.  She was out there!).  Young actors
like these may not be everyone's cup o' tea within sports movies, but I
very much enjoyed them.
REMEMBER THE TITANS makes no apologies for its Feel Good bent.  The
music was obviously picked for its Inspirational value, and the mending
of racial fences might've come across as too trite in a lesser movie;
certainly, it takes more than a good round of The Dozens to Bring People
Together As Brothers, though I can believe that the more sports-minded
neighbors might not let a little thing like their racist tendencies, get
in the way of Some Football! from their winning coach-neighbor.  Yes,
this was a Feel Good setup from jump.  But hey, ain't nuttin' wrong with
Feelin' Good.  Go see it, and get some Feel Good of your own.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
It's easy to pick the overt, cross-burning, white-sheet-wearing, racists
out of a crowd, point at them, and assure the viewing audience that Yes,
Those People Are Racists.  Much harder, I think, to see the
not-so-obvious, and deal with it.  Much harder, I think, to see that
racism doesn't just wear a White face, and isn't always a one-way
street.  Much harder, I think, to admit that racism will ALWAYS be there
until the mindset that creates an US versus a THEM, begins to be erased
by creating a WE.  REMEMBER THE TITANS looked at the WE for a time, in a
way that's not often shown in mainstream flicks; here's hoping that
other movies will pick up where it left off.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
For a PG-rated Disney flick, REMEMBER THE TITANS did a decent job of
addressing The Race Issue; it did lay it on too thick at times, and not
thick *enough* at others.  I've seen better attempts, but I've also seen
much worse; and at least it pinned the tail right on The Major Cause of
racial hatred: ignorance.  Think on that.  And while you're thinking, go
see this movie.  It'll make you Feel Good.
REMEMBER THE TITANS (rating: greenlight):
A field goal, a touchdown, and the extra point; REMEMBER THE TITANS is
the best movie I've seen all year.  And yes, I cried; hey, if Bryant
Gumble can cry over this flick, I can too.

"Remember the Titans" is a quality Hollywood production that handles its
tale of the forced racial integration of a Virginia high school's football team
in too black and white a manner.  Indie director Boaz Yakin ("Fresh," "A
Price Above Rubies") gets good performances from his ensemble cast, but
balances his material so evenly that no surprises are forthcoming.
When Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is overlooked for a coaching job in his 
native North Carolina because of his race, he takes a job in Alexandria,
ironically displacing the popular, winning Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton, 
"Armageddon").  Boone convinces Yoast to remain as his defensive coach and 
their clashing styles become complementary, allowing the men to gradually 
become friends.  During boot camp, Boone nails his main objective - to create 
a team in spite of hostile racial tensions.  Predictably, screenwriter Gregory 
Allen Howard frames this interlude with bus trips where the attempts of a few 
to engage the rest in song are squelshed on the way but harmonious upon return.
Indeed, there's a ying for every yang in this script.  Boone's daughter is 
prissy and feminine while Yoast's is a nine year old football prodigy/tomboy.  
The seemingly most racist black, Julius (Wood Harris, "Above the Rim") and 
white, Gerry (Ryan Hurst, "Rules of Engagement") become the closest friends.  
A long haired Californian, nicknamed Sunshine (Kip Pardue) by his teammates,
represents both the hippy and gay cultures to add additional complications to 
the racial issues.  Boone is applauded outside his home by the black population
upon his arrival, then later by his white neighbors when he leads his team to
the regional championship.  Everything's just a little too pat, including the 
musical selections which represent the era ("Spirit in the Sky," "Spill the
Win," "Call on Me").  As in "The Replacements," the team gets a song and
dance number with "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
The ensemble cast does its best to flesh out their cliched, symbolic characters.
Washington is solid as the unrelentingly tough Boone, although it's unlikely
his Oscar hopes will be satisfied with this role.  (Was his three a.m. team
march to the Gettysburg battlefield intended to remind the Academy of his
last win?)  Patton does subtle work as the widowed single dad, although his
constant strength of character doesn't allow for much in the way of change or
development.  Wood Harris moves from sullen and self reliant to warm and 
giving dependably while Hurst goes from redneck to social reformer with as
much believability as time allows.  Ethan Suplee ("American History X") is
the good-natured John Candy element with his automatic, Louisianna army brat
acceptance of his black teammates while Kip Pardue's presence 
strengthen's the 'people are all just people' theme with humor.  Good in 
smaller roles are Craig Kirkwood as 'The Rev,' Earl C. Poitier as 'Blue,'
and Ryan Gosling as Alan, the decent son of a pushy jock dad.  Hayden Panettiere
("Message in a Bottle") has the 'almost-too-precocious' quality of Hallie 
Eisenberg as Yoast's daughter Sheryl.
Camerwork by the usually terrific Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through
It") is frequently too closely inside the action, obscuring a larger, more
fully focussed point of view from the audience.  The footbal action finally
becomes exciting for the final, state championship game.  The score by Trevor
Rubin ("Armageddon") is tritely obvious.
"Remember the Titans" scores with its cast and its occasional lapses into
freshness.  The newly integrated teammates shock at the bussing riots which
occur on the first day of school mirror our own disbelief of the memory.

In the early '70s, a school in Alexandria, Virginia has just become 
integrated. That means an all black school and an all white school have 
combined and tempers are flying through the roof. Coach Boone (Denzel 
Washington) has been chosen to lead this new school's football team, 
replacing long-time and much loved Coach Yoast (Will Patton). Yoast will go 
on to become Boone's assistant coach and defensive coordinator, but that 
doesn't please him too much. Nevertheless, the two coaches decide to take 
all the prospective players out to training camp in preparation for the 
coming season. Obviously, the two races don't get along too well at first. 
Boone runs the camp like a drill sergeant, and forces players of different 
races to spend time together. The players don't react well at first, but 
slowly come together as the team's captain, Greg Bertier (Ryan Hurst), and 
his new friend Julius (Wood Harris) set an example. Camp ends, the players 
have all become friends, but can their friendship survive when they return 
to town and find nothing there has changed at all?
What is the most powerful force in a Hollywood movie? Love? Of course not, 
that's not a strong enough emotion for Hollywood. Hatred? A case could be 
made, but I don't think so. Possibly tragedy? Nope. No, the correct answer 
is schmaltz. Schmaltz so strong it tugs at the heartstrings of audiences 
everywhere and brings tears to the eyes of the most jaded film critics 
amongst us (well, except me, but I don't think I have tear ducts). You know 
the stuff I'm talking about. I'm talking about dramatic music pounding in 
your ears while statements about family and friendship are proudly brought 
to the screen. I'm talking about the sort of thing Producer Jerry 
Bruckheimer ("Con Air") is a master of. Make no mistake, "Remember the 
Titans" isn't a football movie (unfortunately), because we see very little 
actual football. It's not even yet another statement about racism 
(fortunately). It's a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, through and through. If you 
don't like having your emotions manipulated to the point where you're ready 
to cry rape, avoid the film. If, on the other hand, you're the kind of 
person who cried a river at "Armageddon", you probably don't need me to tell 
you that you should see this movie.
"Remember the Titans" does have one thing working strongly in its favor: the 
cast. Denzel Washington ("The Hurricane") leads the way, doing a great 
impersonation of George C. Scott impersonating General George S. Patton. 
Yes, Washington overdoes it at times, but during the film's rare quiet 
moments (a scene where he's reviewing plays with Yoast's daughter), he does 
an admirable job showing a man with two very different sides. Will Patton 
("Armageddon") has grown on me more and more with every film I've seen him 
in, and he continues this trend in "Remember the Titans". Patton underplays 
the role, which is a nice foil to Washington's occasional grandstanding. The 
other three stand-outs are nine year old Hayden Panettiere ("A Bug's Life") 
as Yoast's daughter; Wood Harris ("The Siege") as Julius; and the comical 
Ethan Suplee ("Road Trip") as Lastik, the only player who doesn't care one 
bit about race. Ryan Hurst ("Patch Adams") does an adequate job, but nothing 
special. The remaining cast members all do fine jobs, particularly 
considering the often painful dialogue they're given. One of my favorite 
lines was: "We aren't going to let anything, NOTHING, come between us! We're 
a team!" Ouch.
Only in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie could the problems of race relations be 
solved as easily as they are here. It turns out that all young people of 
different races need is to be yelled at by a drill sergeant, football coach, 
or whatever suitable authority figure might be handy. You think I'm joking, 
don't you? I wish I were, but the fact is, this is the sort of world 
Bruckheimer shows us in "Remember the Titans". I say Bruckheimer gives us 
these things, even those he's not the director. That's because Bruckheimer's 
legion of directors all direct in the exact same way (I've given up trying 
to tell them apart). Boaz Yakin (Ack, he wrote "The Punisher" back '89. 
How's that for a film credit?) is no exception, directing like all good 
Bruckheimer boys do. In other words, the film is frantically shot and 
chaotically choreographed, but it still manages to be quite dull. That's 
really all "Remember the Titans" is at its core: loud, frantic, predictable, 
and boring. Take the final game for example (oh come on, you knew in your 
heart it was all going to come down to a final game). It's loud, with 
players rushing about and yelling to the point where we can't understand 
anything; it's frantic, so much so in fact that I couldn't follow any of the 
action on the field; it's predictable because you know well in advance how 
it's going to end; and it's boring because we really see only a minute at 
the half, a minute in the locker room, and a minute at the end of the game. 
A game can't be interesting if we only see little bits and pieces of it.
So other than the acting, is there anything good about "Remember the 
Titans"? I suppose it depends on who you are. Being the cynical, hard-nosed 
critic I am, I don't get much enjoyment out of movies so predictable I've 
figured the ending out before the movie starts. If you like predictable, 
feel good movies you'll probably find more to like here than I did (that 
shouldn't be too hard). One last thing I want to note is the score, by 
composer Trevor Rabin ("Armageddon"). Rabin is a long time collaborator with 
Bruckheimer, and it's little surprise since the man is a master of dramatic 
music. Everything he composes swells to epic proportions at just the right 
moments. Take a scene where, uh, well every scene in the movie actually. 
Washington makes a dramatic speech (like his painfully bad one at 
Gettysburg); the camera pans slowly over the awed faces of his students; the 
camera flashes to the sun shining through dark clouds; the music swells high 
and our spirits are meant to soar. I, meanwhile, am rapidly jotting down 
notes about feelings of nausea sweeping over me. "Remember the Titans" runs 
far too long at 113 minutes. I'd recommend it to fans of cheesy, 
predictable, dramatic movies; or to any avid Bruckheimer devotees, and give 
it two and a half out of five stars.

Jerry Bruckheimer is one of those producers who surprise me from time to 
time.  He can come up with over-the-top stuff like Top Gun, utter garbage 
like Days of Thunder, and then he has those brilliant moments where he 
produces marvelously watchable movies like The Rock and Crimson 
Tide.  Remember the Titans falls into the last category, a marvelously 
watchable and entertaining film out of the Bruckheimer production stalls.
Remember the Titans takes place in 1971.  It is a movie that uses football 
as the backdrop for a story about race relations.  A new football coach 
moves into Alexandria, Va.  This coach, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), is 
part of an integration program in Alexandria.  As events take it, the 
school board replaces current coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) with Boone 
and this does not settle well.
The conflict in the movie is that of race.  The integration of the two 
major races in Alexandria causes much pain and this is shown in the 
microcosm present with the players as they go to training camp with coaches 
Boone and Yoast.  Together, the two coaches must both get their racially 
mixed team working together and also accept each other and work together to 
win.
Remember the Titans made me emotional from the get-go, something most 
movies can't do to me  even the most polished tear-jerker from Steven 
Spielberg can't do this!  The well-written script by Gregory Allen Howard 
and the steady direction by Boaz Yakin (Fresh) put me into tears by the end 
of the film.  This movie is the perfect definition of a feel-good film.
Denzel Washington and Will Patton both give excellent 
performances.  Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he 
lives up to that with his performance in Titans.  Patton who doesn't get 
enough plum roles is given a chance to really perform and he does.  The two 
performances are what nail this movie.  The other players are good also, 
though the script doesn't give us enough time to bond with all the 
players  I got a few of the players confused after a while.  But there are 
two standout performers, they are Wood Harris (as Big Ju) and Ryan Hurst 
(as Bertier).  These two performers are excellent.
Don't Miss Remember the Titans.  It will make you laugh and it'll make you 
cry.  But, in the end, Remember the Titans will make you feel good.  And 
Jerry, please produce more good movies like this.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Bradley Null
You can find the review with full credits at
http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/4273eccb750e44ab882569680006d5fc?OpenDocument
     Here's the pitch:  Take an emotional drama about the racial
conflict concerning the integration of a black high school and a white
one in the South.  Then wrap the entire plot around a hard-nosed high
school football coach (Washington) with an unorthodox style but an
uncanny ability to get the most out of his players.  As an added little
twist in this case, the old white head coach (Patton) stays on as an
assistant so we can play with a fair amount of racial conflict and power
struggle as these two egos collide, and ultimately generate a little
more emotion as they become friends.
     The last bit aside, we've all seen this movie a couple of times
before, so we know what to expect from the feel-good sentiment.  To be
sure, a lot of bigoted white folks are going to do a lot of mean things
until they slowly start to understand that we are all the same on the
inside.  And a bunch of jaded and underachieving high school athletes
will slowly learn what it is their coach is trying to teach them about
becoming men and champions.  Throw in the fat kid from the wrong side of
the tracks who finds his inspiration and a little pride along the way,
and we've got the most heartwarming film ever made.
     The only trouble with this concoction is that in trying to
concurrently satisfy these two very demanding genres -- sports story and
racial drama -- director Boaz Yakin and producers Jerry Bruckheimer and
Chad Oman felt compelled to include the same stock scenes that we've
seen before in both of these genres.  The townspeople rise up against
the outsider coach, the players who struggled under him at first come to
respect him, the white man finally realizes that he and his black
counterpart aren't that different, and of course, there's the
ever-popular brick-through-the-window of the new black family in the
neighborhood.  Of course, the filmmakers ride these powerful scenes for
all of the emotion they've got.  But ultimately, this continuous
stringing along of genre conventions weighs the film down, preventing
the filmmakers from bringing any really new elements to the table.
     Remember the Titans is based on a true story.  And thankfully so. 
If it weren't for that fact, audiences probably wouldn't buy all of
Yakin and Bruckheimer's string pulling.  As it turns out, even though
Bruckheimer, the action producer with the touch of gold, would seem
unqualified for this picture, these two manage to mine the emotional for
it's worth.  As it turns out, genre cliches turn out to be the most
powerful elements of the film, alongside the force of nature that is
Denzel Washington.  In particular, the emotional scenes of the team
coming together on the football field prove the most effective.  (If you
don't know much about football, you can identify these scenes by the
fact that they usually follow an impassioned speech by one or another
player or coach, and are always backed by an emotional rock or R&B hit
of the 60's or 70's.)
     Ironically, the occasions when the filmmakers aren't following
genre conventions (in the film's rare opportunities for originality) are
the times when the film tends to flounder the worst.  Most notably, the
subplot about a sexually ambiguous surfer-boy from California is simply
awkward and dilutes from tension at the heart of the story.  Also, the
decision to bookend the film with a funeral sequence from ten years
later is stupid and pointless.  It was unnecessary and overbearing in
films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, but here it is simply a
waste of the audience's time and attention.  You actually find yourself
wondering who is going to die and how that will tie in to the plot, only
to find out in the end that it doesn't tie in at all.
     All in all, the movie is very consistent if not overpowering. 
You've seen it all before, but the competent repackaging will manage to
tug at your heart strings anyway.  We're all suckers like that, I
guess.  And Jerry Bruckheimer knows it better than anyone.

It seems as though mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer is stretching his wings a
little this year with two follow-up films to his typical summertime macho
fest flick GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. The first was COYOTE UGLY, a T&A film
disguised as a "woman's story" (or the other way around), and the second is
this movie, a real-life drama based on the forced integration of blacks and
whites in the early 70s.
So you're probably asking yourself, "What do you mean? No T&A? No loud
booming soundtrack? No hyped-up editing jobs? Es tu, Bruckheimer?" It's sad
but true, my friends, Mr. Jerry Bruckheimer has slipped over to the other
side of filmmaking and finally decided to make a movie that actually means
something! Bravo, sir! PS: Just don't ever forget your bread and butter,
Jerry... :)
PLOT:
Based on a true story set in 1971, a black coach is hired to take over a
newly integrated football team of black and white students. The old white
coach is kept on as his assistant, while everybody from the players, to the
coaches, to the townspeople have trouble adjusting to the forced racial
integration. Racism and intolerance follow as the coach attempts to whip
everybody into shape as one team working towards the same goal.
CRITIQUE:
A well-packaged, well-acted, well-intentioned feel good movie that brings
nothing new to the table yet still manages to pull you into its wonderful
world of harmony. It is important to note that as with all films of this
nature, there is always a very fine line between sappy melodrama, selling it
all on the "TV movie of the week" mentality, and a real story with an honest
to goodness message. This film manages to ride that fine line very well for
most of the way through, primarily due to its solid cast, steady pace, no
major lulls or sermons delivered here, and Denzel Washington, who once more,
checks in with another outstanding performance. Of course, many will say
that Denzel isn't exactly stretching his acting muscles here, playing the
straight-talking leader-man once again, and surely, all of these people will
have a point. But the bottom line is the bottom line and the bottom line in
this case is that the charisma and talent combined in this one man is what
make this entire story stick together to such a greater extent, and that's
really all that matters.
Of course, the story itself is also an important one. Such extreme racial
divide still prevalent in the 70s. Who knew? Certainly not me, at least not
to this sad-sack extent (Segregated restaurants? Yikes!). And despite most
of the basic plot points of the film having been seen a thousand times
before (too many clichÃ©s to enumerate here), I was totally "into" this movie
because I cared about the people in it and the situations presented within.
Why, you might ask? Simply put, the director seems to have perfectly molded
all of the ideal elements needed to create an entertaining picture. He took
the cliches and mixed them in with a great cast. All solid actors across the
board, many of whom are given a three-dimensional quality for you to care
about. Added some needed humor, a quick pace, which may have otherwise
dulled people to death, captivating football scenes, sympathetic characters
on all sides, and ultimately, a profound message which you can't help but
root for in the end. "It's not the outside of a person that counts...it's
the inside". Sappy, right? You've heard it a million times, right? Well, so
had I, but this film still had me sogging up my nachos, an event that occurs
only once or twice every year.
Ultimately, I think this film was helped by the fact that it was based on a
true story because of that added sense of security, knowing that it all
really happened, investing more in the characters. And as per most true-life
movie tales, and my personal favorite part of all these films, an excellent
"where are they now" summary completed the presentation of this movie. I
love that! Woo-hoo! Great move, Boaz! So if you're a parent, bring the kids.
And if you're a kid, bring your parents. And if you're a jaded movie geek
just looking to rip into a movie that doesn't really offer much originality
but does more than make up for it with an outstanding cast and message, I
say...stay home. Don't ruin this one for the rest of us.

"In Virginia, high school football is a way of life," Coach Yoast's 
daughter Cheryl (Hayden Panettiere) explains to us in the introduction.  
"It's bigger than Christmas Day."   REMEMBER THE TITANS tells a 
heart-warming, true story about a championship high school football team 
in 1971.  Set against a background of racial strife when the Virginia 
high schools were starting to integrate, the movie rises several notches 
above what we've come to expect in sports movies.
Boaz Yakin  (A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES), working from a funny and moving 
script by first-time writer Gregory Allen Howard, directs the movie with 
the same precision and passion demanded of the football players in it.  
The biggest reason for its success, however, is another marvelous 
performance by Denzel Washington (HURRICANE) as Coach Boone, the new 
head coach of the just integrated T.C. Williams High Titans.  Always 
intense, Coach Boone is at once humorous and insufferable.  Most of all, 
Coach Boone is a winner who is willing to drive his team way past normal 
limits of pain and endurance.
As the ex-head coach, the dedicated but more compassionate Coach Yoast 
(Will Patton) agrees to stay on as Coach Boone's defensive coach as a 
way to keep harmony among the team and keep his white players from 
quitting in protest over his resignation.
Having played high school football in Texas under a similarly fanatical 
coach to Coach Boone, albeit a white one, I can identify with inhuman 
practices in order to win state championships.  After you win them, it's 
easy to forget the insanity required in practice to become the best.  In 
the movie, the coach puts the team through everything from 3 a.m. runs 
in the woods to forcing dehydrated players to continue to practice 
without benefit of water.  The movie, to its credit, doesn't try to 
smooth off the rough edges of Boone's prickly personality or make his 
hard-work fanaticism seem easy to follow.
Much is made in the script of the difficulty of integrating the team so 
that they play as one.  The animosity between the races starts out so 
high that it looks like they will never gel as a team.  One key white 
player even brags that he will "miss" some blocks when the blacks are 
running.  Rather than beating us to death over the head with the race 
issue in Oliver Stone fashion, the movie uses a blend of extremely funny 
comedy and sharply written drama.
The blacks in town look to Coach Boone as a savior, something he tries 
to downplay.  "I'm not Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King or the Easter 
Bunny," he tells an adoring crowd of blacks.  "I'm just a football 
coach."  Modesty, however, isn't an attribute that the coach 
demonstrates often, pushing himself as hard as he does his players.  He 
is tough on all races, arguing that to act otherwise is to do them a 
disservice.  Again and again, you have to be in awe of Washington's 
incredible talent as an actor.  I have no idea how great the real-life 
Coach Boone was, but surely his gift was nothing in comparison to 
Washington's, who brings so much charisma and drive to his every role.
Parts of the film, as when the team sings "Ain't No Mountain High 
Enough," are reminiscent of many other sports movies, especially THE 
REPLACEMENTS.  Some, however, are surprises, especially the little gay 
humor thrown in with just the right amount of ambiguity.  
Of several subplots, the best involves the two 9-year-old daughters of 
the two coaches.  Coach Yoast's daughter, Cheryl, lives and breathes 
football.  She is the team's number one fan and likes to offer strategy 
suggestions.  In contrast, Coach Boone's daughter, Nicky (Krysten Leigh 
Jones), likes dolls.  Cheryl says that Nicky "plays" with them, but 
Nicky corrects her, saying that she "accessorizes" them.  Although the 
movie's epilogue talks about what great friends the two real-life 
coaches became, it's hard to see their girls ever really overcoming the 
differences in their interests.
The football action is filmed up close so that it's hard to follow the 
game at other than a gut level.  The editing is fast paced, and the 
football hits are punishingly hard so that the movie does pump up your 
adrenaline.  Even if the filming of the action isn't quite what it could 
be, it is more than adequate to tell the story.  
By the end, we've had an entertaining, good time and have been moved by 
a fascinating story.  With a musical score of surprisingly sweeping 
grandeur, REMEMBER THE TITANS is a wonderful film that is much better 
than we have any right to expect.  Whatever you do, don't leave before 
the epilogue that tells what happened in real life to the coaches and 
many of the key players.
REMEMBER THE TITANS runs 1:53.  It is rated PG for thematic elements and 
some language and would be a great film for the entire family.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, and his twin friends, Steven and John, both 12, 
loved the movie, giving it ****, **** and *** 1/2 respectively.  They 
all mentioned how much they liked the story, especially the parts at the 
football preseason boot camp.  They found the film quite funny.

High school football rules in Virginia. But, in 1971, this
institution, this way of life, was put to the test when the local
school board was forced to integrate the high schools of Alexandria,
Virginia. To further fuel the fires, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington),
a black coach from South Carolina is brought in to replace local
legend and state Hall of Fame nominee, Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton),
as the head coach of the T.C. Williams High School football team, the
Titans. Boone's task is formidable as he takes absolute control of his
players, during volatile times, molding them into a team where respect
is more important than race in "Remember the Titans."
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have his producer credit on most
of the films coming out of Hollywood this year. "Gone in 60 Seconds"
and "The Replacements" come immediately to mind and, now, "Remember
the Titans." While "Gone in 60 Seconds" was a lot of smoke and flash
and "The Replacements" was good-hearted fun, Bruckheimer's latest is
hit-you-over-the-head inspirational tale.  Based on a true story,
"Titans" tells us about two men - Herman Boone and Bill Yoast - who
are both at an important crossroad in their lives. Boone is being set
up by the town fathers to fail as the school's head coach, while Yoast
is forced to choose between his loyalty to his team or to himself.
Coach Boone, who took the assistant coaching position when he came to
T.C.  Williams, is suddenly thrust into the number one spot to the
detriment of the man he thought he would be working for - Coach
Yoast. Herman doesn't know it, at first, but the town elders are
setting him up, along with the government-imposed school integration,
to fail. If the daunting task of integrating his team isn't difficult
enough, it is compounded, many fold, by the racial turmoil that
enfolds the city and the country. Boone's reaction is to take on the
task as absolute dictator of the Titans. He does not brook racial hate
and conflict in the ranks of the team and demands, even if the boys do
not like each other, they will respect each other unconditionally. The
message of respect, integrity and team play is repeated many times
through the film.
Bill Yoast is a man of honest integrity who stays on board the Titans'
staff as defensive coach out of loyalty to the team and, especially,
Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst). Gerry is an All-American player who has a
shining career ahead of him, a career that Coach Yoast has nurtured
him toward. While Gerry is totally opposed to the integration of the
team and the school, even challenging head coach Boone, the influence
of Bill Yoast is apparent and helps the young player to take the right
path in his life-affecting decisions. Patton brings out the gentle
understanding and strength that a man like Bill Yoast would need to
have in such an emotionally fraught social climate.
The story doesn't stop with the two lead characters. There is a
significant ensemble cast that fleshes out the team and allows the
message of the movie - integration and respect is good, racism and
hate is bad - to be played in a variety of ways. Principally, the
initial rivalry, then friendship, that develops between the leaders of
the blacks and whites on the team - Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) and
Gerry - is the catalyst that makes the team the role model for the
rest of the school and the city of Alexandria. The boys, especially
Gerry, see the wrong in segregation and begin the long, painful task
of changing the way people think. Again, more inspirational messages
on good versus bad.
The integration process begins, for the team, when one kid, Lewis
Lastik (Ethan Suplee), a poor white kid who doesn't give a hoot about
race or prejudice, volunteers for the team. He just wants to tackle
people and have some fun and acts as the first bridge between the
black and white players. To make sure we, the audience, understand the
film's simple, straightforward message, a friendship is also formed
between the two coaches daughters. Sheryl Yoast (Hayden Panettiere) is
a tomboy who loves football and knows more about the game and her
beloved Titans than most of the adults around her. Nicky Boone
(Krystin Leigh Jones), a prim and proper young lady, is as different
from Sheryl as oil is to water. Despite their differences - personal,
not racial - they become fast friends and are yet another example of
the goodness of racial harmony and acceptance of people's differences.
Acting is uniformly solid throughout. Washington is good, as usual,
but Will Patton is better in his powerful, yet subtle, portrayal of
the humane and intelligent Bill Yoast. While Yoast does not stray far
from his path of personal integrity, there is nuance and conflict in
the performance that makes Patton's perf a fine character study of an
interesting, complex man.  
The kids masking up the team are a good collection of newcomers who
are given a chance to create real people out of their
characters. Hurst, as Gerry, get the most of the limelight in his role
as a true leader, a young man who, with Yoast and Boone's influence,
is destined to be great, no matter what life dishes out to him. Wood
Harris as Julius, rival then best friend to Gerry, isn't given the
floor as much as Hurst but still does a good job in showing that the
man he was afraid of is, in fact, his brother. Kip Pardue as
Californian transplant nicknamed Sunshine, Donald Faison as the lost
then found Petey, and comic relief Suplee help give the background
characters some personality.
Production is consistent with the acting quality, with attention paid
to the circa-1971 period details - although I question that the use of
mouth guards had come in to being for high school players at that
time. I may be wrong.  Most of the action is on the field, in the
locker room or at the school, so town locales are less significant but
still well displayed. The tunes use during the film are a collection,
almost a mishmash, of the music of that time. Prominent are the
overused "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" (also covered by the team, of
course), "I Heard It Through The Grapevine," "Spirit In The Sky"
(another well-worn piece), Eric Burdon & WAR's "Spill The Wine,"
"House of the Rising Sun" and The Temptations' "Superstar," among
others. "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" is used as a gospel ballad,
replacing "Amazing Grace" (which is also sung by the team members) as
the inspirational funeral tune.
If "Remember the Titans" weren't so relentless in hammering its
messages home - I began to physically react every time the story
tackles you with the good is good and bad is bad theme - it may have
been a better film. The bold statement of "based on a true story" at
the beginning precludes the taking of major liberties by the
filmmakers. As such, it is relegated to being a well made, well
intentioned inspirational "message movie" that not only wears its
heart on its sleeve, it beats you to death with it. I got the point in
the first few minutes.
Note Will Patton's performance at year's end. I give "Remember the
Titans" a B-.

The title of Boaz Yakin's film surfaces when one of the coaches tells his 
team to play hard, to make the other team never forget the night they 
scrapped with the Titans from T.C. Williams High School from Alexandria, 
Virginia.  It's an inspiring moment, as the Titans indeed come back and 
teach their opponents many lessons in the science of the gridiron.  It's not 
a very original moment, however.
The premise of the piece is a promising and even an important one.  We watch 
another episode in the long story of the integration of American schools.  
Seventeen years have passed since Brown vs. Board of Education Â it's 1971 Â 
and forced busing has a lot of parents (and in imitation of this prejudice) 
children outraged.  The film does not go into specifics; for example, we 
never discover that it was three schools (one with a largely white 
enrollment, two with largely African American enrollments) that merged.  But 
backstories stay undeveloped, and we quickly pick up on the tension caused 
by changes on the coaching staff.
Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) has come from North Carolina, and is 
installed as head coach.  Ousted from his position, Coach Yoast (Will 
Patton) says he'll move on, but changes his mind when his white players 
threaten to sit out the season.  It's a political move, we find out, and the 
school board apparently intends to reinstall Yoast as chief if Boone loses 
even one game.  So one conflict is established Â the one among the coaches 
and their assistants.  (Let me inject here that I've taught high school 
myself for a number of years, and have never seen a team with only three 
assistant coaches: Boone and Yoast each have only one disciple.)
The major problems come from the racial tension at football camp.  Some of 
the best scenes hinge on Coach Boone's determination to break the barriers 
of hate separating these youths.  Outstanding in their performances are Wood 
Harris playing Julius, and Ryan Hurst playing Bertier, the All-American 
linebacker.  We know they are traveling a course that will intersect in 
friendship, but still we eat up the fights they cause and cause to stop.  
Though both actors look much too old for high schoolers, they create a level 
of believability, and they make us want to watch them in other vehicles.
It takes a good 45 minutes before we see any action in the regular season 
football games.  But by this time, the characters are well developed,  the 
conflicts clear.  Another item that diverges from the source story is that 
the Titans pushed many of their foes right off the field, blew them off the 
scoreboard.  Here most of the games are portrayed as close contests.  I was 
glad that the plot does not rely too heavily on game action;  there's enough 
of it here, but we still see the players and coaches plenty off the field.  
And they are fighting the battles of prejudice wherever they go: the players 
often trying to mediate in school fights, the coaches coping with political 
hijinks and boardroom betrayals.
Denzel Washington is one of the most reliable actors in American movies.  
What he's in will probably succeed, as he does not have much trouble taking 
on the focus of the narrative.  Though Washington still does not command the 
money taken home by white superstars, he is able to match the intensity and 
presence of anyone opposite him.  I was also glad to see Will Patton 
depicting such a multi-faceted character.  His Yoast actually grows, and we 
view him as a caring family man as well as conflicted coach.
Events late in the film tend to distract us from the story of race and 
football.  The end does not dive into downright sappiness, but the story 
veers a little and staggers on a bit too long.  The music was very engaging 
Â the soundtrack will doubtless play in the living rooms of thousands of 
fans of oldies.  And about an hour into the playing time, the editing cuts 
loose into a cool triptych of montages.
On the whole, REMEMBER THE TITANS pleases fans of football and racial 
justice alike, though it fails to use fresh devices to put even more points 
up on the board.

"I'm not the answer to your prayers. I'm not Martin Luther King ... I'm 
just a football coach." 
1971 Virginia is in for a rude awakening, Denzel Washington takes over 
as the nation's first black high school head coach. Can the old coach 
tolerate working under him? With busing protesters tossing stones the 
first day of school, can the white and black players learn to play as a 
team instead of an angry mob? Can the town reconcile the racial 
tensions? 
Though all of the dialogue is poignant, some of it is soaked onto the 
film a little thick -- the youngest cast member pushing the oversell 
envelope. But, schmaltz is all the fault I can find with this extremely 
well paced, meaty film. Like "Meet the Parents," these filmmakers had so 
much to put into the film, they cut anything that wasn't immediately 
pertinent. Washington is high powered, as is just about everyone else in 
this film (Harris, Hurst, Patton!). "Titans" is full of people to like 
... and to learn to like. 
Denzel plays the hard guy that won't patronize any part of weakness, 
"You fumble the football and I will break my foot off in your John Brown 
hind parts ... and then you'll run a mile!" 
The film is a lot about character and a little about football. Not a 
single boring, slow, or unnecessary second. I loved it.

   I don't recall hearing the "n" word spoken in hostility by a
white guy in the past twenty years.  In fact according to some
sociologists, there are white teens and college people in
various sections of the country who seem to want to be black. 
They imitate clothing fashions and colloquial speech of young
African-Americans and, believe-it-or-not, statistics prove that
whites snap up hip-hop CD's in greater numbers than blacks. 
This is not to say that racism is dead in the U.S. but if you
introduce a kid of any race to "Remember the Titans," he
simply would not believe what he sees.  Opening in 1971,
Boaz Yakin's movie from a script by Gregory Allen Howard
based on true incidents (and produced, strangely enough, by
a now socially conscious Jerry Bruckheimer), hones in on the
outright animosity shown by some whites in an Alexandria,
Virginia school district when their school and most particularly
their coaching staff is ordered integrated by the school board. 
By the time school opens in September, the kids of both
races seemed to be heading to their classes peaceably
enough but the enraged parents, carrying picket signs
showing their opposition to forced busing, were the
troublemakers--not the youngsters.
   "Remember the Titans" deals with a situation that occurred
just months prior to the commencement of the school year
when Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is brought up from
South Carolina, appointed as head coach to the football team
of T.C. William High School, thus knocking successful white
coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) into a subordinate position. 
Along with Boone, a company of black students were being
integrated into this southern institution, so that at the
beginning of summer vacation, desegregation was being put
to the test.  Not only was the white team threatened by the
black football players against whom they would have to
compete to keep their varsity uniforms: they were furious that
Yoast, a candidate for the hall of fame, was downgraded by a
newcomer.  Boone, as determined as a Marine boot-camp
instructor to get his boys into shape, even to court perfection,
leads them on a bus trip to a camp in Gettysburg, PA where
he would customarily wake them up at three in the morning
and penalize anyone who fumbled the ball by making him run
a mile.
   Of course "Remember the Titans" is not about football,
because if it were, it could not possibly compete with just
about any pro game that creates football widows around the
country every Sunday during the season.  Like every other
sports picture, "Titans" uses sport as a metaphor for life, or at
least for mankind-in-miniature, in this case as a testing
ground for racial harmony.  While racial melees break out
from time to time among the boys from the team known as
the Titans, Boone is determined to meld the disparate
groups, even forcing them to room together and giving them
an assignment to ask each other about their families and
their lives.  
   "Remember the Titans" is one of those films that could
easily be dismissed as a generic feel-good crowd-pleaser, the
sort that inevitably ends with your team winning in the final
seconds of play and all members of the team--and by
extension the school--getting together in peace and harmony. 
Yet despite the swelling music that virtually forces tears to
our eyes and lumps to our throats, and notwithstanding at
least one pretentious speech made by the head coach to
compete with no less than the Gettysburg Address itself, the
movie is so well-acted, with Will Patton's performance in
particular so quietly engaging, that we have to give the
ensemble credit for turning in an enjoyable and heartwarming
film.  
   Sure, Yakin throws in the obligatory precocious kid to win
over the parents in the audience--in this case the amazing
nine-year-old daughter of Coach Yoast, Sheryl (Hayden
Panettiere) who knows more about football than any of the
men in the school.  And sure, we get the recycled pop tunes
and the particular individuals who acquire self-esteem such
as the overweight Lewis Lastik (Ethan Suplee)--who from the
start doesn't give a fig what his teammates' race might be but
heads right over and sits down to lunch with the black teens. 
But darned if this picture--shot in Georgia without a single
spectacular football play photographed with the intensity of an
ordinary televised Sunday game--doesn't thoroughly entertain
even while devoid of a single four-letter word.

"Remember the Titans" is a sports film that shares a number of
similarities with "Hoosiers." Both feature well-respected actors and
talented newcomers in stories based on fact. Both showcase fiery coaches
whose jobs are on the line. Both are loaded with picturesque scenery and
stirring music. And both films succeed despite formulaic plotlines that,
on paper, seem impossibly hokey.
The comparisons end there. While "Remember the Titans" is surprisingly
effective, its cheese factor is too high for it to be in the same league
as a gem like "Hoosiers." Still, the production has much to appreciate.
Writer Gregory Allen Howard got the idea for the film after moving from
Los Angeles back to his hometown of Alexandria, Virginia. Living just
outside the Washington D.C. beltway, he noticed something wonderful
about race relations in his city. "It's socially integrated in a way I'd
never seen," he stated. "Movie theaters, restaurants, neighborhoods, I
couldn't understand why. Why here and almost nowhere else? I started
asking around and I kept hearing about this high school football team. I
think it was my barber who first told me about the Titans and these two
coaches. I couldn't imagine that a high school team could so effect an
entire town. Some say they saved the city."
Howard's research brought him to a pair of men who made a difference
(SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals plot points that will surprise no
one). In 1971, the Alexandria school board was forced to integrate an
all-black school with an all-white school. The fireworks begin when Bill
Yoast (Will Patton), head coach of the T.C. Williams High Titans, is
replaced by Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a coach brought in from
South Carolina. The decision infuriates local fans unable to understand
why a man with seniority, a terrific reputation and a pending spot in
the Hall of Fame would be treated so shabbily.
Yoast refuses to accept a position as an assistant until he learns that
his entire team plans to boycott the season. Grudgingly, he signs on,
determined to support his boys while maintaining a healthy distance from
his successor.
Where Yoast is a laid-back sort, Boone turns out to be a ball of fire.
Taking advantage of the summer, he puts the boys through an intense boot
camp, shouting things like "Football is not fun" and "Football is not a
democracy, it's a dictatorship" to his smoldering team of big, surly
black and white athletes. He forces them to get to know one another, a
process designed to teach the folly of prejudice. Gradually, the
majority comes around and, by the end of summer, the young men bond into
a cohesive group.
Then the school year starts and the team realizes that the town does not
share their newfound sense of unity. Protesters line the streets on
opening day, loudly voicing their fury over bussing. Football players
socializing on weekends with their new friends are met with glares and
insults from classmates repulsed by racial intermixing. Coach Boone gets
a brick chucked through his window.
Can the boys' friendships withstand the overt bigotry? Will Boone and
Yoast make nice? Can Boone save his job by leading the team to a winning
season? Is there anyone who doesn't know the answers to these questions?
(END SPOILER ALERT)
As with any film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the man who inflicted
"Armageddon" and "Coyote Ugly" on a world that never did him any harm,
"Remember the Titans" suffers from an overly processed feel. In fact,
there are numerous moments coated with cinematic Velvetta, all melted
and gooey. How do the racially diverse teammates bond? By singing a
golden oldie together, of course. The "let's affirm our relationship by
belting out a Motown tune" syndrome, previously confined to chick
flicks, is now infecting action movies as well. The football team does
three, count 'em, three musical numbers Â in a movie about racism! When
the boys aren't singing, an overbearing score oozes over scenes,
determined to make sure we understand exactly how to emotionally
respond.
Nearly as annoying is Hayden Panettiere in the role of Yoast's
precocious 9-year-old kid, Sheryl. One of the reasons the real-life
Yoast participated in this project was to see his daughter, who died of
a heart attack at 34, portrayed on-screen. His sentiment is
understandable, but I wonder if he found Panettiere's stilted
performance a fitting tribute.
Thankfully, the rest of the cast delivers. Denzel Washington is solid,
giving just the right amount of shading to his drill instructor persona.
Will Patton contributes a nicely detailed turn as well, but the real
stars of the film are the boys, particularly Wood Harris as quarterback
Julius "Big Ju" Campbell and Ryan Hurst, who is terrific as team captain
Gerry Bertier.
"Remember the Titans" shines despite its problem areas, thanks to strong
casting and the sincerity of Gregory Allen Howard's screenplay. While
the story ends exactly the way you expect it to end, Howard makes sure
you see that, even at the height of celebration, bigots still stand on
the sidelines. Even Jerry Bruckheimer's melted Velveeta can't cover them
up.

Denzel Washington's latest picture is Â surprise Â another `Denzel
against the world' film.  In the last five years, the
forty-five-year-old actor has been in seven films where he has played
either a cop, a military man or the victim of some horrible racial
injustice.  In each of these films, Denzel's straight-laced character
has to fight an uphill battle against a seemingly insurmountable force.
It's getting pretty tired.  Aren't there any juicy bad guy roles he can
play?
Luckily, Denzel's fondness for tackling only likeable roles doesn't
hamper his latest picture too badly.  In Remember the Titans, which was
based on a true story, Mr. Washington plays the head football coach of a
recently integrated school in the early seventies.  He has to contend
with the bigoted crackers in his new town, as well as his racially
divided team.
Set in Alexandria, Virginia in summer of 1971, Titans begins be showing
the racial tension caused by recent laws forbidding segregation.  For
the upcoming school year, Alexandria combined three local high schools
into one new integrated location Â T.C. Williams High.  Coach Boone
(Washington, The Hurricane), who was a winning football instructor in
North Carolina, was reassigned to T.C. William's head coaching position
by the local school board (how a local school board can reassign a coach
from a different state is beyond me).
Coach Yoast (Will Patton, Gone in 60 Seconds) is the lame duck coach of
the T.C. William Titans (how a new school can have an existing coach is
also beyond me).  He's also a successful instructor of the game and a
beloved member of the community, but still loses his job to what must
have been one of the earliest cases of affirmative action.  It quickly
becomes clear that the football program will be a racially divided, with
Boone and the black players on one side, and Yoast and the white players
on the other.
But Coach Boone isn't just a football coach.  He's also an apparent
expert in race relations, who marched with Martin Luther King and stood
toe to toe with the Klan.  After an intensive summer training camp,
Boone has his Titan players begin working together as a team after
dividing them by offense and defense, instead of by race.  After weeks
of hating each other, the Titans inexplicably seem to unite over a
Marvin Gaye song and a contest where they rank out each other's moms.
When the school year finally starts, T.C. Williams is still bursting
with racial tension.  Coach Boone finds out that he'll be fired if he
loses one game, and the Titans begin their improbable run toward the
state championship.  Improbable, that is, if you've never seen an
inspirational sport film in your life.
Among the problems already listed above, it seemed odd for Titans to
never bring up Viet Nam.  The film has a really hokey epilogue, but I
guess you can't fault it if it's based on a true story.  Of the Titan
players, Donald Faison (Felicity) stands out as the loud-mouthed running
back-turned-defensive back.  Also of note is the performance of Hayden
Panettiere (The Guiding Light), who plays the precocious nine-year-old
daughter of Coach Yoast.  Washington and Patton capably handle their
roles, but there isn't much to them, other than a few funny one-liners.
Titans was directed by Boaz Yakin (A Price Above Rubies) and is the
writing debut of Gregory Allen Howard.  The film was produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer, who generally only makes big, noisy summer pictures that
make a ton of money.  Titans games scenes are pretty well-done, thanks
to the snappy editing of Philippe Rousselot (Random Hearts).  Yes'
Trevor Rabin (a Bruckheimer staple) provides an annoying, heavy-handed
score that lets you know when you're supposed to feel various emotions.
1:53 Â PG for mild adult language - mostly racial epithets

Sports movies, with their clearly definable elements of winning and 
losing, lay out a simple blueprint for our emotions. We identify with 
the protagonist, and then cheer when he wins. It's fun, it's easy, and 
anyone can play.
There's all of that in Remember the Titans, a visceral football movie 
based on the true story of the forced integration of an Alexandria, Va. 
High school in 1971. It's a feel-good, feel-bad, feel-good roller 
coaster ride, replete with the familiar signposts of the genre. But it's 
not really about football. It's about race relations, and there are 
plenty of familiar signposts from that route as well. What is 
surprising, then, is what a terrific movie it turns out to be.
How accurate it is we can only guess. But Alexandria's T.C. Williams 
High School was integrated in the fall of 1971, and its popular white 
football coach was replaced with a black man. Coach Yoast (Will Patton) 
agreed to stay on as an assistant under Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), 
a decision which may have been motivated by an understanding that the 
minute Boone stumbled, the Board would kick him out on his unpopular 
black ass. The movie isn't clear whether Yoast is in on this this from 
the start, but it's not far from everyone's mind.
Boone is not a man who requires any such motivation to succeed. He's a 
tough leader who demands perfection from everyone, black and white, with 
the tyranny of a marine drill sergeant. And he understands that a 
football team beset by racial division is a losing football team. So his 
away-from-home preseason camp is devoted to forcing his black and white 
players to accept each other as much as it is to teaching football and 
fitness. A highlight is a brutal predawn run through the woods which 
ends in the early morning mists of the battlefield at Gettysburgh, where 
the coach delivers a moving inspirational speech.
Bonding a bunch of kids with a common goal is one thing. Translating it 
to the community is another. Virginia in the early seventies was a place 
with a deep-seated perspective on the mixing of races; back from camp 
and in the real world, the integrated Titans have to test their 
hard-earned brotherhood in the fires of the bigotry of their families 
and friends.
Success is measured the old-fashioned way, one perfect season at a time. 
One wonders what the effect of a few tough losses would have been on the 
history of integration in Northern Virginia. But this is a movie, and 
there are certain conventions to be followed. I don't mind a movie that 
pushes my buttons if it pushes them well, and this pushes them like E. 
Power Biggs hitting the stops on a church organ.
There's plenty of credit to go around, starting with another commanding 
performance by Washington and a smart, tough assist from Patton and a 
likable cast of young actor/athletes. And it would be a crime not to 
single out young Hayden Panettiere as Yoast's pint-sized, 
football-obsessed daughter. Pulling the strings masterfully are 
screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard and director Boaz Yakin (Fresh). And 
don't forget producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who finally hits after two duds 
this year, a record that would have had him out on his white ass if he'd 
been coaching the Titans.

Directed by Boaz Yakin. Screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard. Starring
Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Hayden Panettiere. Running time: 121
minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 11th, 2000.
"Remember The Titans" is neither a great sports movie, nor a great movie
about race relations. Like Denzel Washington's last based-on-reality
movie, "The Hurricane", "Remember The Titans" is a simplified 
Hollywoodisation of true-life events, prettied up for the big screen. But
unlike "The Hurricane", "Titans" manages to maintain its integrity
throughout the proceedings, resulting in a superior overall product which,
while not the Oscar contender some have touted, is certainly worth the 
price of admission.
The setting is Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Due to the racial 
integration of the formerly all-white high school where he coaches 
football, Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has been demoted to serve under a new
black coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). He stays on only to ensure
that his white players do not boycott the season, thereby ruining their
college eligibility. Boone, meanwhile, has been installed purely as a
public relations move, with the school board ready to yank him out of his
job as soon as his team -- the Titans -- loses so much as one game.
The result is a series of fairly predictable set pieces. There are the two
leaders of their respective group of players -- Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst)
amongst the white students and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) amongst the
black -- who are first enemies, then grudging allies. There is the new
white player who does not subscribe to Alexandria's racial turmoil, and
the veteran Titan who refuses to accept the integrated team. There is the
inevitable growth of respect between Boone and Yoast, building up to a
crucial moment in the team's season. And, of course, there is the football
aspect of the film which, unsurprisingly, all hinges on a final climactic
game.
There is little new in "Remember The Titans" -- familiar buttons are
pushed both in terms of the race plotline and the football story -- but it
is at least handled well by screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard. Howard
keeps the tone of the story light without sugarcoating the racial tension
on which it hinges. There is irrefutable unpleasantness here, and not all
of it is resolved comfortably; consider a scene in which one of the white
players new to Alexandria convinces two of his black teammates to come
into a restaurant which refuses to serve African-Americans. But the
indisputable thrust of the film is toward racial harmony, and the final
outcome is sure to leave audiences smiling as they exit the theatre. 
"Remember The Titans" is a feel-good movie in every respect, and serious
scenes such as the preceding quickly give way to more upbeat fare.
Fortunately, even this material is well-scripted and amusing, such as an
increasingly hilarious game of one-upsmanship in the Titans' locker
room. Howard also mixes in some genuinely intriguing and moving subplots,
including one in which Bertier must choose between his football team and
his girlfriend (Kate Bosworth), who cannot bring herself to accept her
black schoolmates. Howard and director Boaz Yakin are fortunately able to
tone down the unavoidable schmaltz factor, keeping such scenes as the
resolution to the Bosworth subplot pointed and underplayed.
Yakin handles the directorial reins capably, and the material on the
football field is executed with particular skill, neither belabored nor
difficult to follow. He demonstrates wisdom in not exaggerating scenes
unnecessarily; a sequence at Gettysburg, for example, could have been
milked for all the patriotic, egalitarian fervour it was worth, but
instead Yakin keeps it subdued, almost subtle.
He is aided in this endeavour by both his lead actors, who concentrate on
their characters as people rather than representatives of societal
ideologies. There is an excellent scene toward the start of the movie
where Boone refuses to take Yoast's job away from him, because that sort
of thing was done to him at his old school. But when a throng of
African-Americans shows up at his doorstep to cheer him on in his new
position, Boone is forced to change his mind and coach the team despite
his personal preferences. Boone is not a noble campaigner for black 
rights, but rather a black man who finds such a role thrust upon him. 
Washington delivers a very even performance, accepting both Boone's
defects and his virtues.
Similarly, Patton plays Yoast as neither a stubborn redneck nor a
bleeding-heart liberal. His transition from being passively against the
integration of his high school to learning to respect African-Americans is
handled smoothly and without show. For example, Yoast's decision to let
his daughter Sheryl (Hayden Panettiere) stay at the Boones' house is not
treated as an earthshattering event, but is instead relayed almost
off-handedly, in a conversation with another coach. Indeed, Patton's
performance may eclipse even Washington's. Although Washington handles his
part with unsurprising skill, Patton has to convey a far greater range, as
Yoast makes the gradual transition from (broadly speaking) villain to
hero.
Yakin coaxes workmanlike portrayals from the rest of his cast, who are
mostly stuck in typical, formulaic roles: the jovial fat guy, the jock,
the religious guy, and so forth. "Remember The Titans" is sadly 
unambitious on this front. Very little true conflict is uncorked between
the characters, and is instead left to fester mostly with 
briefly-appearing cameo parts -- a corrupt referee, a local Hall of Fame
president, the aforementioned restaurant owner. When there is disagreement
amongst the Titans, it is, in general, easily dealt with.
This leaves the impression that bringing the team together wasn't much
work at all. This was likely not Yakin and Howard's intent, as it somewhat
undermines the tension of the film's opening hour. Indeed, viewers are
left wondering just why it took the rest of Alexandria so long to follow
suit. And while, in principle, this is a very valid question, the sad
truth is that reality is rarely so accommodating, and I expect the real
Titans did not come together quite as smoothly as this depiction would
suggest. It only works that way in the movies.

Susan Granger's review of "REMEMBER THE TITANS" (Walt Disney Pictures)
  Back in 1971, when high school football was everything to
the residents of Alexandria, Virginia, local officials were forced to
integrate the schools and hire a black man, Herman Boone, as head
coach of the T.C. Williams Titans. First, he and the older, beloved
white coach with more seniority, Bill Yoast, had to learn to work
together. Then they were faced with molding a group of rebellious
teenage boys into a winning team while teaching them valuable lessons
about becoming men. Their respect, friendship and determination healed
a town torn by fear, ignorance and prejudice. Based on a true story,
scripted by Gregory Allen Howard, first-time director Boaz Yakin
propels the gradual process of discovery and bonding among the
participants. A highlight is the pre-dawn cross-country run,
culminating at the Gettysburg Battlefield, where Boone notes: "50,000
men died on this same field fighting the same battle we are still
fighting today...If we don't come together on this hallowed ground, we
too will be destroyed." Denzel Washington radiates intensity as the
tough-yet-fair taskmaster Boone, who divides his enraged players into
color-blind squads, offense and defense, at training camp, saying,
"football is about controlling that anger, harnessing that aggression
to achieve perfection," reminding them how, in mythology, the titans
were greater than the gods. Bill Patton strikes a different note as
the gentle, quiet, taciturn Yoast with his precocious, outspoken,
football-obsessed daughter (Hayden Panettiere) who provides comic
relief. What distinguishes this film is its honesty, a credit to the
young ensemble actor/players. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Remember the Titans" is an inspirational 8, an emotionally-uplifting
testament to the power of the human spirit.
