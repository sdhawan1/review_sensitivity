     Well, since I see everyone else writing their reviews, I guess
I'll add my Midwestern perspective to the list since I saw an awful lot
of movies this summer (for me--at least).  So here are the summer
reviews (in more or less descending order) according to SJT:
SPEED (****+)
=============
     This movie surprised and awed me.  It surprised me because I am far
from Keanu Reaves's biggest fan and I usually detest the intellectual
level of action films.  However, it awed me because it was able to
overcome all of my preliminary judgements and thoroughly entertain me.
This was a movie that I was strapped into my seat to and could not move
or breathe until it was over.  It brilliantly strung together three
tense and gripping action sequences along with a decent story.  Dennis
Hopper plays one of the most memorable villains in the movies this year
with a roll full of hilarious one-liners and maniacal laughter.  The
humor is also spread throughout with Sandra Bullock and Reaves.  The
action scenes are magnified by tense and enthralling music as well.
All in all, one of the best action movies ever made and the year's best
entertainment.
THE LION KING (****+)
=====================
     Another Disney classic--far better than ALADDIN and even BEAUTY
AND THE BEAST.  The animation is incredible and the music is
spellbinding--but that's to be expected from Disney.  What makes this
movie better is that, unlike ALADDIN where one character's voice made
the movie, The Lion King provides a wide array of memorable and
captivating characters.  Kids can name at least seven or eight
characters in this flick where as in ALADDIN or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,
there were fewer.  The second thing is that this isn't a classic story
like the other Disney movies.  This is a relatively new tale and
educates about the circle of life--i.e., it is more realistic than the
fairy tales and is still every bit as entertaining.  A true classic.
THE CLIENT (****)
=================
     This is, by far, the closest and best adaptation of Grisham's
books.  The three main characters in this story are spectacular.  Susan
Sarandon should (but probably won't) receive an Oscar nomination for a
role that she played with passion and heart.  Tommy Lee was every bit
as entertaining as in the Fugitive, but the true star of this flick is
young Brad Renfro.  He is absolutely amazing as Mark Sway and it is
unbelievable that this is his acting debut.  The acting truly makes
this movie special.  The story is pretty good until the end, where
(like most Grisham books) the story wears thin because it simply can
not keep pace with the breakneck beginnings), but the characters save
it.  This is a rich adaptation with perfect casting.  Grisham beats
Clancy this year.
FORREST GUMP (****)
===================
     An outstanding movie with one flaw--it wears on a bit at the end.
The running sequence could have been cut by 5 minutes and still been
effective (when it got to the smiley face "Have a Nice Day" part, it
went too far--I gagged).  But overall, it is a wonderful recap of
America's transition from the idealistic 50's into the "me first"
90's.  Tom Hanks is good, but is overshadowed by Sinese as his
lieutenant--who should win an Oscar for supporting actor.  Again, great
music and a wonderful job of weaving in America's main events in the
declining road of history with the simple and innocent life of Forrest
Gump.  An original and brilliant movie.
THE MASK (****)
===============
     This was the second surprise of the summer (after SPEED) because,
while I admired Carrey's work from the early "In Living Color" days, I
found ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE atrocious.  THE MASK, however, had a
much better story, music and supporting cast.  No, it will not win any
Oscars for acting or writing (but maybe for special effects), but it
will make you laugh.  The summer's funniest film.
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (*** 1/2)
================================
     A sorta-true fairy tale comes to life in this magical and sweet
film.  It's not as mushy as SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and makes more
important points--such as you can simply enjoy a person's company as a
companion.  Nicholas Cage and Bridget Fonda are enchanting and match up
perfectly.  Rosie Perez is hilarious and wicked at the same time.  It's
too bad this film didn't do so well because it was a great one.
TRUE LIES (*** 1/2)
===================
     Another shock because I don't like Aaahnold much either.  He had
too many lines in this movie (i.e., more than one) and it took a major
detour for the middle third of the film, yet it still came out well.
The main reason: Tom Arnold.  He was the jester in this film but was
perfect as it--a true entertainer.  Roseanne who?  Jamie Lee Curtis also
provides Aaahnold with his toughest female counterpart--although she
doesn't hit full stride until the end.  Oh yes, the part where the gun
fell down the stairs and kills all hundred bad guys in the vicinity
made me gag--but I still liked this film.
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (***)
==============================
     A disappointment.  This movie gets long, rambly and loses its
focus.  The ending is also a bit far fetched (I'm sure every top CIA
desk man goes right into the danger zone and slugs it out with the bad
guy).  The action pales in comparison to PATRIOT GAMES and,
unfortunately, so does the directing.  Tom Clancy's core is there, and
that along with Harrison Ford save most of this film, but the director
tore this apart and added long-winded and pointless dribble between the
basic skeleton of a story by Clancy.  Some fine moments, but there is
far too much in between.
I LOVE TROUBLE (*** or *--depending on end)
THE FLINTSTONES (** 1/2)
========================
     This film has remarkable scenery and it's cute how they fit our
modern contraptions (like a garbage disposal or airplane) into dino
times--but it lacks acting and plot.  Goodman is acceptable as Fred,
but midway through the movie, I wanted to take Bam Bam's club and whack
Barney (Rick Moranis) on the head and wipe that stupid looking grin or
smirk off his face!  Kyle McLaughlin is the sole exception, turning in a
devilish performance as the villain, but overall it was overhyped.
BLOWN AWAY (**)
===============
     This one was a dud.  So much potential wasted.  This movie started
out well, with a good storyline and some fine actors.  However, they
soon became lost in a series of explosions that continued to decrease
in point and effect.  By the end, it is just a hollow action flick with
a very letdown ending (he rips the head off the toy and the bomb just
goes silent??? Puhleeze!) and leaves the audience wondering--where did
this great start of a movie go???
CITY SLICKERS II (***)--Not as funny or well written as the original,
but Billy Crystal can still draw a laugh (unlike Eddie Murphy)
WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (*** 1/2)--A great movie and a superb acting
job by Meg Ryan.  If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination, then life's
not fair.
FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (****)--A delightful and original movie
that will have you in stitches and crying as well.  A treat!
QUIZ SHOW (****)--This movie started a bit slow for me, but when it
caught on, it was captivating.  Ralph Fiennes should have another Oscar
nomination coming his way and the film will also get nominated.
John Turturro is humorous as the former champ who takes the dive and
once you get by the annoying accent, Rob Morrow does a fine job as the
investigator.  Both may have supporting Oscar nominations.  Maybe it's
just that I'm a sucker for true stories on the screen, but I was
thoroughly enthralled by this film.  I did not carry as big of a
"America loses its innocence" or "WASPs are evil" theme out of it as a
sound message that TV is entertainment and business--all that matters
is money and pleasing people.  The last few lines of the movie are
haunting and leave you thinking with a chilling sense of skepticism.
Overall, a spectacular film.  Richly presented with an outstanding cast
and an important message.

     "When a Man Loves a Woman" has serious flaws, but since it is 
topical, well-written, and has a popular, appealing lead actress, it 
will probably be successful.
     Meg Ryan plays an alcoholic mother who hits bottom, and enters a 
recovery program. Andy Garcia is the somewhat distant husband. When 
Ryan stops drinking, the reason why she was drinking becomes apparent, 
and Garcia finds he must change.
     The writing in the film is first-rate, and the direction is not 
bad either.
     It is interesting to note that Al Franken, the Saturday Night 
live creator of Stuart Smalley, the twelve-step program addict, was a 
co-writer. Clearly he has a lot of respect for the programs that he 
satirizes. They are seen as a god-send here.
     My main problem with this film is in the acting of Meg Ryan and 
Andy Garcia. Ryan does not give a convincing portrayal of an 
alcoholic. She seems fun and high on alcohol, and certainly 
overwhelmed by it, but she never shows any of the kind of emotional 
range needed to convey the experience of this woman.  She drinks a lot 
for some reason; Ryan is given lines to speak that are supposed to 
explain why to us; but nothing in her behavior connects us to her 
experience. She also never shows any of the physical changes 
alcoholics commonly experience -- weight gain, complexion changes, 
bloating, etc.
     Ryan's acting is deficient, but Garcia's seems almost totally 
absent.  He speaks every line in the same tone, as he has in other 
films.  He's about as well cast here as he possibly could be, since 
he's supposed to be emotionally distant and controlling.  But the 
movie would have been much better if an actor with more depth -- say, 
Nick Nolte -- had gotten the role.
     If you know someone who is an alcoholic or read the literature 
you will recognize many experiences in this film. The refusal to hear 
a call for help when asking for an explanation, the blaming of others 
for one's own deficiencies, the grown-up behavior from children, all 
are very well written and directed.  If only the actors had been up to 
conveying some of the experience rather than simply providing pretty 
faces for the advertising, this could have been a great film, rather 
than merely a mildly entertaining experience.
     One more odd thing: I was never able to understand why the theme 
from "Cats" plays such an important role here.  If you have an 
explanation, please let me know.

     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a good-hearted movie about alcoholism
and it really wants, I think, to help, to understand, to offer hope.
What it succeeds in doing, however, is to pretty up the problem to the
point where it's all just matter of mutual adjustment, really.  No big
deal.  This does alcoholism a disservice.  And the audience, too.
     Meg Ryan--who has the cutest gums in cinema--is Alice Green ("Hi,
Alice!") and she's been an alcoholic for a long time.  She has somehow
managed to keep her problem from her extraordinarily loving husband,
Michael (Andy Garcia--who has one of the most penetratingly loving
gazes in cinema), for so long that it's a little hard to believe that
Alice's squirreling away of litres of vodka in every nook and cranny of
their well-appointed home is going unnoticed (she admits she's up to a
quart a day).
     Well, the children (two adorable little girls) notice, actually,
and they end up finally making Mommy's difficulties clear to Daddy.
Mom is behaving oddly, like one day falling through the glass shower
door and lying there naked on the broken glass, looking dead.
     Alice and Michael are way too good to be true.  They smile way too
much.  The film feels liberal and enlightened because it proposes,
quite correctly, that Alice's alcoholism is not her fault.  What she
gets instead of blame is endless empathy from Michael--so much
self-sacrifice, so much spaniel-eyed support that you begin to long for
a scene or two where one of them acts real.  Alcoholism is whitewashed
into some marital glitch, most of the problem being, apparently, that
the doting Michael's paternalistic care for his wife makes her feel
small and inept.
     The script, by writer/executive producer Ronald Bass and
writer/executive producer Al Franken, manages to be witty and smarmy
all at the same time--no small feat, but one you might reasonably
expect from Bass, who pens weepers like RAIN MAN and THE JOY LUCK CLUB,
and from "Saturday Night Live" alumnus Al Franken, who obviously
possesses more than just a hint of his own creation, the new-age cable
TV host whose book I'M GOOD ENOUGH, I'M SMART ENOUGH, AND DOGGONE IT,
PEOPLE LIKE ME: DAILY AFFIRMATIONS WITH STUART SMALLEY is a
bestseller.  The film is adequately directed by Luis Mandoki, whose
Born Yesterday and White Palace have not kicked the envelope of
contemporary cinema.  It's also about 35 minutes too long.

     If you are an alcoholic, if any of your close friends or relatives
are, or if you or your close friends have a problem with anger and
depression, then WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN should be in your don't miss
category.  It is arguably, the most realistic film ever made about the
totality of an alcoholic's life from the highs to the lows and from
addiction to recovery and equally important about what it does to the
loved ones around them.  Watch the husband and especially the kids in
this movie.
     Meg Ryan gives an Academy Award caliber performance as the
alcoholic, and Andy Garcia does almost well as the confused and lost
husband.  Their two girls, played by Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman, are
good actresses that don't try to overact like many youngsters.  They
are totally believable and thereby make you feel very sad and frighten
for their characters.
     The directing by Luis Mandoki takes risks with the audience by
assuming they want honesty over entertainment.  This is a frightening
show and not a fun one.  The script by Ronald Bass and Al Franken goes
for the jugular in many of the scenes.  A very honest portrayal of
alcoholic and her loved ones.
     The movie starts with the signs of alcoholism starting to rear its
ugly head, but with many good times for Meg as she gets high and does
lots of wild and crazy things.  Soon, however, Meg is in the depths of
her addition and it rules her life.  She lives to drink.  Her husband
is oblivious to most of her problems as she can hid it so well.
Halfway through the movie she does get treatment and gives up drinking,
and then her life gets even worse for quite a while.  She was angry and
depressed while drinking, but even more so when she stops.  Except with
her recovered addicts, she is unbearable to be around.
     This is a unhappy tale which focuses as much if not more on the
husband of the alcoholic than on the alcoholic herself.  When she was
drinking, he had a role in her life as her (unsuccessful) savior.  Once
she gives up drinking, his purpose goes as well.
     This is only show I can remember where they smoked, and it made
sense for them to do so.  It seems that many alcoholics trade booze for
chain smoking as a lesser evil.
     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is an appropriately long show at 2:06,
but it needed the time to fully document the problems.  It is correctly
rated R for some scary and realistic material.  If your teenagers want
to see it, be sure and go with them and then discuss it afterwards.  I
award this excellent film *** 1/2.  Don't miss this show!

MPAA Rating  "R" (presumably for language and, I guess, adult themes) 
     What do you do if your wife is a drunk?  That is the question posed  
by WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, a middle-of-the-road movie-of-the-week  
that's neither gritty enough nor sappy enough to be completely  
interesting. 
     Michael (Andy Garcia) and Alice Green (Meg Ryan) are the model  
yuppie couple. He's an airplane pilot and she's a guidance counselor.  
Together they live in a comfortable San Franciso home and have two  
adorable pre-teen girls (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman) and one dedicated  
babysitter (Lauren Tom). But something's amiss in Wonderland as Alice is  
imbibing increasing amounts of alcohol.  Her hubby doesn't smell the  
signs until after an accident on a Mexican vacation. She vows change, he  
accepts change and, of course, the problem stays a problem.. 
     On the Squish Scale, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is surprisingly  
tolerable. The standard teary tricks-- such as the obligatory musical  
montage-- are all very tasteful and the director doesn't try to pull too  
many strings at once.  That is, with two exceptions. 
     The more sensitive viewers will gasp when Alice drunkenly strikes at  
her child. (Listen to the audience!) And all able-bodied attendees should  
probably leave five minutes before the film finishes to avoid any  
accidents on tear-soaked surfaces. :) 
     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN doesn't have much of an edge, either, and  
never elaborates on the hows and whys of drug addiction.  But who cares?   
The leads are attractive and, despite a pace that leaves way too much  
room for second-guessing, deliver a reasonably believable story. 
     You can't beat Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia for star power. The  
criminally cute Ryan has a good roller-coaster role, even if her  
character isn't completely lived-in.  Garcia has the harder part to play.  
His character is *so* adorably concerned and *so* far off-base from  
knowing how to help his wife.  He's a marvel of male misunderstanding and  
helps drive home the message that recovery requires work on *both* sides  
of the equation. 
     Technical credits are all very good, with the exception of whoever  
came up with that terrible title. There is a reason that certain states  
have laws prohibiting the naming of a film after any song covered by  
Michael Bolton. :)

Starring:  Andy Garcia, Meg Ryan, Lauren Tom, Tina Majorino. 
Screenplay:  Ronald Bass and Al Franken.
Director:  Luis Mandoki.
     This is the contradiction of WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN:  as
impressed as I was with most of its parts, I kept coming up with 
better ways to piece them together.  It's that rare film that pulls 
very few punches in its examination of a family in crisis, but there 
is a schizophrenia in the perspective.  There are some extremely 
effective performances, but director Luis Mandoki shows us far too 
much from the perspective of the alcoholic character.  Ultimately 
there is more right than there is wrong with WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, 
yet is also makes choices which are more safe than they are 
appropriate.
     Michael (Andy Garcia) and Alice (Meg Ryan) are a San Francisco
couple who, in the parlance, "seem to have it all."  Michael is an 
airline pilor, and Alice a school counselor; they have a lovely home, 
two daughters (Tina Majorino, Mae Whitman) and an au pair (Lauren 
Tom).  They also have a problem:  Alice is an alcoholic. The problem 
seems "under control" until two close calls froce the Greens to 
confront the situation.  As Alice goes into rehab, Michael is left to 
hold the family together.  But that might be even harder than it first 
appears, as the lack of social lubricant exposes cracks in Michael and 
Alice's relationship, and the time comes for hard decisions.
     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is grounded in two expertly developed
characters, well-acted by Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan.  Michael is the 
consummate co-dependant, blinding himself to Alice's alcoholism 
because it's easier and more satisfying for him to play the problem- 
solver.  He doesn't respect Alice, and a couple of great scenes 
demonstrate how he treats her like one of his children.  Most 
effective are scenes where Michael realizes that the girls, who are 
always around when he is off on a trip, are much more aware of what is 
going on than he is.  Ryan is solid as the fragile and frightened 
Alice, and plays a very restrained drunk.  She also makes a believable 
transition after her detox, leading into a fine bit of acting in a 
counseling session.  The big showdown between Michael and Alice is 
completely raw and very compelling, and Garcia and Ryan have 
tremendous chemistry.
     The problem is that WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN doesn't commit to
its point of view.  I felt this was essentially the story of the 
family's response to and discovery of the extent of Alice's problem, 
and not the story of Alice and her recovery.  Consequently, I wasn't 
bothered by the slickness of the production, because it fit with 
Michael's lack of awareness of what was going on beneath the surface.  
But then Mandoki and screenwriters Ronald Bass and Al Franken seem to 
want it both ways, showing us Alice sneaking into the street for a 
drink, or in the middle of a case of the DT's.  When the nuts and 
bolts of Alice's addiction were given the spotlight, the polish seemed 
inappropriate.  I wanted all of our discoveries about Alice to come as 
Michael discovered them (like well-handled scenes of Alice comforting 
a friend from rehab out of our hearing), so that I didn't feel Ryan 
was just being given showy scenes because she's a star.  A focus on 
Michael would have mad this a very different film from most films 
about substance abuse, but WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN retreats into the 
obvious.
     One key element of WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN which bears
specific mention is the dynamic performance of Tina Majorino as eldest 
daughter Jess.  The child of Alice's first marriage, Jess brings a 
host of abandonment issues to the table, and a worldliness beyond her 
years which still seems very real.  Majorino's eyes are filled with 
profound sadness, and her reactions to Alice's final washout are 
stunning.  It was moments like her last scene with Garcia which 
finally brought me to tears, and convinced me that there should have 
been more family moments.  The original title of WHEN A MAN LOVES A 
WOMAN was SIGNIFICANT OTHER, but it really should have been 
SIGNIFICANT OTHERS.  When it lost sight of the others affected by 
alcoholism, it missed the chance to be truly special.

     The previews for WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN do this film an 
injustice.  Heavy on poorly-edited melodramatic sequences, they give 
little inkling of the level of emotional honesty attained.  Luis 
Mandoki's film succeeds not because it tackles alcoholism, but because 
it faces up to the trauma that eats away at the lives of the non-
alcoholics in the family. 
     One failing of the script is that it assumes an unlikely level of 
ignorance from its audience.  Alcoholism is such a pervasive social 
problem that it's hard to accept that anyone likely to see WHEN A MAN 
LOVES A WOMAN wouldn't have a better understanding of the disease than 
the movie gives them credit for.  After all, everything from high school 
health classes to Oprah have, at one point or another, addressed the 
issue.  Unlike AIDS, alcoholism is not a new disease that the public 
needs to be educated about.   
     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN centers on a seemingly-happily married 
couple.  Michael Green (Andy Garcia) and his wife Alice (Meg Ryan) have, 
at first glance, the perfect relationship.  But take a peek beneath the 
veneer, and there are problems.  Alice is a habitual drinker, and her 
periods of sobriety are getting fewer and fewer.  Meanwhile, Michael's 
duties as an airline pilot take him away from home for weeks at a time, 
keeping him ignorant of the extent of his wife's problem.   
     Completing the family unit are Jess (Tina Marjorino), Alice's 
daughter by another man whom Michael has adopted as his own, and Casey 
(Mae Whitman), the four-year old child of the Greens.  The presence of 
these children, and their importance to the development of the story, is 
what elevates WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.  As potent as some of the scenes 
between Michael and Alice are, those featuring Jess or Casey invariably 
have greater impact.  It helps that both young actresses are believable. 
     Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia were probably given the lead roles more 
because of box office appeal than an ability to bring superior depth to 
their characters.  Surprisingly, while neither turns in an exceptional 
performance, they are both solid, and each has a few scenes in which 
they shine. 
     The ending is too facile, and WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN may take 
longer than necessary to arrive at its resolution.  There are moments 
throughout when the script is apt to strike a raw nerve with some, as is 
often the case when a "real" issue is probed with any degree of 
sincerity.  Whatever else it may do, this film does not play it safe, 
and the risks it takes keep the audience engaged by the drama. 
     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is about pain.  This is not an original 
topic for a movie - especially one about alcoholism - but the script 
does a good enough job establishing the dynamics of the Green family 
that we never doubt that the story deserves to be told.  The film's 
poignancy is its strength, even as occasional didactic tendencies are 
its weakness.  In balance, the former by far outweighs the latter, 
making this a worthwhile picture.
