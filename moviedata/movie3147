Reviewed August 21, 1999.
"Mickey Blue Eyes," directed by Kelly Makin, comes only five months after the 
other, fairly similar mob comedy, "Analyze This," which starred Robert De 
Niro and Billy Crystal, but the basic premise rarely feels cliched or 
overused, due to the snappy, often rib-ticklingly funny screenplay, by Adam 
Scheinman and Robert Kuhn. If the romance at the forefront isn't particularly 
engaging (and for Grant, his other romantic comedy of the year, "Notting 
Hill," is stronger in this aspect) and the climax is predictable, what makes 
"Mickey Blues Eyes" entertaining and recommendable are the consistently big 
laughs that are generated in scene after scene, some of which had me smiling 
and giggling for several minutes after the comedic payoff.
Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) is an English art dealer and auctioneer in 
Manhattan with a profession he enjoys and a girlfriend, Gina (Jeanne 
Tripplehorn), whom he loves. After Gina tearfully rejects his marriage 
proposal for unknown reasons, Michael makes his way down to her father's 
Italian restaurant to talk with him. Never meeting her father, Frank Vitale 
(James Caan), before, he quickly gets the hint that the reason Gina had been 
hiding him the whole time is because she was afraid to tell Michael that her 
family is involved in the big-time mob business. Frank instantly accepts 
Michael into the family, and after a heart-to-heart talk with Gina in which 
he lets her know that he cares and loves for her regardless, they become 
engaged. Complications ensue when Michael unwittingly becomes involved in the 
illegal family business, and soon finds himself guilty of extortion, money 
laundering, murder, and having to lie to Gina in fear that he may lose her. 
Worse yet, Michael is mistaken as Mickey Blue Eyes, another powerful mob 
boss, a particular problem since he has an English accent, and is just about 
as far away from being Italian as he could possibly be.
Since the romance between Michael and Gina is underwritten and never truly 
convincing, there are two major things going for "Mickey Blue Eyes," which 
are its attributes to being successful: Hugh Grant and the great big laughs. 
A person could argue that Grant almost always plays the same role in film 
after film, but I beg to differ. Although both English gentlemen, Grant's 
character in "Notting Hill" was more reserved and shy than his character 
here, even if both are likable and yearning for love, while in the past, he 
has played a wide range of roles, including a slimy stage director in 1995's 
"An Awfully Big Adventure." What Grant possesses is that vital "everyman" 
quality that you rarely find in Hollywood, and because of his average looks 
and good-willed personality, is instantly more accessible to an audience in 
order for them to root for him. Also, in "Mickey Blue Eyes," Grant puts his 
comic skills at work like never before and garners several sizable laughs, 
especially in a scene in which he is trying to use a mobster accent in a 
restaurant, and fails miserably at it.
On a comedic level, "Mickey Blue Eyes" ranks up there with "American Pie" and 
"Drop Dead Gorgeous" as being one of the funniest films of the year. Classic 
sequences and lines of dialgoue abound, including one scene set at a Chinese 
restaurant in which the owner of the place, shall we say, gets a bit forceful 
towards Gina to eat her fortune cookie, and ends up spitting out expletives 
at her. An on-going joke involving a talking, stuffed monkey also is comic 
gold, as is the charades involving a hearing-impaired old lady who 
desperately wants to buy a piece of artwork at the latest auction, as well as 
the clueless involvement of a kindly neighbor of Michael's who more or less 
witnesses a murder and thinks nothing about it.
Through complicated circumstances, "Mickey Blue Eyes" concludes at the 
wedding of Michael and Gina, in which a supposed-to-be-fake murder is to take 
place, and there are a few twists and turns that occur in the last ten 
minutes. The final curve in the plot is easily predicted from the second a 
key moment arises, and the happy ending is just a little too abrupt for my 
taste, but how could you not give a film at least a marginally positive 
review when it offers so many bright moments? The writing is congruously 
witty and smart, and the successful humor really is worth the price of 
admission. "Mickey Blue Eyes" is the film "Analyze This" only wishes it was, 
both in the enjoyment and comedic departments.

Starring:        Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan
Mickey Blue Eyes is a very funny movie, and what makes it so funny is
that very few of the laugh lines have been shown in the previews and
promotional clips.  That's especially amazing because Hugh Grant has been
seen `everywhere' extolling the virtues of this latest picture,
co-produced by his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley.  Too many movies lately
have been ruined by the overexposure of the `funny' scenes.  They are like
connect-the-dot puzzles that tell you all.  You simply have to put them in
the proper order.
With Mickey Blue Eyes you are aware of the basic storyline.  Hugh Grant
plays a square type of individual.   He is an auctioneer who has fallen in
love with Gina, an elementary school teacher (Tripplehorn).  He proposes
marriage, in a hilarious scene that's stolen by the Chinese
waitress.whoops, that's ownerwho involves herself in the proposal.  
It's vignettes like this that make you think about small `supporting
actress' possibilities.  
He discovers that his possible future father-in-law, Frank (Caan) is a
member of the mob, who `launders' money for them.  It is the merging of
the two lifestyles that gives us the wonderful basis of the film.  This is
not award winning movie making by any means but it is a very enjoyable
film, well worth the price of admission.  Although it is rated PG-13, I
really don't think that it's aimed at children.  There's nothing so bad
that they shouldn't see it, but it's not an example of what they should
emulate.  Rather than taking the kids to it, go by yourself and sit back
and laugh.  I really want to see this again, but it's probably one of
those flicks that I'll catch on free TV and watch more than once.  For
what it is, I give it an A-, an excellent light, romantic comedy.

Piggy Piggy Die Die"
Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Burt Young. Rated
PG-13.
Hollywood actors with strong British accents and no desire to master an
American one will have trouble getting roles that don't involve playing
an Englishman in America. This has led to the constant typecasting of
talents like Hugh Grant who always ends up playing the bumbling Brit in
romantic comedies when he is likely capable of so much more. Thus his
performances have become excruciatingly predictable. As many have
pointed out, Hugh Grant is a great personality and an even better screen
presence. A shame his personality and presence are precisely the same in
nearly every film he does.
Mickey Blue Eyes is a romantic comedy but it is also a spoof of
organized crime. It is not the outright parody that Mafia! was and it
takes its story very seriously but the script certainly has a satirical
edge. Grant plays Michael Felgate, a New York auctioneer who is madly in
love with Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn). He finds an elaborate way of
proposing marriage to her. It backfires, but when he does get around to
asking her to marry him she breaks into tears and runs away.
Why? Mike finds out that she is part of a mafioso family. Most of her
relatives have spent time in jail at some point in their lives and are
still very much mobsters. Gina insists that shoe can't marry him because
it will get him involved in her family's dealings. They do you one
favor, she says, and you're indebted to them forever.
Eventually Gina gives in and the couple weds, but only after Michael
solemnly swears that he will not get involved with her family. He does,
of course. The mob scratches his back and he is forced to scratch back.
They (Gina's father, played by James Caan, her uncle the mob boss
portrayed by Burt Young and others played by Joe Viterelli and John
Ventimiglia) get Michael involved in a money laundering scheme by making
Michael auction off various paintings of theirs, making people that owe
them money buy those paintings and making Michael hand over the money.
This gets Michael in some trouble with the FBI who are wise to the
mobsters' schemes.
Scripted by Adam Scheinman (Little Big League) and Robert Kuhn (The
Cure, an underrated 1995 gem) and directed by Kids in the Hall veteran
Kelly Makin, Mickey Blue Eyes is a tremendously funny movie. The jabs at
the mafia are not as in-your-face as they were in Mafia! but they are
twice as witty and twice as entertaining. A few, indeed, garnered none
other than belly laughs from me, which took me by surprise because what
I had expected least from this movie is the do-anything-for-a-laugh
attitude it employed.
The highlight of this energetic romp has to be the brilliant, knee-
slapping turn by the often humorless James Caan (Eraser). Everything he
tries with his deadpan performance works and the result is comedy bliss.
Hugh Grant is equally effective; he manages to be funny even though he
is playing the same role he's played in countless movies. The only weak
link in the cast is Jeanne Tripplehorn who manages to make her character
bitchy for 99% of her screen time. Why would Hugh Grant want to marry
her again?
It's a shame that the romance disappears for most of the middle portion
of the film to make room for Michael's mafia antics. Funny as those may
be, if this is the romantic comedy that Warner is oh-so-feverishly
trying to promote, why not make the romance a central part of the
picture? That worked so well in Notting Hill.
The ending of the movie is far too convenient and too cloying, but
everything leadiing up to it is a comic delight. Affectionate, hilarious
and light as a feather, Mickey Blue Eyes may not be the movie of the
year but it's an entertaining -- if instantly forgettable -- diversion.

   Just when you thought that romantic comedies had to be
sappy and unbelievable like "Notting Hill" or silly and just
plain unfunny like "Runaway Bride," along comes a film that
restores your faith in the genre.  With a script loaded with
sharp lines delivered with punch and direction that paces the
material superbly, "Mickey Blue Eyes" proves that even
Hollywood's love for scripts about the mob need not be
circular-filed as antiquated.  Credit  "The Godfather" series for
allowing a number of riffs about organized crime and a
plethora of films winking at the otherwise deadly serious
game of mob rule.  "Mickey Blue Eyes" may just be the
perfectly ripe pick of the harvest given the strong
performances of Hugh Grant in his best role to date and the
great James Caan in yet another confirmation of his
distinguished thespian craftsmanship.
   The comic whirls flow from a proposed marriage between
two people who are about as different in their cultural
backgrounds as Papuans from Episcopalians--in the efforts of
one of the pair to fashion himself into the society of the other. 
Hugh Grant performs once again in the role of a proper
Englishman of high breeding.  In this case he is the
auctioneer of a posh, Sotheby-style house which sells
paintings that are not quite in the class as the million-dollar
works hawked in the Duval's House of Francois Girard's
movie "The Red Violin," but which are peddled to the
connoisseurs and investors alike in a Fifth Avenue property in
Manhattan.  Screenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert
Kuhn start the gags rolling from the very beginning as the
dignified Mr. Felgate pronounces an oil painting of a buxom
reclining person "Woman with Massive Bottom." When a
client bids $23,000, he determines that this comes to
"$11,500 per buttock" to the amusement of the crowd. 
Perhaps the sight-gag highlight of the film comes in a
Chinese restaurant as Michael proposes to his girl friend,
Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) after arranging with the
owner to stuff a fortune of his choosing into her cookie.  
  Gina rebuffs the poor guy because she is actually a mob
princess, daughter of crime lord Frank Vitale (James Caan)
and niece to godfather Vito Graziosi (Burt Young) and does
not want Michael to become involved with the wiseguys. The
proper young Englishman is then even more determined to fit
in with the gangsters, to become like them while somehow
keeping his hands clean.  
   One of gags is positively surreal, even perhaps a riff on
some of the junk that art collectors buy purely in the hope of
selling at a profit years later.  The jest involves a painting
done by the son of a mobster featuring an airbound Jesus
mowing down an enemy with an Uzi, a monstrosity that
somehow is sold for $130,000.  What gives Hugh Grant the
latitude to turn in a smashing performances involves the
many ways he tries to prove to the shady characters that
make up his beloved's greater family that he's one of them--
even to the extent to muffling his king's English to say
"fuhgeddaboudit" to pass himself off as Little Big Mickey
Blue Eyes form Kansas City.  In one scene he executes a
striptease to distract Gina from evidence linking him with the
mob.  To gain credibility with the mob he is obliged, in
another scene, to rough up his auction-house boss, the even
more proper Brit played by the inimitable James Fox.
   The action comes to an anarchic conclusion filmed at that
celebrated wedding factory, Leonard's of Great Neck, in
which the FBI unfolds an intricate plot to arrest the crime
boss, Uncle Vito--who is determined to have Michael killed at
his own nuptials. 
   "Mickey Blue-Eyes" features a sound track of bouncy
Italian music, particularly Bob Merrill's rousing "Mambo
Italiano" and is brightly filmed to best show off New York's
color and ambience.  The only way this splashy show could
have been made even more spectacular would have been to
cast Annabella Sciorra as the bride-to-be instead of the
insipid Jeanne Tripplehorn.

IN SHORT: Like striking the comedy motherlode. Delightful.
Mickey Blue Eyes hasa gotsa everyting yousa wantsinna Mafia movie...
Waitasec. Backup to the English thing. My femme friends tell me that
should read "A well dressed cuddly bunny cute Englishman . . ." 'cuz
lightning has struck for the second time this summer; Hugh Grant stars
in a great date movie. Here's the secret to Grant -- he's a
non-threatening cuddly bunny, a perfect everyman in a strange land;
whether it's in the Hollywood star system or the generic Mafia
stereotype it makes no difference. He makes men and women laugh. He
makes us all happy when he lands the woman he wants. Warm fuzzies all
around in most of his flicks; simply great date material.
This time out, Grant is Michael Felgate, an auctioneer at the New York
based Cromwell's Auction House. He is madly in love with a school
teacher Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and, after three months, is ready to
propose marriage. This comes early in the movie -- she's going to say
"no", but that's just a comic coda to a scene side splitting enough
that, in any other "ordinary" dateflick, it would be enough to make you
happy you spent the cash on tickets. Luckily, there's a lot more, and a
lot more funny stuff, coming.
Trying to figure out this unpleasant turn of events, Michael tracks down
Gina's father Frank Vitale (James Caan), owner of an Italian restaurant
called "The La Trattoria". The sight of actor Joseph Vitterelli, you'll
know him when you see him, sitting at the bar clues us in to the fact
that Michael has never seen a Godfather-style movie in his life. He is
not ignorant of The Mob, and his protestations that they will never
affect his love or his life to be with Gina are, of course, the
cinematic equivalent of spitting in the wind. Which leaves a standard
stranger in a strange land premise, always good for a story and, in this
case, perfect for a Hugh Grant romantic comedy.
The plot points include money laundering, murder, an FBI sting and the
inevitable bloodbath. Each sets up a series of gags that are
increasingly funny. I don't have to tell you about Grant trying to fake
the accent when he's passed off as a mobster from Kansas City -- it's in
the teevee commercial. The strength of this flick is that, even when you
know the joke from the advertising, there's still plenty left in the
flick that tops what you know. Like I wrote, a motherlode.
Unlike the earlier Mob spoof Analyze This, Mickey Blue Eyes is virtually
profanity free. Yes, the Italian Mob stereotype gets shredded for comedy
punchlines, making Cranky wonder where the Italian-American
Anti-Defamation League is, but Grant allows Adam Scheinmand and Robert
Kuhn's screenplay to lob a couple of grenades towards the English as
well. You'll know it when you see it.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mickey Blue Eyes, he would have
paid...
Damn fine fun.

There are good mob dramas and bad mob dramas, just as there are good mob
comedies and bad mob comedies. ANALYZE THIS (8/10) with DeNiro and Crystal
sure proved to be a great mob comedy earlier this year, so could Caan and
Grant strike gold for the second time with Hugh's sexy girlfriend, Elizabeth
Hurley, producing this Englishman-getting-caught-up-in-the-mob romantic
comedy? Howsabout readin' on to finda out...
PLOT:
An English auctioneer proposes to his Italian-American girlfriend, only to
find out that her family is heavily involved in the mafia. Despite her
reservations, he convinces her that he will not allow himself to get
involved with their illegal activities, but slowly finds himself drowning
into their seedy underworld.
CRITIQUE:
Likeable comedy felt like a pretty good video rental idea, but lacks the
added oomph to highly recommend on the big screen. This film has the right
look, great music, and all the usual suspects from all the other mob movies,
but didn't consistently offer a rat-tat-tat of laughs or a genuinely
believable romance. There were however several scattered funny moments, a
superb performance from Burt Young as the mob boss (This dude gave me the
chills just lookin' at him!), and an enjoyable score which kept all of the
proceedings on an upbeat level all the whole way through. Caan was
surprisingly underused in my opinion, while Grant tacked in another decent
job as the comic lead, with plenty of endearingly goofy moments, alongside
his ever-present puppy-dog look, which apparently, most folks seem to like?
The story itself was 'sarright, but I didn't personally buy into all of the
goings-on during the film's finale, with certain people suddenly shifting
loyalties like nobody's business. I mean, it was like...foggetaboutitt!
Small plot holes aside, most of the film was enjoyable enough to watch, due
to the interesting premise, but a classic romantic comedy, or mob comedy for
that matter, it is not. Don't expect to find the same level of humor as in
ANALYZE THIS (8/10) because that film's comedy was an uzi compared to this
movie's shotgun. But if you really like any of the principals in this one,
love catchy Italian music, don't mind a reasonably light romance, and don't
have a problem with Hugh Grant's moping, then by all means, see this movie.
Either way, my recommendation of this film ranks higher on a video level,
than an actual pay-full-price cinematic release. Badda-bing...badda-boom!!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Despite the fact that James Caan has been known to play many Italian roles,
and the fact that he was twice voted "Italian of the Year" by unspecified
Italian-American organizations, he actually comes from a Jewish-Irish
heritage. He was born in Queens, New York, where he used to be known simply
as "Shoulders". Caan has five children from four marriages, and once lived
in the Playboy Mansion for a long period of time during the 1980s, after his
sister passed away from cancer. He claimed to have lost all passion for
acting at that time, and dove right into the cocaine and alcohol. He's
feeling much better now.
Before production began on this film, Grant's English auctioneer character
had been a neurotic Jewish lawyer. Two script doctors later...voila!
Hugh Grant actually filmed some additional scenes for this movie (With
DGA-sanctioned director Carl Gottlieb supervising), when director Makin's
wife was having a baby, and he could not return for re-shoots. Gottlieb
wrote the script for the original JAWS movie directed by Steven Spielberg.
Seeing that director Makin also directed THE KIDS IN THE HALL motion
picture, along with a few of the actual "Kids" TV episodes, it shouldn't
surprise anyone to find "kid in the hall" Scott Thompson with a role as an
FBI agent in this movie.
Jeanne Tripplehorn once had a long-term relationship with actor/director Ben
Stiller.

 Somehow, I feel like I've traveled back in time.  I feel like I have
journeyed to a land not far away (my local multiplex) and a not-so-long time
ago (February) when I was watching Analyze This.  By the time Analyze This
came out, it was mob spoof number three ("The Don's Analyst" on behalf of
TMC, "The Sopranos" on behalf of HBO).  Mickey Blue Eyes becomes number four
this summer as Hugh Grant once attempts to be a perfect British gentleman in
awkward circumstances.
 We have the same backdrop that Analyze This did, of people getting whacked
and an outsider being let into the group.  We have the same silly jokes, the
same good moments, and the same generally bearable nature.  "The Sopranos"
and Analyze This both stand out on the list of good mob spoofs, but Mickey
Blue Eyes seems just to take on this newest formula: the mob spoof.
 Sure, they left out the shrink this time but they put Hugh Grant in
instead.  This time, Grant wants to marry Jeanne Tripplehorn (after 3 months
of dating) but she doesn't want him to become a wiseguy.  Between Analyze
This and Mickey Blue Eyes, I sense a pattern with botched mob weddings, but
who cares.
 Mickey Blue Eyes does a fair job of holding its own as a movie, adding in
some original scenes such as Grant tripping over his British accent as he
attempts to say fuggetaboutit, a phrase which I was able to pull off living
in New Jersey after only a week without a drop of Italian blood in me.
Another great point comes as two pairs of mobsters try to bury bodies on
opposite sides of a small pile of dirt.
 However, memorable scenes is all that Mickey Blue Eyes amounts to.  It
tries to have a part of it concerned with serious plot, and, unlike Analyze
This, fails completely.  Not that it matters at all, because this is still
summer and still no one really gives a damn.
 Hugh Grant does his best with the part but it is highly obvious how awkward
he feels, perhaps because his criminal behavior is usually limited to the
misdemeanor "Soliciting the services of a prostitute".  Jeanne Tripplehorn
seems to always be the person pitted against the mob (i.e. The Firm).  James
Caan does all right, but simply doesn't have the comic gumption to pull his
performance off.
 The question that both Mickey Blue Eyes and The Thirteenth Floor brought to
mind is very simple: is the bizarre becoming the norm?  Both of them copied
films that went away from the norm, and, as a consequence, ended up as a
weak facsimile of the original.  The spirit seems to have died somewhere in
between.
 This serves to prove my theory about Hollywood: that they can only copy.
Hollywood has spent years seeing a film, saying "wow, that's innovative",
and making copies of it until it becomes a formula.  There are originals
somewhere, but they are buried so deep in cliche that, by the time we get to
The Thirteenth Floor and Mickey Blue Eyes, we are so sick and tired of it
that we don't care where it came from and swear off the formula as a whole.
 Another prime example comes in the new horror films, which remain conscious
of their level of self-insult, but, even in the case of The Blair Witch
Project, only serve to follow formulas.
 In my review of Message in a Bottle, I pleaded for intelligent characters.
In this review, I'm making an honest plea for a new plot.  I'm so tired of
your formulaic crap, and I'm sure I'm not alone in my gripe and groan.

     Hugh Grant hit paydirt once this summer, in NOTTING HILL.  Can he
do it again if you take away Julia Roberts?  And throw in an unlikely
comedy about murderous gangsters, an auction house, and a botched
wedding?  
     Yes he can!  MICKEY BLUE EYES, against all odds, is nothing short
of fall-down funny  on par with NOTTING HILL, SOUTH PARK, and AUSTIN
POWERS 2 as one of the best comedies of the summer.
     The plot involves Grant's milquetoast auctioneer, who, after three
months of dating, proposes to his girlfriend (Tripplehorn), whom he
doesn't realize is the daughter of a major New York Mafioso (Caan).
Hilarity ensues when the mob family tries to rein Grant in for various
money laundering schemes, dubbing him `Mickey Blue Eyes.'  Enter the
FBI, and accidental shooting, nocturnal shallow-grave burials, and a
payback/revenge scheme, and you've got some pretty weighty elements here
 but BLUE EYES usually makes the most of them all  in a comic sense,
of course.
     Don't be fooled: Grant carries this picture all by his lonesome.
Tripplehorn is fine, but uninspiring.  The mob guys are broadly drawn
stereotypes.  Caan is playing his usual tough guy and doesn't have a
whole lot of screen time.  With the exception of a few bizarre
supporting characters (see also NOTTING HILL, again), Hugh Grant owns
this show.
     And therein we see what a comic talent he really is.  Essentially,
MICKEY BLUE EYES is a fish out of water tale, only the water finds the
fish this time around.  And watching this fish squirm is one hell of a
good time.

     Michael Felgate (played by Hugh Grant) is Manhattan art auctioneer
with a mild, non-assertive personality.  He lets the truckers he deals
with walk all over him.  He wants to marry Gina (Jean Tripplehorn) and
she seems to love him, but she is strangely reticent to marry for
reasons she will not say.  When Michael goes to her father's bar and
restaurant he finds out part of the reason why. Her father (James Caan)
and her uncles make up a dangerous crime family.  Gina is sure that if
Michael marries into the family he will be pulled into the criminal
activity.  Mike is just as certain that there is no reason that he
would do that.  But almost immediately he is asked as a favor to use
his auction house to auction off a garish painting created by one of
the crime family members.  This starts an escalating chain of reluctant
favors and counter-favors and a chain of events that pull Mike into the
whirlpool associating him closer and closer to organized crime.
     The problem with this film is that it seems to have been written
by formula.  It started with a skeleton of a cliched plot and then
apparently the writers started hanging jokes on it like ornaments on a
Christmas tree.  The jokes all have little to do with each other.  The
most that they have in common is that they use of screen time.  One can
almost see the writers sitting there saying, "Okay, now we have a 45-
minute story.  Let's throw in a comic FBI agent.  Now we are up to 50
minutes...."  Even then the central plot builds to a very predictable
ending.  Anyone surprised by the surprise ending is probably new to
1990s cinema.
     Hugh Grant was charming early in his career with his boyish smile
and youthful charm.  But he seems incapable of stretching himself as an
actor or leaving his comfort zone.  In this film we care for his
character about to the extent that we want to cuddle and protect a
small child.  Listening to him try to talk like a gangster is like
watching a child trying to sound like an adult in a school play.  It is
cute but it is not really entertaining and shows very little
accomplishment.  Here we are not pulled into the plot or the irony of
the situation and the jokes are not particularly perceptive.  And worst
of all they are rarely funny.  The views we have of crime figures are
largely cliched.  That is part of the joke, that they are instantly
recognizable as crime figures. That worked in THE FRESHMAN, but that
film had a much better story behind it. James Caan provides the only
interesting role interpretation and even he can not make things click.

Let's face it.  Kelly Makin's MICKEY BLUE EYES is ANALYZE THIS-lite, but
that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Any movie with Hugh Grant (NOTTING
HILL), James Caan (THE GODFATHER) and Jeanne Tripplehorn (BASIC INSTINCT) is
almost guaranteed to be an entertaining success, even if a similar one with
Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow was better.  Big laughs are
big laughs.  That another movie earlier in the year would rate higher on the
laugh-o-meter is irrelevant.  MICKEY BLUE EYES delivers more than enough
crowd pleasing humor.
Hugh Grant, with his boyish grin and his rumpled good looks, is the master
of the I-can't-believe-this-is-happening-to-me situation.  He wears his
charming naiveté on his sleeve and makes what he does look so easy that it
doesn't appear to be acting.  After all, he always seems to be playing
himself.
In NOTTING HILL, he was astonished to find that a movie star had come into
his bookstore and his life.  In MICKEY BLUE EYES, he's shocked to find that
he has accidentally joined the Mafia.  And this isn't even the worst part.
He incurs the wrath of a rival family, who wants revenge.
It all starts innocently enough.  Art auction house manager Michael Felgate
(Grant) tries the most charming of devices to propose to his girlfriend,
Gina (Tripplehorn).  At a Chinese restaurant, he attempts to arrange for the
owner to stuff his marriage proposal into Gina's fortune cookie.  The
results prove surprisingly disastrous, as do most of poor Michael's actions
in the story.  The upshot is that Gina refuses to marry him because she's
worried that her father, Frank (Caan), will corrupt Michael.  Frank, an
extremely friendly Mafioso runs a restaurant known as "The La Trattoria."
Michael points out the problem with the name, but, as in the rest of the
story, people don't pay much attention to his opinion.
A sophisticated English gentleman, Michael appears noticeably awkward among
Frank and his male-kissing Italian "family." The movie, with few exceptions,
never forgets it's a parody.  The well chosen and high-spirited music, as in
the "We Are Family" song played when Michael first meets Frank's coworkers,
adds to the movie's merriment.
After Gina agrees to marry Michael, her worst fears are realized.  Before he
knows it, Michael's gallery is laundering money for the mob, and the FBI is
investigating.  Although trying hard to avoid any degree of criminality,
Michael, nevertheless, manages to earn himself the moniker of Kansas City
Mickey Blue Eyes.  The movie's funniest scenes have him trying with little
success to mimic the gang's pronunciation of such classic lines as
"Fuggedaboutit."
."
With his grace and style, Grant dominates the film, but the rest of the cast
nicely complement him.  Tripplehorn, whose strength is her sexuality, taps a
comedic reservoir rarely seen before other than her work in last year's
underappreciated black comedy VERY BAD THINGS.  Caan is delightfully
charming as the father with a disreputable profession.  Frank's a swell guy
even if his car does tend to be stuffed with boxes of stolen Cuisinarts and
his trunk has the occasional dead body.  Every actor who has ever played an
Italian mobster appears to be in the large and effective supporting cast.
Director Makin (KIDS IN THE HALL) generally has a good sense of comedic
timing, although some parts  of the movie flag briefly.  The movie is
old-fashioned fun.  But does it go so far as to be memorable?
Fuggedaboutit.
MICKEY BLUE EYES runs 1:42.  It is rated PG-13 for brief strong language,
some violence and sensuality and would be fine for kids 9 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, found the film funny and gave it ***.  He liked the
actors and the ending surprises.

        If you've been following automotive trends as of late you'll know
that, probably around the year 2009, every single car on the road will look
like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  A similar feeling washed over me while
watching "Mickey Blues Eyes" the other night.  "Er, didn't I just *see*
this movie?"  Of course, I did.
        "Mickey Blue Eyes" is a mob-related comedy that stars Hugh Grant.
It shouldn't be confused with "Analyze This," a mob-related comedy without
Hugh Grant, or "Notting Hill," a Hugh Grant comedy that has nothing
whatsoever to do with organized crime.  But after about thirteen
middle-of-the-road comedies in a row, the lines begin to blur some.
        This one (I think) stars Grant as a Manhattan-based auctioneer with
"floppy hair" and all those other endearing Hugh Grant mannerisms.  He's
about to pop the question to the love of his life, high-school teacher
Jeanne Tripplehorn.  Jeanne has been cozy ("The Firm") and sexy
("Waterworld") before but here's she's just plain old Jeanne, neither cozy
nor sexy and just a wee bit boring.  Think what they could have done with
Julia Roberts or, come to think of it, Robert De Niro in the Jeanne
Tripplehorn role.
        Jeanne is nervous about getting engaged to Hugh because her father
(a surprisingly under-the-top James Caan) is, well, "connected."  "Once
you're family, you're Family" she cautions Hugh, but the twitchy Brit
remains committed to her.  Before Jeanne can say "I told you so," Hugh's
making notes to rent "GoodFellas" and "The Godfather" trilogy, and learning
how to say "forgedabouddit."
        Grant is cute, as is "Mickey Blue Eyes" (co-produced by Elizabeth
Hurley no less), but I liked the Jeep a whole lot more before they made it
look like every other stinkin' SUV on the planet.

With the huge early summer hit Notting Hill under their belts, both Hugh
Grant and Julia Roberts are trying to duplicate that success with
another round of romance this season. Roberts teamed up again with
Richard Gere for the altar comedy Runaway Bride, and now Grant is trying
his hand at the Mafia spoof Mickey Blue Eyes. Despite coming so soon
after Analyze This, the Englishman uses his naive charm and manages to
fuel this predictable but cute comedy simply by using his puppy dog
eyes.
You know the look. Grant has used it to his advantage ever since Four
Weddings and a Funeral. It's this `I'm in over my head / I can't believe
I'm doing this' expression that coats Mickey Blue Eyes with an
appealing, totally charming glaze. I don't know, someday maybe it will
get old. But for now, his innocent looks and actions perfectly suit
comedy vehicles such as this.
Grant plays Michael Felgate, an art auctioneer who's about to get in
over his head. Michael is hopelessly in love with a pretty
school-teacher named Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and after some
complications involving a botched fortune cookie message, he asks for
her hand in marriage. Gina backs out immediately to Michael's confusion,
and afterward when he confronts her, she explains: `I can't marry you
because of my father'. As it turns out, Frank Vitale (James Caan) is an
influential figure in the mob. Gina wants to avoid any involvement
Michael could have with the rest of the `family'.
While I won't deny that Mickey Blue Eyes is consistently amusing, it
doesn't have the great comedic tag team of Robert DeNiro and Billy
Crystal that gave Analyze This it's extra juice. However, casting
remains a bright spot. Grant, although displaying marginal range, is
delightful in the vital role of Michael. When he's forced to create an
alter ego his mob ties, the character of Mickey Blue Eyes is concocted.
Seeing Grant attempt to speak Mafia jargon (`No R's,' advises Frank.
`And replace the T's with D's') is truly hilarious. James Caan makes for
a worthy adversary, and although he is not the perfect choice for the
role, his veteran craftsmanship (gained from The Godfather) helps a
great deal. The only tiny loose end is Tripplehorn, who plays her role
too aggressively to be likable. Although admittedly attractive,
Tripplehorn lacks the vibrance and charisma needed to fill the shoes of
Gina.
The supporting cast is full of familiar faces that generally populate
mob movies. Burt Young is dignified and effective as Uncle Vito, the
head of the family, but there is never any humor explored in his
character. Joe Viterelli (hilarious as the bodyguard in Analyze This)
has a similar role as Vinnie. But again, his character is played far too
straight - particularly when considering what a successful stretch he
had in the previous film. The remainder of the cast is made up of a
troupe of gangster types you would expect.
Director Kelly Makin (Kids in the Hall) often takes the easy route for
the humor, but the accomplished stars only make it funnier. There are
lots of double-crosses and plot twists towards the end - mainly
involving the FBI at a final wedding ceremony - but most are entirely
predictable. Still, this is pretty funny stuff. The script is fast and
efficient enough to make us forget certain character problems, and the
gags are often expertly polished. It's not like we haven't seen this
material before, but the charm and overall appeal of the actors is
difficult to resist.
How does this stack up with Analyze This? Well, basically the same,
except for one small detail: Mickey Blue Eyes is probably better
equipped with more crowd-pleasing moments. And Grant and Caan nicely
compensate for the loss of DeNiro and Crystal - mostly a fair
comparison, if you ask me.

MICKEY BLUE EYES  (1999) ** 1/4 Directed by Kelly Makin,Written by 
Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn. Photography, Donald E. Thorin. 
Editing, David Freeman. Production design, Gregory Keen. Music, Basil 
Poledouris. Produced by Elizabeth Hurley and Charles Mulvehill. 
Cast: Hugh Grant (Michael Felgate), James Caan (Frank Vitale), Jeanne 
Tripplehorn (Gina Vitale), Burt Young ("Uncle" Vito Graziosi), James 
Fox (Philip Cromwell), Joe Viterelli (Vinnie), Gerry Becker (Agent 
Connell), et al. 102 minutes. PG-13
The FBI, the media and statistics claim that the Mafia in America has 
finally lost its blood and is but a shadow of its former self. Maybe 
so. But the gangster genre in movies and TV is alive and well. The 
films are fiction, and from the looks of the recent Analyze This and 
the current Mickey Blue Eyes, the latest tendency is gansgster 
comedy. Not that it is a new genre. (Let me put in a plug for the 
very underrated Oscar (1991), from a French play. It was directed  by 
John Landis. Sylvester Stallone played Angelo Provolone)
Gangsters, lawmen, and historical events in films (both fictional and 
biopics)  are seldom accurate--though this does not harm the 
excellence of many productions. The recently deceased Mario Puzo made 
no bones about his books and scripts (The Godfather, The Sicilian, 
The Last Don, etc.) being imaginary creations based on research and 
not at all on familiarity with gangsters. So, from there to gangster 
comedy, the gap is not really big.
Here Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) plays an urbane, very British 
auctioneer at a Manhattan house which tries to emulate Sotheby's. The 
start of the film is a most amusing auction of paintings, with witty 
remarks by Grant. There follows the lovey-dovey introduction of 
schoolteacher girlfriend Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), leading to 
a sequence at a Chinese restaurant, a comic imbroglio involving a 
fortune cookie. Grant proposes marriage. To his dismay and 
bewilderment, Gina, without giving a reason, refuses and runs off.
These preliminaries,  whatever their entertainment values, run  too 
long, muddling us, along with Grant. The plot, in a round-about way, 
has him meeting Gina's father Frank Vitale (James Caan) at the 
latter's restaurant. Michael is  too naive and dense to catch on to 
the blindingly obvious fact that Frank & Relatives & Friends are 
big-time Mafiosi. It takes an elucidation by Gina to reveal that the 
family is a Family, that her refusal comes from her conviction that, 
if she marries Michael, Frank & Co. will inevitably involve him in 
their activities.
Heroically in love and undeterred, Michael presses on, gets engaged, 
and unwittingly
becomes the recipient as well as the giver of "favors" with the Mob. 
The plot escalates into complications which involve paintings by a 
disturbed scion of the group, messy art auctions, a labor union, the 
FBI, money-laundering, a dotty rich old lady, the accidental killing 
of a Family member, quid pro quos regarding the presumed killer, and 
more. Several of these sections are funny while, at the same time, 
most of the black humor is forced. But neither the overall structure, 
nor any of  the single episodes is believable or convincing. What 
started out as a rather sophisticated reminder of the auction with 
Cary Grant in North by Northwest, is transformed into an unholy 
tangle of broad-to-blatant gags, incredible coincidences and an 
outrageously messy, confusing last act (the wedding).
In spite of feverish twists and action, the movie lacks 
verisimilitude, continuity and coherence. Sinews too,  partly because 
of its structure, partly because, in this aptly-named Simian 
Production, Hugh  Grant apes himself by playing the familiar dazed 
and confused, passive and predictable Hugh Grant, a boyish ninny as 
opposed to our recollections of the suave, appealing, active Cary 
Grant. Mickey is as far as can be from the holy simplicity of Alfred 
Hitchcock's productions.
Curiously, within the limits and confines of a silly movie (the title 
of which refers to a Midwestern mobster whom Grant is forced to 
impersonate), there are several bits of good acting. Paradoxically, 
while the Family members are caricatures and cliches to a great 
extent (at least to those of us who are not familiar with the Mob), 
there is some realism behind it all. And it is good to see again, 27 
years later,  another Mafia performance by James Caan who played 
Sonny Corleone in The Godfather.
The bottom line is that Mickey Blue Eyes is not a good movie, yet, 
mega-warts and all,  it is quite watchable, mostly for a plethora of 
gags. The visuals are fine, well supported by the profuse, ironical 
use of old Italian-American songs (vocals and instrumentals), mostly 
pop classics, with, if I am not mistaken, some contemporary Italian 
items.

 Just imagine you're a suave, proper British auctioneer who's
madly in love with an exuberant New York schoolteacher you've known
for only three months, so in love, in fact, that you propose marriage
- only to have her burst into tears and run away. That's what happens
to Hugh Grant at the beginning of the story. Jeanne Tripplehorn
refuses to marry him because she's worried about what will happen if
he joins her dysfunctional Mafia family. Undaunted, he goes to Little
Italy to find her father - that's James Caan - at his restaurant, "The
La Trattoria," where the song "We Are Family" plays in the background
as he meets the wiseguys. Sure enough, before the bumbling Brit knows
it, his auction gallery is being used for mob money laundering and the
FBI is paying a visit. The scene where the gregarious Caan tries to
teach the refined Grant the goombah enunciation of "fuhgeddaboutit" is
a gem. One complication leads to another and soon he becomes known as
"Mickey Blue Eyes" by all the wrong people. Screenwriters Adam
Scheinman and Robert Kuh and director Kelly Makin deliver the
humorous, if cliche-ridden set-ups, but what makes the frenzied farce
work is Hugh Grant, who seems to have inherited Cary Grant's ability
to maintain an unflappable charm and graceful dignity no matter how
humiliating the circumstances. Whether he's a boyish "Notting Hill"
book seller who falls for a movie star or a proper, innocent
Englishman who behaves with aplomb when finds himself with a bloody
corpse, Grant handles his fish-out-of-water roles with witty,
sophisticated charm, adept at both verbal sparring and physical
antics.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Mickey Blue Eyes" is
a funny, funny 8.  This engaging romantic comedy is perfectly timed
for late summer laughs.

     Nobody does Hugh Grant like Hugh Grant.  The urbane, slightly
sheepish, self-deprecating poise, the adorable, floppy-haired,
twinkling-eyed good looks, the Englishness worn simultaneously as an
apologetic scarlet "E" and a badge of honor -- it all adds up to an
original and satisfying screen persona.
     In "Mickey Blue Eyes", the gag is to juxtapose that character against
a very different ethnicity and style: the Mob.  It's a good gag, and Grant
uses his considerable skills to keep it light and funny for a nice stretch
as the movie gets underway.  He's Michael Felgate, director of a posh
Manhattan art auction house whose biggest problem is surly truckers who
make late and incomplete deliveries.  When he gets engaged to Gina Vitale
(Jeanne Tripplehorn), daughter of a mobster (James Caan), that problem
miraculously disappears.  But his real problems are just starting.
     At first Gina refuses him because she doesn't want him mixed up in the
family business.  He thinks he can handle it.  Boy, is he naive.  Soon he's
up to his French cuffs in money laundering, and his and the movie's
problems multipy when the stakes are raised with a murder.  Director Makin
doesn't seem up to that change of gears.  Laughs continue intermittently,
and there are some good ones, but the sureness is gone.  The movie offers
situations that want to be hilarious, as with a confusion of signals
involving an old lady at an auction, but neither the setup nor the payoff
rise to the occasion, which cries for Monty Pythonesque abandon.
     There's not much olive oil in the veins of Tripplehorn's Mafia
princess, and not much chemistry between her and Grant (there's more
between Grant and Caan.)  The Italian-American actors who make their living
as celluloid mafiosi are comfortable in their familiar roles.  
     "Mickey Blue Eyes" coasts after a funny start, and can't find its
rhythm when the plot takes a darker turn.  But it gets out of the gate
fast, and with Hugh Grant in the saddle it provides plenty of laughs along
the way.

It seems the mafia movie has become a genre unto itself, whether it's a 
heavy crime drama or a spoof.  Certainly, politically incorrect jokes are 
not dead at the turn of the century, as we see in Kelly Makin's "Mickey Blue 
Eyes."
Indeed, the funniest parts of the film come when cultures clash.  Michael 
Felgate (Hugh Grant), an Englishman running an art auction house in New York 
City, collides with Italian-American toughs with results that keep the 
chuckles coming.  Michael's future father-in-law is Frank Vitale (James 
Caan), and the scenes in which Frank tries to impose phrases like 
"Fuggedaboudit" and "Get oudda hee" atop Michael's dignified accent are 
hilarious.  (They would have been even better had I not seen them six or 
eight times in trailers!) Of course Michael finds the entire mob culture 
repulsive, but even though he has promised his fiance Gina Vitale (Jeanne 
Tripplehorn) he would shun this culture at all costs, he finds himself 
assumed into it.
Family boss Vito "The Butcher" Graziosi (Burt Young) has arranged for 
Michael's delivery trucks to arrive on time, you see.  Michael is so naďve 
he does not realize the reason for the rare promptness and contrite demeanor 
of the truck drivers.  We can predict that Michael will be called upon 
sometime, someday, to return Uncle Vito's favor.  It comes in the form of a 
request to auction the horrifically violent, religious-themed canvases of 
Vito's son Johnny, who paints as part of his therapy.  The schtick 
surrounding Johnny is humorous because of his personality: the man embodies 
the pathology of jealousy, confronting every man who glances in the 
direction of his girlfriend.  Unfortunately, Michael actually takes 
commission from the sale of Johnny's first painting - which draws him 
inexorably deeper into the mire of crime, especially as the Graziosi family 
is laundering money through these sales.
Will Michael marry Gina?  After all, she has apparently avoided immersion in 
criminal activities all these years, while caring for her father and brother 
after her mother's death.  And Michael can't seem to avoid being sucked into 
the lies and dark activities moments after introducing himself to the 
family.  Anyhow, the tension builds at the same time more laughs are 
delivered, and the ending is happy if somewhat predictable.
Hugh Grant is not as debonair as Cary Grant, but he has similar innocent 
charm.  Michael seems so likable because he is genuine, and we feel involved 
in his touchy dilemmas.  He is an especially naďve Everyman, receiving 
punches in the stomach from the over-friendly doorman of Gina's building, 
playing along with elaborate lies and morbid schemes, many the machinations 
of Frank Vitale.
Jeanne Tripplehorn plays her part superbly.  She shows just the right 
amounts of sweetness and doubt, joy and anger.  We feel for her strongly 
when she is inadvertently involved in a dark twist of family fate - although 
her noble boyfriend is willing to take the fall for her.
As Frank Vitale, James Caan is believable but a bit disappointing.  I've 
seen this veteran actor on talk shows, and in real life he seems more 
capable of the arch exaggeration of behaviors that would have put Frank 
deliciously over the top.  Frank is a loving father and family lieutenant 
with years of experience, but a touch more goofiness would have fashioned a 
funnier tone in many scenes.  Here director Kelly Makin shouldn't have been 
afraid to let Caan improvise a little!
The soundtrack of the film is highlighted by Italian-oriented novelty songs. 
  We hear "Mambo Italiano," Dean Martin's suave crooning, and many others - 
all pieces that add to the fun.
The film is rated PG-13 for mild language, and mostly for crime-related 
material, such as bodies being carried in trash bags and buried near the 
river.  There is also a brief scene full of innuendo, poking fun of British 
habits in lavatory stalls.  Good for kids 12 and over.

Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne Tripplehorn
Directed by Kelly Makin
Running Time: 1 hour 42 minutes
After the astounding success of Notting Hill, Hugh Grant returns to the
screens again in this humorous comedy. Hugh Grant 'plays' (although he
always just acts as himself) Michael Felgate, an auctioneer. He proposes to
his girlfriend Gina (Tripplehorn) who refuses. Michael tries to find out why
she won't marry him, and it turns out the problem is her dad, Frank (Caan)
who is a member of the mob. Grant tries to sort the situation out so they
can get married, but soon gets himself tangled up in all sorts of trouble
with the mob, passing himself off as 'Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes from
Kansas City.'
Although nothing particularly special, with an almost television movie feel
about it, Mickey Blue Eyes has a good sense of humour and enough charm to
get itself through. The film relies heavily on Hugh Grants shtick as the
stuttering Englishman, and thankfully the film survives because of this.
Although Grant tries nothing new, apart from an hideous Italian accent, he
charming enough to hold the audiences attention, and gets us through the
film. The same can't be said for Tripplehorn, however, who gives an uneven
performance. There's little chemistry between Grant and herself, and I
couldn't care less if Grant would get back with her. She comes off as a
little irritating, and not very watchable at all. James Caan, despite his
limited screen time, is fun as the mobster father, and a large supporting
cast of Italian stereotypes are fun enough to make sure the plot keeps
going.
The plot itself is nothing special, and the script is also uneven to make
this film truly funny. Mixed in with some funny lines are some obvious,
horrible gags that raise a groan rather than a laugh from true predictably.
The screenwriters, Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn, could of thrown in a few
more gangster film references, and apart from the Godfather theme playing in
the background during some scenes, there's a distinct lack of parody. The
writers also seem to have a problem with the non Italian supporting
characters, with James Fox's character being a stumbling British plot
element that serves little purpose but to power a few gags and get the silly
ending to work. He's nothing more than a plot device, which is a shame. In
fact, only Grant, Tripplehorn and Caan get any meat in the roles, the other
Italians look like they could provide many laughs, but the writers push them
to the side.
The direction, from Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy director Kelly Makin, in
bouncy enough, and keeps the plot moving. Most of the gags provide a smirk
and a smile, but none are laugh out loud funny. Although Mickey Blue Eyes is
good fun, there's an odd air about the film that it could of tried a little
harder, rather than relying heavily on the cast, Grant in particular, to get
the laughs.
Still, with it's fun performances, some good jokes and a nice soundtrack
with the usual Italian tunes mixed in, Mickey Blue Eyes is a good vehicle
for Hugh Grant, and provides 100 minutes of amusement. Well intentioned fun.

It's easy to see what initially attracted Hugh Grant to this
rather disappointing comedy.  His character, an effete Englishman who
becomes involved with the Mob, is familiar stuff, virtually a
composite of most of the characters he has been playing since his
breakthrough role in Four Weddings And A Funeral.
Grant plays Michael Felgate, an auctioneer with a British firm
operating in New York.  When he proposes to his girlfriend, local
school teacher Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), he is disappointed when she
tells him that she can't marry him.  Her father (James Caan, best
known for his role in the classic The Godfather) is a prominent
gangster, and she doesn't want him becoming compromised by that world,
where one small favour leads to another, and so forth.  Michael
convinces her that he will not be seduced by the mob and that he can
refuse any offers they may care to make.  But slowly, he finds himself
drawn into their world.  Before long, Michael finds that the auction
house is being used by the mob for money laundering purposes.
Complications set in when a mobster's son is accidentally murdered,
and Michael finds himself pretending to be a tough gangster from
Kansas.  Eventually he is forced to co-operate with the FBI in order
to survive a mob contract and get to the church on time.
 
Following other comedies that have dealt with the mob and its
murderous ways and codes of honour (Married To The Mob and the recent
Analyze This, etc), Mickey Blue Eyes is a second rate comedy that
struggles for genuine laughs.  Writers Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn
lack any sense of irony, and squander many opportunities to send up
the clichés of the genre.  The film becomes less likeable, less
credible and less funny as it unfolds.  Canadian director Kelly Makin
struggles to lift the lacklustre material, which moves along at an
uneven pace.
The performances lack spark.  Grant does his usual by the
numbers performance for much of the film, but he is out of his depth
when called upon to impersonate a gangster.  Even Caan seems
embarrassed here, and he struggles to milk as much ironic humour out
of his comic portrayal of an archetypal gangster as De Niro did in the
far superior Analyze This.  James Fox is totally wasted as Grant's
foppish boss.
Grant has established himself as a likeable star of light
weight romantic comedies, and it will be interesting to see how his
career fares after this disappointing and heavy handed farce.  But,
since he and girl friend Liz Hurley produced the film through their
own production company, they have no-one to blame but themselves for
this disaster.

Those looking for a nice, cute, and funny romantic comedy can stop right here.
Mickey Blue Eyes is another movie that examines the Mafia with a comic flair,
the first film of these kind being Analyze This. Since this film is PG-13, we
miss out on a lot of the things that made Analyze This a great movie. (Heavy
use of the f-word, shootings, etc.)  Not to mention that this film centers
itself on being a romance rather than just a funny comedy.
Michael Felgate (Grant doing his usual bumbling English thing that has served
him so well in the past) is an auctioneer who thinks that he’s finally found
the love of his life. He’s known Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) only three
months, but plans to pop the question to her at dinner. He does, and she’s
horrified, she says that he can’t marry her, even though she loves him. She
runs away. Michael goes searching after her for a reason.
It turns out that Gina’s father is Frank Vitale (Caan) who is the head of a
local crime family. Gina says that no matter how you resist, they will somehow
get you to join their crew, and she doesn’t want that to happen to him. But
sooner or later it does. Michael is forced to auction off a terrifying painting
created by one of the Mafia men, only to have it bought back by the same men of
organized crime. This money laundering scheme is just the beginning. Soon
Michael is disposing of dead bodies, auctioning off even more interesting
paintings, and is posing as a thug from Kansas City named Mickey Blue Eyes
(hence the film’s title).
Everyone in the film plays well off one another. James Caan goes throughout the
entire picture looking as if he’s slightly lost, but still does a good job in
the movie. Jeanne Tripplehorn has a throw away role as the woman who will still
forgive Michael after all he’s done. But Hugh Grant (who was in Notting Hill
with Julia Roberts and other English productions) is the star of the show, and
his antics (surprisingly) can carry an entire picture. Joe Viterelli (who
appeared in a very similar role in Analyze This) also has a great supporting
performance.
This is a very simple film that takes it’s premise and twists it every
possible way that it can. For this reason, I think that it can never get more
than a B+, but I still enjoyed it. Much of the humor just keeps getting crazier
and crazier, and while we’ve seen most of the stuff here before, (the film is
nowhere near groundbreaking), the movie is still a whole lot of fun. Rent
Mickey Blue Eyes tonight, and enjoy a couple of laughs.
Overall Grade: B                 Rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some
violence and sensuality.
The Young-Uns: This film contains two f-words and some other language. There is
also a heavy focus on lying and shooting people. There are also  some shooting
scenes, but they won’t be hard for anyone to handle. Good Age: 12 and up

A single delivery truck attempts to give this film a good name ("Ross
Movers") during the opening sequence. Unfortunately,the goods are a day late
and a dollar short -- how apropos of the film itself.
Hugh falls for Jeanne. Jeanne's pop (Caan) is Mafia; ditto for rest of the
males in her family. She fears for the corruption of her soon-to-be hubby.
"Mickey Blue Eyes" is the step by step account of that corruption. This
occurs in a rather unstructured way that gives the film little movement
until the third act (last half hour) in which an interesting and amusing
sting plan is conceived, flubbed, and twisted.
Poor editing plagues the picture, especially in the first act. A scene in a
Chinese restaurant could have been funny, but falls on its face due to
poorly-timed and over-abundant edits. Dry-whitted Grant is cute and
charming, but trudges through painfully flat film moments that made me
wince.
The handful of times that Hugh tries to act like a tough New York Italian
gangster are really quite entertaining. They may, in fact, be the most
amusing moments of the film. But they are a rarity in this back and forth
love story, Mel Brooks-like farce, "Get Shorty"-wannabe picture.
Starring Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan.
Directed by Kelly Makin. Written by Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn.
Produced by Elizabeth Hurley and Charles Mulvehill at Simian/Castle Rock.
Rated PG-13.

         When it comes to comedy, timing is essential. And for "Mickey
Blue Eyes," the timing could hardly be worse. Although it's a generally
agreeable farce, much of its material was already covered six months ago
in the snappier "Analyze This," making "Mickey" look like a weak
imitation.
 It hardly helps that "Mickey" also includes many of the same
supporting players and even some of the same songs as director Jonathan
Demme's "Married to the Mob," which tackled almost exactly the same
subject matter 11 years ago. Replace Michelle Pfeiffer's character in
"Mob" with an eager-to-please Hugh Grant, tone down the darkness of
Demme's humor and you've got "Mickey," which might as well be titled
"Engaged to the Mob."
 That's the situation Grant's character, an auction house
manager named Michael, finds himself in when he proposes to
schoolteacher Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn). She loves him, but she
dreads the prospect of marriage, since that would tie the squeaky-clean
Michael in with her father (James Caan) and his shady business
associates, all of whom know the proper way to dispose of a corpse and
the best tactics to use in strong-arming truck drivers.
 At times, it looks as if "Mickey" might find a tone of its own.
Certainly there's some fun to be had at the sight of the very English
Michael struggling to sound like a gangster from the Midwest -- his
attempt at a Kansas City accent lands somewhere between Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Forrest Gump -- or trying to help his future
father-in-law by unloading some incredibly ugly paintings as a way of
laundering money. Grant, who has had some bad luck in his movie choices
since "Four Weddings and a Funeral," proves here that his comeback in
"Notting Hill" was not just a fluke. He's charmingly befuddled
throughout the film.
 But most of the time the farce seems forced and the story
contrived. The best scene, involving mixed up fortune cookies in a
Chinese restaurant, comes ten minutes into the film and as "Mickey"
trudges along, the spaces between the laughs become longer and longer.
Even a feeble attempt at a twist ending isn't enough to put the picture
back on track. "Mickey" could have used more offbeat characters like
Maddie Corman's overzealous and overemotional photographer or Scott
Thompson's amusingly clueless FBI agent. Or how about surprise cameos by
Robert DeNiro or Michelle Pfeiffer? That would have really made "Mickey
Blue Eyes" worth watching. James Sanford

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Solidifying 1999 as the Year of the Mob Comedy, Mickey Blue Eyes is not
quite as well-structured as this spring's Analyze This, or as
substantial as HBO's much-lauded series The Sopranos.  But it is full of
several charming performances and very entertaining, nonetheless.
Hugh Grant (Notting Hill) stars as Michael Felgate, a British art
auctioneer at a New York City Sotheby's clone.  Despite not having yet
met the family of his girlfriend Gina (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn,
Very Bad Things), Michael decides to propose after only three months of
courting.  He pops the question via doctored fortune cookie and is
shocked when Gina gets up and flees the Chinese restaurant in tears
immediately following the proposal.  (Not to quibble, but Gina and
Michael had reservations at a finer bistro and didn't make it on time to
keep them - so where did he get the fortune cookie message?)
Thinking that she may have gone to her father's restaurant, Michael
heads to The La Trattoria (meaning, literally, `the the restaurant') and
meets Gina's father, Frank Vitali (James Caan, This is My Father), as
well as a myriad of other shady Sicilian characters.  Although everyone
hits it off nicely, Michael becomes a bit suspicious when he stumbles
upon a frosty gentleman in the freezer while trying to find the
bathroom.  He is also able to track down Gina in the bedroom of her
childhood home  complete with Duran Duran poster  where she explains
that her fear is that her connected family members will somehow corrupt
her honest and naďve man.
Gina has good reason to worry.  The next day Michael's art deliveries
are early for the first time ever, thanks to freshly rejuvenated
Teamster drivers.  He thinks nothing of it until Frank suggests that
Michael help auction the painting of the son of his mob boss (played by
Burt Young, Rocky).  The picture depicts Jesus wielding an automatic
rifle while executing what appears to be a mob-like hit.  At that
evening's auction, the painting is sold for $50,000 to someone
resembling the man in The La Trattoria's freezer.  Within twelve hours,
the FBI is questioning Michael for money laundering.
Sadly, Mickey follows the trend of current films by revealing most of
its funny moments in the trailer  especially when Frank tries to teach
Michael to drop the stuffy British accent to become Kansas City Little
Big Mickey Blue Eyes, a hard-ass Italian gangster. A talking stuffed
gorilla has some of the film's best lines, and Burt Young can elicit
laughs just from peering out from behind his super-thick Harry Caray
glasses.
Mickey's less-than-stellar production pedigree makes the film even more
surprisingly enjoyable.  Writers Adam Scheinman (Little Big League) and
Robert Kuhn (The Cure) have crafted a nifty little script that, frankly,
could have used a little less of the romantic plot and a lot more
cursing.  Director Kelly Makin (Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy) packed
the cast with alumni of Analyze This, The Sopranos and HBO's other
fantastic drama series OZ, as well as Kids cast member Scott Thompson.
Caan is wonderful as Frank, and it is truly a joy to watch Grant's
Michael abandon his sheepish, puppy-dog schtick while breaking dozens of
laws trying to cover his own tail.  Unfortunately, Joe Viterelli (the
scene-stealing Jelly from Analyze This) is completely underused in his
role.  For that, we will have to wait for the sequel, Analyze
ThisAgain.  (1:42 - PG-13 for some adult language, mild violence and
slight sexual content)

RATED:            PG-13 for brief strong language, some violence, and
sensuality
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       1 Corinthians 15:33, Proverbs 27:17, Proverbs 1:10-16
I don't know if I would say that Hugh Grant (NOTTING HILL) is a great
actor, but there is no doubt that he's a great personality.  For the
second time this summer, Mr. Grant goes to the romantic comedy well and,
once again, completely wins us over with his charm and self-effacing
humor.  He doesn't show us anything new, but when the familiar works so
well, what does it matter?
In MICKEY BLUE EYES, Hugh Grant is Michael Felgate, the manager of an art
auction house, who is head over heels in love with Gina Vitale (Jeanne
Tripplehorn, SLIDING DOORS).  But soon after Michael "pops the question"
(in an extremely funny scene set in Chinese restaurant), he learns that
Gina's father, Frank (James Caan, THE GODFATHER) is involved in the family
business... a family whose members are named after types of food
preparation (as in Vinnie the Butcher.)
Even though he gives his assurance to Gina that he will never be drawn
into her family's world of crime and corruption, he did not anticipate
that their world might come to him.  He quickly finds himself
unintentionally entangled in mob business.   When an accident results in
the death of the son of mob boss Uncle Vito (Burt Young, ROCKY), Michael
tries, with the help of his future father-in-law, to not only extract
himself from future dealings, but also to avoid being "whacked" himself.
As with ANALYZE THIS (now out in video), much of the humor of MICKEY BLUE
EYES comes from the incongruity of a "normal," decent man trying to fit in
with the caricatured personas of mobsters, racketeers, and hit men.  Add
Mr. Grant's cultured English accent contrasted against the
Italian-American Brooklynese of Gina's family and this fish-out-of-water
story becomes a whale of a comedy.
In what might arguably be considered the funniest moment in the film,
Frank coaches Michael on how to sound like a gangster, as he has to try to
pass himself off as "Mickey Blue Eyes" from Kansas City.  The result is an
hilarious accent that is completely unidentifiable.
As he was with NOTTING HILL, Mr. Grant is ably supported by a talented
cast.  James Caan gives a very strong and amusing performance as a man
torn between his love for his daughter and his loyalty to Vito and the
mob.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is lovely as Michael's intended Mafia princess.
Burt Young is appropriately "godfatherish" in a comically understated way.
Joe Viterelli (ANALYZE THIS) adds yet another Mafioso role to his resume,
which by this time must resemble a 'Who's Who List of Wise Guys."
The film was produced through Simian Films, the company founded by Mr.
Grant and Elizabeth Hurley (AUSTIN POWERS).  It was directed by Kelly
Makin (BRAIN CANDY: KIDS IN THE HALL)
Hugh Grant's character finds himself immersed in a untenable position
because he failed to heed the Gina's advice.  She had predicted what would
happen:  "A little favor, a tiny lie, and you're theirs."
Her point was valid, and a cautionary tale for us.  Her concern was that
once "the family" did a small favor for Michael, or if he accepted a small
token from them, an unspoken obligation would then exist.  A debt that
could never be repaid leading to an offer that could not be refused.
This is why we should always be extremely careful with whom we associate
and to whom we become "indebted."  As the scriptures say:
"Do not be misled: Bad company corrupts good character." 1 Corinthians
15:33 [NIV]
God never tells us to tolerate evil or coexist with it.  We are told to
avoid, eschew, and resist it.  In contrast, we are told to seek out and
fellowship with those spiritually strong in heart and mind so we may
benefit from their strength.
For any actor who wishes to grow stronger in his ability to properly make
a romantic comedy...he merely needs to seek out and learn from a guy by
the name of Hugh Grant.
