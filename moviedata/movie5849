The Escort (1997) NO STARS out of ***** - Running Time: 90 minutes.
Yet another direct-to-video, stupid erotic thriller. Get this plot though:
15 or so years ago, one girl tries to kiss another girl, making the other
girl feel "uncomfortable". As a result, the girl who attempted the kiss
commits suicide. Flash forward to now. The dead girl's sister has become a
high-priced call girl and one day sees an ad in the newspaper for a room for
rent. As it turns out, the room is being rented out by that very same girl
who didn't want to be kissed 15 years earlier. This sets the hooker's
sinister plans of revenge into action, a plan she's been working on for 15
years.
Now the sister becoming a whore, how does that fit into the ultimate plan of
revenge? It's never a factor into anything (well, except to add pointless
sexual scenes to the already stretched thin plot). And what would she have
done if there was never an ad in the paper, or if she missed reading the
paper that day? Are we supposed to believe that her whole plan was to become
a slut, read the paper every day for 15 years, answer every ad pertaining to
a room for rent, and just hope that one day her target happens to place an
ad, so her elaborate scheme can finally begin? Come on! [R]
