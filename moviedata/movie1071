     Love for the game of basketball -- and for women's basketball in
particular -- fills virtually every frame of Gina Price-Bythewood's LOVE
AND BASKETBALL. The first-time filmmaker grasps the frustrations of female
athletes struggling against societal expectations and limited
opportunities to make their passion part of their lives. She gets inside
the head of a basketball player as she makes split-second game decisions. 
She even does something I never expected to see in a sports film,
something that sent this hoops purist into a rapture: She has her heroine
win a big game not by taking the last shot, but by taking an offensive
foul.
     Yes, Gina Price-Bythewood knows her ball, and she knows the
psychology of women who love the game. She knows them well enough that it
makes up for the sluggish narrative to which she attaches them. The story
begins in 1981, where the Wright family moves in next door to the McCall
family in their Los Angeles neighborhood. Middle-school hoops junkies
Quincy McCall (Glenndon Chatman) and Monica Wright (Kyla Pratt) instantly
develop a competitive love-hate relationship, one that reaches full bloom
when Quincy (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa Lathan) excel for their high
school teams. That relationship turns more to love than hate in college,
but their personal lives begin colliding with their hoop dreams. While
Quincy's desire to follow in his father Zeke's (Dennis Haysbert) footsteps
to the NBA is complicated by a startling revelation, Monica's professional
aspirations collide with notions of femininity espoused by her housewife
mother (Alfre Woodard) and even Quincy himself.
     LOVE AND BASKETBALL gets off to an appealing start with the
adolescent tug-of-war between Quincy and Monica. There's a nice scene in
which the two 11-year-olds go from first kiss to knock-down brawl in the
space of a few seconds, neatly summarizing the competitiveness that will
sabotage their mutual attraction. Price-Bythewood is interested most
strongly in the second-class status of women athletes, and the fierce 
attitude Monica develops as she struggles with the tacit disapproval of
her mother and the awareness that her quest to be a pro may be over before
it begins. Sanaa Lathan does a wonderful job as Monica, capturing the
moping tomboy, the uncertain teenager and the ever-more-confident athlete
with strength and grace. It takes a special performance to lend
credibility to wild swings of emotion. Lathan nails every twist in
Monica's life journey.
     Monica is such a dynamic individual presence that she overwhelms
almost everything else in LOVE AND BASKETBALL. In theory, the film follows
the careers of both Quincy and Monica equally, but it's always evident
where Price-Bythewood's heart is. Quincy's character is far less
interesting from the outset, since he's already a high school star. When
Quincy and Monica get together, Price-Bythewood lets Quincy off the hook
by not exploring the blow to his ego when Monica's fortunes begin to
eclipse his own. Nearly every time Quincy or his family are drawn into the
story, there's a palpable loss of energy, a more predictable arc to the
drama. The "love" part of LOVE AND BASKETBALL starts to feel tacked on for
the sake of convention. Making it a story with two equal protagonists
repeatedly makes it evident that Price-Bythewood doesn't understand Quincy
nearly as well as she understands Monica.
     LOVE AND BASKETBALL is structured in four time period segments over
some dozen years, each segment identified as a basketball "quarter." By
the time the film draws to a close after two hours, you may feel as though
it has gone into at least one overtime. Gina Price-Bythewood builds a
sense of the epic into the relationship between Quincy and Monica, but
there's always the sense that it would have been much more effective as a
smaller, more intimate story. It's a very good film when it focuses on one
woman's attempt to create a happy personal life that also includes the
game she loves; it's pretty mediocre when it tries ineffectively to give
equal time to the men. It may be my long-standing affinity for women's
basketball talking, but I wanted a film about the one character in which
the filmmaker clearly had the most emotional investment. Women finally
have a basketball league of their own; it shouldn't have been too much to
ask to give them a basketball movie of their own.

In watching movies like SOUL FOOD and THE WOOD, I saw Myself--as in, the 
larger Black community in which I came up--as I rarely have on the 
Silver Screen these days: everyday folk with dreams, aspirations, trials 
and tribulations, existing within a rich culture having little or 
nothing to do with the stereotypes of Black life put forth by far too 
many ignorant White--and Black--filmmakers too eager to compromise Our 
reality for a paycheck.
But in LOVE AND BASKETBALL, and in its protagonist, Monica Wright, I saw 
shades of myself--as in, me--that were startlingly refreshing, and in a 
sense, cleansing, to see.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
LOVE AND BASKETBALL is a tale of two friends who share the same hoop 
dreams: Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan), a "plain girl" who wants to become 
the first woman in the NBA, and sets aside everything in her personal 
life to achieve that goal; and Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), a popular star 
on his high school and college teams, whose climb to the top is less 
blocked than Monica's is.  Or is it?  
Monica's banker father Nathan (Harry J. Lennix) supports her efforts, 
but her mother Camille (Alfre Woodard) doesn't understand Monica's 
"tomboy" ways.  Q finds himself situated between his bougie mother Mona 
(Debbi Morgan) and father Zeke (Dennis Haysbert); a pro player himself, 
Zeke tries to keep Q focused on becoming an educated man, while trying 
to hide a few skeletons in his own closet.  As a struggling point guard 
Freshman, Monica quickly bumps heads with her Coach, as well as Sidra 
(Gabrielle Union), an upperclassman who is also a point guard.  And as 
Quincy and Monica's friendship turns into something deeper, they also 
have to face the fact that pro basketball may not be quite what either 
of them expected--or even obtainable.
The Upshot:
To say "I loved this movie" would be an understatement.  I felt more 
strongly about last year's THE BEST MAN, but "Love" resonated with me in 
a way that even "Best Man" couldn't touch.  
The fellas were tight in their acting.  Omar Epps' capable turn as Q was 
to be expected; Epps has long been a solid actor, and his performance 
here was no exception.  A bit more surprising was Dennis Haysbert's 
outstanding performance; he and Epps played well off each other, and his 
Zeke character provided a welcome spark to this film (as well as an 
important message to the aspiring pro ballers in the audience).  
Haysbert has definitely come a long way from his MAJOR LEAGUE days.  The 
exception to the "strong males" rule was Harry J. Lennix; Nathan was 
pretty much mute, though Monica clearly identified more with him than 
she did her mother Camille.  It is unfortunate that his character wasn't 
given much to do.
But the women were, for me, what made this movie. Sanaa Lathan was 
nothing less than excellent as Monica; her passion for the game, and her 
passion for Q, were drawn out beautifully.  Equally believable as a 
young woman experiencing her "first time", and a more mature, sensual 
woman playing "strip basketball", Lathan's all-too-brief love scenes 
with Epps brought Black Sexuality back to the mainstream movie audience 
as it hasn't been shown since JASON'S LYRIC way back in 1994.  Alfre 
Woodard tears it up as a mother grossly underestimated by her daughter, 
especially near the end; Woodard is simply powerful, even in "small" 
roles.  Debbi Morgan, whose movies as of late (especially EVE'S BAYOU) 
have made audiences all but forget her time on daytime soaps, was 
somewhat overwrought as the Done Wrong Wife; it's too bad that some of 
the time spent on her character wasn't devoted to Nathan and his role in 
Monica's life instead.
And the Chick at the helm, writer/director Gina Prince, was strongest of 
all.  Her performance here is reminiscent of John Singleton's strong 
entry into feature filmmaking (BOYZ IN THE HOOD), but only in the sense 
that they put out such good works in their rookie year.  That, and the 
fact that both are Black directors, is where the comparison ends; life 
in Singleton's "Hood" was vastly different than Prince's vision of Hoop 
Life.
And speaking of her vision, it was realized in innovative ways.  Prince 
takes advantage of the basketball theme by breaking the movie into 
"quarters" ("First Quarter: 1981"; "Second Quarter: 1988"; and so on).  
She also used background music well (starting with Al Green's "Love And 
Happiness"); it's generally historically accurate, but more importantly, 
the music plays a real role in the movie, almost as if it were a 
character.  This contrasts greatly with most modern hip hop-flavored 
flicks, where the music only provides a means to selling the soundtrack 
(and it's usually "music inspired by the movie").  Prince's use of 
"first person" shots during one of Monica's games, provided a unique 
perspective on that character's situation.  And as writer, Prince put 
mostly believable words in her character's mouths; the actors made those 
words come to life, and the collaboration between writer/director and 
cast, was wonderful to witness.
My one big issue was the turning point in Q and Monica's relationship.  
I had a very hard time believing that the thing which changed their 
relationship (trying to avoid spoilers here) would've really done so; 
since they both were in very similar situations, there's no way one of 
the characters should've been so pigheaded as to huff and puff 
about...that thing.  While not a big enough issue for me to downgrade 
the movie's rating, it's a flaw that could've been easily addressed by 
Prince giving the characters a different conflict to stress over.
Well, actually, there's another big issue I have with this movie.  Turns 
out that it had a little something to do with The "Black Factor"--and in 
how a fellow reviewer, saw it.
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Making a long review even longer, and even though it's probably not good 
manners to do so, I feel driven to include and respond to this snippet 
of a pretty good review of LOVE AND BASKETBALL by Morgan Fouch, quoted 
in TNT's "Roughcut" newsletter:
   "A more interesting movie would have focused on her and the 
    injustice that women athletes face in male-dominated sports 
    where they are unable to compete professionally or be taken
    seriously by sports fans, writers and financiers. But to 
    appease a non-discriminating black audience and to sell 
    tickets, the love story, sports sequences and a hip soundtrack 
    were thrown up front, drowning a potentially good film." 
           -- Morgan Fouch about LOVE AND BASKETBALL
My first reaction was to get snippy about this snippet, even though I 
hadn't yet watched the film, nor read the entire review, at that point.  
My second reaction, after reading the review and realizing that she's 
not only a Black woman, but also someone whose work I've read and 
respected in the past, was a bit more subdued, though I still took issue 
with the bit about "a non-discriminating black audience".
My third reaction?  Past the curiousness of her reaction to the love 
story and sports sequences (it *is* called "Love And Basketball", after 
all), she's Wrong. "Wrong" I say (in my highly- opinionated way of 
thinking) because as I saw it, there was attention given to Monica's 
plight, and on how Q's "red carpet" was vacuumed by the Monicas of the 
world.  Perhaps not enough direct focus, but the best filmmakers show, 
not tell; and for me, the contrast between the crowds and TV cameras at 
Q's games, and the small audience at Monica's, underscored the Female 
Factor quite well.
But still, We have been lackadaisical in supporting quality Black 
movies--like this one, I opine--while crowding theaters the country over 
to see unadulterated "Booty" crap.  While *some* of Us are certainly not 
part of that "non-discriminating black audience", too many of Us are.
Which leads me to my final reaction: she's also Right.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
It's lovely when a film starring and made by Black folk can be held up 
as an example of good moviemaking, without the "...for a Black film" 
addendum.  That it could also tell a love story without resorting to 
"Booty Call"-ism, is icing on a tasty chocolate cake.

Susan Granger's review of "LOVE & BASKETBALL" (New Line Cinema)
        First-time feature film-maker Gina Price-Blythewood scores
with this romantic drama told in four quarters. Sanaa Lathan and Omar
Epps play two young athletes from Baldwin Hills, an upper middle-class
black neighborhood of Los Angeles. Friendly adversaries since
childhood, they share a mutual passion for basketball. In high school
and college, Epps is set to follow in the footsteps of his famous
father (Dennis Haysbert), an NBA player, while Lathan battles her own
inner conflicts involving the rough 'n' tumble reality and inequities
of women's ball. Conformity is an anathema to her. I found this
feminist aspect of the film particularly compelling since she's
struggling to become an independent woman, as opposed to the life
chosen by her more subservient mother (Alfre Woodard) who did not have
the same opportunities available to her. Then Epps must face his own
personal disillusionment - and becomes involved another woman, making
Lathan wonder if "being all about ball" is really worth the price that
must be paid. Quite simply: this is a coming-of-age saga in which
assumptions and idealism are challenged and re-focused - on the court
and off. Unfortunately, the predictable plot is tied up too
simplistically, like a contemporary Cinderella tale. But the
performances are uniformly good, particularly Sanaa Lathan who proves
herself an actress of formidable intensity. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Love & Basketball" is an uneven but satisfying 6,
particularly as a date movie. Spike Lee, who serves as producer, has
introduced yet another exciting, new African-American film-maker in
Gina Price-Blythewood.

Financed by Spike Lee's Forty Acres and a Mule production company, Love
& Basketball is too much like Spike's recent flicks - excessively long,
agonizingly self-indulgent and full of nails-across-a-blackboard music
from Terence Blanchard (Summer of Sam).  And that's really a shame 
there's a nice little film in there somewhere, if you pare away about
thirty-five minutes.
Basketball is divided into four uneven segments labeled `First Quarter,'
`Second Quarter,' etc.  The first takes place in 1981, where the world
of eleven-year-old Crenshaw kid Quincy McCall (Glenndon Chatman) is
rocked to its alpha-male foundation by the fact that he may no longer be
the best basketball player on his street.  Q's new neighbor  like him,
a wannabe point guard  has silky-smooth moves, a killer jump shot and,
more importantly, is actually a tomboy named Monica Wright (Kyla Pratt).
 Hey  haven't we already seen a girl move to a new town and dress like
a boy this year?
Flash to 1988, where both Q (Omar Epps, In Too Deep) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan, The Best Man) are star playmakers for their respective Crenshaw
High teams.  She loves Magic Johnson and wears his #32, while his idol
is his dad, who sports #22 for the L.A. Clippers.  They're still
neighbors (their bedroom windows are only about ten feet apart) and they
bicker like an old, married couple.  It's sweet to watch Q and Monica
pretend that they don't care a lick about each other when it's obvious
that they do.  A romance eventually blossoms after a spring dance.
Basketball's third (and longest) quarter sees Q effortlessly making the
move from high school to the starting line-up at USC, while Monica
struggles just to make her Lady Trojan team.  This is where Basketball
is at its best - contrasting Q's red carpet journey to instant college
fame and adulation with Monica's sweaty workouts featuring teammates
that hate her and a coach that rides her ass raw every day.  According
to Dick Vitale (who makes a cameo performance along with fellow ESPNer
Robin Roberts), Q is a real P.T.P. Diaper Dandy (meaning  I think -
that he's a freshman with incredible potential).
The last chapter of the film is set in 1993, and what little faith I had
remaining for Basketball's denouement was ripped out from under me.
There is entirely too much time spent on the relationship between each
set of parents and their talented little ballplayers.  You know when Q's
moms (Debbi Morgan, The Hurricane) warns him about money-grubbing hoes
trying to `trap' him that she's probably done the same to his NBA star
pop (Dennis Haysbert, Random Hearts), while Monica's prissy parents
(Harry J. Lennix, Titus and Alfre Woodard, Mumford) just don't
understand how important basketball is to their daughter.
Basketball was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, who made
two unseen Dave Chappelle comedic shorts called Damn Whitey and Bowl of
Pork, the latter of which a black take on Forrest Gump (`Life is like a
bowl of pork'  get it?).  Until now, Prince-Bythewood was probably best
known for being the daughter of accomplished television director Stan
Lathan.  She even adds a clip of Pop's latest sitcom The Steve Harvey
Show.  Prince-Bythewood's script is heartwarming at times, but as a
whole is unfocused and uneven.  If there was more of the relationship
between Q and Monica (like the priceless look of shock when he unfurls
his package before they git wit' each other for the first time), the
film would have been a lot more enjoyable.  There are a couple of pretty
cool shots through Monica's eyes while she's on the court in the middle
of a game.
There are other mildly endearing qualities to Basketball, like the use
of different music from each period of the film.  First you hear Bobby
Brown singing `Candy Girl' with New Edition, and then `My Prerogative'
on his own seven years later.  It's funny, but not nearly as funny as
hearing people use the word `fresh' repeatedly.  There are other minor
problems with the film as well.  Like why would these people live in
Crenshaw?  Isn't that supposed to be a bad area?  Wouldn't an NBA star
live somewhere else?  Their houses are huge and one even has a giant
in-ground pool.  Maybe I'm just ignorant (I already have plenty of
e-mail supporting this point, so save your typing fingers), but Crenshaw
is always portrayed as a gang war zone in films set in south central Los
Angeles.
In addition to not having opening credits (a growing trend in mainstream
film), there is another interesting event that happens early in the
film.  Woodard's character coughs in her first scene, which is usually
the first sign of a character developing lung cancer in the last reel.
But that doesn't happen here, which almost makes me think that this
story was originally intended to drag out even longer than it already
did, and the whole cancer angle (thankfully) ended up on the cutting
room floor.  Or, then again, maybe Woodard just coughed and the director
didn't feel like reshooting the scene.

When you read your horoscope, there always seems to be
a passage about waiting for stars and planets to
align.  Supposedly, when this finally occurs,
something joyful and magical will happen.  For a few
glorious moments, everything seems to fall into place.
 But celestial synchronization doesn't happen too
often.  The planets continuously move along their own
distinct orbits.  They are at the mercy of the sun's
gravitational forces.
This cosmic representation might be what
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood saw in creating
this charming film about a girl, a boy and their
delicate relationship.  `Love and Basketball' tells
the story of Quince (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan), two childhood friends from two different
worlds that want to be together but are inexorably
pulled in different directions by the forces of
basketball.
We first meet these two as young tykes at the local
playground.  Despite his youth, Quince already shows
the promise of a future star.  He doesn't think that
girls can ball,' but Monica shows that she can move,
dribble and shoot as good as he.  Quince doesn't like
this at all.  He is clearly irritated, yet he is also
fascinated with her abilities.  An unlikely friendship
is born, forged together by basketball.
The film now fast-forwards to their High School senior
year.  Each of them has immeasurable basketball
talent, but Monica's off-the-court situation is much
different than Quince's.   She struggles to convince
her parents that she is not wasting her time with the
sport, she struggles with her on-court bad attitude
that keeps her benched, and she struggles with finding
the heart that makes her a standout player. 
Basketball is her life, yet her future is always full
of uncertainty.  Quince, however, benefits from having
a father who is an NBA player, is gaining notice among
the scouts, and seems so sure that he's destined for
greatness that he's almost casual about it.
Through the years, the two remain close friends but we
detect a hint of romance.  Alas, basketball's forces
keep them from connecting.  Quince, now a hero for the
USC men's basketball team, finds that girls are
throwing themselves at him.  It is difficult to resist
this kind of temptation.  Meanwhile, Monica attends
the same college and plays for the women's team.  She
is committed to elevating herself from being a scrub
on the roster, which may mean neglecting Quince during
a critical time of need.  Throughout their college
lives and even in the years beyond, they drift closer
together and then further apart, only to see this
cycle repeat.  Their individual journeys are uniquely
poignant, and eventually force them to ask some
important questions.  Was their something missing in
their lives?  Can love and basketball co-exist?  These
are the tough questions that they'll continue to
explore throughout this amiable film.
`Love and Basketball' has a stately, epic feeling as
it follows Quince and Monica over more than ten years
of their lives.  We see their personal fight to be
professional players and their attempts at finding a
medium between the forces of love and basketball.  The
story also poetically incorporates a storytelling
device that can be likened to momentum shifts in a
real basketball game.  Divided into four parts (the
movie refers to these as quarters'), each act is set
during a different time period of their lives.  In one
act, we see Quince enjoying fame while Monica weeps in
the face of failure.  In the next sequence, it is
Monica who begins to rise while Quince begins to fall.
 We're never quite sure if Quince and Monica will ever
connect, but it will be joyful and magical if these
two stars finally align.

This film takes the court with all the fervor, spark, and talent a crowd
loves to see in an underdog. Playing a fantastic first quarter and scoring
from every corner with flashy moves; the film nearly secures an "A+" by half
time. But like a team satisfied with a dominating lead, it just runs down
the clock in the second half.
New neighbors, a couple of ten-year-olds, shoot some hoops. The innocence of
their youth drives though the shaky defense - in this case a jittery camera.
The boy is cocky, albeit uneasy about a girl in HIS sport. The girl is
tough. Eventually embarrassed by the "female," the boy shoves her to the
ground. And so begins a beautiful romance that teeters on the rim between
love and basketball.
Older now, Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan, are still the best of friends by high
school, whether they're dating each other or not. Of course, we know they're
in love ... but do they?
The film's dialogue is excellent, fresh, a high percentage deliverer. Sanaa
asks her sister, "Ever been in love?"
Sister: "Yeah."
Sanaa: "Ever been loved back?"
Sister: "Sure ... after I cut 'em off."
Kudos to the casting director are in order as well. The younger ballers are
very believable (and talented) matches to their teen successors. Apt at the
sport, Epps and Lathan (Sanaa learned the game in preparation for the film)
can still handle the screen. Epps is an outstanding actor, if you agree,
check out "The Wood" and "Best Man" on video. Lathan (also in "Best Man") is
captivating, strong and lovely in her bull-headedness.
I love the direction in this movie (second half excepted). John Swanbeck,
director of "Big Kahuana" said (in our recent interview), "faces will be my
landscape." Writer/Director of "Love and Basketball," Gina Prince-Bythewood,
(an athlete herself) paints mountains of emotion with her actors' eyes and
speaks mouthfuls with their bodies. In another example of her directing
finesse, we play 30 seconds of the game from the point of view of Lathan,
hearing her thoughts, seeing what she sees. It's great first person
basketball.
Unfortunately, what seemed to be a formulaic, but nonetheless "A" level
production, strikes a lull during a "strip basketball" sequence from which
it never quite regains its momentum or timing, nor does it really climax.
Faulty story line choices also hinder the climax; the film has a tidy
ending, but fails to deliver a swell. It pains me that such problems reduce
the film's total score to "B+."
If this talented freshman could just have kept its head ... "Love and
Basketball" would have made it to the championship game. Still, it's a
memorable production, and I'll be looking forward to future efforts from
these gifted people.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member James Brundage.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/d6f25ebcc3d22783882568c20010bfac?OpenDocument
 Of all of the projects for Spike Lee to attach his name onto, Love and
Basketball may go down as one of the most idiotic.  Lee produced this
Hoop Dreams meets Romeo and Juliet love story and his largest mistake by
far was to hand the position of director over to Gina Prince-Bythewood.
Prince may have made four films, but she still hasn't gotten it quite
right.  And, from the looks of it, she won't be getting it right anytime
soon.
 Love and Basketball concerns Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan), a basketball
loving girl who wants nothing more than to be the first woman in the
NBA.  Her next door neighbor, Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) is the son of a
NBA player and wants nothing more than to follow in his father's
footsteps and get some booty along the way.  When he realizes (at about
age 18) that the booty he has been wanting all along has been living
next door, he quickly hooks up with her.  Both find themselves going to
USC and both find themselves on the USC basketball teams.
 At this point, you are a half hour into the movie.  The remaining hour
and a half is wasted on the will-they-won't-they as their romance
becomes turbulent, then nonexistent, and then turbulent again.  It is
also wasted on Monica's undying quest to become the first female NBA
player, and the hardships that she must face as a woman who loves
basketball.
 All of this ardent feminism is a great thing, but placed in the inept
hands of screenwriter and director Gina Prince-Bythewood it turns into
an excuse to attempt to further a story about love.  If Love and
Basketball focused on its romantic aspects and removed the failed
attempt to make the story have three plots (Quincy's career, Monica's
career, and Quincy and Monica) then it might just have ended up being
entertaining.  Instead, it ended up being very trite and very tiring.
Add to this already faulty film the fact that it is told in quarters,
three of which take place in the 1980s, and you often end up feeling as
if you are watching the basketball game from hell with retro music on.
 The only things that make this movie even close to bearable are the
excellent performances by its two leads.  Epps, who has been on a good
streak since his role on "ER" takes a low-grade stock character such as
Quincy and makes him into someone we can stand to watch for two hours.
Lathan positively shines as Monica almost making an unwatchable
character into something I can look at for the duration of the film.  If
it weren't for the two of them, I might have been tempted to walk out.

LOVE AND BASKETBALL is a terrible title.  As soon as you hear it, you
expect the movie to be another lame, teenage romantic comedy, which are
a dime a dozen at the cinema with most as forgettable as last week's
lottery numbers.
I'm happy to report that writer/director Gina Prince's LOVE AND
BASKETBALL is an ambitious and successful film that isn't a teen comedy
at all, although the two charming leads, Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps, do
pass through their teen years as part of the story.
Another delightful surprise about the film is that the writer takes an
African-American cast and avoids the clichés that most such films of
late have fallen into.  Either they bulk up on stupidity and profanity
(as in TRIPPIN') or they gloss it up so much (as in LOVE JONES) that the
characters are completely unbelievable.  In LOVE AND BASKETBALL, both of
the main families are genuine with real aspirations and challenges.  And
both of the leads are endearing and eminently likable.
LOVE AND BASKETBALL tells the poignant story of two basketball players,
one of each sex, who are next-door neighbors.  Following a basketball
metaphor, the writer divides the movie into four quarters of their lives
with several years passing between each period.  We watch the players
progress from grade school to high school to college to pros.  Even if
the trajectory of their lives has some predictability, the details have
one surprise after another -- just like real life.
When we meet Monica Wright, she's an 11-year-old, pigtailed,
self-proclaimed tomboy, played with spunk by Kyla Pratt.  She wants to
play basketball with the boys since theirs is the only game going.  The
star of the local playground is her neighbor, Quincy McCall (Glenndon
Chatman), the son of NBA star Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert).  Quincy
decides that Monica will be his girl, so they agree upon a 5-second kiss
to seal the deal.  He counts off his seconds like a referee at a
wrestling match.  But, this first romance of theirs doesn't last long.
>From high school to the pros, the leads are played by the same actors,
Sanaa Lathan as Monica and Omar Epps as Quincy, and they are believable
across the entire age range.  To be fair, Lathan steals the show from a
charismatic Epps.  Rather than have both characters be superstars, the
script wisely imbues them with different skill sets.  Both are dedicated
to their game, but being the star player comes naturally to Quincy,
while Monica is a fighter who just barely gets a college offer.
The chemistry between the two is interesting and unusual.  By the time
they reach high school they have effectively become siblings.  When
Quincy's parents fight, he crawls into Monica's window and sleeps on her
floor.  Monica is a one-man or no-man woman, and in high school she
dedicates her life to her sport.  Dating is foreign to her, and her
clothing and hair choices proclaim "not interested!"
Not surprisingly, they eventually become lovers, and you would be
disappointed if they didn't since they clearly need each other and are
so right for one another.  Their lives, however, will go across many
rocky roads.  The pros, in particular, will not be quite what they or
you might have imagined.  Along the way the movie teaches some important
moral lessons, but it is done subtly and never ends up feeling like
Sunday school.
With two stars that you come to care about deeply, the movie's ending
isn't unsatisfying just because it contains a fair amount of
predictability.  But, like the rest of the story, the writer manages to
sneak in lots of little surprises.  By the end, it's kind of hard to
believe that Monica and Quincy are fictional.  And I, for one, would
very much like to hear about their next 4 quarters.
LOVE AND BASKETBALL runs 1:58.  It is rated PG-13 for sexuality and
language.  Although the profanity was reasonably mild, some of the
sexuality stepped over the bounds of what one would reasonably expect to
find in a PG-13 film.  Losing one's virginity, even if we are shown that
they practice safe sex, does not belong in a PG-13 movie.  Absent this
scene and a couple of others, however, it certainly deserves a PG-13
rating.  But with these scenes I do not think it is appropriate for kids
under 13 or 14.

IN SHORT: a color blind GenX dateflick
Tracking the life stories of two childhood neighbors as they age and
make their way towards lives as professional basketball players, Love
and Basketball is the movie producer Spike Lee wanted last year's The
Best Man to be, a flick staffed by an African-American cast whose appeal
is color blind. That may be because what little rap slang is in the
flick is easily translatable by middle aged white guys like Cranky or
because stories of true love, in which the couple to be don't
necessarily like each other for most of the story, are old hat and don't
require much to figure out way in advance. That leaves the question of
whether there is chemistry between the stars (there is) and whether the
performances are interesting enough to sustain you (they are).
The bigger problem with writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood's creation
is that she slaps soundtrack songs over the action (literally) every
five minutes or so. This may be a wonderful marketing tool for the
soundtrack CD, which often outsells box office tickets, but it's
irritating as hell to a grownup audience. Which would be me. At least
the [PG-13] rating means the soundtrack free of obscenity laden rap
songs. Cranky can't vouch for the CD.
Starting in 1981 at age eleven, we meet Quincy McCall (played as a
youngster by Glenndon Chatman), son of NBA star Zeke (Dennis Haysbert)
who is determined to follow in his dad's footsteps, with his dad's
number on his back.  The just moved in tomboy neighbor Monica Wright
(ditto Kyla Pratt) who is determined to be the first femme player in the
NBA and is already kicking out enough punk attitude fit to put any
competitor in his place. Their first game results in physical damage to
Monica. Their first relationship lasts about fifteen seconds. This
"first quarter" of the movie lays out all that follows. Jump forward to
senior year in high school, where Quincy (Omar Epps) is the hoop star
and hottest high school prospect in the country. Monica (Sanaa Latham),
still reeking of attitude and lacking in team spirit, can't get a
recruiter to look her way. The parental units on both sides (Haysbert
and Debbi Morgan; Alfre Woodard and Harry J. Lennix) both want their
kidlets to get an education; the McCalls knowing that a pro career is a
temporary fix at best, the Wrights knowing that there's no foreseeable
place for a woman in the NBA.
The story continues into college, where both play for USC, and beyond.
With one plot twist to keep it all interesting, you can figure out
Prince-Bythewood's story with a careful analysis of the above paragraph.
If you don't want to expend the brain power, everything to come should
ring clear as a bell about halfway through the flick.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Love and Basketball, he would have
paid...
A average dateflick for the teens and GenXers is what Love and
Basketball is. There's little here to interest us old farts.

   The only touch missing from this sweet, poignant,
wonderfully acted and directed romance is the voice of Judy
Garland on the soundtrack singing Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin's
song, "The Boy Next Door."  Truth to tell, neither of the two
entirely sympathetic, nay, charismatic characters can ignore
each other, living literally a hop, skip and jump (which they
sometimes do) from each other's bedroom window.  In a
stunning directorial debut, Gina Prince-Bythewood directs this
Spike-Lee produced Cinderella story with a fairy-tale ending
that pretty much sums up the connection between two
notions heretofore strange to each other, love and basketball.
   The ball is in the court of the two players who often make
each other jump through hoops rather than admit their mutual
affection.  The enchanting Sanaa Lathan performs in the
starring role of Monica Wright, a woman whose notions of
feminism may be half-baked particularly when criticizing her
mother's attention to cooking, but who without reading Gloria
Steinem or Helen Gurley Brown feels deep down the
importance of being an independent woman.  Monica would
be considered a tomboy back in the fifties, and in fact some
viewers may call her that even today though progressive
parts of the world recognize highly physical sports as no male
monopoly. Monica has her mind set on dribbling, jumping,
running.  Scoring for her means something different from
what it means to a macho man.  Her next-door neighbor in
the affluent black Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills
is Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), likewise a person who exists
for love of the game, and one who only on some
subconscious level realizes that he and Monica love each
other even at the tender age of eleven.
   Prince-Bythewood divides the movie fittingly enough into
quarters, each segment devoted to an aspect of the lives of
these two ball players over a period of some twenty years.  In
the pre-teen phase young Mnica (Kyla Pratt) asks young
Quincy (Glenndon Chatman) whether she can join the game.
Not long after that Quincy asks the young gamin, "You wanna
me my girl?" to which she replies in all naivete, "What do I
have to do?"  Quincy thinks only that this obligates her to ride
the handlebars of his bike--which Monica, in a fit of autonomy
that will see her through the next two decades--simply
refuses to do.  As they mature, both will learn that the
unformed idea of independence leads only to loneliness and
that each, in turn, must indeed do something for the other if
they are to become a team with a fighting chance to win life's
game.
   While the 27-year-old Omar Epps is long in the tooth to be
playing a high school kid--who seems not to age through the
years--he is ideally cast as the sometimes petulant athlete
who will turn pro and have to fight off the groupies.  Sanaa
Lathan effectively exchanges emotions, her eyes displaying
her loneliness when she is recruited by a pro women's team
that plays in Barcelona, jealousy and profound sadness when
she learns of Quincy's engagement to be married, ecstasy
when involved in a hot game or when she appears close to
getting what her heart desires.
  In the side roles, Alfre Woodard is an excellent Camille
Wright, the mother of Monica, who has had to give up her
dreams when she became pregnant but who finds happiness
in keeping up her lavish home and counseling her often
difficult daughter.  A compelling subplot that mirrors the
dominant one involves Quincy's dad, Zeke (Dennis Haysbert),
who has been caught with his pants down by his unhappy
wife Mona (Debbie Morgan) and who, in the fashion of Arthur
Miller's Willie Loman loses some of the awe with which his
son had always regarded him.  One grade-A lesson that
Monica learns occurs in college, where she considers herself
perpetually picked on by a coach who never lets up on
criticizing the young woman's plays.  "When I ignore you,
then you worry," says the fierce coach, an object lesson on
the adage that the opposite of love and concern is not anger
but indifference.
   "Love and Basketball" has a fairy-tell ending as Quincy,
about to marry another, goes one-on-one with Monica for
stakes that are far higher than a league championship.  This
is an effectively done moment of fantasy that brings a
sincere, realistic, mature and thoroughly human romantic
drama to a close.  What positions "Love and Basketball"
several points over the recent black endeavor, "The Best
Man" is its absence of phoniness, of kitschy scenes designed
to evoke cheap laughs.  While the brief scenes on the court
are well-executed, "Love and Basketball" is a movie that uses
the game as a metaphor for life, a contest between two
opposing wills whose main object is not victory but
sportsmanship, good will, mutual affection and grounded
behavior.

Mac VerStandig's radio review of the film will air on WTPN-Radio on
April 21, 2000---
Love and Basketball is a mawkish, overly-poignant and clichéd movie that
mindlessly bounces along without ever making a clear statement. For the
majority of the two-hour running time, the latter half of the title watches
from the bench as the picture makes a faulty bounce-pass at romance and
family values in the court of life. At the end, the viewing experience is no
more pleasurable and just as frustrating as rooting for the
destined-to-be-annihilated-opponent at a Harlem Globetrotters game.
As the `first quarter' (the movie voluntarily divides itself into four
quarters that are as even in length as Muggsy Bogues and Gheorghe Muresan
are in height) begins, we meet Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan), the new girl on
the block who is as much a tomboy as her older sister is a beauty queen. She
aspires to be the first woman in the NBA and will, ultimately, have a career
in basketball. But first she needs to overcome the preconceived notion,
which her mother happily lives, of a woman belonging in a kitchen  not on
the basketball court.
Before long, Monica is accepted in the neighborhood and befriends her next
door neighbor, Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), who also aspires to NBA greatness.
But for Quincy, the road is much more inviting with the aid of a father who
is already playing in the league that so many youth dream of joining. As the
two grow up together, their romance fades in and out with their destiny of
belonging with each other being painfully obvious to everyone but the two
aspiring athletes. Such relationships have grown tired on screen thanks to
other abysmal films like Drive Me Crazy and Whatever it Takes and this duo
do little to wake up the device.
As the quarters go on, the two children's personalities change possession.
Monica ceases to be the over-aggressive, tempestuous tomboy that she was and
finds a happy medium in life while Quincy turns away from the romantic,
understanding traits he had grown up with and allows his ego to take over.
There is little surprise when such turns take place as it can be expected
that any athlete who turns pro in the movies (Quincy enters the draft after
just one year of College) will develop such self-importance and any person
who struggles to find acceptance (Monica doesn't break the gender barrier in
the NBA), becomes humbled and wise overnight.
As the two become young adults, they round out their clichéd lives with
family conflicts. Monica struggles with her mother who prefers to see her in
a dress and pearls than a jersey and headband while Quincy is forced to deal
with his father's unbiblical behavior with a female fan. These excess
subplots do little to move the film through its two hours and could be as
easily disposed of as Michael Jordan's baseball career.
The one place where the film does score points, sometimes at least, is in
the game of morals. Writer/director Gina Prince does her predominately
teenage audience a favor in showing the young couple use a condom when they
first engage in intercourse. There is also a minor emphasis put on the
importance of education although it may well be too little to late to have a
real impact. Still, better some positive traits then none.
As you have probably gathered, the game of basketball takes a back seat to
the game of life in Love and Basketball. Although I applaud the film for not
feeling the need to use a dramatic last-minute buzzer-beater, something that
too many films these days overuse, I find it ironic that this movie might
well be one of the few that could benefit from such action.

_Love_&_Basketball_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Film genres don't come more basic and predictable than the love story
and the sports movie.  Love story: soulmates run into countless,
sometimes trivial, obstacles en route to "happily ever after"; sports
movie: athletes must overcome physical and (mostly) mental hurdles to
achieve their crowning glory.  As one can glean from its no-frills title,
_Love_&_Basketball_ doesn't break much, if any, new ground within its
genres, but writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood approaches the formula
task with such intelligence and sincerity that it's petty to complain.
The most refreshing wrinkle to _Love_&_Basketball_ is its
straightforward treatment of women's sports, a subject that is rarely
covered without a special angle.  The female athlete here is Monica
Wright (Sanaa Lathan), a naturally gifted basketball player who continues
to grow and mature in her ability as she works her way up from the high
school ranks to the college ranks.  Following the same path, albeit in a
more flamboyant fashion, is her longtime neighbor Quincy McCall (Omar
Epps), son of NBA journeyman Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert) and a shooting
star in his own right.
_Love_&_Basketball_ is the story of two passions: Monica and Quincy's
passion for the game and also their passion for each other. 
Prince-Bythewood comes up with an ingenious way of melding these two
through the film's structure: like a basketball game, the film--and,
thus, the development of their relationship--is broken down into four
quarters  The two meet as 11-year-olds (played by Kyla Pratt and Glenndon
Chatman, respectively) in the first quarter (set in 1981), and after some
typical boy-girl hostility, they grow to become friends.  The second
quarter covers the pair's (now played by Lathan and Epps) senior year in
high school, when they become a couple.  The third quarter traces their
turbulent freshman year at USC, when their shared passions end up
conflicting with each other, setting the stage for the 1993-set fourth
quarter, which catches up with the two after college.
The scope of the film is ambitious--it also touches on their
less-than-smooth relationships with their parents, not to mention the
rocky relationship between Quincy's mom (Debbi Morgan) and dad--but
Prince-Bythewood keeps the focus simple.  All told, _Love_&_Basketball_
is nothing more than the story of two people who love each other--and I
mean people, not just characters.  Monica and Quincy are
multi-dimensional people, with their own individual strengths,
weaknesses, and dreams.  In an average movie, the script would have to
manufacture complications to pull them apart, but the problems the two
face are firmly rooted in who they are..  It could be said that the
biggest obstacle in their relationship is the one big obstacle faced by
couples in real life: each other's fundamental imperfection as human
beings.
Adding immeasurably to the authenticity of the film--both the sports
story and the romance--are Epps and especially Lathan.  Epps again proves
to be a consistently solid performer; he's charismatic, likable, and more
than up to the role's athletic requirements.  The revelation here is
Lathan, whose most high-profile role to date had been as Taye Diggs' love
interest in _The_Best_Man_.   Lathan is extremely convincing during
Monica's many hoops scenes--an accomplishment made more impressive by the
fact she could not ball worth a damn when she was initially cast.  Her
most glorious accomplishment, however, is her heartfelt dramatic
performance.  Monica carries the greatest emotional weight in the film,
and Lathan brings the role natural depth and nuance.  Even when the
formula mechanics of the film start to show, Lathan lends the proceedings
a crucial air of reality; she obviously believes in the material, and the
audience finds no difficulty in following suit.  A particularly
overwrought line has Monica telling Quincy she'll play a one-on-one game
for his heart, but Lathan makes it sound like the most natural thing
anyone can say at that moment.
_Love_&_Basketball_ isn't the most exciting of titles, but it's as
honest a title as one is likely to find gracing a multiplex marquee.  The
film indeed has a lot of love, a lot of basketball, and it delivers all
the expected payoffs at all the expected moments.  While that fact may
turn off people looking for something beyond the formula, I'd wager that
for most audiences, all that _Love_&_Basketball_ has to offer will more
than satisfy.
