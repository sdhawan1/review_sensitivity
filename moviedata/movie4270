WHERE THE MONEY IS (2000) by John Sylva, associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)
There are nurses who treat and care for their patients in nursing homes as if
they were a part of their own family.  There are nurses who volunteer extra
time out of their life, just to be with their patients.  Then, there are nurses
who go around performing bank robberies with their patients.  Well, not too
many nurses do that, but that's what the unbelievable comedic caper "Where the
Money Is" is trying to sell.  Linda Fiorentino stars as Carol Ann McKay,
nursing home employee responsible for watching over the home's newest patient,
Henry Manning (Paul Newman).  What results from a humorous, delightful setup is
an unbelievable, over the top caper flick that is moderately entertaining, but
never escapes the "been there done that" feeling that so many films of this
genre carry.
Carol discovers that her new patient was once, or possibly still is, a
well-known bank robber, who has supposedly suffered from a stroke, and as a
result, cannot communicate or hardly move.  Catching onto what seems to be a
cleverly planned scheme, she eventually tricks him into snapping out of his
stroke act, and starts to bond with the old timer, as the stroke routine was
part of his plan to pull off his next big heist.  From here, the two, along
with Carol's husband, Wayne (Dermot Mulroney), decide to go on a series of
robberies that will eventually land the team 2 million dollars.
As the film's lead, Paul Newman is hilarious in his comic portrayal of his
aging bank robber, giving a performance that is unquestionably worth watching. 
The 75 year old actor has wonderful comic timing, and steals the show, turning
what could have been a total flop into a pretty decent picture.  The legendary
Newman deserves better than "Where the Money Is," but it's apparent he wanted
to travel into his older, crime caper days with this one.
Linda Fiorentino handles several of her scenes with comic pizzaz and energy,
and falls flat as a pancake in others.  The actress can't decide whether or not
she's putting on a comedic performance or a mysterious one, changing Carol's
personality from scene to scene, resulting in her character coming off dull,
uneven, and unlikable others-which should probably be credited to the
screenplay, which gave her an unclear character.  As her husband, Dermot
Mulroney is a complete misfire, ruining almost every one of his lines with a
cocky, unrealistic tone of voice, and awful facial expressions.
Under the direction of Marek Kanievska, "Where the Money Is" is surprisingly
good in some moments; surprisingly bad in others.  Although flawed, some of the
film's laughs cannot be ignored or go unmentioned, as a few choice moments are
worth being rewound repeatedly when the flick comes to video. Kanievska wastes
much of the film's screen time, especially with a totally unnecessary, 3 minute
plus opening credit, and overly long scenes, present only to fill time.  At a
mere 88 minutes, one would think the screenplay would be from the desk of one,
first time amateur screenwriter, but "Money"'s script gives credit to three
screenwriters, E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien, and Carol Cartwright.  The three
pull off a satisfying enough work, but don't give any one actor enough to work
with in their one-dimensional roles.  Every character in the film is
under-developed, and with a little more effort and time, could have been
transformed into well rounded, likable beings.  A lot more effort and time
could have gone a long way in other areas of the screenplay as well, as the
plot jumps from too many elements in such a short time to come off with any
realism.  The film is too unfocused to be very effective, but during many
bright moments, you can tell a great movie is trying to squeeze through the
cracks.  Still, despite its few ups, "Where the Money Is" would have been
better left for the video store.
The Bottom Line: "Where the Money Is" is where the money won't be at the box
office; but it's a fine choice for a video rental.

Y'all remember that nasty Y2K thingy that everybody thought was just one 
big hoax?  Well, I have a running theory: the Y2K bug didn't infect 
computers--it wormed its way into Hollywood's cameras this year...
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino) sees her glory days behind her; her 
brightest moment having been Prom Queen to husband Wayne (Dermot 
Mulroney) as King, she now marks time as a nurse in a nursing home in 
her small town while Wayne works the night shift.
Enter Henry Manning (Paul Newman), a famous bank robber in his 
youth--before he was caught in a bank vault--Henry is transferred from 
prison to Carol's nursing home after he has a debilitating stroke.  Or 
so he wants everyone to believe.  But Carol believes otherwise. 
Intrigued by Henry and by his exciting former life, she sets out to get 
a piece of the action by trying to draw him out of his haze; and she 
goes through extraordinary lengths to do so--much to Wayne's dismay.
The Upshot:
It was surreal, going from the pleasure of almost instantly liking 
KEEPING THE FAITH, the movie I watched just before this one, to hating 
WHERE THE MONEY IS in about the same swiftness of time.  
I noticed three things about "Money", right off the bat: first, it is 
only 88 minutes long, making it shorter than most run-of-the-mill Made 
For TV Movies these days.  When I sat down to watch it, I realized why: 
"Money" is terribly edited.  The hack job done on it put me in mind of a 
rabid butcher using a dull-edged spoon to cut up his cow because his 
boss didn't think he was quite ready to use sharp utensils.  And even 
with that, I can't convey the absolute mess "Money"'s editor made of 
this movie; the cuts come so fast and furious at the beginning, I wasn't 
sure whether I was watching the movie, or outtakes of it.  The third, 
and most insulting, thing I noticed about "Money", was that the 
storyline made absolutely no sense.  I did not believe a single thing 
they were trying to "sell", not for a moment--partially because my 
husband works in Corrections and I know (at least in our state) that It 
Just Doesn't Work That Way--but mostly because I did not feel the actors 
believed it either.  
I was embarrassed for the lot of them, most especially for Paul Newman.  
I have to give him props for making something of an effort, but the 
burden weighed him down, and he looked every bit his age.  Hard to 
believe this was the same man who brought the weary yet bright-eyed Cool 
Hand Luke to the Silver Screen.  As Wayne, Dermot Mulroney played Yet 
Another Doofus led around by his smaller head.  Every time I started to 
see a light come on behind Mulroney's eyes, signaling that an actual 
character existed in there somewhere, the focus would shift back to 
Carol or Henry; and by the time the camera came back to him, the light 
would be out again.  And someone should remind the makeup artist that 
worked on Linda Fiorentino, that when a person cries, their tears 
usually run down in a straight line; they're not generally smeared 
across the face as if someone applied Fake Tearz to try to convince the 
viewer that the actress was actually crying.  
If only that were the least of Ms. F's sins.  Setting aside the 
thoroughly disgusting notion of a nurse  attempting to seduce a 
helpless, wheelchair-bound stroke victim, could there have been a worst 
choice of characterizations in her pouty, fuzzleheaded little girl who 
still somehow managed to have her way with two seemingly brain-equipped 
men?  The whole concept of Carol's character was an insult to this 
viewer; I never took her seriously, and for the life of me, couldn't 
figure out why Wayne or Henry would, either.  Thelma and Louise, she 
ain't.
Even when I dislike a flick, I generally try to give it the benefit of 
the doubt, looking for at least one redeeming factor in them, some small 
thing that I can at least grudgingly say I liked.  
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
>From what I can tell as a movie critic, the stock and trade of a good 
character actor comes when the casting director, confronted with filling 
a role calling for a specific characterization, has a Eureka Moment and 
thinks immediately of that person.  
This in mind, character actor Frankie Faison will not likely wont for a 
job, as long as mainstream casting directors keep him in mind ("we need 
a Frankie Faison type!") when they have a Smiling Older Black Security 
Guard/Cop/Hall Monitor/Teacher With Little To Do, role to fill.  Think 
back on his past few performances: has he played anything else lately?
On the other hand, at least he's one Black actor who has a "sure", 
relatively unembarrassing, part available to him if he wants it.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
A dud from start to finish.  It's a long way from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE 
SUNDANCE KID and THE STING to this horribly edited dreck.  My heart goes 
out to Mr. Newman; no legend should have to "end" his career on such a 
sour note.  Hurry up and film another movie soon, Butch, so we won't 
have this to remember ya by!
WHERE THE MONEY IS (rating: redlight): 
I can imagine the folks behind this one are asking just that: "where the 
money is?".  They'd best take it and run.  Quickly.

Its title is the famous quote attributed to robber Willie Sutton 
(1901-1980) when he was asked why he robbed banks. "Because that's 
where the money is." In reality, Willie (also known as Willie the 
Actor for his disguises) never said it. Unlike Yogi Bera, he did not 
leave a legacy of other quotes. But the apocryphal reply has been 
used time and again in wildly different cicumstances.
London-born director Marek Kanievska , has just two previously 
released features. "Another Country "(UK, 1984) comes from a 
prize-winning London play about with public schools (private schools 
in American parlance) in the 1930s, homosexuality, non-conformism, 
the real-life defection of Brits to the USSR. It was nominated for 
Best Picture at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.
"Less Than Zero" (USA, 1987) was very distantly adapted from the 
Brett Easton Ellis novel on golden youths and their dissipation. A 
peculiar coincidence: The film of Ellis's controversial novel 
"American Psycho" came out the same week as "Where the Money Is."
The skeleton of the story. Carol (Fiorentino) is a nurse in an old 
people's home in the Oregon sticks. (The town is played by areas of 
Montreal). She is sharp, lively and by now somehow aware that there's 
more to life than her job and that there ought to be more in her 
marriage with her high school sweetheart , unambitious Wayne 
(Mulrooney)
A prison bus delivers to the sanitarium chronic bank robber Henry 
(Newman) who has had a stroke. In his wheelchair, he is like a 
near-paralyzed vegetable. Carol, however, instinctively suspects that 
he is a fraud. She tries all sorts of tricks --including sexual ones 
-- to unmask him. In vain.
Eventually though,  she succeeds. Shakespeare wrote "Out of this 
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety" (Henry IV). Carol, out 
of Henry's catatonia plucks a vigorous, smart, still glamorous and 
sexy man. The purpose of his tour-de-force act as the total invalid 
is a transfer to a place which is easy to escape from.
Now being himself and laying his cards on the table, Henry, 
authoritative. suave and charming flirts and dances with Carol. She 
is not unaffected. He regales the couple with the theory and practice 
of heists. Inevitably, the patient, his nurse, and the reluctant 
husband plan a Brinks-type robbery. It nets them an armored vehicle 
and guard uniforms. The two men impersonate the money-collectors. 
Carol operates the communications system with admirable presence of 
mind.
The first part of the film is cool, laid back like Newman, and most 
unhurried. It is pleasant for the viewers to have time to watch 
developments, catch nuances and not be pushed around by the story
The second part is a savory cocktail of comedy, near-farce and 
suspense. In "their" armored car, the trio follow the scheduled 
route. Improbabilites are numerous, but the sleight-of-hand of 
script, direction and production make you forget all about disbelief 
and the suspension thereof. The suspense  comes from the steady 
changes of venues, each with its own problems and solutions. There 
are echoes of some earlier Paul Newman roles.. There might also be a 
tongue-in-cheek homage to such heist movies as Stanley Kubrick's 
early "The Killing." The genre has longevity. So do several 
pleasantly immoral films which make us root for likable rogues and 
thieves.
Paul Newman is the colorful, masterful glue that keeps things 
sticking together. By the way, he is 73 and not 75  here.The picture 
was made in  1998. Why its release was delayed for two years baffles 
me.
Newman is astonishing. Any signs of the occasional callowness of his 
youth have disppeared of course. He is, however, vibrant with 
youthfulness, energy, humor, self-control, self-confidence and 
wisdom. Still a four-star charmer.
Linda Fiorentino is also an umitigated source of joy. I cannot tell 
why exactly, but at least twice I felt that she looked like Lauren 
Bacall, perhaps because of a combination of gutsiness, initiative 
and.smarts. She is such a fast learner that anyone who has ever 
taught a class would give anything to have students like her.
The plot's movie-movie dialogue snaps and crackles. Carol cuts her 
robber teeth on her own. She gets from a small bank a bonus 
toaster-oven without opening the necessary account. Disapproving 
Henry throws it in a lake. The imperturbable lady's reaction: "It 
says you're not supposed to immerse it in water!"  Or Henry to Wayne 
who will case a joint: "Look at them in the eye. But not like you're 
going to remember their faces."
There are more small pearls of this order. They help raise the film 
from light entertainment to a solid "divertimento."

Starring Linda Fiorentino, Paul Newman, Dermot Mulroney. Directed by
Michael Kanievska. Rated PG-13.
*NOTE: This review discusses some crucial plot points that you may wish
to be left in the dark about. I recommend seeing the movie first if
you're planning on doing so. The grade is a B-. You have been duly
warned.
Where the Money Is is the feel good crime movie of the year. It's a
caper film even more lighthearted than some of Elmore Leonard's work.
It tries to please everyone by being at once a bank-robber movie, a
love story, a rite-of-passage parable and under 90 minutes in length in
one fell swoop. It shouldn't surprise many that the film fully succeeds
in only the last objective but that doesn't mean that it can't be an
entertaining failure.
Linda Fiorentino, perfectly cast, plays Carol, a reasonably happy nurse
at a local nursing home. She isn't overjoyed by her job but she doesn't
resent it either; she likes people and there could be worse things out
there for her than dealing with the elderly. One day, Carol gets news
that the nursing home is getting a new addition. It seems that the
state is running out of room in its prison hospitals so they will be
sending Henry Manning (Paul Newman), a notorious bank robber who has
suffered a stroke and is now a vegetable, to Carol's establishment.
Everyone else at the nursing home is outraged about the state forcing
its leftovers on them but Carol doesn't mind: this is just another
patient on another day.
Soon, Carol begins to suspect what we have already been told by the
film's advertising campaign: that Harry is faking his stroke. She tries
to make him come out of his hiding place within himself with loud
noises and lapdances. When that doesn't work, she takes desperate
measures. She rolls him out to the lake and pushes his wheelchair along
the dock, making it fall in the water. Sure enough, Henry climbs out,
healthy as a cucumber.
Carol is compelled to help Henry keep up his charade until he can meet
up with his partner-in-crime and run off. Carol's boyfriend (Dermot
Mulroney) becomes concerned that Henry and Carol may be becoming
romantically interested in each other. Meanwhile, Henry's partner
ditches him and Carol makes a proposal: why don't the three of them do
a little bank job of their own?
Every single thing I've read about Where the Money Is insists that Paul
Newman utterly carries the movie. I beg to differ. Newman is great, as
he always is, funny, sarcastic and always entertaining. But the real
star of the movie, in my opinion, is Linda Fiorentino. I've long
thought that she livens up every movie she is in and it is gratifying
to see her finally get a lead performance. She's 40 years old and she
is still gorgeous and her quippy, charismatic way of delivering
dialogue is perfect for this movie. Her presence in even something like
Lost in Space II would make me settle comfortably in my seat.
*The next paragraph gives away the ending. If you haven't seen the film
and are still reading this despite my previous admonition, I suggest
you bail out now.
The robbery that the three attempt in the film's last third doesn't
make much sense, but that's not really a problem. I had issues with
what happened after it: Dermot Mulroney's character is blatantly turned
into a villain and Carol jumps headfirst into a completely unbelievable
love affair with Henry. I'm not even necessarily talking about the 30
year age difference between them: we just don't feel like the two have
a future together. It seems that Henry would run away at the first sign
of trouble.
The performances really anchor the movie. It's a joy to watch the
actors even when everything else fails. The plot is a mess but its
inconsistencies are -- just barely -- outshadowed.

If Paul Newman acted in a so-so movie and nobody went to see it, would he
still be considered a great actor? You bet! Newman recently announced that
he would be making one more picture, his "swan song", and calling it a
career. Of course, everyone and their uncle wants Newman to get together one
more time with that guy who runs the Sundance Film Festival...what's his
name...something-or-another Redford. Anyway, only time will tell what will
happen to the king of popcorn and salad dressing, but for now, let's focus
on yet another movie which was filmed entirely on location in my hometown of
Montreal, Canada.
PLOT:
A lifelong bank-robber fakes his own stroke in jail so that he could be sent
to a temporary nursing home, from where he intends to find an easier route
to the outside world. Unfortunately for him, his nurse is on to his game and
ultimately ends up trying to convince him to work with her on one more bank
job.
CRITIQUE:
As I left the theater, I was still a little confused as to what kind of film
they were going for with this one. If it was meant as a crime caper, it
failed because there really wasn't much tension, suspense or action. If it
was meant as a romance or drama, it failed to a certain extent, because
there was actually very little chemistry between husband and wife, even
though Newman did manage to shine all on his own. His back-and-forths with
Fiorentino were definitely the highlight of the film. And lastly, if this
film was meant as a comedy, it didn't fully achieve its full potential
either, with only a handful of guffaws sprinkled lightly across its quick
90-minute canvas. Of course, it really shouldn't matter whether or not one
could qualify this film in any specific category, as long as the film can be
entertaining as a whole. Unfortunately for this movie, it rarely peaked any
level of interest on my part, especially after its extremely slow start and
eventual predictable story line.
Of course, I still recommend seeing it (although I would suggest waiting for
video), only because of the understated performance by Newman, who doesn't
achieve the emotional vibe that he was able to contribute to NOBODY'S FOOL,
but definitely tweaked enough of my interest, to sit through the film's
unoriginal plotline. Points also go out to Fiorentino, who had up until
recently been relegated to roles featuring her gruffy voice and fine legs
(this film also focuses on her booty), scoring with a solid performance of a
down-and-out small town nurse looking for a way out of her hum-drum life.
Her sexual appeal also decided to make a palpable appearance in this film,
with a touch of THE LAST SEDUCTION still shining through. As a whole, the
film doesn't suck by any means, nor does it bring anything exciting to the
table. It's a very generic tale of an old-time crook looking for a new
score, and a new crook looking for some old-time help. Some charm, some
laughs, zero tension, solid performances by Newman and Fiorentino, wrapped
in a so-so story. Sound interesting to you? Well, maybe you should just see
it to pay tribute to one of America's favorite actors. And no...I'm not
talking about Dermot Mulroney! :)

IN SHORT: Start-up sparks fizzle, but not a dud.
Before we start, this is the kind of review Cranky hates to write
because a flick with more positives is going to get what appears to be a
negative rating, if you are a new reader and don't understand how we
work. If that's you Click here now.
So . . . what's wrong with this picture? Nothing, actually. It's a
perfectly average story with an OK script and direction. It is pleasing,
intelligent, humorous and there's good chemistry between stars Linda
Fiorentino and Paul Newman. Once the sparks get pulled out of the story
mix, everything settles way down. The sense of elation that we expect
from an underdog getting away with the big score "caper" flick just
isn't here.
We start on a high school Prom night, for soon to be marrieds Carol Ann
and Wayne McKay (Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney), the highpoint of
their lives, before and after. Fifteen or so years later, Carol is a
rehab therapist in a nursing home and Wayne works the night shift at an
unspecified job. The fire is almost gone from their marriage, unless a
certain song by The Cars reminds them of what was probably the biggest
thrill of their lives.
Into the home, whose population seems to be 99 per cent elderly ladies,
comes Henry Manning (Paul Newman). Manning, a notrious bank robber,
suffered such a severe stroke in prison that he has been temporarily
transferred out. Slumped in his wheel chair, with only the twitch of his
left hand to indicate that anything at all is functioning within his
body, Manning is essentially dead to the world. Except that Carol starts
to notice things, coincidences if you will, that indicate to her that
Manning isn't the vegetable that he appears to be. She makes it her duty
to try to get a rise out of the man. Literally. (OK, guys. Linda
Fiorentino in a nurse's uniform. Go to town. The flick does...) Until
the lady manages to crack the man's shell, this flick is a very sexy and
very funny good time. And Newman never speaks a word.
Carol's ultimate goal is to put the thrill back in her and Wayne's life.
She's determined to get Manning to teach her how to rob the local bank,
and get away with it. Oh, and Wayne, too. When the hubbie senses that
something naughty may be going on between his wife and the con, he lays
down the law, and Manning says "No problem." From that point on, the
sexual sparks fizzle and we're left with an average caper flick.
Why didn't Manning flee the home? It's covered in the script. How did he
pull off the stroke? It's covered in the script. How does the caper come
about and is it logical that it could succeed? It's covered in the
script. Is there an inevitable twist that puts the plans in jeopardy?
It's covered in the script, a couple of times to keep things
interesting. Where's the elation you're supposed to feel when the
inevitable occurs? Heck if I know. The script has everything it's
supposed to. The direction gets from point A to point B, but all the
pizazz goes out of the story early on. It's up to the director to keep
that chemistry sparking; in this case not letting the leads have any
kind of flirtatious back and forth is deadly.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Where the Money Is, he would have
paid...
Pay per view level. My parents, retired and eligible for dirt cheap
tickets, would love this kind of flick. To those of us for whom Paul
Newman is still a big star name (like me), if there's nothing else out
there of interest you might risk first run ticket prices, if they're not
too much above what your cable system will charge down the line.

Paul Newman has announced that he will soon retire from the medium of film.
He says he wants to make a couple of more films and will retire sometime in
2001.  He also mentioned that he would like to do another film with his wife
Joanne Woodward and that would be a great swan song in the career of the
second greatest actor in the history of American cinema, behind Al Pacino.
Newman has been nominated for the Oscar eight times as an actor and has also
received a nomination for producing 1968's 'Rachel, Rachel', which he also
directed.  Newman owns three awards from the Academy, for best actor in
1986's 'The Color of Money', an honorary Oscar for his entire body of work
and the Jean Hersholt humanitarian award for his charitable efforts.  Newman
is a stand up guy, a great role model for upcoming actors and lives the kind
of clean Hollywood lifestyle others could take a lesson from.  Newman is 75
and can still act with the best of them. His part in 'Where the Money Is'
makes Newman look semi-retired and his work in the film, with all due
respect, is something he could have made more of it but he is still fine
nevertheless.
There's are two movies I kept thinking of while watching 'Where the Money
Is'.  The first one is entitled 'The Brink's Job' from 1978 and 'The
In-Laws' in 1979, both starring actor Peter Falk.  'The Brink's Job' is sort
of self explanatory by the nature of its title and is a better look at an
armoured car robbery story and is based on a true story about a famous 1950
Brink's caper that rocked the city of Boston.
'Where the Money Is' is a docile attempt to weave a somewhat interesting
plot about an armoured car robbery with the lives of those wishing for
something better by collecting the loot from it.  The film is also a cake
walk for Newman, and the rest of the cast for that matter.  This film
probably would have gone straight to video if it wasn't for the charismatic
performance by Newman who acts as the anchor for this movie and saves all of
those in front of and behind the camera from being totally forgotten.
It tells the story of a convicted bank robber named Henry Manning (Paul
Newman) who is living in a nursing home and he reportedly has suffered a
stroke and is unresponsive to anything around him.  Nurse Carol Ann McKay
(Linda Fiorentino) believes that given the past of this colourful criminal
that he's faking his ailment and she tries to prove it.  She tries to turn
on the charm by doing things like sitting on Henry's lap etc, etc.  After
getting desperate, Carol indeed proves that Henry is faking his condition by
throwing him and his wheelchair for a special kind of ride.  Carol wants to
liven up her marriage by going along on a robbery caper with Henry and her
husband Wayne (Dermot Mulroney) agrees, reluctantly, to go along with the
robbery caper and together, this threesome embark on a night of posing as
armoured car guards and heist a truck and carry out robberies by making
merchants think they're the real thing, just filling in for the evening and
their uniforms and acts of persuasion are very convincing.
The problem with 'Where the Money Is' is that it has no edge.  It moves
along well but has the look of a television movie and really has no
excitement.  It's not that it was intended that way but director Marek
Kanievska and writers E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright (why
did it take three people to write this?) have made a genteel type of movie
that you can take your grandparents to see in proud fashion on a Sunday
afternoon with little or few people in the theatre to bother you.
A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a

If Paul Newman would bottle his really secret sauce, he could make more
than an Internet IPO.  Whatever it is that he takes, it makes him look
two years younger and better every year.  And even with his white hair,
he's no blonde bimbo, he seems to get brighter with advancing age.
All of the above notwithstanding, the mere casting of Newman in WHERE
THE MONEY IS isn't enough to guarantee that the picture will be
compelling.  Any actor needs some material to work with, and the
screenplay by the writing committee of E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien and
Carroll Cartwright is sorely lacking in plot and character development.
The most impressive credentials for the latter two writers, as noted in
the film's press kit, is that Movieline in 1992 named their script for
HELLO, STRANGER as one of the top 10 unproduced screenplays.  This
reminds me of the biggest bass that I never caught.  You wouldn't
believe its size.
The setup for this three-person story is that an old bank robber, Henry
(Newman), gets released briefly from prison by faking a stroke.  With
the prison hospital full, Henry is taken to a nursing home composed
almost exclusively of elderly women.
One savvy nurse, Carol (Linda Fiorentino), figures out his con and
decides to force him out of his fake coma.  Fiorentino (THE LAST
SEDUCTION) has a take-no-prisoners sexuality that most directors shy
away from.  In one scene, director Marek Kanievska, takes advantage of
this as he has her use lap dancing to coax a little life out of Henry.
He proves a tough bird, however, who requires something more drastic for
him to break his spell than a beautiful woman rubbing against him.
As her husband, Wayne (who was the king to her queen at their high
school prom), Dermot Mulroney is given the least of all to do in an
underdeveloped script.  We know that he's a bit of a screw-up and that
he likes having sex with Fiorentino -- who wouldn't? -- but we learn
remarkably little more.
Since Henry's a bank robber by trade and since Carol and Wayne aren't
exactly in the chips, you might figure that the movie would involve a
big robbery.  If you did, you'd be right.  The robbery, however, is made
both needlessly complicated and ridiculously easy to execute.
Similarly, the film's ending is entirely too neat, unbelievable and
completely predictable.
A few parts of the movie are worth recommending.  Beside the nicely done
lap dancing scene, Fiorentino has a great short scene in which she uses
her sexual charms to overpower a young bank clerk.  This wide-eyed lad
ends up giving her a toaster oven without her having to open the
required bank account.  Personally, I would have given her two.
WHERE THE MONEY IS runs 1:28, but the film's slow pacing belies its
short length.  It is rated PG-13 for sex and language and would be
acceptable for teenagers.

The only thing worse than a dumb movie is a dumb movie that clocks in at
two hours.  Lately it seems that a running time that shatters the
120-minute mark is a prerequisite  even for films that have very simple
premises.  As a result, these interminable pictures get bogged down in
unnecessary character development and boring sub-plots.  Look at The
Skulls  it had the content of an after-school special and a running
time that rivaled the entire Roots miniseries.  Look at the upcoming
Love and Basketball  a run-of-the-mill romance that took longer to
unfold than an actual NBA game.
Then look at Where the Money Is.  The script is concise and doesn't try
to be too clever or quirky.  It's a simple story that doesn't even
threaten to present futile subplots or intense character growth.  At an
ultra-lean 88 minutes, Money is short, sweet and to-the-point.  And it's
got Paul Newman playing a quick-thinking con man  a role that seems to
have worked pretty well in the past for the blue-eyed septuagenarian.
Newman (Message in a Bottle) plays Henry Manning, a criminal mastermind
well known for selling security systems to banks, only to rob them blind
at a later date.  He's been incarcerated, but as Money opens, we learn
that Henry has just had a stroke and we see him being transported from a
maximum-security prison to a nursing home in rural Oregon.  Newman nails
the stroke victim role pretty well, as he sits slumped over in his chair
and stares into space with a slacked jaw and the occasional twitch. Wait
 that makes him sound like a wrestling fan.
Enter nurse Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino, What Planet Are You
From?) who, for some reason, suspects that Henry is faking his stroke,
which, of course, he is.  Carol is suspicious from the get-go, but Henry
never cracks, even when she bends over to reveal her pert buttocks, or
gives him a steamy lap-dance, or when she knocks boots with her husband
Wayne (Dermot Mulroney, Goodbye, Lover) in Henry's room.
Henry eventually does break (otherwise there's wouldn't be any point to
the film), and when that happens, Carol convinces him to go after one
last score, offering herself and her dimwitted husband as partners.
They target an armored car, hit a few minor snags along the way, and
then the film ends.  Like I said - short, sweet and to-the-point.
Money was directed by Marek Kanievska, who hasn't helmed a feature film
project since 1987's Brat Pack fest Less Than Zero, which, ironically,
was based on a book by Brett Easton Ellis, who wrote American Psycho 
one of the films Money is pitted against in this weekend's box office
race.  The screenplay was based on a story by E. Max Frye (Palmetto) and
was written by Frye and debut scriptwriters Topper Lilien and Carroll
Cartwright.  While their film doesn't have much substance or style, it's
still a pleasure to watch.

The keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber, the naive
ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse, and a partnership
that blossoms between the two are the fine components
that make up a modest, little caper adventure entitled
`Where the Money Is.'
The elderly bank robber is Henry (Paul Newman), a
famous criminal that was only recently caught.  He has
pulled off dozens of successful heists and has
probably stashed away a small fortune.  Always the
shrewd thinker, he begins working on a plan to get out
of jail.  This involves years of studying Buddhism and
self-hypnosis.  When he is prepared to execute his
plan, he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke. 
Now a seemingly twitching vegetable, he is temporarily
transferred to a state-run home.
Carol (Linda Fiorentino) is the nurse that cares for
him.  She's a very bright person with a good heart. 
Yet, her life is a miserable waste of time.  The most
exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars.  Her days
at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair
calisthenics.  Worse, she's in a dead-end relationship
with high-school sweetheart Wayne (Dylan McDermott). 
They became a couple because they were king and queen
of the prom.  To her, this made sense long ago.  But
now, it's a different story.  
Wayne seems equally bored with his life, but is
content enough to stay put.  Wayne's greatest ambition
is to become a night shift supervising foreman.  Carol
feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital
patients, but she's never been anywhere else and
doesn't see many other opportunities in life. 
However, when Henry falls under her care, her outlook
begins to change.
The medical reports may state that he suffered a
massive stroke.  Carol, however, begins to grow
suspicious that Henry may just be faking it after all.
 Maybe she can get through to him, and maybe she can
learn something about the money that he has stashed
away.  The opening 30 minutes are filled with
hilarious attempts of Carol trying to bring Henry
back to life.'  And what are some of Carol's
resuscitation techniques?  Perhaps an erotic lapdance
might stir his senses.  If that fails, maybe she'll
try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a
20-foot high pier into the cold lake below.
When he finally comes out of his state of self-trance,
the movie's direction changes, though it remains
equally if not more entertaining.  Carol sees that
Henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness. 
She is invigorated by his commanding presence and
refreshed by his vibrancy.  This, of course, puts
Wayne in an odd situation.  Henry and Carol's bond
grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to
rob an armored car.  Henry needs this heist because he
is unable to retrieve his original stash.  Meanwhile,
this is Carol's ticket to a better life.  Wayne is
uncomfortable with the situation, but helps out
nonetheless.  However, his lack of commitment
threatens their success.  The heist sequence is
suspenseful, well paced, and casts the uneasy feeling
that something will horribly go wrong.  
`Where the Money Is' does more to spotlight Newman and
Fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a
nifty heist.  Newman is the real joy of the film,
adroitly showing that at age 75, he's still really hot
stuff.  He possesses a sly smile, displays a
dominating attitude, and a projects a demeanor that is
undeniably attractive.   Fiorentino is also a fun
presence.  You root for her despite her sense of
amorality.  Sure, she wants to commit robbery and has
little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken
man into a lake, but we can see that to escape her
dead-end world, she needs to do something drastic. 
With two charismatic characters such as these, it's
hard to ignore that `Where the Money Is' is where the
fun is.

    When Paul Newman gets a roguish twinkle in his eye, you
know there's gonna be trouble - and that's just what happens when a
sexy, seductive nurse, Linda Fiorentino, discovers that her newest
catatonic patient is actually a bank robber who faked a paralytic
stroke to get out of prison. In this clever, unconventional caper,
Newman plays Henry Manning, a renowned thief who got caught in a
Denver bank vault during a massive power failure. Now he's playing
feeble in an Oregon nursing home, just waiting for the right time to
re-claim his life. "There's an element of Butch Cassidy in Henry,"
Newman says in the press notes, quoting The Sundance Kid's
oft-repeated line: "Keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're good at."
The problem occurs when the larceny-minded Fiorentino, who yearns for
adventure, tries to recruit him into masterminding a local heist. "I'm
playing brain-dead, not brain-damaged," he scoffs - but soon the plot
thickens, much to the dismay of Fiorentino's hapless husband, played
by Dermot Mulroney.  While Linda Fiorentino's ex-prom-queen-without-a
future character is intriguing, this is Newman's film - from beginning
to end. You can't take your eyes off him. There's a delicious scene in
which he explains, "Faking a stroke isn't easy - you gotta work at
it," demonstrating how he learned to control his reactions with a
G. Gordon Liddy-inspired lighted match-burning-his-hand. Written by
E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien & Carroll Cartwright and directed by Marek
Kanievska, it's a taut story, filled with tension and suspense. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Where the Money Is" is a low-key,
fun-filled, spirited 7, taking a cool cue from jailbird Willie
Sutton's answer to why he robbed banks: "Because that's where the
money is."

  WHERE THE MONEY IS (director: Marek Kanievska; screenwriters: E. Max
Frye/Topper Lilien/Carroll Cartwright/story by Frye; cinematographer: Thomas
Burstyn; editors: Sam Craven/Garth Craven/Dan Lebental; cast: Paul Newman
(Henry), Linda Fiorentino (Carol), Dermot Mulroney (Wayne), Susan Barnes
(Foster), Anne Pitoniak (Tetlow), Bruce Mac Vittie (Karl); Runtime: 89; USA
Films; 2000) 
A lighthearted comedy farce built around a crime caper, but is mostly built
around the star power of Paul Newman. The film misfires because of its weak
script, lack of punch to its comedy, and the plot was too incredible to believe
or become absorbed in. But if you're a fan of the 75-year-old sexy actor, Paul
Newman, it must be good to see that he still looks good, can turn on the charm,
and can still act with the best of them. 
Henry Manning (Newman) is a bank robber felon who had a stroke in prison and
because they have no beds available arrives in a private-convalescent home in a
comatose state while strapped to a wheelchair. His caring nurse, in this rural
Oregon town, Carol (Fiorentino), is awed by his presence, but thinks he's faking
the stroke. She does a lap dance on him, which fails to arouse him; but this
doesn't stop a further attempt to uncover if he's faking the illness. After
getting permission to take Henry on a picnic with her unambitious husband Wayne
(Dermot), she throws him from the wheelchair into the water. Happy to learn that
the bank robber couldn't pull the wool over her eyes, the former high school
prom queen who married the prom king, decides that Henry, who faked his illness
so he could escape, will rob a bank with her and she could thereby get enough
bread to escape from this humdrum town. Wayne is jealous of Newman, who could
still attract a beautiful woman, but he reluctantly goes along with his wife's
idea to be a bank robber at the risk of losing her if he doesn't. 
Newman plans to rob an armored car at the start of its route. The guards are not
as alert then because there's no money collected, yet. This gives Newman an
excuse to do some acting, as he goes to different business establishments to
collect the money. 
The story itself is disappointing, but this is the kind of sexy and amoral role
that Fiorentino is very good at. She plays with her dense husband and with the
fascination she has for Newman, and the film has some light moments to recommend
it. It's somewhat pleasing and that could be enough to satisfy a certain type of
audience. But if you really want my opinion, I wouldn't go two steps out of my
way to see this one.

Director David Fincher gave the general public the idea of single-serving
friends in `Fight Club.'  Director Marek Kanievska (captain of the helms of
such cinematic Titantics as Less than Zero) and Canada 3000 introduced to me
the concept of the single serving movie.
Like the single serving friend, the single serving movie is largely
uninteresting, cheap, seemingly less intelligent than you are, and served to
you with a shrink wrapped set of headphones for five Canadian Dollars for
three showings.  On my flight from London to Toronto, I was granted the joy
of a triple whamme: Mission to Mars, Mickey Blue Eyes, and Where the Money
is three films that are highly mediocre at best.
Where the Money is centers around Carol (Linda Fiorentino), a bored
housewife who works at a nursing home, has an on-the-rocks marriage with her
husband Wayne (Dermont Mulroney), and cares for ex-bank robber
extraordinaire Henry (Paul Newman).  Carol wants one more thrill, Wayne's
not getting her rocks off, so she figures she'll try Henry's screws (or
screwing Henry) and maybe even rob an armored car route in the meantime of a
couple of million dollars who knows?
But, if the hackneyed and unoriginal names of the triad running the show are
any indication of the collective imagination of Where the Money Is (and they
are), you know you're not going to get an interesting caper of double
crosses rife with sexual tension a la The Wachowski's Bound.  You're going
to get a mass-marketable caper with a few jokes thrown in and the obligatory
Last Seduction rip off that comes with any time Linda Fiorentino steps onto
the screen.
Whether this is simply the result of a vapid imagination on the part of
screenwriters E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien, and Carroll Cartwright or part of
corporate decisions related to the typecasting of Fiorentino as the perky,
evil seductress you have to root for is both beyond my sphere of knowledge
and irrelevant to the issue: Where the Money Is just ends up too clear cut
for its own good.  The caper itself is predictable, not tense at all, and
this is the absolute high point of the movie.  This, of course, makes Where
the Money Is just like any other rental on the shelves, with all of the
appeal.
Fiorentino, Newman, and Mulroney are all capable performers handed terrible
dialogue to work with (Fiorentino actually says `I won't tell the police,
but I may make you play bingo.') and asked to make it sound musical, and
only their incredible prowess as thespians allows them to pull off a half
decent performance with material that chimps could have typed.  If only the
writers had tried to be original, or at least pick a good film like Bound to
carbon copy, then they would have been much better off.  As it is, Where the
Money is ends up being just another movie I can't recommend.

_Where_the_Money_Is_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Well into his 70s, Paul Newman still has a vim and vigor that burns
incandescently on the silver screen.  But as he ages gracefully, the
projects he chooses to make are less so.  Latest case in point:
_Where_the_Money_Is_, a mechanical caper comedy that is more of a tedious
watch than the breezy lark it aims to be.
Newman is well matched with co-star Linda Fiorentino, who plays Carol,
who unhappily works at the nursing home Newman's Henry is staying at. 
Henry, a convicted thief, is transferred to the home after suffering a
stroke--or, rather, faking one, a fact that only Carol is quick to pick
up on.  Instead of turning Henry in and thwarting his escape plans, Carol
decides to make a deal with him: she will help him make a getaway if he
will help her with one big heist.  Henry agrees take part in Carol's big
plan, as does her husband Wayne (Dermot Mulroney, in a thankless role),
who has reservations about the whole scheme.
The meat of _Money_ is simple enough, but it takes forever to cut to it.
 The film runs a compact 89 minutes, but about 60 of those minutes are
buildup filler featuring a mass of misfired jokes.  Some racy gags
involving Carol's use of her sexuality to awaken Henry from his "stroke"
are overdone, and the dialogue the two eventually exchange is not as
witty as it would like to be.  Only Newman's magnetism, Fiorentino's
sultry spunk, and the undeniable chemistry between them keeps this
section watchable.
Theoretically, when time comes for Henry, Carol, and Wayne to stage
their heist, _Where_the_Money_Is_ should really kick into gear.  While
this section is certainly more interesting than anything that preceded
it, there's nothing terribly exciting about it.  In fact, the scheme
itself is fairly by-the-numbers, without any imaginatively quirky twists
that one would expect from such a light comedy.  Director Marek Kanievska
plays the big robbery straight in every possible way, meaning not just
taking it fairly seriously but also adding nothing beyond what's on the
page, such as suspense or tension.
Maybe Newman's relaxation in front of the camera was just so infectious
that everyone behind the camera on _Where_the_Money_Is_ felt the urge to
work in a lower gear.  But they mistook his effortless ease for laziness,
for while one sees the fire behind Newman's cool, one can see nothing
behind this film's glacial slickness.

IN SHORT: Start-up sparks fizzle, but not a dud.
Before we start, this is the kind of review Cranky hates to write
because a flick with more positives is going to get what appears to be a
negative rating, if you are a new reader and don't understand how we
work. If that's you Click here now.
So . . . what's wrong with this picture? Nothing, actually. It's a
perfectly average story with an OK script and direction. It is pleasing,
intelligent, humorous and there's good chemistry between stars Linda
Fiorentino and Paul Newman. Once the sparks get pulled out of the story
mix, everything settles way down. The sense of elation that we expect
from an underdog getting away with the big score "caper" flick just
isn't here.
We start on a high school Prom night, for soon to be marrieds Carol Ann
and Wayne McKay (Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney), the highpoint of
their lives, before and after. Fifteen or so years later, Carol is a
rehab therapist in a nursing home and Wayne works the night shift at an
unspecified job. The fire is almost gone from their marriage, unless a
certain song by The Cars reminds them of what was probably the biggest
thrill of their lives.
Into the home, whose population seems to be 99 per cent elderly ladies,
comes Henry Manning (Paul Newman). Manning, a notrious bank robber,
suffered such a severe stroke in prison that he has been temporarily
transferred out. Slumped in his wheel chair, with only the twitch of his
left hand to indicate that anything at all is functioning within his
body, Manning is essentially dead to the world. Except that Carol starts
to notice things, coincidences if you will, that indicate to her that
Manning isn't the vegetable that he appears to be. She makes it her duty
to try to get a rise out of the man. Literally. (OK, guys. Linda
Fiorentino in a nurse's uniform. Go to town. The flick does...) Until
the lady manages to crack the man's shell, this flick is a very sexy and
very funny good time. And Newman never speaks a word.
Carol's ultimate goal is to put the thrill back in her and Wayne's life.
She's determined to get Manning to teach her how to rob the local bank,
and get away with it. Oh, and Wayne, too. When the hubbie senses that
something naughty may be going on between his wife and the con, he lays
down the law, and Manning says "No problem." From that point on, the
sexual sparks fizzle and we're left with an average caper flick.
Why didn't Manning flee the home? It's covered in the script. How did he
pull off the stroke? It's covered in the script. How does the caper come
about and is it logical that it could succeed? It's covered in the
script. Is there an inevitable twist that puts the plans in jeopardy?
It's covered in the script, a couple of times to keep things
interesting. Where's the elation you're supposed to feel when the
inevitable occurs? Heck if I know. The script has everything it's
supposed to. The direction gets from point A to point B, but all the
pizazz goes out of the story early on. It's up to the director to keep
that chemistry sparking; in this case not letting the leads have any
kind of flirtatious back and forth is deadly.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Where the Money Is, he would have
paid...
Pay per view level. My parents, retired and eligible for dirt cheap
tickets, would love this kind of flick. To those of us for whom Paul
Newman is still a big star name (like me), if there's nothing else out
there of interest you might risk first run ticket prices, if they're not
too much above what your cable system will charge down the line.

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/997038ef028e021d882568b20015019d?OpenDocument
At more than one point in his career, Paul Newman has been the ultimate
con man.  THE STING, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, COOL HAND LUKE,
THE HUSTLER, and THE COLOR OF MONEY all epitomized this master of smooth
talk and wily ways.  But the successes of all of his past films and all
of their cons have one common denominator: a memorable and talented
supporting cast.  In THE HUSTLER, Jackie Gleason played Minnesota Fats,
who proved to be a worthy nemesis by outsmarting the cocky and more
talented Newman.  Tom Cruise, in THE COLOR OF MONEY, was like an
apprentice learning from the master sorcerer, as Newman molded Cruise
into an effigy of his old self.  While Newman always emerged the star,
he would continually share the spotlight, so that none of those movies
became one-dimensional.
 Newman's latest film, WHERE THE MONEY IS, directed by Marek Kanievska
(LESS THAN ZERO), unfortunately lacks the supporting cast for Newman to
thrive as the luminary "hustler."  In the film, Newman plays Henry
Manning, a former bank robber who plans to break out of prison by faking
a stroke.  When he is transferred to a minimum-security nursing home, he
thinks he's home free.  However, the woman assigned to take care of him,
Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino - MEN IN BLACK) suspects that he's a
fake and attempts to lure him out of his trance so he will help her in a
burglary with her and her husband Wayne (Dermot Mulroney - COPYCAT, MY
BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING).  She goes to some outrageous lengths to keep him
from playing possum, but when she finally awakes the bank robbing
legend, she faces a challenge that could change her life.
Nothing against Linda Fiorentino, who does a fine job in this movie, but
she has no extraordinary talents that allow her to become a stand-out
criminal worthy of Newman's tutelage.  Also, her husband Wayne proves to
be a clumsy ox despite his prowess on the football field and the "cool
head" that his wife constantly brags about.  As Newman states in one of
his first lines, "It's amateur hour," and unfortunately this is the sad
truth for this movie.
Though the far-fetched plot and lack of support diminish Newman's
shining star, the movie isn't a complete failure.  It offers some good
laughs and a few vintage Newman moments, like his dance with Fiorentino,
where he manages to change her life in one song and a two-step.

WHERE THE MONEY IS [Kanievska] -- Clever is the only word to describe
the sheer veracity contained in watching Fiorentino, Newman, and, to a
lesser extent, Dermot Mulroney, exchanging a silent -- or verbal, for
that matter -- battle over *everything that Kanievska has set forth. I
mean, it's just so c-o-o-l! I'm sure many of you cynics, who, y'know,
don't know how to enjoy a movie, would say that the characters are
lacking and the plot is a bit ludicrous, which I retort, to all you
naysayers: And? Fiorentino's motivation may be simplistic, and the
ending may seem too neat and tidy (as much as that can be under the
circumstances of a bank heist), but that's how classic movies are made,
right? I mean, when Paul Newman -- now three-quarters of a century old
-- and Linda Fiorentino flirt with the romantic subtext, we really
believe it, and why shouldn't we? It's a movie folks, and Newman is one
darn fine actor. My one criticism: If one is ever to question the power
of music, correct your inverted perception by attending this one: the
score by one Mark Isham (who's work has been so-so for the last five
years) is so horrendous and ultimately distracting -- like something
made for the latest movie-of-the-week, if they still had those -- that
it bumped this one down a notch. B+

     At the age of 75, Paul Newman is still one of the sneakiest, most
thoroughly professional actors in films. His manner is so relaxed and his
charisma so undeniable that it's easy to forget how good he is at what he
does; if Newman has ever mailed in a performance, I'd like to know what it
was. I find it hard not to get enthused about a caper film like WHERE THE
MONEY IS when I know that Newman is in the lead role. After all, no actor
has ever done a better job than Newman of bringing life and charm to
criminals (BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID, COOL HAND LUKE), broken-down
has-beens (SLAP SHOT, THE VERDICT) and slick hustlers (THE STING, THE
COLOR OF MONEY). World-weary intelligence fits him like Spandex.
     It's my sad duty to report that there's more weary than world-weary
to WHERE THE MONEY IS, though you can hardly blame Newman for its 
failings. He plays Henry Manning, a veteran bank robber who finds himself
transferred from jail to a nursing home after he suffers a severe stroke. 
Assigned to his care is Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino), a nurse and
former prom queen whose life and marriage to former prom king Wayne
(Dermot Mulroney) never turned out like she hoped. Then Carol begins to
suspect that Henry has faked his stroke symptoms to get out of prison, and
eventually she forces Henry to show his true colors. Though Henry thinks
at first that Carol plans to turn him in or blackmail him, she actually
has other plans in mind -- specifically, she hopes Henry will teach her
the tricks of the thieving trade.
     WHERE THE MONEY IS gets off to a kicky start with a flashback
prologue of Carol and Wayne racing recklessly away from their prom, set to
The Cars' infectious 1983 hit "You Might Think." The script (co-scripted
by E. Max Frye from his original story) sets up Carol as a live wire
shorted out by routine, and Fiorentino does a more than capable job of
giving her a spark (she's one of the few actresses who approaches Newman
in the world-weary intelligence department). As the film peeks into
Carol's marriage to Wayne, it begins to set up a character study of a
woman driven to ridiculous lengths by the desire to add some excitement to
her mundane life.
     And it's a very, very stupid idea. WHERE THE MONEY IS, it should be
reiterated, has a caper at its core -- an armored car heist executed by
Henry, Carol and Wayne. It's an effective enough centerpiece, but it has
virtually nothing to do with the rest of the movie. In fact, while the
heist sequence is far from breathtaking in its execution -- director Marek
Kanievska appears to have a philosophical objection to making the film
interesting to watch on a minute-to-minute basis -- it only makes the
central issue of Carol's mid-life crisis seem utterly inconsequential. 
There's nothing wrong with adding some character to a plot-driven caper
structure, but that's not what WHERE THE MONEY IS does. It actually adds
more plot -- in the form of Wayne's jealous streak, Carol's attempts to
help free Henry, etc. The film pretends it's character-based just long
enough to distract from the main story, then ties up everything so quickly
you wonder if there were people involved at all.
     The horrible consequence of this approach is that Newman is almost
completely wasted. It's not so much that his character spends the first
twenty minutes with his face frozen into a rictus, but that no one seems
to know what to do with him once Henry does come to life. He still snaps
off his dialogue with a seen-it-all rasp, and he lets those famous blue
eyes dart and speak when no other part of his body is capable. WHERE THE
MONEY IS builds a charge of potential energy from his mere presence. It
rarely, however, finds an effective way to release that energy. Here he
talks his way out of an encounter with a pair of cops; there he pulls a
fast one on a slimy orderly. For the rest of the film he just waits for a
reason to be there. It's hard to figure what he saw in the script, since
WHERE THE MONEY IS theoretically is more about Carol than it is about
Henry. Newman has earned better in his 50 year career than being left to
support an ineffectual caper, just because that's where the money is.
