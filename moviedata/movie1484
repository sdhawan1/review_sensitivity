Written by: Stuart Blumberg 
Directed by: Edward Norton 
Running Time: 128 minutes 
Barring the obvious comparisons to any jokes, priest Brian (Edward
Norton, making his directorial debut), and rabbi Jacob (Ben Stiller),
both fall for their grade school chum Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) when
she blows into town on a business trip.  Brian believes Anna has fallen
in love with him over the course of the few weeks she's been in town
when in truth, she has actually started seeing Jacob.  Jacob is happy
with their noncommittal relationship at first, but when Anna starts to
get serious, he begins to have doubts about what his parishioners and
mother will think about his relationship with a non-Jewish girl.  Can
Brian forgive Jacob for lying to him about the relationship he has been
in?  Can Anna forgive Jacob for placing his career above their
relationship?  Will Jacob's congregation and mother understand and
accept that he's in love with a gentile? 
Every once and a while, a film somehow manages to capture my frame of
mind perfectly and for the entire running length of said film, I am
completely in tune with the message being conveyed.  Keeping the Faith
was just such a movie (Instinct is another good example of one). 
Although I'm not personally embroiled in a struggle over a girl with a
friend of mine, I was somehow able to relate to all of these characters'
struggles in my own personal way.  I won't bore anyone with the details
but suffice to say, the theme of choice is a major one in the film and I
have been faced with several MAJOR life altering choices of my own in
the last two months. 
The performances are remarkably solid in this film.  Edward Norton has
quickly become one of my favorite actors (and certainly one of the best
of the newer crop) and here he certainly doesn't disappoint, even
getting to show off a little bit of his slapstick ability.  The scene
where Anna and Jacob's relationship is revealed to Norton's character is
utterly amazing, and really shows off his ability as an actor.  Ben
Stiller is always reliable as a comedic actor and here it is no
different, but we also get a chance to see his rare dramatic side (which
oddly still contains a hint of comedy).  The always gorgeous Jenna
Elfman gets a chance to shine as well, with a deftly balanced role as
the hard edged business woman that still remembers her childhood hanging
out with the guys and longs to rekindle that spirit again.  All three
actors share such a camaraderie and natural chemistry in this film that
it almost seems as if they did spend their childhoods together. 
The supporting cast turns in pretty decent performances as well.  Eli
Wallach plays the understanding mentor to Stiller's rabbi Jacob
character, Lisa Edelstien plays the rough and tumble date that Jacob has
been set up on (most of the scenes of which are shown in the trailer,
but all of which occur fairly early on in the film), Anne Bancroft is
perfect as Jacob's understanding but imperfect mother, and Ron Rifkin
(the heavy in films like The Negotiator and, to a lesser extent, Boiler
Room) plays the head of a board of rabbis that will either make or break
Jacob's career in the synagogue.  Perhaps the biggest surprise comes
from the appearance of director Milos Forman (who directed Norton in The
People vs. Larry Flynt) as a wise priest who teaches Brian to decide
what's best for himself and his faith.  
Despite the romantic comedy clichés Keeping the Faith seems trapped in,
the screenplay remains fairly intelligent.  None of the emotions seem
forced, and the comedy certainly doesn't (despite a pretty awful joke
towards the end of the film involving a woman's comment about
confessions "these days").  Although it may date the film in the long
run, it is also very topical.  There are several in-jokes about recent
films (released within the last five years) and countless other modern
pop culture references scattered throughout.  
I found Keeping the Faith to be an extremely good film.  Who knows,
depending on the way things turn out in the next few years I may look
back on this movie and feel totally different about it.  For now though,
I find it to be incredibly charming and intelligent, and for once I
actually agree with everyone who says it would make a good date film.

A REVIEW OF KEEPING THE FAITH, BY JOHN CARROLL (all reviews seen at
http://moviepage.hypermart.net/)

Keeping the Faith, starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman,
Anne Bancroft, Milos Forman, Ron Rifkin, Holland Taylor, Eli Wallach, Kryss
Anderson, Dagmara Dominczyk, Ken Leung, Rena Sofer and Brian Anthony Wilson. 
Directed by Edward Norton.  Written by Stuart Blumberg.  2000.
Reviewed by John Carroll.
   The first quarter of any year is bound to be horrendous, film-wise that is. 
January and February drag on into March with nothing but trash after trash
flowing into theatres.  Studios cross their fingers that a certain star or ad
campaign will catch the majority of filmgoers for a fateful weekend to secure
the box-office crown.  Up until Erin Brockovich's March 18 debut, the
theatres were putrid.  But, we finally are starting to see a turn towards the
better, with the summer build-up heading towards full tilt.  On April 14th, a
truly splendid comedy graces its way into theatres.  Keeping the Faith
is similar to 1998's You've Got Mail, but Edward Norton, who directs and
stars, takes Stuart Blumberg's script and produces a romantic comedy that
provides just as many off-beat laughs as it does gushiness.
   Keeping the Faith has a very volatile blend of drama and comedy, such
that it once and awhile detracts from the humorous experience.  The main
premise of Keeping the Faith focuses on the relationship between Father
Brian Finn (Norton), Rabbi Jake Schram (Ben Stiller) and Anna Reilly (Jenna
Elfman).  The trio were best friends during grade school, but were fractured
when Reilly moved away after eighth grade.  Over 15 years later, Anna is
returning to New York for business and the trio is reunited once again. 
Keeping the Faith goes all over the place, but manages to get sensible
laughs no matter where it travels.  Whether it be the differences between
faiths, the hypocrisy of outer-faith relationships or Edward Norton's dead on
Raymond Babbitt (Rain Man) impression, Keeping the Faith gets its
laughs cleanly and whole-heartedly.
   Keeping the Faith opens with Father Brian stumbling down the street,
drunk, and goes to a bar.  Right from the get-go, Norton establishes that this
is a comedy.  Five minutes into the film, he makes fun of the obvious "priest,
rabbi and a women" jokes that never seem to go out of style.  From this point
on, Norton never ventures into serious territory over religion or
relationships, and when he manages to tread the line, he or Ben Stiller manage
to show us the punchline in it all.
   The plot evolves from the union of the trio to the love that the priest and
rabbi share for Anna.  Schram, a rabbi constantly fixed up by his congregation,
is looking for spontaneous love, not a relationship that will just make him
look better to his peers.  Finn, a priest looking to modernize his faith,
finally finds something worth loving; a new faith that he is fully interested
in pursuing.  Through both perspectives, Norton explores what true faith really
is.  And through it all, he maintains a high level of comedy, whether it be the
perfect timing of Ben Stiller, or the off-beat comedy of minor characters like
Don (Ken Leung; Rush Hour) or T-Bone (Brian Anthony Wilson; Snake
Eyes).
The cast is harmonious.  Norton once again displays his versatility, going
from the daring Fight Club to the darling Keeping the Faith.  The
chemistry between himself and Ben Stiller is what keeps Keeping the
Faith on its toes.  Norton is not a veteran comedic actor, but being paired
with uber-comic Stiller let him learn the ropes rather quickly.  Jenna Elfman,
coming off her stellar performance in EDtv (hint: sarcasm), manages to
provide most of the romance in the film, and for the most part, lets Stiller
and Norton get the laughs.  The supporting cast is perfect, with small parts
that lend hardy laughs at key moments.  Seeing Finn pry at Schram in the audio
store got rather tedious, and at this rather dull moment, Don (Leung) makes his
first appearance, chiming away on the karaoke machine.  Keeping the
Faith stays fresh because it throws in comedy at the perfect points
throughout, while still managing to balance out the romance and faith that
ultimately end the film.  The one strong supporting member of the cast with
quite a few scenes is Anne Bancroft (The Graduate).  She lends the
veteran scars to Keeping the Faith and her neurotic role as the rabbi's
mother is delightful, extracting an "Oi Vei" from the audience at the end.
   For all of this praise, Keeping the Faith does have a few minor
detriments.  Clocking in at over 2 hours, Keeping the Faith drags on
while heading into the homestretch.  Romantic comedies are not keen for twist
endings, so watching the montages of each character does get a little tedious. 
Of course, this is the part where faith and love take over for comedy.  This
span of fifteen minutes is the one part where Blumberg forgets about the comedy
that had ruled the film.  This could have been cut down, but despite it,
Keeping the Faith still comes up on top with its charm intact.
   You've Got Mail was delightful, but Keeping the Faith steps
out of the usual path of romantic comedies by providing some all-around humor. 
It may be a great date movie, but I would highly encourage anyone to see
Keeping the Faith that is looking for some great laughs.  With
characters having names like Father, Rabbi and T-Bone, Keeping the Faith
may seem like another cheap piece of comedy, but it is anything but.  Norton
manages to keep his film distinct from any others, and in doing so, reminds the
viewer to KEEP THE FAITH in some diamonds in the rough for the first
quarter of the film year.
Final Verdict: B+

Starring-Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman,
Eli Wallach, Anne Bancroft, Milos Forman and Ron Rifkin
Director-Edward Norton
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Touchstone Pictures - 04/00
You've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi, but never
with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
`Keeping the Faith'. It's a fluffy comedy, thoroughly glazed with a
sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer, regarding two moral topics
-- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to
collide head-on.
As youngsters, Brian Finn, Jacob Schramm and Anna Reilly were an
inseparable trio. While their friendship progressed, Anna always had the
compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so
neither would feel excluded. But tragedy soon struck, as Anna was forced
to move away. Now adults, Brian (Edward Norton) and Jacob (Ben Stiller)
hold similar but contrastive jobs. The likable and kind-hearted Father
Brian is a Catholic Priest, while the spry and outgoing Jacob acts as a
Jewish Rabbi. On the basketball court, they refer to themselves as `The
God Squad'. In the relationship field, Brian abides by his Catholic
principle of celibacy, but Jacob has reached the point where finding a
Jewish bride is practically mandatory. Everything changes when Anna
(Jenna Elfman) returns to New York to visit her childhood chums. Now a
workaholic, she devotes endless hours per week to her business, but does
find spare time to reminisce with Brian and Jacob - both ecstatic about
seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again. With these oddball
ingredients tossed into one cocktail, there's bound to be some awkward
romance between our three central characters. Predicting the outcome is
not entirely difficult, but `Keeping the Faith' is open, entertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from Point A to Point B.
Edward Norton has emerged as one of the finest, most flexibly versatile
actors in Hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded
debut in the 1996 thriller `Primal Fear'. After shockingly bitter roles
in `American History X' and, most recently, David Fincher's vicious
`Fight Club', a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar
choice. Not in the least. Norton slips into the director's chair for the
first time with `Keeping the Faith', and here his incisive, resourceful
approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive
screenplay by Stuart Blumberg. Weighing every aspect, it is unanimously
an impressive directorial debut. In addition, Norton pushes all the
right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart Brian, generating a
thoroughly likable screen presence. Stiller (the zipper guy from
`There's Something About Mary') is firm and funny, boasting a
fully-ripened comic maturity. Elfman's perky repetition can grow
tiresome (such is occasionally the case on TV's `Dharma and Greg'), but
she seems perfectly rambunctious here. The remaining cast members offer
fine support, from Anne Bancroft as Jacob's animated Jewish mom to Milos
Forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice.
`Keeping the Faith' is the perfect date flick... though perfection is
not a word to associate with the film in general. There is turbulence
during the process of lift-off, as numerous failed attempts at
establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead. Once the
film does settle in, it is often funny and always cheerful. Stiller,
Norton and Elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities.
We enjoy their interaction, understand their various dilemmas and feel
humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true. This is excluding
the ending, which is acceptable and all, but seems to lack the charm and
spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements. Nonetheless, a
narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face,
nor anyone else's in the audience. `Keeping the Faith' is a highly
enjoyable romantic comedy, although one that is more observant while
surveying the questions of love rather than religion. Aww, what the
hell. The quality is not quite heaven-sent, but this little charmer
could revive our `Faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre.

Did you hear the one about the priest, the rabbi and the Scientologist?
It's not a joke, but rather Keeping the Faith, the directorial debut of
Hollywood wunderkind Ed Norton, who co-produced the film with his buddy
(and the film's screenwriter) Stuart Blumberg.  Norton casts himself as
the priest, Ben Stiller as the rabbi and Jenna Elfman  a Scientologist
in real life  plays the woman that comes between the two pious pals.
Like Norton's Fight Club, the film has the disheveled star telling most
of the film through flashback, this time as his character Father Brian
Finn.  In the sixth grade, Brian and his best friend Jacob Schram
(Stiller, Black & White) form an inseparable, platonic bond with fellow
student Anna Reilly (Elfman, Dharma & Greg).  The three are joined at
the hip for two years, until Anna's father gets a job transfer.  Brian
and Jacob remain close, but they never see Anna again.
As adults, Brian and Jacob pursue their respective spiritual careers,
incorporating honest, comedic routines to their sermons, which soon are
delivered to packed rooms as the word spreads through their neighborhood
that faith is hip again.  Nicknamed `The God Squad,' the priest and
rabbi even plan to open a multi-faith senior citizen karaoke/dance club
to which their flocks can flock.  Everything is going well, until Anna
calls and announces that she's coming to New York for an extended
business trip.
Of course, when the two men pick Anna up at the airport, they find that
she's a stone-cold fox. Despite previously having only a friendly,
non-physical relationship with Anna, you know it won't be long before
Brian and Jacob are beating their chests and tugging at her like two
lions tearing apart a gazelle.  Yup  there's nothing like vagina to
ruin a good friendship.  And unless you're talking about a Gregg Araki
film, there is really only two ways the film can end  Anna leaves New
York alone and Brian and Jacob stay friends, or Anna stays in New York
and all three remain friends.
Faith has a very funny trailer, which is always a concern these days
since it seems that a film's best moments are usually shown in its
preview.  That's not the case here, as Faith blows through most of the
trailer's highlights in the first five minutes.  There are some great
religious gags in the film, usually revolving around Judaism (Jacob
plays with `Heroes of the Torah' playing cards and is dogged by
persistent Jewish mothers that fix him up on dates that he can't
refuse), while Norton uses the film to show off his dead-on impressions
of Rain Man and Latka Gravas.  The usually annoying Elfman is downright
charming as the high-powered something-or-other businesswoman.
Two-time Oscar nominee Norton, who has already logged five amazing
performances in just six major releases, lets the film get away from him
about two-thirds of the way through, where things begin to drag.  It's
really too bad, because Faith would be a great film if about twenty
minutes were hacked out of it.  His style is pretty unobtrusive (save a
few odd shots during a sex scene), which may have something to do with
the actor working with heavy-hitting directors like Milos Forman (The
People vs. Larry Flynt), David Fincher (The Fight Club) and Woody Allen
(Everyone Says I Love You), the latter of whom was an obvious influence
on Norton.  Faith contains plenty of shots of its characters yelling at
each other on the sidewalks of New York.
Norton even casts Forman in Faith.  Has the student become the master?
Not quite, but it's certainly a promising debut.
2:11 - PG-13 for adult language, adult situations and mild sexual

KEEPING THE FAITH [Norton] -- Nothing more than passable fluff, really,
which I guess ain't bad, but I do prefer characters that I can truly
sympathize-slash-empathize with and I suppose Norton had it toughest:
the majority of the movie going public isn't exactly made up of Catholic
priests. Thankfully, first-time director/actors tend to be especially
critical of their performances; thus, his character, who bothered me
quite a bit until reel three, is absent from the majority of the
romantic proceedings. The subject-matter doesn't lend itself to any
particular visual style (other than the typical prose of Nora Ephron,
who is thanked in the end credits), so we, as an audience, are left
wondering if Nortion can really direct. But then, there's that whole
other mystery entirely: Who ever would've envisioned Edward Norton as
director of a romantic-comedy? By the way, Ben Stiller is a genius. C+

Starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman. Directed by Edward
Norton. Rated PG-13.
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Keeping the Faith has
one of the best romantic comedy premises in recent years. The idea is
just brimming with potential and at the hands of two great actors there
shouldn't have been any problems following through on it.
Unfortunately, just when the movie needs insight and originality, the
script eagerly turns to sentimental conventions that have long worn out
their welcome in movies past. This is a movie with a fantastic set-up
but absolutely no payoff.
Edward Norton directs himself and Ben Stiller as two best friends whose
lives have led them in the same direction but on different paths. Brian
Finn (Norton) and Jacob Schram (Stiller) have known each other since
grade school. Now, in their late 20's, they're still pals except that
Jacob has become a Rabbi and Brian a Catholic priest. They've spent the
last few years trying to bring their religions back into pop culture.
Since leather jackets didn't work, they're now trying to form a karaoke
club.
Their lives are routine until Brian receives word that Anna Riley, a
girl they adored as children, is coming back to New York to visit them.
They go to the airport to greet her, complete with a sign that
proclaims "Anna Banana" to bring back a childhood joke. The reunion is
jubilant, as the three have no problem getting back to the kind of
banter that permeated their relationship when they were kids.
But things don't remain that simple for long. Brian, bound by his vow
of chastity and having been bothered little by temptation so far,
begins to fantasize about Anna and struggle with his religion.
Meanwhile, Anna and Jacob begin a more intimate relationship, but
although Jacob is not sworn to celibacy, his parents, his congregation
and his community all expect him to marry a nice Jewish girl and a
relationship with Anna is unlikely to get him the promotion to Head
Rabbi he so desperately wants.
There's some good stuff here. Stiller and Norton are both wonderful
actors with the ability to breathe life into the most mundane dialogue.
Jenna Elfman, too, is a great comic talent -- heretofore woefully
underused (and no, EdTV doesn't count) and now surprisingly promising.
The script, by first-timer Stuart Blumberg, has intermittent laughs and
a few slight insights into interfaith relationships. But thanks to (in
all probability) some clueless studio execs, all of that adds up to
exactly zilch.
The ending is a gigantic cop-out. What began as a seriously funny
comedy about the intermingling of love and faith ends as stupidly sappy
chunk of drivel, reverting back to that old Hollywood mentality that if
the protagonists of a love story start getting really lucky, things all
of a sudden start going their way, all the characters turn out to have
good intentions and at the end everything is just perfect that the
audience will walk out grinning stupidly. That's only sometimes true.
You have to have the right set-up, establish the right mood for that
kind of ending. If it's out of the blue, you get something like Keeping
the Faith -- a movie so careful not to offend that it quickly polishes
any provocativeness off with an unnatural happy ending.
At a running time of well over two hours, there's plenty of time for
everything and Keeping the Faith tries mightily to please everyone. But
it failed to satisfy me. I'm not sure who is at fault, but the movie
wimps out.

Review by Lars Lindahl (larsattacks@mail.com)
"Keeping the Faith" (2000) **1/2 (out of four)
Starring Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman,
Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin, Hollan Taylor,
Lisa Edelstein, and Rena Sofer.
Edward Norton burst into the movies with his memorable
award winning performance as a young choir boy accused
of murder in Primal Fear. He proved he wasn't a one
hit wonder after impressive acting in American History
X and Fight Club. How does Norton fair in the romantic
comedy Keeping the Faith? Well he once again shows off
his acting skills except this time he shows them off a
little too much. In a very simple movie like this,
Norton just overacts and brings an excessive amount of
emotion into his character. By also directing the
film, it's as if he is trying to create his own Hamlet
and direct himself to an Oscar. Keeping the Faith is a
classic case of an actor bigger and better than the
picture. Co-star Ben Stiller, on the other hand, is
perfect for his role in the film. Much like his
character in There's Something About Mary, Stiller
plays a normal, likeable guy who has the worst luck
when it comes to the ladies. Maybe he isn't the best
actor on the planet and he most likely will be
typecast in these roles for the rest of his life, but
Stiller saves the movie. With as many one liners as
physical comedy, he just seems so comfortable in his
"everyman" role. No wonder he appears in more scenes
than the critically praised Norton, when it comes to
these types of movies, Stiller is the true
professional. 
Keeping the Faith follows two successful, popular,
iconoclastic best friends, one a priest (Norton) and
the other a rabbi (Stiller). The two have known each
other since the pre-teen years and their relationship
is seemingly unbreakable. However, their friendship
becomes somewhat turbulent when a female friend, Anna
(Jenna Elfman), who grew up with the two boys, comes
back to town and both guys find themselves attracted
to her. Not only do their sudden feelings for Anna
endanger their relationship, but also respect of
others in their professional fields. The priest
shouldn't even be thinking about Anna and because she
is not Jewish, the rabbi fears he will be widely
scrutinized. 
The mistake Keeping the Faith makes is that it spends
way too much time trying to teach the moral that you
must have faith in yourself and others equally in
order to make it in this world. In order to convey
this message, screenwriter Stuart Blumberg constantly
interrupts the quickly paced premise with long, boring
conversations that are neither romantic nor comedic.
In a romantic comedy, everything should be one or the
other. Don't get me wrong, I laughed several times
during the movie but even though the jokes were many,
they were very far between. The movie just dragged on
to a point where it was nearly unbearable, then
Stiller would appear in top form and pump some energy
into the story, then back to the dragging. A number of
segments during the movie contained little or no
development. 
The supporting cast is superb. Anne Bancroft, in
particular, is great as Stiller's mother who pressures
him into dating only Jewish women. Lisa Edelstein is
also noteworthy as one of the annoying girls who
Stiller is set up with. As "the date from hell,"
Edelstein's slapstick performance provides a number of
laugh-out-loud moments.
As for Jenna Elfman, she definitely brings some of
Dharma into her character. Honest, gregarious and
loquacious, Anna has everything the two men are
looking for. Elfman believably plays Anna and makes it
easy for the audience to understand why they instantly
go gaga for her. Like Stiller, she seems fit for roles
like these and dives right into her character with
complete control. 
Keeping the Faith won't be the funniest comedy of the
year but it is recommended for a few chuckles. And
Norton, I expect him to win an Oscar within five
years, maybe even two. Just not for movies like these.

DIRECTED BY: Edward Norton
WRITTEN BY: Stuart Blumberg
CAST: Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, Milos Forman, Eli Wallach, Anne Bancroft
MPAA: Rated PG-13 for some sexuality and language
Runtime: USA:128
"Faith is a hunch that there is something bigger" 
OK, listen to this. The priest and a rabbi go to a barHeard this
one? Well, here comes a story that you've never heard before. In his
directorial debut, actor/director/producer Edward Norton combines all
those "So, there's a Rabbi and a Priest" jokes together in a
magnificent spiritual comedy that is probably the first great comedy
of this century.
The film opens with the lights of New York on a warm summer
night. Father Brian, drunk and depressed is confiding to the
kind-hearted bartender. At this point we know that something has
happened and Brian tells the story of complications and events, both
amusing and sad. He begins his story many years ago - at the beginning
of the lifelong friendship between him, Jake Shram (Ben Stiller) and
Anna (Jenna Elfman). It was the best time of his life. But all good
things have to end and Anna moved to L.A. by the end of the eight
grade. Many years have passed and their friendship stayed the same,
though Brian has become a Catholic priest and Jake a rabbi. All around
Manhattan, these hipsters of the cloth are known, according to Finn's
narration, as the "God Squad," serving up "Old World gods with a New
Age spin." Everything's holy-rolling along until the unanticipated
return of Anna (Jenna Elfman), she is now a successful business
woman. The two clerics experience a feeling of deja-vu and gradually
fall in love with Anna all over again. But this time there are
complications. Brian is caught in the strict laws of the Catholic
Church, while Jake is pursued by the 'Kosher Nostra', where every
Jewish mother is introducing him to her every unmarried daughter. And
even Anna starts to doubt herself and her life. She is now a
high-powered, West Coast corporate executive -- a goal she has been
pursuing all her life. And when she finally got everything she
searched for, she is feeling a mysterious loss. Maybe she was pursuing
the wrong things? Maybe she missed the most important element in her
life? And so what is right? Religion or love? What is happiness? And
what's more important?
Even though this film lacks explosions, gunfights and even aliens, I
can't imagine anyone (except maybe 'Battlefield Earth'-fanatics) who
wouldn't like this film. There is no concrete story. The film is
completely driven by characters as they wrestle with their own demons
and questions of faith. The characters that inhabit Norton's film are
deeply human and therefore -- deeply flawed. They've all come to
certain conclusions about themselves, and each other, that this daffy
flick challenges in an amusing way. Most of the time the film feels
like a Woody Allen movie, without hysterics. It is the same comic
style and incredible New York locations. In fact the town itself is
one of the main characters in this film. Its multicultural environment
serves as a background, reflecting the main characters' emotions,
feelings and mood - shifting from lifeless gray to magically sparkling
lights. Norton doesn't manufacture comedy through jokes, nor is the
drama progressed by plot contrivances; this is a character-driven
story that evolves from the carefully drawn people that inhabit
it. And though it wrestles around with some heavy issues, romantic,
religious and ethnic themes, it is very successful. It's funny,
without constantly resorting to physical humor (like 'Whole Nine
Yards'). It's clever, without pushing and lecturing the audience (like
'28 Days'). It's light, without feeling unrealistic. It's romantic,
without floating in the sky (like 'The Wedding Singer'). In fact
Norton has created a magical blend - beautifully controlled and
elegantly presented. He approaches every aspect - each scene,
character and theme - with honesty and authenticity. You laugh because
it's candid, you catch a lump in your throat because it connects, and
you're moved because the emotions are undeniably real. Nothing ever
feels constructed, every single moment rings true, and you find
yourself identifying with everyone and nearly everything that occurs,
or at least with the emotions behind them. Norton keeps everything
pure, and the end result like life. It is a rare comedy, more
sophisticated than most, it is filled with surprising depth and
substantial charm, that you can rarely observe in motion pictures now
adays.
'Keeping the Faith' features great casting, which is likewise unusual
for romantic comedies. Norton looks great in a role that is completely
different from what he has done before. He has dyed his hair blond to
add Brian a more traditional "holy-look", and the way he portrays him
truly provoke emotions. Ben Stiller proves himself as a solid actor
and a performer capable of delivering complex roles. He finds a
balance between the comic and dramatic, while never becoming
unreal. As for Elfman, she is doing exactly what she is supposed to
do: look ravishing. Though there are times when her uncontrolled
energy transforms into a more complex emotions, but those times are
rare. There are some very interesting and amusing cameo performances,
provided by Anne Bankroft, Jakes strong mother, Eli Wallach as Jakes
religious supervisor and Milos Forman as Brian's mentor and friend.
The film is an incredible achievement. It projects warmth and emotions
that few comedies have before. At the same time, Norton manages to
canalize his story into something intelligent. There are many things
that this film chews on. It is about temptation and religious
conviction (a conversation between Anna and Brian, about sex, is a
splendid example of this). It is about the difference between faith
and religion, about what's important and about keeping the faith in
our modern, constantly changing world. But mostly it is a film about
real friendship and pure love. Jake's and Brian's devotion for each
other surpass everything - religion, politics and even religious
convictions. That is the movies heart and soul, and that's what makes
the film an incredibly pleasant experience. It' not masterpiece, don't
get me wrong. But not everyone can make 'Being John Malcovich' or
'American Beauty' as their first film. Even David Fincher ('Fight
Club') started with 'Alien 3', which though wasn't a great film,
somewhat introduced the audience to the new director. I think that
'Keeping the Faith' does exactly that, and I believe that 'we ain't
seen nothing yet'.
And though ending rather traditionally, 'Keeping the Faith' is really
a great film. I really felt that I've gained something after walking
out of the theatre. I felt..well, good. And I think that it was the
point. After leaving the theatre, I've promised myself that I will
stand first in line for Norton's hopeful comeback.

Edward Norton (FIGHT CLUB), one of the most gifted actors today, shows
that he is just as talented behind the camera as in front of it in his
directorial debut with KEEPING THE FAITH, a film in which he stars along
with Ben Stiller (THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) and Jenna Elfman (EDTV
and "Dharma & Greg").
Most actors, even some of the best ones, play essentially the same
character in every movie. Edward Norton is a true acting chameleon who
becomes completely different people in every part he plays.
In KEEPING THE FAITH, Norton plays Father Brian Finn, a sweet and
innocent Catholic priest with a pixyish grin. Ben Stiller plays Rabbi
Jacob Schram. The two of them are affectionately referred to as "The God
Squad." They are a lovable duo who pack their respective church and
synagogue with enthusiastic worshipers.
Jenna Elfman plays Anna Reilly, a 100-hour-per-week, workaholic
management consultant, who says God could have made the world in just 3
days if he had gotten her help. The 3 of them were best buddies until
Anna moved away from New York City in the eighth grade. The story
concerns their reuniting when she comes to The Big Apple to work on
temporary assignment. It is at a time in Jacob's life when the elders of
his congregation want him to find a good Jewish woman, something Anna
isn't, to marry.
In a cinematic era in which cynicism rules, KEEPING THE FAITH is that
rarest of movies that celebrate the importance and the joys of faith and
religion. And at a time in which dysfunctionalism is ever-present in
pictures, KEEPING THE FAITH shows the unbounded happiness of a good
romance.
Although the three of them resume their friendship as adult buddies,
their relationship quickly moves beyond that stage. And, when Jacob and
Anna fall in love, it gets complicated fast, especially since they
decide it would be better not to hurt Brian's feelings by telling him.
The script is quite funny, and there isn't a false moment in the movie.
Among the wonderful supporting cast is: Anne Bancroft as Jacob's Jewish
mother, Milos Forman as a wise older priest and Eli Wallach as an older
rabbi with big heart and an open mind. Set in New York City, the movie
is filmed beautifully, and the city's skyscrapers have never looked
lovelier.
The picture's only failing is that Norton makes the mistake of many
first-time directors and falls too much in love with his work, letting
some scenes meander when they should have been crisper.
The joy of KEEPING THE FAITH is contagious. This feel-good movie is a
real charmer with great romantic chemistry among the leads. It makes you
feel happy to be alive.
KEEPING THE FAITH runs 2:05. It is rated PG-13 for some sexuality and
language and would be fine for kids around 11 and up.
My son Jeffrey, almost 11, loved the movie, giving it a full ****. He
said that it was really funny and that his favorite part was when they
were all in the eighth grade.

Keeping the Faith combines all the old `So, there's a Rabbi and a Priest'
jokes, a beautiful romance and some righteously funny scenes to be the most
hilarious, insightful and fulfilling comedy in years. So who's to credit?
Could it be the hilarious Ben Stiller who comes out of his post There's
Something About Mary slump? Perhaps it is the equally funny and sexy Jenna
Elfman who is simply radiant on screen. Or maybe it is screenwriter Stuart
Blumberg who conceived the equally deep and amusing script. My vote goes to
Edward Norton, the actor that has been nominated for two Oscars in just nine
films, who not only breaks into the world of comedy here (although he did
have a small role in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You) but makes a
brilliant directorial debut as well.
Jake (Ben Stiller), Brian (Edward Norton) and Anna (Jenna Elfman) grew up
best friends in New York City. But after the eighth grade, Anna's father
accepted a job out west and Jake and Brian found themselves with only each
other to finish out their childhoods.
Time has passed. Jake and Brian are still the closest of friends although
their professions - Rabbi and Priest respectively - certainly wouldn't
indicate so. On the inner-city basketball courts they are known as `God
Squad' and in their respective houses of worship they are known as
reformers. Together they are trying to build a Catholic/Jewish nightclub
complete with karaoke. For Brian this isn't a conflict at all. But Jake's
superiors at the synagogue are troubled by his prayer/meditation sessions,
improvisation-filled sermons and, most recently, acquiring of a gospel choir
to rev up the congregation for Ein Keiloheinu (easily one of the funniest
scenes ever to grace the silver screen).
Then, one day, Brian gets a phone call. Soon the two religious leaders are
standing at a LaGuardia terminal with a sign reading `Anna Banana.' The girl
who once completed the trio is now a successful businesswoman who jokes
about her relationship with her cell phone. There are years of catching up
to be done in between confessions, Bar-Mitzvah lessons, conference calls and
group efforts to help Jake out with his pathetic love life.
To recap, there are three single friends that haven't been together in over
a decade. Two of them, a guy and a girl, are single and the third has taken
an oath prohibiting him from entering the dating game. You can figure out
the rest.
Norton, Stiller and Elfman all deliver great comedic performances. The film
opens with Norton playing an exaggerated drunk and this sets the tone for a
movie that will crack jokes about serious things. Elfman and Stiller both
take on, and succeed at, double-duties, not only trying to be funny but
romantic and, occasionally, ultra-serious as well.
You needn't look further than the 11 o'clock news to see religious wars
around the world. The Pope has apologized on behalf of Catholics for doing
nothing to stop the Holocaust, although you will be hard pressed to find him
saying it in such blunt terms. Recently a war was fought in Kosovo over
religious issues. Israel and Northern Ireland have grown accustomed to
religious warfare. These are sad things that force society to pause in
reflection. Some movies, like Life is Beautiful, Train of Life and Jacob the
Liar, have tried to make humor out of such tragedy. In this critic's
opinion, they have failed. Perhaps that is why Keeping the Faith is so
uproariously funny. Sure, the old circumcision, holy water and Jewish-mother
jokes make for humorous moments. But the overall comedy derives from the
unlikely situation of best friends not only affirming their faith in
different religions, but also leading those religions.
So, there's a Rabbi and a Priest (The punch line can be found at a theatre
near you).

"Keeping the Faith," actor Edward Norton's directorial debut, is an ambitious 
romantic comedy that succeeds on the charm of the three principle actors, as 
well as in the surprisingly smart writing by Stuart Blumberg, a rarity in 
today's films. It is also a little rough around the edges, and far too long, 
in desperate need of at least a fifteen minute trim, which could effortlessly 
be done without any impact at all in the story or its effectiveness. Things 
can't always be perfect, and "Keeping the Faith" is far from it, but in terms 
of its pure sweet-naturedness, it is one of the better adult romances to come 
around the pike in a while, and more satisfying than the recent, overly 
slight "Return to Me."
Taking off from the old "the-priest-and-the-rabbi-walk-into-a-bar" joke, ever 
since childhood, Manhattanites Brian (Edward Norton) and Jake (Ben Stiller) 
have been best friends. As they grew up, Brian decided to turn to Catholicism 
and became a priest, while Jake, who is Jewish, opted to become a rabbi. As 
young teenagers, they were close buddies with Anna Reilly, a pretty tomboy 
whom they were devastated to see move away when her father got a job offer on 
the other side of the U.S. Switch forward fifteen years, Brian and Jake are 
elated to receive a phone call from Anna (Jenna Elfman), now a high-powered, 
workaholic businesswoman, who is going to be dropping into NYC on business.
Once reunited, it is just like old times for the trio, who, while their lives 
have taken them in alternate directions, remain compatible and close. Anna is 
intrigued in Brian's required celibacy, while, at the same time, he is 
starting to grow the first truly romantic feelings he can remember. 
Meanwhile, Anna and Jake fall in love, but decide to keep it a secret from 
Brian, so as to not damage their camaraderie. There are other obstacles in 
the way of their feelings, too, including Anna's planned departure back to 
San Francisco once her business deal is finished, as well as Jake's religion 
requiring him to marry a Jewish girl--something that Anna is not.
Unlike most romances, the outcome of "Keeping the Faith" is not immediately 
foreseen because the problems stacked against the characters are more serious 
and important than the usual films in the genre, and the way all of the plot 
threads are handled is thoughtfully done. Issues involving religion and 
personal beliefs are focused upon and never second-guessed, keeping in hand 
an open mind throughout.
Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman, and Ben Stiller are a match made in Heaven, each 
one complimenting the other in both the chemistry and talent departments. 
Norton and Elfman, especially, have a radiance about them, and it is a fresh 
change of pace to see Norton in something lightweight and conventionally 
enjoyable. In her best role to date (superior to 1999's "Ed TV"), Elfman has 
what it takes to be a delightfully engaging film actress, with all of the 
qualities that has made Meg Ryan one of the queens of romantic comedies. 
Finally, Stiller, in a role oddly reminiscent of the one he played in 1998's 
"There's Something About Mary," rounds out the trio, and is very good as a 
man who can't help falling in love with Anna, but who fears rejection from 
everyone in his religious community, including his loving, but 
set-in-her-ways mother (Anne Bancroft).
Nevertheless, "Keeping the Faith" can't help but occasionally step wrong. The 
opening fifteen minutes rely too heavily on slapstick, and it is only when 
the adult Anna arrives in New York does the film settle down and firmly find 
its frothy, yet involving, tone. This leads to the second, and most major 
quiff, which is that, for a frothy romance, the picture doesn't know when to 
quit. Appearing as if director Norton and editor Malcolm Campbell didn't want 
to part with a second of footage, the pacing grows to meander by the start of 
the final one-third, just when any normal film of this kind should be 
reaching its conclusion.
What finally decides the fate of "Keeping the Faith" is its utter likability, 
and well as in the relationship that is built between Brian, Anna, and 
Jake--you believe that they are best friends who care for each other very 
deeply because the actors are so effervescent in their performances. Due to 
their magnetism and winning personalities, you find yourself rooting for all 
three of them to find some sort of middle ground where they can all manage to 
be happy, without hurting the others' feelings. "Keeping the Faith" may not 
be a great film, but it sure is an amiable enough way to spend a few hours.

Did you ever hear the one about the Priest and the Rabbi? You did, huh? Well
I promise you never heard it quite like this before. Okay I'm lying. That
may be what I want to say, but Edward Norton's "Keeping the Faith" is a good
natured, and at times very amusing little comedy which suffers from a lack
of originality. In fact, the biggest thing this movie has going for it are
the performances from the two lead actors. Don't get me wrong, "Keeping The
Faith" contains a few hilarious scenes, but a lot of the comedy feels like
its been done a thousand times over. For example, how many times have you
seen a person in a movie ask to be punched to show how tough they are, only
to collapse when actually hit; or seen a rabbi pass out the first time he
sees a circumcision? Strangely, the lack of originality doesn't ruin the
movie. Because the film is so pleasant natured the rehash of past comic bits
makes it feel comfortable and familiar.
Father Brian Finn (Edward Norton) and Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller) have
been friends since childhood, and they've both always known exactly what
they wanted to do with their lives. As children their best friend was Anna
Reilly (Jenna Elfman), who acted just like one of the boys. Now, twelve
years since they last saw Anna, she shows up as a career driven business
woman. Jacob, whose congregation has been trying to set him up with someone
for months, finds himself falling for Anna and she for him. The two decide
to get together, but without telling Brian for fear of alienating him. As
Anna falls further and further in love with Jacob, Jacob begins alienating
himself from Anna. He is afraid that his mother (Anne Bancroft) will disown
him, as she did his brother, for falling for a non-Jew.
I must admit, I was impressed by Edward Norton's abilities as a director,
this being his first time behind the camera. Not only is the man an
incredible actor, but he is now showing talent in other areas as well? Does
this strike anyone else as being a little unfair? Okay, I'm done being
Jealous. "Keeping the Faith" is a rare sort of movie these days. It's a
wholesome yet still highly amusing romantic comedy. When was the last time
you saw a movie made for people over the age of 10 which didn't contain some
act of extreme violence or blatant, explicit sexuality? Okay, my sermon is
now done with as well. I'm sorry about getting so preachy, but I just saw a
movie about a priest and a rabbi, what do you expect? Speaking of getting
preachy, I will say that "Keeping the Faith" has a tendency to do just that
from time to time; but not nearly as much as it could have considering the
film's topic.
Edward Norton may be a very gifted actor, but he obviously has no problem
taking a back seat to other actors. In fact, one of the problems I had with
this movie was that Norton's character is never given the amount of screen
time he deserved. Brian Finn could have been a very interesting character
but is never developed to that point. Ben Stiller's character, Rabbi Jacob,
on the other hand, is given ample screen time. Ben Stiller, previously seen
in the funny but overrated "There's Something About Mary", and the sadly
underrated "Mystery Men", is an actor who is capable of switching from
over-the-top physical comedy to serious acting in a split second. In this
movie he finally given the chance to shine as he has so deserved. The last
bit of casting, Jenna Elfman (Dharma and Greg), was a very poor decision in
my opinion. I have never found Jenna Elfman to be a particularly gifted
actress, and in this case she is asked to carry half the film with her
limited talents (she's also a good two or three inches taller than Stiller,
but that's beside the point).
Besides the somewhat dubious casting of Miss Elfman in a leading role here,
there is one more thing which makes "Keeping the Faith" a good film rather
than a great one. I've always said an important part of a movie is the
soundtrack, and that couldn't be more true in this case. Not only is there
very little music, but when the music is present, it is nearly always
inappropriate for the scene. Watch for Milos Forman (Director of "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest") in a supporting role as Norton's mentor. Anne
Bancroft ("The Graduate") is perfectly cast as Stiller's mother, but Ron
Rifkin ("Boiler Room") is unfortunately underused as an elder member of
Stiller's congregation. "Keeping the Faith" runs a little too long at 125
minutes. I recommend it to fans of Ben Stiller and romantic comedies in
general and give the film three and a half out of five stars.

KEEPING THE FAITH (director: Edward Norton; screenwriter: Stuart
Blumberg;  cinematographer: Anastas Michos; editor: Malcolm Campbell;
cast: Ben Stiller (Jake Schram), Edward Norton (Brian Kilkenny Finn),
Jenna Elfman (Anna Reilly), Anne Bancroft (Ruth Schram), Eli Wallach
(Rabbi Lewis), Ron Rifkin (Larry Friedman), Milos Forman (Father Havel),
Holland Taylor (Bonnie Rose), Ken Leung (Don), Brian George (bartender),
Ali (Lisa Edelstein), Rachel (Rena Sofer), 2000)
A contemporary, "light romantic comedy",  about three childhood friends
from junior high school in New York City's Upper West Side, Jake
(Stiller), Brian (Norton), and Anna (Jenna), who become very close,
doing everything together as a trio. But Anna, who was a very pivotal
part of their life because of her high energy and warmth and manner of
bringing them all together, moves to California and the two boys lose
contact with her, but they still remain best friends. Jake chooses not
to go into his father's lucrative business, instead becomes a rabbi,
while Brian becomes a priest. Anna Banana, as the boys affectionately
call her, returns to New York for her job, after being away for 15-
years. She has become a high-powered corporate executive, and when she
meets the boys at the airport, they see that she is still energetic and
has also grown into a most beautiful woman, attracting both of them. She
acts and looks a lot like Gwyneth Paltrow.
The film runs needlessly on for over two hours and takes this story into
many different areas concerning religious faith, personal goals,
cultures, comedy routines, and romance, with too many themes for it to
adequately cover. It manages to concentrate mostly about taboos in
religious matters, which creates many awkward moments for the filmmaker,
who tries to juggle the themes of an interfaith romance and of a priest
trying to face his vow of celibacy, and of how both men fall for the
same girl. It also depicts how both religious men try to shake up the
complacency in their congregations, mainly with pop culture brought into
their traditional services, and with an interfaith community center they
both initiate featuring karaoke music. Rabbi Jake amusingly brings in a
Harlem gospel choir to sing the Jewish holiday song "Ein Kelohainu."
Both religious men use their abilities as stand-up comedians to fill
their Upper West Side congregations and seem happy with their choice of
vocation.
The film opens with a drunk Brian sitting in an empty bar and telling an
incredulous bartender the story of why he is drunk...the old story of a
rabbi and a Catholic priest... but this time with a slightly different
twist! The film goes into flashback and Brian tells how Jake fell in
love with Anna, but that Jake felt he couldn't do anything about it
because it would break his mother's heart (Bancroft), as he tells of how
she cut off his brother from the family because he married a non-Jewish
girl, and how it would upset the congregation and its conservative
leader (Rifkin), probably causing him to lose his job. Jake's other
problem is that the congregation does not want a bachelor rabbi and
exerts pressure on him to marry a Jewish girl.
Anna's problem is that she is married to the cell phone; she is always
on the job, which leaves her feeling soulless; and, she is thinking for
the first-time now that she is 29-years-old, that life has past her by,
that she might have placed the wrong values about what is important in
life. She is ready to love Jake but because of the cultural problems
involved, the romance is ending.
For Brian, the problem is that he has fallen in love with Anna and
doesn't know about her romance with Jake. When she calls him late one
night when she is upset that Jake left her, he assumes, that she wants
to see him because she feels the same about him and doesn't know what to
do. In one of many awkward scenes, to make its point about religious
restrictions, Brian foolishly starts kissing her and telling her he will
give up his vows for her. She then tells him about Jake...which is the
reason for his drinking binge.
The film spends a lot of energy going back and forth among these
characters, trying to understand why they are all so upset.
In Jake's congregation, the members consider him a most eligible
bachelor and fix him up with their daughters. It shows him on two dates
and both with results that were not as funny as they were intended to
be. On the first, a sexually aggressive date (Edelstein) tries to get
him to take her into the bedroom against his better judgment. On the
second, an ABC news correspondent (Sofer) tries to connect with him over
a dinner date, where he brings along Anna and Brian. There actually
didn't seem to be any reason why he shouldn't be going out with her, but
for Anna, and because the plot of the film is skewed that he shouldn't
meet a Jewish woman.
In between all these serious problems, the film is able to work best
when it brings in its lowbrow comedy routines and pratfalls in diverse
moments: a thirteen year old boy whose voice is breaking at his
Bar-Mitzvah, the rabbi being an avid collector since childhood of
"Heroes of the Torah" trading cards jumps for joy at receiving a hero
rabbi card, the rabbi faints at a circumcision ritual, the priest
jumping butt-first into the holy water when his robes catch on fire, Ken
Leung as a pushy karaoke machine salesman who loves to sing, and a
hostile security guard who gives the film a Charlie Chaplin slapstick
flavor to it.
The film was only mildly pleasing for the following reasons: Jenna
Elfman was too attractive and had too much of a sunny disposition for
either rabbi or priest, therefore the romance part of the film never
took off. She was what she was, a high-level corporation person on the
rise, more suited for someone in her field than either of these two
childhood friends. The romance between her and the rabbi was not only
unlikely, but not convincingly done. The pace of the film was
meandering, focusing too much attention on close-ups of Jenna and the
side-bar subplots that added nothing relevant to the story. The story
itself, which tried to be cute and touch upon current controversies,
added nothing new by its discoveries. The film stopped dead in its
tracks when it took itself too seriously and a series of sermons were
delivered about how Ben Stiller should resolve his love problem. Its
premise promised something groundbreaking to say about a nice Jewish boy
loving a gentile, but ended up mimicking the traditionalists: if she
wants to marry, let her convert.
What the film did fairly well, was show a tolerant attitude by both the
retiring rabbi (Eli Wallach) and the veteran priest (Milos Forman), who
talked to the younger men in a kind way and gave them helpful reminders
of who they are without trying to force something down their throat.
For first-time director and all-around actor Edward Norton (FightClub/
The People vs. Larry Flynt/ American History X), this was a curious film
for him to choose to direct, since he chose one that is particularly
lightweight, considering some of his acting roles have been in
cutting-edge films, which makes you wonder where he's coming from.. The
results are that the film is more awkward than controversial, more
secular in spirit than religious, and it revisits grounds that are all
too familiar and have been done far better by people like Woody Allen.
That love wins out over faith, should surprise no one who has watched
Hollywood films over the years and how they love to give people the
endings that make them feel-good, and most people feel-good when they
see lovers who love each other be together in the end. The best one can
say about this film, was that its heart was in a better place than its
script. The worst that can be said about it, was that its responses to
the controversies it brought up, were decided in too timid a way for the
film to leave any impact.

KEEPING THE FAITH [Norton] -- Nothing more than passable fluff, really,
which I guess ain't bad, but I do prefer characters that I can truly
sympathize-slash-empathize with and I suppose Norton had it toughest:
the majority of the movie going public isn't exactly made up of Catholic
priests. Thankfully, first-time director/actors tend to be especially
critical of their performances; thus, his character, who bothered me
quite a bit until reel three, is absent from the majority of the
romantic proceedings. The subject-matter doesn't lend itself to any
particular visual style (other than the typical prose of Nora Ephron,
who is thanked in the end credits), so we, as an audience, are left
wondering if Nortion can really direct. But then, there's that whole
other mystery entirely: Who ever would've envisioned *Edward Norton* as
director of a romantic-comedy? By the way, Ben Stiller is a genius. C+

The romantic comedy, "Keeping the Faith," marks the directoral debut of
Edward Norton and, as a director, Norton remains one hell of a terrific
actor. Not that this is a bad film. "Keeping the Faith" boasts three
appealing leads along with a host of charming supporting players. Many
scenes are quite effective and the New York City production is
refreshingly sunny.
But the movie is simply too much. Situations are resolved too easily.
The opening segment, featuring slapstick that does not fit the
characters, is too cutesy. The story is too talky and, at two hours and
seven minutes, it's too long for a romantic comedy. If the infinitely
more complex classic, "The Philadelphia Story," was able to tie its
storylines together in 112 minutes, surely Norton could have wrapped
this baby up in an hour and a half.
But first time directors are notorious for throwing in everything but
the kitchen sink. And when the first time director is working from a
script written by an old college buddy (Yale alum and former investment
banker Stuart Blumberg), the prospect of trimming the screenplay must be
especially hard.
Blumberg's story is a twist on the tried and true romantic triangle, not
to mention the beginning of countless old jokes that start with "A
priest and a rabbi" Brian (Norton), Jake (Ben Stiller) and Anna (Jenna
Elfman) were childhood friends until Anna moved away, leaving her pals
broken-hearted. Years later, when the adult Anna returns to NYC,
circumstances have changed dramatically. Brian is an idealistic priest,
Jake a scrappy rabbi and Anna a high-powered executive with a cell phone
growing out of her hand.
Then Jake falls for Anna, Anna falls for Jake and the two secretly begin
dating, while Brian quietly falls for Anna and spends a lot more time
than usual praying and keeping his hands out of his pockets. Soon, the
friendship between the men begins to fray, as Jake slacks off on his
work for the interfaith community center that has long been their dream
project. Of course, Brian eventually learns the reason why and you can
take it from there.
The premise is sturdy enough, but the principal characters talk it to
death. For that matter, the supporting cast does a great deal of
yammering as well. And then there are the subplots and grafted on
slapstick (a rabbi who faints at a bris? Give me a break).
For the most part, Edward Norton's direction is solid, with one notable
exception. About two thirds of the way through, there is an extended
scene of Brian and Jake chatting outdoors. In each shot where the camera
is positioned behind Brian's head facing Jake, Brian's lines are
obviously dubbed in. When Jake finishes talking, we hear Brian, but his
jaw either doesn't move, or moves out of synch with his lines. Come on,
Norton, this is a romantic comedy, not a Godzilla movie.
As far as date movies go, "Keeping the Faith" is smarter and more
genuine than most. But with a tighter script and less shtick, it could
have been much, much better.

I could picture Paul Mazursky (NEXT STOP GREENWICH VILLAGE, BLUME IN LOVE,
TEMPEST) making this film in the 70's, possibly casting Richard Benjamin in the
Ben Stiller role and Donald Sutherland in the Edward Norton role. He would give
the film an edge, address ideological concerns, and make us laugh. Norton, who
also directed, just makes us laugh, and I'm not the least bit ungrateful (well
maybe a wee bitsy bit) but it would seem that an actor so edgy in his roles
(from THE FIGHT CLUB to AMERICAN HISTORY X) would want to do more than make
what feels like an homage to the innocuous fare of Rob Reiner and Gary
Marshall. But like I said, it made me laugh, so I'll excuse Norton for aiming
lower than I would have preferred.
In KEEPING THE FAITH Ben Stiller plays Jake, a renegade rabbi (yes, you did
read that correctly) eager to jazz up those "boring" religious services with
some unconventional techniques like group meditation and even inviting a gospel
chorus to belt out prayers. Meanwhile nearly every female member of the
congregation is just itching to get into Jake's tallas. Norton gives himself
the decidedly bland role of Brian the priest, a character who mostly functions
as Jake's best friend. These two are childhood chums along with a third, Anna,
a sweet Irish girl who moved away just when the trio's friendship was
blossoming. She returns fifteen years later to meet them in New York. Now the
sweet little girl is a beautiful blonde businesswoman played by Jenna Elfman,
who is getting less and less annoying with every consecutive picture she
appears in (see her at her most irritating in a movie I'm still trying to
forget, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBEâŚeven typing that title conjures up awful
celluloid reminisces). Though both men develop crushes on their old friend,
Jake is the one who gets lucky when Anna reveals that she has similar feelings
for him. They begin a love affair without telling Brian.
The film works mostly on the strengths of its performers. Norton shines,
proving as adept at physical comedy and clever witticisms as he is at
controlled intensity. Milos Foreman (who directed Norton in THE PEOPLE VS LARRY
FLYNT) effectively fulfils all the requisite duties as Brian's wise old mentor.
Anne Bancroft is thankfully restrained as the Jewish mother, a type of role
that many an actress (Hello Shelly Winters!) have gleefully over-exaggerated.
Jake's prospective paramour's are well played by the very funny Lisa Edelstein
as a fitness buff who asks Jake to punch her, and Catherine Zeta Jones
look-alike Rena Sofer as a self-involved news anchor who seems completely
intoxicated by her own good looks. Elfman is unusually charming, and judging
from her performance here, I can actually see myself warming up to her as a
leading lady.
KEEPING THE FAITH also generates some (unintentional) laughter from a severe
height difference between the statuesque Elfman and midget-like Stiller. In the
awful film version of FRANKIE AND JOHNNY (directed by Gary Marshall) the crew
reportedly had to dig ditches to put Michelle Phieffer in, in order for her
love interest, the diminutive Al Pacino, to appear her height. Stiller gets no
such consideration, instead he must hop around Elfman looking like a little
puppy dog angling for a kiss. The actor, who I found enormously annoying just
six years ago in REALITY BITES, has grown into a rather likeable comic leading
man. He has mastered the witty-hang-dog charm of (take your pick) John Cusack
and Robert Downy Jr., and let go of the faux-Woody Allen impersonation that
brought down the bar on most of his early performances. Despite the
unintentional (I think) sight gag of Stiller and Elfman (a visual I will
picture in my head whenever I feel glum) those two do generate a considerable
amount of chemistry, unlike Julia Roberts and the blinking, stuttering mess
that is Hugh Grant in NOTTING HILL. Compared to NOTTING HILL and most other
contemporary studio romantic comedies, KEEPING THE FAITH is a winner. Its cast
has appeal to spare, but I couldn't help but wish they were using it at the
service of a more challenging screenplay.
There are so many directions in which this story could have gone that it
disappoints me a little to see it take such a worn out route. How about a love
story between the priest and the rabbi? This is not only new, but we still have
the sight gag of a tiny Stiller bounding around a towering (by comparison)
Norton. Or maybe a SHAMPOO-like comic character study, but instead of a
womanizing hairdresser, a womanizing rabbi. Stiller's performance hints
slightly at low key insolence, he could be the kind of guy capable of taking
advantage of all the affection his ardent female fans offer him. I would have
liked to see that taken somewhere. But alas we must settle for predictability.
The characters go and do what we expect. They follow an outline, though Norton
and writer Stuart Blumberg make them mostly intelligent, funny, and charming,
even added comic relief from a wily Asian salesman (a hilarious Tony Leung) and
an Indian\Irish bartender work, when in most films they wouldn't rise above
annoyingly insincere caricatures. Here they are still caricatures, but fun
caricatures, given entertaining post millennium multi-cultural back-stories.
Norton gets a hand full of kudos for making good use of the New York City
locale; a city known for its richness in diverse ethnicities, a fact that Woody
Allen's films always ignore. Allen sees New York as a haven for elitist Jews
rather than the cultural melting pot it is.
But I still feel Norton missed out on an opportunity to make a substantive
comic drama about opposing religions between pals, the kind of film we would
remember in the future the way many recall the THE GRADUATE or CARNAL
KNOWLEDGE. Instead he chose to make a product, one that is glossy, well made,
and amusing, but one that feels manufactured rather than from the heart.
Despite all my caveats I still find myself, days after watching the film,
thinking about and smiling at Stiller's wry delivery or Leung's chuckle worthy
rendition of Rick Springfield's JESSE'S GIRL. If I weren't so damn picky I'd
probably give the film a solid B, but then I'd be plagued with guilt so we'll
leave it as it is. And as it is it looks as if Edward Norton would like to
follow in the footsteps of Rob Reiner, which is something you can take however
you wish.

     It is not easy to write a film about a romantic triangle and not
cover territory that has been covered by countless other romantic
triangle films like HIS GIRL FRIDAY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.  Stuart
Blumberg's script for KEEPING THE FAITH does it by filling in what
would be dull spaces with insight and comedy about Judaism and
Catholicism.  Two of the three main characters are clergymen wanting to
try unconventional approaches to make their services more enjoyable,
relevant, and in general more inviting.  Each has to buck an
establishment tied to more traditional approaches to religious
services.  The two men's presence pits the more conservative and
generally older members of their congregations against a younger
generation more open to newer ideas.  KEEPING THE FAITH can flit back
and forth from the main plotline to the religious subplots and never
get dull.  On the whole the film mixes two parts humor with one part
seriousness.  And one thing that sets this film apart from so many
other films is just that the jokes really are funny.  It is unusual
these days to find a writer who can be funny without sacrificing taste.
Perhaps there will be small numbers of Catholics and Jews that will be
uncomfortable with some of the "new approaches," but it is done in a
much more loving fashion than similar sorts of humor in last year's
DOGMA.
     Back in Junior High both Jake Schram and Brian Finn became fast
friends with cute and plucky Anna Reilly.  Sadly, after a year or so
Anna had to move away.  Jake and Brian both had ideas on how to make
their respective religions more fun and more relevant.  Jake (Ben
Stiller) became a rabbi and Brian (Edward Norton) becomes a priest.
Each tries to modernize his religion, sometimes with surprising and
unorthodox results.  Brian mixes services with stand-up comedy.  Jake
mixes new forms of music into the Jewish service.  Then comes the day
that Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) contacts Brian and tells him she is
returning to New York.  Anna, who has matured into a stunning beauty is
now a workaholic repairing businesses.  She is addicted to her cell
phone.  The story goes back and forth between the two men's religious
careers and their attraction to the woman both love, but who is
forbidden to each of them.  Jake is looking for a wife, but is only
willing to marry a Jew.  Brian is Anna's religion, but the vows of his
priesthood force him to remain celibate.  Like a Seinfeld episode, for
a long time nothing much happens but the characters discussing their
situation.  But Anna's attraction is too great to resist forever.  Each
of the men must gauge how deeply he feels about Anna and how deeply
about his religion.
     It was claimed that watching just Spencer Tracy listening was more
interesting than watching other actors speak.  That seems to have been
a lesson learned by Jenna Elfman.  If the name is familiar, she is
married to a nephew of film composer Danny Elfman.  Jenna Elfman never
just stands waiting for her next line.  She is inconstant motion and
reacts to every line spoken.  This is just the sort of actor other
actors hate to play opposite since she grabs the attention of most of
the audience, certainly most of the males.  Edward Norton demonstrated
in PRIMAL FEAR, AMERICAN HISTORY X, and THE FIGHT CLUB that he can do
some dynamic personalities.  But in KEEPING THE FAITH he comes off just
a bit bland.  Ben Stiller is more serious here than in films like
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, but he carries the serious moments as well as the
comic ones.  In addition there are some veteran actors in smaller roles
including Anne Bancroft, Ron Rifkin, and Eli Wallach.  There is even a
small role for director Milos Forman.
     Anastos N. Michos gives us some moderately good photography of New
York and this film gives us a counter-example to the usual wisdom that
no good film ever starts with an overhead shot of New York.  One
quibble: one of the women Jake dates is a Jewish news commentator who
specializes in the Middle East and frequently is sent to Iraq and
Libya.  I do not believe that Jewish women get a lot of cooperation in
the Arabic countries in the Middle East.
     This is a film that beats a lot of odds to be an intelligent
romantic comedy that is constantly entertaining.  While the end seems a
little strained, it is better than one might expect.  I rate it a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

There's a lot to like in actor Edward Norton's directorial debut, KEEPING 
THE FAITH.  First, it's a solid romantic comedy, a hard genre to make.  
Second, it's intelligent in its treatment of religious themes, in a time in 
which it is rare to see the spiritual side of characters.  Finally, the 
acting and cast are first rate.  For how much more could a viewer ask?
A small frame for the story has Father Brian Finn (Norton) stagger into a 
bar to continue his jag of drinking.  He gets the tender of the deserted bar 
(Brian George) interested in what seems like the most outlandish rabbi and 
priest joke of all time.  Of course the story ends up being an account of 
his own life, starting with his childhood.  It seems Brian and his best 
friend Jake met as boys, and added another best friend in the form of `Anna 
Banana,' a tomboy named Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman).  The only problem was 
that Anna broke up the young Musketeers when her father moved the family to 
California.
But now Anna is back as an assertive and canny corporate type; she's `like a 
plumber,' only she fixes leaky companies.  Although she works far too many 
hours, she makes time to spend with her old buddies Jake and Brian.  The 
film follows the renewal of the three-way friendship, including some 
hilarious bits in which Jake  a very eligible rabbi  plays the dating game 
with women sent his way by numerous matchmakers  everyone from a 
exercise-obsessed Jewess to a rising star at ABC News, Rachel Rose (Rena 
Sofer).
So, what's the big conflict already?  Well, Jake begins seeing Anna, and the 
two decide to keep their passion secret  not only from Jake's congregation 
but also from Brian.  Meanwhile, Brian experiences his own crisis, dreaming 
about Anna and reading signals wrong until he confesses his own love for 
Anna.
So the theme of love permeates the story.  Often it is kept very human, 
especially when we see two men of God struggling to come to terms with the 
strictures that hamper or forbid relationships.  And some of the shtick with 
Ben Stiller invites out-loud laughter  though it would have been nice not 
to have had a few of these moments spoiled by the trailer!
As boys, Jake and Brian always showed acceptance and curiosity about each 
other's faith.  Fortunately, the film preserves the tone set by the boys: it 
explores many of the ideas and rituals important to Catholicism and Judaism. 
  Often Brian visits the temple at which Jake is junior rabbi, and Jake 
visits the church and rectory at which Brian is associate pastor.  Some of 
the most charming scenes outside of the triangular love plot involve 
ministry: for instance, Brian in the confessional (where was the 
reconciliation room, eh?) with an Hispanic kid whose raging hormones cause 
his sinful thoughts.  The temple and church even get together to sponsor an 
interfaith community center, complete with kareoke machine.  All of this 
niceness becomes an artifice, though, when it becomes clear that the board 
that runs the temple is displeased with Jake's behavior: why is he dating a 
shiksa when there's all these nice Jewish girls?  And would a real priest, 
who does not drink, instantly resort to large quantities of booze, creating 
suddenly that trite monster, the alcoholic Irishman?  Realsitic, no.  Funny, 
yes, and largely because Stuart Blumberg's screenplay does not go out of its 
way to be politically correct.
Still in his twenties, Edward Norton has shown amazing versatility.  
Comparing Father Brian Finn with the reformed skinhead Norton played in 
AMERICAN HISTORY X gets a stunned reaction.  Everything from the hair and 
eyebrows to the attitude and mannerisms is drastically different.  And 
Norton mines the wealth of Catholic and Jewish material fairly well.  Ben 
Stiller even gets to do a grand bit of physicality with a building security 
bull named T-Bone.
Stiller does a nice job of playing the modern man of religion, improvising 
much of his sermons, causing doctrine to be more accessible to his 
congregation.  And the man has just about perfected his comic timing.  (Why 
doesn't he make a movie with both his parents, by the way???)  I didn't mind 
the way Jake dressed; his black leather jacket went well with Father Brian's 
Roman outfit and with the elder rabbi's garb.  But Stiller's spiky hair 
looked a little silly sticking up around his yarmulke!
It's not hard to imagine Norton asking several of his older pals to play 
support.  The director Milos Forman has a small role as Father Havel, the 
Czech refugee who's been a priest in New York since he fled his homeland in 
1968.  On what subject does he counsel Father Brian?  Love!
The priest's counterpart is played by Eli Wallach.  It's always enjoyable to 
see such a veteran on the screen again, with his easy manner and very 
recognizable voice.
Anne Bancroft plays Mrs. Shram, Jake's mother.  Apparently she has disowned 
Jake's older brother (they've not even communicated in two years) for 
marrying a non-Jewish girl.  Hence Jake's added anxiety over dating Anna.  
Bancroft is a wonderfully natural actress.  A small problem that confronts 
her here, though, comes when she makes a sudden and uncharacteristic 
decision toward the end of the story.
Without a few of the suggestive love scenes between Jake and Anna, KEEPING 
THE FAITH would have been rated PG, instead of PG-13.  Too bad.  The current 
release RETURN TO ME is showing a refreshing `return' to more wholesome 
romantic comedy, and FAITH contains many of the same successful conventions. 
  Anyway, both films are a welcome break from the excess of `R' flicks 
gazing down from the marquees of America's multiplexes!

         In the course of only four years and a handful of movies,
Edward Norton has firmly established himself as a versatile,
extraordinarily gifted performer. Whether he's playing a schizoid murder
suspect ("Primal Fear"), a singing and dancing lawyer ("Everybody Says I
Love You"), a rehabilitated neo-Nazi ("American History X") or a
neurotic societal drop-out ("Fight Club"), Norton seems to have
cultivated an uncanny knack for disappearing into the part.
 Like so many actors, Norton also wants to direct, and based on
the results of his first effort, "Keeping the Faith," that may not be as
hazardous as it sounds. Far from being a "look at me!" vanity production
along the lines of Kevin Costner's "The Postman" or Barbra Streisand's
"The Mirror Has Two Faces," "Faith" is a cheerful, endearing ode to
friendship and the magic of Manhattan. An admirer of Woody Allen, Norton
has made his own "Annie Hall" here, and if the homage isn't the equal of
the original, so what? It's entertaining nevertheless.
Admittedly, it does take a little while for the movie to find its
bearings, and many of the scenes that introduce our heroes Father Brian
Finn (Norton) and Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller) are so broadly played
and full of slapstick it looks as if "Faith" should have been titled
"There's Something About Clergy." But after about 15 minutes of begging
for laughter, the film finally settles down and begins concentrating on
its characters.
 And what characters they are. Brian and Jacob have been friends
for over 20 years and, despite their different beliefs, they find they
still have plenty in common, including unresolved crushes on Anna Riley,
the neighborhood tomboy who moved away just before they started junior
high school. Now Anna (Jenna Elfman) has returned to New York as a
svelte, high-powered business consultant -- "I'm like a plumber, except
I fix leaky corporations," she explains -- who's been so caught up in
her career she hasn't had time to think about romance.
 That's good news and bad news for the boys. Jacob has been
anxiously looking for a wife, but fears there will be trouble at the
temple if he marries a gentile. Brian, who had never before doubted his
choice of vocation, begins to wonder if he could give it up to be with
Anna.
 "Keeping the Faith" handles these conflicts with humor, but at
the same time the film doesn't treat them lightly. After so many years
of seeing priests portrayed onscreen as either sheep to be led astray
("The Thorn Birds"), dithering do-nothings ("End of Days") or
hungry-eyed perverts who lust after little boys ("The Butcher Boy"),
"Faith" tries to remind us many men of the cloth are essentially
well-balanced human beings. The pangs of guilt and self-doubt Brian
endures don't turn him into a monster; instead they challenge him to
examine his life and to make some hard decisions about where he wants to
go next.
 Norton, Stiller and Elfman are delightful to watch, both
individually and collectively. Elfman is a particularly happy surprise,
shaking off the shrillness that marked her roles in "EdTV" and
"Krippendorf's Tribe" to reveal her playful side. Norton, who hasn't had
much of a chance to show off his comic side in films before, sparkles,
particularly in the scenes in which he and Anna try to make sense of
their unorthodox relationship.
 Although it tends to get a trifle long-winded, Stuart
Blumberg's screenplay includes plenty of clever bits: Jacob complains
about a potential date who faxed her resume to him and put down
"jogging" as one of her skills; Brian incorporates references to the
Fugees and Brad Pitt into his sermons. Under Norton's direction,
"Keeping the Faith" typically goes for many little laughs instead of a
few howlers. It all adds up to two very pleasant hours sure to raise
your spirits. James Sanford

     KEEPING THE FAITH is not a feature length version of the old joke
about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar ... not exactly, anyway. 
The set-up finds director/co-star Edward Norton exploiting exactly that
concept as his character -- New York Catholic priest Brian Finn -- relates
the film's story to an incredulous barkeep. It seems that Brian has been
friends since childhood with Jake Schram (Ben Stiller), who grew up to
become a rabbi. Their middle-school cohort also included Anna Reilly
(Jenna Elfman), who moved away to California fifteen years earlier but has
recently returned to New York for her job. Her return creates romantic
tensions between the three friends, what with vows of chastity,
Jewish/Gentile relationship conflicts and all.
     There's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also
introduces questions of faith, cultural and religious melting pots and
balancing career and personal goals. And KEEPING THE FAITH seems intent on
covering every last square foot of it. Brian and Jake, each in his way,
sets out to shake up the complacency of their respective congregations
(usually with some sort of pop culture reference point in the mix). Anna
struggles with whether her go-go job as a corporate consultant has left
her soulless. Characters fret over how others will perceive their
decisions to cross cultural barriers. Screenwriter Stuart Blumberg dashes
madly back and forth between themes, while Norton dashes madly back and
forth between tones (how else to describe a sentimental romance that also
includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of
"Heroes of the Torah" trading cards?). Oh, and somewhere along the way
they're supposed to fit in a love story. It's no wonder Norton felt the
need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus.
     Thank heaven that KEEPING THE FAITH is often quite funny in its
fragmented, scattershot way. Blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue,
and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces (including a Jewish American
Princess date from hell). Stiller continues to build a body of comic
screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries, giving zing to
Jake's self-deprecating manner. There are eye-catching bit parts,
including Ken Leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman. 
And there's Jenna Elfman, who has never particularly impressed me in the
past except as a ball of energy. Here she's a completely convincing object
of desire (even if Norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly),
luminous, intelligent and driven. As one part of a romantic pairing, she's
a tough act to match.
     The match, as it turns out, becomes one of KEEPING THE FAITH's bigger
problems. Eventually the story pairs Anna with Jake, inspiring gags
surrounding Jake's fear of offending either his mother (Anne Bancroft) or
his more conservative congregation members by dating a Gentile. The
premise is sound enough, but Stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic
lead. In fact, there's more plausible chemistry between Elfman and Norton,
and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected
to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of
personalities. How much more interesting -- and daring -- KEEPING THE
FAITH might have been if the film had suggested Anna was merely
sublimating her desire for Brian with Jake, making for much tougher
choices at the film's conclusion.
     That's probably too much to ask from a film that, at its core, is a
fairly fluffy Hollywood confection. It's another one of those love poems 
to New York as the place where nice Jewish boys meet the goys of their
dreams, like ANNIE HALL or WHEN HARRY MET SALLY only less effective as
romance or comedy (though more than a match in romanticized Manhattan
skyline shots). It's certainly a pleasant enough diversion, good for more
than enough chuckles to make it worth a look, but it's surprisingly timid
for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements. It's also a lot
warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of "a
priest and a rabbi walk into a bar..."

As "Keeping the Faith" begins, Brian Finn (Edward Norton) staggers into a New
York bar.  He sits morosely staring at a picture of three children.  The Indian
bartender (Brian George), who wears a "Kiss Me I'm Irish" sticker, offers an
ear and insists that, whatever Brian's problem is, he's heard it before.  Brian
unzips his jacket to reveal the collar of a Catholic priest.  The bartender
responds, "This I gotta hear."
The three children in the photo are young Brian and his best friends Jake
Schram and Anna Reilly.  As they grew, the boys lost track of Anna but remained
close to each other.  While Brian became a priest, Jake (Ben Stiller) became a
rabbi.  Both are committed to dusting off their respective religions and to
bringing the faiths together.  They preach their sermons like stand-up
comedians warming up a crowd.  Jake brings a black choir into his synagogue to
sing.  Together Brian and Jake are opening an inter-faith kareoke lounge.  They
like to think of themselves as "the God Squad."
Re-enter Anna (Jenna Elfman), now a high-powered corporate consultant.  She is
still a person of unbridled energy who shakes up the guys' lives.  As the
twosome again becomes a threesome, Jake is facing a problem.  In order to be
promoted at his synagogue, he needs to get married.  The "Kosher Nostra," the
mothers in his congregation, are constantly offering him daughters he can't
refuse, including a body-building nymphomaniac (Lisa Edelstein) and a network
news correspondent (Rena Sofer).  However, Jake finds himself drawn to Anna,
who isn't Jewish.  While they begin having an affair, Brian also falls in love
with her, leading to tension between the three friends.
"Keeping the Faith" is a joyous feel-good movie because it celebrates the
collapsing of barriers between races and religions.  The supporting characters
are a melting pot of different peoples living in harmony.  The movie also
treats religious vocations with respect, even making them seem fun at times. 
(Maybe too much fun:  as a gentile, I wondered whether Jake was breaking any
rules when he jumps in bed with Anna).  With fewer young men entering the
priesthood, I wonder if Edward Norton might be the best recruiting icon since
Bing Crosby.  The Catholic and Jewish humor is the gentle sort that these
groups make about their own religions.  First-time screenwriter Stuart Blumberg
delivers a very witty script filled with clever pop culture references.  All in
all, "Keeping the Faith" is the funniest movie I've seen this year.
This is the directorial debut of Edward Norton.  In his brief film career,
Norton has received two Oscar nominations.  In "Keeping the Faith," he not only
proves himself a capable director but also shows a talent for comedy that he
hasn't been able to explore in such weighty fare as "Primal Fear," "The People
vs. Larry Flynt," and "American History X."  Of course, Ben Stiller and Jenna
Elfman are always funny, and both are in fine form here.  The supporting cast
includes Anne Bancroft as Jake's mother, Eli Wallach as the senior rabbi in
Jake's synagogue, and Milos Forman (making a rare acting appearance) as Brian's
mentor.
There was one horrendous flaw in the film when I saw it, but I'm hoping that a)
the flaw was only in the preview version and will be fixed before "Keeping the
Faith" goes into general release or b) I was incredibly mistaken.  Anyway, the
problem was that a few scenes were out of order.  At one point in the movie,
Brian arrives at Anna's apartment in response to a phone call to find that she
has broken up with Jake.  But the break-up and the phone call came showed up
later in the movie.  (Even after Brian has confronted Jake about all this.) 
Editing mistakes are usually subtle continuity errors and the like, so I'm
scratching my head in astonishment that such a boneheaded set of mistakes could
slip through.  I hope the next time I see it, "Keeping the Faith" will be the
polished product it ought to be.

*** (out of 4) So this priest walks into a bar and pulls out a picture
of a priest, a rabbi, and a businesswoman....
Thus begins Edward Norton's career as a comedy director.
Norton directs himself and Ben Stiller as a priest and a rabbi,
respectively. The two have been best friends since childhood. Both now
live and work in New York. Both mix a portion of humanistic fun into
their reverence for tradition, and both have packed their congregations
with young, energetic crowds.
But the movie isn't about their professional lives; it's about their
friendship. While out shooting hoops one day, Brian (Norton) tells Jake
(Stiller) that their old friend Anna called. She was their best friend
in eighth grade, and both boys had a crush on her. Now she is coming to
town and she wants to see them.
Both men still carry a torch for Anna, but neither has much of a chance
with her. Brian has taken a vow of celibacy and he plans to stick to it.
Jake, on the other hand, feels pressure from his congregation to settle
down with a nice Jewish girl (which Anna is not).
When Anna comes to town, she impresses and confounds the two with her
feminine charm. She flirts with both of them, and they flirt back. But
there is also camaraderie among the three; a friendship and familiarity
that transcends mere flirtation. 
The rest of the film works through the holy geometry of this
friendship-and-love triangle.
There is much room for criticism in KEEPING THE FAITH. For one thing,
the character of Anna is a plot device, although Elfman's easy
friendship with the two leads helps flesh out her character. For
another, the movie is also too long, clocking in at about two hours
(most comedies are much shorter) The length becomes a problem toward the
end, when the plot starts rambling; it's as though Norton the director
didn't have the heart to cut Norton the screenwriter's words.
Yet there is much to like as well. KEEPING THE FAITH has some very good
lightweight dialogue. It has three appealing actors who share some good
on-screen energy. Also, it was nice to see a movie that includes matters
of faith and tradition -- not because they're handled in any new or
revealing way, but because they're acknowledged and factored in to
everyday life.

`Keeping the Faith' is a charming and entertaining
romantic comedy about friendship, fellowship, and
forgiveness.  The warmth that emanates from this film
lies within its message of
love-one-another-and-love-thyself.'  But the real
appeal stems from the sunniness radiated by cast
members Ed Norton, Ben Stiller, and Jenna Elfman who
play three old friends that reunite and who become
funnily entangled in a love triangle.
Brian Finn (Ed Norton) and Jake Schram (Ben Stiller)
have been close friends since the 8th grade, and as
they grew up, they answered similar callings.  Brian
becomes a priest while Jake grows up to become a
rabbi.  Things are going well for the both of them. 
They are now powerful spiritual leaders in their New
York West Side community.  Affectionately known as the
`God Squad,' these two give sermons in front of
standing-room-only audiences. 
One of Brian's and Jake's fondest memories was that of
Anna Reilly, another 8th grader who was the coolest
and hippest girl that they had ever known.  She had
moved away that year, but is now returning to New York
for a job.  Anna is all grown up now. She's a single,
sexy, business professional.  The three reunite and
they are enraptured by her indomitable wit and erotic
power.  
She's a tremendously busy woman who has no time for a
relationship.  She's great at what she does, but she
works 100 hours a week and misses the emotional
satisfaction of being touched and held.  Yet, she
doesn't say this as some kind of empty confession. 
There's a soft smile and an inviting wink that
accompanies her statement.  Perhaps she's developed an
attraction for either Brian or Jake.  This development
creates a problematic situation.  As friends, it
causes an awkward tension.  Even worse, Anna's
magnetism is taxing Brian's vows of celibacy while
Jake realizes that dating someone outside his faith
would jeopardize his standing among his congregates. 
This issue is made all the more salient by Jake's mom
(Anne Bancroft) who seems adamant against interfaith
marriages.  When their desires finally play out, we
can only hope that these three lifelong friends will
continue to remain close because they are so likeable.
The movie also provides additional comical nuggets of
the two clerics' lives.  The beginning sequence charts
Brian's and Jake's earlier days with their houses of
worship.  We laugh when Jake faints during a
circumcision or when Brian accidentally sets his
cassock on fire.  Another funny sequence involves a
shopping trip for a karaoke machine.  The salesperson
uses every dishonorable tactic to get them to buy the
machine, unaware that he's lying to a man of God. 
There's also an ongoing story about the elder Jewish
women in Jake's congregate, who continually try to
introduce him to their daughters.  One introduction
results in the date from Hell.  Upon arriving back at
her apartment in a taxi, she openly invites Jake
inside and tells the taxi driver to leave.  He seems
very afraid but when she becomes overly insistent,
Jake virtually has to push his aggressive date onto
the sidewalk as he frantically commands the taxi
driver to leave as quickly as possible.   
The real surprise of the film is Jenna Elfman, the
star of TV's `Dharma and Greg.'  I've never seen her
television show, but I'll be sure to make an effort
now.  To watch her is to love her.  The success of the
drama rests squarely on her shoulders, but she
effortlessly rises to the occasion.  Her portrayal was
pleasing, balancing coltish femininity with a hint of
loneliness.  Meanwhile, Norton and Stiller are equally
affable.  The film moves along at a good pace and
there are plenty of lighthearted moments to keep the
audience smiling.  `Keeping the Faith' is a sweet film
that showcases cheery performances, a likeable cast,
and a sustained comical energy.

Didja ever look at a cake and know that you should only eat a slice but,
maybe the munchies were setting in and, you ate the whole thing? That
kind of describes Edward Norton's debut directing style in Keeping the
Faith, a stylishly written and at times extremely funny story of a
priest a rabbi and the girl they've both loved since the sixth grade.
What starts at a boil (consider the idea of your local religious leader
doing standup at Services) soon falls to a low simmer, only
occassionally coming back to the full boil.
And only the priest walks into a bar, so you'll get none of those jokes
from me.
Brian Kilkenny Flynn (Edward Norton) is the Priest. Jacob Schram (Ben
Stiller) is the Rabbi. Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) is the grownup
corporate exec now returning to New York after a twenty something year
absence. The visit is temporary, Anna's gonna save another corporation,
but it affords her the opportunity to catch up with old friends.
Both men go to pick up their friend at the airport and when she walks
through the gates, both draws drop and testosterone levels flare. Of
course, one man is wearing a Roman collar and the other man is of the
wrong Faith, so whatcha gonna do other than be friends?
They're gonna do everything your dirty li'l minds are contemplating,
even as we speak. And they're gonna do it with style and sass and it's
all nicely written and a joy to watch . . . and watch some more . . .
and on and on and on, past the two hour mark (which is at least half an
hour too long for a romantic comedy). While it's a welcome change to see
Edward Norton do something light, when Elfman isn't on the screen,
mostly in the third act, the movie fades. Which is a roundabout way of
saying that Jenna Elfman delivers a terrific, big-name star level
performance (and this from a guy who doesn't like her teevee sitcom
Dharma and Greg at all). When she's on screen, any instinct to look at
your watch vanishes. She's funny, she's hot, she's kicking out the star
jams right and left.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Keeping the Faith, he would have
paid...

Susan Granger's review of "KEEPING THE FAITH" (Touchstone Pictures)
  Cleverly timed for the Passover and Easter season, this is
an amusing comedy about "The God Squad," two pious but unconventional
young men of religion, directed by actor Edward Norton, who is usually
associated with meaty dramas like "Primal Fear," "The People vs. Larry
Flynt," "American History X" and "Fight Club." Norton also plays
Father Brian Kilkenny Finn - a Roman Catholic priest. Brian's best
friend since childhood is now a Jewish rabbi named Jake Schram, played
by Ben Stiller. They're living near one another on New York's Upper
West Side when Anna Reilly, a young woman whom they grew up with
returns to the city on business. That's Jenna Elfman of "EDTV" and
"Dharma & Greg." So, instead of one of the old jokes that begins, "A
priest and a rabbi and a woman walk into a bar and....," this plot
ignites when a priest and a rabbi both care deeply for the same
woman. And this is no ordinary woman. She's a high-powered, cell
phone-addicted workaholic who firmly believes that with her help God
could have created the world in just three days, not seven. But she's
certainly not the "nice Jewish girl" whom the synagogue elders had
envisioned for their rabbi. And what about the priest's vow of
celibacy? The supporting cast is terrific: Anne Bancroft as Jake's
mother, Eli Wallach as an open-minded rabbi, and Milos Forman as a
compassionate priest. It's just too bad that first-time director
Norton didn't call "cut" more often when actor Norton's scenes went on
too long and that Stuart Blumberg's utterly predictable script gets a
bit verbose, but on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Keeping the
Faith" is a frothy, feel-good 7. In an age of cynicism, it's an
amiable, old-fashioned romantic comedy, a light-hearted date movie.

Turning a funny joke or situation into a movie often turns into a failure.
Recent Saturday Night Live movies (Superstar, A Night At The Roxbury) that were
based on short, 5 to 10 minute skits were painfully boring and unfunny. Most
people have heard the, "A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar" jokes, and some
are mildly amused, but this joke is stretched over a two hour plus movie
canvas. How long could the joke possibly last? Surprisingly, it sustains the
running time, and remains worthy of attention, even if the film is too long. 
Brian, the priest (Norton, also making his directorial debut with this film),
and the rabbi Jake (Stiller, of Mystery Men and There's Something About Mary),
are excited when old middle school friend Anna (Dharma and Greg's Jenna
Elfman), is coming to visit them in New York. Both of them had crushes on her
in middle school. Her flame rekindles itself in both men.  Jake, whose been on
one too many blind dates set up for him by women from his congregation quickly
falls for Anna the moment she steps off the plane. Brian feels passionate about
someone for the first time since he became a priest. Anna is a workaholic who
states that she has a relationship with her phone ("We just have this vibe
together") and is very charismatic and flirtatious with the two of them. She
wants to continue the friendly relations between them, even if Jake and Brian's
hearts say otherwise. Anna falls in love with one of them, but which one, and
how that affects the other, you'll have to see for yourself. That's it. The
story is pretty simple, and the priest is the only one who ever walks into a
bar. 
There is very little in Keeping The Faith to offend either one of the religions
featured. The movie tries hard to be inoffensive and appealing and does a great
job at both. This is truly, as Norton described in an interview, "A movie I
could take my grandma to." But would grandma stay awake? At 127 minutes Faith
clocks in at an unusually long running time for a romantic comedy, and the
movie really suffers from being that long. A half hour could have easily been
shaved off of the movie, which would have made it much more enjoyable. It
wouldn't seem nearly as slow when it gradually turns from a comedy to a full
out romance at about the half way mark. That said, the movie stays alive thanks
to great performances from it's three lead actors. Edward Norton proves time
and time again that he is a great actor with an amazing amount of versatility
and talent, Ben Stiller makes a good comeback from last year's unfunny
disappointment Mystery Men, and Jenna Elfman shows off more skill than her
Dharma role will probably ever let her. Also worth mentioning are Anne Bancroft
as Jake's overbearing mother and the over the top Ken Leung, who appears in two
scenes as a karaoke machine salesman and is the movie's biggest treat. There
are also some nice shots of New York City. Much of the humor is genuinely
funny, while a few jokes fall flat, the physical comedy found in recent films
isn't here. A good date movie that mixes comedy and romance into an enjoyable
fable about modern day love and religion. Even though it is pretty hokey, this
movie is still lots of fun.

KEEPING THE FAITH (2000) **3/4  Directed by Edward Norton. Written by 
Stuart Blumberg. Photography, Anastas Michos. Editing,  Malcolm 
Campbell. Production design, Wynn P.Thomas. Music, Elmer Bernstein 
Cast: Ben Stiller (Jake), Edward Norton (Brian), Jenna Elfman (Anna), 
Anne Bancroft (Ruth), Eli Wallach (Rabbi Lewis), Ron Rifkin (Larry 
Friedman), Milos Forman (Father Havel), Holland Taylor (Bonnie Rose), 
Ken Leung Don), Brian George (bartender) et al. Produced by Hawk 
Koch, Norton and Blumberg. A Touchstone release.  129 minutes. PG-13 
(delicate sexual setups)
Edward Norton is an excellent, versatile actor who has successfully 
avoided becoming stereotyped. This goes for this film too, where he 
plays a Catholic priest. And where Norton, in his first seating on a 
director's chair, has the tricky task of directing himself.
The results are OK. Not great, but still acceptably comedic-farcical. 
The script is pure feelgood Hollywood. You are always conscious that 
you are watching, and listening to, a movie.
In their teens, New Yorker schoolmates Brian, Jake and Anna were 
inseparable. Then the girl's family moved away. Cut to some 16 years 
later. The two men never ceased being best friends. Brian (Norton) is 
now Father Brian, a Catholic priest. Jake has become a rabbi. Both 
see each other all the time, even cooperate on projects. They are 
modern fellows, hep, hip and big hits with their congregations in New 
York's Upper West Side. (Jake's is noticeably upscale).
Anna, now a corporation executive in California is equally successful 
in her line of work. She goes back East for an indeterminate stay, to 
improve the efficiency of her company's New York office. She and the 
men meet for the first time in ages. The moment they see her at the 
airport they are stunned. The trio resume their old companionship.
Now here's the catch, and the movie's "raison d'etre" : both males 
fall in love with her, which means that they have a Big Problem 
--Brian because he is a priest, Jake because Anna is a "shiksa," a 
non-Jewish female.
While. of course, Brian cannot possibly get married, Jake knows that 
he should if he is to get promoted. In his synagogue, parents, and 
especially mothers, find him a most eligible catch for their 
daughters. Jake dates young women, with humorous results. But his 
attraction to Anna keeps growing. They become secret lovers, while 
Anna's relationship with Brian is such that the priest believes she 
feels unbrotherly love for him. What a mess!
Scenes and sequences more amusing than pathetic ensue, some directly 
involving the three principals, others colorfully peripheral.
I confess that I was constantly distracted by questions of height. 
When the three are seen together at the airport, it is obvious that 
Junoesque Anna is taller than Brian who is taller than Jake. But this 
keeps changing all the time. Take a reception attended by the 
Anna-Jake twosome. Within seconds the man goes from equal height to 
taller to less tall, and so on. There must have been hours spent on 
the sets placing boxes under Jake's feet, changing camera angles and 
perspectives, re-changing them.
Other aspects are less questionable, notably the funny ones. Such as 
a thirteen year old boy whose voice is breaking preparing for his 
Bar-Mitzvah. It's a scream and a screech. Such as the inevitable 
cell-phone gags. Or salesman Don whom the two clergymen visit for a 
Karaoke set. The young man switches from Asian English to New York 
accent in a flash, not to mention his singing performances. Or the 
irruption in the synagogue of a black choir, another device by Jake 
to shake up traditionalism. My favorite, seen early in the movie in a 
pre-flashback situation, is when a drunken Brian confides his 
troubles to a barman. The latter, a Sikh with a multi-national, 
multi-ethnic family background has the best and most humorous 
bar-person role I can remember. And so it goes.
On the negative side, the Anna character was uninteresting and left 
me cold. The film entertains, but while its comedy works the romantic 
part (as in "romantic comedy") is unconvincing. Jake, in a variety of 
ways, plays up too much to his congregation. The happy ending is a 
tacked-on cop-out. And the common wisdom that comedies have to be on 
the sorter side is ignored, to the story's detriment and creation of 
some yawns.
On the whole, however, "Keeping the Faith" is most watchable.

 Keeping the Faith (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ben Stiller,
Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman, Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, Milos Forman
and Ron Rifkin. Directed by Norton. Written by Stuart Blumberg.
 Hey, did you hear the one about the priest, the rabbi and the blonde
they both loved?
 That's the one-joke premise of "Keeping the Faith," a new comedy that
marks the directorial debut of actor Edward Norton.
 And while the film is an appealing romantic comedy, it does have its
drawbacks.
But let's stick with the positives for now.
 Best friends Jake Schram (Ben Stiller) and Brian Kilkenny Finn (Norton)
call themselves `the God Squad.' Jake is a rabbi, Brian, a priest. Both
are young and hip and want to take their respective flocks into the 21st
century.
 Both are popular, packing the pews at their respective houses of
worship.
 As children, Jake and Brian plus Anna Reilly were inseparable, the best
of friends. Then Anna's father was transferred to San Francisco.
 Years later, Anna (Jenna Elfman), now a high-powered executive, returns
to New York and looks up her old buddies. Once again the three are
inseparable.
Except that now, complications arise.
 Sparks begin to fly and a highly unusual love triangle develops, with
Anna in the middle.
 The trio make an attractive couple. The camera just loves Elfman. She
is beautiful, charismatic and a fine comedic actress with impeccable
timing instincts.
 Stiller is charming as the bachelor rabbi fending off all the mamas who
continually try to fix him up with their available daughters.
  is sincere and dedicated as a young priest who is wise, pragmatic and
spiritual.
 All three do well with their comic turns, especially Stiller who seems
continually harried as he tries to appease everyone in his Manhattan
congregation.
 And while "Keeping the Faith" is enjoyable, the script by Stuart
Blumberg, a fellow Yale graduate and classmate of Norton's, contains
some flaws. 
 Everything seems too glossy, crises are resolved too easily, situations
seem pat. 
 There doesn't seem to be any serious conflict. It's as if Blumberg
decided not to cross some invisible line, so he downplayed the real-life
consequences of a priest having bouts of self-doubt about his avocation,
or a rabbi fretting over the import of a relationship with a non-Jewish
woman.
 Yet, you can't help but like "Keeping the Faith." it is a sunny, New
York fairy tale with a fine supporting cast, including Anne Bancroft,
Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin and Milos Forman.
 As a director, Norton is fine with handling his actors. He never allows
the proceedings to go overboard.
 He knows how to use his camera and compose his shots. But he needs to
be more brutal in the editing room. At two hours and nine minutes,
"Keeping the Faith" contains a few dead spots that tighter editing could
have eliminated.
 "Keeping the Faith" offers another benefit. In this cynical age, its
comforting to see a movie about two intelligent young men who can commit
to a life that basically eschews the crass materialism and commercialism
that dominates our society.
 These are two  men who hear God's calling and answer it without
hesitation.
 The movie's resolution, unfortunately, is too simple, and a bit
unrealistic.
 But that should not discourage anyone from viewing this cheery
confection.
 What is especially interesting will be to watch Norton's maturation as
a director. With just seven movies under his belt as an actor, he
already has gained a reputation as one of the finest and most dynamic
actors in years.
 You can only imagine the heights he will be able to reach behind the
camera.

It's amazing where the day will take you.  Facing two movie 
doubleheaders this weekend, I was all set to be blown away by WHERE THE 
MONEY IS and bored spitless by KEEPING THE FAITH.  Would "oh ye of 
little faith" be too lame to say here?
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Brian (Edward Norton), Jake (Ben Stiller), and Anna (Jenna Elfman) were 
inseparable friends as kids; Anna moved to California with her family, 
leaving Brian and Jake behind in New York.  Brian grew up to be a 
priest, Jake became a rabbi, and both were determined to "kick the dust 
off faith", bringing it into the 21st century, by staying in touch with 
their community.  This is made somewhat difficult by the resistance of 
the elder rabbis (Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin) who want to maintain 
long-standing tradition.  Jake's life is further complicated by the 
matchmaking service is mother (Anne Bancroft) wants to perform for 
him--against his will.
Now all grown up and kinda sparkly, Anna reenters their lives when her 
business ("she's analyzing synergies, or synergizing analogies...") 
brings her back to New York.  And suddenly, the "cloth" that both men 
wear, fits a little too snugly for comfort.
The Upshot:
I have to be careful not to gush here, lest I go into every single, 
specific detail of what I liked about this movie.  And there are many 
things, not the least of which is the fact that though there's nothing 
particularly "new" in this movie--boy and boy meet girl; boy and boy 
fall for girl; girl move away; girl come back; boy and boy vie for her 
attention--the *way* it was told, and the sincerity with which it came 
across, was very refreshing.  And as jaded as I've been lately due to 
this pretty dreadful movie season, that's saying a lot.
When wearing his director's hat, Edward Norton brings a fresh view to 
the screen that's been missing for quite some time now.  Maybe in 
knowing that he was directing, I paid more attention than I normally 
would; but for a first-time feature film director (I think), he did an 
amazing job of getting good camera shots, without going overboard as far 
too many pretentious artistes do these days.  I especially liked his 
shots in and around the bar (uh, no pun intended); for some reason, they 
stood out as being different from anything that I've seen in a 
mainstream film recently.  Perhaps it's because even though the barroom 
banter was funny, it wasn't forced humor--and even further, because it 
felt intimate in a way, instead of in-your-face.  We've all heard the 
cliches about bartender-as-confessor; Norton somehow avoided the cliche 
and achieved a genuine sense of that reality, without making the humor 
maudlin.  Scenes like this exist throughout the movie; you get the 
feeling that there's a real and important story being told, rather than 
a mass of images moving swiftly to a conclusion.
But as enjoyable as Director Norton's work was to me, Actor Norton's 
performance as Father Brian Finn was even more fun to watch.  Whether 
with Jenna Elfman (with whom he had this incredible chemistry; Anna and 
Brian's relationship was much more convincing than was hers with Jake), 
Ben Stiller, or especially the great rapport he had with the "minor" 
supporting characters like the Bartender (Brian George) and Karioke Tong 
(Ken Leung), Norton's skill as an actor made me easily forget that this 
was the same man who played a skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X and an 
airhead in FIGHT CLUB.  It is a compliment to his abilities that the 
"priest on fire" scene that I've seen in the "Faith" trailer multiple 
times, was no less funny when I saw it in context of the movie; in fact, 
I think I laughed even harder than I did when I first saw it.  Norton is 
truly an underrated actor; and since the Academy is notoriously 
short-sighted when it comes to recognizing comedies at the podium, 
chances are that he'll remain unrewarded for his work here, too.
As I alluded to above, Elfman's best work was with Norton; leaving no 
traces of her flower child Dharma character (from the DHARMA AND GREG TV 
series), she impressed me most when she was dealing with Brian's "crisis 
of faith".  But to my pleasant surprise, I enjoyed Stiller's performance 
almost as much as I did Norton's, especially in their interactions 
together.  Ben Stiller is generally an acquired taste, one which I 
haven't picked up to date.  But in "Faith", he seemed less concerned 
about being "raw and edgy" than he has been in past performances (like 
his roles in MYSTERY MEN and BLACK AND WHITE, for instance).  Here, 
Stiller seems to sense the importance of his rabbi character's sincerity 
about his "flock", coming across, and it shows in his performance.  This 
is not to say that the good rabbi was all serious; as with Norton's 
trailer scenes, the previews with Stiller and "Workout Chick" (Lisa 
Eldestein) held up, if less so.   What really made me sit up and take 
notice, though, is that Stiller didn't allow his comedy bits to 
overshadow the overall character and Jake's struggles with being a 
needful human on the one hand, and feeling obligated to serve his 
congregation in the way he thought they needed him most, on the other.  
More than at any other time I've watched Stiller, I Felt his 
character--and liked him.
Just as I said to myself, "there's nothing about this movie I don't 
like!" near the end of the flick, it started to slow down to almost a 
crawl.  I was appreciative of that break, though; if I had been 
completely in love with this movie, I think I would've questioned my own 
sanity.  The flaws in it made me appreciate it all the more, from the 
efforts of the main cast, to the importance of the "minor" characters 
(that Bartender had me in absolute stitches, as did Tong), to the 
curiousness I've developed about Judaism, since I didn't understand a 
great deal what was going on with that aspect of the story.  If I may 
allow myself a single cliche--even at its worst, it was better than most.
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Actually, let's dish on "The Church Factor" today.  
As the daughter of a fiery Baptist mother, I connected to this flick on 
so many levels, especially when the rabbi and the priest attempted to 
get their respective members to participate more in the services.  The 
most obvious connection came when Jake brought the Black choir in to the 
synagogue, to liven up the services.  I was immediately taken back to 
the time when I was the drummer for a campus choir, and we stepped out 
of our ordinary performance rotation of Black Baptist and Pentacostal 
churches, by going to a White Presbyterian church, at their request.  
The experience was definitely memorable.  Though the scene was played 
for laughs on-screen, I have a feeling Jake's bunch had as good a time 
as we all did.  The church scenes also reminded me of the time when my 
holy-ghost-shoutin'/already-been-baptized mother went to a service at 
the Catholic church she would sometimes allow me to go to; remind me to 
tell you about it one day, but needless to say, St. Cecilia's was never 
quite the same after mama was in tha' house...
But beyond those connections, I related easily to Jake and Brian's 
message itself, that of trying to reach their members on a personal 
level: not through the recanting of years and years of traditional 
rites, but by appealing to their sense of community.  I'm probably 
telling on myself when I say that I've missed that aspect of my life 
most in my transition from being a member of a tight-knit community when 
I was growing up, to the supposedly sophisticated semi-suburban dweller 
that I am today.  Characters in a movie though they may be, I could dig 
being a member of either of the God Squad's congregations.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Hallelujah!  Finally, an unadulterated, unequivocally good movie in the 
year 2000.  Easily the best comedy so far this year, and a strong 
contender for best movie of this third of the year, period.
KEEPING THE FAITH (rating: greenlight): 
I'd say "Bless me, Father, for I have laughed", but I hate cliches.

director's chair, has the tricky task of directing himself.
The results are OK. Not great, but still acceptably comedic-farcical. 
The script is pure feelgood Hollywood. You are always conscious that 
you are watching, and listening to, a movie.
In their teens, New Yorker schoolmates Brian, Jake and Anna were 
inseparable. Then the girl's family moved away. Cut to some 16 years 
later. The two men never ceased being best friends. Brian (Norton) is 
now Father Brian, a Catholic priest. Jake has become a rabbi. Both 
see each other all the time, even cooperate on projects. They are 
modern fellows, hep, hip and big hits with their congregations in New 
York's Upper West Side. (Jake's is noticeably upscale).
Anna, now a corporation executive in California is equally successful 
in her line of work. She goes back East for an indeterminate stay, to 
improve the efficiency of her company's New York office. She and the 
men meet for the first time in ages. The moment they see her at the 
airport they are stunned. The trio resume their old companionship.
Now here's the catch, and the movie's "raison d'etre" : both males 
fall in love with her, which means that they have a Big Problem 
--Brian because he is a priest, Jake because Anna is a "shiksa," a 
non-Jewish female.
While. of course, Brian cannot possibly get married, Jake knows that 
he should if he is to get promoted. In his synagogue, parents, and 
especially mothers, find him a most eligible catch for their 
daughters. Jake dates young women, with humorous results. But his 
attraction to Anna keeps growing. They become secret lovers, while 
Anna's relationship with Brian is such that the priest believes she 
feels unbrotherly love for him. What a mess!
Scenes and sequences more amusing than pathetic ensue, some directly 
involving the three principals, others colorfully peripheral.
I confess that I was constantly distracted by questions of height. 
When the three are seen together at the airport, it is obvious that 
Junoesque Anna is taller than Brian who is taller than Jake. But this 
keeps changing all the time. Take a reception attended by the 
Anna-Jake twosome. Within seconds the man goes from equal height to 
taller to less tall, and so on. There must have been hours spent on 
the sets placing boxes under Jake's feet, changing camera angles and 
perspectives, re-changing them.
Other aspects are less questionable, notably the funny ones. Such as 
a thirteen year old boy whose voice is breaking preparing for his 
Bar-Mitzvah. It's a scream and a screech. Such as the inevitable 
cell-phone gags. Or salesman Don whom the two clergymen visit for a 
Karaoke set. The young man switches from Asian English to New York 
accent in a flash, not to mention his singing performances. Or the 
irruption in the synagogue of a black choir, another device by Jake 
to shake up traditionalism. My favorite, seen early in the movie in a 
pre-flashback situation, is when a drunken Brian confides his
troubles to a barman. The latter, a Sikh with a multi-national, 
multi-ethnic family background has the best and most humorous 
bar-person role I can remember. And so it goes.
On the negative side, the Anna character was uninteresting and left 
me cold. The film entertains, but while its comedy works the romantic 
part (as in "romantic comedy") is unconvincing. Jake, in a variety 
of  ways,  plays up too much to his congregation. The happy ending is 
a tacked-on cop-out. And the common wisdom that comedies have to be 
on the sorter side is ignored, to the story's detriment and creation 
of some yawns.
On the whole, however, "Keeping the Faith" is most watchable.

        Have you heard the one about the priest, the rabbi, and the
prostitute?  Of course you have.  Well now you can *see* the one about the
priest, the rabbi, and the workaholic.  It's called "Keeping the Faith" and
it's a romantic comedy about this comely threesome, firm friends in the 8th
grade who come together one wacky weekend and hooboy don't you know it the
two guys wind up falling for the same girl.  Edward Norton ("Fight Club")
is the priest, Ben Stiller ("Mystery Men") is the rabbi, and Jenna Elfman
("EdTV") is the corporate "plumber" (she talked McDonalds out of the
McOyster) and the object of their conflicted affections.  Conflicted in the
sense that Norton's character shouldn't be feeling this way, being a member
of the cloth an' all, and Stiller's character should be dating a Nice
Jewish Girl from the Bronx, not some fast-talking west coast blonde who's
surgically attached to her cell phone.  Stuart Blumberg's script touches on
the struggles between serving your god and servicing your woman, but since
this is a romantic comedy the emphasis leans more towards big laughs, of
which "Keeping the Faith" serves up plenty.  The film is perhaps too long,
and there's a strange anti-climax when Norton's character professes his
love for Elfman's.  Nevertheless, it's very watchable, with Stiller
typically engaging and Elfman as cute as a button.  Norton is
underutilized, but that's probably due to the fact that he serves triple
duty on this film, as co-producer and director as well as one of the
principals--arguably, "Keeping the Faith" was not the best choice for
Norton's debut behind the camera since the young up-and-came-already actor
fails to impose any kind of unique stamp on the rather deliberate
screenplay.  What we have here is an extended episode of "Dharma and Ben
and Ed" with a religious bent.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

We all love Ben Stiller of "Something About Mary." And Ed Norton has
certainly become a well respected actor of recent time. (He's directing this
picture, by the way.) And who could resist the sexy tomboy Jenna Elfman
(Greg's Dharma)? But there's something about this reasonably funny film
"Keeping the Faith" that leaves a lingering doubt.
For sure the premise is devilishly sweet. Three best friends from childhood:
one becomes a priest (Norton), the other a rabbi (take a guess), the third
an aggressive high-powered business consultant (Elfman). Best buddies as
they worship the big guy, Norton and Stiller are altar-cowboys, inspiring
their respective New York congregations with refreshing zeal and silliness,
but not without a whole heart full of sincerity. This is where the film
radiates. Their friendship, confidence, love, and faith is expressed in a
wonderfully real, non-traditional, humorous, near-MTV, open/honest way. One
Santana-slick scene preaches this message without a spoken word: collar-clad
Norton and yarmulke-topped Stiller saunter down the streets of New York in
variable-slow-mo, donning leather jackets and dark sunglasses as they smile
and great passers-by. You'll love this sequence.
Enter Elfman. After having moved out of the neighborhood at age 13, the
alluring Elfman becomes hesitantly pursued by our two holy men - in a
lightly romantic-comedic, yet forbidden kind of way. This is where the doubt
slips in. The three are great performers, but there's an ever-so subtle
chemistry imbalance. The rapport between Norton and Stiller is so fresh and
exciting and honest - the film slides a baby step backwards in focusing on
Elfman and lover. The trio tangos for position, juggling dedication with
desire and comedy. Don't get me wrong, it's still entertaining ... it's just
that the meaty original story of the hip rabbi and priest simmers on the
back burner as the soapy love triangle bit occupies the screen. Norton's
character puts it aptly, "I feel like I'm in a Spelling TV series ...
'Melrose Priest.'"
Notable other points of remark: The opening five minutes is flatly lame (but
is over soon enough). Norton does a great Rainman impersonation. In smaller
roles, Milos Forman is awesome as elder confidant to Stiller, while Don the
Karaoke salesguy (Ken Leung) is over-the-top hilarious, stealing the screen
from the two top names in his brief appearance as he nails down one of the
films funniest, most memorable moments. I predict we'll see more of him in
the future.
Just a popcorn kernel short of an "A-", you won't have a bad time, but you
probably won't remember this film past Easter/Passover either.

     It truly is the oldest joke in the book: "A priest and a rabbi walk
into a bar..."  Okay, so you've heard this one.  Well now you can watch
the movie of the joke!
     Keeping the Faith may not be quite that bad, but it's nothing to,
ahem, preach about.  Setting the film up with all the trappings of your
classic, neurotic, New York relationship comedy, Faith wants to be a wry
When Harry Met Sally tale of opposites attracting and love conquering
all.  Oh, the opposites aren't the rabbi Jake (Ben Stiller) and the
priest Brian (Ed Norton) -- that might actually be a movie worth
watching.  The kink in this picture is Jenna Elfman's Anna, the old
childhood friend of Jake of Brian, who swishes into town and promptly
falls in love with our rabbi.
     While Keeping the Faith has some genuinely funny moments, you've
probably seen them all in the trailer.  The rest of the jokes often
involve someone falling down or otherwise injuring themselves.  The
exception to this rule is Ken Leung's bit part as a crooning karaoke
machine salesman (don't ask), who steals the show from the rest of the
players.
     Not that it's tough: what a dismal job these guys do with their
parts!  After proving herself to be genuinely dippy in bombs like
Krippendorf's Tribe and EdTV, Jenna "Dharma" Elfman as a high-test
corporate consultant stretches the boundaries of reality to the breaking
point.  Stiller is all right but uninspired, and Ed Norton seems like he
has cotton in his mouth for half the film, he mumbles his lines so
badly.
     Normally I'd blame the director for something like this, only... Ed
Norton is the director.  And judging by this, his debut performance
behind the camera, I think it's safe to say the phrase, "And the Oscar
for Best Director goes to Edward Norton!" is something we shall never,
ever hear.
     Thanks to a sappy script that runs more than two hours (and this is
a comedy!) and features a stroke, an ostracized son, and a
near-excommunication, Keeping the Faith is a clear example of a huge
collection of bad choices being paraded on the screen, one after
another.  But the worst sin of the film is its interminable blathering,
with characters droning on and on with no point, so much so that I just
stopped paying attention altogether.

It's always seemed to me that Edward Norton chooses his projects very
carefully since storming into the acting scene in 1996 with his Oscar
nominated performance in Primal Fear.  With every film after that
(Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders,
American History X, and Fight Club) he's come away with a major award
nomination or win of some kind.  All of those films have had something
about them that stood out... something that made them unique.  So I'm
perplexed as to why Norton would chose Keeping the Faith, a predictable
romantic comedy for the masses, as not only his next acting project but
also his first film as a director. 
Norton and Ben Stiller play a priest and a rabbi respectively, and the
two were best friends growing up.  They were also childhood friends with
Anna (Jenna Elfman).  When Anna comes to New York on business she
reunites with her two friends, who both are now obviously very attracted
to her.  What to do? 
As I sat and watched Keeping the Faith I was reminded constantly of Nora
Ephron's mediocre body of work and was surprised this was not a film
written or directed by her (although by film's end I understood why, as
Ephron is given "Special Thanks" during the film's closing credits). 
Most of the jokes in the film are clearly enhanced by the talents of the
people performing them, but there are several clichéd moments that even
the greatest comedic actors couldn't elevate past their "seen that
already" status.  Many moments in the first 30 minutes of the film
basically just involve Edward Norton falling down.  Also, later in the
film comes a scene seemingly inspired by Sister Act... a movie I do not
want to ever think about again. 
As I said, there are some funny moments in the film (some of which are
downright inspired), but there needed to be some major trimming done in
the editing room.  A romantic comedy does not need to run over two hours
unless there's some sort of amazing, twisty plot going on that needs as
much time as possible to completely play out.  "Priest wants girl but
can't have her because of his chosen profession and rabbi gets girl but
can't keep her for fear of alienating his congregation" isn't an epic
tale by any means. 
Besides Ephron, Norton also gives special thanks to director David
Fincher (there's one scene, a brief dream sequence, that I could see was
influenced by Fincher's work... and Seven is referenced early on as
well.)  I was surprised though not to see Michael Mann thanked, as
Norton seemed to take the Heat route with Keeping the Faith.  Scenes
will just linger on long after they have served their purpose, usually
to pan off to an establishing shot of a landmark of some sort.  Trim
that stuff down! 
Keeping the Faith is by no means a bad film or a failure for Norton as
either an actor or director.  Perhaps Norton chose this project because
it was a safe bet, as it's likely it will be moderately successful. 
Perhaps he will then use the film's success to make a movie that he
REALLY wants to make.  Time will tell.  [PG-13]

Bancroft, Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin
   The title character in Jeremy Pikser and Warren
Beatty's rollicking and prescient movie "Bulworth" believes
that we can solve the problem of racial tensions in America if
everyone would "mix it up" on the marriage bed (he put it in a
more vulgar and more effective way).  The folks who made
"Keeping the Faith" have a similar vision.  Although less
radical than Beatty in "Bulworth," "Keeping the Faith" director
Edward Norton forwards the agenda that superficial
differences among people be discarded like so much
confetti--littering the landscape today, gone tomorrow. 
In his amiable and consistently entertaining movie, the highly
diversified Mr. Norton--who is superlative in films as disparate
as "Fight Club," "Rounders," and "The People vs. Larry
Flynt"--now demonstrates his dexterity at the helm of a movie
that is as much a paean to harmony and happiness as
Woody Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You."  Filmed
appropriately in New York, this country's most diverse
metropolis, "Keeping the Faith" is about the friendship
between a priest and a rabbi that could make you
think of the long period of camaraderie between former New
York mayor Ed Koch and Cardinal O'Connor.  While Emanuel
Levy, writing for "Variety" magazine, calls this a date movie
for the 20 and 30 set, his view strikes discord with the
movie's own theme--that we should avoid labeling people
according to superficial attributes like race and religion and
presumably by age as well.  "Keeping the Faith" is a high-
spirited, feel-good film which avoids the sophomoric
predictability of more typically commercial feel-good fare such
as Adam Sandler's vehicle "The Waterboy."
   Recalling such films as James L. brooks's "Broadcast
News"--about a highly-charged woman who produces a TV
news program who is attracted to an anchorman quite
different from her in temperament--"Keeping the Faith" is a
buddy movie about a threesome who considered themselves
inseparable during their days in junior high school but whose
camaraderie ends when the female member splits for a
high-power job in San Francisco.  This leaves Jake (Ben
Stiller) and his pal Brian (Edward Norton) as a couple of guys
who continue their tight relationship--although
Jake becomes a rabbi and Brian a Catholic priest.   A visit to
New York by the third constituent, Anna (Jenna Elfman),
threatens not only the affinity of the two young men but the
foundation of Brian's very celibacy as a priest.  
   Written by Stuart Blumberg--who went to Yale with
Norton and whose friendship with him perhaps
parallels that between the movie's central characters--
"Keeping the Faith" is framed by a tale being told to a
bartender by an inebriated Father Brian Finn.  Brian goes
back to his days as a 12-year-old when he shares a happy
rapport with Anna and Jake.  The boys are heartbroken when
their pal moves cross country but perk up years later as Anna
calls Brian to tell him of her imminent trip to New York.  "Why
did she call you?" Jake wonders aloud, signalling to us the
envy might split their brotherhood.  As the three relate to one
another--Anna ultimately dating Jake while confessing her
innermost thoughts to Brian--we are treated to an often
hilarious, if familiar, series of takes involving pratfalls, verbal
wit, keen insights and moments of sweet tenderness.
   Those who follow movies centering on people of the Jewish
faith will be accustomed to the stock devices--the mother who
wonders when she will have grandchildren, the community
pushing daughters on their most eligible bachelor.  But given
the sometimes wide-eyed, sometimes rolling-eyed
expressions of Ben Stiller in Jake's role, we're treated to a
high level of entertainment that should be appreciated by
people of all denominations.  Though Stiller pretty much
carries the movie, we're cheered as well by Norton in the role
of the priest whose hormones are fighting with his sense of
duty and propriety.  Like Jake, Brian is a sympathetic figure,
one who resorts to popular tricks to build a congregation from
a trickle to a full house and whose comprehension of Spanish
affords him a good relationship with his mixed community.
   The casting of Jenna Elfman as the driven executive, so
addicted to connections that she has strapped a cell phone to
her thigh, is cogent. She is half a head taller
than Stiller but had been well-liked by the junior-high kids
because she was a tomboy--"one of them."  Side characters
are well-cast, including Eli Wallach as Jake's mentor and
especially Anne Bancroft as Jake's mom--a role that recalls
her performance in the upcoming movie by Philip Haas, "Up
at the Villa."  The movie has some vulgar excesses. Brian's
robes catch fire: he douses the flames by jumping into holy
water.  Jake faints at a bris.  An all-black gospel choir belts
out a stirring rendition of "Ain Kalohainu."  All of that comes
with the territory, and as sanctuaries for the faithful, the
church and the temple in "Keeping the Faith" are a hymn not
to separatism, but to glorious diversity.
