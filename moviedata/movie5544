There's a unique feeling of desperation intertwined with the events
that unfold in Wayne Wang's Chinese Box.  The film tells the story of a
man named John (Jeremy Irons) during the last few months of British
colonialism in Hong Kong.  John has lived in Hong Kong for fifteen
years, though he feels that he doesn't know his home at all.  He takes
pictures of the city, and writes about it, but nothing he says or feels
is certain or concrete.  The only thing he knows without doubt is that
he loves Vivian (Gong Li).  
Vivian, however, is an ex-prostitute who is associated with Chang
(Michael Hui); she wants to marry Chang and raise a family with him, but
his social standing ensures that he can not ever have such a
relationship with an ex-prostitute.  Vivian clearly has strong feelings
for John, but refuses to make them known to him.  Somewhere in the
middle of all this, John meets a woman named Jean (Maggie Cheung), who
dresses with eccentricity and seems to live a strange and vibrant
existence.  He tries to interview her, to find out about the scar that
covers half her face, but she's resistant at first.  Soon, a strange
parallel develops between his relationship with the two women.  
Wayne Wang has directed several other pictures, but the only one I've
seen is Smoke.  I didn't enjoy that film, but now that I can compare it
with Chinese Box, it is clear to me that Wang is not a one-trick film
maker.  There is so much to admire about Chinese Box, but I think the
most interesting aspect is Wang's consistent tone and atmosphere.  Every
scene is shot with a handheld camera, and this gives the film a jittery,
in-the-moment feeling.  It also keeps the film in John's perspective,
and this is a good decision because it keeps the setting foreign, and
even a little bit threatening.  The atmosphere is eerie and very
effective.
Wang's execution of his story (which was actually written by Larry
Gross and Jean-Claude Carriere) also helps to characterize the three
main people in his story.  John, played by Irons with that flustered
strength that Irons always manifests so effortlessly, is a
well-developed and interesting character, and a perfect type of person
to place at the center of this story.  Early in the film, he learns that
he has leukemia, and that he probably only has about six months to live,
and this puts a fascinating dimension onto his actions.
His associations with these two enigmatic women is really at the heart
of the story.  There are climactic scenes with both Vivian and Jean, and
both of these moments are perfectly created by Wang.  The best scene in
the film is towards the end, and it comes about when Vivian leaves Chang
to revert to her prostitute life; John finds her, and she puts on her
act for him, but he manages to break it down and prove to her that his
feelings are true.  This scene is perfect moviemaking, and is strong
mostly because of the acting.
Gong Li is a beautiful, talented actress, and is wonderful here in a
quiet, understated way.  Cheung's performance is entirely different, but
complex in that it's clear that she's hiding almost everything about
herself that's important to her.  The presence of these two interesting
female characters is one of the most prominent strengths of Chinese Box.
Wang does, however, make a couple of severe missteps that have
surprisingly strong negative effects on the film.  There is one scene
that completely disrupts the film's detached sense of frenzy -- it's a
series of shots in which John is in the hospital, learning that his
cancer is fatal, and then he goes outside and sits; during all of this,
horribly sentimental music twangs in the background (it's actually
performed by Ruben Blades, who plays John's friend Jim).  It changes the
tone of the film so abruptly that I was literally ripped from the
picture just at the moment when I wanted to be most absorbed in it.
Wang also seems uncertain about his reasoning for placing his story
against the backdrop of the disintegration of British colonialism in
Hong Kong.  It's something that he clearly feels strongly about, but
Chinese Box isn't long enough to focus on this fascinating love story
and still make a meaningful political statement.  Aside from these
elements, however, I can do nothing but enthusiastically recommend this
film -- Wang is a gifted film maker, and he has done a fantastic job of
creating a unique love story that draws you in and forces you to care.

     "There are moments [when you] see your life very clearly - things
left undone," John laments to himself over his long unconsummated love
affair with Vivian.  They've always known they wanted each other, but
they've let circumstances and spouses get in the way.  (In Vivian's
case it is not exactly a husband but rather a rich live-in lover named
Chang that she hopes to marry.)
     From the wonderful director of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and the more
recent SMOKE, Wayne Wang's new film, CHINESE BOX, is part romance and
part homage to Hong Kong.  His intentions are good, but the delicate
story, which he co-wrote, is never allowed to blossom.  And the
insubstantial script feels like it has "first draft" written all over
it.
     The story is set during the Hong Kong hand over from Great Britain
to mainland China.  Full of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, the
handsome cinematography by Vilko Filac suffers from excessive
pixilization during the long video tape sequences that cut into an
otherwise luscious picture.
     "Money, money, money - that's all you hear," John complains, which
is ironic considering he is the author of the old book, "How to Make
Money in Asia."  (He is shown scratching out the word "make" and
putting in "lose" in its place.)  A journalist now, John is played by
Jeremy Irons, who won the Oscar for best actor for his role in REVERSAL
OF FORTUNE.  John's got a rare form of leukemia and is expected to die
about the same time as the hand over - one of the movie's many
metaphors.
     Gong Li, who was so radiantly beautiful in SHANGHAI TRIAD and so
moving in one of my favorite films, TO LIVE, plays Vivian.  Vivian, who
escaped from the mainland, sees Chang as her future.  But since she is
an ex-prostitute ("hostess" to be more precise), he will live with her
but never marry her.  He "generously" arranges for them to be
photographed in wedding clothes, but that is his limit.
     The story's best scene has Vivian and John dancing close together
at a New Year's party.  Their tension is palpable as both are
uncomfortable about their unrequited love.  Vivian's eyes dart about
the room, unable to look directly at John.
     Maggie Cheung plays a con artist with a tragic background that
John becomes obsessed with interviewing.  Although Cheung's acting is
intriguing, her character serves only to confuse an already unfocused
narrative.
     Two people enter the picture only to immediately commit suicide in
order to remind us of the potential tragedy of the hand over.  But the
historical portion of the movie is given even shorter shrift than the
love story.
     Like John and Vivian's love affair, the movie generally leaves you
feeling unsatisfied.  I would have liked to know them better.  The
theme of two people who love each other deeply and who want to have an
affair but can't has promise, especially with such strong leads.
     CHINESE BOX runs 1:49.  It is rated R for language, brief nudity
and some sexual content and would be fine for teenagers.

Chinese Box (R) **
Comrades: Almost a Love Story ****
        Director Wayne Wang is understandably passionate about China's July 1,
1997 takeover of Hong Kong; having been born and raised there, and it is
not surprising that he chose to address the issue in a film.  But instead
of taking the predictable route and focusing on the politics of the
changeover, Wang, with the help of writers Jean-Claude Carriere, Larry
Gross, and Paul Theroux, decided to use the upheaval as the backdrop for a
love story.  Not a bad decision in theory, but definitely one in practice,
for the resulting film, the disappointing Chinese Box, is as cold and
uninteresting as a smaller HK-set romance currently in release, the modest
HK production Comrades: Almost a Love Story, is lively and touching.
        The obvious passion that Wang has for his homeland does not visibly extend
his two tortured lovers, John (Jeremy Irons) and Vivian (Gong Li).  John is
a terminally ill British journalist who has lived in Hong Kong for 15
years; former Mainlander Vivian is a bar owner trying to live down her past
as a prostitute.  John, who left behind a wife and children in England, is
deeply in love with Vivian, but her foolish hope that high-society
boyfriend Chang (Michael Hui) will marry her keeps them apart.  This should
be an involving triangle, but it never once engages the emotions, due in
large part to the ill-defined backstory between John and Vivian.  What
passes for insight comes in the form of a brief, dialogue-free, and
extremely vague flashback in which John, through a voiceover, says in so
many words that he and Vivian met in Shanghai, grew close, "should have"
become lovers but did not.  It is hard to develop a rooting interest in
their potential romance if there is never a clear idea of the bond they
supposedly share.
        Even more problematic is the character of Vivian--that is, if she even
qualifies as one.  The stunning Li is mainland China's premier actress, and
anyone familiar with her work in films such as Ju Dou know that her
exquisite beauty is more than matched by her formidable acting ability.
However, anyone seeing her for the first time in Chinese Box will come away
with a strong idea of the former but not the latter.  Since this film marks
Li's English-language debut, it is understandable that the filmmakers would
keep her English lines to a minimum.  But just how little dialogue she is
given is beyond ridiculous: "What?", "John," "Your problem, I fix it,"
"Bye," "Excuse me," and "Thank you" covers about half of her lines; her
dialogue in Chinese adds up to little more.  So for most of her screen
time, Li is called on to do little more than look gorgeous, with Vivian
coming off as more of an object than a flesh-and-blood person.
        If anything holds any audience interest in Chinese Box, it is the
supporting character of Jean, played by versatile Hong Kong superstar
Maggie Cheung.  Jean is a streetwise hustler whom John interviews for a
video account of colonial Hong Kong's final six months, attempting to put a
finger on the nation's "soul."  Jean is a fascinating character, whose
hardened exterior hides the deep emotional scars that match the one that
brands her face; she was abused by her father as a child, and she still
pines for the true love of her teen years, a Briton whose rejection of her
prompted a suicide attempt.  But much like the other threads in the film,
her storyline does not reach a satisfying resolution, and the conclusions
that Chinese Box does reach are simple and obvious.  I am not spoiling
anything when John comes to the ultimate realization that the elusive
"soul" of Hong Kong is not defined but constantly changing.
        Hong Kong's perpetual evolution is also used as the backdrop for a romance
in Peter Chan's 1996 decade-spanning masterpiece Comrades: Almost a Love
Story, which also stars Cheung and is currently rolling out across the
States on a city-by-city basis.  The comrades of the title are Qiao
(Cheung) and Xiaojun (Leon Lai), two native Mainlanders, who, as the film
begins, live in Hong Kong.  Their shared homeland is just about the only
thing the worldly wise Qiao and the naive Xiaojun have in common.  Xiaojun
maintains strong ties to China, in Hong Kong only to earn enough money to
marry his sweetheart back home while the ambitious Qiao hides her mainland
origins, working every minute of the day to achieve her dream of a wealthy
livelihood.  The two first meet in 1986 at a McDonald's, where she holds
down one of her numerous jobs.  Although her involvement with him should
end once she refers him to a language school (earning a commission, of
course), the two form an unlikely and often humorous friendship that leads
to love.  It's just that the two are much too proud to admit to it--even as
they spend more than one passionate night together.
        As the years pass, their chosen life paths take Qiao and Xiaojun in
opposite directions (literally and figuratively), but fate constantly
brings them back together, only to be pulled apart at every juncture by
conflicting dreams, love affairs, or both.  It sounds rather contrived, but
the stream of plot developments that Chan and screenwriter Ivy Ho devise
are entirely believable, which makes every reunion/breakup cycle all the
more heartbreaking.  The story's poignance is further elevated by the
electric chemistry between Lai and Cheung, whose work here won her the 1997
Hong Kong Film Award (one of the film's nine, including Best Picture and
Best Director) for Best Actress.  Lai is quite good, but Cheung is the real
marvel.  Her wonderfully expressive features are used to full effect by
Chan, whether to convey Qiao's spunky haughtiness at the beginning or her
eventual soul-aching longing (a simple, late-in-the-film gaze she casts
upon Xiaojun as he walks away from her car is particularly gut-wrenching).
        Both Chinese Box and Comrades: Almost a Love Story tell simple romances,
but their difference in effect can be attributed to the effort behind it.
The beauty of Comrades comes in how it does not try too hard; everything
about it feels natural and real.  On the other hand, Wang and company, as
much as they wanted to make a Hong Kong story, were obviously straining for
an idea; as such, what should have been the emotional hook of Chinese Box
is forced and unconvincing, rendering that talent-heavy film shockingly
impotent.  (Chinese Box opens April 3)

In English and Chinese with subtitles
     An educated concubine in feudal China (RAISE THE RED LANTERN).  A 
prostitute caught between two childhood friends during the 1940s 
(FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE).  A wife and mother facing tragedy in the 
aftermath of the Cultural Revolution (TO LIVE).  A sultry temptress in 
the heart of the '30s Shanghai gangland (SHANGHAI TRIAD).  These are 
some of the roles essayed by Chinese actress Gong Li, and they have one 
thing in common  all of them take place decades or even centuries ago.  
Even in THE STORY OF QUI JU, a contemporary tale, Gong's character comes 
from a remote village where the technology and customs are those of the 
past.  Not until CHINESE BOX has any director given Gong the role of a 
modern woman.  Considering how good she is as Vivian, a Hong Kong 
nightclub owner, one wonders why it has taken so long.  The actress is 
luminous in jeans and sunglasses, and, although she has trouble forming 
the unfamiliar English words that comprise much of her dialogue, she 
proves that she has the screen presence to play a character in any era.  
Sadly, CHINESE BOX is not the best forum for a display of her talent.
     This is the latest feature from Wayne Wang, the film maker who was 
behind the small, Brooklyn-based dramas, SMOKE and BLUE IN THE FACE.  
Instead of adapting the quirky tone that suffused those films, Wang has 
taken a 180-degree turn into melodrama for this examination of Hong Kong 
during the months and days preceding its transition from British to 
Chinese rule.  Given all of the tension and cultural upheaval generated 
by the events of July 1, 1997, this would seem to be an event capable of 
inspiring a great motion picture.  Unfortunately, Wang chooses to plunge 
viewers into a soap opera, a decision which robs CHINESE BOX of much of 
its potential power.
     Jeremy Irons, looking gaunt and unhappy, plays John, a British 
photojournalist who lives and works in Hong Kong, and who is suffering 
from unrequited love for Vivian.  With the approaching political 
changeover, John is feeling a deep sense of melancholy that is deepened 
when his doctor gives him some bad news.  The bulk of the film follows 
him as he makes one last, desperate play for Vivian.  However, his 
attempt to win her over is thwarted not only by the changing political 
tides, but by a series of dark secrets that emerge from both of their 
pasts.  A subplot of greater interest centers on John's endeavor to 
record the life story of Jean, a street hustler (Maggie Cheung).
     This is one of those films where the background elements are far 
more interesting than those in the foreground.  I didn't care much about 
what happened between John and Vivian, primarily because I never felt 
much for his character.  Irons is lifeless in this role, and his 
uninspired performance does little to draw us into John's world.  
Perhaps this individual is supposed to be a living metaphor for the 
rapidly-diminishing worldwide influence of the once-mighty British 
Empire, but symbols rarely make for interesting protagonists.  The most 
intriguing aspects of the movie are the political and economic 
implications of the changeover, but those are relegated to the 
background and shown primarily through CNN news clips.  Businessmen are 
nervous, but the only way we know this is through snatches of 
conversations that Wang allows us to overhear.
     Even though Gong is wonderful, I wish a lion's share of the time 
given to the sketchily-developed Vivian had been granted to Jean.  
Played by the wonderful Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung, who starred in 
IRMA VEP, Jean is lively and energetic  a welcome contrast to Irons.  
Her story, which we learn in bits and pieces, might have made for a 
better motion picture than the one Wang assembled.  Instead of getting 
the full narrative, however, we are fed the short version in a series of 
interludes sandwiched between the cliched development of the tortured 
romance between John and Vivian.
     It's doubtful that CHINESE BOX will be the last fictional effort to 
be fashioned from the events surrounding July 1, 1997 in Hong Kong.  
However, it's questionable whether any other motion picture will have 
such a top-notch level of talent in front of and behind the cameras.  
CHINESE BOX is not a terrible film  it offers a series of semi-
satisfying moments for those who crave a sudsy romantic tragedy  but it 
is a disappointment.  The real puzzle of this CHINESE BOX is how so much 
dramatic potential could result in a film of so little consequence.

There are probably a lot of metaphors and symbolism that I just flat out
missed when I saw Chinese Box. It could have something to do with seeing
it at 9:00 AM with only 3 hours sleep, or it could just be the subject
matter which I am admittedly not an expert on.
The film is set in Hong Kong during the days between New Year's Eve 1996
(the last under British control) and July 1, 1997 (when China reclaimed
the province). Sounds exciting so far, right? Throw in a tiresome
romance that goes ultimately unresolved and you've got yourself two
hours of pure unadulterated fun.
Jeremy Irons plays John, a sickly Brit author transplanted in Hong Kong
for the last fifteen years. He's left his wife and kid back home,
presumably to pursue the love of his life, Vivian (Gong Li, Farewell My
Concubine). Vivian, a former hooker and John's ex, owns a successful
karaoke bar but wants only to marry her wealthy politician boyfriend,
Chang (Michael Hui), in order to distance herself from a dirty slutty
past. The trouble is that there is absolutely no emotional spark between
John and Vivian, and that is a fact that made me very sleepy.
The saving grace of Chinese Box comes from Maggie Cheung (Supercop), who
plays a street-wise con artist named Jean. John meets her while filming
a monotonous video diary of how  the impending hand-over will effect
citizens of different social pedigree. Jumpy Jean immediately intrigues
John, who squanders his days away trying to find out what makes her
tick.
What these two stories have to do with each other is beyond me. I guess
that I understand the basic comparison of the uncertainty of the three
main characters with the real life inhabitants of the province, but
that's a pretty weak plot. Perhaps viewers more intimate with the
subject matter may find it more passionate.
I'm not even sure if director Wayne Wang found that passion in his
finished product. Wang's previous efforts seem much more emotional to
me, especially The Joy Luck Club and, one of my secret guilty pleasures,
Slamdance. Don't laugh.
And what's the deal with Jeremy Irons career? If he's not playing a
terminally ill character (Stealing Beauty), he's in some big budget
piece of crap (Die Hard with a Vengeance and the reprehensible The Man
in the Iron Mask) or worse yet, the voice of a cartoon character (The
Lion King). Gong Li, who is widely regarded as the most beautiful woman
on the planet, is under used in her first English speaking role. Her
lines are limited and usually monosyllabic. And it is very strange to
see her wearing blue jeans. Cheung and Ruben Blades (The Devil's Own)
shine in their supporting roles.
To summarize, Chinese Box was about as exciting as the actual Hong Kong
hand-over. It was a lot more efficient as a three-minute sound bite
delivered by Peter Jennings.

   Whatever the virtues of lack of same in Wayne Wang's
movie, "Chinese Box," the film is valuable because like
Haskell Wexler's "Medium Cool," the drama is told against a
background of a turning point in history.  Wexler's film, which
featured the newly-discovered Robert Foster, portrays a TV
cameraman who is detached although surrounded by events
demanding his involvement, and uses real footage of his
actors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.  Wang's
current movie is a tale of an increasingly resigned British
journalist-photographer whose final months in Hong Kong are
played out against a background of the island's imminent
takeover by the government of Mainland China during the first
half of 1997.
   Wang is for the most part as laid-back in his direction of
this seemingly improvised piece as he was at the helm of his
more accessible (to Americans) "Smoke" and "Blue in the
Face," both humorous character studies of typical denizens of
Brooklyn and parts of Manhattan.  (Educated in British and
American schools, the director's fondness for things American
is no secret: he is, in fact, named after John Wayne.)  The
freewheeling director's current effort is not particularly
noteworthy for incisive dialogue but more notable in its
evocation of the atmosphere of one of the world's great tourist
destinations which, for the time being, is being governed with
a hands-off attitude by the Chinese government.  The major
flaw in "Chinese Box" is its heavyhanded manipulation of
metaphors, not just in some of the expressions tossed about
such as comparing Hong Kong to "Pompeii before Vesuvius,"
a "department store under new management," and "a whore
who must become accustomed to a new pimp," but principally
in its use of one female character who, presumably like the
city, is scarred on the outside but reckless beneath the
surface.
   If one line defines the drama, it's a humorous one tossed
off by a gypsy-like journalist, Jim (Ruben Blades), who is
temporarily sharing the flat of his photojournalist friend, John
(Jeremy Irons).  Offered a bottle of cheap wine which Jim
defines as "Chateau Hong Kong 1997," John replies, "It was a
good year...no doubt about it."  The irony of the remark is
palpable.  1997 is the year of uncertainty and anxiety.  The
British, ruling the place for a century and half, are scheduled
to leave on July 1, the future of the foreign journalists is
uncertain, and worst of all, the leukemia-afflicted John is not
expected to survive to see another year.  For the past year
John has been in love with Vivian (Gong Li), once a high-
class prostitute who is involved with prosperous businessman
Chang (Michael Hui).  Vivian wants to marry Chang but is
rebuffed because the Chinese culture looks askance at
women with her background.  John is able to enjoy Vivian
from time to time, however, as the beautiful former "hostess"
seeks him out each time her boyfriend puts her off.
   A second story features John's relationship with Jean
(Maggie Cheung), a street woman who makes her living
hawking fake Rolexes and, symbolically, a can containing "the
last breath of colonial air."  Fascinated by her interesting
albeit heavily scarred face and her impulsive, tension-filled
bearing, he pays her for a videotaped interview but learns
through old newspaper clippings that she is hiding one key
detail.  When she was sixteen, she fell in love with a young
Briton, was forbidden by her father from seeing him, and
attempted suicide.
   Each time the loosely constructed story seems to have no
place to go, Wang's regular cinematographer, Emir Kusturica,
runs his hand-held camera to the outside world. We see
glimpses of both the prosperity and the poverty of the island,
fishing boats competing with glass skyscrapers for our
attention, as people go about their jobs slaughtering chickens,
cutting up fish, hawking food in the marketplace or enjoying
the sensual dances of women in upscale night clubs. 
Kusturica includes some precious shots of the departure of
the British, some with tears in their eyes, and the arrival in
tanks of thousands of young soldiers from the mainland to the
cheers of hordes of citizens.  (In two cases dissenters show
their disapproval of the change of government; one by
shooting himself in the presence of New Year's Eve revelers
in a classy club, the other by torching himself on the street.)
   The principal chemistry in the movie is, unfortunately, not
between Irons and Li, both of whom seem to be holding
themselves back as though unable to transcend their cultural
differences, but between Irons and his guitar-playing
roommate, Jim.  Ruben Blades provides the needed comic
moments in this meandering tale whose principal value is not
as a romance or as a study of a dying man's attempt to
express his love, but as a docu-drama recording the changing
of the guard over what is perhaps the world's most capitalistic
enclave.  The outdoor sequences might have come from the
pen of Paul Theroux, one of the scripters and America's most
notable travel writer.  While "Chinese Box" is far better than
Wang's only failure, "Slam Dance," it does not rise to the
heights of his best work, "Dim Sum," a delicate reflection on
family values filmed in San Francisco. Not Rated.  Running
time: 109 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten

Written by: Jean-Claude Carriere and Larry Gross.
Starring: Jeremy Irons, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung, Ruben Blades
Ingredients: Dying photojournalist, 1997 Hong Kong hand over, street
waif, friend, lover
Synopsis: 
John, a British author who has adopted Hong Kong as his home, suddenly
finds out he is dying of leukemia six months before the hand over of
Hong Kong to China. He quits his job and tries to explore the meaning of
Hong Kong by wandering the streets with a video camera. Since John is a
character of internal feelings and few words, John's roommate Jim (Ruben
Blades) occasionally acts as the movie's mouthpiece.
What is Hong Kong before the hand over? Is Hong Kong like John's lover
Vivian (Gong Li), a Chinese woman who hangs on to him knowing he will
die? Is Hong Kong like the scrappy street waif Jean (Maggie Cheung),
cast off by a former boyfriend, who hustles to survive? Is it like a
business, merely getting a change of management? Or like a defiant
animal in the marketplace? A woman in blue jeans vowing to start life
anew? 
CHINESE BOX explores these metaphorical images and more, and leaves the
answer unresolved, letting us come to our own conclusions. The only
thing we know for sure is that a tumultuous change is occurring before
our eyes, accompanied by an intensity of feeling similar to time spent
with a dying lover. 
Opinion:
When Vivian compares herself to Hong Kong and the dying John (Jeremy
Irons) wonders to himself, "I wonder if I can last as long as  the
British" six months before the 1997 hand over, you can bet this film is
not about leukemia, but a metaphor trying to establish the meaning of
Hong Kong. 
One of the weaknesses of the story is that it has very little story.
After quitting his job a dying John basically wanders around the city
with his video camera capturing images and occasionally falling into
weakness or frustration. His thoughts remain confused until the end of
the movie. This is likely to disappoint fans of strong storylines. 
On the other hand, CHINESE BOX is powerful from the artistic point of
view.  In one scene, John's friend Jim takes a projector, and projects
the videotaped face of the talking street waif onto John's face,
creating an interesting effect. From images of jade and bloody hands to
a man beheading a chicken, to a scene where the street waif confronts a
British childhood boyfriend who abandoned her, CHINESE BOX offers us an
unending stream of metaphors for the complicated feelings that abound in
real life Hong Kong. Perhaps the strongest image (shown twice) is the
close up of the still-beating heart on a faceless chopped fish in the
marketplace. CHINESE BOX is also one of the few films in which the
soundtrack completely and perfectly matches the imagery, whether it's
the sound of traffic or the sound of silence. 
Gong Li doesn't get many lines, (mostly gets to show emotions) but she
does a fabulous job within that limitation. Ruben Blades and Maggie
Cheung are outstanding, and Jeremy Irons puts in a solid
characterization of a man trying to come to grips with complicated
feelings.

Wayne Wang's most recent feature, "Chinese Box," is best described as an
intriguing mess: several strong performances amid some interesting themes
don't quite manage to form a coherent whole. It's somewhat frustrating to
watching because the film feels like it could have been much better.
Still, there's plenty to enjoy as it is.
With the handover of Hong Kong to China in mid-1997 impending, Jeremy
Irons, as a British writer/journalist named John, learns he is dying of
leukemia--in fact, dying at a rate that means he'll disappear from the
scene at about the same time the British will. The obvious allegory is,
unfortunately, not as well developed as it might be; at least, much of the
plot doesn't seem to support the allegory in any intelligible way. The
film follows his relationships with two Chinese women--Gong Li's
prostitute-turned-nightclub-owner Vivian, and Maggie Cheung's feisty
street hustler Jean. Oddly, though, the stories of the three individuals
are arguably more compelling than the relationships between them: Vivian,
though she has made her way out of prostitution, is nonetheless barred by
her past from marrying her businessman lover, and must resort to sending
home fake wedding pictures. Jean hawks pirated videos and pines for her
British boyfriend--yet, when he surfaces and acknowledges that he has
forgotten her completely, she shrugs it off after a moment and goes back
to work. And John, onetime writer of a tome called "How to Make Money in
Asia," is forced by his illness to see the reality of Hong Kong, even as
he fades away from it. His unrequited love for Vivian never seems fully
realized, since the two characters don't get to interact much until the
end of the film--and, oddly, John's scenes with Jean have more life.
Irons, as usual, fills out his part nicely; he makes the audience believe
in his illness, seemingly becoming paler and more gaunt over the course of
the story, and, like the British presence, increasingly muted and
insubstantial. (Hmmm. Maybe that allegory worked after all.) Cheung,
erstwhile action-movie star, is a burst of energy in a sometimes languid
film; more self-possessed and more savvy than the other two leads, she is
the only one who seems to have a clear direction. Li's icy aloofness will
be familiar to those who know her from past efforts, mostly under the
direction of Zhang Yimou: "Raise the Red Lantern," "Ju Dou," "To Live,"
and "Shanghai Triad," as well as "Farewell My Concubine" and "Temptress
Moon", saw her refining her imperious air. But this is the first role
speaking mostly in English, and at times she struggles to make herself
understood (though at other times she comes through with what sounds
almost like an American twang). (One scene where she tries to imitate
Marlene Dietrich's voice has something of a self-referential quality.) And
it's difficult for the audience to connect with her character, since the
film is played mostly through Irons's eyes and Irons doesn't really
understand her himself. Still, Li has a subtly expressive face that makes
her enjoyable to watch, even though enigmatic.
Wang's quasi-documentary style does not serve him well here. Much of the
dialogue was drowned out by background noise; Li's lines in particular,
which would have been difficult to understand in the best of
circumstances, take some repeat listening to decipher. The shaky-camera
technique, though it imparts an air of realism, becomes tired and
distracting after a while. Though there are moments when the handheld
camera works well--following Cheung down an alley, for example--it more
often calls attention away from the lead actors and onto the director.
Aside from a few moments at the beginning and the end, moreover, the
political element hardly makes it into the film, which is unfortunate
because the documentaryish angle might have served Wang well there.
Instead, the love story becomes the bulk of the plot--and considering how
little development that story receives, the film sometimes slows almost to
a halt. With lesser actors than these three, it could have been rather
wearying.
There are things to enjoy about "Chinese Box," but the movie as a whole
needs some work. If you're a Gong Li or Jeremy Irons fan, give it a shot.

Something Missing from "Chinese Box" 
Set during the last few months of colonial rule in Hong Kong, just prior
to her return to mainland China, "Chinese Box" is an intriguing film
that tries to encapsulate the mood of Hong Kong as symbolized through
its three main characters.  We meet up with John (Jeremy Irons) who is a
foreign journalist that has been living in Hong Kong for the last 15
years.  The world as he knows it is changing perilously fast.  Like the
British rule that is about to come to an end, John discovers that he has
an advanced form of leukemia and that he only has a few months to live.
"I wonder if I'll last longer than the British," he says of his
situation.  
John, despite having a family, has always carried a torch for the
beautiful Vivian (Gong Li), who is a karaoke bar manager and former,
high-priced club girl from mainland China.  Vivian is now in a
relationship with wealthy businessman Chang.  She longs for marriage and
family, but because of her less-than-honorable background, she
eventually realizes that a future for them is all but impossible.  Like
the tie between the mainland and Hong Kong, it is an uneasy relationship
fraught with innuendo, questions, and ambiguity.  
With only a short time to live, John would like to find a way to win
Vivian's heart again.  But he doesn't want to spend the rest of his
precious time just chasing her.  He also decides to take his video
camera wherever he goes so that he can document the city and her
secrets.  One such discovery is Jeanne (Maggie Cheung), who is a
resourceful peddler.  She tells her life story to John after being
offered money for an interview, and reveals how an English schoolmate
broke her heart which resulted in her trying to commit suicide.  Her
facial scars symbolize the torture of British influence.  But her
spirits are fiery as a result.  Later on in the film, John reacquaints
Jeanne with her long, lost love, but the now-young British man doesn't
even recognize her.  She weeps momentarily, but then soon begins to
peddle her wares with more determination.  This is a stately and poetic
scene that gives a glimpse into Hong Kong's fragility.
There is an underlying elegance to this film and its setting is innately
interesting.  In many scenes, we eavesdrop into conversations and listen
to the banter of the businessmen that speak of opportunities in the new
era.  Other parts of the film are seen through John's video camera.
John's need to record everything on video speaks to his desire to
preserve a Hong Kong that he has grown to love.   Yet, at other times,
watching can become a distracting experience.  Sometimes, it seems as if
the shooting is rushed.  Although the movie was shot during Hong Kong's
period of reversion to capture the frenetic atmosphere, the picture is
sometimes shaky as if the cameraman is struggling to keep up with all
that is swirling around him.
It also never quite reaches the dramatic heights that it seems capable
of given the rich atmosphere, time period, and beautifully envisioned
characters.  I couldn't quite embrace the reason why John pined for
Vivian.  Also, Vivian was by far the most complex character and her
desire and struggle for acceptance was intriguing, but her story is
largely left unexplored and we are left with annoying question marks in
our heads because we want to know what she will do next given her
resourceful nature.  Gong Li possesses an understated eloquence, but
seemed painfully underused.   Overall, I was fascinated by the
undertones marked by the impending changeover and was receptive to the
idea of opportunities that can arise from starting anew.   But there
seems to be so much more going on than what we could see on the screen.
Ambitious but ultimately unfulfilling, I wished that "Chinese Box" would
have revealed more.
