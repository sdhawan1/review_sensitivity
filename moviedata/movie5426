JESUS' SON (director: Alison Maclean; screenwriters: Denis Johnson
novel/Elizabeth Cuthrell/Oren Moverman /David Urrutia; cinematographer:

(Dr. Shanis),  Michael Shannon (Dundun), John Ventimiglia (McInnes),
Jack Black (Georgie); Runtime: 109; 1999)
This might be the best junkie film ever made. It is set in Iowa in the
1970s and follows the observations of a young screw up, who gets the
ignominious nickname of Fuckhead (Billy Crudup), a name which he comes
to accept as it sticks with him. The New Zealander, Alison Maclean
(Crush), directed Denis Johnson's book of short dramatic stories with a
sharp eye for comedy, where the addiction story plays second fiddle to
the overall psychological problems of the addict.
The film has its protagonist go from one adventure to another as he
tries to make sense of his messed up life, in each episode he meets up
with different offbeat characters and continues to find himself lost in
this dark world of his own stupidity, where he goes from a morbid
dreamer, to a drug addict and thief, and finally to a savior. Billy
Crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of
the author, making the internal musings of Denis Johnson's disjointed
surreal stories come to life, not quite like in the book, but in its own
cinematic way. That this impossible book was adapted to the screen, is a
minor miracle itself, though it is certainly not a fault-free film, as
it petered out toward the end from sluggishness. But if viewed as a
story that doesn't have to make too much sense, because a junky' life
doesn't make too much sense anyway, then the film can be savored for its
fair quota of highs. This film easily takes in scenes with characters
who leave the film just as quickly as they entered it, with the only
constant in the story being Crudup, who keeps everything in order by his
continuous voiceover. The film is divided into chapter headings, which
are flashed onscreen, as FH rants on like the stoned out freak he is.
This episodic adventure of the irresponsible FH, who is lost and
undisciplined, begins on the rainy highway where he is hitching a ride
to see if he can get back together with Michelle (Samantha Morton). The
story goes into the flashback mode as FH tells what happened to him
three years ago in the early 1970s and how he met the love of his life,
the frizzled haired Michelle, who looks sexy walking around in her
bikini panties. She is a heroin addict he meets when a guy who fell
asleep in his VW takes him to a house party. The only problem he has, is
that she is seeing another guy named McInnes (Ventimiglia). He is the
one who gives FH his illustrious name, as he sees him kissing his girl
at the party. But soon Dundun (Shannon) shoots McInnes in the stomach
and he dies before the reluctant Dundun is talked into getting him to
the hospital. Dundun gets FH's help to dump the body in a cornfield.
Michelle's relationship with the innocent but not-so-innocent FH becomes
a live-in one, where we watch the couple casually shoot heroin,
something she gets him started in, while the TV plays cartoons in the
background. FH is totally oblivious to things around him, serenely
eating Frosted Flakes, as he is too self-absorbed to know what he is
doing or where he is at.
One of the more hysterical scenes, is when he converses with his morose
cowboy friend Wayne (Leary) in a bar, and Wayne takes him to salvage his
abandoned home for scrap wires and plumbing fixtures, as they get enough
money to score some heroin and return to the bar and get loaded. There
might be some unintentional moral to the story at this point, as they
both take the heroin but Wayne keels over dead from it.
The funniest chapter from the book, is the scene where he is working as
an orderly in the hospital's emergency room. His partner orderly is the
zany Georgie (Jack Black), who robs the dispensary of all kinds of
pills, which they both pop to help them get through the long night. The
comedy becomes "Pulp Fiction"-like when the two of them treat a man who
comes in with a knife stuck in his eye socket, and then go for a car
ride to unwind in the snowy winter night, as they decide to camp out in
the wilderness and live off the land.
The most dramatic scene comes when Michelle is pregnant and he takes her
to a Chicago abortion clinic, which has pro-life demonstrators in front
of the clinic. The two fight over nothing and their blankness to life
gets the better of them, as they part company. She soon goes to Mexico
with an unappealing man called John Smith.
The film returns from the flashback mode at this point and we see him
hitchhike to Michelle's new place, where the two of them try to get back
together, which will have disastrous results. FH then ends up alone in
Arizona to kick his addiction problems. Here -- FH becomes involved with
many things; such as, staring through the window of a Menonite
housewife's home because he is enchanted by her spiritual singing;
having an absurd conversation with a fellow patient (Dennis Hopper) who
has a few bullet holes in him, as they reside in a rehab clinic; having
a sexual relationship with a hard luck member of his support group
(Holly Hunter), whose three husbands died.
FH finds his salvation when he ends up working in a nursing home as an
editor for a newspaper about the residence, who are disturbed and
disabled patients. Here, he learns how to touch these patients, who are
even more messed up in life than he is because of their infirmaries. He
drily says that the God who created this mess must be some madman.
"Jesus' Son," a title snatched from a Lou Reed song, has many glorious
moments of dry humor, pungency, sadness and unpredictability; it
exhibits the rare quality all special films have, it requires some
effort to see what the film is about, and though it is a likable film,
it does not aim to please its audience. It is a film that zig-zags all
over the map, with its target being pop culture in America and how one
survivor of the drug culture, who is so disarming and real, will have
his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and
give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious
experience.

Excellent dialogue, direction, and acting injected into a rather bland film.
The main character (Billy Crudup) is high on pills for most of this two-hour
presentation. Appropriately, the story is told in tangents and a somewhat
jostled sequence.
If you don't enjoy being around real people when they're high, you'll
probably not enjoy spending nearly two hours with someone acting that way (I
didn't). But that's me, plus there are folks who enjoy "drug movies" (as a
friend of mine called this one), so perhaps you'll find more to enjoy here
than I.
Still, I'm a huge fan of the little star Billy Crudup. He handles this role
with apathetic perfection.
If this review hasn't scared you away yet, expect a slowly paced film.
Gentle, yet harshly realistic. So realistic it's at times boring. The focus
is entirely on Crudup as he retells the meeting of a girl that seems to have
meant a lot to him. But, their 1970's love affair is so drug-ridden that I
just couldn't share his enthusiasm for her.
Up until near the end, Crudup stumbles through his own life with a sort of
disconnection to the small deaths within himself and the real ones around
him. The last twenty minutes don't change pace, just perception.
Perhaps a good film to enlighten with a strong dose of simulated reality
those innocents who find the drug culture glamorous.
The title is burrowed from the song "Heroin" by Lou Reed, "When I put a
spike into my vein, and I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same, when I'm
rushing on my run and I feel just like Jesus' son."

(Note: This review originally appeared  on REELING in early June prior to its 
theatrical release)
As the month of June closes I can't help but look back on all the shitty, 
joyless, but damn expensive Summer flicks I've endured; the kinetic 
showboating of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, the empty headed Toyota commercial 
visuals of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, the boring platitudes coupled with jerky 
action and BRAVEHEART's plot in GLADIATOR, the non-stop gross out desperation 
of ROAD TRIP, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon drawings of TITAN A.E. They 
all looked fantastic and seemed to hold a wealth of possible treasures, you 
know, the Saturday Matinee thrill of adventure with maybe some good 
characterization thrown in, but no, they pandered and failed to even elicit 
the cheesy thrills of past summer crapola like DEEP BLUE SEA or THE 
FRIGHTENERS.
So I return, my childlike hopes squashed, to the ol' reliable art house. I 
don my spectacles, attempt to procure a three-day growth of beard and I 
enter, tail naturally between those legs of mine, one of my old theatre 
haunts. Pleasant memories waft my way-- the friendly security guard babbling 
about Fellini films, the male ticket ripper with the eye-liner and the 
RESERVOIR DOG's T-shirt, ahhh yes a world as full of magical incongruities as 
a Fellini film. You see in the early to mid nineties the art houses have been 
my refuge from the Hollywood crap that pollutes cities across this fair 
nation. I remember the hipster urgency of RESERVOIR DOGS, the sad\funny paces 
of TREES LOUNGE, the love of life found in BIG NIGHT, but that was long ago. 
I've been disappointed by these as well; most recently my trips to the art 
houses have been less fruitful; PECKER was John Waters homogenized (and he 
was the one doing the homogenizing, no lose), THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
was a choir to sit through, DESERT BLUE felt like a lame WB special complete 
with Kevin Williamson style quirks, and on. Most indie films are now just as 
manufactured as the mainstream ones.
Those "fringe" movies have spawned into their own little market full of 
flicks with their own brand of high concepts; the casual drug use, coolly 
unshaven men with tussled hair pontificating like philosophy scholars, hip 
white boys who use the "n" word like it's the ultimate badge of rebel cool, 
and the requisite Janeane Garafalo appearance. It's become just as tough to 
make a personal statement in that kind of arena so now previous indie film 
makers like Todd Solonz, David O Russell and Neil La Blute have migrated to 
major film, which is a good thing. It's about time for a shift.
JESUS' SON is chock full of the elements of indie films I've grown to 
loathe. It has the grungy-chic hand held photography, the medium close-ups of 
junkies shooting up, the quirky supporting characters, and it's a bit of an 
episodic, shambling mess vacillating wildly from one tone to another. But it 
has a certain lackadaisical charm, a bit of free wheeling gusto that those 
mapped out, formulaic big budget summer movies lack. Its actors and 
screenplay overcome the occasional handicaps, and maybe I would have given it 
an even higher grade had I not been so put off by its essential ingredients. 
(One can only sit through so many hiply off center philosophical junkie 
flicksâŚ). But it coasts on a sort of sedated charm that leaked through the 
screen and gently tap-danced on me. I felt like I was viewing something 
genuine, something with a distinct feel and voice and even some insight into 
its low lifes. This movie is at least alive while, nowadays, most indies come 
at us DOA.
Billy Crudup stars as F*ck Head (a nickname that stuck after he seemed to go 
out of his way to keep it) a passive drifter who lets life carry him 
wherever. He's a follower who stumbles into the junkie lifestyle after 
developing a dysfunctional relationship with a Michelle (Samantha Morton), a 
petulant junkie. He's a bit of a flaky idiot but a damn likeable one the way 
Crudup plays him. The actor gives FH a sort of off kilter John Cusack on 
smack vibe (the character could be the directionless Lloyd Dobler of SAY 
ANYTHING after being dumped by the Ione Skye character). He's charming in an 
enigmatic way with mannerisms that seem ever so slightly off. Crudup's an 
attractive actor (like a cross between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at their 
scruffiest) and for him to play this kind of loser with the same lived in 
baggage he gave heartthrob track star Prefontaine in WITHOUT LIMITS (the 
better of the two bio-pics of "the James Dean of track") marks him as not 
only a major talent but a very capable leading man just waiting to hit the 
mainstream.
FH wanders through several low down adventures, most unrelated, with a 
narrative that could kindly be called non-existent. The film is like a series 
of SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL shorts strung together, all featuring the same 
character and his progressions (or digressions). Each short has a guest star 
who most likely won't be seen in the next one. Dennis Leary, for once 
abandoning his rat-tat-tat delivery for subtle characterization, is one of 
those appearing briefly as a stoic drunk who tears apart his old home in 
order to sell the copper for money. Jack Black (HIGH FIDELITY) appears in the 
film's most amusing "short", as a hospital orderly who acts like a kid in a 
candy store. He has what may be the funniest scene I've seen all year; a bit 
involving mind-altering drugs, and incompetent staff and an impaled patient 
is like Preston Sturges meets Tarantino and all that implies. Dennis Hopper 
is sharper than usual as a craggy old drunk who got shot twice, by his two 
different wives and Holly Hunter acts exactly like Holly Hunter.
Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN, in which she was nominated for an Academy 
Award) appears in several of the shorts as the woman who loves and 
manipulates Fuck Head. Her child-like sweetness is matched with a world-weary 
quality that seems to be taking over. Their relationship is a passive 
aggressive one with the Morton character largely in control.
JESUS SON may be annoying to some for it's a film that's all ebb and flow, 
excitement and boredom. The film doesn't really end so much as run out gas 
which I suppose is appropriate considering the character's journey; if it had 
ended differently with some overly dramatic conclusion I'd probably be 
bemoaning it, though it seems that JESUS' SON overstays its welcome just a 
bit with its last twenty minutes seeming largely redundant, sort of like how 
it might be to watch Benjamin and Elaine from THE GRADUATE after they realize 
how wrong they are for each other (that had to be a real long bus ride) and 
begin getting on each other's nerves, eventually splitting up and returning 
to their old lives.
JESUS SON isn't a great film but in a time where indies seem to be dying a 
slow boring death, it's an appropriate return to what independent film should 
be doing. And after a month of wadding through high concept Hollywood crap 
it's just what I needed to get excited about the movies again.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Would you get into a car that you knew was going to be in a horrific
accident?  Unless you're a character from David Cronenberg's Crash, the
answer is probably no.  But in Jesus' Son, FH has no problem making this
decision.  Hitchhiking, he accepts a ride from a nice family in an
Oldsmobile, waits for the crash and, afterwards, hangs around at the
hospital long enough to hear the mother's sickening screams.
FH (Billy Crudup, Without Limits) obviously isn't your ordinary guy.
His name, an abbreviation for `F--- Head', was given to him because he
constantly screws things up, especially when he tries to help people.
But who is FH?  Is he an angel?  Is he really Jesus' son, or did he just
listen to Velvet Underground's Heroin too many times?  Perhaps he's just
a delusional junkie.  FH says that he knows everything before it happens
and even knows the names of each raindrop.  But it's hard to tell if he
can really peer into the future, or if the drugs are making him think he
can.
Jesus' Son follows the adventures of FH during his
drug-and-alcohol-hazed travels throughout the 70s.  Beginning in Iowa
City and culminating in an Arizona nursing home, FH staggers throughout
the country searching for everything, yet, at the same time, nothing in
particular.  He meets strange people, finds strange lines of work, and
continually crosses paths with a woman named Michelle (Samantha Morton,
Sweet & Lowdown) that FH feels is his soulmate.  The couple often gets
together for weekends of sex and drugs that dissolve into screaming
fights.
The surreal film seems to lack a cohesive plot, partially due to the
fact that it's based on a collection of short stories written by Denis
Johnson.  I'm not sure if the tales in Johnson's book are as unrelated
as they appear here (it was adapted by three novice screenwriters), but
the film isn't really presented in a way that emphasizes separate
stories, resulting in a jumble of characters that you expect to jump
back into the story but never do.  There are only three constants  FH,
Michelle and the drugs.
Eerily resembling Kurt Cobain in both appearance and lethargic demeanor,
Crudup delivers a fine follow-up to his underrated turn as Steve
Prefontaine in last year's widely overlooked film Without Limits.  His
FH, who also narrates the movie, has eyes that look haunted and lost,
yet totally aware and ominiscient, which almost convinces you that he
does have some type of special healing power.  But like any decent film
that revolves around drug use (Drugstore Cowboy, Rush), it's hard to
decipher what's real as FH's hallucinations blend seamlessly into
reality.  Hell, one time I hit my thumb with a hammer so hard that I
thought I saw a leprechaun.
Directed by Alison Maclean (Crush), Jesus' Son offers a ton of great
70s songs and some fine supporting roles (namely Denis Leary, Holly
Hunter, Will Patton and Jack Black).  But the finest part of the film is
perhaps the utterly believable appearance of FH and Michelle.  These two
are simply disgusting.  The only time either of them got anywhere near
soap is when FH nearly overdosed and Michelle dragged him into a cold
shower hoping to revive him.  You could almost smell the stench of body
odor in the theater (or maybe it was that guy next to me).

Harvey S. Karten
   People who dug Mary Harron's movie "American Psycho"
may have enjoyed the witty take on violence or 
the satiric edge by which the story condemned the rampant
yuppie materialism of the 1980s.  Some of us who lived
through the seventies and eighties look nostalgically at the
unique era of the early 1970s when not moneyk, but hippies,
love and hallucinogenic drugs were the fashion of the times. 
We forget the suffering and waste of that interval, the drug-
induced pain that led to the downfall of the epoch of peace
and love.  Alison Maclean remembers, as does Denis
Johnson who wrote the best-selling episodic novel from which
the movie "Jesus' Son" is adapted.  
   "Jesus' Son" is about losers.  The story hones in on one
particular screw-up who earned the nickname FH from those
who came into contact with him.  As FH, the roguishly
handsome Billy Crudup--last seen with the dazzling Jennifer
Connelly in the critically mixed "Waking the Dead"--
dominates every scene of this metaphoric and literal road trip
that takes him from Iowa to Phoenix and takes his mind from
a device that he seems to have mislaid to a credible
rehabilitation.  FH drifts from youthful destructiveness to
mature redemption when he learns compassion for those in
worse shape than he.
   The story is narrated by FH in the non-linear mode
that we'd expect of a person who might be sitting next to you
on a barstool in an alcoholic haze, relating incidents from the
present time to, say, five years ago, moving up a couple of
years, then back again, and finally returning to the present. 
Filled with the exaggerations you'd expect from such a barfly
and with the occasional exploiting of the surreal, "Jesus' Son"
unfolds the story of a man whose life is redeemed partly by
his love for Michelle (Samantha Morton), a heroin addicted
woman desperate for love, and ultimately by a job he takes in
a home for assisted living.  
   Like any road movie, "Jesus' Son" takes its protagonist
through a series of adventures with bizarre characters,
allowing him to act out in his own peculiar way. In each case
he works to save the people he meets but ends up mimicking
the functioning of these losers, and failing because his
competence takes a back seat to his conviction.  The funniest
scene takes place in a hospital where he takes a barely
defined job and runs into an orderly, Georgie (Jack Black),
who boosts his meager salary by helping himself to
perks--like the pharmacy closet which is stacked with pills
that make the man even zanier than he is in real life. 
(Recall, if you will, Jack Black's role as a record
salesman in Stephen Frears' "High Fidelity" and you get the
picture.)  He meets and hangs out for a while with a
depressed divorcee, Wayne (Denis Leary), whose idea of
revenge is to destroy his own home and extract the copper
wiring for re-sale.   In a small role, Greg Germann performs
as Dr. Shamis, whose incompetence reflects FH's and is the
physician we all know, while Dennis Hopper turns in a
poignant role as Bill, who winds up in a nursing home after
being shot in the face by his latest wife.
   Samantha Morton, who most effectively played the role of a
mute woman in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown," is
somehow less productive this time around, perhaps because
her addiction to shooting up lacks the subtlety of her guise in
the Woody Allen work, but as FH's first genuine love, she
engenders in her man the desire to reclaim someone outside
of himself--while Mira (Holly Hunter) finishes the job of saving
FH from his feelings of emptiness . 
   Whereas Billy Crudup as Franklin Pierce in "Waking the
Dead" is a man climbing the career ladder to an eventual
Senate seat, this time around he plays to type but as the
more prosaic guy who is just trying to get his act together
and live like all the normal people he assumes are leading
happy lives with their families. In his relationship with the only
person who remains with him spiritually throughout the film,
Michelle, he reminds us of yet another of the many recent
films about drug and alcohol addiction, Mike Figgis's "Leaving
Las Vegas," even more than it does about those more
ostensibly about the drug scene such as "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas," "Trainspotting," and, most recently, "Groove."  
Alison Maclean's treatment of this lost Everyman inspires
hope in all of us, making effective use of sometimes
outrageous humor while simultaneously shunning cheap
sentimentalism.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     JESUS' SON is a film about addiction -- only it's not, really. The
way we're used to seeing films about addiction, there's a message, a
lesson, an agenda. Drugs are bad, the effects of drugs on users and their
immediate circle of acquaintances are worse, and our hero would be a
perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he
wouldn't just say no to. These tend to be films in which the ostensible
messed-up protagonist isn't really the center of the film. It's the needle
that's the center of the film, or the bottle, or the rolled-up $100 bill. 
Addiction isn't just the theme; it's the star.
     So let's re-phrase that introduction: JESUS' SON is a film about FH
(Billy Crudup) -- short for F***head -- a man who eventually becomes an
addict. He's no angel even before his addiction, however, a loner who
stumbles one day in the early 1970s into a party where he meets Michelle
(Samantha Morton). It's Michelle who eventually introduces him to the
wonderful world of heroin, and the two find themselves in a tumultuous
relationship over the space of a few years. Along the way, FH has himself
some crazy misadventures: helping a drunken pal (Denis Leary) tear up a
house for scrap wire; sharing emergency room ordeals with a pill-popping
orderly (Jack Black); and so on. Then Michelle leaves him, setting him
down the difficult road to sobriety.
     Actually, Michelle has already left him when JESUS' SON begins, which
is typical of the frisky, zig-zagging approach taken in adapting Denis
Johnson's collection of short stories. FH narrates his story with all the
straight-ahead narrative lucidity you'd expect of a perpetually stoned
guy; he riccochets back and forth in time, picking up one thread of the 
story in the middle of another story when he recalls something he's
forgotten to tell us. Director Alison Maclean and her trio of writers give
JESUS' SON a playfulness that's entertaining even as it never shies away
from the darkest sides of addiction. In one scene, a romantic song plays
while the camera tracks slowly toward a motel room bed, to reveal not a
lovers' embrace, but FH helping Michelle fix; in another, a split screen
reveals the alternate fates of two characters who have both taken the same
bad drugs. It's a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use
itself.
     But in case you missed the caveat, this is not exactly a film about
addiction. Billy Crudup gives a magnetic performance as FH, a peripatetic 
loser who has been given that derogatory nickname even before he ever
picks up a needle. In fact, his mutually self-destructive relationship
with Michelle is portrayed as a strangely stabilizing influence in his
fragmented life. Crudup finds a cohesiveness to FH's character through the
episodic film, and even manages to keep up with Jack Black's
scene-stealing orderly in the film's most hilarious segments. JESUS' SON
works not because the individual scenes are so effective (though they
are) or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting (because
it is not), but because FH is a great anchor for a film that heads in so
many different directions.
     Perhaps inevitably, JESUS' SON eventually turns to the subject of
FH's attempts to get straight, and it's a bit depressing that the film
loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved. The individual
moments -- FH's fascination with a Menonite woman, a conversation with an
aging fellow patient in rehab (Dennis Hopper), a relationship with a
member of his support group (Holly Hunter) -- feel more isolated, and it
begins to appear that there's no end in sight. Perhaps the come-down is
relative after such a wonderful first hour; perhaps there's nothing for an
episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop. Even the
sluggish conclusion can't diminish the surprising, darkly comic experience
of JESUS' SON, however. Even once FH is clean, there are still problems
for him to deal with. How refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to
the addict, to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting
player.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Jeremiah Kipp.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/90c952b9687313de882568ff000f6736?OpenDocument
It's a typical day in the life of rambling junkie F*ckhead, whom we'll
call FH for the purposes of this review. He just broke up with his
on-again, off-again heroin buddy and girlfriend, Michelle, stole a car,
drove to the local bar and is getting wasted with his buddy, Wayne, a
burned out husk of a human being and card carrying member of the Undead
Drunks Club.
After several shots of rotgut to wash down the uppers, downers and
endless fuel of smack, bleary eyed Wayne asks FH if he wants to make a
couple bucks to pay for the drinks they're gonna have later (we realize
it's only mid-afternoon by this point.) They meander off to a nearby
house and proceed to rip the copper wiring out of the walls. `Yep,'
Wayne chuckles. `This ought to be worth forty bucks  enough to get
drunk tonight. Heh heh.'
This is only ten minutes of Alison Maclean's whimsical junkie movie,
Jesus' Son, which drifts from one anecdote to the next. Our unreliable,
rambling narrator, FH (brilliantly acted by Billy Crudup), regards
everything he sees with a bemused detachment, whether it be munching on
his cornflakes while Michelle (Samantha Morton) shoots up after sex, or
taking a part time job as a hospital orderly in the emergency room among
fellow pill popping losers who raid the cabinets, desperate for a cheap
score.
We're given a series of episodes in FH's life in the mid-70s, and
unlike most films which dwell in this sort of seedy world, it never
judges the lives of its main characters. In fact, FH invites us to laugh
at their pathetic little lives holed up in cheap hotel rooms, passing
the time with sex and drugs, or telling long stories about their failed
love lives and immediate goals of getting wasted.
The characters are lovable without being `quirky', meaning they ring
true. FH encounters several personalities throughout, and each actor is
given the opportunity to shine in honest, lived in performances. Wayne,
the guy who rips the copper wiring out of the walls of what may or may
not be his house, is played by a surprisingly restrained Denis Leary,
for whom most of the fire has gone out. Underneath a sad sack moustache,
Leary gives his most haunted performance.
Just as good is Jack Black, fresh from his acclaim in High Fidelity, as
Georgie, who drives around with FH popping pills as they seek a place to
camp out in the open air one night. He's given the most surprising scene
in the movie after they run over a rabbit on the road, and he whips out
his knife saying that they will feast tonight. This unseemly behavior
transforms into something profound and miraculous in one of the film's
first of many small epiphanies.
While the film doesn't follow the traditional rules of storytelling
(feeling more like a series of faded super-8 films strung together on a
string), the offbeat themes and sketches offer glimpses into a world.
Maclean is attentive to the look of their ragtag, colorful clothes
(including striped yellow underwear or natty brown leather coats two
sizes too big), the gray and empty rooms with filthy beds and noisy
springs  maybe a TV playing in the background if they haven't sold it
yet, and the dreamy cinematography of Adam Kimmel which purposefully
allows certain images to blur or shift in and out of focus like
memories.
The screenplay (and assured editing) move backward and forward in time
as FH tries to sift through his thoughts about Michelle, often going on
long tangents as he stumbles to keep on track. Thankfully, he manages to
take exciting detours with Leary, Black, Holly Hunter and a hospital
encounter with Dennis Hopper, of course, playing a cheerfully grumpy
addict who offers a descriptive and strange tale of a former wife who
shot him in the face years ago.
Billy Crudup takes center stage in the film playing a passive character
with graceful strokes. He's always present in his scenes with the other
actors, listening, eyes roving around nervously and breaking out into
his infectious grin. Maclean found the perfect actor to embody this
lovably clumsy sod who's got one foot on the highway and another in a
puddle. While it ultimately doesn't amount to more than an amusing
shaggy dog story, Jesus' Son is simply two hours in the life of a
F*ckhead, with an eye for details and nuance that reveals the underlying
humor underneath the lives of the sad, the tattered, the broken and the
pathetic.

In Alison Maclean's `Jesus' Son', the audience is
provided with a narrator who sounds drunk, a
disjointed plot that doesn't make a whole lot of
sense, a handful of undeveloped lowlifes who are
supposed to pass as characters, and some heavy-handed
Christ imagery. However, by the end of the film, I
hardly cared, because although `Jesus' Son' contains
not an ounce of dramatic substance, Maclean's
disjointed, careless style suits the `slacker' tale
rather well. 
The film is based on a series of
semi-autobiographical, drug-induced short stories
written by cult favorite Denis Johnson. `Jesus' Son'
tells of the random misadventures of a 1970's heroin
addict named Fuck Head (Billy Crudup). Our narrator,
whom we first encounter on a dark highway, is FH
himself, who tells his story in a non-linear manner;
often forgetting and remembering, clarifying and
commenting. The tactic, which is meant to be either
humorous or interesting, comes off instead as
annoying. 
FH doesn't lead a terribly important life. Our
information about him is limited: he is a junkie, his
girlfriend Michelle (Samantha Morton) is a junkie, and
his friends (Denis Leary, Jack Black) are, you guessed
itjunkies. No background, no goals, nothing but drugs
and booze. It's not hard to imagine how that kind of
lifestyle can alienate a man. Indeed, FH lives a life
of cloudy alienation; a life in which the boundary
between a vision and a hallucination is a thin line. 
And, of course, `Jesus' Son' fits into the genre of
the tried and true `let's get sober' cautionary tale,
somewhere along the lines of `Drugstore Cowboy'. But,
after a dreadfully poor opening act, the film settles
down to find its own quirky charm. One especially
entertaining episode involves FH's night out with a
pill-popping peer played by the multi-talented Jack
Black (`High Fidelity'). 
With an eclectic soundtrack of 70's rock hits, some
`far out' hallucination sequences, and a cameo by
Dennis Hopper, pioneer of another drug culture,
`Jesus' Son' gets an A for style. It's too bad, then,
that the film is so shallow, because, with a bit of
substance, this could have been a cult classic.
`Jesus' Son' shows us how the characters use drugs,
but never tells us why. 
Alison Maclean (`Crush') directs this film with a
unique visual flair, shooting the more intimate
sequences on digital video. She shows a lot of
promise. It is the screenplay, written by three
people, that ruins a potentially strong picture. The
script never treats FH like a person, even if the
camera does. `Jesus' Son' is at times remarkably
atmospheric, and at other times remarkably bad. For
the most part, `Jesus' doesn't deserve your faith.

Screenplay: Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia, Oren Moverman
Starring: Billy Crudup, Samantha Morton, Denis Leary, Jack Black, Holly 
Hunter, Dennis Hopper, Greg Germann, Will Patton, Mark Webber, Michael Shannon
As the month of June closes I can't help but look back on all the shitty, 
joyless, but damn expensive Summer flicks I've endured; the kinetic 
showboating of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, the empty headed Toyota commercial 
visuals of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, the boring platitudes coupled with jerky 
action and BRAVEHEART's plot in GLADIATOR, the non-stop gross out desperation 
of ROAD TRIP, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon drawings of TITAN A.E. They 
all looked fantastic and seemed to hold a wealth of possible treasures, you 
know, the Saturday Matinee thrill of adventure with maybe some good 
characterization thrown in, but no, they pandered and failed to even elicit 
the cheesy thrills of past summer crapola like DEEP BLUE SEA or THE 
FRIGHTENERS.
So I return, my childlike hopes squashed, to the ol' reliable art house. I 
don my spectacles, attempt to procure a three-day growth of beard and I 
enter, tail naturally between those legs of mine, one of my old theatre 
haunts. Pleasant memories waft my way-- the friendly security guard babbling 
about Fellini films, the male ticket ripper with the eye-liner and the 
RESERVOIR DOS T-shirt, ahhh yes a world as full of magical incongruities as a 
Fellini film. You see in the early to mid nineties the art houses have been 
my refuge from the Hollywood crap that pollutes cities across this fair 
nation. I remember the hipster urgency of RESERVOIR DOGS, the sad\funny paces 
of TREES LOUNGE, the love of life found in BIG NIGHT, but that was long ago. 
I've been disappointed by these as well; most recently my trips to the art 
houses have been less fruitful; PECKER was John Waters homogenized (and he 
was the one doing the homogenizing, no lose), THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
was a choir to sit through, DESERT BLUE felt like a lame WB special complete 
with Kevin Williamson style quirks, and on. Most indie films are now just as 
manufactured as the 
mainstream ones.
Those "fringe" movies have spawned into their own little market full of 
flicks with their own brand of high concepts; the casual drug use, coolly 
unshaven men with tussled hair pontificating like philosophy scholars, hip 
white boys who use the "n" word like it's the ultimate badge of rebel cool, 
and the requisite Janeane Garafalo appearance. It's become just as tough to 
make a personal statement in that kind of arena so now previous indie film 
makers like Todd Solonz, David O Russell and Neil La Blute have migrated to 
major film, which is a good thing. It's about time for a shift.
JESUS' SON is chock full of the elements of indie films I've grown to loathe. 
It has the grungy-chic hand held photography, the medium close-ups of junkies 
shooting up, the quirky supporting characters, and it's a bit of an episodic, 
shambling mess vacillating wildly from one tone to another. But it has a 
certain lackadaisical charm, a bit of free wheeling gusto that those mapped 
out, formulaic big budget summer movies lack. Its actors and screenplay 
overcome the occasional handicaps, and maybe I would have given it an even 
higher grade had I not been so put off by its essential ingredients. (One can 
only sit through so many hiply off center philosophical junkie flicksâŚ). But 
it coasts on a sort of sedated charm that leaked through the screen and 
gently tap-danced on me. I felt like I was viewing something genuine, 
something with a distinct feel and voice and even some insight into its low 
lifes. This movie is at least alive while, nowadays, most indies come at us 
DOA.
Billy Crudup stars as Fuck Head (a nickname that stuck after he seemed to go 
out of his way to keep it) a passive drifter who lets life carry him 
wherever. He's a follower who stumbles into the junkie lifestyle after 
developing a dysfunctional relationship with a Michelle (Samantha Morton), a 
petulant junkie. He's a bit of a flaky idiot but a damn likeable one the way 
Crudup plays him. The actor gives FH a sort of off kilter John Cusack on 
smack vibe (the character could be the directionless Lloyd Dobler of SAY 
ANYTHING after being dumped by the Ione Skye character). He's charming in an 
enigmatic way with mannerisms that seem ever so slightly off. Crudup's an 
attractive actor (like a cross between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at their 
scruffiest) and for him to play this kind of loser with the same lived in 
baggage he gave heartthrob track star Prefontaine in WITHOUT LIMITS (the 
better of the two bio-pics of "the James Dean of track") marks him as not 
only a major talent but a very capable leading man just waiting to hit the 
mainstream.
FH wanders through several low down adventures, most unrelated, with a 
narrative that could kindly be called non-existent. The film is like a series 
of SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL shorts strung together, all featuring the same 
character and his progressions (or digressions). Each short has a guest star 
who most likely won't be seen in the next one. Dennis Leary, for once 
abandoning his rat-tat-tat delivery for subtle characterization, is one of 
those appearing briefly as a stoic drunk who tears apart his old home in 
order to sell the copper for money. Jack Black (HIGH FIDELITY) appears in the 
film's most amusing "short", as a hospital orderly who acts like a kid in a 
candy store. He has what may be the funniest scene I've seen all year; a bit 
involving mind-altering drugs, and incompetent staff and an impaled patient 
is like Preston Sturges meets Tarantino and all that implies. Dennis Hopper 
is sharper than usual as a craggy old drunk who got shot twice, by his two 
different wives and Holly Hunter acts exactly like Holly Hunter.
Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN, in which she was nominated for an Academy 
Award) appears in several of the shorts as the woman who loves and 
manipulates Fuck Head. Her child-like sweetness is matched with a world-weary 
quality that seems to be taking over. Their relationship is a passive 
aggressive one with the Morton character largely in control.
JESUS SON may be annoying to some for it's a film that's all ebb and flow, 
excitement and boredom. The film doesn't really end so much as run out gas 
which I suppose is appropriate considering the character's journey; if it had 
ended differently with some overly dramatic conclusion I'd probably be 
bemoaning it, though it seems that JESUS' SON overstays its welcome just a 
bit with its last twenty minutes seeming largely redundant, sort of like how 
it might be to watch Benjamin and Elaine from THE GRADUATE after they realize 
how wrong they are for each other (that had to be a real long bus ride) and 
begin getting on each other's nerves, eventually splitting up and returning 
to their old lives.
JESUS SON isn't a great film but in a time where indies seem to be dying a 
slow boring death, it's an appropriate return to what independent film should 
be doing. And after a month of wadding through high concept Hollywood crap 
it's just what I needed to get excited about the movies again.

JESUS' SON (1999) ** 1/2 Directed by Alison Maclean. Written by 
Elizabeth Cuthtrell, David Urrutia, Oren Moverman, from the eponymous 
book of short stories by Denis Johnson. Cinematography, Adam Kimmel. 
Editing, Stuart Levy and Geraldine Peroni. Music, Joe Henry. 
Produced by Margot Bridger, Elizabeth Cuthrell, Lydia Dean-Pilcher. 
Cast: Billy Crudup (FH), Samantha Morton (Michelle), Denis Leary 
(Wayne), Jack Black (Georgie), Will Patton (John Smith), Greg Germann 
(Dr.Shanis), Holly Hunter (Mira), Dennis Hopper (Bill), et al. A 
Lion's Gate release. 107 minutes. Rated R.
In her second feature (after the interesting, made-in-New Zealand 
"Crush" of 1992), Director Maclean has good company, especially the 
steadily up-and-coming Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton. But is Denis 
Johnson's  source book an ally? It's a collection of short stories 
with fairly personal,  strong and poignant passages about druggies in 
the 1970s. This sort of thing does not translate easily --if at all 
--into a  movie stream, a plot, a continuity. The film does try 
however.
The title came from a Lou Reed song called "Heroin" in which the 
lyrics go "When I'm rushing on my run, and I feel just like Jesus' 
Son..."
Billy Crudup plays FH, which stands for F---Head, which comes from 
anything that can go wrong around the man, doing so. Starting with 
Iowa City in the 70s, FH narrates several episodes in the fragmented, 
zig-zag way that so many sober people use when telling a story. Here 
it is reinforced by the influence of drugs on users.
The characters around FH are, like him, marginal to 
"average-standard" society, their doings and non-deeds are unreal or 
surreal, hallucinatory, with visions and all sorts of oddities. As FH 
(and others) move around the film is more bizarresque than 
picaresque, and a blackly humorous, tenuous but perceptibly present 
link to the old (yet very alive in independent films) Theater of the 
Absurd and to the humor of Jean-Luc Godard.
The main event in FH's micro-odyssey is his meeting and falling in 
love with Michelle, who shoots heroin. Before those two got together, 
FH was clean of hard drugs and something close to a slacker. But when 
the new twosome is formed, Michelle brings the young man to the Big 
H. Their relationship is on and off, often tumultuous, often 
escalating to major fights. From vignettes to larger episodes, the 
milieu of the couple (or of FH when he finds himself alone) is drawn 
in episodic ways, sometimes convoluted (but not so that you cannot 
follow), slightly to heavily comic or ironical equivalents of acts, 
scenes, and bits within scenes. What's incoherent is not the story 
but the lifestyle of its people --including the mysterious sources of 
money for Michelle's and FH's drug purchases, hotel rooms and 
groceries. (It's all the weirder since there are no hints of their 
dealing drugs).
Michelle and the other types are not especially likable or moving, 
but there's something simpatico about FH that calls for our hopes 
that he can find a better life. He seems to get close to this when he 
moves to an Arizona hospital for a strange mix of inmates: old, 
terminally ill, gravely handicapped, near-healthy (cf. Dennis 
Hopper's small part), or imaginary invalids (cf. Holly Hunter who 
throws away her crutch after sex with FH). FH himsef is murkily 
drawn, part in rehab, part as a touchy-feely nurse to the denizens. 
Some added surrealism uses mysteriously an Amish couple, including a 
quick bit where FH touches the Amish wife magically, through a pane 
of glass.
The film goes from attaching moments and involving bits to 
indifferent or alienating ones, then bounces back into acceptability. 
How often and how much I will decide only after a second look in the 
non-near future. Absence may make the heart grow fonder, and surely 
makes the brain work better.

Cast: Billy Crudup, Denis Leary, Holly Hunter, Samantha Morton, Jack Black
Director: Alison Maclean
Writers: Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia, and Oren Moverman, based on the 
novel by Denis Johnson
Review by Scott Hunt   Movie Hunt: http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html
Jesus' Son floats along with the hallucinatory feel of a drug addict's sense 
of recollection. It's not so much a movie as it's a well made patchwork 
quilt of memories. Its tales are woven together through FuckHead, or F.H. 
(Crudup), an intrinsically sweet young man who stumbles into the drug 
culture of the 70's. He remembers his life in a stream of consciousness, 
often interrupting himself to fumble back and forth through the gaps in his 
memory. It has a severely episodic feel with no sequence carrying more 
weight than another, save one. The film is based upon a collection of short 
stories in novel form by Denis Johnson, which based itself on a line from a 
Lou Reed song, "....When I'm rushing on the run, and I feel just like Jesus' 
son..."
F.H starts on his decent through the unknowing lure of Jezebel-like Michelle 
(Morton), who shoots up in front of him after their first night of 
lovemaking as he looks on, cluelessly munching a bowl of cereal. Soon both 
of them are suffocating in a fog of drugs. Morton infuses Michelle with  
equal parts of feistiness and emotional dependence in a shaded performance. 
F.H.  displays an incessant hunger for Michelle's attention. Their love 
affair comes across not so much as heart felt emotion, but rather a vampiric 
sucking of life force. Drugs have leeched away part of their ability to 
connect with others and they use each other, much as a drug, to continue to 
feel something in their nomadic lives. Their love affair ends badly, as does 
anything F.H. touches, hence his name.
F.H meets a possible future version of himself in Leary's character, a worn 
sparkplug of a man who long ago quit firing effectively. His hollow eyed 
husk of a man takes F.H. on an employment opportunity that consists of 
ripping the copper wiring from an apartment that may, or may not, belong to 
him. They sell the precious metal to fund a day of drinking and heroin and 
simpleton F.H. considers it one of the best days of his life. F.H. sees no 
moral implication to his actions or others. He simply exists in the moment. 
Leary's character shows the consequences of such a myopic view of life, a 
fate F.H. almost shares, if not for the twisted touch of his love for 
Michelle.
Holly Hunter as sensitive woman with a touch of death, Will Patton as a 
smarmy, albeit brief suitor for Michelle and Dennis Hopper as a recovering 
drug addict clinging to life each get a vignette sprinkled with some sharp, 
revealing lines. They give solid readings, but none truly stand out as does 
Jack Black as a fellow orderly F.H. works with in a hospital emergency room.
Georgie's (Black) Zen-like lunacy fuels some of the few laugh out loud 
moments as he performs unauthorized surgery on a man with a knife stuck in 
his eye, or performs his own seemingly hunger induced surgery on some road 
kill. Not only is it black humor at it's finest, but turns a probing eye on 
F.H.'s inability to cope with momentous events in his life as his memory is 
retold in two different lights.
Several times, subtle allusions are made to Jesus, each done in a disturbing 
fashion. At one point F.H. looks through the window of a diner, the 
lettering on the window making it seem as it he has a crown of thorns. He 
follows a snakeskin wearing man for no reason off the subway, and is 
surprised to find himself inexplicably aroused by his encounter with the 
serpent. A couple of times, people make reference to him not being "the one.
Jesus' Son  meanders along pointlessly. There's no plot to speak of, simply 
a recovering addict's ruminations on what brought him to the point he is. I 
wanted to feel emotional attachment to the angelic F.H., but as the film 
ended I realized I didn't really know him, so how could I truly care about 
him? I saw what heroin had made him, but I never got a real glimpse at the 
man he was before his adventure in wonderland. In telling his tale, he never 
manages to connect with the listener.

FH (short for an unprintable nickname) is a drug addict and the central
character in Alison Maclean's JESUS' SON.  FH, an unlucky loser, is
played by Billy Crudup, an actor last seen unimpressively in WAKING THE
DEAD.  He and his girlfriend, Michelle, pass the time by shooting up.
Michelle is played by Academy Award nominee Samantha Morton (SWEET AND
LOWDOWN), who was better playing a mute.  Although some films, most
notably TRAINSPOTTING, have had some success in transforming heroin
addicts into comedic subjects, addicts aren't exactly high on the list
of people normally considered hilarious.  JESUS' SON, based on a series
of Denis Johnson short stories and adapted for the screen by no less
than three screenwriters, never comes together into a cohesive or
compelling story.
Although some scenes, such as the one about a guy with a hunting knife
through his eye, possess a devilish black humor, most fall flat.  Dennis
Hopper's cameo turns unintentionally hilarious.  Shaving cream keeps
appearing and disappearing on his face in one of the more humorous
continuity errors in some time.  Most of the movie will leave you asking
yourself, "What was that all about?"  One of FH's obsessions, for
example, is regularly being a peeping Tom watching a Mennonite couple as
they go about their daily lives.  One can make some guesses as to what
it means, but the overwhelming feeling is that you don't care since FH
is such a distant and unappealing character.
JESUS' SON runs too long at 1:49.  It is rated R for graphic drug use,
strong language, sexuality and some violent images and would be
acceptable for high school seniors and older.
The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film
Festival (http://www.sfiff.org), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000.  It
is scheduled to be released nationwide in the United States this June.

FH lives a life of doing drugs and committing petty crimes. He spend his days
getting high, stealing and scamming, trying to get the quick buck to support
his habit and that of a beautiful addict named Michelle (Samantha Morton). FH is
also a compassionate guy who has an overwhelming need to help those around him,
but he is a miserable failure as a savior. Redemption does come to our hero,
though, when he lands a job at an assisted care facility and discovers the true
depths of his compassion for his fellow man and the grace it holds for him in
"Jesus' Son."
Billy Crudup stars as FH, which is short for "nasty expletive that begins with
an F" Head.  FH is a kindly soul and a naif in the wilderness of life. He is 
also one that is easily led astray. He has a self-destructive passion that he
exercises liberally with the use of drugs, committing crimes to support his bad
habits. This passion is shared by Michelle, but for the young woman, becomes
deadly. Michelle's death is a catalyst for FH, causing him to pursue his need
to help others. FH's journey brings him to a number of life-affirming crossroads
where the young man can see the wonders of life beneath the despair.
Along the way of his metaphysical journey of both mind and geography, FH meets
a myriad of colorful characters. When he goes to work in a hospital emergency
room, he encounters Georgie (Jack Black, "High Fidelity"), a pill-pushing and
pill-popping orderly with a crazed streak. He meets and treats a victim of
domestic violence - a man walks in with a butcher knife jammed into his eye,
but no one seems too worried about because "his vitals are normal and his sight 
is excellent." FH takes the miracles he sees as a chance of redemption for his
careless ways. But before he can exercise his new devotion, he agrees to help a
hang dog divorcee, Wayne (Denis Leary), in the vengeful act of destroying the
suburban home he shared with his now-estranged wife. When the pair OD on
heroin, only FH recovers and seeks the help and shelter of a support group.
He meets a half-paralyzed woman, Mira (Holly Hunter), in the rehab center and
they begin a relationship. Mira has lost more husbands and lovers to the Grim
Reaper than she can count, but, she can also dance and helps teach FH a few
things about life and love. To further serve his desire to help people, having
journeyed from Iowa to Chicago and, finally, to sunny Phoenix, he takes a job
at Beverly Homes, an assisted care facility.
The plight of the elderly and handicapped residents of the home is hard for the
sensitive FH to take, at first. He perseveres, though, and comes to understand
the curative effect a farm touch or a kind word can bring to someone all alone.
He even takes the task of writing the home's weekly newsletter, bringing a
little more pleasure to the inmates' sheltered lives. FH attains a grace that
makes him realize that he has found the fulfillment he has searched for all of
his life.
Producer/co-writers Elizabeth Cuthrell and David Urrutia adapt the short story
collection, Jesus' Son by Denis Johnson, into an episodic little yarn that
follows the life and learning arc of an odd young man, but one who has an
innocent, beguiling charm and naivete. As FH first attempts to help people, he
doesn't have a very good track record, but succeeds in getting a little better
at it through each vignette.  The episodic nature of the film, as adapted from
the necessarily episodic short stories, causes a problem of flow for the
overall story. Much of the first hour of the tale involves FH and Michelle, but 
there is not emotional payback when that episode ends. The rest of the chapters 
are more rushed than need be with sometimes-perfunctory treatment given to the 
other stories.
Billy Crudup, while not giving an Oscar caliber performance, does a solid job
of depicting the underlying sweet nature of FH. FH is a likable guy, not too
bright, but with a good heart. He always tries to do the right thing, when his
mind and morals aren't addled with drugs, so his desire for redemption for his
sins is nicely tied up by the film's end. It's a good-natured performance and
shows ability and skill by Crudup.
The "name" cast fares unevenly. Samantha Morton ("Sweet & Lowdown"), as
Michelle, is pretty and needy, but too much time is spent on her chapter with
FH, with little satisfaction for their story. Denis Leary seemed uncomfortable
in his role as the troubled Wayne. Dennis Hopper as an asylum inmate under FH's
care has little to do and his interlude is not compelling at all. Holly Hunter,
as the handicapped Mira, puts a sound edge on her character and comes out as a
positive influence on FH, despite her countless past encounters with death.
There is an unexpected surreal quality that permeates the film and it is not
just due to the overt drug subculture depicted. Throughout the story, FH has
visions, like a naked pregnant woman floating on air or seeing the heart of
Christ beating in a gangster's breast. There is also an extended sequence in
the last portion where FH becomes a peeping Tom. He begins a voyeuristic
relationship with a young, Mennonite woman whom he heard singing one day as he
passed her home. This is a bizarre, but oddly touching sequence that departs
from the rest of the film and, at the same time, is an integral part of FH's
final redemption and freedom of spirit.
Tech credits are straightforward, but not exemplary. Hired gun helmer Allison
Maclean does a solid job with the adapted material and, with the production
team, puts a unique spin and feel on each of the chapters. The uneven telling
of the tales is what hurts "Jesus' Son," not the technical and artistic players.
A credible performance by Billy Crudup, supported by a cast of vets, makes
"Jesus' Son" a cut above average, but just a little one, and I give it a C+.
Adapted from short stories by Denis Johnson, "Jesus' Son" is an
episodic ramble of a film which chronicles the experiences of a drifter/junkie
tagged with the name F*&$Head (Billy Crudup, "Without Limits") because
everything he touches goes south.
FH meets up with Michelle (Samantha Morton, "Sweet and Lowdown"), a heroin
addict who provides more surreal encounters with a cast of oddballs who
do things like shoot one another by mistake in their doped out states of
being.  FH drifts downward with Michelle ('Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance
with me'), alternating between fights and tenderness, until she eventually
ODs.  Then FH continues to drift through emergency rooms (where he'll meet
the infamous 'guy with a knife through his eye') and one rehab after another,
until he eventually finds redemption working in a nursing home and spying
on a blind Mennonite woman who sings hymns.
The large supporting cast features some good performances.  Holly
Hunter appears late and too little as woman whose boyfriends and multiple
husbands keep dying on her.  Denis Leary is another junkie ('all the good
vibes happen when Wayne's around').  Jack Black ("High Fidelity") is Georgie,
manic rehab nurse.  A quiet Dennis Hopper is a rueful rehab patient.
While the film's bizarre moments, such as FH's companion saving a litter
of bunnies by performing an on-the-spot road cesarean, are entertaining,
and its more serious moments, such as witnessing a palsied man find out his 
wife is divorcing him, are moving, the pieces don't connect well into a well 
rounded whole.  "Jesus' Son" earns most of its good will from Billy Crudup's 
likeable performance as a sort of holy fool.

What we have here is one of the year's most difficult films -- from a film 
critic's point of view. "Jesus' Son" is effortless to watch and hard to 
recall. That was fine when I was in the cinema, but now I'm at the keyboard, 
trying to convince you to see it, and all I can recall is loosely tied 
together events, sections that seem wandered into and inexplicable decisions 
by the characters.
But that is as it should be. This is the story of a young man who starts out 
a wanderer and then becomes a drug addict. Neither of these phases could be 
said to have reason or meaning. Still they are hypnotic to watch.
We know the guy only as 'FH'. You can pretty much guess what that stands for. 
It rhymes with "duck bed". He and some other anonymous buddies, who shuffle 
around a small Midwestern town in the early 1970s, drift through houses, bars 
and other unofficial hangouts. At one of these, FH (Billy Crudup) meets 
Michelle (Samantha Morton), a fascinating, quiet, petite girl who soon takes 
him to bed for surprisingly tender lovemaking. The morning after, he finds 
her injecting heroin at the breakfast table. He has never seen anyone shoot 
up before, but seems curiously unaffected by it, is enough of a vacuum to try 
it for himself, and soon finds that the narcotic is running his life.
Up to and after this development, "Jesus' Son" refuses to adopt traditional 
story structure. It is as meandering as many of the films from the time in 
which it is set, and indeed has even been photographed in the cheaply crisp 
and colourful style of a thirty-year old road movie. Moments of tragedy and 
comic absurdity all unfold at the same pace, side by side, seen by the idle 
camera as they would be through FH's glazed eyes. There is a harrowing 
split-screen comparison of two junkies' overdoses resulting in different 
fates. A Jarmuschian moment in a hospital where two stoned orderlies deal 
with a patient complaining of "knife in the head". Psychedelic drug fantasies 
wander onto the screen without warning. And yet not once does the sound 
design louden, the pace of the editing quicken, or the camera swerve.
I'm not exactly praising the discipline of the director, Alison Maclean, but 
more her courage to let the material move so stubbornly. The amazing thing is 
that we don't notice the rigid construction -- Maclean's tactics work 
wonderfully, and we get involved in FH's haze. Billy Crudup is well cast in 
the role -- he has the gift of keeping his body language technically lifeless 
while always looking like he's about to speak. He convinces us that FH is 
going nowhere, but still lets us hope for him; his eyes and mouth achieve a 
weird limbo that suggest they may spring into action at any time.
Strange, then, that the third act of "Jesus' Son" doesn't work. This portion 
of the picture is easy to remember, because in boring us, it breaks the 
hypnotic spell of the earlier passages. The screenwriters try to let fresh 
air run into the story, as FH finds redemption; but Maclean keeps up the 
quirky, cloudy ambience. FH's life starts to flow, but the narrative doesn't, 
and it feels wrong to see the film's closing events portrayed with a lack of 
focus, because in them FH finally opens his eyes.

Susan Granger's review of "JESUS' SON" (Lions Gate/Alliance Atlantis)
Adapted from a collection of short stories by Denis Johnson,
this episodic, un-rated film was heralded at the Venice and Toronto
Film Festivals and at the New Directors/New Film Festival in
Manhattan. It chronicles the adventures of a slacker who disdains
convention and is known only by a nickname that cannot be
printed. Let's call him F-H for propriety's sake, acknowledging his
uncanny ability to screw things up. As played by Billy Crudup ("Waking
the Dead"), F-H is a heroin-using hedonist, a passive loser, who is
out for thrills and excitement as he makes his way from Iowa to
Phoenix during the counterculture movement of the early 1970s.  The
title comes from Lou Reed's lyrics to the Velvet Underground song
"Heroin," and F-H spends much of his time hallucinating, often within
a religious iconography. On his travels, he encounters some pathetic,
oddball characters like the derelicts in a farmhouse where he hangs
out and gets stoned and a psychopathic emergency-room orderly (Jack
Black) with whom F-H pops uppers and downers simultaneously. F-H falls
in love with a free-spirited fellow addict (Samantha Morton of "Sweet
and Lowdown") until tragedy inevitably occurs. There are
subplots/cameos with Holly Hunter, Denis Leary, Will Patton, Greg
Germann and Dennis Hopper. Certainly screenwriter Oren Moverman,
producer-screenwriters Elizabeth Cuthrell & David Urrutia, and
director Alison Maclean ("Crush") aren't afraid to take risks
exploring the quietly desperate, black humor in themes of boredom,
alienation, death and salvation - all within a $2.5 million budget. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Jesus' Son" is an edgy, detached,
fragmented 5, but recommended only if you can tolerate graphic drug
use and rambling junkie humor.
