"RED CORNER" (MGM/UA)
Staring: Richard Gere  Bai Ling
Directed by Jon Avnet   Written by Robert King & Ron Koslow  
Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub
Jon Avnet's new film is an interesting and entertaining indictment of
the Legal system of Mainland China. Richard Gere plays Jack Moore, a
legal representative for an American satellite corporation hoping to
open up broadcasting opportunities in Beijing. Jack has worked with
officials of the Communist government before and is well liked and
respected. His charm and ability to communicate with those of differing
ideologies is considered honorable and imaginative. While setting up the
final proposals for the broadcasting rights, Jack meets a beautiful
Chinese Model at a fashion show. He is attracted to her, as she is to
him. A tryst develops, playfully erotic, growing into something more.
The neXt morning, Jack is awakened by the rough handling of the Red
Guard. The Model has been brutally murdered. Jack's shirt and chest are
covered in her blood. The Guards investigate the scene and place Jack
immediately under arrest. At his interrogation, he is told that there is
compassion for those who confess, but severity for those who resist. He
is assigned an Attorney, Yuelin (played by Chinese actress Bai Ling),
who urges him to confess to the crime to save his life. Jack steadfastly
refuses forcing Yuelin to investigate the case more that certain
individuals would like.
Red Corner is a strong film, with marvelous moments and a superior
central performance by Bai Ling as Yuelin. Richard Gere handles his role
as Jack Moore well enough, but doesn't really come to life until about
midway through the film. His portrait of righteous indignation at the
beginning of the film, while acceptable, doesn't give the film a strong
enough emotional core to hang on. As a character ark, Jack really
doesn't have a drastic enough change in his attitude to foster much
audience sympathy. Even when telling of the death of his wife and child,
you feel no pain for the character, as his burying of those emotions
makes it hard for the audience to really feel his plight.
And his plight is a hard one indeed. One of the most interesting images
in the film is of nameless guards looking in on Gere as he sits in his
darkened cell, the only light, is coming through a narrow slit in the
cell door. The feeling of isolation and invasion  permeates the film.
The main set, a libertine maze of streets and alleys that makes you feel
there are many secrets here, many lies that will never be resolved. The
first scene of the film, of Jack being photographed by a surveillance
video camera sets the tone for the film perfectly. He is no longer in
control of his own life. It is now controlled by the State. A State to
which he has no allegiance.
Gere's performance is workman-like and not as strong as some of his best
performances (Officer & a Gentleman, Internal Affairs). It's almost as
if he is trying to separate performance from his own personal
convictions (as his are now well known). It could be said that Jack
Moore is a man who's convictions are greater than his own life. But that
conceit seems trivial in the face of the overwhelming danger the
character faces. It is only in his scenes with Bai Ling, that Gere comes
to life. There is an honest chemistry between the two stars, and
Director Avnet uses it well.
Yuelin, therefore is the center of the film. Bai Ling's performance is
without a doubt one of the best of the year and it would be a shame if
the Academy overlooks her work in this film. She uses every inch of her
body in her performance (a telling moment when finally believing that
Jack may be innocent of the crime, her eyes cannot look directly at him
for long, darting away from one side of his face to his shoulder and
back, a marvelous and subtle performance). We feel the character growing
and changing against her own wishes, facing truths about herself that
she'd rather not.
The script by Robert King and Ron Koslow is taunt and well paced. The
setup and resolution of the crime are well constructed and solidly
delivered. The trial is presented in an interesting manner, showing not
the usual trickery of where a well placed argument convinces everyone of
the truth. Here, the accused is guilty, an idea of Chinese law
unfathomable to Westerners. These are presented mater of factly without
the usual hyperbole associated with thrillers of this type. The
political aspects of the film are given rather cursory explanation,
Chinese view Westerners as primitive sophisticates, with no thought or
conscience. In prison Jack is treated like a dog, an animal that would
have no thought as to weather it should eat it's own feces. This is
reinforced in a scene where, during Jack's escape, he hides in a small
animal pen, unnoticed by the Guards standing over him.
Director Avnet manages the film well. He is not intrusive in his style
in the way of the MTV style. Avnet uses his camera to  frame reality,
without resorting to stylized angles or tracking. The film is actually
rather standard, looking at times almost like a Television drama,
(similar too 'Fried Green Tomatoes'). The cinematography by Karl Walter
Lindenlaub is very straight forward, using  the 1.85:1 framing of the
film to give a feeling of intimacy and claustrophobia. Even the visual
effects by DIGITAL DOMAIN are unobtrusive, convincing us that we are
actually in China. You will not notice the effects as they are seamless,
the film was not shot in China, but rather in areas around Southern
California. All of the backgrounds are CGI or miniatures. The very fact
that the effects do not call attention to themselves  ensures that the
effects team will be ignored come Oscar. time.
This is Avnet's best film since 'Fried Green Tomatoes'. 'Red Corner' is
not a great film. It is flawed. But it's flaws show a heart and
willingness to tell a story that most films today seem to have
forgotten.

I was recently told that in China their had been strong protests against the
release of Red Corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the
injustice of many Chinese laws.  But if you ask me, the real truth of the matter
is that the Chinese Critics Association were determined not to punish the
population into viewing Richard Gere running across rooftops in search for a
fellow American.  Or more the point, anyone that allows him to bask in his own
less-than-subtle presence.
This is not an insult to Gere, as I consider him to be a rather talented actor 
but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role.
If a film is solely about one person, the main actor must give a faultless
performance in order for it to really work.  Although Geres performance is in
no way poorly acted, it is far from perfect  and I look forward to seeing him
star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film
by himself.  This is where he truly belongs, and if you are reluctant to believe
me than look no further that Primal Fear (with the sensational Edward Norton),
The Jackal (with Bruce Willis) and Pretty Woman (with the delightful Julia
Roberts).
In Red Corner Gere plays classy lawyer Jack Moore, who is guilty of the same
personality traits as his character Martin Vail in Primal Fear  bold and up
front, who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two
steps behind.  It is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that
the character of Moore is portrayed, which left me barracking for the Chinese to
haul his sorry ass into jail.
It doesnt take long from the films beginning for Jack Moores charm to work on
a pretty Chinese lady, and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room 
drunk and cheerful.  Yet instead of a hangover, poor Jack finds himself covered
in blood and the Chinese chick dead on a couch.  He is arrested and hauled into
a Chinese prison.  His cell, food and rights  all terrible.
Now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the American embassy,
lawyer Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to
the charge of murder.  Jack and Shen argue about their countries different laws;
Shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the
bullet to your family.
As the plot thickens, scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from
Richard Gere running over rooftops in search of the US embassy to a Scooby Doo
ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered.
Red Corner is one of those films where you sneer, laugh or vomit youre way
through all of its minutes.  What should have been a politically taunt thriller
is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out Richard Gere
can act.
This is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some
tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign
injustice and government corruption.   But what they amount to spoils the effect
of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why Red Corner is so
frustrating to watch.
If you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly, the basic idea is quite
tangible.  It is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and
developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing, the
high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all
been done so many times before.
If that wasnt bad enough, Red Corners dialogue is purely laughable on many
occasions.  Shen Yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a
destitute relationship with her deceased father, whilst Jack Moore is eager to
talk about Chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan
to free himself.
Taking itself far too seriously, Red Corner is not half the film it intends to
be.  Although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable
supporting cast, the films main fault is in the bizarre (and often out of
place) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway.
Whilst Richard Gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent
actor, I would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a
serious yet hollow drama again.  Martin Vailwhere are you?

At one point during Red Corner, I found myself more interested in following
along with a famous tune in the soundtrack, "I Heard It Through the
Grapevine", than I was in the film itself. Bad sign.
Red Corner, directed by Jon Avnet (Fried Green Tomatoes, Up Close and
Personal) stars Richard Gere as Jack Moore, a general counselor for a major
American entertainment conglomerate. He is in Beijing, trying to close a
multi-billion dollar deal to bring top tv trash to China. (Basically Baywatch
type stuff.)
It starts off interestingly enough. Moore meets a Chinse woman at a fashion
show and goes to her place for some good old fashioned movie sex. (You know
the routine. She wears his clothes, shots of champagne overflowing out of a
glass is a metaphor for orgasms.) He is awakened the next morning by a
Chinese soldier who drags him from the bed in his curiously blood-stained
shirt, shows him the slashed body of the woman from the night before, and
throws him in prison. Moore soon learns that the justice system there is
vastly different from our own, and is told repeatedly that those who confess
get off easier than those who try to fight it. Guilty until proven innocent,
and that is highly unlikely. 
Gere gives a flat, lackluster performance. His character is confused by the
goings on in the courtroom at one moment, then proves the judge wrong by
siting examples from Chinese law books a moment later. Moore becomes
emotionally, but not romantically involved with his attorney, and yet we are
never clear why. Neither shares a great deal with the other about their
personal lives. The emotional aspect is muddled and lost within  the attempt
at suspense. 
The editing is incredibly obvious in some scenes. There are occasional
flashes back to seemingly miscellaneous shots from earlier in the film. Breif
fades from black and white into color pull us out and makes us wonder what is
going on. Edits from the climactic scene cut between two similar-looking
rooms in which important action is taking place with two seperate sets of
characters. Yet the there are no transitions. The dialogue in these scenes
are all in Chinese, and so the viewer is forced to read subtitles, and gets
lost between rooms on the cuts.
This uninspired film tells us that if we are blamed for a heinous crime, we'd
better not be in China, because of what we'd have to go through. However, if
we are, there is certainly a way for the cocky American to beat hundreds of
years of tradition, and show China how its judicial system is wrong. Thumbs
down for everyone in and involved with this film. The only visually
impressive aspect is the Chinese courtroom. Production designer Richard
Sylbert manages to create an imposing, massive room that makes the accused,
and the viewer, feel incredibly unlucky to be there. There is nothing here
that we havn't seen numerous times before.
1 1/2 out of 4 stars.

     Although it is a formula picture, 'Red Corner' crackles with energy and
is at times a taut and suspenseful thriller which has good supporting
characters and a leading man (Richard Gere) who has never really impressed me
much as an actor but he does a good job here.  It was amusing watching Gere
get upstaged last year in 'Primal Fear' when a young, bright,
twenty-something actor (Edward Norton) stole every scene they were in
together.  While Gere shines as the protagonist of 'Red Corner', it is a very
realistic situation that he encounters.  
     How many times have we picked up the newspaper and read about our fellow
citizens being held captive in a foreign country, subject to the laws of that
land they have allegedly broken.  It happens often and it happens here.  Gere
plays a lawyer again (as he did in 'Primal Fear') only this time the stakes
are higher.  In 'Primal Fear' he played a criminal defense attorney and here
he plays a media attorney working to secure a large corporate contract for
entertainment programming in The People's Republic of China.  He is a smooth
talker and one night he takes a woman to a hotel room and the next morning he
is arrested as she turns up dead in the room and Gere insists that he is
innocent but he can't remember what happened the night before.    
     That is the basis for the prosecution's case.  How can this man say he
is innocent if he can't remember what happened?  Gere's defense attorney (Bai
Ling) at first remains loyal to her country's system of justice and pretty
much tells Gere that in her country people are not presumed innocent like
they are in America and if he pleads innocent he will be shot within a week
and the cost of the bullet will be mailed to his family.  She also tells Gere
that China has six times the population of the United States but only one
tenth the crime rate.  The human rights issue is never a factor with her at
first.  Slowly she starts to adopt western ideology and things start looking
up for Gere.  Or do they?  
     Director Jon Avnet ('Fried Green Tomatoes', 'The War', 'Up Close and
Personal') works well with the subject matter here and the movie's strongest
quality is detail.  It digs to the heart of a system in need of reform and
shows everyday life in a culture very different from the west in every way.
 The movie is easy on politics and long on emotion.  Writer Robert King's
screenplay is skillfully laid out with a convincing set-up, mid-section but
has a conclusion seen before in many whodunits but finds a way to be
entertaining using a different atmosphere.

Red Corner, just like other movies of it's type (The Trial, Closet
Land), reaffirms why I'm never going to a foreign country.  Now how
many times have we seen a movie about an American (in this case,
Richard Gere) going to a foreign land (in this case, China), only to
be accused of some crime (in this case, murder and rape) and then
whining for the whole movie about American rights and ideals and all
that? I mean yeah sure, we're a great country and all, but how many
movies like this do we really need?
I'm not ruining anything by telling you that Gere is framed in the
film, because never once is the audience led to believe that there's
even the possibility of guilt on his part. Remember, movies today have
no guts. Instead, we just watch Gere deal with being imprisoned in a
foreign land, dealing with the foreign people, complaining about
foreign law, etc. etc. We even know from the beginning why he's being
framed, and this may sound stupid but it's technically all based
around a clone of the TV show Baywatch. Yes that's right, a rip-off of
Baywatch causes Gere to be framed for murder.
Red Corner is a film with no new concepts or ideas whatsoever, but yet
is still slightly compelling enough to remain watchable, for the most
part anyway. By the last 10 or 15 minutes though I was just ready for
the film to be over and done with. Once the culprits were revealed, I
just couldn't have cared less. [R]

United States, 1997
U.S. Release Date: 10/31/97 (wide)
Running Length: 2:04
MPAA Classification: R (Violence, nudity, sex, mild profanity)
Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1
     The relentless preachiness engaged in by RED CORNER is the sort of 
approach that makes fire-and-brimstone sermons seem subtle.  If this was 
the film's only weakness, it might be forgivable, but director Jon 
Avnet's latest effort is an all-around stinker.  Pull almost any word 
out of a negative pool of adjectives and you'll have an accurate 
description of RED CORNER:  dumb, boring, painful, laughable, idiotic, 
moronic, inane, bad, etc.  Occasional scenes are almost salvaged by the 
effective performance of little-known actress Bai Ling, but, ultimately, 
her solid portrayal of a Chinese defense attorney gets lost amidst so 
much tripe.  RED CORNER is easily one of the year's worst big-budget 
motion pictures.
     Red China is apparently very upset with Richard Gere.  Not only is 
he an outspoken supporter of the exiled Dalai Lama, but, to add insult 
to injury, he has now starred in a movie that is openly critical of the 
Chinese legal system.  American movie-goers suckered into seeing RED 
CORNER should be equally outraged.  Gere's lackluster performance is one 
of the reasons why the film is close to unwatchable.  He vacillates 
between scenery-chewing and wooden displays that would make Steven 
Seagal proud, and his delivery of Robert King and Ron Koslow's ripe 
dialogue is often so overwrought that it's impossible to stifle a 
snicker.  Truthfully, the Chinese have little to worry about -- no one 
could possibly take this film seriously.
     Gere plays American businessman Jack Moore, who's in Beijing to 
wrap up a major deal with China's Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television.  Moore's American-based company is offering a slate of 
"pornographic, violent, and superstitious" Western fare, and, thanks to 
the support of the progressive-minded son (Byron Mann) of the Minister, 
they have the inside track.  Then, one night, Moore brings a Chinese 
girl back to his hotel room for some champagne and sex.  He is rudely 
awakened the next morning by Chinese police officers, who show him her 
dead body, point out that his clothes are soaked in her blood, then cart 
him off to prison.  Worse still, it turns out that the dead girl is the 
daughter of a high-ranking Red Army general.  Since American lawyers are 
not permitted to practice in China, Moore is forced to make due with 
Yuelin (Bai Ling), his court-appointed attorney.  Her advice:  plead 
guilty, since the legal code reads "leniency for those who confess; 
severity for those who resist."  But, despite being mistreated by his 
jailers and ignored by the American embassy, Moore is determined to 
prove his innocence.  
     In the past, with movies like FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, director Jon 
Avnet has successfully navigated the tricky line between drama and 
manipulation.  Here, he fails utterly.  There isn't a dramatic moment in 
RED CORNER that rings true -- not Moore's sad family history, his 
"courageous" moral stance in defense of Yuelin, nor the predictably 
over-the-top climactic court sequences.  For good measure, there's also 
one of the silliest foot chases in recent memory, with a handcuffed 
Moore leaping from rooftop to rooftop while half the Beijing police 
force inexplicably fails to catch up to him.
     The heroes in RED CORNER are few and far between.  Aside from the 
lone good American (Moore) and the one good Chinese citizen (Yuelin), 
it's hard to find someone who isn't duplicitous, self-serving, or 
downright evil.  Cartoon characterizations abound, and it isn't just the 
Chinese who suffer; every Westerner in RED CORNER has hidden motives, 
and no one except Yuelin is willing to risk their neck or career to 
stand up for an innocent man.
     From time-to-time, RED CORNER falls into the "so bad it's 
enjoyable" category, but the movie is much too long to be more than 
fitfully engaging for connoisseurs of awful films.  Those hoping for an 
intelligent expose of the Chinese legal system will likewise be 
disappointed -- the movie's political agenda is obvious, but not 
effectively presented.  This is yet another example of the white 
outsider struggling against oppression and injustice (Avnet has already 
used this approach once, in 1992's THE POWER OF ONE).  Maybe somewhere, 
buried deep under layers of dross, there's the kernel of an interesting 
story in RED CORNER.  But what reaches the screen is so irredeemable 
that it deserves to be consigned to the darkest, most obscure shelves of 
the local video store.

If I were asked to give a one-line synopsis of Red Corner it would sound
like this: Perry Mason in China. Red Corner is nothing but a bad episode of
Perry Mason set in China.
Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is a businessman in China. He is trying to sell
his satellite TV programming to the Chinese government. While taking the
night on the town Moore meets a beautiful model and takers her to his hotel
room for a night of sex. The next morning Moore is dragged out of bed
covered in her blood by the Chinese police. He is held in prison awaiting
his trial, which might prove to be short since the Chinese legal system
believes that leniency, is given to those who confess their crimes.
Moore is assigned a Chinese lawyer, Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling), who at first
believes that Moore is guilty, but after some evidence is shown, she begins
to change her mind. What follows is a look into the Chinese legal system
and some heavy-handed anti-China preaching.
The problem with Red Corner is that it is basically a typical made-for-TV
thriller that is set, unnecessarily, in China. The legal system that it
tries to show is one that is not much different from the US legal system,
and in some cases it looks as if it is much better. For example, Moore
escapes from the Chinese police and runs amok in the streets of Beijing.
When he is caught and brought back to the courthouse, nothing happens to
him. No further charges put against him, nothing. If he were in the US,
that would have been a different case.
Another problem with Red Corner is the uninspired script. Everything is so
cliched, especially the courtroom scenes. These scenes include everything
you would find in a typical made-for-TV court movie, including the surprise
witness, the surprise revelation by the accused, and the real killer
spilling his guts on the stand after a strong questioning session with the
lawyers. Moreover, Gere gives a bland performance in this film, and in some
of the supposed high-tension court scenes it is he who brings them down.
Whatever political beliefs Gere might hold against China, his performance
in Red Corner shows none of that.
The only thing that I enjoyed in Red Corner was the performance of newcomer
Bai Ling as Moore's attorney Yuelin. Ling has a commanding screen presence
and she, by far, outshines anything that this film puts out, especially the
performance of the big-budget A-list Gere.
Also interesting to see is how the filmmakers were able to make the film
feel as if it were shot in China. The Chinese government did not allow the
filmmakers to shoot in China for obvious reasons and the film makers had to
resort different measures to "create" China for the film; from scale models
to computer integration. Most of these effects aren't noticeable during the
film which is why it is interesting to see it.
Red Corner is, at times, implausible and a slow moving film. It tries to
show the inner works of the Chinese legal system, but doesn't accomplish
it. The whole film feels like a long bad episode of Perry Mason set in a
far away land that has the same laws, as does the US. Richard Gere who is
supposed to carry this film does not even come close, but it is new comer
Bai Ling's performance which is what is to be seen in this film. I cannot
recommend Red Corner if you are going to see it for its story. But, if
during a matinee, you have nothing better to see, see Red Corner for Bai
Ling's performance.
"Wow, the Chinese legal system is just like ours!" - audience member I
overheard as I was leaving the theatre.

Richard Gere's outspoken disapproval for Red China is the main motivation
behind RED CORNER, but making a bad movie to portray "bad" government is a bad
idea all around. Regardless of personal political convictions, it can be
assured that this film has potential to be marked "cruel and unusual
punishment" by many. If you're lucky, you'll have a choice between this film
and a good caning. I'm still split on that one.
Gere plays American businessman Jack Moore, the man responsible for handling
the overseas syndication of American television. In Beijing on a business
trip, Jack finds it hard to sell the Chinese media officials on western
entertainment, especially when the officials view such programming as
"pornographic, violent, and superstitious". Unable to convince them otherwise,
Jack spends the evening letting loose at a fashion show where he hooks up with
an artistic model and takes her back to his hotel room. Things take a
(melo)dramatic turn when Jack's awakened the next morning by Chinese police,
blood all over his clothes, and his one-night stand lying dead on the floor.
What develops (or under-develops) is a "one-man stands alone" routine as Jack
finds himself without help from the American Embassy or the assigned defense
attorney, who also happens to be convinced of her client's guilt. The attorney
is Shen Yuelin, played by the only commendable actor/actress in the film, Bai
Ling. Shen refuses to allow a guilty plea, explaining to Jack, who refuses to
comply with the plea, that there is "severity for those resist, leniency for
those who confess". This has become a tag line for the film, but trust me,
when it comes to seeing this film, resist, resist, resist!
In time, Jack begins to plant doubts in Shen's mind, and eventually, she
repeals the guilty plea and begins helping Jack search for evidence to prove
his innocence. All they know is the victim is the daughter of an influential
general, and whether this has anything to do with the case is hidden in
ambiguity (hmmmm, I wonder!), but the more they seem to discover, the more
thugs emerge from the shadows to "quiet" them. It's not a suspenseful film as
much as it strives to be. In fact, it's quite on the boring side. Gere has
always struck me as a very plain actor, and this film is just a showcase of
all that is mundane in film-making. He's just too unaffected by all the events
taking place around him, whether they be in his favor or not. We never even
get to know Jack before he's thrown into a jail cell and put on trial, so our
interest in his welfare is never achieved. As stated, Ling is the only thing
about this film that doesn't deserve a full-blown thumbs down. 
It's hard to say much about RED CORNER when it's such a bland production.
Courtroom dramas usually have a bit of depth to them as discoveries are made
and the clock ticks down. In RED CORNER, some crucial bits of information are
discovered, but the ending is sickeningly convenient and disappointing.
Regardless of events occurring in the first 115 minutes, the end result,
founded on sheer luck, would've been the same. That means all the developments
we sit through are there for nothing more than filling time. "You will be shot
in a week, and the cost of the bullet will be billed to your family," Yuelin
tells Jack at one point. Hey, I'll do ya one better: "You will be forced to
watch RED CORNER, and the cost of the ticket will be billed to your family".

   A colleague swears that he saw a picture in one of those
gossip magazines featuring Richard Gere with Cheryl
Crawford on one arm and the Dalai Lama on the other.  Why
not?  No words can better sum up the Richard Gere who eats
up the screen in "The Red Corner," a picture which is so
cleverly digitalized that you'd swear that the action was taking
place in and around Beijing's Tienanmen Square.  With an
opening timed to coincide with the high-profile visit of China's
president, Jiang Zemin, "Red Corner" is an effective
representation of Gere's views on the current Chinese regime
while demonstrating that he has the highest regard for its
pretty women.  (The dreamily intense, socially-conscious 48-
year-old actor made an impassioned plea for the sovereignty
of Tibet at the 1992 Academy Awards ceremony, a year after
campaigning for worldwide AIDS awareness.  If you're not too
clear on the connection between China's human rights abuses
and the situation in its western province, see the equally
politically-correct movie, "Seven Days in Tibet.")
   While some films made by Chinese themselves such as
"The Story of Qui Ju" more artfully criticize that country's
political conditions, they cannot match Hollywood for the slick
melodrama which director Jon Avnet delivers for his audience. 
Gere, his hair grayed over and closely cropped, is cast in the
role of an businessman competing for a lucrative contract in a
potentially huge market.  China is undergoing radical change,
some of its younger politicians eager to bring in sexy Western
entertainment to replace some of the more stolid forms of
diversion.  Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is competing with a
German executive on a plan to bring in American satellite
technology to one fourth of the world's population.  Seduced
by a model, Hong Ling (Jessey Meng)--who seems intent on
sketching Moore's long nose--he wakes up in a hotel to
discover his playmate murdered and is dragged away by
police.
   The bulk of the story deals with Moore's unfortunate
experience with the Chinese legal system and his more
fortuitous relationship with his lovely, intelligent and charming
attorney, Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling), who has been appointed by
the court to defend him.  Insisting that the best defense is a
guilty plea--which would almost automatically spare him from
an ignominious execution within a week of the trial's
conclusion--Shen is frustrated by her client's insistence on
proving his innocence.  
   Director Avnet allows considerable time for romantic and
sentimental attachments to develop between client and
lawyer.  She is unmarried in a culture that considers
singularity to be offensive but complains that China's one
billion men are too threatened by her intelligence to ask her
out.  He is a widowed graduate of Harvard College and
Stanford Law School, all the more desirable to Shen because
he did not grow up as the pampered son of a capitalist family-
-he worked his way through higher education serving at rich
people's parties.  
   Nor does Avnet disappoint the action-adventure crowd,
cramming an absurd, though heart-pounding chase as a
handcuffed murder defendant rushes toward the American
Embassy in a dash for sanctuary. 
   As in so many paranoid thrillers, the American officials are
almost as villainous as the real enemy, in this case providing
the businessman with little help because sensitive trade talks
are under way between the U.S. and China--a clear reference
to President Bill Clinton's alleged refusal to insist more
strongly that China takes steps toward greater human rights in
return for lucrative agreements with the States.
   "The Red Corner" has its heart in the right place, even
allowing its lead Chinese actress to argue that the U.S. is no
paradise but rather a country with only one-sixth of China's
population but with ten times its murder rate.  Politically,
though, the movie--from Robert King's screenplay--is whipping
a dead horse since we all know by now that Communist
regimes tend to be brutal, xenophobic, and reactionary.  But a
now mature Gere looks good on the screen and Bai Ling may
even give China's premier performer, Gong Li, some heady
competition.  With its Casablanca-like finale, chase scenes,
and political purport, "The Red Corner" is a well-made, if
generally by-the-numbers, sentimental thriller, balancing the
anti-Fascist agenda of a Costa-Gavras with the anti-
Communist program of Jon Avnet.  Rated R.  Running Time:
119 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten

Richard Gere follows his heart and stars in this picture that
ironically pits his character against the government of China. Let it
be known that Gere, a devout Buddhist, does not generate a huge
following amongst the officials of the Chinese government, as his
stance for the freedom of Tibet has been widely documented. 
PLOT:
Businessman Moore (Gere) goes to China to negotiate distribution rights
to American television programs with the government of China. During a
reckless night out, Mr. Moore hooks up with a sexy Chinese woman,
bringing her back to his apartment for a little nightcap. The next day,
Moore is awakened by the Chinese police, who charge him with the murder
of said sexy Chinese woman, now lying dead in apartment. If found
guilty, Moore could face the firing squad. The US embassy, many
high-ranking Chinese officials, and an intelligent Chinese defense
lawyer all get involved in this mysterious case. 
CRITIQUE:
Interesting, insightful, somewhat derivative, and a tad overlong,
suspense tale that managed to keep me awake and entertained through
most of its hackneyed tactics and plot twists. Granted, I recently saw
RETURN TO PARADISE (7.5/10) set in Malaysia, which was much more
original and gripping. True, the ultimate
American-caught-in-a-foreign-jail-cell film will always be MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS (8/10). But having said that, this film was good enough for
what it was (mindless entertainment for Mrs. JoBlo, me and some nachos
on a Saturday nite), and even offered some small moments of actual
suspense. 
The acting was so-so on Gere's part, who seems to be walking through
most of his roles of late, (on his way to the Dalai Lama's pad, I
imagine) but a great performance by his defense lawyer, Bai Ling, makes
the characters much more compelling than they might've been on paper.
Another thing that I liked about this film is the fact that it didn't
just show the Chinese justice system as an ancient, unfair system
compared to our "great"American counterpart. The film made sure that we
saw some of the strengths in their system, while simultaneously
demonstrating the real weaknesses that remain in ours. 
All in all, the film is no masterpiece by any stretch of the "fish out
of water movies" book of imagination, but I guess it didn't really hurt
while swallowing and left very little taste in my mouth, so check it
out if you feel like a decent thrilling flick set in a foreign country
starring the wonderboy of salt-and-pepper hair, Richard Gere (Note:
There's also a decent shot of Rick's big white ass at one point in this
picture...if you're into that kind of thing, that is.) Keep in mind
that I found the ending to be rather anti-climactic, and that the film
could have been cut by about twenty minutes or so, but with my nachos
warm and my Coke cold as ice, what the heck did I have to complain
about ?!?
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Richard Gere was married to supermodel by day, playboy centerfold by
night, Cindy Crawford for about four years. He was born in
Philadelphia, and was banned from the Oscars once after making
anti-China comments on the air at the 1993 ceremony.
Screenwriter Robert King also wrote the script for one of the 90's
biggest flops: CUTTHROAT ISLAND. 
Bai Ling played the character of Myca in the original CROW (8.5/10)
film opposite Brandon Lee. She was born in China, in the year 1970.

Who better than Richard Gere, to star in a movie which shouts political
views against the Chinese Communist Regime? We know much of this to be
true - the suppression of free speech, the unfairness of the judicial
system, the misrepresentation and maltreatment of prisoners, the
totalitarian nature of it all; but to make a movie about it when you're
buddies with the Dalai Lama, well isn't that just a tincy wincy bit
biased? If one wanted to explore the paranoid, unfair nature of the
Chinese Government properly - make a documentary. But to entwine the
political story line with the fanciful murder of a General's daughter
(Jessey Meng), a framed business man (Gere) and then to finish it with a
deep meaningful relationship with a Chinese lawyer (Bai Ling), is too
much even for me.
I was expecting a love story, but instead I found murder and intrigue.
It is difficult to believe that a powerful businessman would become the
unwitting target of Chinese government officials. Nevertheless, anything
is possible. Gere the businessman is accused of murdering the beautiful
model Hong Ling, the daughter of a powerful Chinese official. Gere's
character then goes through a round the mill sequence of maltreatment in
prisons and numerous attempts on his life, all conveniently ignored by
the 'evil' Chinese Government. I do not doubt that these cruel scenes
are meant to raise anti-Chinese sentiment. However, when his initially
pro-Chinese defence lawyer Shen Yuelin falls in love with him, then
decides to speak against the corrupt Chinese judicial system -
believability becomes a problem. This sinks to further melodrama when
Gere gets mushy about Yuelin and sacrifices himself to protect her
safety. This lies beyond my comprehension. They've only known each other
for a week and they can't even communicate well with each other.
This problem with this movie lies in the fact that it can't make up it's
mind whether to be a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda or a love story
about one woman's belief in another man's innocence. The resulting
effect is mixed feelings and odd moments. The attempt to combine the two
ideas doesn't work well, especially when the acting isn't a highlight.
SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET does a better job at causing China to lose face in
the eyes of the world. This movie merely pokes its tongue at the great
eastern power, but doesn't give the viewer much more insight than that.

Starring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling, Byron Mann, Jessey Meng
Ingredients: 
Beijing court, innocent Caucasian man, loyal female attorney
Synopsis:
Caucasian Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is at the People's Republic of China
to close a business deal with a high ranking Chinese partner involving
allowing American TV into the PRC; Jack is just about to close the deal.
That night he meets hot babe Hong Ling (Jessey Meng) and they go back to
his hotel room to get lucky. He is suddenly awakened by the police the
next morning, apparently framed for the murder of the beautiful woman. 
With the exception of one escape attempt, the rest of the movie is
mostly spent in the courtroom, listening to translated Chinese, where
clues and surprise witnesses come up. Moore is aided by a female
attorney (Bai Ling) who initially doesn't believe Moore but becomes his
loyal ally. Sometimes Moore reads off quotes from a Chinese law book.
Will their teamwork be enough to enable Moore to escape the messed up
criminal justice system?
Opinion: 
Red Corner doesn't contain much in the way of plot or suspense: a jailed
man waits a long time as a lot of evidence is presented.  This movie is
basically a character sketch of the corrupt justice system Moore must
suffer - - he gets about the same kind of justice you might expect from
a corrupt banana republic. But the ending is happy.
Says Director Jon Avnet, quoted on MGM/UA's Red Corner' Web Site:
"When I was in Beijing for a research trip and tried to take a still
photograph of the Beijing Intermediate Courthouse, I was accosted by two
soldiers with automatic weapons and persuaded not to continue my
photography."
"We shot Bai Ling riding a bicycle in Tiananmen Square at considerable
risk to her."
"There were people we met in Beijing who cared enough that we tell this
story accurately, that they were willing to risk retribution to give us
this information."
Historical Background of China and the Movies:
Coincidentally or not, Red Corner' opens as the real life presidential
summit between Chinese President Jiang and American President Bill
Clinton takes place in America. China is predicted by many to become the
world's largest economy next century, and this week's presidential
summit represents a warming of Sino-US ties.
The People's Republic of China contains approximately one fifth of all
the humans in the world. It became communist in 1949, after a civil war.
Meanwhile the defeated non-communist Chinese left the mainland and
exiled themselves to Taiwan to form their own government. Communist
China is now called the PRC (People's republic of China) while the
island of Taiwan prefers to call itself ROC (The Republic of China on
Taiwan) because it is controlled by its own separate government. The
Eisenhower administration in 1954 signed the U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense
Treaty which commits the US to protect Taiwan, ROC from communist
aggression.
Meanwhile, at China's western border China's military invasion of Tibet
occurred in 1950 resulting in the 1951 annexation of Tibet to China. A
Tibetan uprising in 1959 resulted in the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama
fleeing to exile to India.
The relationship between the US and China began to thaw when President
Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. US and China signed the Shanghai
Communique, in which the U.S. drops political support for Taiwan and
"acknowledges that  there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China."  In 1978 Chinese leader Deng paved the way for capitalism to
exist in communist China; he placed profit incentives and economic
progress above traditional Maoist goals, visiting America in 1979. Soon
business put China back on the map; Mr. Deng's policies resulted in
today's high economic growth rate.
China's relationship with the States soured after the July 4, 1989
Tiananmen Square incident. Then in 1995 President Clinton's decision to
grant a visa to Taiwan President Lee enraged leaders of the PRC. This
was followed by the 1996 Taiwan Missile Crisis, where China held war
exercises and lobbed missiles around the waters surrounding Taiwan about
the same time as Taiwan's first democratic presidential elections - -
and the US responded by sending two aircraft carriers to the region.
This occurred against the backdrop of increasing trade relations between
the US and China. 
This week's presidential summit between Jiang and Clinton represents an
upswing in Sino-US ties and further travel up the long road to better
communication. 
A Warming Trend:
In terms of 1997 film, look for an increasing trend of China related
film this year and next year. Red Corner' actress Bai Ling, is a star
in her native China, and Red Corner' is her first starring role in an
American motion picture. Taiwanese director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm')
and Hong Kong director John Woo  (Face/Off') are notable examples of
Chinese directors active in mainstream Hollywood cinema, but their
movies this year do not deal with China themes. However, movies by other
directors do: for example, two movies on Tibet (Seven Years in Tibet,'
and Kundun') and one James Bond movie with a Chinese female partner
(Tomorrow Never Dies,' North American release date December 19) are
scheduled for North American release before this year ends. Acclaimed
Hong Kong fan favorite actor Chow Yun-Fat star in what I believe to be
his first major Hollywood film alongside Mira Sorvino in next year's
(February 1998 release date) Hollywood action thriller, The Replacement
Killers.'

     "You will be shot in a week, and the cost of the bullet will be
billed to your family," warns the attorney for the defense.  In the
kangaroo courts in THE RED CORNER people are summarily shot unless they
confess their guilt quickly and beg for leniency.
     Jack Moore, played all too coolly by Richard Gere, is an American
entertainment broker who is in the People's Republic of China to
negotiate a huge television deal with the Chinese government.  After a
beautiful young woman in a nightclub invites him to bed, he is awakened
the next morning by a phalanx of troops.  With blood all over him, he
is arrested for the death of his one-night-stand, who turns out to be
the daughter of an influential general.
     As his court-appointed lawyer, Yuelin acts initially like a
dogmatic party bureaucrat.  Bai Ling plays Yuelin as a cross between
Hercule Poirot, Joan of Arc, and Patrick Henry.  Although at first she
insists on pleading her client guilty even if he refuses, she changes
his plea to not guilty and begins pulling one rabbit after another out
of the hat as she unearths clues.
     All of this sounds better than it is.  The script by Robert King
(CUTTHROAT ISLAND and SPEECHLESS) and Ron Koslow (LAST DANCE) is unable
to create any credible supporting cast.  Other than the two leads,
almost all of the Chinese are sinisterly evil and the Americans
incompetently duplicitous.  The script parades so many minor characters
past us that we need a scorecard to keep them straight.  All are drawn
in caricature, and none have any depth.  (One hint to the befuddled
viewer.  The merely bad Chinese wear military uniforms, but the most
nefarious are those Chinese in expensive Western suits.)
     Jon Avnet's direction does not alleviate any of the confusion
created by the jumble of the narrative.  Watching the film is rather
like trying to make out what two characters are doing as they weave
their way through a blizzard.  The story seems intent on making strong
political statements, exactly what they mean is less clear.  It would
appear that the film stands foursquare against brutality, but most of
the subtext remains murky.  This much is clear: Jack was framed by
powerful forces, and his eminent demise is merely a piece of some
cabal's larger plans.
     If the characters were more genuine or the story more plausible,
one could more easily be moved by Jack's mental and physical torture.
The scenes are stagy even if the settings are genuine.  And the movie
keeps testing how far we are willing to go in suspending disbelief.  My
favorite improbability occurs when the police state gives Jack a day
off from the trial so he can go to his attorney's house to plan his
defense.  They end up going all over town, albeit with guards, to track
down the clues.  Oh, and did I mention that Jack first asks his
attorney to demonstrate her skill as a musician?  One minute Jack is
worried about his execution, and the next he is much more concerned
with the well being of his attorney.
     Still, Gere is Gere, an actor who manages to rise above the
material.  The movie's makeup department, however, does him a
disservice.  Even after being beaten to a pulp the night before, he
shows up at his attorney's house looking impeccable, as if he had just
received a cut from the best hairstylist in Hollywood.  Sometimes, one
can look too handsome.
     Eventually, this Kafkaesque tale draws to its inevitable close,
with one more clue materializing and miraculously making all the
difference.  On the whole, watching an old Perry Mason rerun on
television would have been more satisfying.
     THE RED CORNER runs 1:53.  It is rated R for some violence and
profanity.  The film would be fine for teenagers.

        In a land where there the concepts of crime and punishment
differ so greatly from our own. Where a crime committed is punished by
a swift death in most cases. In this land, a man is framed for a
murder he did not commit. In the north American justice system a man
must be proven guilty but till then he is presumed innocent. In china
one must effectively prove his innocence, and until then he is
presumed guilty. Such is the task undertaken by Jack Moore and Yuelin,
the court appointed defendant. Justice is served both ways, and the
real truth comes out in the process. 
        My first impressions of the movie were not all that convincing
I thought it seemed fake. The setting didn't seem like it was China.
Although I have never been to China in my life and probably never will
go, the set for the movie didn't seem to be authentic enough. One
thing that always struck me when I saw pictures from Beijing, was the
volumes of people, and the volumes of bicycles another thing is that
the automobiles that were being driven there seemed awfully American
looking.  I don't speak from experience but this seemed to be a little
inadequate. Also upon speaking to a few of my colleagues who are from
China, I was told that the whole movie is a bit outdated. The policies
and the setting. Other than that it did seem like the setting was very
well created as well as the atmosphere. That was only a first
impression, and those aren't always the proper ones. 
        Now going back the setting and looking at with thought of the
plot, the setting, especially the atmosphere seems to be a little bit
contrived or set up. Something's just seems to be a bit too
predictable. The scenes that are shown are in some cases pretty
shocking to most western peoples, for they show the methods of justice
in a Communist China. But this too is not half as bad as it could have
been. Therefore I have to say that the part of the plot pertaining to
the set up and the atmosphere is good up until a certain point. It is
more than sufficient for the movie, but would have been better had a
stronger hint been given towards the real conditions of the day. Mind
you I am speaking from opinion only here so I should not be taken to
be anything other than some unknowledgeable guy stating what he
thinks.  Now onto the real plot of the movie, it was actually pretty
decent.  There were occasions where things just happened that left me
wondering what was going on and why. But they could be overlooked. As
a general whole the plot seemed to be fairly intact. A couple things
in the plot jump out at me as odd but they suit the movie in their own
unique way. 
        Now to the acting, here we have two different performances.
Richard Gere who played his character fairly well and quite
believably, and Bai Ling, who played her part superbly. Bai Ling's
performance was one that leaves you imagining that she is the actual
character from the story and not some actress. This is a feat not
easily achieved by most actors, especially actors who are not native
to speaking English. The supporting roles in this movie could have
been done a little bit better in my opinion, or the casing could have
been different but that does not ruin the movie nor does it add
anything bad. The casting for the main characters is really well done,
especially in Bai Ling's case. She should be proud of this
performance, lets hope it proves to be a good starting point for her.
        As a whole the concept of the movie is a really good one, even
if not the most politically correct one. The movie works well towards
what it aims to achieve, but it doesn't quite get all the way. As a
whole the movie is worth seeing and it is good thoughtful
entertainment. I found the movie to be fairly well done but a few
things stuck out, there was a bit too much action for a serious drama
and that's what this movie should have been. I guess they were looking
for some audience appeal, and probably found it.
