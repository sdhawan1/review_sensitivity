As I wrote in some of my earlier reviews, I encounter
somewhat embarrassing phenomenon when I watch cinema
classics. There are films that are universally lauded and
cherished as great achievements of seventh art. These are
movies I'm supposed to like and appreciate. But more often
that I would like, I find that some of those films don't
meet my expectations, made sky-high through the decades long
hype. These films, naturally, have some qualities, but those
qualities are not enough to justify their cult status. One
of such examples is THE AFRICAN QUEEN, 1951 romantic
adventure by John Huston.
The plot of the film, based on the novel by C.S. Forester,
is set in German East Africa in September 1914. In a remote
jungle village of Kundi, Reverend Samuel Sayer (played by
Robert Morley) and his spinster sister Rose (played by
Katherine Hepburn) are running Methodist mission. The only
link to civilisation comes in the form of "African Queen",
small river steamer that occasionally brings supplies and
mail. Its owner and captain is Charlie Allnut (played by
Humphrey Bogart), rough Canadian who would warn Sayers about
the war that erupted in Europe. Soon after his departure,
German troops enter village, burn houses and capture
inhabitants for the purposes of forced recruitment and slave
labour. Sayer is so devastated with the shock that he
suffers nervous breakdown and dies few days later. When
Allnut revisits now ruined mission, he finds Rose to be
alone. He volunteers to bring her to safety. He wants to
wait for the end of war in his jungle hideout, but Rose has
different plans. She not only wants to come to the
British-controlled territory, but also comes to the crazy
idea to use Allnut's supplies of explosive to sink large
German gunboat standing in their way. Allnut reluctantly
agrees with her and this is the beginning of the long and
perilous journey.
THE AFRICAN QUEEN was constantly hailed as masterpiece, and
often referenced as movie that finally brought well-deserved
"Oscar" to Humphrey Bogart. But, this film is disappointment
nevertheless - hardly a zenith in the careers of Bogart and
Huston. Of course, there are some good elements, mostly in
the script written by Huston and John Agee. The script uses
good old motive of "opposites attract" by putting two
totally opposite characters in unusual circumstances and
gradually showing the evolution of their relationship, as
well as the evolution of characters themselves. We watch
those characters - uptight, stiff-upper-lip British spinster
and rough and insensitive Canadian riverboat captain -
finding not only that they have more in common that they had
to admit, but also finding romantic attractions towards each
other. Both of the actors who portray protagonists - Bogart
and Hepburn - were past their prime when they made this
film, but they gave superb performance nevertheless, often
using humour to make their on-screen chemistry more
believable.
Unfortunately, when movie doesn't deal with Allnut and Rose,
it gets rather disappointing. The journey itself is
interesting, with many realistic problems and even more
realistic solutions. But the realism of the film is severely
undermined with melodramatic scenes in the latter part of
the film, followed by even more melodramatic, unbelievable
deus ex machina ending. It is even more so with extremely
dated special effects that fail to connect footage shot on
locations in (then) Belgian Congo and British Uganda with
characters obviously shot in London studios. Some of viewers
who are sensitive about "political correctness" would frown
upon not so favourable, even racist, treatment of natives in
this film.
The biggest problem I have with this film is, however, the
lack of historical accuracy. The film suggests that Germans
in East Africa at the start of WW1 had the upper hand, as
well as intention and resources to conquer the whole
continent, using the same brutal force and employing same
methods as Nazis would use in WW2. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. German colonies were scattered and isolated
from mother country, manned by small garrisons and generally
destined to be easily taken over by superior forces
stationed in bordering Entente colonies. It happened with
each of German overseas territories, with the exception of
German East Africa. Local commander, General Paul von
Lettow-Vorbeck, was putting stiff resistance to Entente and
lasted until the capitulation of mother country in 1918,
mostly using the hit and run strategy. That earned him the
reputation of one of the most successful guerrilla
commanders in history, and that success is impossible to
explain without at least some support from local natives.
German forces in East Africa perhaps were as savage as
depicted in this film, but such savagery was probably common
to their Entente counterparts; native Africans had no reason
to favour one colonial master over another. THE AFRICAN
QUEEN, one of the rare that actually deals with this exotic
theatre of WW1, fails to take that into account - flaw that
would be corrected only quarter of century later by
Jean-Jacques Annaud in his NOIRS ET BLANCS EN COULEUR.
Historical inaccuracies, bad special effects and script
flaws aside, THE AFRICAN QUEEN is still entertaining film
which is worth watching. Mostly thanks to excellent
performance of Bogart and Hepburn; two of them would make us
forget that the same story was later told in much better,
yet less celebrated films.

     Directed by John Huston. Written by James Agee and John Huston. Starring
Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, with Robert Morley and Peter Bull. 1951,
104 min., Not Rated.
     I'll be up front about this now, so that readers won't be surprised at the
lack of criticism in this review: John Huston's "The African Queen" is one of
my all-time favorite movies. The film begins with Reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert
Morley) and the members of his church singing. His sister, Rose (Katharine
Hepburn) is accompanying them, and eventually the crowd inside the church
disperses when a scuffle ensues outside between several villagers over a cigar
that Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) flicked to the ground.
     Sam and Rose go outside, where Charlie hands them their mail. He is
scruffy in appearance, a noticeable contrast to the clean-cut Sayers, who
invite him home for tea. Sam and Rose are embarrassed by but say nothing about
Charlie's growling stomach. As he readies himself to go back to his boat, The
African Queen, he mentions that a war has broken out. The siblings are
surprised and ask for details. Charlie says that the British and German are
fighting, as are many "little" countries, but he doesn't remember the
specifics.
     After he leaves, German soldiers invade the small African village that Sam
and Rose are living in as missionaries. They torch the dwellings of the
villagers and round them up, forcing them to march ahead to an uncertain
future. Sam and Rose are left behind, shaken. Charlie returns after awhile, and
Rose tells him that her brother has died. She gets her things together as
Charlie buries Sam, and the two set out for the African Queen, where they will
discuss their plans for escaping.
     The mismatched pair must learn, in spite of their disdain for one another,
to function as a team in order to survive, with comedic results. Hepburn and
Bogart have a humorous spark between them that really makes this film shine.
She is perfect as the straight-laced spinster, and he turns in an Academy Award
winning performance as the drunkard who becomes a hero with the help of a woman
who is his total opposite.
     In a somewhat unexpected plot twist, Rose, upon hearing that the Germans,
aboard the ship Louisa, may be nearby, eyes some of the materials on the
African Queen, and decides that Charlie and her are going to build a torpedo
with which they can destroy the Louisa. An incredulous Charlie agrees at first,
but later has second thoughts. As he realizes that she is more than a quaint
religious woman, and she realizes that he is more than a whiskey-swilling bum,
they become smitten with each other, sharing conversations about such things as
how they used to spend their Sunday afternoons (she would enjoy a nice, quiet
day, and he would usually be "sleeping one off").
     When Charlie gets cold feet about their plan and gets drunk, he wakes up
the next morning to find Rose pouring out the many bottles of gin he covets.
Although at first upset, we later see a revitalized man who is beginning to
regain control of his life and of the well being of himself and Rose. Facing
many obstacles, such as forces of nature and the ailing African Queen, they
finally catch some good luck and are once again hopeful.
     If you do not yet know how "The African Queen" ends, and do not wish to
find out, skip this and the next paragraph. After spotting the Louisa and
estimating how long it will be until they see it again, they begin preparing
the torpedo, and cleaning up the boat, as it will be representing the Royal
Navy. Before the Louisa passes and the plan can be put into motion, the African
Queen sinks and Charlie is captured by the Germans before finding Rose, who had
disappeared underwater.
     They are reunited on the Louisa, and are sentenced to execution by
hanging. Before they are killed, Charlie asks that they be married. The captain
agrees, and after they say "I do," the captain tells them, "I pronounce you man
and wife. Proceed with the execution." While the impromptu ceremony is
occurring, unbeknownst to everyone, the Louisa is nearing the mostly sunken
African Queen. As the nooses are slipped around Charlie and Rose's necks, the
Louisa brushes against the torpedo, and there is an explosion. The Louisa sinks
and the shocked duo bask in the ocean at their patriotic success.
     Filmed in Africa and London, "The African Queen" has wonderful
cinematography. The beauty of the African jungle and the harrowing experience
of the rapids are wonderfully brought to life. Huston is one of the greatest
directors in history, and this is yet another example of the best he had to
offer. Bogart gives the performance of his life, and Hepburn matches him stride
for stride. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this film is that it
starred two incredible screen legends that were completely in control of their
talents, and they work surprisingly well together, bringing to the movie a
special comedic chemistry that is the fuel behind the romance of Charlie and
Rose. The script, which Huston co-wrote with John Agee, moves swiftly and sets
the perfect tone for the movie.  This isn't the typical WWI movie, but it has
the elements of a top-notch adventure flick, plus much more. 
     Notes: Unfortunately, this film isn't available on DVD. It is priced at
under $10 on videotape, and also available in a more expensive collector's
edition.  Not rated, but suitable for family viewing.
    The Verdict: "The African Queen" is the quintessential adventure movie,
full of romance and laughs. Terrifically directed and acted, it is a true
classic that everyone should see at least once.

Classics rarely translate through the generations. What may have been a
spectacular journey into the unknown for audiences in the 30s and 40s might
have seemed different for those in the 60s and 70s. But whatâs really
frustrating (to me personally as a movie critic) is to not be able to see what
all of the praise was about in the first place. This is how I feel about The
African Queen, one of the later Humphrey Bogart movies, and (in my opinion,
donât sue me or anything) not one of his best. While Iâm sure that it
played with a much different reaction when it was first released in theaters in
1951, this is a film that (for me) has failed to translate itself for my
generation.
Charlie Allnut (Bogart, definitely at a change of pace from his detective movie
work) is captain of a boat that delivers mail to African colonies during World
War I. One this particular day heâs delivering to a brother and sister who
run a church for the Africans and try and convert them to Christianity. Rose
Sayer (Hepburn) is uptight and religious, quite accustomed to her nice, clean
way of life. When troops (I believe German) attack the camp she is forced to
flee and join Charlie as they sail down the river. She comes up with an idea to
attack an enemy warship that Charlie eventually goes along with.
All the usual sorts of plot cliches happen, at first they are afraid and argue
with each other, then they start to fall in love. There are many challenges to
greet them along the way. Rapids, leeches, enemy posts, itâs like the
filmmakers went through a list of all the possible dangers and checked them off
one by one. Will they survive the horrible journey? Or will the boat sink and
the two of them be gone forever? Almost all of the goings-on seemed predictable
to me.
I think that I have a much different view of the film than anyone viewing it
around the original time that it came out would. The cinematography is just
beautiful. The entire movie was filmed on location in Africa and the shots of
alligators jumping into the river and flamingos hopping in the water make up
some of the best parts of the movie. I also think that the film was sort of
making a point by saying that women could go on adventures and survive right
along with the men. An interesting side fact (that proves my point), the
filmâs tagline is, âThe Greatest Adventure Man Ever Lived...With A
Woman!â? But for all of the praise surrounding it, (Iâm really in trouble
this time. Number 77 on the greatest films of all time list on IMDB and I
didnât like it.) I didnât think that anything really happened in the story,
and therefore I didnât find the film very interesting at all. While Katherine
Hepburn does give a convincing performance, I didnât think that the film was
up to par with what it could have been. Obviously I have a different view than
when original audiences viewed it. Few people knew much about Africa then, and
not many people had ever been on such a grand adventure. Despite this, I still
canât give The African Queen too much credit, so it gets ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some slightly scary scenes involving rapids
and thunderstorms. There is also quite a bit of drinking and a gross scene that
has to do with leeches. Good Age 12 & Up
