     Kim Basinger has gone off to Africa on safari, in search of a
follow-up Oscar to the one she landed for L.A. Confidential.  Looks like
she'll be coming home empty-handed, I'm sad to say.
     Drawing comparisons to such Man vs. Nature films as Out of Africa,
A Far Off Place, and The Ghost and the Darkness, I Dreamed of Africa
tells the true story of Kuki Gallmann (Basinger), an Italian divorcee
who upends her life to move to Kenya with her second husband Paolo
(Vincent Gallo), who, ahem, dreams of buying a 100,000 acre cattle ranch
in the middle of nowhere.
     Life in Africa, Kuki finds, is hard.  Though her son Emanuele (Liam
Aiken; later Garrett Strommen) loves it, she has a tough time adapting
to the "different rhythm" of the wilderness -- mainly because that
rhythm involves fighting off elephants, snakes, lions, poachers,
bandits, bad weather, and Kuki's frou-frou mother Franca (Eva Marie
Saint, returning to the big screen).
     Kuki and Family survive one disaster after another -- until the
wilds take their toll, none of which seem to faze anyone very much.
Usually, Kuki will shed a brief tear, make a speech, and then move on
with life.  Two hours of this and the movie is over, and we've borne
witness to a largish chunk of Kuki's existence... but to what end?
Ultimately the movie becomes The Mosquito Coast, only set in Africa and
without an ending.
     I Dreamed of Africa sounds suspiciously like the adaptation of
Kuki's autobiography, which, of course, is what it is.  And as a book
adaptation, the story feels strangely abridged, as if the screenplay is
based on every other page of the book, willy-nilly.  The plot bounces
around without much cohesiveness, and few of the characters are
developed enough to become lovable.  This might all have been redeemed
if Basinger had turned in a tour de force performance, but ultimately
you don't get a real sense of what Kuki is all about.  You don't even
get a sense that Kuki is supposed to be Italian.
     In the end, we learn little more than the fact that Africa is both
beautiful and difficult.  Oddly, just like the movie.
Director: Hugh Hudson

Agoraphobic Kim Basinger hasn't made a film since her Oscar-winning role
in L.A. Confidential.  For someone that's afraid to leave their house,
you might have expected her next project to be a low-key affair with
generic settings so as to accommodate her limiting illness.  This makes
Basinger's decision to tackle the lead role in I Dreamed of Africa ? a
film primarily shot in Africa ? such a surprise.  And Basinger is better
here that she was in Confidential, but, unfortunately, trying to equate
the two films would be like comparing apples andwell, dog crap.
Africa is based on Kuki Gallman's autobiographical novel of the same
name, and (kooky) Basinger plays the role of the author in the film.  As
the picture opens, we learn that Kuki is a well-to-do single mom living
in Venice with her mother (Eva Marie Saint, My Antonia) and
seven-year-old son Emanuele (Liam Aiken, Stepmom).  After being badly
injured in a car wreck, Kuki falls in love with and eventually marries
Paolo (Vincent Perez, The Crow: City of Angels) a victim of the same
crash.
Paolo is a thrill-seeker who dreams of one day returning to Kenya, where
years ago he worked on a cattle farm with his brother.  As a little
girl, Kuki's deceased father would regale the girl with stories of his
adventures on the Dark Continent.  So, logically, the two decide to pack
up and leave Venice for a place in the African wild called Ol Ari Nyiro
Ranch.
Of course, Kuki and Co. have problems fitting in, what with the
poachers, lion attacks, struggles with the natives and dangerous
snakes.  Their home is literally falling apart and, to make matters
worse, Paolo leaves for days on end to play safari with his new
friends.  Kuki spends her time worrying, fixing up the house, working in
the garden and, although they don't show it, tending to her hair, which
is always quite pleasant-looking despite adversity attacking from every
imaginable direction.
Africa was directed by Hugh Hudson (My Life So Far) and adapted from
Kuki's true story by Paula Milne (Mad Love) and Susan Shilladay (Legends
of the Fall).  The film depicts about ten years in the lives of Kuki and
her family, but they don't really experience anything that we haven't
already seen before.  And unlike, say Out of Africa, there is absolutely
no chemistry between Basinger and Perez (maybe Alec Baldwin had a rifle
cocked and pointed at Perez during filming?).  The scenery is well-shot,
but that and Basinger's performance aren't enough to salvage the film.
The problem with Africa is that the story never really goes anywhere.
It's kind of an unfocused mess, and ends up being a beautiful bore.
Okay, Africa is dangerous and full of deadly animals and unscrupulous
poachers - I get it.  But there's going to be adversity wherever you
live.  Africans don't have to deal with traffic, school shootings,
disgruntled day-traders or Republicans.  And they probably don't have to
hear about Elian Gonzalez, either.
Hey, Africa doesn't sound too bad right now.
1:52  for violence, the depiction of animal murder and cruelty, brief
nudity and mild adult language

In I DREAMED OF AFRICA, based on Kuki Gallmann's autobiography of her
life in Africa, we learn that the Dark Continent is a beautiful and
dangerous place.  Of course, we already know that.  The film,
nevertheless, wants to teach what we already know and do it like a kid's
Golden Book.
As directed by Hugh Hudson and scripted by Paula Milne and Susan
Shilliday, the episodes in Kuki's life fly by at channel-surfing speed.
In an early scene, Kuki, played without much convincing drama by an
immaculate Kim Basinger, tells her 7-year-old boy, Emanuele (Liam
Aiken), that she's marrying her boyfriend, Paolo (Vincent Pérez), who is
taking them from Venice to live on a remote farm in Africa.  Although
this means giving up his friends and his grandparents with whom they
live, the boy's reaction is a quick surprise followed a second later by
complete acceptance.  Sure.
The tragedies are numerous (storms, car wrecks, poisonous snakes, wild
animals, poachers, robbers, etc.), and, rather than choosing a few to
develop properly, the screenwriters try to shoehorn them all in.  The
result is that episodes run by with the speed of cheetahs, and the
director rarely takes time to set up any of them properly.
Got poachers?  Let's organize a local army.  Okay, done with that idea.
What, you may ask, happened next?  Did the army do any good, or did they
end up getting themselves shot?  We're never told.  Storms blow in
without warning and then are over with and forgotten before you can get
interested.  Go to the restroom, and you'll miss a minimum of two
disasters.
The script reeks with clichés.  "What kind of people do this?" Kuki asks
when, almost as soon as they touch down on African soil, they look in
horror at the result of poachers.  "We think we run this place," she
says later in the story.  "We don't.  It runs us."
The men in the story like to do lots of guy things, like disappearing
into the bush to hunt and drink for a week or two.  Paolo, in
particular, isn't happy unless he is risking his life on a daily basis,
and Kuki's son exhibits this same foolhardy behavior.
One thing can unequivocally be said about the movie, Bernard Lutic's
cinematography is stunning.  But think about the material with which he
had to work.  From the ocean to the savanna, Africa is a photographer's
dream assignment.  Then again, some movies (FOOLS RUSH IN, for example)
can make even the Grand Canyon look ugly, so Lutic could have blown it.
My friend with me reminded me of a similar and much better show, "The
Flame Trees of Thika," which played two decades ago on Masterpiece
Theater.  The problem with I DREAMED OF AFRICA is that it tells a story
that we've heard many times before and usually with a much stronger
emotional impact.  Perhaps if the film were recut with fewer incidents
and more development of the ones left, it might have worked.  But, as
released, it only works as a travelogue.
I DREAMED OF AFRICA runs 1:52.  It is rated PG-13 for a scene of
nudity/sensuality and some violent/traumatic episodes and would be
acceptable for teenagers.  Kids under 13 run the risk of being
significantly frightened by the blood and the violence.

IN SHORT: I dream of a comfortable seat to snooze in.
Africa is a lovely continent and, when properly photographed,
breathtaking in its beauty. Set an incredibly strong story against such
a background (usually a foreigner against the Land and so forth) and the
effect is magnified. When the story fails to connect, to stir the
emotions in the audience, you have the equivalent of a travel brochure.
Such is the case with director Hugh Hudson's I Dream of Africa, which
hits your local movie screen with a sickening plop.
You can't put all the blame on Kim Basinger's one-dimensional portrayal
of Kuki Gullman an Italy-based American widow who takes on a new
marriage and a new life facing the extremely-alien, to her, African
continent. Settling in [Kenya] with new husband Paolo (Vincent Perez)
and kidlet son Emanuele (Liam Aiken). It's the job of the director to
get the best and fullest performance that he can out of his cast,
something the Oscar-winning Basinger is more than capable of. What makes
it to the screen indicates to me, at least, that Hudson seems more
concerned with avoiding controversial topics than with telling a
compelling story. When, early in the flick, Paolo disappears for days at
a time on a hunting expedition Kuki is p.o.'d because she hasn't learned
Swahili yet and has no concept how to run an African estate. Ducking the
question of European domination of African cultures -- heck unless I
missed a title card I'm not even sure what the proper timeframe for this
flick is, which is politically important to the background story-- we're
left with a standard stranger in a strange land story with performances
so bland that there is nothing that resembles a standard emotional story
arc. Lovely scenery, though.
We also found we got suckered by the accents and poor background
development in the first act (Italy). West Coast correspondent Paul
Fischer corrects us:

On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to I Dreamed of Africa, he would have
paid...
An utter waste of time and, in both our judgments, the worst drama we've
seen this year.

 Kuki Gallmann is an amazing woman whose story is a testament
to courage, determination, and tenacity.  Two years ago, I had the
privilege of meeting Kuki and spending several evenings with her on
her ranch in Kenya.  An Italian aristocrat by birth, Kuki (Kim
Basinger) begins her tale with how she met Paolo (Vincent Perez), her
second husband, who convinced her to move with her young son,
Emanuele, to Kenya in 1974, over the protests of her mother (Eva Marie
Saint).  Despite difficulty in adjusting to the tempo and pace of
life, the dangerous wildlife, greedy poachers, the ravages of nature,
and - most of all- the loneliness at Ol Ari Nyiro ranch, Kuki fell
passionately in love with Africa. Her devotion was so intense that it
withstood two devastating losses. Paolo was killed in a car accident
driving home with a cradle for their unborn daughter and, three years
later, Emanuele, an amateur herpetologist, was fatally bitten by a
puff adder. Yet, with all this inherent drama, the film skims over the
surface. Written by Paula Milne & Susan Shilliday and directed by Hugh
Hudson, it never develops an emotional connection between the
audience, nor does it communicate a challenging sense of
adventure. Instead, it unfolds with the languid pace of a magnificent
travelogue. While Kim Basinger is appealing, she doesn't capture
Kuki's zest and enthusiasm - let alone her flamboyant style and
Italian accent. In comparison with "Out of Africa," Kim's no Meryl
Streep, nor is Vincent Perez a Robert Redford.  On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "I Dreamed of Africa" is a stunning, lyrical 6. You
can stay at Kuki's Mukutan Retreat in Laikipia on the edge of the
Great Rift Valley to experience the wonders of Africa's
wilderness. But if you can't take that trip, seeing this movie is the
next-best thing.

   "I Dreamed of Africa" is based on the autobiography of
Kuki Gallmann, a privileged white woman who left her home
in Italy to travel with her new husband to his ranch in rural
Kenya.  The central thrust of the story is that the world does
not really possess a garden of Eden.  When you travel, you =
have yourself with all your hangups as a companion: the
literature of psychology is loaded with texts about how you
cannot escape from yourself.  Furthermore in Kuki
Gallmann's case, the very dangers of Africa were to cause
great hardship and tragedy to her family, perhaps beyond any
misadventure she would have experienced had she continued
to inhabit her privileged life in Europe.
   The author, who still lives on that ranch and who set up a
foundation dedicated to the conservation of the continent's
resources, is the subject of a film directed by Hugh Hudson
which appears a sincere attempt to remain true to Gallmann's
actual life and adventures on the continent.  Unfortunately
that earnestness is the problem with the movie.  As we watch
Kim Basinger inhabit the role of the resourceful Kuki, dealing
with both her joy in being able to change her life and her
spirit in coping with family disaster, we are privy to virtually
no real adventure.  A situation involving the calamity brought
about by a large, poisonous snake which her son had cruelly
kept in captivity along with other, non-venomous reptiles, is
such a variation from the languid, National Geographic-like
tone, that we are startled for the only time during the course
of the 113-minute, virtually humorless drama.
   Contrast this film with one that inevitably comes to mind for
comparison, "Out of Africa."  That 1985 film directed by
Sydney Pollack and featuring the superior acting of Meryl
Streep as Baroness Karen Blixen--a Danish woman who
marries her lover's brother--is chock full of the intensity
missing in Henry Hudson's staid adaptation of Kuki
Gallmann's book.  To borrow the opening paragraph of
Robert Ebert's "Out of Africa" review: "....there was a moment
when a lioness seemed about to attack, but did not....Now
the lioness seemed about to charge, when behind her a calm
voice advised the baroness not to move one inch.  'She'll go
away," the voice said, and indeed the lioness did skulk away
after satisfying its curiosity."  This bit of luck does not last for
long, however.  At another point, a lion charges from another
direction and the baroness must drop the big cat with one
shot that must not miss."
   Since none of these confrontations ever occurs on the
ranch owned by Gallmann's husband, we're left with simply a
sedate and sober travelogue with stilted dialogue (husband
and wife talk to each other as though they were composing
Hallmark cards) and confrontations which are set up but
never executed.
   "Out of Africa" takes place when East African countries
were attracting European settlers who were bored with their
lives in Europe in the years around World War I, where they
flocked to the highlands of Kenya with cool air and the
possibility of raising cattle.  "I Dreamed of Africa" gathers its
momentum some time after that.  In the story, Kuki Gallmann,
an attractive, widowed woman of some wealth, is almost
killed in an auto accident on an Italian road.  At that point, the
poor little rich girl decides that she "has stopped growing"
and, having married Paolo (Vincent Perez), she takes leave
of her frightened mother Franca (Eva Marie Saint), gathers
up her adorable little boy Emanuele (Liam Aiken) and heads
to Paolo's Kenyan ranch to start a new life.  =
   Though Kuki ultimately sets up a foundation for
conservation, we see no other evidence of the "growth" she
seeks, but we must trust her own words when she says that
she continues to find great joy in her move from her urban,
cultured civilization to a place in which her dog is killed by a
lion roaming just meters outside her home, her husband is
badly hurt in a hunting accident and later mugged and
beaten, she is left alone for several days at a time as her
macho man heads out with his pals into the jungles with their
rifles, and a terrible fate befalls her only son.  =
   If we did not know any better, we might suspect that this
film--shot largely in South Africa but also in parts of Kenya
and in Italian towns like Asolo and Vicenza--was made as a
propaganda piece in favor of white supremacy on the dark
continent.  The two principal servants of the household look
up to the owners as though they were gods; private planes fly
them at their will, in some cases to transport their growing
boy to a British-style prep school, in others to access help
during emergencies.  In one case, Paolo gives some swift
kicks to one or two men who have been captured by the
Kenyan police for poaching, a gesture which--while showing
us that poaching is a vicious crime--could make us wince at
the racial implications.  Kenya is, after all, not the land of the
white man.
   Kim Basinger is freighted with labored dialogue and
appears in virtually scenes as though she had just emerged
from a four-hour session at Revlon's in New York.  "I
Dreamed of Africa," which to Kuki is on balance a wet one, is
a nightmare that could cause many a potential tourist to
cancel his safari reservations.  We must simply trust Ms.
Gallmann, who at one point relates by e-mail to readers of
her book, (gmfkenya@africaonline.co.ke), "Africa is healing,
because it still has what most of the world has lost, and in its
ancient beauty and wisdom, in the mystery of its nature and
extraordinary people, one can find a purpose."  When she
talks to her husband or to her son, she sounds like this, too.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 2000
