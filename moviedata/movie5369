        This may be old hat to the rest of the world but here in the UK
Channel Four is running a series of Betty Grable musicals and this is one
I've never seen before, perhaps because it's raucous and rollicking tone may
have offended the tastes of past British film buyers. Frankly I found Betty
Grable a breath of fresh air, resplendant in the technicolour of this
hi-budget, low brow, comedy Western. Much is made of the comic talents of
Marilyn Munroe or Doris Day yet Betty Grable appears to have been
overlooked. In this wonderfully stupid film she's ballsy, brash and looks
like she enjoyed every minute.
The comedy arises from her arrival in a frontier town where the
dialectic between a new conservative class and an original rootin' shootin'
underclass is all too familiar. Betty plays a saloon-bar entertainer who
sings and does a trick shooting act. Yet through a comedy of assumptions she
is taken to be the new school mistress. She has to tame two hillbilly boys
whose sheer goofiness prefigures Beevis and Butthead. Ms.Grable controls
every scene she's in and brings the dopey twosome under her power by
adapting her handgun routine hilariously. A running gag throughout the
picture is her uncanny knack of shooting the town judge in the posterior and
much juvenile humour is generated from this which Betty just laps up.
However the film rarely stops for breath and pitches into a
slapstick gunfight with Betty at it's heart smashing, throwing, and shooting
for all she's worth. The history book on female comedy needs rewriting if
the name Grable isn't up there with the likes of Sally Fields. Gorgeous,
vivacious and crude, this could be a cult classic of unintentional camp.
Take your brain out of gear and it's great stuff.
