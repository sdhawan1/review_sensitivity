Rated R.
One of the responses those that enjoy "Detroit Rock City" (probably KISS
fans, mostly) might have upon first glance at the rating I've given the film
might be something like: "Oh, that Casey's gone and become a jaded critic on
us. Just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like
this?" I'm wondering the same thing. I feel like I should have had a grand
time with "Detroit Rock City." It's the sort of movie I wish I could've had
a lot of fun with, but I didn't. I just didn't. Surely this film isn't
trying to win any major awards, so should I have expected an Oscar-caliber
film? No, but I expected something. A funny joke. A clever prank. A plot
development. Anything. The movie never delivers. You've got to marvel at how
the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing.
"Detroit Rock City" is one of those films that you walk out of after the
credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a
movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence,
and it's not a very satisfying realization.
The film is about four teenage boys, all huge KISS fans from Cleveland,
trying to get into a KISS concert in Detroit, Michigan. That's it. There is
no big plot description in this review, because the movie has very little
plot. The characters are Hawk (Edward Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip
(James DeBello), and Jam (Sam Huntington). They have a garage band. They're
pathetic, like all garage bands, but they like KISS and they like rock n'
roll, so I guess that means we root for them. They have tickets, they lose
them. They get more tickets, they lose those too. They come up with crazy
schemes to get tickets, most of which backfire. There's not much more to it.
Frankly, it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get KISS
tickets about halfway through the film, when a total of eight tickets have
already graced the boys' hands, only to be lost because of their sheer
stupidity. Oh, and Jam (real name Jeremiah) has a really, really annoying
ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the Child Welfare Agency.
She doesn't want them to see KISS, if you hadn't figured that out already.
It's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in
a pointless movie like this. We've got plenty of KISS, along with some
AC/DC, Ramones, and Thin Lizzy. Then again, "Maximum Overdrive" had an
awesome soundtrack (me being the big AC/DC fan that I am), but is probably
one of the worst movies of all time. "Detroit Rock City" doesn't quite reach
that level of ineptitude, but it gets dangerously close. In fact, the music
is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my
mind. Basically, the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star, which
means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back (except for
Marilyn Manson, whose half-hearted cover of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell" sounds
like something my neighbor's cat coughed up).
It's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste, because it'
s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of
this dead turkey of a movie. Edward Furlong has done far better work than
this, and so has Natasha Lyonne, and so has Lin Shaye, but hey, they've got
to make a living in Hollywood. People wanting to see KISS, and lots of it
will probably be disappointed, considering the band appears for about five
minutes and plays one song. Too bad, they might have provided some energy to
this mess. Director Adam Rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work
with, so he takes a chapter from the Michael Bay book of directing and keeps
his camera spinning. We get an endless parade of quick-cuts, split-screens,
zoom-outs, zoom-ins, and rotating cameras, all in an effort to cover up the
sheer stupidity of the script. It's fun for a while, but eventually it
becomes disorienting. I would recommend that those who felt seasick at "The
Blair Witch Project" stay far away from "Detroit Rock City," because the
Witch has got nothing on this baby. I haven't felt such an urge to reach out
and hold the camera still since "Armageddon."
And what about that script? It's written by Carl J. Dupré, which sounds like
as made-up a name as I've ever heard. If it is, I can't say I blame the
writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible. A
plotless, pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun, if the jokes and gags are
actually funny. The jokes in "Detroit Rock City" rarely are. In fact, the
only time I really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a
marijuana-laced pizza, and that was just because it was so surreal. The rest
of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on
screen and called it "comedy." There is no set-up, just a succession of
punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles, precisely
because there was no set-up. It's as if they just whacked someone on the
head, pointed at him and said, "See? Funny!" Look, that woman was so shocked
by hearing loud KISS music that she spilled her drink. See? Funny! Look,
that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver. Twice. See? Funny! Look,
that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate
amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money.
See? Funny! A word of advice to Mr. Dupré: No, these things aren't funny all
by themselves. They must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn
't predicted them five minutes in advance.
That's it, I've said enough about this movie. It's a waste of time and
money. I liked the music, but don't bother buying the soundtrack. I hear it'
s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually
in the movie. You want to see this concept executed well? Go rent Roger
Corman's 1979 classic "Rock N' Roll High School." It features another
late-seventies rock band (The Ramones) and a far more interesting story
about a girl trying to get tickets to their show. Yes, go rent that, and
skip "Detroit Rock City," which will probably bomb, and deservedly so.

Set over a 24-hour period in 1978, "Detroit Rock City," directed by 
first-timer Adam Rifkin, is nothing much more than an ode to the hard 
rock/heavy-metal music scene, particularly the band, KISS, fans of which this 
loud, lewd, and crude comedy was made exclusively for. You do not, however, 
have to like them in order to enjoy the film, as proven by myself. Watching 
the film, I was entertained for the most part, even though it was obvious 
where the story was going every step of the way, but once it was over, the 
nagging question on my mind, as well as probably everyone else's, was, "What 
exactly was the point?" 
The movie doesn't take any time to get started, nor does it ever stop until 
the end credits begin, as we follow four stoner teenage boys who are 
determined to acquire tickets to the highly-publicized KISS concert in 
Detroit, Michigan, no matter what. Comprising an amateur metal band of their 
own, the members that make up KISS are their ultimate role models, and seeing 
them perform live has been something they have been attempting to do for 
three years straight. Once in Detroit, the film breaks off to follow each of 
the four protagonists on their own wild and wacky adventures. After Jam's 
(Sam Huntington) religious, chain-smoking mother (Lin Shaye) catches him with 
KISS tickets (whom she has dubbed the "Knights In Satan's Service"), she 
quickly dispatches of them and takes him to a boarding school. When Jam's 
three friends break him out of the joint and make it to the titled city, 
Jam's mother, there to protest the concert with other outraged parents, sees 
her son in the crowd and forces him to go to church and make a confession. 
While in there, a girl from school (Melanie Lynskey) who has had a long-time 
crush on him and is about the move away with her parents, runs into him and 
they have a quick tryst within the confessional. The leader of the group, 
Hawk (Edward Furlong), doesn't have enough money to pay the scalper, so he 
enters a strip contest at the local bar, and inadvertently catches the eyes 
of a voluptuous older woman (Shannon Tweed). Trip (James DeBello) attempts to 
steal some tickets off of a young kid at a convenience store, and gets into 
big trouble when he finds the child is with his much, much bigger older 
brother. And Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) must save Christine (Natasha Lyonne), a 
teenage disco diva who is being held hostage by a pair of car thieves.
"Detroit Rock City" has enough extra energy for several movies, and with a 
constant fast pace and 94-minute running time, doesn't overstay its welcome. 
Slight, stupid, and sparingly sweet in a few spots, the film fails, in part, 
due to the characters themselves. All of the subplots that are developed 
throughout are instantly dropped once the foursome inevitably make it inside 
the concert, watch KISS perform one song, and...well, that's it. The end 
credits blaze across the scene so quickly that it not only leaves you feeling 
unsatisfied, but also clueless as to why some of the up-and-coming actors 
even appeared in the movie, only to be wasted. 
The performances of the four main characters are servicable enough, but are 
no match for the colorful supporting players, all of which give it their 
valiant best, even when they have nothing to do. After making a splash in 
Woody Allen's magical 1996 musical, "Everyone Says I Love You," Natasha 
Lyonne has mostly been placed in small secondary roles (also see 
"Krippendorf's Tribe" and "American Pie") that do not give this big talent 
nearly enough to do. As the disco-loving Christine, Lyonne garners one of the 
film's biggest laughs but disappears for almost the rest of the film, only to 
make a brief appearance towards the end that has no payoff. Also a standout 
is Lin Shaye, as Jam's strict mother. Shaye not only has the most fun in her 
somewhat juicy comic role, but is also downright hysterically funny, and has 
a concluding scene that is even a little touching. Shaye, notable mostly for 
her standout role in "There's Something About Mary," is quickly becoming one 
of the queens of the "supporting roles," right up there with Janeane Garofalo 
and Parker Posey. And Melanie Lynskey, as the girl who pines for Jam from 
afar, momentarily brings some unexpected warmth to her scenes, but like the 
rest of the minor characters, leaves the proceedings too soon.
With one of the best film soundtracks to come along in some time (right up 
there with "Dick" and "Summer of Sam"), the '70s music keeps the movie 
energetic and lively, with a few original, lesser-known song choices. 
Additionally, the outstanding costume designs and set decoration capture the 
period flavor extremely well, and the lively cinematography, by John R. 
Leonetti, often feels like you are watching a prolonged MTV advertisement. 
"Detroit Rock City" is a passable time-waster, but shouldn't director Rifkin 
have aimed just a little bit higher in the substance department, so that the 
movie wouldn't be totally devoid of a reason for being? Coming at a time when 
"American Pie" has already depicted four boys losing their virginity at the 
same time, and "Forces of Nature" involved a comic scene in a strip joint, 
most of the movie feels just plain outdated, even for being set over two 
decades ago. A nice, respective try, but "Detroit Rock City" just misses the 
mark.

In the wake of the Columbine shootings, there have been many discussions on the
effects that movies have on our young society. The ratings system is obviously
not well kept, allowing films like American Pie, South Park: Bigger Longer and
Uncut, and Eyes Wide Shut to pass with R ratings.  Our television is also
becoming more and more violence dominated, with shows like Pyromaniacs Caught
on Tape and Buxom Blondes and Their Hotels airing on network television
nightly. Alternative and hard rock bands are ranking high on the charts
replacing all of the regular sugar choked pop that normally reigns supreme. But
what about one of the most outrageous bands of all time? KISS, (Gene Simmons
serves as head producer) tries to resurrect their career in this movie by
trying to bring out a state of teenage rebellion, but let's get back to the
young society subject.
Some politicians are damning every group possible (the gay community,
Hollywood, Oliver Stone) for destroying family values, they want a better
movie, TV, and music rating system, some are even suggesting that concerts be
rated. There is one simple answer to all of these issues, not exploiting any
person on the face of the planet to this film. This should indeed be labeled
with a fair warning of the idiotic badness (OK, bad and boring word, I admit
it) for all the crude humor and the lessons in everything but the ways to run a
family.
Four members of the band Mystery are hanging out in their pad in the seventies
and are getting high and playing some good old- fashioned rock and roll. They
are all devoted to KISS, they punish anyone who likes disco, and escape the
high school security guard on a regular basis. When one of their mothers
discovers her son Sam is listening to the devil, ("Don't you know what KISS
stands for?" she asks, "Knights In Satan's Service.") She is even more shocked
to find tickets to see the devil in the flesh and torches her son's tickets in
an instant. 
But not all hope is lost, one of the boys wins front row tickets in a local
call in radio station and they decide to break into St. Bernard's boarding
school where Sam in being held and go to the KISS concert. On their way they
lose their tickets again and the film follows each of their adventures while
trying to score the passes. 
If I'm correct, they are hundreds and hundreds of people that help contribute
and see over a film. The around $8 million budget didn't make any of those
hundreds of people make a better film. This is a horrible piece of trash is
only occasionally funny because of the amount of risks that it's willing to
take for a laugh. In fact, Edward Furlong is so devoted to KISS, he decides to
try and win a male stripping contest and ends up throwing up an entire pitcher
of alcohol. The more the film pushes the envelope, the more I found the film
belonging to the catergory of "Never After Columbine." But it was released
afterwards, luckily to a small audience that does not have to undergo the pain
and anguish that I experienced. Since this review is nice and cheery, and says
great things about the movie, I'm sure that you'll want to see it, Detroit Rock
City gets * 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains very strong language, constant drug and
alcohol use, horrible attitudes, violence, lots of sex scenes, and brief
nudity. Good Age: 16 & Up

DETROIT ROCK CITY
(New Line)
Starring:  Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello, Giuseppe
Andrews, Lin Shaye, Melanie Lynskey, Natasha Lyonne, KISS.
Screenplay:  Carl V. Dupre.
Producers:  Barry Levine, Gene Simmons and Kathleen Haase.
Director:  Adam Rifkin.
MPAA Rating:  R (profanity, drug use, adult themes, nudity, violence,
sexual situations)
Running Time:  95 minutes.
     By any objective standard -- assuming the term isn't meaningless as
it applies to film criticism -- DETROIT ROCK CITY is pretty inexcusable
stuff.  The humor sticks fairly consistently to drugs, alcohol, and other
undesirable teen behavior.  The Catholic Church is a constant target for
insults, with priests variously portrayed as larcenous or lecherous.  The
four principal characters have little or no personality, and aren't 
terribly sympathetic.  It's a frantically paced effort, the infantile gags
thrown around with a "quantity beats quality" mentality.  A sensible adult
human being clearly would be well-advised to hurl himself as far from this
film as possible.
     Unless, of course, that adult human being happens to have been a
member of the KISS Army in 1978.  That's when this nostalgic teen comedy
is set, sending its four garage band-mate protagonists -- Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Jam (Sam Huntington), Trip (James DeBello) and Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews) -- on a trip from their Ohio home to Detroit, where they will do
anything to score tickets to a concert by the band they adore:  KISS.  The
quartet find themselves caught up in various rowdy misadventures as they
try to get into the Cobo Hall show, including feuding with disco-lovers,
entering strip contests, and trying to escape the wrath of Jam's
fanatically religious mother (Lin Shaye).
     Director Adam Rifkin certainly took many of his cues for DETROIT ROCK
CITY from the seminal film about high schoolers desperately seeking
tickets to a hot band's concert, Paul Bartel's Ramones love-in ROCK 'N'
ROLL HIGH SCHOOL.  There are far worse models for a film of this kind.
DETROIT ROCK CITY is a dumb film, but it's a dumb film with such high
energy and such a shamelessly low-brow sensibility that it feels like
exactly the kind of film AMERICAN PIE wanted to be.  Teenage viewers may
be content to snigger at the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll gags, but the
cartoonish delivery of those gags makes them more fun than they have any
right to be.
     Then again, I viewed DETROIT ROCK CITY through some fairly
rose-tinted spectacles.  Though sporadically guffaw-inducing as a teen sex
farce, it's far more appealing as a pure nostalgia trip for a 30-something
ex-headbanger.  The soundtrack, though heavy on the KISS tunes, also
delivers Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, Thin Lizzy and the aforementioned
Ramones, not to mention the occasional disco selection.  The 70's icons --
8-track tapes, Stretch Armstrong action figures and Farrah Fawcett posters
among them -- set just the right atmosphere.  But Carl V. Dupre's script
is best appreciated by those who spent their adolescence fighting off the
scorn of the "KISS sucks" contingent, playing air guitar to Ace Frehley
solos and dreaming of attending a true rock spectacle.  It's filled with
throwaway KISS references only a true fan could love, like Trip's ironic,
pre-"I Was Made for Lovin' You" insistence that "KISS would never do some
bull**** disco song."  In all the ways that count, you really did have to
be there.
     It would be easy enough to begin and end with the idea that I was
bored and/or repulsed by DETROIT ROCK CITY, annoyed by the projectile
vomiting humor and the limp dialogue.  I could rightly acknowledge my
frustration with set-ups designed mostly to work teenage boys into a
lather of lust or disgust.  And I could note that while the performers
work hard to be appealing, there's just not much appealing about the
characters.  When it comes right down to it, the four teens are just
types, representations of everyone who wanted to go to a KISS concert so
bad they could taste the flashpot smoke...guys like me, for instance.
DETROIT ROCK CITY isn't a good film, but it's a film I couldn't resist.
As hard as it is under the best of circumstances to watch a film
objectively, it's even harder when you're watching the story of your life.

         When it comes to rolling with the changes in the music world,
KISS runs a close second to Cher. The band originally coasted in on the
glam-rock movement of the early 1970s, worked a few ballads like "Beth"
into their repertoire to broaden their audience, went disco in 1979 with
"I Was Made For Lovin' You," tried their hands at Alan Parsons
Project-style pomp-rock with "Music From The Elder" and returned to
their roots just in time for the '70s nostalgia craze. The closing
credits of "Detroit Rock City" find lead singer Gene Simmons belting out
a power ballad penned by Diane Warren, whose "I Don't Want To Miss A
Thing" put Aerosmith back on the top of the charts last summer.
 The KISS story would undoubtedly make a fascinating film, but
"Detroit," despite taking its title from one of the group's early hits,
turns out to have very little to do with the band. Instead, it focuses
on a much less intriguing quartet, four Ohio teens (Giuseppe Andrews,
James Bellows, Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington) who go to extremes to
catch a KISS concert at Cobo Hall in 1978.
 That too might have been a potent topic for a movie if anyone
connected with "Detroit" had any first-hand knowledge of what 1978 was
like.
 No such luck. "Detroit" is so poorly researched it prominently
features David Naughton's "Makin' It" and Rupurt Holmes' "Escape (The
Pina Colada Song)" on the soundtrack despite the fact they were released
in 1979 and then includes a reference to the Weather Girls' "It's
Raining Men," which didn't come along until 1982. The slang in Carl V.
Dupre's shoddy excuse for a script is also alarmingly wrong for the
period.
 Then again, what more should be expected from a film by
director Adam Rifkin, whose previous credits include "Psycho Cop
Returns" and the pitifully bad Charlie Sheen vehicle "The Chase"?
Rifkin's style, to use the term in its loosest sense, consists of
shooting his actors in tight close-ups and having them shout their
lines, as if that somehow makes dumb dialogue funny. Every bit of
slapstick is photographed from multiple angles which only goes to prove
how awkwardly set up most of it is.
 "Detroit" is sorely in need of the authenticity and easy humor
of "Dazed and Confused," the 1994 Richard Linklater comedy it's
obviously trying hard to imitate. But "Dazed" had characters the
audience could actually feel something for; "Detroit" offers insipid
cartoons, including a perverted priest, a gang of John Travolta wannabes
and a witchy mom, ineptly played by Lin Shaye. Even its "heroes" are
interchangable and charmless.
 KISS itself only turns up in person at the very end, performing
for a few brief minutes before the end credits roll. Fans who want to
see the band in action would be better off tracking down a video of
"KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park," a deliciously campy made-for-TV
movie that shows what 1978 was really all about. James Sanford

Teenage pot-heads risk everything to make it to a KISS concert.
With a synopsis like that, a lot of you may shrug off this picture as cheap
teen cheese. And for the first third, you'd be right. But like a discounted
junkie that straightens out his life surprising everyone with some actual
success, "Detroit Rock City" pulls itself out of high school mediocrity and
into actual good moviedom.
Picking up where Cheech and Chong (1970's comics who relied heavily on weed
for their humor, audience and perhaps inspiration) left off, "Detroit Rock
City" begins with a basement rock band of high school burnouts hell-bent on
finding their way into a local KISS concert. Mildly interesting during its
setting, the little film seems to lack what it finds later on -- heart.
After a series of mishaps the four boys decide to split up and have a try at
obtaining their individual "ins." This is where the story really takes off.
Each stumbles across a find more valuable than that prized entrance. The
film shows its true colors as a coming of age story.
One boy (Furlong) decides to enter a nearby male stripper contest. This
scene is a laugh riot and deserves high praise.
Set in the 1970's and produced by Gene Simmons (among others), this scrawny
little script eventually becomes a rich film.
Starring Giuseppe Andrews, James De Bello, Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington,
Lin Shaye.
Directed by Adam Rifkin. Written by Carl V. Dupre.
Produced by Gene Simmons, Barry Levine, Kathleen Haase at

How much luckier could 4 stoner types and would-be rock stars get in
1978 than being the proud owners of 4 tickets to the KISS concert in
nearby Detroit?  Not much, if they still had the tickets.
In Adam Rifkin's high energy farce, DETROIT ROCK CITY, 4 high-school
students -- Hawk (Edward Furlong), Jam (Sam Huntington), Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews) and Trip (James DeBello) -- share an undying love for their
favorite rock band, KISS.
Jam's mother (Lin Shaye), who takes bullhorns to rally crowds against
"Knights In Satan's Service," is a devout Catholic and is against the
band that she's sure is from Hell.  The chain-smoking mom uses the 4
tickets to light one of her cigarettes and then takes Jam off to
boarding school -- don't worry, his friends will bust him out -- to
shield him from the evils of the world, like KISS.
The story, full of sophomoric hijinks, has the kids off to Detroit once
they win 4 more tickets in a radio station call-in.  Needless to say,
all will not go as planned.
Along the way on the road to Detroit, they rumble with 4 disco-lovers.
In a fan war between KISS and disco aficionados, which side would you
bet on?
Later they encounter one of the disco girls, Christine, walking alone
along the highway. Christine is played with a sassy savoir-faire by
Natasha Lyonne from THE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS.  In six-inch heels, a
tiny skirt and enough make-up for a small circus, she's not someone
you'd miss noticing, especially if you were a teenage boy with raging
hormones.  In the funniest section of dialog in the movie, upon seeing
Christine alone, one of the lads observes, "They make horror movies that
start like this."  With a big grin, another remarks, "And porno movies
that start like this too."  Soon, they have the girl firmly ensconced in
the back seat of their car, which floats along the road with pot smoke
flowing out of it like a house on fire.
Once they get to Detroit, they're forced to find tickets yet again.
This time they're desperate.  Each devises his own scheme to come up
with the money to buy scalper tickets.  Typical is a plan to dance at a
strip-bar in front of a bunch of crude, tongue-wagging women of all
ages.
Many of the film's best lines are unprintable snippets of bathroom and
sexual humor.  The movie isn't exactly high comedy, but it does have
just enough laughs to recommend it.  Not surprisingly, the movie is
filled with a heavy, pervasive sound track.  The groups range from KISS
to Tchaikovsky.  Yes, that Tchaikovsky.  Now, that's a surprise.
DETROIT ROCK CITY runs 1:34.  It is rated R for strong language, drug
use and sex-related content and would be fine for teenagers.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
On paper it sounds horrible.  A cast of virtual unknowns, a director
(Adam Rifkin) whose biggest hit was The Chase, a story thinner than even
Runaway Bride, and the debut script from a guy (Carl V. Dupré) who was
the assistant editor of classics like Top Dog, Leprechaun 2 and Barb
Wire.  Did I mention that it also was about KISS?  Despite all of this,
Detroit Rock City is surprisingly fresh and funny.
The meager plot, which evokes memory of another guilty pleasure, The
Ramones' Rock n' Roll High School, involves four Michigan shop class
squares from Robert F. Kennedy High who desperately try to attend a KISS
concert in Detroit.  Of course, they also have their own band  Mystery
- that have had only one ill-fated gig during which singer Hawk (Edward
Furlong, Pecker) got stage fright and passed out.  Much of the film's
focus is on Jam (Sam Huntington, Jungle2Jungle), who finds his musical
tastes clash with his mother's (Lin Shaye, There's Something About Mary)
religious beliefs  she's even a member of M.A.T.M.O.K. (Mothers Against
the Music of KISS).  Rounding out the foursome are Trip (James DeBello,
TV's The 60s) and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews, Never Been Kissed).
Set in 1978 amongst the height of KISS hysteria, Detroit Rock City opens
with a wonderful montage of 70s pop culture images that run over the
opening credits.  We learn that the four protagonists have tickets for
that night's concert, but those tickets are discovered by Jam's mom, who
immediately burns them and enrolls her son in a private school, St.
Bernard's Veil of Tears.
When Trip wins four front-row-center tickets from a radio contest, he,
Hawk and Lex ditch class, narrowly escape Elvis the school security
guard (who resembles Wolverine from The X-Men), and proceed to bust Jam
out of his Catholic hell by lacing the headmaster's pizza with
hallucinogenic mushrooms.
Their drive to Detroit is marred by an ugly incident involving a gold
Trans-Am containing four disco-loving Italians  one of which (Natasha
Lyonne, American Pie) ends up riding with the boys.  Once they arrive in
the big city, adventures include a male strip club, convenience store
robbery, sex in a church confessional and a pack of angry junkyard dogs,
as well as romantic interests in the form of Shannon Tweed (Mrs. Gene
Simmons) and Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures).  By the way, Lyonne
and Lynskey are respectively named `Christine' and `Beth,' both names of
KISS songs.
The picture's ending includes a live pyrotechnic performance from KISS
(the actual original band), which will leave any red-blooded American
between the ages of 30 and 40 squealing with delight.  At least those
Americans that didn't own any ABBA records.  (1:32 - R or strong

I was born in 1975 - the same year, I've been told, that the KISS
legend began. Being a mere zero years old at the time, I had trouble
really appreciating their makeup and pyrotechnics and platform snake
boots. So I am not of the KISS generation. Sure, I know a few people
my age who had KISS lunch boxes when they were little, but I'm not
sure how they knew about them. My most vivid KISS memory is of the
time they decided to take off the makeup. So like much of '70s pop
culture, what little I know about KISS comes through beach towels and
trading cards and beat up plastic dolls at antique malls.
But I still loved DETROIT ROCK CITY, the new comedy about four stoned
teenagers in 1978 overcoming great opposition to see KISS play live in
Detroit.  As far as my born-too-late-to-really-be-sure eyes can tell,
the opening credits are the most accurate cinematic depiction to date
of the appeal of '70s pop culture. Vivid closeups of merchandise and
publicity stills take you on an epic rollercoaster ride through the
land of Fonz and Hulk. Newspaper articles and fuzzy radio reports
document the larger than life, comic book iconography of KISS. The
time and place are set, and the movie never falters or steps out of
character. You are in 1978, and you understand KISS.
Crucial to the movie's success is its dedication to the attitudes of
archaic teen genres of the past. This is more like ROCK N ROLL HIGH
SCHOOL than anything after FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH. It seems odd
that Paul Bartel doesn't make an appearance. From beginning to end,
the characters find over-the-top ways to outrage the authorities, or
to fulfill revenge fantasies.  Girl's restrooms are defiled, lifelong
crushes are consummated, bullies and car thieves are defeated or
attacked by dogs.  Modern teen movies often contain preposterous
stick-it-to-the-man scenarios, and they don't work. Take, for example,
the scene in SHE'S ALL THAT where Freddy Prinze, Jr. just has to ask
and two bullies eat pubic-hair pizza in front of the whole school. In
the context of a modern teen film, these scenes are embarrassing -
they clash with reality on about 17 different levels. Do the
filmmakers know how ludicrous these situations are? It doesn't seem
like it.  They seem to be trying to make something that modern teens
can relate to.  DETROIT ROCK CITY, though, takes a postmodernist
approach, so you know that it's supposed to be absurd when Eddie
Furlong, performing for middle aged women at a strip club, fills an
entire beer pitcher with vomit and manages to arouse the crowd
anyway. And you can laugh at the fantasy fulfillment of Furlong (who,
by the way, still has cheese in his hair from an earlier incident)
then being paid to have sex with erotic thriller queen Shannon Tweed.
A word about vomit: because of the aforementioned scene, clueless
critics will no doubt describe the humor as "grossout" and compare it
to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and AMERICAN PIE. But this is just one
disgusting gag in the context of a deeply funny movie. It doesn't come
across as a set-piece which other scenes are building toward or pale
in comparison to. It also has a precedent in the work of director Adam
Rifkin. In the obscure and underrated black comedy gem THE DARK
BACKWARD, one of Bill Paxton's many vile hobbies is showing off to
women by eating disgusting combinations rotten food.  A lot of the
humor also comes from the stylistic indulgences, beginning right off
the bat with an electric guitar version of the New Line Cinema
fanfare.  Rifkin loads the movie with goofy camera movements and
absurd period details (like Stretch Armstrong being used as a
weapon). Also of note is the score by J. Peter Robinson, which
attempts to elevate a scene of burning KISS tickets to the level of
unspeakable tragedy.  This is by far Rifkin's most masterful
directorial work to date. He crafts what could be limp material for
maximum laugh power. The tone of the pre-credits sequence reminds me
of the Drew Barrymore opening in SCREAM. The scene involves the mother
of one of the KISS-loving protagonists, played to perfection by Lynn
Shaye (who was indelibly burned upon my memory in KINGPIN when she
asked Woody Harrelson, "What is it about great sex that makes me have
to crap?"). Home alone at night, she pours herself a drink, lights a
cigarette, and chooses a Carpenter's record to put on and kick back in
her recliner. The atmosphere is tense, but Shaye doesn't get attacked
by a slasher - instead she's attacked by the quasi-outrageous rock 'n
roll of KISS, whose record apparently was hidden inside the
Carpenters' sleeve.  Shaye's character is the primary villain of the
piece, destroying the kids' tickets and dogging their quest every step
of the way, even leading a Mothers Against the Music of KISS
rally. The satanic threat of KISS seems quaint and silly by today's
standards, so the outrage they cause is almost cute. As a result,
DETROIT ROCK CITY joins SOUTH PARK and SUMMER OF SAM as this summer's
accidentally topical films after the censorial hysteria caused by the
Columbine high school shootings.  The large cast is uniformly
great. Sam Huntington is particularly likeable as Shaye's hapless son,
who is emasculated by being forced to wear brand new K-Mart clothes to
school. There are also small supporting roles for Natasha Lyonne and
Melanie Lynskey (the less famous HEAVENLY CREATURE, but the one
everyone likes the best).
I think part of the reason these characters are likable is the same
reason they're funny: they worship KISS. It's obviously corny and it
gets a lot of laughs on that level, but it's also something that can
be easily related to. I think most interesting people have had
something like KISS at some time in their life. For me it's KISS
label-mates Parliament, for some people it might be a TV show or a
movie star. You can almost join in their very genuine enthusiasm when
they scream and jump up and down and high five each other as they take
an elevator up to a radio station thinking their going to collect KISS
tickets. And you can also laugh knowingly as they go back down
ticketless, their shoulders slumped, the elevator music blaring, "If
you like pina colada"
This is a really well made movie. I'm a big fan of THE DARK BACKWARD,
and I also really liked MOUSEHUNT (which Rifkin wrote). But I'm still
surprised what a solid movie this is. I think it's the best comedy of
the summer. I can only imagine what a blast it would be if I happened
to have grown up a KISS fan.

The English language consists of hundreds of thousands of words, one for almost
anything that occurs or could occur in life.  Detroit Rock City can best be
summed up by one, simple word- energy.  At least that word is more positive
than my expectations going into this 70's teen film- I expected the words that
would sum the film up to be "horrible" and "cliche."  Being released the same
weekend as a smart, innovative teen film, "Brokedown Palace", Detroit Rock City
couldn't come at a better time, as many teens prefer "energy" over "quality,"
which will in turn boost Detroit Rock City's box office gross.  Along with
"Dick", a clever spoof on Watergate, "Brokedown Palace" was the second smart
teen film of the summer, but the streak ends here with Detroit Rock City. 
Unlike "Dick" and "Brokedown Palace," Detroit Rock City isn't about anything.  
Four pothead kids, Hawk (Edward Furlong), Jam (Sam Huntington), Trip (James
DeBello), and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) are our protagonists of sorts, who instead
of party to the then popular disco beats and bright clothing, jam to a
different beat, the beat of Kiss.  For the past three years, the foursome have
been attempting to scam their way into the annual Detroit, Michigan Kiss
concert, but have been unsuccessful- What will this year bring?  Will they make
it to their idol's concert this year, or will they be stopped by misfortune and
strict parents?
Some plot, eh?  Luckily, the weak screenplay (written by first timer Carl V.
Dupre) is brought to life by director Adam Rifkin, who presents Detroit Rock
City with so much energy, there's not a dull moment in the film.  Rifkin, whose
oddball camera angles and fast pace make Detroit Rock City interesting and fun
to watch, keep you involved with the film, until you realize that apart from
the slick direction, a few credible performances, and a few choice gags,
Detroit Rock City is as lost as the main characters are.
As the ultra religious mother of Jam, Lin Shaye's performance steals the show,
as she despises Kiss- with a passion.  According to her, the name stands for
"Knights In Satan's Service", and their music shouldn't be listened to by a
single soul.  Whenever Detroit Rock City's high energy level is down, Lin Shaye
rescues the film from dragging.
Our four main characters are all performed with strong energy and pizzaz from
the actors, but then again, it doesn't take much to walk around and scream. 
The only standout performance is from Sam Huntington, who is given more to do
from the screenplay than act wild and crazy.
The screenplay features no twists or turns, only one character with
development, and an ending that could have been seen just by hearing Detroit
Rock City's plot.  The climax of the film is awfully quiet, and isn't as
exciting as the rest of the film.  The definition of climax is- The height of
the film, or the turning point, which leads to the falling action- Not a
predictable, short snippet of film which isn't followed by anything except the
end credits.  Carl V. Dupre- Don't count on your screenplay career to take off
anytime soon.
Back to the word "energy."  Detroit Rock City's strong soundtrack doesn't
feature your stereotype 70's tunes, but instead includes a Kiss dominated
soundtrack, and believe me- It's LOUD.  Not even Star Wars Episode 1: The
Phantom Menace could win against Detroit Rock City in a loudness contest.  The
constant musical energy helps the film take off, but by the time this 95 minute
film's credits roll, you should have a pounding headache.
Although most of Detroit Rock City is loud and obnoxious, a few choice,
hilarious moments sneak in, which burst with originality, but seem out of place
in such a mediocre film.  The strong energy level makes Detroit Rock City worth
seeing at the dollar theaters, but non-Kiss fans could find themselves covering
their ears, and eagerly awaiting the moment when Detroit Rock City ends.  If
you are looking for a good rock and roll movie, and not a Kiss fan, like
myself, then check out 1996's That Thing You Do!, a much more fun, likable
motion picture.  Detroit Rock City is a variation on the average teen movie,
but I rather be watching "She's All That"s and "Varsity Blues"s than films like
this one.
The Bottom Line- Detroit Rock City will only "rock" a select few audience's
worlds, but the high energy level, and clever direction keep the film flowing.

When we think stadium rock the kneejerk association is the decadent
hairbands of the 80's. But there was a time when it was more pure. Or, less
pure, but in a more original way. The time is 1978. The band is KISS. The
place is director Adam Rifkin's Detroit Rock City, temporary mecca for
MyStery, a KISS-tribute band made up of Jam (Sam Huntington), Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Trip (James DeBello), and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), skipping school
and driving in from Cleveland on borrowed wheels and stolen time. Just four
guys on what for them is a pilgrimage, with all the necessary pitfalls,
pratfalls, obstacles, etc to make it interesting. To make it seem like they
won't make it, that this will be 'that' kind of coming-of-age movie.
Refreshingly, it's not that kind of movie.
Instead, it's the kind of movie with a soundtrack, maybe the best since
Robert Alt's Dazed and Confused. And yes, Detroit Rock City toys with some
of the same torch-passing type of generational material as Dazed and
Confused, but in a significantly less introspective manner than Alt. Which
gives it the freedom to go overboard, to have an overweight Elvis security
guard chase this KISS-tribute band into the future, a little retrospective
allegory we can all appreciate via dramatic irony: we know how the music
wars went. We know that KISS is in facepaint again and nobody has Saturday
Night Fever anymore.
All the same though, Detroit Rock City isn't just a movie for the faithful.
Instead of writing it for the heavy metal equivalent of the snickering
in-group Star Trek: Insurrection appealed to--and thus relying solely on the
nostalgic appeal of a mythic KISS concert to propel things--writer Carl V.
Dupre chose instead to make the concert's importance proportional with the
obstacles MyStery has to deal with to get to that concert. And, as they're
big issues, especially for Jam, having to deal with his MATMOK (Mothers
Against The Music Of Kiss) mother, the concert is important, even pivotal.
In case this isn't enough, though, Dupre also has a back-up structure: this
is Jam's last night of freedom before two years of boarding school. Which is
to say tonight they're going to let it all hang out, even dancing at a male
strip club for ticket money.
Which is where Shannon Tweed has her big cameo, playing Sylvia again from
Hot Dog, coolly oblivious to the 15 years between then and now, but still in
full possession of the camera. And then of course there's Paul and Gene and
Ace and Peter, playing themselves on stage, still breathing fire and
spitting blood. There's even a strange little shot of the audience from the
POV of Gene Simmons' throat, down along his legendary cow-tongue, which is
perhaps the one moment when the Detroit Rock City goes a little far. As for
the rest of it, though, just be satisfied that it's not Phantom in the Park.
It's 1999 now. Suddenly the devil's music is in DTS.

Every summer, there is at least one movie that gets caught in the landslide
of film releases, and gets lost in the shuffle. Unfortunately for DETROIT
ROCK CITY, it appears as though it has fallen victim to the BLAIR WITCH
hype, a lousy marketing campaign, and the lack of "name" stars to attract
its first weekend audience. But don't let that discourage you, folks...this
is one fun movie!!!
PLOT:
Set in the late 70s, four wryly teenage boys spend an entire day and night
trying to get to Detroit to attend a KISS concert. On their way, they are
led astray by various obstacles including Elvis the hall monitor, the
church-loving mom, Disco geeks and their own stupidity. Rock 'n roll music
burns throughout.
CRITIQUE:
I had a blast at this movie!!! This is a fast-paced, rock 'n roll
soundtrack-induced joyride of nostalgia, hilarity, camera tricks and fun
times! I loved this movie the whole way through, starting with its wonderful
collage of 70s memorabilia credits, the plentitude of references and
in-jokes to all things from that time period, the dead-on performances from
all of its stars, and of course, its satisfyingly predictable finale. I
laughed a lot during this movie, but I was also entranced by the plight of
these kids. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so determined to get
anything in my entire movie-going life! Anyone who's ever had to fight for
something they badly wanted, should be able to relate to these bad-lucked
geeks.
And yes, I also loved the filming style of director Adam Rifkin which went
way over-the-top but managed to mushroom into a perfect match to the rock
music, the "we don't give a fuck" attitude, and all of the wonderfully
cartoonish characters. I'll admit that nostalgia surely had a hand to play
in my over-exuberance for this movie, and maybe I'm just a sucker for shit,
dope and puke jokes, but there was definitely more to this picture than just
those simple factors. All of the actors played their parts flawlessly with
the mom (Lin Shaye) and pothead friend Trip (James DeBello) standing a
little above the rest. The soundtrack was superb, with a constant stream of
songs from the 70s bursting through the background. The settings were also
ideal, with the little touches certifying much authenticity, and more than
anything, the enjoyable, self-mocking style, along with the fun-loving
plight of the youngsters, made this movie an all-around good time. Much like
a moving comic book.
As you can see, the band KISS is not really a major player in this
movie...more like the goal. Now I may be going out on a limb here, but I
predict that this film will find its success in the realm of cult film
status. Natch.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
KISS members: Bassist Gene Simmons' real name is Chaim Witz, and he is born
in Haifa, Israel. Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley was born in Queens, New
York, and his real name is Stanley Eisen. Guitarist Ace Frehley hails from
the Bronx, New York, with his full name coming in at Paul Frehley. While
drummer Peter Criss hails from Brooklyn, New York, and used to be called
Peter Crisscoula.
Shannon Tweed, the actress who seduces Edward Furlong's character in this
movie, was once married to Gene Simmons, the bassist from KISS. She was also
Playboy Playmate of the year in 1982, and sired two kids with the
long-tongued man. She's originally from St-John's, Newfoundland, Canada.
Gene Simmons has also dated actress/singer/all-around weirdos Cher and Diana
Ross.
Edward Furlong got involved in a live-in relationship with his former tutor,
Jacqueline Domac, at the age of 15 (she was 27 at the time). She recently
went to the courts to request 15 percent of Edward's earnings for the last 3
years for abuse and breach of contract.
Natasha Lyonne's real name is Natasha Braunstein. She is currently known to
be dating co-star Edward Furlong.
Porn star Ron Jeremy, known to have a big dick, played the part of the strip
joint announcer in this film. He also had a small part in director Adam
Rifkin's 1994 film, THE CHASE. The IMDb lists him as having been in at least
500 porno movies. Wow. Now that's a lot of porn!
The budget for this film was approximately $15 million, and was filmed
entirely in Canada. Much was done in and around Toronto, including the
Cedabrae Collegiate Institute (high school) in suburban Toronto. The concert
scene was filmed at Copp's Coliseum in nearby Hamilton, Ontario.
Pain in the butt mom, Lin Shaye, has been a staple in all Farrelly Brothers
films. She played the "old lady" Magda, in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
(7.5/10), the infamous "landlady" in KINGPIN (8.5/10), and Mrs. Neugeboren
in DUMB AND DUMBER (7.5/10).
Marijuana-head, James DeBello, who plays "Trip" in this movie, also had the
part of "enthusiastic guy" in the summer of 1999's big teen hit AMERICAN PIE
(7/10).
Director Adam Rifkin has also been known to act in many of his own films,
and has also written several side projects. He was one of the co-writers on
SMALL SOLDIERS, and wrote 1997's kid flick THE MOUSE HUNT (6.5/10) all by
himself.
First-time screenwriter Carl V. Dupré, was once the assistant editor on such
classic films like TOP DOG, LEPRECHAUN 2, and BARB WIRE.
Giuseppe Andrews also co-starred opposite Edward Furlong, in one of 1998's
best films, AMERICAN HISTORY X (8.5/10). He portrayed the character of
Jason.
Some of you many remember the drummer in this film, Sam Huntington, from his
starring role in Disney's 1997 film, JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE.

        Whether you once worshipped at the altar of KISS, King Crimson, or
the Kinks, "Detroit Rock City" is the kind of movie that takes you back to
a time when music came on twelve-inch "long playing" records and grown-ups,
not Gene Simmons or Alice Cooper or Ozzy Osbourne, were the devil.
        This unashamedly nostalgic trip back to the Seventies features the
kind of songs you cranked up on your turntable until the neighbors called
the cops.  It features parents who just don't understand, including the
terrific Lin Shaye as a hyper-religious mother who torches her son's KISS
tickets while proclaiming the rockers to be Knights in Satan's Service.
        And, most gratifyingly, it features four young men--Edward Furlong,
Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello and, especially, Sam Huntington--who are
the tops when it comes to portraying the angst, vulgarity, and pleasure of
rebellious teens.
        Adam Rifkin's film has an undeniable charm, from the time our
hapless KISS-happy quartet first see their tickets go up in flames to when,
triumphantly, they fulfill their dream of seeing their heroes performing
live on stage.  (Did Gene Simmons really have that flap of skin surgically
removed from the underside of his tongue?)  Teenage boys, past and present,
may relate more closely to the film than most ("borrowing" Mom's Volvo,
losing one's virginity in a confessional box, falling into a hot tub full
of naked groupies, etc.), but there's plenty here for others to enjoy too.
        Nicest of all is that "Detroit Rock City," for all of the anarchy
inherent in its subject matter, is a rather sweet little film.  It's far
from perfect but, for a film that claims to "kiss the rules goodbye,"
surprisingly amiable.

In 1978, when he was still a protégé of Steven Spielberg's, Robert
Zemeckis directed a film entitled 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand', named after
the hit song by the Beatles and the story revolved around a group of New
Jersey teenagers in 1964 who take a road trip to New York City to see
the Beatles live on the Ed Sullivan Show.  It gave us a look at their
antics as the mischief and misadventures they got into were entertaining
as sort of a second class version of 'American Graffiti'.  The funny
thing about the film was that it worked because it didn't try and do
anything else besides entertain.  Ditto with 'Detroit Rock City'.  
Set in the year 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' was made, 1978, a group of
Cleveland teenagers do anything they can to see what they say is the
greatest rock and roll band of all time, KISS.  There is Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James DeBello) and Jam (Sam
Huntington).  This quartet of misguided youth sort of grow on you after
a while and you'll swear you knew someone like each one of them when you
were their age.  They have a band entitled Mystery.  They illustrate the
letter 's' in their band after the letters 's' in KISS and anyone who
knows KISS' style of design will know what I'm talking about.  
There always seems to be a monkey in the wrench that prevents young
people from having a good time and often rebelling because of it.  In
this case it's Jam's religiously fanatical mother, who says that KISS
stands for Knights In Satan's Service.  The opening scene has Jam's
mother taking out a vinyl record from a cover labeled after the
Carpenters and it turns out to be a mix-up as a KISS record plays and
Jam's mother goes into a frenzy of anger and frustration.  She
eventually finds the four tickets the lads have to see KISS down the
road a ways along Lake Erie in Detroit and she burns the tickets.  After
taking a Volvo belonging to one of their parents, they have to find an
alternate plan to see the concert and try at every turn to get in and
get more and more desperate as the film moves along.
Adam Rifkin, who has directed 'Denial', 'Welcome to Hollywood' and 'The
Chase', keeps 'Detroit Rock City' moving along in an extremely leisurely
manner.  You come out feeling good, as if you've had a vacation.  It's
also the kind of film that makes you a little embarrassed to admit you
like it.  The thing that makes the film work more than anything else are
the bizarre confrontations.  There are Jam's encounters with his mother,
the four teenagers confront a group of mean spirited disco lovers on
Interstate 90 and there are some hilarious confrontations with anyone
who stands in the way of the guys trying to see the concert.
Filmed in Scarborough, Toronto and Hamilton Ontario, Canada, the film
looks very authentic in its depiction of the U.S. and the era in which
its set, 1978.  The mischievous teenagers are convincing and like in
every good movie of its kind, one of them is a scene stealer.  Writer
Carl V. Dupre has the dialogue and style of the late seventies down
perfectly.  In a decade that gets a lot of ridicule for its fashions and
certain music, it also happens to be the decade with some of the best
rock music and some of the best movies ever made.  Like the seventies,
'Detroit Rock City' turns out to be nothing more than a guilty pleasure
as a party film for the summer, but that's all it needs to be and is a
refreshing look at teenage antics in a recent slide where so many of
them have just plain failed.

     Twenty years before Marilyn Manson put on ladies' makeup and
frightened the crap out of mothers around the nation, a little band
called KISS pioneered the idea, and played some good music as a bonus.
     While KISS was a few years before my rock & roll prime, they were
still quite popular when I was in school, and tales/rumors of Gene
Simmons' cow tongue, blood splitting, backwards-masked lyrics, and the
infamous `Knights In Satan's Service' moniker were the stuff of legend.
     Director Adam Rifkin would love to rekindle the KISS flame that we
all remember so well, but the movie doesn't quite live up to the
standards set by coming of age/adventure flicks like THE BREAKFAST CLUB
and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.
     You gotta give them points for originality, though.  Following four
Cleveland kids and their desperate quest to reach Detroit in time for
the big KISS show, Rifkin (whose only recognizable credit is the Charlie
Sheen bomb THE CHASE) takes a few fun and unexpected turns in an
otherwise rote story that provide some great laughs.
     But really, this is an unabashed movie about KISS fans, for KISS
fans.  There's nothing wrong with that, but let me just say that
watching a film in a theater packed with aging hard rockers trying to
regain their youth through the cinema is one of the more trying
experiences a critic can go through.
     It's nice to see Furlong and HEAVENLY CREATURES' Melanie Lynskey
back on the big screen, but they've both done far better material
before.  Let's hope to see some more of that again soon.

  It's 1978, and four Cleveland teens are trying to crash a
KISS concert in Detroit to see their idols after their tickets are
burned by a religious fanatic parent who swears that the group's name
is an acronym for "Knights in Satan's Service" and is a member of
M.A.T.M.O.K. (Mothers Against the Music of KISS). Edward Furlong,
Giuseppe Andrews, Sam Huntington, and newcomer James De Bello are
die-hard KISS fanatics and they're determined to attend the concert -
whether it involves winning front-row center seats in a radio contest,
spiking a teacher's pizza with hallucinogenic mushrooms, stealing a
car, selling their bodies, robbing a convenience store, or sneaking by
security. Between these escapades, they smoke dope and stop to beat up
a car full of disco fans in some half-witted defense of rock 'n'
roll. While the KISS members are prominently listed as part of the
cast and Gene Simmons is a producer, they only appear for a couple of
minutes on-stage amid pyrotechnics. But Mrs. Gene Simmons - better
known as Playboy bunny Shannon Tweed - does drop in as a romantic
interest, along with Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey.  (The latter
two are named 'Christine' and 'Beth,' which are names of KISS songs.)
Carl V. Dupre's screenplay seems to be lifted piecemeal from a myriad
of coming-of-age movies and has so many hateful caricatures of
Catholicism as to be quite offensive. Vulgar mockery of any religion
is not funny. Director Adam Rifkin relishes the tasteless sexism of
