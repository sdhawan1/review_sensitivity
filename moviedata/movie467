As a longtime fan of Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! type movies, I'd have
to say I thought this Italian made production (with suspiciously
American actors, spoken in English) deserved a better rep, because
although critics like Leonard Maltin panned it, it really isn't that
bad.
But I hate professional critics anyway. They never judge movies
fairly, and they never give credit to the really good movies, they
just think they do. This film is a prime example.
Rookie fed Joe D. Foster goes on his first big case, tracking
down a serial killer at a motel with the help of Dr. Animal Cannibal
Pizza (an absolutely hilarious Dom DeLuise, with two of his sons in
cameos), in this parody of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and PSYCHO.
Director/writer Greggio comes up with a reasonably funny farce
(his take on the PSYCHO shower scene is a riot), and
also gives himself a funny role as the serial killer.
If he plays his cards right, he could be the next Mel Brooks.
The only real problem with the film is that he can't
seem to decide whether he wants to do the movie like Mel
Brooks or like AIRPLANE! He kind of mixes them together,
and that's not a combination that works extremely well.
Other than that, the movie's worth a look. It's
pretty funny, and I look forward to many other
films from Italian Ezio Greggio.
