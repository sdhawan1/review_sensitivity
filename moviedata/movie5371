McBain (1991) * out of ***** - Cast: Christopher Walken, Michael Ironside,
Maria Conchita Alonso.  Directed By: James Glickenhaus.  Running Time: 102
minutes.
A quote from the video box: "A macho action fantasy... a provocative
revolutionary epic." -- Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times.
First of all, I can't believe anyone could say such things about this film.
Second, I dont even think it makes sense.
Christoper Walken sleeps through his role as a Vietnam POW, who eighteen
years later reteams with the soldiers who rescued him and they try to
liberate Colombia.  Michael Ironside also doesn't seem to try very hard in
his role as one of Walken's comrades.  My main problem here is that these two
actors are best known for being bad guys, and here they are supposed to be
action heroes.  I didn't buy it for a second.  Will they succeed in their
mission?  I wonder...
"McBain" is such a familiar retread on so many movie cliches, I question how
it can be provocative, revolutionary, or an epic.  Provocative means
"stimulating".  I was stimulated enough to fast forward through most of the
film.  Revolutionary means "drastically different".  Come on, this is every
episode of "The A Team".  And epic?  Please.  "The Longest Day" is an epic.
"McBain" is just a waste of time.
