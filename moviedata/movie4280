In Folks, Tom Selleck has to travel to Florida to admit his mother into a
hospital for an operation. There he discovers that his father (Ameche) is
rapidly losing his mind. After their trailer burns down, Selleck takes his
parents back home with him. Soon after, he loses his job, his car, his
furniture, his apartment, and his wife and kids leave him. Sounds like an
engaging drama about family and Alzheimer's disease right? Wrong, it's a
comedy. An attempted one anyway.
In the first ten minutes, Folks establishes itself as a wacky physical
comedy. Then we meet Selleck's dad (who we're told has something like Senior
Senility Disorder Complex but don't be fooled, it's just a nice way to say
Alzheimer's) and now for some reason the writer can't decide whether or not
to write a comedy or a drama. We're supposed to feel sad when Ameche puts
his shorts on backwards, but minutes later we're supposed to laugh
hysterically when he drives his car backwards at about 90 miles per hour
almost killing half a dozen people. The whole next hour is just like that.
Then, the film takes a truly bizarre turn when Selleck's mother suggests
that Selleck should kill them in order to get the insurance money. Most
people would find this twist to be repulsive, but me and my sick, twisted
mind enjoyed it. We're talking dark, dark comedy here. If the writer could
had left out the social commentary about the elderly and just stuck to
comedy, Folks would have been one hilarious movie.
