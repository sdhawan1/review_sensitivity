GIRL, THE (ELTÁVOZOTT NAP) (director: Márta Mészáros; screenwriter:
Márta Mészáros; cinematographer: Tamas Somlo; cast: Kati Kovács
(Erzsebet Szonyi), Ádám Szirtes (Mr. Zsamboki), Teri Horváth (Mrs.
Zsamboki), Gábor Harsányi (Lajos Zsamboki), Zsuzsa Pálos (Mari), Gábor
Agárdi (Mr. Papolczai), Hung.-1968)
Those eyes on Erzsebet (Kati) tell all, as she stares steely eyed ahead,
unafraid of being alone in the world, daring anyone to look at her
directly. The 24-year-old factory worker in Budapest has been raised in
an orphanage and now wants to track down her real parents and find out
why they put her up for adoption.
She locates her mother, Mrs. Zsamboki (Horváth), and writes her a letter
asking permission to visit. She turns out to be a very fearful
old-fashioned peasant, wearing a black shawl as do the other older farm
ladies, who is anguishly telling her daughter that she wrote her back to
not visit. When her daughter, who can't stop looking at her, says that
she didn't get that letter, the mother says, tell the family you are my
niece. Life in this remote country village, called Varkut, is
oppressive, with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch
bland TV programs. She lives with her husband and young adult son and
with her husband's mother, and feels very uncomfortable having this
pretty city girl as a guest, who only has eyes for the mother who keeps
rejecting her. The talk between mother and daughter never materializes,
as Erzsebet finds the week-end spent here to be draining, realizing that
there is nothing more to say or do here. She steals away from the house
at night, without even a good-bye, after attending a local dance with
the family, which seemed to convince her that she didn't fit in here.
This is a place for the older generation to wile away their time, even
the son told her he wants to leave for the city, to be in a place with
more action.
On the train back, she meets the same guy who tried to pick her up
before, when she refused to talk to him on the train ride to visit her
mother. But now she changes her mind and accepts his offer to stay the
night with him. There is no passion in her lovemaking, but the guy has
fallen for her, anyway. There is a coldness and distance about her, that
speaks ill of Hungarian society and its lack of warmth. When she visits
him again, she refuses his offer to be a serious couple by telling him
that she doesn't love him. The fierce B/W camera work captures the look
of devastation on his face.
When followed by a teen-ager, who tries to pick her up, she tells him to
jump off the bridge, which he does. All that gets him, is that she pays
his fine when the police ticket him for swimming unlawfully. Her beauty
and aloofness attracts men, but she can't let go of what is bothering
her, so she has nothing to give.
In Budapest we observe her working at her secure monotonous factory job,
a job that she doesn't complain about, but thinks about often, as well
as thinking about herself. The oppression is so great, that it is not
even overtly mentioned, it is just taken for granted.
An aggressive man approaches her at work, telling her he has some news
about her parents and would like to talk to her in a restaurant. She
ends up paying for his meal and cognacs, and realizes that he is her
downtrodden father, ashamed of himself, who can't even be straight with
her about who he is and has to make up a bogus story about her parents.
She has found out what she has to know about herself; what will become
of her is hard to say. But it is not pity that she needs, nor is it love
that she can find or thinks she needs. This first feature-length
directorial effort of Mészáros is staggering emotionally. Its heartfelt
dramatics and sparse dialogue, help make it a film of great quality and
integrity. There is no soft pedaling of reality to spare the orphan's
feelings. She just has to continue facing what is reality, there are no
other escapes. The world she lives in, is too bleak for happy music and
dreams...Márta Mészáros, the director, is the wife of renowned Hungarian
director Miklos Jancso.
