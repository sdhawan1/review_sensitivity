 Runaway Bride (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Roberts, Richard
Gere and Joan Cusack. Directed by Garry Marshall.
 "Runaway Bride" is nothing more than a cynical device to reteam Julia
Roberts and Richard Gere and capitalize on the magic they created a decade
ago with "Pretty Woman."
 "Runaway Bride" is so contrived, so phony, that only the star power of
Roberts and Gere manage to make it salvageable.
 The story is preposterous, totally fluff. A young woman, Maggie (Roberts),
continually leaves men at the altar. A columnist for "USA Today" (Gere)
takes her to task and, because his column contained some inaccuracies, he
is fired.
 Gere's Ike then finagles a free-lance assignment to travel to Maggie's
rural Maryland town and dig up some dirt on her by checking with residents
who will talk with him, including the skittish bride, as well as her jilted
grooms.
 The movie is rather tame. The premise has all the makings of one of those
classic screwball comedies from the 1930s. Irene Dunne, Barbara Stanwyck or
Jean Arthur would have been perfect for the bride, while Henry Fonda, Jimmy
Cagney or Jimmy Stewart would have fit snugly into the columnist's shoes.
 Unfortunately, the "Runaway Bride" script does not utilize the outlandish
possibilities of the situation to its comic potential. It tries to be more
romance than comedy, and is too tame, too sedate.
 Which is too bad, since it has the prime ingredient needed for a
successful screwball comedy recipe - a cast of strong supporting actors.
But director Garry Marshall doesn't seem to take advantage of many of these
performers - except for the incomparable Joan Cusack as Maggie's best
friend.
 Cusack is a treasure, a talented performer who adds luster to any film in
which she appears. She was the bright spot in the disappointing "Arlington
Road," and here she helps elevate the humor above what seems indicated in
the script.
 Gere and Roberts are magical. The chemistry between them is still there.
Yet it seems like such wasted potential because everything seems so
predictable, so by-the-numbers.
 True, the movie offers several laughs, but it seems "Runaway Bride" has to
strain for them instead of allowing them to flow naturally.
 "Runaway Bride" is a pastiche, a movie that seems cobbled together from
bits and pieces of other works. Fans of Roberts and Gere probably will
enjoy it - but even they are not enough to sustain this weighted effort.

        Nine years after they first struck Hollywood gold together in
"Pretty Woman," Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have teamed up again with
director Garry Marshall.  Whereas many will be thrilled to see the two
stars back together in "Runaway Bride," some will quickly realize that the
most creative aspect of the film was the decision to reunite Roberts and
Gere.  Everything else plays like an afterthought.
        The wafer-thin plot involves "USA Today" columnist Ike Graham
(Gere) hearing of a woman famous for leaving men at the altar (three to
date and counting).  Intrigued and desperate for copy, Ike heads on down to
Hale, Maryland to interview Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), and winds up
falling in love with her.
        Unfortunately, it's missing two critical ingredients: romance and
comedy.  OK, so I admit that this isn't my genre, but the comedy is trite,
forced, and highly unoriginal, and as for the romance?  Well...  Roberts is
engaging, she almost always is, but Gere is smug and full of himself.
There's a scene in "Playing by Heart," an ensemble piece from earlier this
year, in which Sean Connery humiliates himself by impersonating an
excitable puppydog.  Gere, it appears, was taking pointers.
        The occasionally competent actor (or the screenwriters--probably
both) goes out of his way to be cute in "Runaway Bride."  Whether it's
having his graying hair dyed all the colors of the rainbow, or providing
whimsical voiceovers for cake decorations, or clowning around in a field
like a drunken scarecrow to avoid "snakes," Gere relies on oafish physical
comedy rather than witty or sophisticated dialogue.  In fact, in "Runaway
Bride," Gere approximates a male version of Laurie Metcalf, who used to be
witty and sophisticated on "Rosanne," and is now oafish and physical on
"The Norm Show."  Metcalf puts in an appearance in "Runaway Bride" (as Mrs.
Trout the baker) and she's about as welcome as the horribly corny songs on
the soundtrack (Hall & Oates' "Maneater," for example).
        Not all of the performers disappoint, however.  Joan Cusack, as
Maggie's friend Peggy Flemming ("not the ice skater"), nails her role
delightfully, and unfortunate husband-to-be number four is given a charming
naďveté by Christopher Meloni.  Hector Elizondo, on the other hand, who
co-starred with Gere and Roberts in "Pretty Woman," seems to have followed
Gere's lead in "Runaway Bride" by staying up nights studying "How To Be
Full of Yourself For Dummies."
        Not content with being only sporadically funny and peripherally
romantic, the film takes "important" time out to make some serious asides,
such as portraying Maggie's father (Paul Dooley, who if nothing else gets
to show off his juggling skills) as a struggling alcoholic.  All this does
is dilute a plotline that is already heavily watered down.  How about this
for an alternative characterization: Maggie's dad is, wait for it, *not* a
struggling alcoholic!
        I am not such a confirmed curmudgeon that I couldn't smile from
time to time, or find the relationship between Ike and Maggie appealing on
some "what else is there in this picture to get excited about anyway?"
level.  But "Runaway Bride" is, by anyone's standards, a marketing strategy
first and a cute and funny movie second, and in that regard it--like the
hippie, the priest, and the aristocrat all abandoned by Maggie--should have
been left at the altar.

RUNAWAY BRIDE (PG).  
(Paramount/Touchstone/Buena Vista International)
Director: Garry Marshall
Stars: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Joan Cusack, Hector Elizondo,
Rita Wilson, Christopher Meloni, Paul Dooley, Jean Schertler,
Jane Morris, Laurie Metcalf (uncredited), Larry Miller (uncredited)
Running time: 116 minutes.
The chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts propelled
Pretty Woman, a contemporary reworking of the Pygmalion story, to the
top of the box office in 1990.  The pair are reunited with director
Garry Marshall for the belated follow up, Runaway Bride, a film so
light weight that it is in danger of floating away.  However, the
obvious charisma and magic between the pair again works a treat, and
lifts the formulaic material.  Runaway Bride delivers laughs and charm
in equal measure, and provides more than enough to satisfy audiences.
This delightfully charming if improbable romantic comedy will be
another runaway hit at the box office.
Ike Graham (Gere) is a New York columnist with a cynical and
misogynist outlook that earns him the ire of his readers.  Suffering
from writer's block with the deadline for his column only hours away,
he nurses his sorrows in a neighbourhood bar.  There he hears the
story of a serial runaway bride who has a habit of leaving her
potential husbands at the altar.  Graham writes the story without
checking the facts, and is promptly fired.  Still intrigued by the
story he heads off to picturesque Hale, in upstate Maryland, hoping to
gain vindication.
Maggie (Roberts) is deep in preparation for her fourth wedding
attempt.  This time her fiancé is the town's football coach
(Christopher Meloni).  Graham decides to follow Maggie around, hoping
to understand her fear of marriage.  The prickly animosity between the
mismatched pair slowly melts and gives way to romance as they realise
they have more in common than they care to admit.  The plot from this
point is fairly trite and predictable.
There is more of a slap stick sensibility to this film, and
the two stars throw themselves into their roles with an obvious
enthusiasm and relish.  The eccentric townsfolk are treated as little
more than stereotypes - the alcoholic father (Paul Dooley), the foul
mouthed octogenarian (Jean Schertler), and the man hungry widow (an
uncredited Laurie Metcalf) - although the dependable Joan Cusack makes
the most of her role as Peggy, Maggie's understanding best friend.
Chicago Hope star Hector Elizondo, who has appeared in all ten of
Marshall's previous films, gets some of the best lines, which he
delivers in superbly droll fashion.
Marshall's direction is uninspired, but the chemistry between
the two stars makes this innocuous souffle worth watching.  This is
the sort of thing that Roberts does best.  My Best Friend's Wedding,
Notting Hill, and now Runaway Bride have re-established her as the
queen of Hollywood romantic comedies.

Directed by Garry Marshall. Starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. What
first comes to mind when hearing those names is Pretty Woman. So, you'll
probably think it's Pretty Woman part 2. Well it's not, because this time
Julia Roberts isn't playing a prostitute but a country girl. The rest is
pretty much the same. What else do you expect?
The opening scene was Julia Roberts riding a horse, very fast, with her
wedding dress, while U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. From
the movie title, Runaway Bride, with that song (which Bono wrote about
God/religion, not about love!) you can guess. Julia Roberts is a Runaway
Bride.
The story: Ike Graham (Richard Gere) is a columnist for USA Today in New
York. That day he decided to write about man-eaters, if you know Hall &
Oates' song, after hearing some guy's story. And the victim is Maggie
Carpenter, a local girl from Hale, Maryland, who ditched her guys 3 times at
the altar. Maggie sends a complaining letter to the editor and Ike is out of
his job. But he doesn't give up. He goes to Hale to find out the truth about
Maggie, who is planning to give it a fourth try. So the story continues, and
you'll probably already knew the ending after 15 minutes.
For Julia Roberts, after she starred in Notting Hill, I was rather hoping to
see her in a better movie. Something like Conspiracy Theory. And Gere
shouldn't lower his level to this Pretty Woman-level again. But they did.
They probably did a good job in Runaway Bride, but the story was lousy. It
was a typical Hollywood story. I think Adam Sandler did a better version in
The Wedding Singer.
There was one time when I really laughed, and that was the part when they
were showing the crowd in the church for the wedding. Half of the church
filled with local Hale people, while the other half was filled with New
Yorkers, complete with their suits, sunglasses, and mobile phones. And a
joke about FedEx. But that's about it.
My last words, if you are planning to relax and get some laughs without even
thinking you can watch this movie. But if you prefer a real movie, don't go
to this one.

Cast: Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Joan Cusack, Paul Dooley, Rita Wilson,

1999 - 116 minutes.
Rated PG (for mild profanity).

1990's "Pretty Woman" became the most popular romantic comedy of all time not 
only because of the unmistakable chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia 
Roberts, but because of the surprising charm and innocence that it also 
possessed. It may not have been groundbreakingly original (and it wasn't), 
but it ably carried itself purely on the intelligence of the actors and 
screenplay. Over nine years have passed now, and although Roberts and Gere 
are a little bit older, they unfortunately aren't quite as wise in their 
project choices, as proven by their sophomore reunion with director Garry 
Marshall. Unlike "Pretty Woman," "Runaway Bride" constantly feels like a 
phony, artificially manufactured excuse just to get the two actors together 
once again. Apparently, the importance of the writing and story weren't at 
the top of everyone's minds when they decided to take on this lackluster 
endeavor.
Ike Graham (Richard Gere) is a once-divorced columnist for the USA Today who 
happens to be working for his ex-wife (Rita Wilson). Searching for a 
revitalizing, interesting story to write about, Ike is told by one of his 
buddies that there is a young lady in the small rural town of Hale, Maryland, 
who likes to dump grooms on their wedding day and run away. When the article 
finally is written, that woman, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts), who doesn't 
purposefully hurt her fiances as much as she has trouble committing herself 
for a lifetime with one certain person, is humiliated and outraged. Writing a 
letter to the editor of the USA Today spotting fifteen--count 'em, 
15!--factual errors, Ike is promptly fired for turning the paper into 
basically a tabloid. Fortunately, his best friend, Fisher (Hector Elizondo), 
comes up with a sure-fire way to save Ike's job: you see, Maggie is planning 
to get married in a week or two (her fourth attempt) with Bob (Christopher 
Meloni), a football coach and fitness nut, and if she once again backs out at 
the last minute, Ike's theory that he wrote in the paper will be confirmed.
When Ike arrives in Hale ("I think I'm in Mayberry!"), a quaint, 
old-fashioned kind of town, he gets a room at the motel in the town square 
and starts to pursue and question Maggie, a misunderstood woman who works at 
the local hardware store and is the butt of many "harmless" jokes with the 
townspeople (all of which know each other by name). At first despising the 
head-strong, determined Ike, she finally agrees for him to follow her around 
to see what makes her tick--for a sizable fee, of course, which must be a 
rip-off/ode to "Pretty Woman," where Gere payed Roberts (playing a 
prostitute) to spend six days with him while in L.A. Since Ike and Maggie are 
spending all of their time together, they start to get to know one another to 
the point that marriage with Ike sounds more appealing than marriage with 
Bob. But even if they go through with it, who is to say Maggie won't run 
again?
"Runaway Bride" lacks the smarts, wit, and spontaneity that the best romantic 
comedies have (just recently, the other Julia Roberts-starrer of the summer, 
"Notting Hill," had this). Simply put, this new film is stuck on auto-pilot, 
and therefore, comes off as a tiresome excursion into terrain that has been 
covered too many times to count. For one, you know going in that director 
Garry Marshall wouldn't dare make a movie with these two actors and not have 
them get together by the final act, so there is nary an ounce of suspense or 
interest generated from this major aspect of the story. To shake things up a 
little, Marshall and screenwriters Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott should 
have went a similar route as Roberts' sweet 1997 career-revitalizing hit, "My 
Best Friend's Wedding," which had an upbeat resolution that was nonetheless 
more truthful and complicated than by just having the two romantic leads get 
together. Perhaps Marshall feared that audiences would get upset if Roberts 
and Gere didn't live happily ever after at the end, but it, no doubt, would 
have at least added a sprinkle of originality that is hopelessly absent from 
almost every scene in the overlong 116-minute running time. And that's 
another thing; the film may actually have worked on a minor level had it 
concluded with its natural ending, but instead, it proceeds to go on for 
another unnecessary fifteen minutes.
Once again, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere shine in their latest foray, but 
the romantic heat between the two that was so tangible in "Pretty Woman" 
isn't present nearly as much here, most likely because the writing, as 
mentioned, isn't as satisfying. Their roles of Ike and Maggie also happen to 
be the least interesting characters in the whole film, which is a glaring 
flaw that looms overhead most of the picture. No fault of Roberts and Gere, 
especially, who seems far more loose and care-free than I think I've ever 
seen him on film, but every time one of the supporting players would appear 
on-screen, things would brighten up considerably.
Joan Cusack, as always, is a comic delight and standout as Maggie's best 
friend and hairstylist at the "Curl Up and Dye" Salon (which, yes, garnered a 
big laugh). Cusack is not really wasted, particularly since she and Roberts 
have a subtle, honest scene together, but it is rather frustrating to 
constantly see Cusack, one of America's biggest current acting talents, cast 
in the "friend" role. Studio heads, take note: Give Cusack the lead in a 
movie, for once. Believe me, she has proven her worth and is fully capable of 
holding up a picture on her own. Why don't other people see this? 
One compliment that probably should be given to the screenwriters is in the 
three-dimensional treatment given to the ex-wife character of Gere's, played 
by Rita Wilson in a memorable, superior performance to anything I've seen her 
in. Too often overacting or missing the mark (see her disappointing work in 
1998's remake of "Psycho"), Wilson is perfect here as a woman who still cares 
for Gere, despite their divorce and avoidance to what went wrong with their 
marriage, and is able to have a warm, loving relationship with him. Of the 
other supporting actors, Hector Elizondo is not used nearly as well or 
effectively as he was in "Pretty Woman" and is given very little to do, while 
Laurie Metcalf is hilarious in her too-brief performance as the town baker, 
as is Jean Schertler as Roberts' lovable, if brazen, granny.
When you go to see a movie that features megastars Julia Roberts and Richard 
Gere and, yet, you mostly want them to disappear into the background so you 
can watch the people around them strut their stuff, what exactly does that 
tell you? In my opinion, it tells you that the screenplay needed an extensive 
rewrite to strengthen the two lead characters, who aren't nearly as flashy 
and absorbing as Cusack, Wilson, Metcalf, and Schertler. When Roberts and 
Gere finally do come together in the last scene, you are happy for them, but 
left with an uncertain feeling inside. If Roberts' Maggie really does have a 
lot of personal problems to work out, then how can you be so sure that she 
and Ike won't be making a trip to divorce court a week later? Or, better yet, 
and it is this plot contrivance that is the most difficult to swallow, why 
would Maggie be smitten with Ike in the second half when she thoroughly can't 
stand him in the former section because of the cruel things he wrote about 
her, in a country-wide newspaper, no less? Regretfully, "Runaway Bride" too 
often appears to be so concerned with big box-office receipts that everyone 
involved forgot about making the film actually good. Sorry, Julia, but don't 
worry, I still love ya! On second thought, who couldn't?

Some studio executive must have been comfortably reclining back in his
office chair with his feet planted on his desk thinking about what the
next great movie project will be.  This executive is probably a
last-minute doer.  And just before the deadline hits, he snaps his
finger and says aha', as if an idea so clever entered his mind that he
rushes forth convinced that he has a winner.  This idea was to reunite
the winning team that brought us the wonderful 1990 fairy tale, Pretty
Woman.  With Director Gary Marshall again at the helm, Julia Robert's
radiant smile, and Richard Gere's good looks, how can this miss?  Well
Gere plays Ike Graham, a columnist for USA Today who seems to approach
his job much like the aforementioned studio executive.  With a deadline
fast approaching, he sips his drink at the local watering hole trying
to come up with his latest article.  Graham's column is accused of
being laced with bitter diatribes of the opposite sex, and is the
target of many a hate mail from his female readers.  Even little old
ladies come up to him and hit him with rolled up newspapers.  At the
bar, he meets a person who tells him of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a
serial fiancée who seems to live for nothing other than pulling the
heartstrings of men and then leaving them at the altar.  Like the
studio executive, Ike is so convinced that this idea is a winner that
he rushes forth with this article without even checking the facts. 
Maggie writes a bitter note to Ike's editor (Rita Wilson), and he is
subsequently fired.  Ike's best friend (Hector Elizondo) tells him to
go do some personal research on the matter to get his job and his
reputation back.  Is she really as bad as they say?
So, now he's off to picturesque Hale, MD to determine the truth of
Maggie Carpenter.  Maggie is completely flustered by his presence,
especially in light of her impending fourth upcoming wedding attempt to
Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni).  She does his best to brush him off,
but Ike is not so easily dissuaded.  And before you know it, he's
making friends with Maggie's sottish but likeable dad, her spirited
grandma, and her best friend, played by Joan Cusack.  Despite their
initial dislike for one another, they seem to have an understanding for
one another.  After questioning her former jilted fiancés, he realizes
that it's not because she's a mean-spirited person.  Rather, it's
because she just doesn't know what she wants and fears that she'll
never find true love if she marries first.  Ike, to no surprise, has
similar problems. Their commonalties and ongoing bickering eventually
evolves into attraction for one another.  This is the kind of story
where the audience knows what will happen way before Ike and Maggie do.
 Sure, there's a minor crisis here, and the revelation that accompanies
it, but the story is as predictable as the steps of the Macarena.
I guess that I so moved by Pretty Woman because it was a movie that was
so 
Cinderella-esque.  How could anything like that happen in real life? 
It was implausible, but I loved it.  And to that point, I also have
greater praise for Robert's earlier summer release, Notting Hill for
that same reason.  This movie fails to generate the magic and warmth
that it promised to be.  Yes, Roberts and Gere have good chemistry, and
they are both good to look at.  But without their star power, the
studio moguls when deciding to make this picture probably wouldn't have
said I do.'

Galloping onto the screen, a bride in full gown rides horseback through a
field of tall grass accompanied by U2's "Still haven't found what I'm
looking for." "Runaway Bride" puts a strong hoof forward and never looks
back. It's a film full of solid, polished dialogue with a great premise, a
clinch cast and veteran director. It won't leave you sobbing at the altar.
New York columnist Ike Graham, infamous for his commentaries on the female
of the species, writes a shoddy article on small towner Maggie Carpenter
(Roberts) who has a knack for standing up grooms. Unlikely as it may seem,
Graham doesn't check up on the story, jumbles facts and uses her actual name
in the column. Carpenter writes back to the editor and Graham is canned.
Seeking vengeance, he heads to Hale, Maryland to get the real story as
Maggie makes her fourth attempt at the altar.
In my favorite scene, Gere shadows Roberts into a bakery where she is
choosing bride/groom figures for the cake. Gere picks up the three inch
bride whacking the little groom over the head with it, "Bam Bam Bam! Yeah,
this one's Maggie all right."
Like Robert's recent "Notting Hill," it's a sure bet.
Starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.
Directed by Garry Marshall.
Screenplay by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott.
Produced by Ted Field and Tom Rosenberg at Touchstone/Paramount.
Rated PG.

 Ever since "Pretty Woman," Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, and
director Garry Marshall have been looking for another project, and
this screwball romantic fantasy seems to fit the bill. No, it's not a
sequel. It's an entirely different story. Roberts plays Maggie, a
small-town charmer who has left three grooms at the altar - a fact
that is exaggerated in USA TODAY by a cynical New York columnist, Ike
Graham (think Jimmy Breslin) - that's Gere - who bitterly dubs her a
"man-eater." She complains to his editor (Rita Wilson), who is also
his ex-wife, citing just cause for a defamation lawsuit. He promptly
gets fired for exploitive journalism. Determined to vindicate himself
and uncover the "real story" for GQ magazine, Ike shows up in bucolic
Hale, Maryland, just as Maggie is preparing to marry groom #4, the
high-school physical education teacher/coach.  "Shazam! It's
Mayberry," he mutters just before the barbershop quartet starts.
Ike's acerbic; Maggie's defensive. They spar and spat with incredible
finesse. But will she bolt once more?  No one knows, even her widower
father (Paul Dooley) who notes, "Maggie may not be Hale's longest
running joke, but she's certainly the fastest."  Eventually, Maggie
realizes "there's a distinct possibility that I'm profoundly,
irreversibly screwed-up." The screenplay by Josann McGibbon, Sara
Parriott, and Audrey Wells leaves little doubt in your mind about the
outcome but it's deliciously amusing getting there. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Runaway Bride" is a glowing, breezy 8. It's
not as quirky and witty as "Notting Hill," Roberts' most recent
romantic comedy, and not in the same league as "Pretty Woman." But
Gere's glossy and gorgeous, and it's flirty, feel-good fun from
beginning to end - a date movie or chick's flick.

Hines, Donal Logue, Christopher Meloni, Sandra Taylor.
   With "Runaway Bride" and "Deep Blue Sea" opening at
about the same time across the country, the screens
will be flooded and running off with the usual summer cliches. 
"Deep Blue Sea" has the typical trajectory of its genre:
human creates peaceful-enough monster, monster becomes
agitated and eats humans, humans blow up monster. 
"Runaway Bride," more a romantic than an aquatic horror,
fills the blanks: woman dislikes man, woman gets to like man,
events conspire to keep them apart, woman and man get
together.  
   Julia Roberts--the principal audience attraction for the
event--tries heartily to make up for the inanity of her recent
role in "Notting Hill."  While she has no clunkers to equal "I'm
just a girl looking at a boy asking him to lover her," her
colloquy conveys no great revelations here, though to the
credit of the three scripters, this sitcom has the customary
array of sharp one-liners.  Director Garry Marshall would
have done well to cut the last fifteen minutes not simply to
reduce the time (the movie is not overlong) but to end the
show at just the right moment, as the runaway bride jumps on
the FedEx truck.  The curtain could have appropriately come
down when one wag in the wedding party clucks, "I don't
know where she's going, but wherever it is, she'll be there at
10.30 tomorrow morning."  
   Like "Notting Hill," which could be taken as a thinly veiled
sketch of Julia Roberts' own fame, "Runaway Bride" has
some resonance in the mega-star's life.  In 1991 she was
scheduled to marry Kiefer Sutherland but backed out at the
last moment, at which point she began a romantic interlude
with Jason Patric.  Recanting an engagement is not so
unusual: bolting at an actual wedding party just before the
taking of vows is (although many of us could probably
recount tales of people who did just that, using their cold feet
to head for the hills at the very moment the guests are
seated).  "Runaway Bride" is about a woman who is notorious
in her little town of Hale, Maryland for leaving three men
literally at the altar. She is about to become nationally famous
as acerbic regular columnist Ike Graham (Richard Gere)
writes a biting column in USA Today about this "man-eater." 
When the titled character, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts),
dashes off a letter to the editor listing specific inaccuracies in
the commentary and hinting a lawsuit for defamation, Graham
is fired by the editor, who is also his ex-wife (Rita Wilson). 
Given a chance to regain his national reputation by writing a
cover-story interview with Maggie for GQ magazine, Ike
leaves New York for the Maryland sticks to get the scoop. 
Approaching Maggie--who already dislikes the man for his
column and is irritated by his chutzpah in coming to the town-
-he ingratiates himself with everyone including, ultimately, his
subject, whom he defends against the snide cutthroats of her
own town who roast her repeatedly.
   Here is just another one of those movies that the most tired
businessman rained out of his weekend trip to the Hamptons
stays way ahead of.  The characters are all predictable: the
would-be bride's grandma whose psychoanalyzes Maggie's
problem as her being simply an innocent woman afraid of the
"one-eyed snake" she will inevitably encounter on her
wedding night.  Paul Dooley is the lovably curmudgeon of a
small-town dad who gets thoroughly drunk on weekends
(understandable since he lost his own wife) and who jokes
throughout about the money he shelled out for three aborted
nuptials.  But as Maggie's best friend Peggy, Joan Cusack
stands out as the picture's queen of the quip, alternately
chiding her pal and being her main support.
   Hale, Maryland could be the sort of cute American location
that would indeed have a beauty parlor called the Curl and
Dye and whose beauticians and nail technicians would
crumple at the first site of the hotshot city slicker columnist. 
Yet there's something downright condescending about
portraying these rubes as suckers for Ike's attentions and
manipulations, even the little leaguers looking starry-eyed at
the big man from the Big Apple.  
   Richard Gere, often disparaged for projecting little more
than ennui, is particularly assertive in his role of the guy who
will save the pretty woman from the likes of her current
fiance, an athletic coach who patronizingly teaches Maggie to
focus on him just as he trains the kids on the diamond to
focus on the ball.  None of these small-town specimens can
match Ike's urban charm ("I guarantee we'll have a tough
time" is his winningly realistic way of proposing marriage) or
his ability to analyze Maggie's problem--having no mind of
her own.  
   Ironically both agree that "attraction is often mistaken for
rightness and attraction does not mean anything," and yet the
two, who know each other for a week, fall into each other's
arms on the basis of attraction alone.  While the hackneyed
dialogue that swims throughout the entire film is flaw enough,
the feel-good ending drowns the show thoroughly.

     Like a pair of former lovers trying to stir up the embers of a
dead affair, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are together again, but
the magic that lit the screen in Garry Marshall's surprise 1990 hit
"Pretty Woman" is dead, and there's no bringing it back to life.
"Runaway Bride" is a calculated, empty shakedown of audiences
yearning for another round of the fairytale charm that made a
superstar of Roberts a decade ago.  The original notion was to do
"Pretty Woman II", but the parties involved couldn't agree on a
formula, so they had to settle for a new story.  This time Gere's a
misogynistic journalist who hears a tale in a bar about a Maryland
woman (Roberts) who keeps leaving grooms at the altar.  Without
checking a single fact he writes an error-riddled, actionable diatribe
in his USA Today column, naming names.  To the veteran journalist's
amazement, this gets him fired.  His boss (Rita Wilson), who is also
his ex-wife, has to pull his plug, but her husband (Hector Elizondo),
who is also his pal, offers to get him a cover story in GQ if he can
get the skinny on the runaway bride.
He jumps at the offer -- media superstar though he is, he isn't
syndicated, and the USA Today column seems to be his only gig (by the
looks of his penthouse, it must pay well.)  Down he goes to Maryland,
where the townspeople, and even Julia's family , welcome him as if he
were Pat Sajak.  The only person who shows any resistance to his charm
is Roberts herself, but she comes around quicker than you might think.
The screenplay is peppered with comedy cliches, like the coach
who talks only in sports terms, and the horny grandma who says things
like "I like his tight butt," a line with echoes that Gere might have
preferred left alone.  Joan Cusack adds some life with her dependable
comic flair.  But neither Gere nor Roberts get characters written with
any reference to reality, and despite his silver hair and lean jaw,
and her incandescent smile, there's not much they can do with a
relationship so obviously constructed on the page rather than in the
heart.  This isn't chemistry, it's instant coffee.

Julia Roberts, America's favorite pretty woman, is back again with her
second romantic comedy of the summer, RUNAWAY BRIDE.
Teaming Roberts up again with Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall,
this movie, as everyone associated with it carefully points out, is not
a sequel to PRETTY WOMAN, the hit movie that started this decade.  But
who cares?  Gere and Roberts evidence enough genuine chemistry on the
screen to fill a dozen run-of-the-mill romances.
The plot this time concerns one Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a small-town
hardware store owner, who is described as "always a bride but never a
bridesmaid."  Maggie has vow phobia that causes her to flee from the
wedding ceremony before it comes time to say, "I do."  She's developed
quite a negative reputation for all of the fiancés that she has left
stranded.  As the newspaper puts it, "Hardware honey goes nuts and
bolts."
Upon hearing about her story, USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Gere)
prints an article about her that gets some of the key facts wrong --
she's only abandoned 3 grooms, not 6 -- and gets fired for his
journalistic sins.  Ike leaves the Big Apple for Maggie's hometown of
Hale to get the lowdown on her.  When he arrives, she's in the final
boarding stages of tying the knot with the local high school coach
(Christopher Meloni).  Grinning from ear to ear, Ike throws himself
heart and soul into becoming bosom buddies with all of Maggie's friends
and relatives so that he can learn the truth about her.
The script by Sara Parriott, Josann McGibbon and Audrey Wells is filled
with some nice one liners and several delightfully quirky characters.
As Peggy Fleming -- no, not that Peggy Fleming -- the owner of the "Curl
Up and Dye" beauty salon, Joan Cusack plays Maggie's long-time best
buddy and an unabashed weird character.
None however are more unusual than Maggie herself, whom we first see in
a satin wedding dress, riding at full gallop on a horse as she runs away
from a would-be husband.  The movie is filled with such well-constructed
sight gags.  Another has Maggie dragging the trainbearer behind her as
she dashes out of the church.  The poor little boy holds on for dear
life.
Roberts, with her glamorous looks, is so confident that she's willing to
look ugly in the service of comedy.  Pulling out her signature luscious
lips, she does an old "duckbill platypus" joke as a favor to Peggy.  The
surprise of the casting is that as lovely as Roberts is, Gere, with his
thick gray, wavy hair, manages to outshine her.  In fact, it is Gere,
not Roberts, who steals most of their scenes.  With a relaxed
savoir-faire, Gere gives himself a decided Cary Grant air.
Ike pokes around, trying to find out if Maggie will actually go through
with proposed wedding number four.  "Don't think they'll call it off, do
you?" he asks Maggie's father, Walter (Paul Dooley).  "Wedding cake
freezes, this we know," Walter replies.  Maggie is not only the town
joke, but also her family's.  "Maggie may not be Hale's longest running
joke, but she certainly is the fastest," her father claims.
Ike has his own battle scars.  A divorced man, he proudly proclaims,
"I'm a work in progress."  Still, he seems as sure of himself as Maggie
is unsure of herself.  Combatants at first, their relationship changes
over the course of the good-spirited film, much to the delight of the
audience.  The laughs tend to come batched together, causing viewers to
miss some delicious little zingers.  Oh well, you can catch them all
when you rent it later.
As we get down to the homestretch, the question is, will she or won't
she walk out on her upcoming wedding?  As she stands in her wedding
dress in front of a fan, she tries to cool herself down so that she will
not panic and abort the ceremony.  The one thing in which the audience
feels confident is that, whatever she chooses, the results will be
charming and humorous.  They will not be disappointed.
RUNAWAY BRIDE runs 1:55.  It is rated PG for language and some
suggestive dialogue and would be fine for kids around 8 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, loved the movie and gave it ***.  He thought it
was a little repetitious but had some good laughs that cracked him up.

Cast: Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Joan Cusack, Paul Dooley, Rita Wilson,
Hector Elizondo, Christopher Meloni, Jean Schertler, Laurie Metcalf
Maybe I was in a bad mood or maybe I have a thing against theaters with
rocking seats banging into my knees, but this contrived, by-the-numbers,
empty-calorie movie left me angry.  Oh, sure, I laughed a little, but after
the fifteenth strategic placement of a cute puppy or a set of adorable
twins, I began to feel something akin to hatred for this movie.
"The Runaway Bride" is the movie equivalent of a political campaign, trying
to make up for its lack of believable characters and ridiculous plot by
throwing in tried and true shots of cute things to keep the audience warm
and fuzzy.  It's as if Garry Marshall would shout, "THE AUDIENCE IS CATCHING
ON TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS CRAP!  THROW THEM A KITTY-CAT!" and the
audience, almost seeing behind the moldy green curtain within which the
studio wizards operate, is unable to react other than favorably to the
cotton-candy being lobbed at them.
Please understand that I like romantic fluff movies...I actually liked
"Pretty Woman," "Notting Hill" and "My Best Friend's Wedding," all fairly
successful attempts at ultra-lite romantic comedy.  "Pretty Woman," of
course, was directed by Garry Marshall, and had a nice, new touch to it.
Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are both decent actors, and can carry a
movie.  Joan Cusack is always good to have on hand to add some funny,
touching buoyancy to a dramatic moment.  Larry Miller is a funny comedian.
Laurie Metcalf was good on "Roseanne."
Was "The Runaway Bride" destined to be terrible?  I don't think so.  But,
for god sakes, Garry, after "Dear God," I would have thought you'd learned a
lesson about adding some complexity and mature interest to a film.  Like the
flagging comedy of "In & Out," this film tries to approach actual emotion
while using characters as synthetic as the stock on which the film was shot.
It used stylized, stereotyped situations and then tried to throw
Oscar-nominating speeches on top ("You humiliate me every time you take a
drink!").  "Bride" couldn't figure out its own tone and as a result never
approached the deep-felt humor of a good romantic-comedy.
Alas, it really doesn't matter what I think of this movie.  The producers
threw in something for everyone, and it'll make a lot of money.  I know that
much.

Imagine Joan Cusack as a weird, wild and wonderful woman with certain
insecurities about herself, living in a town not unlike Mayberry or
Pleasantville. She falls in love with an older reporter (Hector Elizondo) who
comes into town trying to verify rumors about a bride who runs from each and
every wedding opportunity, hence Cusack. Cusack falls for the old tiger, but
differences settle in about age difference, and she confides in a therapist
(Richard Gere) who is a bespectacled man with a mustache - somewhere within
this stiff she finds an attractive man if he would only shave that mustache and
remove the glasses. Unfortunately. Gere has an attractive sister (Julia
Roberts) who tries to protect him from her wooing. Naturally, Cusack ends up
with Elizondo but there is a sense of bitterness and sadness that she did not
end up with Gere. Alas, "Runaway Bride," although be warned that the plot
description I just offered is not the movie itself. This is simply something I
thought of while watching and trying to stay awake with this stale, laughless
stupidity of a movie.
In reality, Garry Marshall's latest romantic comedy confection stars Richard
Gere as "Ike" Graham, a columnist for the USA Today who has trouble coming up
with any fresh ideas. He resorts to going to the local bar and is inspired by a
patron who speaks of a "runaway bride," a woman who leaves men at the altar.
Almost immediately Ike writes the column based on the patron's testimony
(though this is never really made clear). Women on the street berate Ike and
hit him on the head with rolled-up newspapers before he discovers a snarling
letter from the bride herself printed by the editor. Apparently, Ike
misrepresented many facts and exaggerated many figures. He is fired by the
editor, his former wife (Rita Wilson). Now, Ike goes to this picture-postcard,
Mayberry-like town and confronts the snarling woman, Maggie Carpenter (Julia
Roberts). She is about to get married again, and Ike senses that she will run
like a rabbit again. Or will she succumb to Gere's charm and smooth-talking
demeanor? And is it possible that good romantic comedies are a thing of the
past?
Basically, the formula is set up for this movie, and all the cliches are in
place, and nothing else. This is one of the most charmless, dullest and
periodically dumbest movies I have ever seen. How can a respected director like
Marshall reduce Gere and Roberts to cardboard cutouts with about as much sex
and romantic appeal as a pair of refrigerators? Roberts is actually boring to
watch in this movie - her wide grins and "duckbill platypus" mugging is
unflattering to say the least. Gere seems more stiff than ever, and shares no
charisma or chemistry with Roberts. Interesting, considering what a solid pair
they were in "Pretty Woman," also directed by Marshall. I never understood the
latter's success but it had gobs of wit and real emotions unlike this scrap
heap. Nevertheless, Gere and Roberts felt like real people in that movie - here
they are sitcom variations.
While desperately trying to stay awake, I noticed a couple of nods to "Pretty
Woman," a cameo by Garry Marshall at a baseball game, and a video copy of "The
Graduate," one of my favorite comedies of all time. There also is one good line
about Fed-Ex trucks, and a couple of briefly delicious moments by the droll
Elizondo. Outside of that, this "Bride" is of little merit. Even the quirky
Joan Cusack (not weird as she is described by Roberts) is often excruciating.
Jean Schertler as Grandma supplies a couple of chuckles but nothing more. And
for trivia buffs, there is Julia's sister, Lisa Roberts, as "Elaine from
Manhattan" in one scene. 
Forget the silly "Pretty Woman," "Notting Hill," released earlier this year,
was one of the best films of Julia's career - she carried the film with grace
and subtlety and had the good sense of co-starring with the daffy Hugh Grant.
They had sweet chemistry and had a solidly good script to boot from "Four
Weddings and a Funeral" scribe, Richard Curtis. "Runaway Bride" has none of
those virtues and seems to have been made in a rush. My advice to Ms. Roberts
about future romantic comedies is to follow Lola's example: Run Julia Run!

Cranky CriticŽ movie reviews: Runaway Bride
Rated [PG-13]
Starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere
Screenplay by Sara Parriott & Josann McGibbon and Audrey Wells
Directed by Garry Marshall
website: http://www.runawaybride.com
Consider Runaway Bride the film equivalent of a ten year reunion of the
folks who made Pretty Woman (it's a couple of months short, but close
enough for rock n roll). Rather than retread old ground -- high-powered
successful businessman plays Prince Charming to a hard-working working
girl whose Chosen Profession would indicate a deep seated aversion to
commitment -- The Runaway Bride ups the stakes by making our principle
characters, a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist and the
hard-working woman he wrongs in his column, natural enemies.
Richard Gere is Ike Graham, whose problem meeting deadlines finally
brings him down when he runs with a storyline picked up at his local
bar. Target of the column, as usual, is a woman (Graham so irks his
femme readers that they all slap him on sight). Maggie Carpenter (Julia
Roberts), who lives in Hale, Maryland, has run from the altar at least
three times and her misadventures have made her the laughingstock of the
community. Thus the film title. Ike's ex-wife Ellie, also his editor at
USA Today (Rita Wilson), fires him when a letter from Maggie points out
seventeen factual inaccuracies in the column. Ellie's new husband Fisher
(Hector Elizondo), also Ike's best friend, finds an assignment for him
at another magazine, to cover Maggie's fourth attempt. If Maggie runs,
Ike is vindicated.
But when he hits town,  Maggie recognizes Ike. She and best friend Peggy
(Joan Cusack) do their best to humiliate and otherwise ignore the man,
who still manages to befriend almost everyone in town, including
Maggie's family and fiancee, Bob (Chris Meloni). The friendlier Ike
gets, the more frustrated Maggie gets, until she realizes it's just
better to cooperate with his research and  story and prove that, yes
indeedy, she can make the walk down the aisle without bolting for
freedom.
Which is where the star chemistry kicks in and I'll leave you hanging.
Face it folks,  you know how it's going to turn out, when all is said
and done. The part we all want to see is that moment when Gere and
Roberts look at each other and know this is it. Getting there is a
fairly average dateflick. That moment, when it arrives, is absolutely
perfect and electric.
But this flick ain't over. heh heh heh.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Runaway Bride, he would have
paid...
It's a date flick, and a pretty average one, until the star power kicks
in. From that point, things pick up mightily.

'Runaway Bride' is such a bad film that it's difficult to know where to
begin.  The poster for it certainly made it look like it was more interested
in showing the physical attributes of its stars rather than their talents.
Their smiles, their smirks, their way with each other that was all seen in
1990's 'Pretty Woman'.  The mismatched man and woman who dislike each other
at first but later fall in love in such an unconvincing manner that not only
is it an insult to the audiences intelligence but takes two very serious
subjects like prostitution (the background subject of 'Pretty Woman') and
libelous journalism ( the background subject of 'Runaway Bride') and sugar
coats them in a shameful manner.  If you're going to make a film like this,
why inflate it with such an overblown cast of characters who mean nothing to
the story except to the actors playing them as well as the people calling
the shots?
I think if you asked most movie audiences, they probably would have wanted
to see a sequel to 'Pretty Woman' nine years after the original with more
admirable qualities rather than another pairing of its two leading stars in
a movie with different material.  Look at 1997.  The cast of 1988's 'A Fish
Called Wanda' teamed up for 'Fierce Creatures' an abysmal attempt to go home
again and capture the magic of the original chemistry that 'Wanda' was able
to project.  Better yet, how about a prequel to 'Pretty Woman' showing how
the character's lives progressed into their eventual choices to make a
living and eventually meeting each other.  But no, director Garry Marshall
chooses to take his skill that has never really amounted to anything above
the level of television entertainment and make a movie that appeals only to
a certain audience and has very little to offer to anyone else.
In 'Runaway Bride', Gere plays Ike Graham, a journalist for USA Today who
writes a story that causes a firestorm of controversy.  His source, an
intoxicated guy in a bar, tells Ike that there's a woman in small-town
America named Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) who has developed a habit of
being a man-eater.  She has allegedly dumped several would be grooms at the
altar and earned the nick name "runaway bride" because she literally runs
away, bridal dress and all and one incident shows here managing to escape on
a horse at full charge.  After writing an anti-female article that knocks
Maggie at every turn, women rap Ike on the head with a copy of the newspaper
as he walks the big city streets and his editor and ex-wife (Rita Wilson)
fires him after she says that the stuff he wrote is "actionable" on the part
of its subject.  Determined to stand by his story win vindication for
himself and investigate Maggie herself, Ike travels to her small town and
encounters its culture with all of its people and, of course, Ike and Maggie
fall in love but do they stay together?  You'll have to see for yourself.
'Runaway Bride' had me wanting to scream in disgust at many of the obvious
phony scenes of a relationship that is not in the least bit convincing and
its climax which involves the news of how the two leads lives turn out for
the moment, has all of the films characters receiving the news one way or
the other and projecting their reaction to it like you would react to a plot
twist in your favourite soap opera.  To further complicate things, there are
even some in-jokes about 'Pretty Woman' which aren't even funny.
The most manipulative film in the last ten years is 1989's 'Dead Poets
Society' which saved itself by giving the audience an original story to fall
back on and the outcome was both believable and flowed naturally and didn't
look manufactured.  When a film can manipulate its audience and disguise it
as genuine entertainment, it's still sort of a cheat but at least it can
make up for its shortcomings by injecting a sense of convincing traits.  The
manipulation here is both obvious with no redeeming qualities and a style
similar to fast food which is digested quickly and forgotten even faster.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The scariest film to take place in Maryland this year isn't The Blair
Witch Project  it's the paint-by-numbers re-teaming of Pretty Woman
director Garry Marshall and stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.  Here,
in Marshall's second directorial dud of the year (The Other Sister was
equally unimaginative), Gere's triumphant acting style that made Red
Corner a box office smash remains unchanged, while Roberts conjures up
memories of debacles past, just about erasing any memory of her fine
performance in Notting Hill.
The tired story begins when a jaded USA Today columnist named Ike Graham
(Gere) writes a piece after hearing a barroom tale about a small-town
girl named Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a woman who purportedly left
seven beaux at the altar by dashing out of the ceremonies `like the
running of the bulls in Pamplona.'  The trouble is that Ike never
checked his source and is immediately canned by Ellie, his
editor-in-chief (and ex-wife) played by Mrs. Tom Hanks/Rita Wilson
(Psycho).  Out of work, Ike is persuaded by Ellie's husband,
photographer Fisher (Hector Elizondo, Chicago Hope, doing his best
impression of `Kristof' from The Truman Show) to actually investigate
the `runaway bride' story in the hopes of selling his narrative to the
highest bidder and, verily, jumpstarting his career.
When Ike arrives in Hale, Maryland, he quickly discovers that Maggie has
only really ditched three grooms on their wedding day, but she is still
the running joke of the town.  Her drunk pop (Paul Dooley, Telling Lies
in America) even aims a few zingers at his only child, adding that
`wedding cake freezes  this we know.'  Ike tries to track Maggie down
at the family hardware store that she runs (Carpenter - hardware store -
get it?), but she's off at the local beauty salon, run by best friend
Peggy (Joan Cusack, In & Out and perennial
funny-enough-to-be-a-sidekick-but-not-attractive-enough-by-Hollywood-standards-to-be-a-romantic-lead.
Why can't her agent find her a script like Muriel's Wedding?).  Maggie
agrees to talk to Ike, but only if she and Peggy can `wash' his hair.
Stupidly, he agrees, and ends up looking like that guy with the rainbow
wig and the `John 3:16' sign that is always at pro football games.  Yup,
we're talking pretty high-brow humor here.
After speaking to most of the townsfolk, Ike learns that Maggie's first
victim is a burnt-out Deadhead who still works in town as a mechanic.
Patsy #2 (Donal Logue) has become the local priest, while the third dupe
is a boozehound in New York City.  Remarkably, there is yet a fourth man
ready to by discarded by galloping Maggie - uni-browed high school
athletic coach Bob (Christopher Meloni from HBO's wonderful OZ).  Now,
I'm not going to say who Maggie eventually marries, but you will
definitely be surprisedif you've never seen a movie before in your
life.  The story is so remarkably predictable that even the
simplest-minded will see the placement of the Hall & Oates song
`Maneater' coming from very far away.
Could the problem be with Marshall's direction?  He hasn't done anything
worthwhile since his television trilogy (Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley
and Mork & Mindy).  Could it be novice screenwriters Sara Parriott,
Josann McGibbon and Audrey Wells?  Could this have come from anywhere
but the minds of three women?  There are a few decent lines, mostly from
Elizondo and Cusack, the latter of whom is so wasted in this role, but
not nearly as misused as Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne) who plays the local
baker for all of about 90 seconds.  I am still amazed that there was so
little packed into a film that ran so long.  Hello, Hollywood?  Romantic
comedies are supposed to be 90 minutes long - 100 if Kevin Smith is
involved.  (1:51 - PG for language and some suggestive dialogue)

Starring Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Christopher Meloni, Joan Cusack.
Rated PG.
If I had to name the most common problems with 90's romantic comedies,
at the top of the list would be their inherent implausibility. How and
why the characters fall in love is barely ever explained; instead we are
expected to trust the old Love at First Sight/I Know She Is the One for
Me explanation. Sometimes we aren't given any explanation at all: one
scene has the soon-to-be couple bickering, fighting and hating each
other and then -- boom -- in the next scene they are passionately
kissing.
The reason I warmed up to the new Julia Roberts vehicle, none-too-subtly
monikered The Runaway Bride, is that it avoids that most common and most
frustrating of problems. This is a film that does not ask us to take a
gargantuan leap into suspension of disbelief in order for us to accept
its premise. It works not only as a comedy but also as a love story; a
compelling romance between two people that have a believable future
together.
The Runaway Bride reunites the Pretty Woman dream-team of Julia Roberts
and Richard Gere. The latter plays Ike Graham, a much-maligned USA Today
newspaper columnist who allegedly writes nothing but "bitter diatribes"
about women. Sitting in his favorite bar one day he gets a tip-off of
sorts from a fellow sitting next to him: there is a girl in his
hometown, he says, who is legendary for ditching grooms at the altar.
Ike loves it and decides to write about it. His damning mistake was
exaggerating, turning a potentially interesting article into a -- who'd
have guessed it -- a bitter diatribe about women and a lie at that.
Maggie Carpenter, the subject of Ike's column/tirade, happens to pick up
the paper that day and peruse Mr. Graham's little masterpiece. Lies
about her in a national publication don't exactly make her day so she
writes a retort to Ike's editor, correcting the 15 -- count 'em -- 15
factual errors he made. The editor (coincidentally his ex-wife) fires
him. His friend makes the down-on-his-luck Graham this offer: if he goes
to Maggie's hometown and Maggie, currently engaged for the fourth time,
runs from the altar again, he gets a cover story in GQ magazine.
Our merry journalist does go to Maggie's hometown and meets Maggie as
well some of the colorful characters in her life. There's Peggy,
Maggie's sympathetic, supportive friend (played by my favorite actress,
Joan Cusack); her stereotypically spunky grandmother, and of course her
husband-to-be Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni). Bob is a nice enough guy
but Ike can't help but wonder whether he is right for Maggie and more
importantly whether he himself has feelings for the legendary Runaway
Bride.
The romance that inevitably blooms between Maggie and Ike is, for once,
palpable and tangible. They fall in love like real people would. There
is no suddenness; the romance develops gradually and believably. We can
see not only that they have fallen for each other but also that they can
live together for many happy years.
Julia Roberts looks luminously young as Ms. Carpenter and her
performance works just as well as her makeup. She's spontaneous, funny
and human and so is her character. She pulls her role off with
impeccable precision, making us believe that Maggie is a complex adult
with real issues as opposed to an indecisive airhead who has ruined many
a life with her irresponsible choices. Richard Gere is a bit too
sarcastic and impersonal in the first 2/3 of The Runaway Bride but
finishes off strong to make his performance a success. And what can I
say about Joan Cusack? One of the best working actresses, she is in top
form: her performance is fine-tuned and hilarious even though her role
is underwritten.
The Runaway Bride likewise benefits from top-notch comic timing.
Director Gary Marshall gives his film an even, rhythmic pace and
disperses enough delightful gags to make the movie a good comedy in
addition to being an exceptional love story. Some of the jokes are
cliched, true, but even some of those are funny enough to work.
Like most romantic comedies, this one doesn't say anything exceptionally
daring or resonant, but that doesn't prevent it from being a terrific
movie. The Runaway Bride is a standout because the romance at its core
seems like a real one. In addition to laughing at what we see, we
believe it too. That has become so rare in modern movies that The
Runaway Bride should be cherished.

         "Runaway Bride" begins with a startling image, that of the
lovely Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) in her wedding gown and on
horseback, racing through the fields of rural Maryland to the tune of
U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For." Right away, we know
we've entered the realm of the screwball comedy where everyone is quirky
and everything is slightly askew. In some ways, "Bride" serves as a
mirror image of another one of Roberts' hits, "My Best Friend's
Wedding": In that film, her character was breaking up another person's
nuptuals, while in this one, Maggie successfully sabotages her own.
 It turns out the escape we're seeing marks the third time
Maggie has fled the altar at the last minute, a personality trait that
has made her a legend/laughingstock in her hometown and in her own home.
"You can't imagine how much cake we've gotten stuck with," complains
Maggie's grandmother. "It's a wonder I don't weigh 300 pounds."
 Maggie's habit of jilting fiances draws the attention of Ike
Graham (Richard Gere), a columnist for USA Today renowned for writing
what his detractors call "bitter diatribes about women." Without
bothering to verify rumors he's heard about her, Ike conjures up a
libelous attack on Maggie which ends up damaging his reputation instead
of hers. Fired for writing these lies, Ike decides to learn the truth
about Maggie, and "Bride" quickly becomes a sensational example of how
the chemistry between two stars can turn a modest script into great fun.
         When Gere and Roberts were first paired up nine years ago in
"Pretty Woman," the result delighted a whole lot of people, and "Bride"
proves lightning can strike twice. Watching them interact onscreen is
practically intoxicating, since, like all great movie couples, they
truly bring out the best in each other. Roberts' girl-next-door vibrance
humanizes the sometimes staunchy Gere; Gere's savoir faire seems to set
Roberts completely at ease.
 Though it takes a enormous leap of faith to get past "Bride"'s
set-up (and to ignore the question of how Maggie manages to continue
snagging beaus given her reputation), the results prove to be worth it.
The screenplay by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon manages to map out
an unconventional route to its destination, as well as working in a
valid message about how important it is to know yourself before you
decide to tie the knot. "Bride" also offers a hilarious performance by
Christopher Meloni as Maggie's sports-minded husband-to-perhaps-be and
charming parts for such proven comic talents as Joan Cusack, Laurie
Metcalf and Paul Dooley. The casting throughout the film is flawless.
 As Roberts' romances go, "Bride" is not as witty as "Notting
Hill," but it's warmer and more consistent. Nor does it pale next to
"Pretty Woman." The filmmakers were smart enough to realize everyone
would be making comparisons so Parriott and McGibbon have thrown in a
couple of smart nods to famous "Pretty" scenes and director Garry
Marshall continues the joke by recruiting "Pretty" veterans Hector
Elizondo and Larry Miller to fill key supporting roles.
 Of course, what ultimately matters here is whether or not the
sparks still fly between the leads. Consider this evidence: When Maggie
and Ike finally succumbed to each other, the preview audience responded
with an almost deafening chorus of screams, sighes and cheers. It was
the sound of 500 or so people simultaneously falling in love all over
again.

The Runaway Bride is one of those films that comes along that seems as if it
too very little thought to come up with; and probably did. But somehow you
still like the characters and the story itslef. Also you realize it's fault,
which come in abundance as well. Overall this is a split decision (positive or
negative review in general) and I am going to have to go towards a negative
response.
In this movie Miss Roberts plys a women who seemingly looks at marriage as a
contact sport. She leads those men up to the altar and then throws the final
punch and runs off (hence the title). Once the big-time journalist (for USA
Today) Ike Graham from the "big city" hears about this he writes a demeaning
article for which he is fired. In order to redeem himself and perhaps get his
job back he goes to the small hometown of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) and
promises to stay for her next wedding and write an article that is completely
truthful. Maybe he'll even clear her name.
In this film, the cast of one of the greatest romantic comedies of the nineties
(Pretty Women), comes back to a project that is also about love and how it
isn't always perfect unless you're perfect for one another. Only this time the
idea is not as fresh and interesting instead dull and easily predictable.
While the characters are easily relatable and we may laugh now and then at a
cute or funny joke thrown in, sometimes those laughs are what I like to refer
to as 'pity laughs'. Although I amhappy to say this film didn't call for all
that many of those.
I will be the first to admit that I am an advid Julia Roberts fan. I even liked
My Best Friends Wedding. And the question that is the most important to be
asked by critics for this film is whether or not, in our opinion, Richard Gere
and Roberts believably fell in love again in The Runaway Bride. Sadly, my reply
is no.
But I cannot hoinestly blame that on the actors, I must shift the blame over to
the writers. Who had a cute idea for this but did not get enough into the two
lead characters and their deep personalities. There were a few scenes when we
do get some information on this but not enough to convince me that these two
characters, both with seperate and different mind sets, were in love with one
another.
To wrap this up instead of rambling on, I just barely give a negative opinion
on this. Because while it is cute and a movie that is great for a young
couple... it leaves you wondering whether it could have been better. Whether it
could have been more than it was. The acting helped the film and some of the
clever punchlines along the way made for a clever experience. Because this
could go either way, see it for yourself.     C

A lot's been said about the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard 
Gere, the actors reunited a decade after their hit Pretty Woman.  Garry 
Marshall returns as their director in Runaway Bride, a story that entertains 
and charms but falls just this side of the status of major romantic comedy.
Yes, the chemistry's there, and Marshall seems to have romantic formulas 
down to a science.  From the credit-less opening to the set decoration, the 
film is slick and fairly fast-paced.  The piece is two hours long and it 
fills all of these minutes pleasantly enough.  I think what is missing, 
though, is enough character development, especially of Ike Graham, Gere's 
character;  we don't know him quite enough to care enough.
We know that Graham is an acerbic columnist for USA Today, based in 
Manhattan.  His specialty seems to be busting the chops of the opposite sex. 
  (A running gag involves Graham's being rapped by newspaper-swinging old 
women.)  When he fails to check the facts given him by one drunken source, 
Ike gets fired.  It's oddly convenient that his editor is his "ex," Ellie 
(Rita Wilson).  She's now married to one of Ike's best friends, Fisher 
(Hector Elizondo, a fixture in Marshall movies).  So the legendary Ike 
Graham is out of work, the paper printing a retraction that appears to 
please the victim of  Ike's column, one Maggie Carpenter (Roberts).
What's the conceit here?  It's the Runaway Bride angle, the fact that Maggie 
has strode down the aisle and then skedaddled three times, leaving three men 
witless and wife-less.  Because she's stuck it to him, Ike decides to shadow 
Maggie for another story, this time a piece for GQ, and he drives the 90 or 
so miles down the coast to Hale, Maryland, where Maggie runs the family 
hardware store.  Of course Ike's new take on the situation is that she will 
run again, and it just happens that Maggie is engaged to a fourth guy, an 
extremely decent mountain climber and high school football coach named Bob 
(Christopher Meloni).  Maggie is not pleased to see Ike's invasion of her 
domain, and she strikes first in a unique scene that shows us Ike with a 
multi-colored head.
What's funny here is how Ike insinuates himself into Maggie's life.  He 
seems to beat Maggie to every destination her life carries her:  when she 
arrives home, Ike is already there talking with her father and grandmother 
about her; when she drives to an ex-fiance's garage, Ike is sitting in an 
old Volkswagen 'Thing" atop the hydraulic lift, a picture of a topless 
Maggie in his hands.  When Maggie reverses the role and begins to appear 
inside Ike's quarters when he arrives home, the conflict and comedy 
increase.  The remainder of the plot follows Ike as he follows Maggie.  
After a time the two form a rather improbably friendship, Maggie offering to 
let Ike interview her for a rather large fee (which she plans to spend on an 
extravagant wedding dress).  All the time the chemistry between the two is 
reacting more intensely.  At a luau that friend Peggy Flemming (Joan Cusack) 
throws for Maggie, Ike even defends Maggie when her friends go too far with 
the runaway bride jokes.
The film does a nice job with all this rising action, Ike's hunt for clues 
with which to assassinate Maggie's character, and Maggie's counteractions, 
subtly assisted by her friends.  A bit of flatness hits once the climax is 
over, though; the predictable premise of all romantic comedies comes across 
as simply a way to end the film - although it never reaches a high level of 
satisfaction.
Maybe we need to know more about Ike Graham.  From the outset he has to 
wrestle with the stereotype of being a shallow misogynist, a man hated by 
half the human race.  We know he's divorced from Ellie the editor.  We 
discover he's an aspiring novelist, a vocation his mother wanted for him, 
and indeed this is made more plausible by the books on his shelf (including 
Melville), and the ones he reads as he and Maggie go through the mini-scenes 
that show they are falling in love (Yeats, Poe).  But we know very little 
else.  After he arrives in Hale Ike rarely even uses his mini-recorded, and 
we never see him actually scribbling or word-processing anything resembling 
a piece for GQ, a publication never mentioned after Fisher brings it up.  
This doesn't surprise, as other subplots are not completed either, including 
one in which Walter, Maggie's father (Paul Dooley), is an alcoholic whose 
behavior only Maggie rather mildly objects to.
More characterization would let us like Ike more, even though Richard Gere 
does nice work handling his character.  Most of the focus is placed on 
Maggie - if Henry James were a screenwriter in the late twentieth-century, 
he would occupy himself with writing such character studies.  Maggie's 
psychology is filled in rather interestingly.  One part of her is compliant, 
Zelig-like, in that she likes her eggs cooked the very same way as the man 
she is currently engaged to  marry.  Another part is egotistical, 
attention-seeking.  But after all, she is independent and competent, her job 
as hardware expert taking her into the obscure realm of antique fixtures and 
restoration.  She even designs lamps fabricated from a funky selection of 
electrical components.  Roberts handles Maggie with comfort: she's much more 
mature than her character in Pretty Woman - though still not secure.  
Roberts is a good sport, too: at one point she grabs those lips of hers and 
imitates a duck-billed platypus!
As Peggy Flemming ("not the skater"), Joan Cusack is her normal excellent 
self.  She's a veteran, and one hopes that her future roles get more screen 
time.  Cusack has a manner both sincere and comical, and she has some 
delightful interaction with Roberts that suggest their characters go back to 
girlhood.
Maggie's hometown of Hale, Maryland plays a supporting role here too.  The 
screenwriters, Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, often compare it to 
Mayberry, and this portrayal largely succeeds.  The result is a place gently 
satirized by Ike as he whistles the theme song to the 'The Andy Griffith 
Show" as he jogs beside Maggie riding her old-fashioned bike.  It's also a 
place that looks absolutely charming on screen, streets cozily arranged, 
storefronts invitingly shot.  A place, in short, that exists in our 
collective memory, mythic and non-existent.  A familiar and down-home burg 
120 miles south-southwest of Manhattan.  You can hear Garry Marshall with 
his New York accent saying, "OK, everything nice!  Roll it!"  Actually, the 
contrast between Hale's sleepy streets and the Big Apple locales functions 
nicely.
Though it will not be included in the canon of major American romantic 
comedies, Runaway Bride is entertaining fare.  We saw the film in its second 
week of release, and it is better than the buzz said it would be.  The PG 
rating is very pleasing, too - we brought along our daughter without any 
problem of pre-screening.

Runaway Bride has the same characters, lead cast, director, and genre as 
the 1990 hit, Pretty Woman. Yet it simply isn't as good as its 
antecedent, because the plot can only work one time before becoming over 
used, or perhaps because the R rated sexual humor from Runaway Bride's 
nine year predecessor is largely absent this time in favor of a family 
friendly PG rating.
Julia Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter, a woman who has three times used 
her walk down the aisle as a warm up to the sprint that soon followed as 
she escaped the wedding vows. A very flirtatious and beautiful woman, 
she seems to have no qualms about going from man to man. Her father even 
quips "She may not be the longest running joke in town, but she sure is 
the fastest." Roberts' portrayal of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman was very 
similar if not identical.
In Pretty Woman, Vivian began to reform when a very conservative man, 
Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) entered her life. Nearly a decade later, 
Gere does it again when he enters Maggie's life as a New York City 
newspaper reporter, Ike Graham. Continuing with the long list of 
similarities, Runaway Bride includes a scene where Gere has to negotiate 
to buy Roberts' time and attention, and another where he takes her dress 
shopping- perhaps the two most memorable and acclaim scenes from Pretty 
Woman.      
Runaway Bride is a visually astounding film. The panoply of scenery is 
never better highlighted than the opening sequence where images of a 
horse trotting through a field in the marvelous country side are quickly 
cut to images of New York City. The many scenes out of city are 
beautifully framed with lovely background and pastel colors. The city 
scenes are more edgy and harsh visually, providing a nice juxtaposition 
of the opposite lifestyles that collide.
The only sexual jokes you'll find in Runaway Bride come from Maggie's 
grandmother, and are watered down references to "the one eyed monster" 
and its duties on the wedding night. The biggest laughs come from hair 
dye and a cheesy FedEx joke about on-time delivery. You can't help but 
miss the numerous references to condoms, drugs, and prostitution that 
the jokes in Pretty Woman provided, creating far bigger laughs than 
anything you'll find here.  
Runaway Bride holds itself to a higher standard by choosing to display 
numerous similarities to Pretty Woman, and never being the slightest bit 
shy about it. Because of that, it ends up committing a suicide of sorts; 
having attempted to shoot for the stars and not being willing to settle 
for the sky instead. At one point in the film, Ike explains his 
profession by saying "We push, we stretch, we go out on a limb." Runaway 
Bride does just that, it pushes, it stretches, and it goes out on a 
limb. But I think the limb just snapped.

Runaway Bride is a Pretty Woman reunion that feels more light and fluffy
than it's predecessor. But, despite it's obvious tone and rather
formulaic script, it still manages to be a crowd-pleaser.
The stars do a great deal to enliven what is actually a sub-par romance.
Richard Gere plays Ike Graham, a USA Today columnist who is desperate
for a story idea. Through an acquaintance in a bar, he discovers
information that could make for interesting reading: a small-town girl
named Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts), dubbed as the `runaway bride',
has become notorious for leaving her groom at the alter for a series of
up to 7 or 8 incidents. Graham, rushing to meet the deadline, types up
the column to have it published in the paper the following day.
But the real Maggie Carpenter spots the headline, and does not
appreciate the gross exaggerations that Graham uses in his writing style
(she insists it was only three times that she high-tailed it out of a
wedding). His editor (and ex-wife, played by Rita Wilson) ends up firing
Ike, but a friend (played by Hector Elizondo) offers him another chance
to get his facts straight. And so the big city boy goes off to Hale,
Maryland to investigate the real truth and attempt to express his
apologies to Maggie. Who knows, the two might even fall for each other
in the end......
It was a wise move for director Gary Marshall to return to his romance
roots and try to re-invent his biggest hit. Lately, Marshall has been
lagging seriously behind (I'm pretty sure Exit to Eden didn't make any
Ten Best lists). This reunion with Roberts and Gere should be a
sure-fire hit, and even if the material is recycled scrap, the
presentation is modestly charming and always watchable. Both stars look
pretty enough to single-handedly save any film, no matter how terribly
the script may be constructed.
Runaway Bride is predictable, to say the least, but it has a certain
charm. The supporting cast is made up of largely familiar faces,
including another Pretty Woman vet: Hector Elizondo. Elizondo stole many
scenes in the 1990 film as a courteous hotel owner, and his performance
here is again impressive. Joan Cusack, as Maggie's quirky best friend,
is basically typecast once again and injects a lot of natural humor into
the proceedings. The two lead characters hate each other so much it
seems impossible that they'll end up together. Minimal sparks fly
between Roberts and Gere, but they both turn in believable performances,
even as they are being pushed toward a highly improbable happy ending.
Star power is the glue that holds this film together. The script has all
the regular clichés associated with this kind of film, and reliance on
the lead performances is huge. The set-up has some obvious problems, but
once Runaway Bride gets into a natural flow, it's easy to enjoy. But
please, next time spare us some of the humor associated with Maggie's
perverted grandmother, who explains in detail her disastrous honeymoon
night. This is a light romantic comedy, and a character like hers seems
somewhat out of place.
This is Julia Roberts' second summer romance (the first was Notting
Hill), and she has submitted another charming performance. Still, this
remains Pretty Woman-lite. The PG rating ensures the film is suitable
for family viewing, but it also adds some restrictions. Someone
searching for a sweet escape to the theater could do far worse than
Runaway Bride, if they are in the mood for something fitfully
entertaining but not terribly original. This has been done a dozen times
before, but never with this kind of star charisma.

As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)
 The saying "they don't make them like they used to" should be revised for
movies.  In movies, they make them exactly like they used to.  Thinking back
on the romantic comedies I have seen, all of them have the same basic
formula.  Their characters are pulled out of some antiquated storeroom
reserved for the genre, and then put to use in a simplistic script.  The
lines change.  The specifics of the plot change.  Everything else remains
the same.
 I am not going to say that Runaway Bride is a complete rip of Pretty Woman.
I am not saying that the reunion is a remake in disguise.  What I will say
is that Runaway Bride is exactly what you should expect from a romantic
comedy in the summer: a simple plot, a simple script, and two big names to
guarantee box office revenues.
 Runaway Bride is not as terribly cliché as The Wedding Singer, which had no
originality whatsoever, but it is cliché to the point that the originality
only comes in a few good jokes littered here and there and some nice lines.
The plot is simple: unhappy single columnist for USA TODAY Ike Graham (Gere)
hears about a woman that likes to leave her grooms on the alter named Maggie
Carpenter (Julia Roberts).  He writes a highly antagonistic column about her
and then is fired when an angry letter to the editor contains a list of
inaccuracies that the column contained.  Not to be completely deterred,
Fisher, a freelance photographer doing work for GQ, puts out the offer that
if he gets an accurate scoop on Maggie, then GQ will take the article.
 So, driving a car that no journalist could afford, he heads off to Hale, a
town so stereotypically small town that it would urge bile from most New
Yorkers.  It has a barbershop quartet, a Main street, an Elm street, etc.
Of course, as he gets to know the real Maggie, Ike begins falling in love
with her.
 There are the standard hurdles in the on screen relationship: the initial
hatred of the man, the close-call to breakup caused by the woman at the end,
and the fact that the woman is already in a relationship with someone who is
obviously a jerk.  All of these hurdles are jumped over with Olympic class
skill by veterans of movie relationships (and mutual victims of real life
divorce) Richard Gere and Julia Roberts both adept competitors at the
romantic comedy 50 yard dash.
 At the end, everything turns out fine and dandy.  We are even forced to sit
through credits showing a series of happy couples (including the former
boyfriend of Maggie, who has found true love in a New York tomboy).
 As bitter a diatribe as I myself could go on about how the movies are
always this way, Runaway Bride manages to pull off the same old con that we
have seen a million times before with enough panache that we don't mind
being deprived of our money.  In fact, as with most horribly cliché movies
(see Deep Blue Sea), we will willingly part ways with our money and come out
of the theatre smiling.
 Seeing as this is a reunion of the bunch that gave us Pretty Woman hundreds
of trite romantic comedies ago, we might as well respect the sanctity of
older people who can still cut it (even if they barely scrape by) and submit
to seeing this film.  Enjoy.

_Runaway_Bride_ (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Ever since _Pretty_Woman_ came out of nowhere to become a box office
sensation in 1990--and propelling Julia Roberts's star and salary into
the stratosphere--there has been ongoing rumblings about a possible
sequel.  Thankfully, no such unnecessary revisit with millionaire Edward
Lewis and prostitute Vivian Ward has ever made it to the big screen, but
some nine years after the release of that much-loved romantic comedy
comes something quite close to a sequel: a reunion of stars Roberts and
Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall.  And while _Runaway_Bride_
isn't quite at the magical level of _Pretty_Woman_ (then again, what
is?), this satisfying charmer has all the makings of (pardon the bad pun)
another runaway hit.
Aside from _Pretty_Woman_, _Runaway_Bride_ must also face comparison
with Roberts's early-summer romantic comedy hit, _Notting_Hill_, and
again the newer film falls short; it lacks the running satire of
Tinseltown celebrity that gave that fluffy film an unexpected edge. 
_Runaway_Bride_ is simply just fluff, with a typically preposterous
set-up to match: New York-based _USA Today_ columnist Ike Graham (Gere)
hears about Hale, Maryland resident Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) penchant
for abandoning bridegrooms at the altar--3 and counting--from a stranger
at a bar and then proceeds to write an unflattering piece on her.  His
inaccuracy-filled article prompts a complaint letter from Maggie, costing
Ike his job.  Seeing a "corrected" piece on Maggie as a way to jumpstart
a freelance career--and anxious to see her dump Groom Number 4, whom she
is set to wed in a week's time--Ike goes down to Hale to investigate.
Once the knotty exposition is out of the way, it is Marshall and
scripters Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott's job to step back and let
the Roberts-Gere sparks take over, and the well-matched stars pick up
where they left off on that Hollywood fire escape nine years ago; they
sizzle together, and it is impossible not to have a rooting interest in
their characters' eventual coupledom.  Equally as well-matched are each
star and their respective role.  Maggie is a flighty kook not unlike
_Pretty_Woman_''s Vivian, except (to crib a line from _She's_All_That_)
"for the whole hooker thing," and accordingly, Roberts is very convincing
in Maggie's skin.  On the other hand, Ike is a polar opposite to
_Pretty_Woman_'s uptight Edward, but Gere obviously has fun--and _is_
quite fun--as a charming, if troublemaking, scamp.
Of course, Marshall and the writers cannot completely disappear, and
they bring a number of entertaining comic situations--including a couple
of blatant, but not distracting, mirror scenes to _Pretty_Woman_--and
witty dialogue to the affair.  They also surround Roberts and Gere with a
colorful supporting cast; the standouts are the always-effective Joan
Cusack as Maggie's best friend and Christopher Meloni, a hoot as Maggie's
athletic-minded fiancé.  In addition to Roberts, Gere, and Marshall,
Hector Elizondo is also on hand for the reunion, but his involvement in
the story is limited at best as Ike's photographer friend.  Especially
disappointing is Elizondo's lack of onscreen interaction with Roberts,
with whom he worked so memorably in the last collaboration.
_Runaway_Bride_ is sure to be knocked as ridiculous hokum, which, much
like _Pretty_Woman_, it certainly is.  And like that previous film, it
gives the audience what it wants to see: an irresistible confection that
serves up the laughs and a sweet, involving romance, with the proven
Roberts-Gere electricity as the not-so-secret ingredient that gives the
film its special kick.

Starring: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere
Synopsis: 
Small town bride Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) has been nicknamed the
runaway bride for leaving various men stranded at the altar. On three
different occasions Maggie has gotten cold feet and dumped the groom by
running away in the middle of the wedding ceremony. Because she's too used
to playing along rather than asserting what she really wants Maggie just
can't make the big commitment.
When cynical USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Richard Gere) blows into town
to cover Maggie's fourth wedding attempt and write a nasty article, he ends
up falling in love with Maggie. 
Opinion: 
After nine years PRETTY WOMAN director Garry Marshall and stars Roberts and
Gere are reunited for another romance, apparently in the hopes they'll cash
in on the PRETTY WOMAN nostalgia crowd. While RUNAWAY BRIDE does provide
the nostalgia of seeing Roberts and Gere reunited in romance, it lacks two
key ingredients: warmth and conviction.
As city slicker Ike Graham, Gere is condescending to the rural folk,
treating all townspeople like idiots to be easily swindled and charmed. The
townspeople actually vindicate this view by acting like rubes, dolts and
alcoholics, especially during the pre-wedding dinner. RUNAWAY BRIDE's
portrayal of rural people as self-absorbed, unintelligent, or drunk never
wavers, and this is how the film loses charm.
The token characters that Roberts and Gere play aren't written with
conviction. Maggie says her basic problem is that she is unable to assert
her individualism. But how come in her spare time she kickboxes and creates
unique art? Similarly, Ike Graham is supposed to be from New York, but his
New York accent occasionally vanishes.
RUNAWAY BRIDE is an okay movie for taking the wife or girlfriend because it
is a paint-by-numbers romance, because crowd favorites Roberts and Gere are
easy protagonists to cheer for, and because the movie contains at least one
great commercial for Federal Express. But if you hate predictable movies
you'd better buy yourself a big cup of coffee.

Romantic comedy is largely about oppositions, and the eventual collapse of
those oppositions into a happy ending. Which suggests that those oppositions
weren't oppositions after all. In Gary Marhsall's Runaway Bride, Maggie
(Julia Roberts) and Ike (Richard Gere), are earmarked early on for such a
happy ending by how opposite they seem to be: city boy and country girl;
misogynist and man-eater; harried freelance journalist and sedentary 9-5
hardware store manager; etc. This is all established in about four minutes.
Underneath those tags, however, are two people who are both defined by their
manner when the clock's ticking down: Maggie walking down the aisle and Ike
with 15 minutes left to write a story.
Which is how Runaway Bride opens, with Maggie running and Ike getting a
second-hand version of her running and then writing it into his column.
Which is the initial complication that draws them together: Maggie disagrees
with Ike's write-up of her vehemently enough that he's 'assigned' to cover
her pending wedding. If she runs, he's vindicated; if she doesn't, he loses
this country girl he's falling for. It all gets a little complicated, which
is nice. What isn't so nice is that Ike's assignment feels a little
contrived, a little too functional. This is a direct result of there being
no sharp turning point into the country for him, but more of a gradual and
inevitable curve, shaped not by dramatic events but by the necessity of
reuniting Gere and Roberts on-screen for another Pretty Woman, a pressure
Pretty Woman alumn Gary Marshall must have been acutely aware of. It shows.
Since then and now though things have changed a bit, however. Most recently,
there's been My Best Friend's Wedding and Forces of Nature, both offering
non-traditional 'comedic' endings which skew our expectations a bit as
concerns wedding-movies, both of them suggesting that the happiest ending
isn't always the one we want to be the happy ending. Runaway Bride could
have used this to its advantage, but it chooses not to. Instead it relies a
bit desperately on Gere and Roberts to turn mediocre writing into magic.
Granted, Joan Cusack is wonderful in her habitual sidekick role, adding
humor and a little tenderness to the proceedings, but in the final analysis
it's Gere and Roberts. There's simply no room for anyone else, not even
Maggie's current betrothed, Coach Bob.
And Coach Bob even seems aware of this in his military-athletic way, bowing
gracefully out for Ike. And again, it's a little bit of a set-up, but at
least this time it's supported by convention, by the need for comedic
reversal: Maggie, habitually running away from men she's attracted to, will
instinctively cling to the one she's repulsed by. She has to. The genre
demands it. Similarly, Ike has to be the groom that no other groom was for
Maggie, do what none of the others did: chase her, literally or
figuratively. Like the boy who brought the king water in Fisher King. In
Runaway Bride's favor, however, there is at least the suggestion of a larger
narrative functioning, a little tension over whether Maggie will become part
of Ike's story (another sacrifice to the dailies) or whether he'll become
part of hers (another groom left with a lot of cake left to eat alone),
which, in a Gere/Roberts movie not predicated on a Roy Orbison ditty, is
finally all we have to cling to.

Maybe I'm just a bigger fan of the original films that spawned the latest
batch of romantic comedies, YOU'VE GOT MAIL (5.5/10)-see SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE, NOTTING HILL (5.5/10)-see FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, and RUNAWAY
BRIDE (5.5/10)-see PRETTY WOMAN, but ultimately, I just found the most
recent crop of big-name star flicks to be too predictable and generally
uninteresting.
PLOT:
A cynical big city reporter finds a good story in a small town girl's
penchant for dropping her soon-to-be hubbies at the altar.
CRITIQUE:
This film never bored me, but never really entertained me either. It was
just there. I can't truly recommend it because despite some good
performances from Julia Roberts and Joan Cusack, the overall comedy in the
film was lacking and the romance didn't truly ignite until the film's final
fifteen minutes. Richard Gere also seemed bored to be there, and essentially
walked through his role and directly to the bank to cash in his big-ass
paycheck for this redundant part. Others seemed exaggerated and unbelievably
ignorant to believe (Why on earth was husband #4 so chummy with the
conniving reporter who was in town solely to disprove their real love for
one another?).
The general lack of suspense or believability of this film also left me
ho-humming past its overstated soundtrack, which featured easy-to-follow
words associated to the specific scenes, and the overdone montage sequences
which are generally used to pump up a weak script. I did enjoy Joan Cusack
as the quirky friend and some of the lessons learned, but overall this film
lacked the much needed charisma and chemistry that made PRETTY WOMAN what it
was. This film is a much better choice as video fodder on a lazy summer
afternoon, and might be enjoyed by most Gere and Roberts fans, but the rest
of us movie-going folk who like to see movies with plenty of romance, comedy
and charm, should certify this film as bride's maid, and check out the
ultimate bride, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10/10).
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Rumor has it that Julia Roberts was once a "runaway bride" of her own. Actor
Kiefer Sutherland and her were engaged to be married back in the day, when
she suddenly bolted on him, and left him for fellow actor and friend, Jason
Patric.
Richard Gere has been a Buddhist for over a decade, and was banned from the
Oscars once after making anti-China comments on the air at the 1993
ceremony. He is also an accomplished pianist and music writer. He hails from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Alumni from PRETTY WOMAN include director Garry Marshall, actors Julia
Roberts, Richard Gere, Hector Elizondo and Larry Miller. Elizondo is
considered by director/producer Garry Marshall to be his "good luck charm",
and as such is offered a role in each of his movies.
Director Marshall also makes a cameo in this film as the first baseman
during the baseball game sequence. He would be the one catching the ball
that is tossed over to first base.
Actress Rita Wilson is married to super-star movie actor Tom Hanks.
This film was originally titled PRETTY BRIDE.
