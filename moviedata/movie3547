"The Circus" is a silent film that was produced, directed,
and written by Charlie Chaplin.  He again is playing
the familiar tramp character, who in his struggle to get
along in the world keeps getting in and out of trouble.
The tramp gets mixed up with a pickpocket.  He is chased by
a policeman into a circus, and his attempts to avoid arrest
delight the audience, who take him for a clown.  Soon, the
tramp is a featured attraction.  Chaplin falls for the
young daughter of the abusive circus manager, but she only 
sees him as a friend.
"The Circus" may be the most Keaton-esque of Chaplin's
features.  The plot is simple, and serves mostly as a
background for lots and lots of slapstick gags.  The miracle
is that all of the gags work and are funny.  What is missing
from this film, and is usually present in Chaplin films,
is social commentary.  This time around, Chaplin is only 
trying to make us laugh, and he certainly succeeds.
What is the funniest scene in "The Circus"?  My favorite
has Chaplin walking a tightrope, with monkeys crawling over
his face in body, biting his nose and pulling his pants down.
It's a screech!  Honorable mention goes to a scene where
the jealous tramp fantasizes about giving the rival for 
his love interest a kick in the rear.
