No movie critic (except those that grew up watching Masters of the
Universe) worth his salt would give this "action-thriller" by Russell
Mulcahy a three star rating. In a year filled with scores of
action-thrillers that reads like: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, BROKEN ARROW,
CABLE GUY, ..... SILENT TRIGGER can at best claim to be
not-so-action-oriented action-thriller.
Starring M.I.T's Fulbright scholar cum muscleman Dolph Lundgren
(MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE) and England based actress Gina Bellman (LEON
THE PIG FARMER), Silent Trigger revolves around a pair of hired
killers (Lundgren & Gina) staking out in a deserted skyscaper waiting
for their kill target. Receiving instructions from a mysterious figure
known only as the "Supervisor", they have to overcome a series of
stumbling blocks including two security agents who are intent on
keeping the premises safe. (Well, actually one was more intent on
getting into Bellman's pants).
The film centers on Lundgren having serious reservations about the
morality of his profession with flashbacks of a past failed
assasination attempt with Bellman haunting him. Although the
flashbacks provided much details on their past, it offered little
about what the whole movie was about. The audience spent most of their
time wondering about who these hired killers were, what organisation
they were from, and who were their targets.
As far as "action" is concerned, expect a fair amount of the usual gun
fights; blazing machine guns and the likes. My advice is, save your $7
for high tea unless you are a member of
Gina-Bellman-Admirers-Anonymous.
