A visually playful version of Marcel Proust's epic "Remembrance Of
Things Past," which only covers the last volume of a lengthy
multi-volume book; but, continually makes references to other parts of
the book not covered in the film. The film is almost incomprehensible
without reading the book, as there's no time to introduce all of the
story line and characters (though an attempt was made to introduce the
main characters, as the dying Proust puts a magnifying glass to the
photos in his collection that bring back his memories); for those who
are not readers of the book this is not a substitute for the book, but a
work that, nevertheless, lives on its own merits. To expect anything to
be less than opaque from an undertaking of such a difficult work to
adapt to the screen is, perhaps, asking too much of anyone. To ask it of
Raul Ruiz, the stylish, surrealist Chilean exiled director, now a
citizen of France, is asking him to do what has never done before. In a
Ruiz film one must expect a work that is obscure and mysterious. That
this combination avant garde art film and literary period drama is
successful in its bold attempt to go where most other filmmakers fear to
go, into the labyrinthian world of Proust's dying era during the early
part of the 20th century and to come away with a work of such dreamlike
beauty, is simply an amazing feat. It's a film that doesn't necessarily
tell a story, but brings you instead to the conclusion of "Remembrance
Of Things Past" in an unforgettably eccentric way.
Proust's work is about the eternal nature of memory, as the opening
scene takes you into his cork-lined bedroom, where he is ill in bed
feverishly writing or dictating to the maid Celeste who is caring for
him; he is in rush to complete his writings, as he expects to die soon.
Proust will be played by all the following: with Marcello Mazzarella
(the Italian actor is a dead-ringer for Proust) as `Marcel' in the main
role, Andre Engel as `old Marcel,' Jean Leger as the actor who dubs
Engel, Georges du Fresne as `Marcel as a child,' Pierre Mignard as
`Marcel as an adolescent,' and director and actor Patrice Chereau as
`the voice of Marcel Proust.'
In this dying atmosphere Marcel will revisit his past, as the film is
not linear so we will see him as he was throughout his life -- from a
youngster to middle-aged to his present condition -- at any time during
the film. His memories are awakened by any memento in his bedchamber;
such things, as even the taste of a madeleine, a sweet pastry he loved
as a child, will bring back a memory of an earlier event. In these
memories he will reminds us, that to remember the past is to experience
its loss; the writer will act as our guide into his fictional and real
world: telling about such things as: his yearnings, his fears, his
feelings on death and love, the behavior of high class society, and
about the gossip and betrayals among his friends.
The film is made up of a succession of formal social gatherings in
palatial homes through which finely dressed women gossip wearing either
brocades or fashionable feathers sticking out of their hair; while the
formally dressed men parade around in the ballroom with the look of
contented bulls; the film's most artistic image is of the men's upturned
top hats covering the floor of an ornate waiting room. The time period
for most of the action is during WW1 (1914-18).
Marcel remembers Paris as a time of suffering from asthma, where he
wanders the deserted night streets because of the curfew. In one of the
decadent scenes he comes out of the night to rest and chooses to stay at
a male bordello, Palais des Felicites, where he spies the perverse Baron
Charlus (Malkovich) seducing young men to whip him. He chats with the
attractive Gilberte (Béart) when she returns alone to Tansonville to
check out her chateau after the death of her bi-sexual husband
Saint-Loup (Greggory) at the front. Marcel has always loved her because
she made him believe he was capable of loving others, something he
wasn't sure he was capable of doing. She's the daughter of his old
friend Odette (Deneuve), someone he has a special fondness for. He meets
the flirtatious violinist Morel (Perez), who is an army deserter, when
he's hiding in a dinghy hotel. Marcel talks with him about his strained
love relationship with the Baron, where now Morel despises him. And
through his conversations with the ghosts he conjures up on his
deathbed, he relates how hard the war was on all those he knew. We are
treated to funerals as spectacles that look oddly enough like convivial
affairs. Marcel finds refuge in his childhood memories to escape the
horror stories around him. Madame Verdurin (Pisier) appears giddy and
controlling at her parties, the ones Marcel seems to recall best. In one
party scene Madame Verdurin notices that Odette appears and Verdurin
objects to a lady friend: "What's she doing here? How does the
repeatedly married Odette dare to show her face in this reception,
especially now that her looks are gone?" Madame Verdurin's companion
replies: "But you're wrong, Odette looks ravashing."
The film is loaded with surprises, as Ruiz uses Proust in the film to
meditate on how he would have used the film if he were to film his epic
instead of write it. There are all sorts of camera tricks used: shots
frozen in time, imitations of how the filmmakers of that time period
shot their films, and the past and present fuse sometimes together in a
surrealistic way. In Proustian logic, one can be old and young at the
same time.
It's an ambitious project, enhanced by its starry cast, filled with
splendid visuals and tidbits from conversations that don't linger long,
as the film moves intractably into the poetical. It's Proust you're
getting, but from a daring perspective. This is not a film to see only
once. It is also a rare film, that shouldn't be missed, even if it's
messy and one is apt to get lost in its decadent mood swings and
enthralling aristocratic atmosphere. The film just feels right for
either the reader of the novel as I was some 30 years ago who was trying
to recall what I could from the book as I watched, or the novice to
Proust who might just be entertained by what he or she sees on the
screen. There are some who claim that this is the best written novel of
the 20th century, and it very well might be! This film works, despite
being able to only capture the book in spirit but not in its whole. But
there is no doubt about one thing, this is what good filmmaking is
about!

 A literal adaptation of the final book of Marcel Proust's Remembrances
of Things Past would be inconceivable and boring, since the tastes and
smells which reveal layers of memory cannot be captured onscreen. Raoul
Ruiz's Time Regained does the next best thing. Ruiz weaves a fragmented,
experimental narrative in the form of a tapestry. There's an uncanny
beauty achieved by telling his story in this manner, which reveals
thoughts and inactions by using the very limitations of the film medium.
He presents us with a series of photographs, or images shot into mirrors
or through doorways which open up to the past and present (and cross-cut
between the two with relative ease.)
 Taking place within the huge estates and manor houses of the cultural
elite, with string quartets playing in their studies and tiny cakes
neatly arranged on trays in their kitchens, our main character, Marcel
(Marcelo Mazzarello) wanders through this world drinking it in. The plot
is inconsequential, it is more about observing the crowded rooms and
bitten back emotions, the sips of wine and soft handshakes. Every now
and then, Marcel is forced to confront his decadent relatives
(sneeringly funny John Malkovich and sour Pascal Greggory.)
 Ruiz cleverly stages a prologue with the elder Proust (Andre Engel,
voiced by filmmaker Patrice Chereau) wasting away in his bedroom, the
best years of his life behind him, reciting passages from his book to
his servant girl and allowing the objects in the room to trigger
thoughts about his family, his would-be lovers (particularly Odette, the
woman who haunts him his entire life, played by the elegant Catherine
Deneuve) and loved ones, his enemies and his false friends.
 Ruiz is a master at keeping his themes and meaning palatable and
comprehensible even when shifting from the main character's childhood to
middle age, or having the child and adult version of the protagonist
onscreen at the same time. It doesn't feel pretentious, since Ruiz
clearly has a sincere fondness for this main character. The stand-in for
Marcel Proust, Mazzarello, doesn't emote very much as he wanders
aimlessly through the elegant locations, but he has deep and friendly
eyes and a sad smile half hidden under his moustache.
 Marcel finds himself jumping back and forth in these memories, and one
starts to wonder how much he has romanticized that past? He may be
remarkably similar to the stuffed shirts who surround him, sitting in
their circles, smoking cigars and wondering who's who in terms of
reputation and their place in the ladder of class structure. Ultimately,
those things don't matter, and fade away. In the film's best scene, we
see his half mad colleague and former nemesis, Charlus (Malkovich) lead
him through the park as they discuss their old friends. `How is this
one? Mort. How is that one? Mort.' In the dialogue within this
exchange,. Proust's philosophy is revealed. Things fade away, and all we
have is this small, precious present moment in time  everything else
passes into dust.
 It's a difficult film to catch hold of, and demands enormous patience
and a willingness to allow yourself the ability to drink in this film,
as though it were some very rich cake to be savored. It demands to be
eaten slowly, and to slowly fill you up. It's not for every occasion,
though, or for every audience. Those unwilling to submit to a slow
paced, metaphysical project may quickly grow frustrated with this item,
but if you allow it to be an interactive experience, you may well
consider memories of your own through the process of watching  and
that's worth more than any film could offer.

And the corollary to this rule, in the case of TIME REGAINED (LE TEMPS 
RETROUVÉ), is that if you haven't read the seven volume set of novels 
called "Remembrance of Things Past" by Marcel Proust, the movie will 
probably be completely impenetrable.  
(Actually, I'm not so sure that those who have read the full set will be 
able to follow TIME REGAINED, written and directed by Raúl Ruiz, but I'm 
willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that anyone 
who has invested the time to read the entire seven volume set will love 
the film.  Maybe this explains why well-respected critics have differed 
so widely on their evaluation of the film, with some giving it their 
absolute best rating and others their absolute worst.  At any rate, this 
review will apply only to those who haven't read the books.) 
As the story opens, the dying Proust is lying on his bed, barely able to 
breathe, and is dictating his memoirs to his assistant.  Looking through 
a large magnifying glass, he views photographs of his old friends.  The 
rest of the movie consists of random vignettes from his life.  Watching 
these snippets feels like one is seeing a twenty-plus episode soap opera 
which some maniacal editor has hacked up and reassembled into something 
one tenth of the original size.  The result is a confusing and obtuse 
mess.
The collage of clips leaves us with many questions, chief among them: 
Who are all of these characters?  What relationship do they have with 
each other?  How does this scene fit in with any of the other scenes?  
And why should we care?
The more time and energy we devote to the story, the less we care.  Only 
the production has much to offer.  Some scenes are like beautifully 
faded picture postcards from a bygone era.  As the music comes up, 
others appear to be the introduction to grand opera, except that the 
diva never quite breaks into her aria.  Finally, many scenes appear to 
be something out of a Peter Sellers comedy in which all of the funny 
lines have been removed.
The movie has a strong cast, including Catherine Deneuve and Emmanuelle 
Béart. The less said, however, about John Malkovich's performance as a 
sadomasochistic baron, the better.
The movie is not without its treats.  We learn that, in pre-World War I 
France, strawberries dipped in ether was a delicacy and adultery was 
punished by a 100-Franc fine and a few days in jail.
TIME REGAINED runs an extremely long 2:35.  The film is in French with 
English subtitles.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for adult themes and
would be acceptable for teenagers.
