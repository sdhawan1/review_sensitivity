Tyne Daly, Colm Meaney
Directed by: Graham Theakston
Running Time: 96 minutes
A depressing and all too familiar tale of gamblers and other assorted
low lifes.  One of Boston's head mobsters decides one day to "trim the
fat" from the organization.  As a result, an aging bookie (Peter Falk)
is slowly forced out of the business by a young punk in the
organization (Freddie Prinze, Jr.).  Meanwhile, there's a running
subplot about a drunken loser (Timothy Hutton) who refuses to work to
support his wife (Lauren Holly) and their children.  Predictably, he
ends up placing a huge bet and losing, further destroying his family.
Money Kings seems like it would be fairly entertaining, but the
situations just keep getting more and more depressing, leading to an
obvious conclusion that really won't affect you one way or another.
The performances are decent (although Prinze is badly miscast), and
there's a fairly good Irish-type score.
Money Kings is available on DVD from Sterling Home Entertainment.  It
contains the film in it's standard format, and includes the usual cast
and crew bios, production notes, and the film's original trailer.  [R]
