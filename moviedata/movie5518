Plot: Not long after the death of his two children, Christy Nielsen is 
killed by a colliding car while going to aid a car crash victim. He 
finds himself in the afterlife which is not any traditional Heaven or 
Hell but a landscape of one's own imagination - he having composed his 
out of the classical artworks his wife Annie restored - and where one 
can inhabit whatever body they choose. But then comes the news that 
Annie, unable to handle the loss, has committed suicide. Here suicides 
are not condemned of Hell but a world wrapped in their own 
self-absorption. Christy ignores all warnings that he will be dragged 
down into her  closed-off world to venture in and save her.
New Zealander Vincent Ward is one of the most fascinating directors at 
work anywhere in the world at the moment. Ward trained as an artist at 
Canterbury University (only a few departments away from me) before 
turning to film- making. As a director he has an artist's fascination 
with the visual image - one cannot think of any other director in the 
world who would model the entire look of a film on the work of classical 
artists. His first feature film Vigil' (1985) is an extraordinarily 
composed poem written in landscape and light which almost entirely 
circumvents narrative to work on a level of pure imagery alone. The 
Cannes-acclaimed The Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey' (1988) was a time 
travel fantasy that Ward painted in the imagery of artists like Bruegel 
and Bosch that offered a haunting outsider's look in on the alienness of 
the 20th Century.
Ward lost the plot somewhat with 1992's Map of the Human Heart', an 
Innuit romance where his fascination with imagery neglected the film's 
crucial emotional core. And since Map' Ward's output has been erratic - 
he caught among the revolving door of directors attached to Alien3' and 
only ending up with story credit and then being forced to direct 
commercials and take bit parts in films like `Leaving Las Vegas' (1995) 
and One Night Stand' (1997) in order to stay off the unemployment line.
But What Dreams' is Ward's return to form and his most mainstream 
release yet. It is an adaption of the 1984 novel by acclaimed genre 
novelist/screenwriter Richard Matheson, author of the likes of The 
Incredible Shrinking Man', Duel', most of Roger Corman's Poe films in 
the 1960s, and numerous Twilight Zone' and Star Trek' episodes, among 
others. Ward's work on the film is quite extraordinary. He lights the 
screen up with impossible vistas of the imagination - a vast library 
where gondoliers drift through canals between the bookshelfs; Williams 
having to walk across a sea of living faces as he enters Hell; valleys 
and oceans filled with castles and cities that have been constructed out 
of works by classical masters amongst which people nonchalantly fly; 
houses casually sitting amidst the Gothic arches of the roof of an 
inverted cathedral. In an extraordinary synthesis of artistic vision and 
cutting edge digital effects technology, Ward gets to literally paint on 
film. In the most wondrous section Robin Williams steps into a landscape 
that is a Van Gogh painting come to life, slipping and sliding through 
the paint of some of the giddiest and brightest oil colours imaginable. 
The sheer breadth of Ward's vision is astounding.
One of Ward's failings in the past has been a fascination with imagery 
at the expense of emotional soul. But thanks to a good cast and an 
especially strong script, he has ample compensation here (apart from 
Annabella Sciorra whose bland performance makes one wonder what 
Williams's love is really all about). The film's humanist reworking of 
the Orpheus and Eurydice legend at the climax is emotionally powerful. A 
landmark achievement.

Kleszczewski, Nicholas
Years ago, Robin Williams made _Jumanji_, a brilliant achievement in
special effects, but a travesty on nearly every other level.  The same
can be said for _What Dreams May Come_, a boring, illogical,
weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb.
Don't get me wrong:  I love breathtaking special effects and
pulse-pounding imagery.  _Brazil_ is on my personal top ten.  _The City
of Lost Children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios.
I even love _2001_ and _Last Year at Marienbad_, being in the minority
amidst my friends.  _What Dreams May Come_, imagery aside, has little
daring thought to complement its imagery.  The daring thought it _does_
have is never fully realized.  It's idea of a plot is so lukewarm, that
it insults the bigger questions it raises.
It would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live
action sequences, put on an electronica soundtrack, and sell it as one
of those popular _Mind's Eye_ videos.
Robin Williams plays Chris Nielsen, who dies too prematurely--not only
in the story, but before we have a chance to really know and care for
him.  The director, Vincent Ward, and the screenwriter Ronald Bass, have
chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground
story focus on his experience with the afterlife.
Big mistake.  It would have been far better to take the half-hour or so
needed to tell his life story first (ala _It's a Wonderful Life_), so
that I can build up respect for him, so I could know and possibly care
for him, his children, and his long-suffering wife (played superbly by
Annabella Sciorra). Instead, the filmmakers insult my intelligence by
rushing into the story, expecting that the film to grow in depth as it
progresses.  It doesn't.
So in the afterlife, Chris learns that (a) people still don't meet God,
(b) that our thoughts are reality, and (c) time does not exist there.
Hmm...  I+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of  the
narrative.  (The "not meeting God" part still irks at me, but perhaps
there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect).  That
said, this alternate reality still makes no possible sense.  Read on...
Chris' wife commits suicide.  Since suicides go to hell, Chris would be
separated from his wife forever.  The important question is, is heaven
really heaven if you are separated from the one you love?  Good
question.
And I like good thought-provoking questions.  I don+t like it when the
filmmakers deviate from the question.  I _loathe_ it when the filmmakers
deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue
film, especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying
premise seriously.  I _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer
run by logic, but by special effects.
Hey Chris: did you forget?  Your thoughts are _real_.  They are more
_real_ than the physical world, according to the new-age screenplay.
So, why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of Annie, and let that
run wild?  And then she would appear before you, and you two would live
in happy bliss for eternity?
Because there would be no movie, that+s why.  And Albert the angel
(played by miscast Cuba Gooding, Jr.) says bluntly: "That+s fantasy."
Umm... if your thoughts are more real than the physical, then fantasy is
not fantasy, but real.  Surely some Eastern meditation specialist would
be able to tell you that.  And if you happen to think that you are an
unimaginative person, and that your thoughts aren't big enough to
sustain you for eternity, well, in all due respect, that's why I don't
subscribe to this theology.  All due respect.
Another idea, based on "Time, (pause), does not exist here!"  So Chris,
spend your eternity with Annie, as she is on earth, reliving your
favorite memories, or hang out with her when she was growing up.  You+ve
got eternity: perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to
freak her out.  And forcing her to write "I still exist" in her diary,
IMO, is just too tacky.
There are many other ideas, all of which are a hundred times better than
what+s unraveled in the plot.  The great aforementioned question is
sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before, and just
come out stale.  Most insulting is the subplot where important people in
Chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects, so when they
finally show themselves, he realizes they were with him all along.  And
when this happens, the film runs in slow motion, as if to build emotion.
_Gag me with a spoon_.
So the only things for me to like are Sciorra+s effective performance,
who rises far above this mundane material, and the special effects.
Please note that while I enjoyed some of the visuals, I did not enjoy
_all_ of them: some of the images looked like Sandy Duncan universe,
everybody floating up and down in invisible strings.
It sounds like a joke, but it+s really true: I really tried to block out
the dialogue, and figure out what music would best work as an
alternative soundtrack.  My vote goes to a rare CD called "Never Say
Die"(1981) from Petra, a Christian rock group.  It+s pretty good, and
they have a song about Annie, who commits suicide.  (It+s too late for
Annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and
now we wish we could/but it+s too late...).  Melancholic, yes.
Depressing, yes.  But far more entertaining...
So, in case you don+t know, let me be straight.  Suicide--BAD.  _DON+T
DO IT_.  No.  No.  No.  (Got it?--you shouldn+t have to pay $7.50 to
hear this in an awful Robin Williams schmaltzfest.)

What Dreams May Come is a visually rich film without a well-thought-out
story to give it depth.  This tale of the afterlife makes for some good
eye candy, but little else.
Robin Williams stars as Chris Nielsen, a successful pediatrician with a
beautiful wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), two great kids (Jessica
Brooks Grant and Josh Paddock), and a wonderful life... until about five
minutes in, that is. You see, Chris faces an untimely death, and most of
the film is concerned with his adventures in the afterlife.
Giving him a helping hand in Heaven is his old mentor, Albert (Cuba
Gooding Jr.).  Everyone creates their own Heaven, from their
subconscious thoughts and dreams.  Chris' personal afterlife is based
upon his beloved wife's paintings...literally a world beautifully
created from paint.
It seems that Chris and Annie are soulmates.  Even though he is in a
world where he can have nearly everything he wants...Chris wants to
reunite with Annie.  With the help of a tracker (Max Von Sydow), Chris
begins a quest...to reunite with his wife.
The imagery throughout What Dreams May Come is simply breathtaking. The
afterlife is rendered with a captivatingly original vision.  However, it
is so well done, that the Earthly scenes can't compete.  Chris' Earthly
life seems moribund and uninteresting...a crucial flaw, since the entire
plot involves Chris' struggle to reconcile that life.
The film struggles for deep meaning, but can't escape its simplicity.
Chris' entire life is distilled into only four total friends and family
members. Wasn't there anyone else to whom he was close?  Relatives?
Friends? Childhood pets?  Apparently not.  Even in his past lives (a
subject which the film brings up on several occasions...but never truly
explores).
In fact, "unexplored" is a good word to sum up many of the faults of
What Dreams May Come.  The film brings up plenty of potentially
interesting ideas...then proceeds to ignore them.  For example, we are
treated to one example of a soul in heaven playing a prank on another
soul.  Can conflict exist in the afterlife?  Assuming that the souls are
immortal and can suffer no jeopardy...what is to prevent it?
Even in its Earthly details, the film's oversimplification is damaging.
Chris' dilemmas seem to spring out of nothingness, since we know very
little about his life.  For example, there's a scene where Chris
encounters a man who may be his father.  But since we never knew his
father before...what kind of man he was, or his relationship with
Chris...the scene is completely robbed from its impact.
The film might have been better served by a stricter chronological
order.  Telling its tale in flashbacks does give the film the
opportunity to gradually uncover its story, but leaves the film without
any foundation to build upon.  As it stands, the opening of the film
feels hopelessly rushed, and all of Chris' latter problems seem utterly
contrived.
Robin Williams falls back upon his "warm-and-fuzzy" style of dramatic
acting here.  It suffices to get the movie from Point A to Point B, but
fails to draw the audience deeply into his character...we never get to
see Chris Nielsen as a real person.
What Dreams May Come may masquerade as a philosophical journey through
Heaven and Hell, but in reality, it's a colorful film in search of
substance.

Starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Annabella Sciorra, Max von
Sydow, Jessica Brooks, Josh Paddock and Rosalind Chao 
Rated PG-13 for very mature themes and mild profanity 
"What Dreams May Come" is like two movies in one. On one hand, it's one of
the most manipulative, dry, boring and even silly dramas I've ever seen.
The title may come from a quote from "Hamlet", but believe me; "Hamlet" it
ain't. Also, Vincent Ward's direction is so self-indulgent it's almost
laughable. But on another, much more positive note, it is the most
breathtakingly beautiful film this critic has ever seen. No other movie in
the history of cinema has taken me on such a sensory journey for the senses
and, above all, the imagination. There are shots in this film that will
literally make your mouth drop open. In my mind, there is absolutely no
question as to what should/will pick up some Oscars in March for
cinematography and art direction. 
However, as visually stunning as "Dreams" is, the monotonous and rather
shallow narrative really bogs it down. Despite predictably great
performances from the film's two leads, Robin Williams (who may be looking
at another nomination, if he doesn't nab one for the up-coming "Patch
Adams") and Annabella Sciorra, it never really rises out of the hole it dug
itself into to become the truly great film experience that it should have
been. Something with this much potential can't afford any screw-ups. 
The story starts out promising, but as I said, gets increasingly
predictable and silly. Williams is Chris Nielsen, a married doctor mourning
the recent deaths of his two children (Jessica Brooks and Josh Paddock),
who died in a car wreck. In a coincidence even the film seems to find
extreme, Chris dies a short time later in yet another car crash trying to
save someone else's life. 
Chris is taken to Heaven (though not immediately), where he meets an old
doctor friend of his now acting as his guide and companion in his own
version of the afterlife. For a short time, Chris runs free, enjoying the
unparalleled pleasures of the kingdom of God. 
Here is where the strong art direction and cinematography kick in.
Williams' vision of Heaven is so unique and, for lack of a better word,
revolutionary, that I just sat in my seat and gawked at what I was seeing. 
After a while, it is found out that Chris' wife Annie, distraught over her
recent losses, took her own life and is now condemned to an eternity in
Hell. Only with the help of another guide called, plainly enough, The
Tracker (Max von Sydow - is anyone surprised?) will Chris be able to travel
to the underworld and bring back the woman he loves. 
It is also worth noting that the film's vision of Hell are equally as
stunning as Heaven's. It is still beautiful and brilliantly realized, only
in a much darker and more disturbing way. 
All in all, director Ward took what had the potential to be the very best
of '98s films, put in some stupid plot twists (the "twists" that I'm
referring to occur not once, not twice, but three times during the movie.
The only problem is, it's the same twist over and over!) and slapped on a
happy, smilely and way to sappy ending, all to assure box office results.
Note to Hollywood; when you have great material, put it in the hands of a
capable filmmaker.

Ingredients: Heaven, hell, life after death
Starring: Robin Williams Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra
Synopsis: 
During his life, a guy named Christy (Robin Williams) finds his soulmate
in a girl named Annie (Annabella Sciorra), marries her, and fathers
children. After death, Christy explores heaven, but finds life empty
without his wife and children, so he goes searching for them. Annie is
hardest to find because she's not in heaven.
Opinion:
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is colorful and daring in its vision because it
attempts to portray the imaginary universe of life after death, and how
the soul of an individual can see beyond the material world and in fact
create entire universes. In its portrayal of heaven, hell, and life
after death, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visually exciting and wonderful
movie and a successful blend of computer technology with movie-making. 
That being said, despite good acting and imaginative concepts of life
after death, the plot of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is entirely staid and
predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise to anyone. The movie's
main value lies in its ability to inspire.

Almost all movies start on paper somewhere - perhaps something a
production exec scribbles on paper during lunch or an idea that a writer
beats around in his head awhile before scripting a rough draft. From
there, if it sounds good, the thing gets pitched to a studio that might
be interested; if so, the movie is greenlighted into a production phase.
Considering this process for Vincent Ward's latest drama, WHAT DREAMS
MAY COME, it's possible to think that everything sounded good until the
movie was actually laid on plastic and sent to movie theaters
nationwide. And in all fairness, it most likely was a good idea. But in
this case, it's just one good idea that wasn't suited for film. 
It's possible to see the shortcomings of DREAMS at the outset. Director
Ward wants to work with a very metaphysical and esoteric concept for two
hours, while simultaneously trying to mix solid drama and a sprinkling
of Robin William's characteristic wit. It doesn't work, for there's just
too much going on in his head for everything to come together onscreen.
At times, the movie reaches inspiring levels of thought-provoking
scripting, but these arrive at unexepected moments and it's likely that
the audience will miss many of them. As a whole, the script is not very
well done for such a good idea. It's a very muddled foray into an area
of screenwriting that takes a very committed and experienced writer to
perform well in. Writer Ronald Bass, basing it on the Richard Matheson
novel, certainly has experience (RAIN MAN), but he doesn't have
commitment, and the movie suffers because of it. 
The cast has the goods but does not deliver. Williams is fun to watch,
but he lacks the flair that he had in GOOD WILL HUNTING, and,
ultimately, DEAD POETS SOCIETY. Here, he plays the lead of Chris
Nielsen. Chris meets the lovely artist Annie (Annabella Sciorra) while
on vacation in Europe, and the two fall in love and are married soon
after. They have two kids, but not long after the movie's opening
credits are the children killed off in a car accident. The couple
suffers but survives until Chris is also killed in a car accident. He
goes to Heaven, which, for him, is composed of his wife's paintings.
It's there that he meets spiritual tour guide Al (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who
gets him to know the hereafter. Back on Earth, Annie can't take the
grief of losing her entire family and commits suicide; she goes to Hell.
When Chris learns of this, he takes Al and an ancient netherworld
tracker (Max von Sydow) on a journey to Hell to find Annie. 
The rest of the cast is rather drab, including Cuba Gooding Jr. Gooding
had showed promise after his Academy Award-winning performance in JERRY
MAGUIRE and a delightful turn in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Here, his job seems
forced, and he doesn't fully become the character. The only one to lend
any substance is Annabella Sciorra, who provides a solid sense of
motivation for Williams' character. This rather mediocre cast doesn't
help the script any, and so the movie's truly redeeming facets are the
special effects and set design. WHAT DREAMS MAY COME makes very dynamic
use of extreme color and lack thereof; the movie has a very powerful
vision. It's watchable for the most part, but not extremely so. And
unfortunately, it's about a subject that won't fly well with everyone,
so you may have trouble convincing yourself that this one's worth the
bucket of popcorn.

Robin Williams, this time without a beard, returns to drama in this sloppy,
sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible
effects. He plays Chris Nielsen, who meets Annie (Annabella Sciora) and
promptly marries her. They have two great kids, who sadly die in a car
crash. Just when it couldn't get any worse, Chris gets killed in a car
crash, and goes to Heaven where he meets his guide Albert (Gooding Jnr.)
Annie can't take the grief anymore, and kills herself. (All sounding like
good fun so far?) The 'penalty' for suicide is to go to Hell, and Chris goes
on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the Traveller (Max Von
Sydow.)
Based on a novel by Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson, What Dreams May
Come is clunky, manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar.
This is the worse Spielberg film Spielberg never made. Everything is wrong
about this movie: the performances are forced, and the audiences fail to
relate to any of the characters. Williams puts on a convincing upset face,
but that's all it is: a face. There's no emotion behind it. Sciora's
performance is lazy, and bogs down the whole film. She may look pretty, but
she can't act. Max Von Sydow is O.K as the traveller, if nothing special.
Cuba Gooding Jnr, thankfully, adds some bounce to his performance, and is
certainly the best performer in the film. It's a shame that his character is
so flat and 2-D, and offers no room for improvement.
All the performers have to work with a soppy script, that tries it's best to
get some emotion going, but never takes off the ground. There are _some_
scenes which could be real heartwarmers, but the faceless characters don't
help to get anything out of the performers. While films like E.T used great
actors, music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene, What
Dreams May Come is haphazard, expecting the emotion to come out of the scene
automatically. Instead, it's all rather boring. Sure, the music is pretty
(by Michael Kamen) and the cinematography isn't bad (by Eduardo Serra) but
there's something lacking. The script doesn't help, filled with hopeless
romantic clichés, and dud speeches. Richard Matheson can write some awesome
science fiction stories, sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a
bargain bin, let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for Robin
Williams.
Despite being set in Heaven, What Dreams May Come is mightily depressing.
The film rushes a happy ending, but everything before this is very, very sad
and black, which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid.
But there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie: the special
effects. Heaven and Hell are truly incredible places, and the actors fit
perfectly with the virtual sets. But despite this, What Dreams May Come,
proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998. Instead of
raising questions about existence, it raises boredom. Sadly, I recommend you
give this film a miss. Better luck next time, Robin.

  Remember that song, "When at last our life on earth is
through,/ I will share eternity with you..."?  You've got to like
someone quite a bit to want that, and in "What Dreams May
Come" the world has finally found just that sort of person. 
With a title that pretentiously derives from Shakespeare's
"Hamlet" and a theme that resonates from "Romeo and
Juliet," "What Dreams May Come" is a leading contender for
the year's raspberry awards--perhaps the silliest film since
"The Postman."  The screenplay, such as it is, is by Ron
Bass, who wrote the script to "The Rainman," but perhaps the
credits got it wrong: it seems to have been written by The
Rainman.  As co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. records in the
production notes, one of his lines is "Thought is real and
physical is the illusion."  This is presumably his idea of one of
the better lines in the narrative.  
   The subject of the afterlife, of what happens to us after we
die, has fascinated people for millenia.  We wonder about
reincarnation, westerners perhaps hoping for it while Hindus
consider it a punishment.  We wonder as well about love in all
its ramifications.  Love and death: not only the title of one of
Woody Allen's funniest films but the two subjects that
preoccupy us the most.  It's no wonder that these themes and
also their most cinematic equivalents, sex and violence, have
been the principal focus of poets, philosophers, and
theologians for centuries and filmmakers for a hundred years. 
Combine the two in a single story and you have the potential
makings of big box office.  But treat the subjects as though
you're condescending to a mass audience, challenging them
to understand Great Ideas while dishing out nothing but
affected pap and you're likely to have a flop on your hands.
   "What Dreams May Come" features Robin Williams (who,
like Woody Allen, should stick to comedy), Cuba Gooding Jr.
(likewise), Annabella Sciorra (who is so stunning that even
with a bad rug and crippled colloquy she's a pleasure to
watch), and Max von Sydow (who appears throughout in such
psychic pain and embarrassment he could probably use an
exorcist).  When Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a doctor who
is able charm a smile out of a migrainous child, dies after a
gruesome auto accident (he is apparently hit on the head by
a flying vehicle), he goes to heaven, and since heaven's
reality is nothing more or less than our thoughts, he is
plunged into the colorful world of his wife's impressionistic
paintings.  He runs into Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is
actually an incarnation of someone he admired on earth, and
is advised that human beings are not their arms or legs or
heart or even their brain.  "The brain is just meat," he
instructs, assuring Chris that we are our thoughts.  So Chris
just keeps conjuring up the lovely paintings of his wife Annie
(Annabella Sciorra) and watches the trees turn into Monets
and even sinks into a pool of paint.  He changes the colors of
a bird faster than a 400 mHz computer with an expert
keyboarder could do the trick.  Meanwhile Annie, having
recently cracked up because both of her children had
previously died in a car accident for which she blames herself,
decides she cannot live without family. She commits suicide
and goes below.  Since hell hath no fury like a man forlorn,
Chris walks, runs and flies to her place of perdition, guided by
The Tracker (Max Von Sydow).  What ultimately happens to
man and wife after they meet is anybody's guess.  Their pet
Dalmation, the only actor too discrete to allow her name to
appear in the credits, is the only rational being in the
narrative.
   It's unfortunate because you'll rarely unearth another film
with such visual imagination and glorious use of color.  When
Chris makes his perigrinations through heaven, the big screen
is awash in all the colors and imaginative design that have
contributed to the reputations of nineteenth century painters
such as Monet and Van Gogh.  His flights over hills and
valleys could have inspired Magritte, his stomping across a
sea of talking heads would please many a German
expressionist.  Since the production insists on a
Shakesperean quote for its title, i.e. Hamlet, Act III, scene i,
it's only fair for the audience to come up with its own.  How
about the one from Richard III, Act I scene iv, "O, I have
passed a miserable night!"

     One of my favorite writers is Richard Matheson who represents to
me the Twilight Zone sort of fiction that I enjoyed so much when I was
growing up.  His writing spans science fiction and horror; it spans
books, magazines, TV, and film work.  Stephen King cites Matheson as a
very strong influence on his writing, and justifiably so.  Matheson is
probably the major American writer to take horror and move it from
Transylvanian castles to places like American suburbs.  The only
Matheson novel I have ever not liked was a horrible sugary view of
heaven called WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  At the time I read it I had
speculated that Matheson had recently lost a loved one and had to get
that death out of his system somehow.  I assumed that his way to do it
was to write a novel that would give him comfort.  It did not do much
for me.  The novel has been published alone and bound with a Matheson
companion novel BID TIME RETURN, basis of the film SOMEWHERE IN TIME.
The two novels together form his sentimental works.
     One is pulled in two very different directions by WHAT DREAMS MAY
COME.  The story is still the treacle that Matheson wrote.  But the
visual imagery is spectacular to use a word that gets used too often
and should be reserved for a film like this.  I have not seen very many
films done this beautifully in my life.  Matheson's novel has been
transformed into a new Divine Comedy for our times.  And like the
original "Divine Comedy" of Dante, the story is wretched and the
imagery is totally enchanting.  (Okay, that is a personal opinion on
Dante).
     Chris Nielsen (played by Robin Williams) and Annie Nielsen
(Annabella Sciorra) have more love in their lives than is really safe
to have.  They love each other so much that it is almost perverse.
They also love 19th century painting.  They love their two children.
They love their pet dog.  But their marriage is marked by tragedy.
Death has claimed first their dog and then their two children.  Four
years after an automobile accident has claimed the two children
physician Chris stops to be a Good Samaritan in a traffic tunnel
accident.  In a flash he is the last in a line deaths that Annie has
had to face.   But the point of view is not Annie's but Chris's.  He
finds himself first in a middle world where his ghost haunts Annie,
then it moves on to heaven.  Chris is guided through the lands of death
by a Virgil-like angel figure named Albert (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).
     And what a place heaven is!  For Chris, heaven is in three
dimensions what a beautiful 19th century painting is in only two.
Everywhere he looks from every angle what he sees is a beautiful
painting.  And who comes bounding up but his dog, no longer old and
feeble but young and vibrant.  Chris loves heaven.  The dog loves
heaven.  Chris will be angelically happy here... at least for the first
two weeks.  We get to see Chris's heaven, we get to see the heaven of
some other people.  And Chris gets to work out his problems.  But then
something happens.  This something will lead Chris on an adventure
seeing more of this metaphysical world including a visit to hell.
     Vincent Ward, director of THE NAVIGATOR and MAP OF THE HUMAN
HEART, gets from both Robin Williams and from Annabella Sciorra
performances that are unselfconsciously unctuous.  Cuba Gooding, Jr.
comes off as benevolent and dull.  But then even the plot twists are
dull and have a "so-what?" feel about them.  Max Von Sydow adds a
Bergman-esque touch appropriate to this world.  (There is one minor
problem I can help the viewer through right now.  When there are
references to the Nielsen's daughter, they are referring to the younger
child.  Marie Nielsen, played by Jessica Brooks Grant, is deceptively
boyish looking but proves to be a girl.)
     But then there are the visuals.  And if you just turn off your
mind and look at the screen, all plot problems can easily be forgiven.
Most artistic visualizations of heaven are saccharine.  People have a
natural interest in hell most visualizations of heaven are not all that
interesting.  This film manages to make heaven almost as interesting as
hell... but in a different way.
     It is really difficult to rate a film with such extremes of
quality.  The story is nothing impressive, but some of the images are
breathtaking.  On balance I have to rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

It's terribly frustrating to have read a book that no-one else you know 
has.  As it stands, I know but one other person who has read Richard 
Matheson's life-after-death novel 'What Dreams May Come', and that's 
only because I made her read it over a decade ago.  Now that the film 
version has hit the screens, I find myself at another level of 
frustration: that the film and the book are not quite the same thing, 
and I'm right back where I started from.  I still can't share the 
experience.
This shouldn't come as any surprise.  Matheson's intensively-researched 
novel was captivating because it took subject matter that was 
dangerously new-agey, pseudo-religious, or just plain gooey, and turned 
into something that managed to be thoughtful and somehow authentic.  
Obviously, such metaphysics lend themselves to the printed page more 
readily than the cinema screen, which is why I had never entertained for 
a second the idea that this book would ever be made into a film.  Yet 
here it is, with NZ director Vincent Ward at the helm.  So far, so good.  
Ward has a history of powerful visual imagery in his work to date and is 
an intelligent, discerning film-maker.  This is also the director who 
walked out on his first Hollywood assignment (ALIEN 3) as soon as it 
departed from his original concept and has refrained from taking on any 
other project since, so it would seem safe to assume that Ward would 
handle Matheson's book with some integrity.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is titled after Hamlet's famous soliloquy about 
death, so it should not come as much of a surprise when Chris Neilsen 
(Robin Williams) shuffles off his mortal coil ten minutes into the story 
and eventually finds his way to an afterlife created by visual cues from 
the memories of those who inhabit it.  There is no judgment in this 
world, no heaven or hell save their simulacra.  For a while we share 
Chris' exploration of his new world, and it is as blissful as any you 
could imagine; but, as David Byrne says, heaven is a place where nothing 
ever happens, so it isn't too long before Chris is going further afield 
(read: hell) to reconcile himself with his wife Annie (Annabella 
Sciorra).  
The first half of Ward's film depicts a heaven-world so beautifully 
realized that it's almost as if he and his crew went there to get 
location footage.  It is like nothing else you've ever seen on film.  
For a while the vivid colors and intricate detail make this a spectacle 
which can be seen only on a large canvas.  But then something peculiar 
happens - as the story shifts from heaven-world to hell-world, the 
visuals become less impressive.  Furthermore, just at the point where 
Chris is finally taking action and doing something, the story gets piled 
up with flashbacks that interrupt the narrative and prevent his quest 
from becoming the epic it deserves.  Given the impressionistic, 
painterly world of 'Summerland' (as Matheson refers to it), it's only 
natural to expect Hell to be influenced by the works of Bosch, Hogarth, 
or even Gustave Dore.  Initially, the journey is promising (I like the 
way that Chris and Annie's initial boating encounter is perverted into a 
shoreline of wrecked vessels) but in the end Hell becomes gloomy and 
run-down, and Ward shoots most of the sequences there with Williams and 
Sciorra in close-up so that we don't even really get to see a lot of it.  
This may all be a dubious strategy on his part: just as the devil gets 
all the good lines, it is easy for a dramatic, chaotic hell to upstage a 
meditative, placid heaven.  So Ward's solution is to make Hell boring.  
After ten minutes we're pining for the wide open spaces of Summerland 
again, which is where everyone in this story belongs, and of course, 
ends up.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a difficult film to gauge - you don't want to be 
unfair to it because it does manage to take you places you haven't seen 
before in the movies.  Yet the journey may just be too careful, too 
measured, and too contemplative for its own good, which is why it is not 
for all tastes (although anybody who is genuinely interested in film 
should check it out for its cinematic qualities alone).  Also, for a 
non-religious afterlife there seems to be an excess of guilt around, 
which gets a little wearying.  And even after Chris gets everything he 
wants, he still wants to get back to the 'real' world.  It's just as 
Schopenhauer has always said: satisfaction in human beings is 
impossible, because whenever one desire is fulfilled, ten others jump in 
their place; and even if they were all fulfilled, satisfaction would 
only become boredom.  I guess we all know this deep inside, which is why 
the final scene doesn't seem as corny as it otherwise might (the last 
line is really sweet, in a karmic kinda way). 
I appreciate the intelligence behind this film and the bold way it is 
set almost entirely in the afterlife, and ultimately, I felt that it did 
not do the book a disservice (as for visualizations of hell, it still 
doesn't beat a Strontium Dog comic I read serialized in 2000 A.D. when I 
was a teenager), and I suppose I should be satisfied with that: yes, it 
takes us into Hamlet's 'undiscovered country', and quite convincingly.  
It does at least make me want to read the book again.  And maybe this 
time I won't be the only one.  So if you liked the movie, read the 
novel.  And if you didn't like the movie...well, read it anyway.

        In some respects, "What Dreams May Come" reminds me of
Richard Bach's "Johnathan Livingston Seagull," a book which
sparked my imagination with an intensity that few other works
of art have ever equaled.  It was a novel that challenged the
way I approached the very concepts of religion and spirituality.
Although I didn't agree with every aspect of the story (and still
don't, incidentally), the sheer beauty of its presentation was more
than enough to make up for its shortcomings; when I finished
reading it, I found myself deeply moved by both its power and
message.  Walking out of an opening-day screening of "What Dreams
May Come," I felt a similar sense of awe... even though, once again,
I didn't agree with everything that was said.
        A brief collection of scenes, displayed during the film's
opening credits, sets the plot in motion.  Chris Nielsen (Robin
Williams) and his wife Annie (Annabella Sciora) meet while on
vacation in Europe; soon, they fall in love and marry.  They
eventaully have two children, but Fate has a nasty shock in store:
both kids are killed in a car accident while in their teens.  Annie,
who asked the housekeeper to drive the kids to school that day,
blames herself for their deaths, figuring that things may have
turned out differently if she'd been behind the wheel.  Years pass,
and the couple's emotional wounds slowly heal.  Then one day, Chris
offers to run an errand for Annie; while doing so, he is killed in
another car accident.
        Chris's soul, after coming to terms with his death, makes
the journey up to Heaven.  He finds a place of such astonishing
beauty that I will not even attempt to describe it with words;
suffice it to say that the film's visuals are among the most
awe-inspiring ever captured on celluloid.  Heaven, it seems, is
somewhat like the Holodeck from "Star Trek": it can be completely
customized, based on the wishes of its occupant.  Everyone's Heaven
is different: because Chris was such a fan of art in life, he
chooses to live in a world comprised of painted landscapes, like
those Annie used to create.  Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Chris's
spirit guide and friend, teaches him to manipulate his environment,
and in time Chris is even reunited with his children.  The only
thing missing from his world is Annie, who he wistfully watches
from afar.
        But Annie, nearly comatose with grief after losing her entire
family, decides that she no longer has any reason to live; soon
after Chris's death, she takes her own life.  Chris assumes that his
wife will now join him in eternal paradise, but it is not to be:
suicide victims are forever barred from the rewards of the afterlife,
and he can only watch helplessly as Annie is sent to Hell.  Despite
the wonders of Heaven and the reunion with his children, Chris
refuses to spend eternity without his soulmate, and decides to
gamble his own soul in a desperate attempt to save her.
        To say that Robin Williams is excellent in his role would
be redundant, as the man is incapable of being anything less; also,
Cuba Gooding Jr. is the very picture of warmth and patience as the
understanding spirit who helps Chris make the awkward adjustment
from life into death.  Best of all may be Annabella Sciora's
portrayl of Annie: it's she who undergoes the greatest number of
emotional changes over the course of the story, yet she always
remains a fascinating (if occasionally unsympathetic) character.
But Max von Sydow, who plays a helpful "soul mercenary" named The
Tracker, is significantly less interesting: he adds little to
the story except some vaugely philosophical dialogue that doesn't
really go anywhere.
        The truth is, the characters in this film take a back seat
to the experience of just *watching* the thing; in that regard, I
was reminded of "Brazil" and "2001: A Space Odyssey."  The movie is
far from perfect, and the unneccessarily "cute" final scene does much
to undermine the previous fifteen minutes of the story, all so
the filmmakers' can make the audience go "Aww."  The biggest problem,
however, is the simple fact that we don't see enough of our heroes'
"lives" after they die; instead, the film presents us with so many
tedious flashbacks that the story screeches to a halt nearly every
time one appears on the screen.  In addition, the cloying score from
composer Michael Kamen actually crosses that fine line which separates
sentimentality from self-indulgence, and we're forced to listen to him
throttle the audience's emotions with a sweeping arrangement of
strings that never lets you forget that you're supposed to be sobbing
into your popcorn.  It's even worse than the score for "Volcano," a
feat I thought was impossible.
        But none of that really matters.  "What Dreams May Come" is
so strikingly original that it's worthy of respect and serious
analysis, despite the occasional flaw.  There's an undeniable
grandeur to the production, an epic quality that raises the film
from mere cinema into a sensory odyssey.  Director Vincent Ward had
no interest in making a timid film, and indeed he hasn't; for that
reason, I'm willing to give the story some slack.  I highly
recommend that you see this movie with several of your closest
friends.  Afterwards, go get a cup of coffee and discuss what you
just saw.  I promise, it'll keep you talking for the rest of the
evening... and maybe the whole week.

I've always been told that there are two things in life that are
unavoidable - death and taxes. Oddly, I've never given much thought to
either of the two.  Maybe if I did, at least I'd stop getting
collection notices from Uncle Sam.  Yes, let me make a resolution to
devote myself to better record keeping, hold on to all my receipts,
and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are
mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties.  It seems that
the issue of death may not be so different, at least envisioned here
in this film.  As this tender love story goes, if you do good things
and have a clear conscience when you die, you ascend to a place of
great peace and beauty.  The dreams, wishes, and fantasies that you
had when you were alive come true.  For those who die with a burdened
soul, however, they wind up in that other place.
Chris and Annie (a winsome Robin Williams and a radiant Annabella
Sciorra) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has
to offer.  Their love for each other is strong and their bond is
undeniable.  But tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of
Annie's happiness.  And when Chris dies after a terrible car accident,
she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself.   Despair is
perhaps the greatest sin, and she will wallow in her guilt throughout
eternity.  Chris, on the other hand, has made it to heaven, and upon
learning of Annie's fate, he journeys to Hell to find her and to try
to free her from her nightmare.
This film brims with imagination, containing a lush imagery that shows
the arcadia that is Heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that
is Hell.  It seems that Heaven and Hell could very well be a product
of our fantasies or nightmares.  It's shape and look is as infinite as
our imagination.  As Chris explores his new fantastic world and
discovers things both amazing and wondrous, he also begins to learn
more about himself.  Certain questions baffle him at first.  Why does
his home in heaven ooze with paint?  What is the significance of the
Asian stewardess?  Why does he have an all-too-willing guide (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.) to help him find Annie?  But as he slowly begins to
realize the answers, it makes him stronger and gives him a greater
chance to save Annie.
"Dreams" is both visually and tellingly beautiful.  Alas, I have one
regret.  The movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed,
but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying.  It seemed as if it was
racing to some kind of great finish, but its intensity seemed to wane
in its final moments.  However, your eyes will still well up with
tears and you'll find lots to savor.  The storytelling is purposeful
and well constructed.  The journey is imaginative.  And I was
surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.

**1/2 (out of 4) WHAT DREAMS MAY COME breaks new ground. The special
effects that make Heaven look like a romantic-era painting are
astounding and outstanding. The story is okay, but it alone shouldn't
get you into the theater. You should be going for the visual treat. 
Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a doctor, is on his way home when he
comes upon a car crash. He runs to the injured victim to give aid.
Another car fails to slow down and smashes into Chris, killing him.
After a short stint as a ghost, Chris heads up to Heaven where his guide
Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) shows him the ropes. 
Chris and his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) shared a love of romantic
paintings, so Chris' version of heaven is made of, and made to look
like, paint. Chris' fanciful heaven fills the big screen and it looks
wonderful. The sky is full of blue brushstrokes, the ground is covered
with vibrantly colored flowers that turn into goopy paint when touched.
A minimalist bird swims through the painted sky. There are only a
handful of shots where you get to see his painted heaven, but they alone
are worth the price of admission. 
After he gets over the beauty of his heaven, (and turns it back into
something more closely resembling reality, something less costly to
film), Chris recalls his life in a series of flashbacks. Chris loved his
wife Annie too much and his kids not enough. Both of his kids died
before him (also in a car crash). Annie took their deaths very hard - so
hard she had to be committed to an institution. Chris on the other hand
let go, perhaps a little too easily. The difference in the way they
dealt with the loss of their children nearly forced Chris and Annie to
split. Her profound sadness was a place where he could not join her. 
Chris is just getting used to Heaven when Albert brings him news of
Annie's death. Annie has committed suicide. Suicides, the movie tells
us, automatically go to "the other place." Chris again lets go of his
children in favor of his wife. Instead of looking them up in Heaven, he
makes that heroic journey into Hell to save her soul. 
Done right, Ward and screenwriter Ronald Bass could have made their hero
into the next Dante or Orpheus. But the story is so full of compromises
and internal inconsistencies that Chris Nielsen will not be remembered. 
For one thing, Chris is no hero. His threadlike attachment to his kids
and slavish devotion to his wife cast a selfish shadow from him. But,
you say, common, fallible people make the BEST heroes. Maybe that's
true, but if Chris is Everyman and not a heroic figure, then he
shouldn't be the first to make the journey to and from Hell. It should
be happening all the time. 
For another, given the film's non-religious view of Heaven, it was dumb
to say that all suicides automatically go to Hell. Depression, a leading
cause of suicide, is widely recognized as a disease and not as a
character flaw. After the loss of a husband and child, a person with
depression could easily be pushed over the edge. If this film's heaven
were based on a strict religious doctrine, at least it might be
internally consistent to damn her, but by picking "rules" to fit the
story (and at the same time apologizing for those rules), the film
relinquishes any solid foundation that might have made it a great film. 
Finally, it seems like there should be some cost for stealing a soul
from Hell. This story is perfectly set up for a little tragedy. The
hints at Chris' selfishness seem to invite a little Faustian tradeoff.
Perhaps he could have been made to sacrifice something of himself in
trade for Annie's soul. But the bright and vivid tone of the movie made
that option impossible and doomed this movie to be empty calories from
the candy rack. 
In spite of these easy shortcuts, the film still has the trappings of a
good heroic journey. That is to say that Chris' journey is not really
about the journey, it's about setting his mind right. The reward comes
not because of how far he traveled, but because of how much he has
grown. If you try hard, you can make yourself see Chris as that heroic
icon, but the effort may or may not be worth it. 
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is hard to evaluate. On the one hand, its failures
were disappointing. On the other hand, it made a nice attempt on a story
that hasn't been made in recent memory. I can't fully praise it, but I
can't just write it off, either. 
The deciding factor for me was the film's incredible visual canvas. Not
only were the "painted" effects amazing, but the sets and costumes, both
in Heaven and in Hell were imaginative and apt. The overall look was
original enough and impressive enough that I can fairly recommend this
movie. 
If you're at all interested in seeing it, go now, not later. This movie
will never look as good on your TV (or at the Cinema Saver) as it will
on a big screen.

_What_Dreams_May_Come_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is, in the most literal sense, a "dream movie," a
visionary exercise in the use of dreamlike imagery, which, in turn, helps
create a sublime romantic fantasy.  The centerpiece of the film is a
breathtaking tour of the afterlife, which is taken by one Chris Nielsen
(Robin Williams) after he dies in a car accident.  But while his spirit is
in heaven, Chris's soul remains with that of his soulmate, his emotionally
fragile wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), who had never fully recovered from
the years-ago deaths, also by car accident, of their two children.
_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is nothing short of a visual marvel.  Eugenio
Zanetti's production design, Eduardo Serra's cinematography, and the
spectacular special effects supervised by Ellen M. Somers paint a wildly
imaginative vision of the afterlife.  This is quite literally the case in
the scene where Chris first arrives in Heaven, which manifests itself in
the form of one of Annie's paintings.  It is perhaps the most visually
ambitious scene in a film overflowing with visual invention, with Chris
swimming in the still-wet paint and the backdrop remaining as
two-dimensional as any canvas.
But the film is much more than a showcase for the latest in filmmaking
technology.  As with his last film, 1993's astonishing
_Map_of_the_Human_Heart_, director Vincent Ward taps into the very core of
romantic yearning, coming up with an admittedly sappy but no less poignant
tale of true, pure love.  There are some powerful moments, most notably a
scene where Annie, in a fit of anger and grief, attempts to destroy a
painting which, unknown to her, Chris and his spiritual guide Albert (Cuba
Gooding Jr.) is inside.  Of course, moments like those are carried over the
top by the efforts of the actors.  Williams, as always, is effortlessly
likable, and he and Sciorra share a natural, magical chemistry.  One has no
trouble at all believing that these two are indeed soulmates, and,
consequently, has no trouble falling under the film's entrancing spell.

Director: Vincent Ward
Writer: Ronald Bass (based on the novel by Richard Matheson)
Starring: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max von
Sydow, Rosalind Chao, Josh Paddock, Jessica Brooks, Werner Herzog
Watching "What Dreams May Come" is really one of the more bizarre
evenings (or, in my case, afternoons) I've had at the movies in quite
some time, and I mean that positively.  It's unlike any big budget
mainstream I've seen since "Dark City," and while they share the same
brilliance in artistic and technical design, they also share a true
hypnotism: sitting back and really taking everything this film has to
offer in is like getting totally lost in a movie, and any real short
comings, the amount of which may be the real difference between these
two films, are easy to ignore until afterwards, the best time for
problems to surface anyway.
The protagonist, Chris Nielsen, is played by none other than Robin
Williams, the actor who has made an entire career out of playing
bigger-than-life characters in bizarre fantasy worlds.  This time, in
what seems to be his current attempt to be taken more seriously as an
actor (and by god we do, Robin), he plays it straight, as the entire
story is a serious bit of pondering on what may happen after one dies.
But the film is not necessarily about death, and when it begins, it's
about Chris meeting his soon-to-be-wife in a Meet-Cute scene that turns
into a joyfully happy marriage.
Although Chris and his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), are happy and
have two kids (John Paddock and Jessica Brooks), they are soon struck
with tragedy when their kids are killed in a car accident.  This sends
Annie into a mental institution and somehow, Chris gets her out of it,
nurses her back, and gets her into painting as a form of therapy...then
he dies in a car accident.
The rest of the film, following this short exposition, is mostly
following Chris as he learns more and more about what happens after one
dies, like how we get our own heaven in which all of our desires come
true.  Personally, Chris ends up in one of Annie's paintings, a gorgeous
landscape of where they first met, which at first is actually made up of
acryllic paints, so when, for example, he picks up a flower from the
ground and crushes it, it turns into acryllic right in his hands.  As he
learns more, it turns into a real landscape, and he soon learns all the
other major perks of being dead: you can fly, you can breathe under
water, and everything you wish is at your command, more or less.  In
other words, it's like a much more controlled and more stable acid
trip.  Glad to know I have something to look forward to.
Along for the ride is Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), the Virgil to Chris'
Dante.  More or less, he explains things for him, though not everything
and usually after he's already discovered things.  And while he hangs
with them and another Oriental woman, Leona (Rosalind Chao), who takes
him to another heaven for a special emotional meeting, Annie is
meanwhile suffering emotional breakdown, but still desperately trying to
hang on.  Although Chris is able to communicate with her partially
before he ascends to his own heaven, it only destroys her more.  By the
mid-point, she has committed suicide, and has not wound up in heaven but
in hell, which is reserved not for the morally wicked but for those
who've committed the greatest sin: not being able to forgive one's self.
Chris ends up deciding to travel to hell to go find her, with the help
of a mysterious man dubbed The Tracker (and played by the great Max Von
Sydow, who with this, "The Seventh Seal," and "The Exorcist" - not to
mention "Needful Things" where he played Satan himself - has fully shown
he's a master of death, or something like that).  This may sound like a
typical Hollywood film from this point on, kinda like "Ghost" with
unstubtle Orpheus undertones (all Chris needs is a harp), but strangely
enough, this just seems to nicely blend with everything else as a
magical excursion to a foreign land never tred in other movies.
Visually, "What Dreams May Come" is outstanding, and is undoubtedly the
recipient of a nice Oscar nomination for Art Direction (too bad this and
"Dark City" had to come out in the same year).  The image of Chris'
heaven is like living inside components of Renaissance paintings, the
land of Myst, Angel memorablia, and Hallmark Greeting Cards.  Hell is
equally magestic, filled with an entrance that is as fiery and
frightening as we all imagined it would be (like the use of a lake to
surround the entrance to hell, as well as the use of Cerberus), while
the main part is instead a sea of faces buried into the ground, a sight
that is breathtaking and unnerrving.
This is all well and good, and luckily the rest of the movie is
wonderful as well.  The film, though obviously designed into a
traditional three act format, actually flows together quite nicely.
Each large sequence is like a mini-masterpiece unto itself of bizarro
introductions and amazing sights, and there doesn't seem to be any
filler.  This makes for a film that just pulls us right into the moment,
and works us over so much with bringing a brand new vision of the
afterlife to us that we damn near forget about plot advancement.
Unfortunately, "What Dreams May Come" has come under some serious
admonishment from other critics, who have been blasting it for its new
age thinking, such as how we can control everything in our lives and our
after-lives if we only concentrate.  While some of this is true, it's
sadly enough superfluous to the entirety of the film.  The point of this
film is not to invoke this kind of thinking onto you, unless you're so
anal that you actually pay attention to some of Albert's perplexing
explanations (did you really understand all that?), but to really take
us on a journey that's a treat to the senses, and later on the emotions.
I will say that it does have its share of problems, though, especially
in the emotion department.  For most of the film, it's a pretty
emotional experience, what with everyone in the family being dead, and
Annie left to rot out her existence, feeling unfairly guilty that she
didn't drive her kids to school the day they died and make Chris do an
errand the day he did.  In the early scenes, we really do feel a sense
of love between Chris and Annie, and some of the jokes they tell aren't
so much funny as they are sweetly romantic.  And when Chris announces he
will go get her from hell, it really has justified that decision, and
we're right along with him the whole way.
In the finale, it does get in a bit of snag, coming up with an ending
which is way too easy and chipper for a film that is so hypnotic and
complex up until that point.  With Chris seeing Annie, who doesn't
recognize him at all, and desperately trying to get her to get over the
distraught she has put herself in, it perhaps couldn't have come up with
an ending that was either very satisfying or very logical (I will give
it this, though: at least it didn't have Chris telling her "It's not
your fault.  It's not your fault.  It's not you fault," etc. etc.
etc.).  It's as if it pulls us right up to the crevice, turns right
around, and walks in the opposite direction.
Nevertheless, "What Dreams May Come" is a substantial success.  Its
power is that it hooks us in to its story emotionally and
psychologically, and pleases all of our senses with imagery and scenes
that are not to be believed.  Maybe it's because of the technical
reasons that I'm really recommending this, but at least I'm not stupid
enough to take into any major consideration the new age thinking that it
partially touches upon.

Many people will not find much to like in WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, the new film by
visionary director Vincent Ward.  Most will come to see the computer animated
landscapes and vibrant colors.  But little do they know (as I so plainly found
out) that this has quite a complex story to tell.  Walking out of the theater, I
could see the audience's disgust... one member even had to be awakened after the
film ended.  Don't believe the previews that you see... this is definitely not a
film for everyone.
This is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in
recent years.  Kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex
storyline.  The plot is just as fluid as the heaven that Ward presents to us.
It goes back and forth in time, as if it has no boundaries.  Think of the film
CITY OF ANGELS.  Now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision.
Both films deal with the afterlife, but I doubt WHAT DREAMS MAY COME will do
well at the box office.  Costing around $85 million to make, the film would have
to do extremely well in order to make it's money back.  But due to it's story, I
doubt it will.  For everyone who thought TITANIC's story was too simple and
cliche, here is proof that if James Cameron had written a more complex
screenplay, it may not have done nearly as well.
But don't get me wrong... I hope the film does do well.  It's a vision of pure
visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen.  I doubt most of us
could have thought of this place, even in our own mind.  WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is
the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals.  The only film that
surpasses it is DARK CITY.  Full of rich, shocking colors, we get to see a
heaven that most of us would probably die to get to.  But don't do that, because
you'll end up going to hell.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME begins with two boats colliding on a lake.  Chris "Christy"
Nielsen (Robin Williams) is startled by the sudden jolt, but is even more
startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat.  Annie (Annabella
Sciorra) spies Chris, as well, and both eventually bond and get married.  Annie
is an artist, whose paintings are colorful, lush, and surrealistic.  Chris is a
doctor and loves Annie more than life itself.  They also have two children,
Marie (Jessica Brooks) and Ian (Josh Paddock).  But one day, the two children
are killed in a car crash, and it almost destroys Annie.  She tries to commit
suicide, but fails, and is then put in an institution.  Chris copes with the
problem by realizing they aren't around anymore, and nothing will change that.
Just as Annie gets her life back in order, Chris is killed while trying to save
the life of a car crash victim.
Chris goes to heaven, or his version of heaven, rather.  Guided by Albert (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.), Chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy.
That is, until he realizes how miserable he is without Annie.  Prior to heaven,
he would try to comfort Annie, but the more he was around, the more pain she
felt.  Chris decides to leave her alone.  Little does he realize what will
happen next.  I'm not about to say, because the plot point is crucial to the
rest of the story (many critics, however, give it away).  Certainly, Chris dying
is crucial to the plot, but they tell you that he dies in the previews.
Story is not necessarily important for this movie to work, because it deals with
the afterlife.  However, strangely, virtually nothing is heard of God or the
Devil.  A couple of comments here and there, but the story maintains its focus
on Chris and his search for the love of his life.  "We're soul mates!" Chris
exclaims.  Heaven, in movies, is almost always depicted as a glowing city of
white, purity, and love.  Usually, it also looks like it rests among the
clouds.  But WHAT DREAMS MAY COME goes a different route.  It shows us a heaven
that most of us have never seen before.  Chris' heaven is his memories brought
to life.  His thoughts can make anything real, and he makes the paintings Annie
drew become his heaven.  "I've never seen anyone use real paint before," Albert
says.  Equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal
stereotypes of fire and brimstone.  Instead, it's a state of being.  In one
gloriously horrific scene, Chris and his "tracker" (Max von Sydow) arrive at a
sea of faces.  Thousands of heads are stuck above ground, their bodies somewhere
else.  Mostly dead silent, some quips are made, almost as if to lighten the
mood.  It's truly a frightening sequence.
Production designer Eugenio Zanetti is definitely going to be up for an Oscar
nomination.  Using state of the art computer technology, worlds are created for
exploration.  Sometimes, some scenes play out as if they are only there for the
visual impact.  It's not necessary to be there, but we appreciate seeing it.
Costume designer Yvonne Blake (who also appears in the film) has done an
incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes.
Cinematographer Eduardo Serra, whose work was last seen in the luscious WINGS OF
THE DOVE, has a difficult job, as most cinematographers do working with special
effects.  But Serra's entire universe is a computer generated image, and he does
a masterful job.  Writer Ron Bass, adapting from the novel by Richard Matheson,
provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot.  The story is extremely
vague in its details, allowing viewers to think for themselves about the
meaning.  And director Vincent Ward puts it all together into his final vision.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a good example of German expressionism which may just
turn off a good portion of the audience.  Your average movie goer more than
likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques.  The film will also definitely
draw attention from religious people, but they shouldn't take it too far.  It
is, after all, just a movie.
Robin Williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances, while
his comedic roles have been suffering.  His comedy is perfection when he makes
up his own stuff, but when is confined by a screenplay, he isn't quite as
effective.  But drama is really his strong point, and you can see that here.
It's doubtful he'll get another Oscar nomination, but I wouldn't really mind if
he did.  The real surprise here is Annabella Sciorra who impressed last year
with COP LAND.  This may be her breakout role and may garner her some much
needed attention.  It's also quite possible that she could get an Oscar
nomination.  However, the Academy doesn't like to award performances for these
types of films.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. has been better, but he's certainly not
distracting.  Max von Sydow is underused, as are Jessica Brooks and Josh
Paddock.  A treat for some movie goers is to see Werner Herzog appear (if they
even recognize him) as Chris' father lost in the sea of faces.  It's not hard to
see why Herzog would be attracted to this film, considering he thinks that
audiences are starving for great images.  Overall, it's Williams and Sciorra's
film.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is rated PG-13 for thematic elements involving death, some
disturbing images, language, and some partial nudity.  The film is definitely
aimed at a more adult audience.  Some will find the plot distracting.  Some will
find the visuals absolutely glorious.  And some will find both.  The only real
problem with the film, that I could see, was that it slows down considerably
during the midsection, just after we have been immersed in the visuals and
before the search for Annie begins.  By the way, some controversy even
surrounded the title, which was mistaken for a sexual term ("what" becomes "wet"
and you should understand).  In actuality, the title is from a soliloquy in
HAMLET.  Just thought I should let you know.

In one of the many awe-inspiring scenes in "What Dreams May Come," Chris 
Nielsen awakens inside of a beautiful painting. Tentatively, he begins to 
explore his incredible new surroundings and discovers that the paint in 
the gorgeous landscape he now occupies is not completely dry. He plucks a 
lovely blue flower and holds the blossom in his hand, admiring its hyper-
rich coloring. Then he squeezes it too hard and the flower loses its 
integrity, leaving his fingers covered with bright blue paint. Moments 
later, after surveying the glorious vista in front of him, a giddy 
Nielsen races down a lush green hill towards the lake at its base, again 
forgetting the fragility of his environment. Once more, reality begins to 
unravel and the frantic man finds himself sinking into brightly colored 
paint, his legs trapped by radiant color turned into an oozing mess. 
Much like that scene, "What Dreams May Come" is a visually breathtaking 
work that is grand to behold, but eventually loses its integrity and 
becomes an oozing mess. After promising to lead us through a bold 
adventure in the afterlife, the screenplay takes a tragic wrong turn and 
lands in a murky swamp of confusion and psychobabble.
It's a real shame, because the filmmakers' intentions are as ambitious as 
their subject is fascinating. Every man, woman and child ever born has 
speculated on the mechanics of the afterlife. The possibilities are 
limitless, but our visions are generally vague at best. Most often, we 
either imagine people in robes lounging on clouds, whiling away eternity 
playing the harp, or picture some nebulous Oz-like city with gold-paved 
streets. Movies have reflected our pedestrian notions, lazily depicting a 
bland afterlife with fog machines blowing smoke across a blue backdrop. 
Until now, only "The Green Pastures," a charming 1936 movie set in an 
idyllic, countrified Heaven, tried to show an afterlife that actually had 
a sense of place.
After studying great artists' renderings of paradise and hell, "What 
Dreams May Come" presents an afterlife comprised of many wonderfully 
imaginative and strikingly tangible worlds. The film is a banquet for the 
eyes, presenting images that range from enchanting baroque picture books 
made real to Germanic impressionist nightmares turned horribly vivid. How 
sad to see so much creativity serving such an undeserving script.
I haven't read the Richard Matheson novel on which the film is based, but 
it has to be better than Ron Bass' inadequate screenplay. The story 
introduces star-crossed lovers Chris and Annie Nielsen (Robin Williams 
and Annabella Sciorra), then quickly rips their world apart. Four years 
after the devastating loss of their two children, Chris is killed while 
trying to help victims of an automobile accident. He views the aftermath 
of his death in a ghost state, accompanied by a colorful blurred figure. 
In time, the corporeal world fades and Chris moves to a ravishing 
surrealistic realm, where the now-clear figure identifies himself as 
Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Chris' guide to the afterlife. Albert explains 
the mechanics of the domain. Thought is reality and each person creates 
their own eternity, generally starting by reconstituting their body and 
surrounding themselves with a comforting landscape. You can change forms 
and worlds at will, reunite with loved ones when you're ready, or choose 
to be reborn for another run at life on planet Earth. 
Just as Chris is beginning to adjust, enjoying a blissful reunion with 
one of his children and exploring the wonders around him, he learns that 
Annie has committed suicide, dooming herself to infinity in a hell of her 
own creation. Told that there is nothing he can do and that his feelings 
for Annie will fade in time, Chris spits out "No! We're soulmates!" and 
dives into Hades to save his beloved, joined by a mysterious figure known 
as the Tracker (Max Von Sydow).  
Handled properly, this story could have shined, but Bass turns a lyrical 
premise into a dismal bog of grandiose posturing, condescending homilies 
and convoluted dialogue, all dressed up with loads of irritatingly coy 
pop psychology. "What Dreams May Come" pretends to offer the secrets of 
the universe, but beneath all the pretentious wailing and gnashing of 
teeth, its message is trite and obvious. After being subjected to such a 
cavalcade of histrionics, we deserve revelations, damn it!
The best performances in the film come from the supporting players. 
Rosalind Chao (Keiko from a couple of "Star Trek" series) is quietly 
effective as a spirit guide and, playing the Nielsen kids, Jessica Brooks 
and Josh Paddock are direct, focused and touching. Max Von Sydow, on the 
other hand, sleepwalks through his trite role. As for Williams, Sciorra, 
and Gooding; well, they do what they usually do. 
"What Dreams May Come" warrants a visit despite its dreadful script, 
thanks to the aforementioned supporting actors and the film's incredible 
visuals. To best enjoy the experience, though, I suggest you follow this 
suggestion: ignore the words and just look at all the pretty pictures.

REVIEW: What Dreams May Come
By Luke Buckmaster (bucky@alphalink.com.au)
Cast: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max von
Sydow, Rosalind Chao, Jessica Brooks, Josh Paddock
Director: Vincent Ward
Screenplay: Ron Bass based on the novel by Richard Matheson
Cinematography: Eduardo Serra
Australian theatrical release date: October 15, 1998
Of the recent visual cinematic journeys - the dark obscurity of Dark
City, the tranquility of City of Angels and gawky lavishness of
Armageddon - none have been more revealing than the surreal environments
of heaven and hell; depicted in What Dreams May Come.  When Hollywood's
latest flavors of the month seem to be disaster sagas and teen slashers,
it's probably a good thing that post-death scenarios might well become a
hip new narrative. With this film, the above mentioned City of Angels
and 1997's Spawn, we've seen beautiful, imaginable and disturbing
afterlife images.
And trust Robin Williams to jump on the bandwagon.  It was Australian
director Peter Weir who originally took him away from comedy and placed
him in Dead Poets Society, and since then he hasn't avoided comedy so
much as he has chosen more meatier roles.  Williams is not as good in
this film as he was in The Birdcage and Good Will Hunting (two of his
finest films), but he sure tries hard.  Probably a little too hard, in
fact, since his frowning eyebrows and wrinkled forehead oozes a genuine
love for acting.
Director Vincent Ward pieces together the film in a way that hasn't been
done before, using lush visuals and stunning realism to fulfill the
daunting task of creating a believable heaven and hell (and everything
that lies in between).  In the past, when computer generated effects
haven't been as remarkable, filmmakers have often reverted to afterlives
on Earth (Ghost, City of Angels, and countless others) or yielded ones
that don't look entirely believable (Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey).  The
colorful world of the protagonist's personal heaven is wonderful to
watch, and a hell with hundreds of heads stuck in the ground is a
positively chilling experience.  Again, Ward tries a little too hard,
pulling off stunning eye candy but lacking a good amount of emotional
intrigue.
Chris Neilson (Robin Williams) is a children's doctor who dies by an
oncoming car when he assists someone caught in an accident.  Years
earlier his two children died in similar circumstances, leaving his wife
Annie (Annabella Sciorra) in mental turmoil.  Chris discovers that his
personal heaven is a world inside one of Annie's paintings, and is
guided around this wondeful place by a former mentor, Dr Albert Lewis
(Cuba Gooding Jr.).  Back on Earth, Annie commits suicide and gets a one
way ticket to hell.  Upon hearing the news, Chris is bound by love for
his wife to search her out and bring her to heaven, at the risk of
losing his own mind in the process.
Quite an intriguing idea, really, thanks to the writing skills of Ronald
Bass, a man who taught himself to read at the age of three and wrote his
first novel at seventeen.  Bass is good at his craft, but his love for
writing probably exceeds his talent for it.  He is competent enough to
yield a clever scenario, but fails to keep the screenplay witty and
shrewd.  Thus the film becomes far too lose and unstructured, as Bass
resorts to letting characters tell Chris what he can and can't do, what
he should and shouldn't do, and how he could go about doing it.
Frankly, I would have liked Chris to discover a few things for himself.
Over acting aside, Robin Williams is quite pleasing in the title role,
as is Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow (who plays hells tour guide).
Annabella Sciorra is the best of the bunch, giving a strong fell of
humanity to her role - although her performance is far from faultless.
Other cast members feel a little out of place, including Josh Paddock
and Jessica Brooks, who play the two children.
Both Robin Williams and Vincent Ward were obviously keen to make What
Dreams May Come work as well as it possibly could, and they have created
a good film; not the brilliant one it longs to be.  And the answer to
making it better isn't to try harder.

WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is one of those films that takes a fascinating premise
and doesn't do as much with it as it could, but in the end, the mere fact
that anyone even tried this in the first place was enough to make me like
the film. The subject of the afterlife and what happens if two soul-mates
don't go to the same place has undeniable emotional and spiritual power,
and frankly it deserves a better treatment than that given it by director
Vincent Ward and writer Ron Bass. Still, I'm glad someone even let them put
this on the screen in the first place.
The screenplay introduces us to a happy, loving family of four--Chris
(Robin Williams), his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), and their two
children--and then quickly proceeds to kill three of them (Chris and the
two children) in car accidents. Chris finds himself in heaven, which
initially, in one of the many wondrous visual sights in this film, appears
in the form of one of Annie's impressionist paintings. He is still able to
connect with what Annie is experiencing back on earth because, as his
longtime deceased friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) tells him, he and Annie
are a rarity: true soul-mates. This is a decent explanation for why Chris
and Annie are so hopelessly devoted to each other, but it's also an excuse
not to spend much time on character development. Since all the main
characters except Annie are killed within the first ten minutes of the
film, we never actually see the wonderful life that they once shared, and
the emotional connection between characters and audience isn't what it
needs to be for this sort of material. We believe it's there because the
film literally tells us so, but we don't feel it to the extent that we
should.
While Chris acclimates himself to the joys of heaven, Annie labors under
severe depression, feeling she has nothing left to live for. One of the
film's successes is the juxtaposition of the magnificent displays of
paradise and the earth-bound gloom of Annie's lonely existence: the shift
in tone between the two is noticeable and effective. In any case, Annie
eventually decides to take her own life. Unfortunately, that means she
can't pass to heaven and be re-united with Chris, and here the screenplay
conjures up an inventive reason for why this is her fate that doesn't rely
too heavily on the outdated "all suicides go to hell" theology. Chris, of
course, won't accept this, and becomes determined, with the reluctant help
of a few friends and of his children, to journey literally through hell and
back to find Annie and save her from her self-defeating gloom.
The problem, however, is that Ward and Bass seem much more interested in
suggesting these ideas about love, death, and the afterlife than they do in
Chris and Annie themselves. They are, of course, inventive ideas. While
they don't spend too much time with it, the afterlife they've created
operates with its own set of rules that, as far as I can tell, have not
been derived from any particular theological tradition. For example, those
in heaven seem to have an incomplete picture of the mechanics of salvation,
and while they know God is "up there somewhere shouting down His love,"
they apparently haven't actually sat down and had a cup of coffee with Him
yet. And I would be neglecting a major aspect of the film's appeal if I
didn't mention its epic, magnificent visual design of the idylls of heaven
and the gloomy dungeons of hell.
But the film is still on tenuous ground here. Any story about eternal love
and quests through heaven and hell risks degenerating into cheesy
pseudo-philosophical fluff. WHAT DREAMS MAY COME mostly avoids the obvious
pitfalls, though I could have done without all the scenes of people flying
and a bizarre attempt at black comedy in which Chris has to traverse a "sea
of faces" in Hell and accidentally steps on a few lost souls' noses ("Watch
where you're stepping!" one of them yells). The story mostly flows nicely
without too many problems; in fact, sometimes it goes to greater lengths
with the exposition than seemed necessary. It starts to get a little rocky
towards the end, however, as so many vague truisms are uttered in an
attempt to explain what's happening that one more could have sent the whole
thing into a dizzying metaphysical tailspin.
Even if you find the story trite and pointless (which I didn't), you should
still see WHAT DREAMS MAY COME if nothing else for the outstanding design
and scope of the visuals. (By the way, the Oscar committee really have
their heads in the sand if this doesn't get nominated for something in the
technical categories.) In the end, it scrapes through by the skin of its
teeth, with its imaginative qualities carrying it through the weak spots to
produce an honest but flawed drama. Still, when the greatest virtues of a
film about the afterlife are intellectual and aesthetic rather than
emotional and spiritual, it's a pretty sure sign that it wasn't all it
could have been.

Starring: Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra
Anyone who has seen the ads for Dreams knows that it is a colorful and
visually stunning picture. But what the commercials show is merely a
small portion of the many "universes" seen in the film. That world of
wet acrylic paint flowers is part of Chris' (Williams) imagination in
the afterlife. Supposedly each person has their own world. But as your
mind changes, your world changes. Chris is remakably similar to his
human self, which the film points out is a choice on his part;
something that makes it easier for him to deal with. He can be
whomever he wishes, and other people can take on different faces as
well.
Chris and his family don't deserve the tragedy that befalls them. He
and wife Annie (Sciorra) lose their children in a car crash, an event
that sends Annie off the deep end. Four years later, things seemingly
patched up, Chris too dies in a car accident. His heavenly struggle
then comences. He goes on a journey to reunite with his children and
eventually his wife.
Unless you have seen the film, all you have seen are the bright colors
of what heaven is to Chris. It is every bit as beautiful and enjoyable
as you watch it flood the movie theater screen. What you have not
seen, however, is Art Director Christian Wintter's (yes, two 't's)
version of hell. Though the characters describe hell as different for
everyone, and not truly a "hot as hell" torturous existence, it is an
awful gruesome place.
For reasons I will not disclose to you, Williams must make a journey
to the netherworld, and what a journey it is. He enters the "general
area" and sees a somber but rather attractive world. One in which
people who look as though they've been snatched from a Dickens novel
float through the air over black lakes where streets should be. But
once Chris makes a lunge for something in his imagination, he falls
straight down to the opening of the gates of hell, a truly astonishing
cinematic sight. The gates are constructed from various shipwrecks,
and tormented pale bodies swim in the waters.
Dreams begins to take on a Terry Gilliam-esque feel. In a scene the
ex-Pythoner would have LOVED to have been a part of, Chris tries to
hop safely through a field of living but decaying talking heads. Truly
something that must be seen, not described.
At one point, Dreams becomes a truly dark and uneasy film. It his
sometimes hard to watch, not so much because of violence or gross-out
stuff, but because of the dark concept. It is clear that Ward wanted
to take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster. Whether he does is
up to the individual viewer. For me, it was more like the Teacups than
a rollercoaster, but it was still back and forth, and I suppose that
is sufficient. But I will say that I left the theater feeling
satisfied with the result. It is a film that could have gone off on a
most depressing turn.
There were numerous technical glitches and some amaturish mistakes,
but they slide right off the picture, leaving us with a well-directed,
if sometimes choppy, film. Williams is not the goofy one we've come to
know and love over the years. Nor is he the deep stretch that proves
him Oscar-worthy as Awakenings and Good Will Hunting. He is the
everyday emotional fellow that he plays so well. (There are an awful
lot of tears in this movie.) The cast does a terrific job, though
Gooding Jr. seems to disappear as quickly as he came.

Philosopher physician Deepak Chopra has a story about two people who ride a
roller coaster. For the first, this is a frightening experience and it fills
his body with unhealthy adrenaline. The second loves the thrills and his body
creates healthy endorphins. "It's not the ride," he says, "it's the rider."
That we create our own realities is a concept the "New Age" -- whatever that
means -- borrowed from eastern religions and has become accepted as truth even
among the western medical community. Stress and attitude are thought to be the
leading cause of illness. How we see the world is how the world is. We control
the ride, not the other way around.
Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) can create his own realm. Literally. The only
problem is that he had to die first.
Chris and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) have the perfect marriage. Soulmates, he
is a pediatrician; she, a painter. They have two wonderful children. Then
things fall apart. The kids are killed in a tragic car wreck and full-of-life
Annie is devastated with all of her joy wrenched away. After an attempted
suicide, she is institutionalized.
Four years later Annie has recovered and is back at work. Chris stops to help
an accident victim and is killed when a car flips over onto him. When he comes
to, he is in a wondrous afterlife where anything he imagines comes true. He
can have anything he wants. Except Annie.
The death of her life partner sends Annie into a depression spiral and she
succeeds in her second suicide attempt. People who kill themselves don't go to
the same place that Chris did. He's informed that he can never see her again.
Chris refuses to accept this and begins his Orpheus-like journey into the
underworld to rescue his lover.
Before I go on, I have to tell you that this is the most visually stunning
film in recent memory. The movie is extraordinary. Far too often, special
effects cause the audience to think "That's cool. I wonder how they did it."
More successful movies evoke "That's cool" without pulling you out of the
film. "Dreams" only allows "That's" as you sit, mouth agape, in astonishment.
You are not watching the film, you _are_ the film.
Chris' heaven is based on paintings. Before he understands how it works, his
Monet surroundings not only look like paint, they _are_ paint and not quite
dry. When he picks and squeezes a brilliant blue flower, it liquefies into
pigment. As he runs down a hill stepping on bright reds and yellows, the
ground squishes beneath his feet flowing into streams of combined colors. At
first his world looks like someone went overboard with Photoshop on a Macintosh.
The heavenly city is a wonderful living Maxfield Parrish poster. Hell is a
frightening combination of H. R. Giger and German Expressionism. The hundreds
of condemned souls surrounding Chris' boat is more chilling than even the
similar scene in "Titanic". When he reaches Annie, the color palate becomes
monochromatic reflecting her state of mind. 
The team of director Vincent Ward ("The Navigator"), effects supervisors Ellen
Ward, production designer Eugenio Zanetti and cinematographer Eduardo Serra
have given us a film that visually is beyond words. I'm wearing out my
thesaurus looking up synonyms for "awesome."
Like myths of old, the story is a metaphor for life. Chris' afterlife is
brilliant and full of wonders because that is how he sees the world. Annie's
is gloomy and without hope because that's her view. The one message that I
have doubts is that it is possible to save the damned by joining them in hell.
That path leads not to salvation, but madness. 
Annie's willingness to accept responsibility for the deaths (her housekeeper
drove the children on their fatal trip because Annie was too busy, Chris was
running an errand for her) is symptomatic of the depressed. She believes that
she is so powerful that everything is her fault.
Every actor in the film is excellent. Williams exhibits none of his manic
over-the-top personality yet is intense, determined and at the same time
filled with joy. Sciorra is remarkable as Annie sinks further and further into
the depths. Before her melancholy, there is a scene on a hill near Switzerland
where, dressed in gauze, she is one of the most alluring women in cinematic history.
Chris' first heavenly guide is Albert, played likably by Cuba Gooding, Jr. In
another excellent effect, when he first appears, he is blurry, out of synch
with Chris. As he comes more into focus, he explains to Chris that "Thought is
real. Physical is the illusion. Ironic, isn't it?"
Max von Sydow is the "Tracker," Chris' guide through hell. His extreme screen
presence prepares us for the trip into the abyss. In another film he would
stand out but here there is no character that it is possible to take your eyes
off of.
Like the movie itself, the reviews for this are all over the spectrum from
people who hated it to those who were amazed. Aside from obvious technical
aspects, movie-going is often a subjective experience. What one person finds
trite, another may experience as profound. What you bring into the theater is
an important part of what you take out.
I suppose that I was ready for this film. There are problems: the final scene
is a bit corny, some of the truisms are simplistic. But I didn't care. It blew
me away.
After leaving the movie, I was in no shape to drive home. Walking over to the
edge of the parking lot and gazing into the moonlit forest across the street,
I lighted a cigarette and wondered why so often we chose to live in the gray
world of hell when there is so much Maxfield Parrish out there.

Fresh off of his Oscar winning performance as Best Supporting Actor in
1997's 'Good Will Hunting', Robin Williams is to be commended for his
efforts in continuing to find good dramatic roles.  In fact, teaming up
with 1996's Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor in 'Jerry Maguire',
Cuba Gooding Jr., the two of them make an interesting pair on screen, if
only they weren't in such a hauntingly unpleasant film as 'What Dreams
May Come'.  Don't get me wrong.  Unpleasant films can make for good
entertainment if mixed with some elements of film making redemption
contained within the story but this film has about 90% of its running
time locked in the ultimate nightmare about the balance between Heaven
and Hell and then it pays off mildly at the end but I'm ruining nothing
because I won't tell you exactly how except to say otherwise that the
film suffers from over length and has a visual style that is comparable
to a tour of droll and unattractive art.  The acting in this film is,
however, simply superb from all involved.
Williams plays a doctor with two children and a wife (Annabella
Sciorra).  The couple are more than husband and wife as we discover in
the film, they are actually soul mates.  The children die in a dreaded
traffic accident and few years later, after stepping out of his vehicle
to help victims of another traffic accident, Williams is killed by an
oncoming vehicle.  He goes directly to Heaven where he is greeted by
Gooding who is the angel of explanation and a comfort in welcoming
Williams to his new and presumably eternal home.  But there's one
problem.  After being in Heaven for a while, Williams discovers that his
wife committed suicide and went to Hell.  Refusing to accept her fate,
Williams learns that he can go to the farthest depths of the black abyss
to bring her back.
Max Von Sydow plays The Tracker, a figure who takes Williams on his tour
of Hell in search of his wife.  Seeing Von Sydow in this film brings up
memories of 'The Exorcist' as this is another look at the elements of
Hell, striking terror into the hearts of people bound for that terrible
place.
Director Vincent Ward has made a film that is too offbeat to be seen
again and again by mainstream audiences.  Once is more than enough for
this film and the biggest problem the film encounters is that the
screenplay by Ron Bass based on the novel by Richard Matheson, tries too
hard to explain its message of the next world and eventually it over
emphasizes the bearings that make you eligible for your eternal destiny,
no matter what it is.  Vincent Ward's vision of both Heaven and Hell are
convincing but the film's explanation of what makes a person bound for
one place or the other is also confusing and it tries to cover all the
bases in what people have discussed in written theology over the years
or discussed with each other on talk shows, religious programs or even
around the water cooler at work about just WHAT EXACTLY Heaven and Hell
are.
The most exhilarating look at the after life and its qualities designed
to make you feel good are 1978's 'Heaven Can Wait', 'Always' (1989) and
'Ghost' (1990).  These films are a pleasure to watch over and over again
with a richly textured message that makes you feel positive about the
after life, if there is one.  Their entertainment value is simple and
these three films, unlike 'What Dreams May Come', have almost no
religious over tones to think about.

If you've always been curious about exactly what heaven and hell look
like, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME offers some intriguing suggestions. In
director Vincent Ward's long cinematic sermon on the advantages of a
moral life, the movie depicts heaven as a happy, colorful landscape
painting and hell as an eerie, gray, Holocaust graveyard overflowing
with talking heads.
The rarely subtle film shows two dead children from inside their coffins
during the opening credits. They have died in a car accident, and their
father will shortly die in another, leaving their mother to grieve for
them all back on earth. Although four years elapse between the two car
accidents, the movie dispenses with them quickly so that it can get to
the heavenly beyond.
The father, Chris Nielsen, is a doctor played by Robin Williams.
Annabella Sciorra plays his wife and "soul mate," an artist named Annie.
Both are deeply scarred characters who share their troubles with us in
almost every scene. If the movie were involving, it could have been the
downer of the year. Instead, it stays at the level of visual technical
achievements with the figures in it about as real as those in art
gallery paintings -- lovely to look at, but nothing to get concerned
over.
Cuba Gooding, Jr., first seen only as a blur, plays Albert, Chris's
guide into heaven. Gooding, like the rest of the fine actors, is largely
wasted in a movie that works only at an ethereal level. The magical film
is artistically surreal but only sporadically realistic.
The script by Ronald Bass, based on Richard Matheson's novel, could have
used a little more levity and should have given the characters some
credible depth. "I screwed up," Chris says when he sees his dog in
heaven. "I'm in dog heaven." This delightfully natural humor is
regretfully absent in most of the movie.
The story's pop messages include such trite ones as, "Good people end up
in hell because they can't forgive themselves." (Okay now, let's all
forgive ourselves so we will get to pass through the pearly gates
successfully. Whew, that's a collective load off our shoulders.)
Once in heaven, Chris is amazed to find that he has walked into one of
his wife's paintings. The film shows us a heaven that is a blend of  the
nineteenth-century landscape paintings of Turner and Cole mixed with
impressionistic touches. Not only is it gorgeous, the paint isn't even
dry yet. As though in a heavenly version of WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE
FACTORY, Chris gets to sample the paintings by running through them and
squeezing the flowers in his palms as the paint squirts out. These
dazzling images are among the loveliest and most innovative Hollywood
has created in years. With Michael Kamen's dramatic music and Yvonne
Blake's sumptuous costumes for the afterlife, the film works best when
viewed as grand opera as illustrator Maxfield Parrish might have staged
it.
In the tradition of life-after-death pictures, Chris goes back in an
attempt to console his wife on earth. Rather than giving her peace,
these unseen visits increase her depression. Eventually she will die
too, but, through a kind of legal snafu, she ends up in hell. Moral
rules, it seems, are filled with fine print. The body of the movie has
Max von Sydow, as a mysterious character called The Tracker, leading
Chris on a journey into hell to help Chris find his beloved Annie.
A movie filled with absolutely stunning imagery, it is strangely cold
and unengaging despite all its beauty. Still, the pedantic script's
tedium is more than offset by the handsomeness of the production. WHAT
DREAMS MAY COME is a feast for the eyes even if not a particularly
filling meal for the mind.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME runs 1:48. It is rated PG-13 for thematic elements
involving death, some disturbing images, profanity including the F-word
and brief nudity. The film would be fine for teenagers.

Cast: Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra, Max Von
Sydow, Jessica Brooks Grant, Josh Paddock.
Screenplay: Ron Bass, based on the novel by Richard Matheson. Producers:
Stephen Simon and Barnet Bain.
Director: Vincent Ward.
In a literally picturesque view of the afterlife, we are faced with
prospects of living out the rest of eternity in a universe carrying our
most fond and cherished memories of the living  that's providing you
didn't commit suicide  suicides, end up in hell. This movie suggests
these premises, and you can also choose to be reborn if so wished. All
rather wishful thinking, but who knows?
This sets the scene for one man after death, in search of his family and
wife. It is the search of one man in heaven, journeying into another
woman's hell. Whether you believe true love can rescue another soul from
eternal damnation, is up for debate, but it's the struggle and
determination of a man in love, which is of import. Will he succeed, or
will he be forever damned with her?
The cinematography is undoubtedly one of the ingenious pieces of art
that has been splashed onto screen. Much of this movie throbs with the
life of a living painting. It will push the viewer's imagination to new
dimensions, adding colour to the mundanity of movie re-making. This
alone is one good reason for watching this movie - it is fresh and
original. However, for those who have strong convictions about the after
life, this movie may disturb your sensibilities, with its mixture of New
Age thinking and eastern philosophies.
Robin Williams, is sensitive as the role of the man in search of his
wife after death, but because of the nature of the work, hardly gets to
crack a joke side ways. I'm not entirely convinced that Annabella
Sciorra was ideal person for the role of the lost wife, but it really
doesn't matter when it comes down to life and death.

WHAT DREAMS MAY COME (director: Vincent Ward; screenwriter: Ron
Bass/based on the novel by Richard Matheson; cinematographer: Eduardo
Serra; cast: Robin Williams (Chris Nielsen), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Albert),
Annabella Sciorra (Annie Nielsen), Max von Sydow (the Tracker), Jessica
Brooks Grant (Marie Nielsen), Josh Paddock (Ian Nielsen), Werner Herzog
(Face in hell), 1998)
A metaphysical love fantasy film by the New Zealand director Vincent
Ward (The Navigator/Map of the Human Heart). The most important question
this film seems to ask, Is how could one take Robin Williams seriously?
Answer: You can't! It's strictly a film overloaded with cornball and
tripe scenes; a film that starts out with breathtaking visuals, with the
possibility that we are moving into the special territory of the
imagination, but it soon turns into a conventional Hollywood tearjerker.
It does this without the benefit of good acting, a meaningful story, or
pertinent dialogue- all that's diverting is some hokum about heaven and
hell, plus some beautiful photography of paintings ranging from Caspar
David Friedrich to Renoir to Salvador Dali. The film, to its most
assured benefit, was magnificently shot in the splendor of Montana's
Glacial Forest, giving it a tremendous visual appeal.
It was shot from a religious non-denominational basis, but does a
disservice to all religions by being inaccurate about what it sells for
religious belief. It explores no deep metaphysical themes, develops no
characters, asks no real hard questions, it only seems to be made for
materialists, those who are so enamored by the 'New Age' of materialism,
that this film holds out hope for them that they can live forever and
reunite with their loved ones in heaven.
God's name comes up once. Robin Williams asks his guide Albert (Cuba
Gooding) when he is dead: "Where is God?" Cuba answers: "He's up there
somewhere." You can see for yourself how heavy the dialogue is. But, at
least, it did clear up where God was.
The mushy plot is about a perfect couple, Dr. Chris Nielsen (Robin) and
Ann (Annabella). She's an artist and an art restorer, who works for a
museum. They meet when their boats collide on a Swiss lake, and it was
love at first sight for these soul mates. They are happily married with
a boy and a girl, but tragedy hits when their kids die in an auto crash.
She feels guilty that she wasn't driving and has a breakdown, even
seeing a "shrink." But, through Chris' total devotion to her, she has
fully recovered.
Four years later Chris is on a rainy highway when a car crashes into the
pediatrician while he is trying to help some others in a car crash. His
wife is despondent that she lost all her loved ones in auto accidents,
so she commits suicide.
What the film tries to do is imagine the unknown. When Chris first
arrives in heaven, he finds himself inside one of Annie's romantic
paintings. After making his way in a gorgeous flower bed, he finds
himself covered with paint, as though he had landed on a piece of art
that still hadn't dried. Cuba Gooding is his angel guide. He gives us
the real deal as to what is going on in heaven, like telling us "Thought
is Real." "The Physical is the Illusion." He also lets us know, that
Heaven, means becoming who you want to be. I could have done without his
expertise in these matters. I could have also done without him in the
film; he was about as miscast as Robin Williams was.
Since Chris' wife is a suicide, she is assigned to hell. The Tracker
(Max von Sydow) tells us, "Hell is for those who don't know they're
dead.'' To get there and take Annie back with him to heaven, Chris
enlists the Tracker's help. Hell is seen as an eternal sea of doomed
human heads, twisted metal objects, and gloomy brownish colors.
The chatter about the afterworld is nonsensical psychological babble.
The story is played with such misplaced conviction, that this
emotionless story was not only devoid of reason and intellectual acuity,
but was an embarrassment in every other possible way. For a film that
was so stylishly lush to look at, it had little else to offer. I sort of
liked Ann's line when in hell: "Sometimes you lose when you win." I
think you'll probably lose when you see this clinker. I wasted some
precious earth time viewing what passes for the film's banal concepts of
heaven and hell. There was just nothing real about this film, or
anything to learn from it, or anything I felt about it, except
irritated.

The title comes from Hamlet 's "To be, or not to be": "To die- to sleep
--To sleep! perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub--For in that sleep of
death what dreams may come--When we have shuffled off this mortal
coil--Must give us pause..."
But do not look for Shakesperean parallels in this sentimental, kitschy,
would-be tear-jerker fantasy whose sole reason for being is its display of
computerized special effects.
The film's preliminaries, made to coincide with the opening credits, have
Chris (Williams) and Annie (Sciorra) meet cute on a lake bordering
Switzerland, re-meet cute on land, do kiss-kiss (but no bang-bang), marry
cute. Later their two cute teen-age kids die in a car crash. Cut to four
years as we see Chris practicing pediatrics while being oh-so-warm and cute
with a young patient and looking at the little girl's X-rays AND at slides
of Annie's paintings. The sugar content keeps rising. Then Chris dies in a
freak crash inside a tunnel.
He reappears in the hereafter which is a color riot of living (sic)
elements (such as water he can Biblically walk on), of  profuse vegetation,
flowers, etc. --all seemingly inspired by Annie's artwork. The sights, made
with advanced digital computer techniques, are impressive as gimmicks but
don't get you anywhere. They look like combinations of paintings by French
Impressionists gone berserk with acrylics and loading their canvases to the
max, some unmistakable bits of Van Gogh swirling brushwork, and often
heavily romantic 19th century German oils by Caspar David Friedrich and
fanciful, massive scenes of the American West by Albert Bierstadt. The orgy
of colors and special effects becomes oppressive and may give you visual
overload with its lushness.
With hops, skips and jumps, more views appear, from flying, Peter Pan-ish
people to graphics that mix the Book of Hours of the Duke of Berry with
Byzantine icons.
Chris is, of course, in Paradise--though not in Heaven, since he learns
that Annie, in her despair at her husband's demise, has committed suicide.
An angel (though not identified as such) is Chris counselor-guide. His name
is Albert (as in Bierstadt).  He spouts cliches of sagacity, like "Thought
is real. Physical [sic] is the illusion."
Chris, an Orpheus for our times, searches for Annie-Eurydice, even though
there's no place in Heaven for the dead by suicide. Are you listening Dr.
Kevorkian?  "They go somewhere else" dixit Albert, who explains that Annie
"has violated the moral order." The somewhere else is in the nether regions
which Chris reaches via the Tracker -- the Virgil to Chris's Dante. The
Tracker is Max von Sydow, wasted here, especially if your remember him from
Ingmar Bergman movies.
The tour of the Underworld takes us to sundry dark locations. In one,
flames are combined with Sisyphus-like beings who go up and down
excavations akin to those of the much more powerful  Hell on Earth images
of  Brazilian gold-mines workers in the documentary Powaqqatsi (1988). Yet
another of Albert's profundities goes:  "Hell is not fire and pain. The
real hell is your life gone wrong." In this murkiness of sights and
concepts, Chris also has to step by an immensity of human heads projecting
from the ground -- a not-so-oblique derivation of Cambodia's Killing
Fields.
Throughout, Robin Williams maintains forced expressions of smiles,
beatitude or sorrow-- all forced, unconvincingly stiff and theatrical, all
making you miss Williams the kinetic, wild clown. Annabella Sciorra
delivers her lines flatly.
"What Dreams..." is the first American feature by director Vincent Ward, a
talented New Zealander who had previously made Vigil,  Navigator: A
Mediaeval Odyssey, and Map of the Human Heart. He also wrote the story for
Alien 3.  Ward is very oriented toward imaginative visuals and ambitiously
original stories, but I find his work frustrating, with a reach exceeding
his grasp. Here, his movie is not so much frustrating as it is plain dull,
what with too many poses and visual overkill,. The determination to be
super-poetic makes it repetitive and pedestrian.
The film is, in fact, a very expensive production in two LSD genres. LSD
One is the look of the picture, like visions and hallucinations under the
influence. LSD Two is the very general subject Love is Stronger than Death,
which has been around for decades in sundry movies about reincarnation,
ghosts, etc.
I might suggest renting far more satisfactory titles. A sampling: Death
Takes a Holiday, A Guy Named Joe (remade by Spielberg as Always); Stairway
to Heaven (aka A Matter of Life and Death); Heaven Can Wait (by Ernst
Lubitsch); Here Comes Mr. Jordan (remade as Heaven Can Wait though not a
remake of the Lubitsch picture); and above all the delicious The Ghost and
Mrs. Muir.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, a sort of post-mortem romantic fantasy-drama,
shows us a world which is unlike any we've seen before on screen.  Oh
sure, plenty of films have ventured into the realms of the afterlife, from
the sublime (DEFENDING YOUR LIFE) to the ridiculous (JACOB'S LADDER).
This, however, is a heaven of a different, considerably gaudier color.
It's the heaven created by Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a pediatrician
who dies in an auto accident.  Torn from his wife and soul-mate Annie
(Annabella Sciorra), Chris finds the transition easier when his personal
Paradise, complete with the family dog, resembles one of Annie's oil
paintings -- bright, shimmering and fairly sticky, since it is actually
composed of oil paint.
     Those scenes in Chris's heaven-of-his-own-making highlight WHAT
DREAMS MAY COME at its finest, creating spectacularly imaginative visions
of the Next World.  Production designer Eugenio Zanetti (Academy Award
winner for RESTORATION), in conjunction with the special effects team,
conjures up impressionist landscapes, a golden city on a hill, and visions
of eternal torment which are genuinely transporting.  Unfortunately, those
same scenes also highlight the film's most glaring weakness.  As Chris
explores the new world of his afterlife, he is instructed first by his
one-time medical mentor Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) then by a mysterious
Tracker (Max Von Sydow) in various rules and regulations.  They explain
what Chris can do, and why, what he can't do, and why, how he might want
to proceed on his journey of discovery, and why.  And WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
grinds...to...a...halt.
     It's an inevitable part of metaphysical fantasies like this that
someone has to bring the audience up to speed on exactly what they're
seeing and why.  That doesn't make it any less tedious, especially when
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME isn't supposed to be about what makes particular
cosmic gears turn the way they do.  Based on a novel by science
fiction/fantasy legend Richard Matheson, it's a story of intense human
emotions, and the desire of one soul to make right in death what went
wrong in life.  The scenes of Chris's earthly life with his family, strewn
throughout the film in a near-subliminal series of flashbacks, form a
potent back-story of a life which isn't as suburban-ideal as it first
appears.  There's something compelling about the suggetion that love
doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful.
     Those emotions should have carried WHAT DREAMS MAY COME to a
transcendent level, if not for those nagging distractions.  It's not just
the constant exposition which causes the problems, either.  An even bigger
distraction is Robin Williams, whose performance can't quite capture the
aching love he's supposed to be feeling.  Williams is certainly a fine
performer, but there are times when he's giving a "serious" performance
that he looks like he's trying way too hard.  The furrows in his brow, the
perpetually fidgeting lip and the over-dramatized line readings turn too
many interpersonal moments into exercises in How Not to Act on the Big
Screen.  Annabella Sciorra's convincing anguish could have grounded the
story in heart-breaking reality if Williams hadn't kept pulling it into
melodrama.
     Eventually, reality gives way entirely to a re-telling of the Orpheus
myth, with Chris searching for Annie's doomed soul on a journey through
the Other Place.  Again, the marvelous look of the film draws you in, as
Annie's shattered mindscape takes the form of the Nielsens' home turned a
desolate grey.  And again, a viewer is pulled away from the look of the
film by tortuous exposition and emotional confrontations which only feel
genuine on one side.  WHAT DREAMS MAY COME will likely wring tears from
those entranced by the GHOST-like prospect of romance beyond the pale.
For others, it will seem like a missed opportunity.  If a tale of primal
fears and primal emotions can't grab you without a nattering narrator,
something's very wrong.

I've seen films that deal with death and afterlife, but I don't think
I've seen any that conquer the subject with such unrelenting
determination as Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come.  It's so
refreshing to see a Hollywood production that succeeds by ignoring all
the standard conventions and cliches of the genre.  This film is
profound and deeply interesting -- it handles disturbing subjects with
unflinching sincerity.  And though it has its roots in many other works
-- from Dante's Inferno all the way up to the films of Bergman -- it
still manages originality and uniqueness.
But these aren't the elements that will stick with you, for What Dreams
May Come is one of the most visually astounding films I've ever seen. 
It's a wealth of truly beautiful sets and special effects, seamless and
visionary images of things that can't exist in our world.  That's what
makes this such a memorable film experience -- it takes you places you
have never been, and shows you things you can't see anywhere else.  In a
time when most films don't exhibit the even lowest degree of creativity,
here is a film that registers as art and serves its purpose both in
sensation and perception.  Your eyes and your mind will feed on all that
Ward's film has to offer.  
At the same time, however, the film's flaws are almost as obvious as
its virtues.  It suffers from a terribly disjointed narrative -- the
chronology is difficult to understand, and there's not always a strong
sense of momentum.  As a whole, the film may not have you feeling
absorbed as much as you may feel trapped -- at times, it's so visually
arresting that it seems like you're living the nightmare.  This is a
positive attribute to a point, but this film comes inches away from
being intolerably depressing.  I'll elaborate on all this later.
The film stars Robin Williams as Chris Neilsen, a doctor who, at the
beginning of the film, meets his true love, Annie (Annabella Sciorra). 
They get married and have two children, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie
(Jessica Brooks).  The family is shattered one day when the kids are
killed in a car accident.  The film then jumps ahead four years, when
Chris, too, is killed in another car accident, leaving Annie without
anyone in her life.
Chris suddenly finds himself watching over Annie as she grieves for
him.  His status is explained to him by a guide named Albert (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.).  Soon, Chris allows himself to proceed into Heaven, where
his world is created with the paint that his wife used to paint the
pictures he loved when he was alive.  Soon, however, it turns out
Annie's soul is in trouble, and Chris must journey through the afterlife
to find and save her.
I've left a lot out, and that's because there are many subplots, and
many flashbacks that show small portions of Chris' and Annie's life
before and after their kids get killed.  Because it deals with such
morose themes, What Dreams May Come is inescapably dark, even in the
bright and wonderfully colorful world that Chris first creates for
himself.  There's always an underlying sense of malaise and frustration,
an element that makes us feel like nothing is ever right, even when the
characters seem at least momentarily placated.  
The biggest problem with the film, however, is the lack of fluency in
the narrative.  This isn't Ward's fault -- in fact, it's hard to say if
there is any one person at fault.  The way the film is constructed lends
itself to this kind of storytelling technique -- flashbacks and the like
-- and, since it explains a world with which none of us are familiar,
it's necessary for Chris to have a guide to explain him everything
(Dante had Virgil, didn't he?).  I don't mind that this explanation is
necessary, but the first forty-five minutes of the film are spent
watching Chris reject his placement in Heaven.  Then, all the way up
until the end, the film exists on two timelines -- one in the present
tense, showing Chris on his journey, and the other showing Chris and his
family when they were alive.  The result is a story that never quite
convinces us that it's actually happening -- the whole thing feels too
much like a wicked nightmare.
And, if you stop and think about it, it's all pretty absurd.  Ron Bass'
script isn't bad; the characterizations are solid, and the themes are
well-established.  But, on a technical level, it seems a bit sloppy:  I
could poke holes through its logic all day, although I'm not sure where
that would get me.  In addition, the film isn't as moving as I was
expecting; I cared about the characters and their respective fates, but
none of the dramatic elements in the film really took hold of me the way
I was hoping they would.
Okay, so it has some big problems.  Overall, though, What Dreams May
Come is a satisfying picture, even if it misses a few opportunities for
sound logic and effective drama.  Vincent Ward is a truly gifted artist,
and this film is proof of my statement:  there are moments in What
Dreams May Come that are literally breathtaking, moments that are so
visually immersive that you won't even be able to blink, let alone look
away from the screen.  There are little things that Ward repeatedly uses
that add depth to the scenery -- lots of running water and reflections,
concrete stairways, walls that stretch up to seemingly infinite
heights.  It's the kind of imaginative world that we so rarely get to
see in films.
The acting is superb; Williams, who is often a difficult man for me to
watch, is wonderful here (although a bit heavy on the pathos).  Gooding,
Jr. is a demanding screen presence, and is very good in the role of the
Explainer.  Max von Sydow, who plays another guide whom Chris meets
halfway into his journey, is perfect for his role.  Most interesting,
however, is Annabella Sciorra, who delivers her best performance (and,
hopefully, her breakthrough role) as Annie.  Sciorra's work is complex
and shaded both emotionally and physically; she spends a lot of the film
crying, but she manages to make what could have been a token part into a
real character.
As flawed as it is, I have to recommend What Dreams May Come
enthusiastically, simply because it really is an effective film.  True,
it could have been much better, and maybe it goes a bit overboard in its
attempts to make us feel bad for the characters, but I can't think of a
film in recent history that is more visually amazing.  Vincent Ward has
created a film so beautifully original that I doubt it could be ignored
or forgotten by anyone who sees it.  It's also a film that latches to
its themes and pursuits with admirable dignity and persistence, and at
least partially succeeds.  Nowadays, it's nice to see anything that
qualifies as art, but something done with as much conviction as this is
a film to be cherished, in spite of its flaws.
