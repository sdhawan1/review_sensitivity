Four years after Tom Cruise toplined Brian De Palma's "Mission: Impossible," 
a $400-million worldwide box-office hit that, nonetheless, left audiences 
scratching their heads over the nearly incomprehensibly intricate story, 
comes "Mission: Impossible 2," from acclaimed action filmmaker John Woo. 
While De Palma has a more old-fashioned, sophisticated helming style, Woo is 
more modern and energized, carrying his go-for-broke attitude over into this 
exciting first sequel. 
Following an attention-grabbing prologue set upon an ill-fated airplane, and 
then switching to international spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on a 
rock-climbing vacation until he is given his latest mission, the picture 
wastes little time in setting up its plot. It seems an old comrade-gone-bad 
of Ethan's, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), is out to steal a bio-engineered 
virus in Sydney, Australia that has the power to wipe out the whole country, 
if not the world. Seeking the help of spunkily alluring and sexy thief Nyah 
Hall (Thandie Newton), she eventually accepts after being saved from a 
near-disastrous car accident, and falling into bed with Ethan. Conveniently 
an old flame of Sean's, Nyah is injected in her ankle with a locating device 
that tracks where she is at all times, and must travel to his headquarters 
and "rekindle" a relationship with him, all the while attempting to uncover 
Sean's entire dastardly plan. The problem is, Ethan has promised Nyah that 
she will be safe, and with himself beginning to care so much for her at the 
moment when she is knee-deep in potential danger, this mission is especially 
vital to Ethan.
A rare sequel that improves notably from its predecessor, "Mission: 
Impossible 2" is a rousing, wondrously filmed and edited action-romance 
(reminiscent in many ways of 1999's "Entrapment," starring Sean Connery and 
Catherine Zeta-Jones) that works well in both said genres. From the startling 
opener aboard the plane, to the surprisingly sexy car chase in which the cars 
being driven by Ethan and Nyah do a sort of lyrical dance together, to the 
nerve-racking motorcycle/beach battle that everything leads up to in the 
finale, director John Woo (previously a Hong Kong filmmaker) knows perhaps 
better than anyone else how to successfully set up an invigorating, 
edge-of-your-seat action setpiece. While constantly far-fetched, Woo's films 
are created primarily for their ability to entertain, which this one does, 
some of the time.
When Woo isn't pulling off an extravagant stunt and the camera has stopped 
moving, he still knows how to film pretty pictures (and pretty people), but 
the exposition scenes do occasionally drag, particularly in the half-hour 
before the sparkling 30-minute climax (so, on estimation, the problems mostly 
spring from the uninteresting 70-100 minute mark). Although "Mission: 
Impossible 2" attempts to be nothing more than a fun summer action movie, 
another setback is that, when all is said and done, it has style to spare and 
not enough character substance. Little is ever discovered about Ethan, Nyah, 
or Sean (or Ethan and Sean's previous kinship), and so they remain merely 
figures in a big, flashy movie. 
Thankfully, the one element that does have more heart than expected in a film 
of this genre is the warm romance that evolves between Ethan and Nyah. 
Ethan's fling in the original with Emmanuelle Beart was nothing more than a 
fleeting afterthought, whereas the romantic relationship here is full of 
compassion and eroticism. It would be overtly obvious to have Nyah turn out 
to be a femme fatale, and it is much more effective that she remain who she 
says she is throughout, and even grows feelings for another, something she 
wasn't sure she could do. As played by British beauty Thandie Newton (1998's 
"Beloved"), Nyah is the most memorable character, and Newton gives her an 
added dimension that otherwise might not have appeared, judging from the 
slight screenplay, by Robert Towne. Newton not only holds the screen, but she 
single-handedly grabs it away from everyone else when she is present.
After four years in which Tom Cruise released the likes of the big-budget art 
film "Eyes Wide Shut," and the unconventional, Oscar-nominated "Magnolia," he 
has once again returned to mainstream Hollywood, and proves that he still 
hasn't lost that special touch that has made him such a box-office draw all 
these years. Mostly known for his dramatic roles and romances, Cruise has 
shown with his blossoming "Mission: Impossible" franchise that he is a bona 
fide action star, one of the best there currently is. If that wasn't enough, 
performing his own stunts here, Cruise contributes some amazing physical 
work, including extreme motorcycle riding and mountain climbing (with no net 
below to catch him).
Best of all about "Mission: Impossible 2" is that its story is actually easy 
to follow, and therefore what happens means more to the viewer. In adapting a 
second film in a big screen series based on a 1966 television drama, Woo has 
neither borrowed nor paid tribute to De Palma's previous working, and, 
instead, has made his own individual vision of what the series should be 
like. And while De Palma is an undeniable major talent (particularly in his 
early work, such as "Carrie," "Blow Out," and "Dressed to Kill"), Woo more 
fittingly connects to the genre, and with "Mission: Impossible 2," he has 
made one of the most electrifying action yarns since 1994's "Speed." It may 
not be a masterpiece, but it sure does pack a wallop.

The DVD format is perfect for a film like "Mission: Impossible 2."
Through the wonders of DVD, you can savor the thrilling opening scenes,
hop, skip and jump through the sluggish center section, then enjoy the
walloping non-stop action of the last 40 minutes or so of the feature.
Just for the hell of it, you could even use the fast forward button to
boost the various slow motion shots back to normal speed (which would
likely make the film a good 10 minutes shorter). Of course, "M: I-2"
won't be available on DVD for six to eight months, so, in the meantime,
viewers will just have to suffer through the dull stuff in exchange for
the juicy moments. It's a fair trade.
"Mission: Impossible 2" marks the much anticipated meeting of legendary
action Director John Woo ("Face/Off", "Broken Arrow"), Tom Cruise and
the "M:I" franchise. Woo hurls every one of his trademarks into the
fray: martial arts, gorgeous slo-mo, birds taking flight, billowing
clothing, swirling camerawork and operatic violence, all set to a
thunderous score. In fact, Woo even winks at the audience this time
around: During one particularly tense scene, he positions sitting birds
around darkened hallways, making us wonder when they will take
Woo-flight and reveal our furtive hero's presence to the bad guys.
Where the first "Mission: Impossible" suffered from an overcomplicated
plot, matters are more straightforward this time around. Impossible
Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) finds his vacation interrupted
by a crisis of potentially global proportion. Renegade agent Sean
Ambrose (Dougray Scott) is out to steal a horrific Ebola-like virus
called Chimera, developed by an evil pharmaceutical company so they can
cash in on the antidote. To aide in his quest, Hunt recruits super thief
Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's former honey-bunny. Needless to
say, Hunt and Hall become an item almost immediately. With veteran
computer expert Luther Stikell (Ving Rhames, the only actor besides
Cruise to return from the first film) providing backup, the chase is on.
The film opens in high style, with a confrontation above the clouds that
guarantees that "M: I-2" will never be shown as an airline movie. Cut to
Ethan Hunt on holiday, climbing a beautiful, harrowing red rock face
thousands of feet above the earth (Cruise insisted on doing his own
stunt work for the scene and the result is unusually exhilarating).
After Hunt receives his mission instructions (delivered by Anthony
Hopkins in an uncredited cameo), Woo jumps to the titles, then to stars,
then to Spain for the next sequence, which introduces Thandie Newton.
It's a great beginning, followed, unfortunately, by a long draggy
stretch. Aside from a playful car chase, not much happens for far too
many minutes.
Beyond the laborious plot mechanics, there are relationship problems.
While Cruise and Newton make a fine couple, Ethan Hunt and Nyah Hall
bond too quickly to create a sense of emotional weight. The instant
intimacy between the pair hurts the later proceedings; each of them is
willing to make enormous sacrifices for the other, but it doesn't quite
feel credible. To a lesser degree, Hunt and Ambrose suffer from the same
trouble. We see a fury between them that goes beyond the simple good
guy-bad guy dynamic, but the source of the intense personal animosity is
not explained. A little more information would have helped enormously.
Instead, we get seething looks and a dull mid-section, with the
wonderful Ving Rhames relegated to the background to keep the lead hero,
the lead heroine and the lead villain squarely in the spotlight. Despite
the rubber masks and messages that will self-destruct in five seconds,
this film is more 007 than Impossible Missions Force, with Tom Cruise as
the Bond du jour. While Cruise is more than up to the task, I missed the
teamwork that made the TV series (does anyone even remember the TV
series at this point?) so much fun.
For the last 40 minutes of "M: I-2," John Woo pulls out all the stops
and delivers the kind of action that should have been spaced throughout
the entire film. The man remains a master of style, as evidenced by the
flames reflected in Ambrose's eyes, a single bird flying through a fiery
door and a phenomenal motorcycle duel. Woo needs to be careful  if he
continues repeating stock flourishes, he risks self-parody  but for
this film, they still pay off. "Mission: Impossible 2" lacks emotional
punch and the center section sorely tried my patience, but the film
remains a hell of a ride.

"Well this is not Mission: Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission:
Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you." 
  ---Agent Swanbeck (Sir Anthony Hopkins), the series' new Agent Phelps,
takes Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) down a notch. 
A Russian scientist (Rade Serbedzija) has created a new virus (and its
antidote) called Chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of
injection.  A rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), wants to
use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into
selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company (he knows it
will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the
virus he is going to cause).  Posing as Ethan Hunt, Ambrose gains the
confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure, not
realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to
prevent exactly what Ambrose was trying to do.  
The real Ethan Hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful
thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to assist the IMF team in
retrieving the stolen goods.  Ethan and Nyah fall quickly in love, but
Ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new
love has only been hired because she was a former lover of Ambrose's. 
Reluctantly, he sets up Nyah to be rescued from prison by Ambrose so she
can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team. 
Ethan must race against time to keep Ambrose from obtaining and
spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to Nyah. 
Although the first Mission:Impossible film was a moderate box office
success, audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too
confusing and there wasn't much action (although being a fan of the
series both old and new, I thought the movie was pretty decent and
especially gutsy to make Phelps a bad guy).  That problem has been
rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible (courtesy of
one of the writers of the previous entry, Robert Towne) and by turning
the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of
action film guru John Woo.  The end result is one of the most
entertaining (yet simple) action films made in a long while. 
Unfortunately, the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow,
dwelling mainly on Ethan and Nyah's quickly blossoming romance and
seeming more in place in a James Bond film than with the less glamorous
Mission:Impossible TV series.  Ethan's conflict is a compelling one, but
it seems very rushed (and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck
that Ethan himself causes!).  John Woo handles all of this with an
artistic flair that seems out of place, featuring a great deal of slow
fades and dramatically framed close-ups.  The surreal nature of these
sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film. 
Thankfully though, at the point Ambrose discovers Nyah's deception,
Mission:Impossible II becomes very entertaining and action-packed. 
Robert Towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the
first film and parodies them during a sequence where Ethan must break
into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the
virus.  After that, the action scenes just begin to build in intensity,
as is the case with many of Woo's previous high-octane films.  The final
half hour is an all out assault of action (a good deal of which is
ruined by the trailer, unfortunately).  
As far as summer entertainment goes, Mission:Impossible II is
serviceable fare.  Anyone looking for hardcore action won't be
disappointed (except for during the first half of the film, perhaps). 
Even if you weren't a fan of the first film, this entry deserves some
checking out.  [PG-13]

     The new "Mission: Impossible" film is out for early summer
audiences.  It will have stiff box office competition from Disney's
current DINOSAUR which offers material that will appeal to adults.
     Once again we have a "Mission: Impossible" movie without a
"Mission Impossible" plot.   What is a "Mission: Impossible" plot?
It is like a jigsaw puzzle.  Through most of the plot you see the
pieces being fit together, but you have no idea what they build.
Suddenly toward the end you go through an "Ah-ha!" experience when
you understand what it is all for.  Then you see what you built do
its thing.  Maybe doing its thing is to make some banana republic
would-be Hitler suddenly appear to have been stealing from the
country's treasury.  It is a spy film powered by gray cells instead
of testosterone.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 is as clueless as its
predecessor what its title claims it to be.  It is like me saying I
am going to write great romantic sonnets just like Shakespeare, but
I am going to write them in four lines.
     Instead of a "Mission: Impossible" plot it has something that
might have worked as a James Bond script.  And evens so, it would
have been a Bond script a little heavy on chases and fights.  For
too much of the screen time Cruise is just showing off for the
camera.  Cruise is trying to be the Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., of our
generation.  He wants to be dashing and handsome and superb at any
number of sports.  This film is too intent on glamorizing Cruise.
     As the story opens we have a scientist in Sydney, Australia,
who had developed a great anti-virus.  And to prove the anti-virus
works he has also developed a great deadly virus for his anti-virus
to counter.  (Yes, that's what he did.)  Now he wants to take the
virus and the anti-virus to the CDC in Atlanta so he injects himself
with the deadly virus.  The deadly strain will be benign for exactly
20 hours, then it will attack him like Ebola.  Our brilliant
scientist wants to get to Atlanta and inject himself with the anti-
virus and not become the Patient Zero of a virus that could destroy
the world.  And what does he do to be sure to get to Atlanta in
time?  He boards a commercial air flight.  (Is this making sense to
you?)  But there are baddies who will stop at nothing to get the
virus and anti-virus.  On the commercial plane the pilot happens to
be one of the baddies' gang.  (However did they manage that?  They
didn't even know what plane he would be taking.)  The baddies, led
by Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), seize the biological agents and
escape the plane, leaving it to crash.
     The Impossible Mission Force has to call in the vacationing
Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) who is having fun by climbing
about half a mile up a sheer rock face without benefit of equipment.
The IMF brings in Ethan and tells him to pick two team members as
well as recruit a third, one a beautiful jewel thief named Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  (With a name like Nordoff-Hall one
wonders if there was a bounty on her head.)  In the best traditions
of Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS, she is asked to go not just under cover
but also between the sheets with former lover Ambrose.
     The film stars Tom Cruise as the lead agent of the IMF.
Thandie Newton is a new face and a different one, but she does not
have enough to do on the screen.  Tom Cruise plays the athletic
miracle man.  In an unbilled role, Anthony Hopkins is around to give
Cruise his orders.  Tom Cruise plays the great lover secret agent.
Dougray Scott is a little lackluster for the villain, but perhaps a
lackluster villain is more realistic.  Tom Cruise is there as the
quick-thinking super-agent.  The Impossible Mission team also has
the talented Ving Rhames returning as Luther Stickell.  He gets to
ride a helicopter and shoot a gun.  Rounding out the crack team of
four agents was some dude with a thin moustache and beard.  I don't
remember if he did anything or had any speaking lines.  I seem to
remember he flew the helicopter.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 also
features Tom Cruise.
     MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 was badly in need of another script re-
write, particularly by someone who was a fan of the original series.
John Woo keeps the action coming, but not the intelligence.  And Woo
is not able to make the action scenes believable or enjoyable.  The
climactic fight is as funny as it is contrived.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
2 is more just a Tom Cruise vanity piece than anything else.  I rate
it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.
     I am starting to have a real problem with this whole mask
thing.  The idea seems borrowed from the opening of FROM RUSSIA WITH
LOVE, where it was fresh.  But let us be clear that to masquerade as
someone else with one of these masks requires a lot of preparation
ahead of time.  It cannot be easy to make a mask that would fool
someone into thinking they were seeing someone they knew when it was
really someone else.  The voice disguise would also take a
tremendous amount of preparation.  Probably neither could be done
without the cooperation of the person who is going to be
impersonated.  Further, people recognize each other by more than
scent, word-choice, accent, memories, and dozens of other
parameters.  The original series used impersonation very, very
sparingly giving the person a lot of preparation time and even then
it was really a credibility stretcher.  You do not just attack a
building with a back-pocket full of these impersonation masks ready
to use.  In addition dramatically it is a poor idea.  It distracts
the audience making them constantly wonder if they really know who
they are looking at or not.  The script uses it entirely too
frequently, whenever the writer wants to throw the audience a cheap
and easy curve ball.

"The search for a hero begins with something that every hero requires, a villain." 
- Vladimir Nekhorovich, "Mission: Impossible 2" 
This is summer, and it is time for summer movies. Time for super sized
popcorns. Time to have fun. And no summer is a summer without great
action films with terrible villains and noble heroes. That's why
Hollywood produces hundreds of clichés every year to satisfy the
infinite demands of the hungry audience. To create a refreshing and
original action film in the midst of clones, is a mission:
impossible. And it is a mission that director John Woo chooses to
accept.
In a secret laboratory scientists, searching for a miraculous cure,
have created a monstrous virus, Chimera, that is capable of infecting
the entire planet. Realizing the incredible danger of their discovery,
the project leader, Vladimir Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) sends a
cryptic message to his contact - special agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)
of IMS Secret Service, asking for protection. If Chimera would fall
into the wrong hands, the consequences would be catastrophic. Hunt's
mission is to retrieve a sample of Chimera. This mission is made
impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after
samples of this lethal disease. Among others is a former IMF agent
(Dougray Scott) who has already managed to steal the cure called
'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' in order to pressure the
governments and acquire complete economic control over the civilized
world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies
on the help of an international thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) of whom he
quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for
Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get
their hands on it, but he must also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save
his love interest who has already become infected by the disease from
a terrible and rapid death.
This is a great action film created by the master of the genre. It's
not that the script is complex and intelligent or performances
great. It is filled with most ordinary type of action sequences: gun
fights, car chases, combat scenes. But John Woo manages to transform
these ancient clichés into sheer eye candy. The action scenes that
looked dull in 'The World Is Not Enough', explode into colorful
fireworks before your eyes in this energy packed thrill ride. In fact
every element that didn't work in 'WINE' is flourishing here. This is
James Bond resurrected. This is action revitalized. Every necessary
element is carefully inserted at the right time in the right
moment. There is enough mystery and suspense for any audience member,
and as the beautiful locations are frequently changing from elegant
Madrid to beautiful Sydney, the intensity is growing. Woo directs with
such energy and elegance that no matter how silly the plot, you're
fascinated, intrigued and stunned. Cruise is a believable hero and the
best of substitutes for James Bond. He has always been a brave actor,
willing to take chances in choosing risky parts. In the latest years,
his attempts have paid off. With his several serious roles, one in
Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and another in 'Magnolia' (which earned him
an Oscar nomination), Cruise has established himself with the critics
as a serious actor, capable of virtually anything. Now, with 'M:I2',
he can become the hero of the box-office. He not only stars, but also
produces Woo's latest venture into the world of filmmaking. This is
Cruise-control at its best. A truly delightfully energetic
performance, that makes Bond look like a schoolboy. Dougray Scott is
Hunt's perfect nemesis. From the beginning of the film it is
established that he is one of the best agents that IMF has to
offer. He has even replaced Hunt on several missions, before he turned
to the 'dark side'. His frightening ease and cool ruthlessness, make
him lethal, capable of anything. Thandie Newton ('Beloved') is
likewise a nice choic e are not required, her purpose is simply
looking beautiful, which she does. Rade Sherbedgia and Anthony Hopkins
appear in small refreshing cameo roles. But it is Cruise who really
contribute more to the film than anyone else. It is a much more
explosive performance, than in De Palma's first installment. And the
film itself has changed along side with the main character. It has got
bigger muscles. Woo has transformed De Palma's quieter thriller into a
high energy, adrenaline-pumping adventure. The film is drained in
Woo's trademarks; deceiving appearances, mysterious events, and
incredibly elegant action sequences (the famous pigeon scene is a true
wonder). He has no respect for the laws of physics and in his world
the characters virtually fly in slow motion across the screen. Hans
Zimmer's techno score, Jeffrey L. Kimball's graceful cinematography
and Steven Kemper's fast paced editing are all achievements of the
highest artistic level that compensate for the almost complete lack of
interesting dialogue. But John Woo covers the plot up with so much
beauty, elegance and energy that the plot holes and logical
embarrassments explode before our eyes. The fans of the original might
complain, but for me this is a much more successful interpretation,
because it doesn't try to seem more clever than it is. It doesn't try
to be anything else but pure and delicate action film. And though it
is not the best that this summer has to offer ('Gladiator' was an
overall grander achievement), this is action on a grand
scale. Consider it mission accomplished.

"Good morning Mr. Hunt (Tom Cruise). The picture you see is a Dr.
Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Nekhorvich
was killed in a plane crash while on his way to deliver something to us.
We don't know what but it's really dangerous. IM agent Sean Ambrose
(Dougray Scott) was on the plane, too, and we haven't found the body.
We're not sure where he is, if he's screwed us, or exactly what your
mission is, other than to stop something really nasty from happening.
We're sure you'll figure it out along the way. Oh, you can only use two
agents and you must include a civilian thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie
Newton) on the team. We know we're not supposed to configure your team,
but we can discuss that when you come over and discuss the matter in
person with us (Anthony Hopkins). If you or any member of you IM team
should be caught or killed, yada yada yada. Have a nice day."
With all the baggage of the past buried and forgotten, John Woo takes up
the director's reigns, overseeing the one-man strike force that is Ethan
Hunt, leader of the Impossible Mission "team," in Mission: Impossible 2.
Woo, whose visual sense can make a boy giddy, lets loose with both
barrels and all the visual fireworks he can put on the big screen.
That's a good thing 'cuz the M:I2 script stinks. Like its big screen
predecessor this flick has very little in common with the television
series it is based upon, other than a self-destructing set of
instructions and characters pulling rubber mask disguises off their
faces. We don't compare to Source Material. Fans of the series can
figure out what's different from the paragraph above.
Then again, it's summertime, when all most of us want out of a movie is
onscreen fireworks and a reason to plunge our mitts into the
extra-large-super-sized popcorn up to our elbows. M:I2 delivers that in
spades, refusing to cut fight scenes that run on too long, resorting to
makeup gimmicks instead of developing a great story and, in short,
refusing to roll over and play dead when its story was done. It's almost
as if the writers and Woo sat down and figured out what would be really
cool to do and which really cool bits would be even cooler if shot in
slow motion, and then wrote the script around them. That means a
motorcycle duel, a half naked Cruise on a rock and the gun in the sand
bits that are in the teevee commercial, and a wee bit of "aerobatic
insanity" that reprises something in the last flick and which had the
audience happily giggling.
Absolutely giddy. Myself included. I told you.
If you're a novice to the concept, the IM is a secret force that
manipulates situations to bring about conclusions that punish the evil
guys and ensure that truth, justice and the American way win out. In
this case, it's the story of one renegade agent and his possession of an
artificially created strain of influenza that could devastate the world.
The "good" IM team -- our heroes include Ving Rhames, the only returnee
from M:I1 and John Polson as an almost utterly dispensable guy with an
Australian accent, useful since the film is set in Australia -- must
track and destroy another -- Richard Roxbury is the muscle on bad guy
Ambrose's side -- using the civilian and a small tracking device
implanted in Newton's ankle, as bait. The notion of one IM team against
another one is a good one. The problem is that one team leader knows all
about the moves of the other, and not vice versa. The bad guys also have
all the IM technology, so how they miss the tracking device is news to
me.
 No, it's not. It's scriptwriters ignoring the obvious. It's
scriptwriters ignoring what they've written earlier in the script. But,
just as in the last flick, this series is not so much about the story as
it is about Ethan Hunt, $20 million dollar action figure. That being the
case, Tom Cruise is absolute dynamite in black clothing. He makes a
great John Woo movie action toy. The action sequences, as in everything
John Woo does, are the reason to lay out hard cash to see the flick.
Bullets fly. Explosions, um, explode. Cruise does unbelievable physical
things believably and gets a love interest to boot. So the hell with
history and any requirement of logic in the script.
Buy the extra big popcorn and stick to the small soda. This sequel is
less complicated than the last one, but if you have to make a quick run,
you'll still miss something important.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mission: Impossible 2, he would have
paid...
It's a summertime, popcorn dateflick. All sweetener and no nutritional
value at all.

Starring: Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames, Richard 
Roxburgh, John Polson, Brendan Gleeson, Rade Sebedzija, Anthony Hopkins
For about twenty minutes into MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 director John Woo (THE 
KILLER, HARD BOILED, FACE OFF) appears to have made an exciting, elegant, 
charming spy thriller, kind of a post millennium James Bond adventure with a 
strapping American (read: unsophisticated) hero more willing to drop kick 
villains than out fox them. Sadly, as the picture progresses, the final 
product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up, two-hour long 
episode of MAGYUVER. And not a particularly good one at that. What went 
wrong? MI2 begins flashily enough, that initial flash leading us to believe 
that it'll soon give way to something of a plot, but it only gives way to 
more flash, then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of 
itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad 
guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of Tom Cruise's firing gun just 
so they can die really cool.
Early on, during a car chase between soon to be lovers Ethan Hunt (Tom 
Cruise) and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Woo works some of his 
trademark magic. In one hypnotic, though completely inexplicable sequence, 
the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as Cruise and his 
stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexualityâŚ 
just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance, coming ever so 
close to toppling over a neighboring cliff. Prior to this we see the famed 
trailer opener of Cruise climbing a steep mountain, sans scaffolding, then 
leaping from one jagged rock formation to another. Why? I haven't the 
foggiest. I doubt even John Woo could provide you with a logical reply. With 
MI2 Woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine, the one that 
jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity 
defying effects. It's possible that these "spies" could be adrenaline junkies 
climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off, though 
of course this is never explored. The scenes I've described are really only 
included to titillate, not to give any insight into character. God forbid. 
Woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic, but they remain 
individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of 
beer commercial-like visuals.
Still in terms of crackerjack eye candy, the opening has much to cherish. 
Cruise and Newton first meet during a vigorous Flamenco dance featuring 
several welcome Woo devices (the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized 
movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals 
discovering how attractive the other is). Between the frantic dancing, Woo 
trains his camera on Cruise and Newton as they make with some sensuous eye 
contact. The scene is a little over the top in a Bon Jovi music video circa 
1988 kind of way, yet it has style and something of soul, and Woo casts a bit 
of a spell on us. Sure it's all smoke and mirrors, but we can see that there 
happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product. Thandie and 
Cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully 
charming as the Jennifer Lopez\George Cloony trunk meeting in OUT OF SIGHT. 
They flirt and exchange obvious double entendres. Newton bats her eyes 
flirtatiously. Cruise grins a little too slyly.
The Cruise character, Ethan Hunt, has been drastically altered since the 
first film. Here Cruise plays him more as a hip, sexual dynamo than the 
square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1. He's cool and dashing, which is 
precisely the kind of role we want to see Cruise in after watching him sleep 
walk through EYES WIDE SHUT (which might just be the longest episode of RED 
SHOW DIARIES ever committed to film), and blustered his way through MAGNOLIA 
(quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's). Sadly as the 
film progresses we see less of Cruise's initial "I'm the man!" charm and more 
slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug.
MI2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act, which 
is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop. The whole 
thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle (the first gun fight in 
the film), which really should be unheard of in a John Woo film, but alas 
this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from Renny Harlin to 
Joseph Merhi (of course excepting the "symbolic" pigeons who seem to find 
their way into every John Woo picture). We've all seen guys slide across the 
floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand. It isn't done any 
differently here.
The action is pure HARD TARGET\BROKEN ARROW theatrics with nothing to propel 
it but the apparent need to see Tom Cruise drop kick face less villains while 
his hair whips stylishly in the wind. He's cool for sure but he's made to be 
as empty as the movie. The actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as 
for his chiseled looks; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at 
literally any moment, be it during a gunfight, before one or after one. When 
he's not beaming away, he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to 
look mad as hell, but Woo's editing seriously undermines the effort. He 
fetishizes Cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a NAKED 
GUN style spoof. I half expected Cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal 
that he's really Austin Powers.
In a classic Woo action moment, Ethan Hunt struts past a fiery doorway 
glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death. The 
gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which 
turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for 
Cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual (one dumb bastard 
even jumps his bike over the gun toting Cruise, basically inviting our 
handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does). The lead bad guy 
(played by the appropriately British Dougray Scott) and Cruise face off in a 
mentally deficient game of chickenâŚon motorcycles. Though instead of jumping 
off to the side at the last moment, the two grown men leap directly into the 
other giving each other a mid air bear hug, only to fly about a hundred feet 
(still in bear hug position), land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano 
fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "so you thought I was 
dead...". Not to worry, Cruise takes care of the problem without even 
breaking a sweat. What a hero!
You may have noticed that I opted not to describe an iota of MI2's plot. My 
reasoning is simple: I'm not sure of any good it would do. The film itself 
has absolutely no concern with story, only with hurtling forth to the next 
"special" effect. I wasn't kidding when I told a friend of mine that MI2 has 
less plot than the average Aerosmith video. Nobody will go to this for the 
plot, and if they do they'll surely regret it. As summer movies evolve (or 
devolve) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly 
nothing. In MI, the plot seemed to be built around Brian De Palma's (that 
film's director) stylistic flourishes, while in MI2 the plot only serves to 
give us an intermittent breather from Woo's non-stop masturbatory 
pandemonium. It's irrelevant in every sense, as is character. All that 
ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors.

It is rare when the sequel, GODFATHER PART II being perhaps the most
popular example, is better that the original.  Regardless of the hype
surrounding the change of directors in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, with famed
action director John Woo (BROKEN ARROW and FACE/OFF) replacing sagging
director Brian De Palma (SNAKE EYES and MISSION TO MARS), the sequel
doesn't even measure up to the mediocre standards set by the first.
Having more flat, dead spots than Death Valley, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2
drags whenever Woo isn't blowing something up, switching to slow motion
or staging a kickboxing extravaganza.  And when, on those rare
occasions, he does get the action in gear, he comes up with only a few
ideas, which he uses ad nauseam.  Like in FACE/OFF, his characters wear
false faces.  This is a cute idea that Woo and writer Robert Towne, who
co-wrote the original, abuse by having people conveniently packing a
host of masks for the right occasion.  As soon as a character starts
acting strange, you can be sure that he will shortly rip his fake face
off.
Again starring Tom Cruise as IMF(Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan
Hunt, the movie certainly hopes to bank on his star power to make
megabucks.  Some of the money the studio spent for him and the expensive
stunts might have been better saved until the script was worth shooting.
And with such a paucity of ideas, why was the movie allowed to expand
into over two hours?
An underutilized Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, Ethan's beefy
computer geek.  As Ethan's romantic interest, a fetchingly beautiful
Thandie Newton (BESIEGED) plays thief and IMF recruit, Nyah
Nordoff-Hall.  With mesmerizing eyes that penetrate like lasers and
flowing jet-black hair, Nyah is undeniably gorgeous, but she isn't a
worthy action companion for Ethan.
The plot involves a stolen substance whose purpose is unknown to the
thief, played by the numbers by Dougray Scott.  This parallels the
uncertainty of director Woo over what to do with the murky plot, which
he turns into James Bond-lite.  The mysterious matter turns out to be a
powerful virus -- no, not a computer one -- and a corresponding
anti-virus.  Knowing this alone makes it easy to predict a key "twist"
late in the story.  Don't hold your breath for any scene as imaginative
as the computer room break-in from the original, since there aren't any.
The leaden dialog ("I confess.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to
make money.") only makes the movie's long, slow sections more difficult
to sit through.  You feel like yelling at the screen for them to blow up
something, which inevitably picks up the pace for a while.
A few nice moments does not a movie make.  Even if Woo demonstrates, on
occasion, his gift for setting up vibrant action sequences, this isn't
enough to forgive him for wasting our time through most of the movie.
Almost all of the picture's best footage occurs in the last 15 minutes,
so Woo does send off his audiences with a big adrenaline rush.  The
question is whether it was worth the one and three quarter hour wait.
I, for one, expect more than a 15 minute short from a big-budget action
picture.  Other viewers may feel similarly cheated.
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 runs a long 2:06.  It is rated PG-13 for action
violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 10
and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave it *** 1/2 and was very positive on the
film, the plot and the stars.  He liked it a lot better than the
original, which we watched on DVD last week, since he thought that the
sequel had more action.  He particularly liked the big motorcycle chase.

Watching John Woo's Mission Impossible II, I took note of a good deal of the 
fascinating images and remembered again why visual texts are taking the 
place of written ones.  These violent shots are so well choreographed and 
slick that it is hard not to feast on them as if they were the most tempting 
of junk foods.  The scenes of chasing and fighting in this film are nearly 
as ballet-like as many scenes in The Matrix;  as a matter of fact, in an odd 
nod, the hero and villain in MI2 actually go airborne, their bodies 
colliding like those of Neo and his nemesis.
What this is leading up to is not a lecture but an observation:  a picture 
is not worth a thousand words; it is not worth even one.
What's the foundation to this argument?  We are discussing entertainment 
here.  And the images in modern action flicks move too quickly to digest and 
assimilate while we are watching the flick in the theater for probably the 
first and only time.  There are even gaping holes in the exposition: what is 
the IMF agency and what are Ethan Hunt's incentives to be such a big part of 
it?  Does he have a personal life, and what else does he do for relaxation 
beside the extremest of extreme sports?  Clearly the only scenes of 
character development are the briefest of glimpses of personalities, and all 
of these come second to the all-important fast pace of the plot.
Director John Woo and screenwriter Robert Towne include some nice variations 
on the premise of the old television series.  This time Hunt sees and hears 
about his mission from a pair of high-tech sunglasses, which he pitches away 
just as they `self-destruct.'  Recruiting a key member of his team for the 
mission is very difficult as well.  Hunt's boss Swanbeck (played by Anthony 
Hopkins) has stipulated that it must be the expert thief (but non-spy) Nyah 
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  What they are after is the ruthless thieves 
who have stolen the anti-virus for a synthetic monster bug.  Led by sometime 
IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), these men have murdered hundreds of 
people by crashing a jetliner in the Rockies.  The setup for Hunt and Nyah 
is that they must find out and steal back whatever they can.
Tom Cruise is the co-star of this film.  The other star is the action.  
Cruise's Ethan Hunt is even more polished and buffed than he was in Brian 
DePalma's Mission Impossible.  Cruise's acting is not really different than 
his previous films.  He gets better at it the more times he tries it, but 
the man's range is not wide; he mostly reacts.  What makes his performance 
strong here is his physicality: leaps and kicks and last-second recoveries 
that are a pleasure to watch. Again, thanks to Woo, Cruise has been told 
exactly what to do, and the magic men of dubbing and editing and special 
effects do the rest.
One dimension of  Hunt's character that viewers find endearing is his 
compassion.  Whereas the agent-gone-evil Sean Ambrose takes lives with 
impunity, Hunt hesitates `to harm a hair on a security guard's head.'  For 
putting a value on human life, Hunt acts ironically, beating up on enough of 
Ambrose's men to qualify him as a one-man army.  A cool aspect of Cruise's 
acrobatics is his dead-on marksmanship, his bullets finding their mark even 
when they are fired at the last millisecond, Hunt's body in mid-flip, upside 
down or just off the ground.
The other star?  This stuff is purely eye-candy, as impossible in real life 
as any James Bond stunt.  But when we see Ethan Hunt on his motorcycle, 
jumping and flying down a ramp and through the traces of flame left by an 
enemy's destroyed car, we are enrapt.  Simple fight scenes now require 
expertise in martial arts, and often it's like watching an aggressive dance 
in which the combatants come off the floor without bruises or even 
exhaustion.  Why can't we see at least one tooth being spat out of a bloody 
mouth?
As Nyah Nordoff-Hall, the professional thief, Thandie Newton plays it a 
little too simply.  After initial stubbornness and even an attack (by car) 
on Hunt, Nyah quickly goes down to Hunt's charm, and she smiles widely 
whenever he holds her in his arms.  Newton does, however, show spurts of 
very solid acting.
A motif we hear early  from the scientist who created the monster virus  
is that for every hero, there has to be a villain, and this is clever not 
just because it is self-reflexive.  The sentiment calls up what we hold as 
important values in people: namely, Ethan Hunt's loyalty versus Sean 
Ambrose's betrayal.  Dougray Scott is very good at playing this baddie.  He 
adopts such nonchalance that we hate him without effort.  In a particularly 
suspenseful sequence, Ambrose anticipates Hunt's moves and motivations, 
attempting to thwart Hunt's destruction of the virus.  In a quietly menacing 
performance, Scott leads us to the inevitable confrontation between the two 
super-spies.  (One small problem I may as well mention here is that Ambrose 
-- as well as the movie -- employs too many uncannily accurate masks.)
Ving Rhames is back as the techie, Luther Stickell.  His is purely a support 
role, as he sits in the van with the computers, or fires shoulder-held 
rockets from a chopper piloted by an Australian helper, Billy.  Rhames is 
not given many lines, but his appearance is still authoritative and sure.
The score is mostly transparent.  There are some nice modernizations of the 
Mission: Impossible theme song.  But it's hard to tell if Hans Zimmer 
arranged them or composed variations, along with the original music.
I came out of the theater last night pleased with what I had seen.  But the 
more I think about it, the more I notice the dumbing down of movies.  
Anthony Hopkins must have noticed it when he had to read the line, `Her 
criminal record will be expunged, wiped out.'  This is just a small example 
of a lack of subtlety that, snowballing, will create outright insults to the 
intelligence.  Like books, movies come in various types; let's call them 
heavy watching and light watching.  What we are demanding from Hollywood is 
a large number of light watches  since this is late May, the equivalent of 
fluffy novels that can be read under a beach umbrella, books that require 
little if any real thought.  This is fine, of course.  It's just that I 
don't like a steady diet of junk.

Rated PG-13: intense action, violence, sensuality.
Starring: Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames, Sir Anthony
Hopkins.
In 1996, the world got to see Tom Cruise, in the big screen adaptation of
"Mission: Impossible". Although the film was a huge hit (grossed 181m in the
USA and 465m worldwide) to me it was quite a disappointment. Sure it had
action, special effects, and great acting, but to this day I still cannot
remember there being a REAL plot. A sequel had been in talks for a while, and
now four years later, "M:I-2" finally arrives in theatres, and let me be one to
tell you, its alot better than the first film, and while the plot is just as
thin, I had way too much fun!
Tom Cruise returns as special agent Ethan Hunt, the film opens with Ethan on a
cliff, climbing to the top, which seems impossible, but they its a movie.
Anyway this time his mission if he chooses to accept is: To stop a madman, who
wants to get a newly created virus in his hands, and the antedote, so he can
collect his $37,000,000 pounds (English dollars). Ethan Hunt, has to try and
figure out his plan by having a woman spy Nyah (played by the ever so beautiful
Thandie Newton) to go back to Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and act like she is
his girlfriend again. Of course this is all the plot you get to work with, he
tries to get the virus for his money, and the antedote, but the stunts and the
action is so incredible that in the end all is forgiven!
With Tom Cruise returning as Ethan Hunt, he gives a great performance, if an
over baked performance, when at times he does go over the top, but its classic
Tom Cruise. He fits well into the role, and seems to be having fun. Thandie
Newton is a great actress and was in the 1998 movie "Beloved" with Oprah
Winfrey. Here she is all out with a British accent, and tightfitting clothes.
She is a beautiful actress and a great one at that. Dougray Scott who as in the
hit "Ever After" is the bad guy here, and surprisingly plays a bad guy very
well, his accent fits in very well to the bad guy role. The rest of the cast
includes Sir Anthony Hopkins in a fantastic short role, Ving Rhames as usual is
great too.
John Woo is such a fantastic director, that in his action/stunt sequences, all
is forgiven for the thin plot in the film. I mean some of these car crashes,
explosions, and some spectacularly choreographed fight scenes, that when they
are over all your left with is your mouth wide open. His 1997 film "Face/Off"
was a huge hit in the box office, a huge hit with critics, and a huge hit with
audiences, and this one is destined to be a huge hit at the box office, with
critics and with audiences. The action in the movie is amazing, the acting
great, John's camera angles were jaw dropping, and the movie had great
atmosphere.
So even though like the first film, the plot is as thin as chicken broth, I had
fun with this movie. Its a typical action film, but nothing could have prepared
me for some of the stunts I witnessed in this movie. See it and have fun!

Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) ** (out of four)
Starring Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, Thandie Newton,
Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Roxburgh,
William R. Mapother, and Anthony Hopkins. 
In 1996, Mission: Impossible confused the heck out of
me. A movie way too complex for its own good, only the
heart-poundingly superb action sequences by director
Brian De Palma made it worth watching and remembering.
When I heard that John Woo would direct the inevitable
sequel, I was somewhat excited - it's pretty much one
great director replacing another. But my primary
concern with Mission: Impossible 2 was that the script
would once again outwit the visuals and when Robert
Towne (who co-wrote the first one) signed onto the
project as screenwriter, my worries failed to go away.
You see, Towne also wrote the script for Chinatown,
without a doubt an excellent movie, but one even more
confusing than M:I. To me, Chinatown is the epitome of
confusion; one of those movies you have to see
multiple times to understand the basic plot. The night
before M:I 2 opened, I prayed I wouldn't have to watch
a movie that felt like solving a Rubik's cube. 
To my surprise and chagrin, it turns out that in order
to dumb down a plot, suspense, excitement, and twists
all have to be sacrificed. The movie spends so much
time trying to explain and re-explain the rudimentary
premise that for the first hour and a half, mainly all
there is on screen is lots and lots of talking. A lot
of dialogue can, if executed correctly, make a film
work but if you're expecting a loud, action packed
summer popcorn flick and you get a lot of bland
conversations - it is very difficult to sit through.
Unlike the original Mission: Impossible that
forcefully grabs your attention with a mission gone
fatally awry, there is nothing in the sequel to get
the audience pumped and excited for the final act. To
start off the film, there is a plane crash and then
some beautiful shots of daredevil spy Ethan Hunt (Tom
Cruise) climbing a massive rock without a helmet,
ropes, or even a pair of gloves. But both of these
scenes are lacking; the brief incident involving a
plane crash is far from interesting and the rock
climbing scene is held back by a ridiculous and
distracting folk song playing somewhere in the
background. 
Hunt, conveniently cured from all of the tragic events
that happened in his past, is assigned a new mission
by his mentor (a cameo appearance by Anthony Hopkins).
It turns out that another spy, Sean Ambrose (Dougray
Scott), who occasionally substituted for Hunt to
complete especially dangerous missions, has turned bad
stealing a cell destroying virus called Chimera from a
Russian Scientist. It is Hunt's job to find out what
Ambrose is up to and who his business partners are.
Why does this seemingly routine stand out from others
(or why is this movie-worthy material)? Well there is
a girl involved. Hunt is ordered to use the angelic
and mysterious thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), an
ex-girlfriend of Ambrose, to get closer to his arch
nemesis. The catch is that, in the process, Hunt
almost hypnotically falls for her beauty and really
never wants to let her go. M:I 2 is much more romantic
than its predecessor when it asks the question - which
guy is going to get the girl. The attractive Newton
outperforms Hollywood Hot Shot Tom Cruise and is
definitely the best part of this movie. Her character
contains a certain amount of power that you would
never find a female character hold in, say, a James
Bond movie and change like this is great to see. But
when the plot starts heading into the category of
predictable romance story, I knew that this Mission
Impossible would not have the paranoia and
double-crossing that the original one had. 
When something finally happens (during the last half
an hour of the movie), it seems particularly out of
place from the mild story that started the movie. 
John Woo, whose unique style of choreographed battle
scenes reached its zenith in Face Off, just does not
have control over the film. He makes this movie way
too serious, when it really should have been a guilty
pleasure. For example, instead of Hunt just hitting a
guard in the neck and dragging them into an alleyway,
he does a cheesy Matrix-style back flip/ jump kick in
the air first. After Hunt does this ten times in a
row, it is no longer absorbing, just annoying. Another
aggravation in this movie was the excessive use of a
character wearing a mask and looking like another
character in order to fool everyone except,
unfortunately, the audience. 
The good news is that Towne made the movie
comprehensible. The bad news is that the movie is just
not interesting enough to recommend. A dull first and
second act and an unsuccessfully exaggerated boost of
energy in the third act, makes Mission: Impossible 2
the kind of movie that tries too hard to be what is
should never have even thought of.

         Even though it grossed about $400 million worldwide, has anyone
really been waiting anxiously for four years for a sequel to "Mission:
Impossible"? How many people do you know who really loved (much less
understood) that slick, cold and mostly forgettable movie?
 Apparently Tom Cruise did, and when it comes to getting films
produced, you don't need much more of a supporter than him. Perhaps,
after spending most of the late 1990s exercising his acting muscles in
such weighty fare as "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Magnolia" he's been yearning
for the day when he can show up on the set, throw on a black leather
jacket, jump on a mototrcycle, ride like the wind and forget all about
digging deep within his psyche to find the right emotion. "Besides," he
might rationalize, "I didn't get the Oscar for 'Magnolia,' and my fans
complained there weren't any explosions in 'Eyes Wide Shut,' so why not
give the people what they want?"
 If pyrotechnics and chases are all it takes to satisfy a summer
movie audience, no one can accuse "Mission: Impossible II" -- or "M:
I-2," as the press materials call it -- of shortchanging its viewers.
There's even a smattering of James Bond-style high-tech spy wizardry
thrown in, including a tracking device implanted in the body that can
send your position anywhere on earth to a satellite that zaps the
information back to a computer, and a variety of extraordinarily
realistic masks that can help heroes masquerade as villains and vice
versa.
 Since "M: I-2" is directed by John Woo ("Face-Off," "The
Killer"), it also includes several grandiose gun battles, almost all of
which are slowed down to emphasize, Woo's followers will say, their
balletic qualities. To the masses, however, the movie's continual use
of  slow-motion will probably be unintentionally funny at first, then
just plain irritating. Unfortunately for Woo, American directors have
ripped off his moves so many times now (most notably in "The Matrix,"
which managed both to steal them and improve upon them) it seems as if
the old master is picking his own pocket.
 Flawed as it is, "M: I-2" is still a major improvement over the
original "Mission," which Brian DePalma seemed to direct on auto-pilot.
For starters, it's got a clearly defined plot line; the original was so
unnecessarily complicated it would have taken flow charts and a slide
show to explain.
 Robert Towne, who wrote both films, borrows heavily from Alfred
Hitchcock's 1946 masterpiece "Notorious," as Cruise's super-agent Ethan
Hunt must send the woman he loves -- in this case, an exotic-looking cat
burglar named Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) -- into the arms of
evil in order to get the information he needs to save the world. In
"Notorious," Cary Grant was trying to expose Nazis; here, Hunt has to
locate the lethal Chimera virus, which devours its victims from the
inside out in record time. So the dutiful Nyah beds down with her old
boyfriend Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a wealthy, wicked entrepreneur
who'd like to infect all of Australia with Chimera, then put the cure on
the market at an inflated price. Supervillains these days don't want
ransom money -- they want stock options in bio-tech firms.
 In contrast to most of today's crash-and-smash epics, which
can't go more than five minutes without dropping a one-liner, "M: I-2"
maintains a straight face, even when its characters are doing fairly
ridiculous things. When the funniest guy in the movie is Anthony Hopkins
(who shows up at the beginning and the end of the story as Hunt's boss),
you know you're watching a serious-minded film.
 Disappointingly, "M: I-2" brings back Ving Rhames as Hunt's
former partner Luther Stickell, then keeps him on the bench, plopping
him in front of a computer screen or at the controls of a helicopter
instead of letting him in on the action. That territory is reserved for
Cruise and Cruise alone, and the star does a more than capable job of
handling his stunts, including a final knife fight that, while drawn-out
in the same way as Woo's overblown finale in "Face-Off," generates at
least one major shock that's sure to have everyone gasping
simultaneously.
 Cruise comes up startlingly short, however, in his scenes with
Newton. Although the story is built around their romance, there's
nothing exciting going on between them, and even when Towne follows his
"Notorious" blueprint right down to the scene in which our heroine
poisons herself in the name of duty, Hunt seems only moderately
distressed. Poor Nyah would have gotten a much warmer reception from
Cary Grant. James Sanford

No sooner do I lament the failure of imported Hong Kong superstars to match
their earlier work than I have to retract it.  (You can find the tirade in my
review of "Shanghai Noon").  Just when I least expected it, director John Woo
has given us a feast for the eyes in "Mission: Impossible 2."  It's been a 
long
wait, watching his American movies for hints of the action-master who directed
"The Killer" and "Hard Boiled."  Woo came to Hollywood to make 1993's "Hard
Target" and followed it with "Broken Arrow," "Face/Off," and a few made-for-TV
projects.  All of these movies show at least the fingerprints of Woo in
trademark moments like the hero leaping with two .45 automatics blazing, but
none of the movies reflected the Woo we knew from his Hong Kong works.  I did
not expect this situation to change with "M:I-2," the most-hyped movie of the
summer, because the studio pressure would likely be intense.  But I was wrong

"Good morning Mr. Hunt (Tom Cruise). The picture you see is a Dr.
Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Nekhorvich
was killed in a plane crash while on his way to deliver something to us.
We don't know what but it's really dangerous. IM agent Sean Ambrose
(Dougray Scott) was on the plane, too, and we haven't found the body.
We're not sure where he is, if he's screwed us, or exactly what your
mission is, other than to stop something really nasty from happening.
We're sure you'll figure it out along the way. Oh, you can only use two
agents and you must include a civilian thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie
Newton) on the team. We know we're not supposed to configure your team,
but we can discuss that when you come over and discuss the matter in
person with us (Anthony Hopkins). If you or any member of you IM team
should be caught or killed, yada yada yada. Have a nice day."
With all the baggage of the past buried and forgotten, John Woo takes up
the director's reigns, overseeing the one-man strike force that is Ethan
Hunt, leader of the Impossible Mission "team," in Mission: Impossible 2.
Woo, whose visual sense can make a boy giddy, lets loose with both
barrels and all the visual fireworks he can put on the big screen.
That's a good thing 'cuz the M:I2 script stinks. Like its big screen
predecessor this flick has very little in common with the television
series it is based upon, other than a self-destructing set of
instructions and characters pulling rubber mask disguises off their
faces. We don't compare to Source Material. Fans of the series can
figure out what's different from the paragraph above.
Then again, it's summertime, when all most of us want out of a movie is
onscreen fireworks and a reason to plunge our mitts into the
extra-large-super-sized popcorn up to our elbows. M:I2 delivers that in
spades, refusing to cut fight scenes that run on too long, resorting to
makeup gimmicks instead of developing a great story and, in short,
refusing to roll over and play dead when its story was done. It's almost
as if the writers and Woo sat down and figured out what would be really
cool to do and which really cool bits would be even cooler if shot in
slow motion, and then wrote the script around them. That means a
motorcycle duel, a half naked Cruise on a rock and the gun in the sand
bits that are in the teevee commercial, and a wee bit of "aerobatic
insanity" that reprises something in the last flick and which had the
audience happily giggling.
Absolutely giddy. Myself included. I told you.
If you're a novice to the concept, the IM is a secret force that
manipulates situations to bring about conclusions that punish the evil
guys and ensure that truth, justice and the American way win out. In
this case, it's the story of one renegade agent and his possession of an
artificially created strain of influenza that could devastate the world.
The "good" IM team -- our heroes include Ving Rhames, the only returnee
from M:I1 and John Polson as an almost utterly dispensable guy with an
Australian accent, useful since the film is set in Australia -- must
track and destroy another -- Richard Roxbury is the muscle on bad guy
Ambrose's side -- using the civilian and a small tracking device
implanted in Newton's ankle, as bait. The notion of one IM team against
another one is a good one. The problem is that one team leader knows all
about the moves of the other, and not vice versa. The bad guys also have
all the IM technology, so how they miss the tracking device is news to
me.
 No, it's not. It's scriptwriters ignoring the obvious. It's
scriptwriters ignoring what they've written earlier in the script. But,
just as in the last flick, this series is not so much about the story as
it is about Ethan Hunt, $20 million dollar action figure. That being the
case, Tom Cruise is absolute dynamite in black clothing. He makes a
great John Woo movie action toy. The action sequences, as in everything
John Woo does, are the reason to lay out hard cash to see the flick.
Bullets fly. Explosions, um, explode. Cruise does unbelievable physical
things believably and gets a love interest to boot. So the hell with
history and any requirement of logic in the script.
Buy the extra big popcorn and stick to the small soda. This sequel is
less complicated than the last one, but if you have to make a quick run,
you'll still miss something important.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mission: Impossible 2, he would have
paid...
It's a summertime, popcorn dateflick. All sweetener and no nutritional
value at all.

Rating: Rating: Near Miss  (2 out of 4 stars)
Towne and Woo take some chances with the burgeoning Mission Impossible
franchise and I'd like to say they pay off
handsomely. Fact is, they might owe you some change back. The pair,
under the supervision of producer Tom Cruise, have
tried to make the movie more intimate, cutting down the multi-character
team concept of the series and previous film, into an
american version of the Bond franchise. It's a star turn for Cruise and
he projects a sinewy sexiness with the material at hand.
It's just a shame he didn't have more to work with.
In paring down unessential elements, Towne neglected to strengthen what
was left. Relationships are left one sided and
motivations are murky. They've tried to make a humanistic spy film, but
stopped short of fleshing out the characters. Even the
main story  is simplistic, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Mission Impossible agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is called upon to recover a
package stolen by  renegade IMF agent Sean
Ambrose (Scott). IMF knows nothing about the package, save it is of
value and a potential threat to the world. In a prickly
meeting with his supervisor (an unbilled and Machiavellian flavored
Anthony Hopkins), Hunt is told he can assemble any IMF
members he deems necessary to his mission, but first and foremost, he
must enlist the aid of  master thief, Nyah Hall (Newton).
Eventually, we're shown that the package is the antidote to a lethal
super virus code named Chimera, which was developed
under the supervision of an evil pharmaceutical supervisor. Ambose aims
to loose the virus upon the world, holding the only
cure in is possession. It's not the most muscular of premises, but it's
solid and has potential.
Rather than have the audience simply "oh" and "ah" at the special
effects, Towne has admirably tried to set up some intriguing
character motivations. Hunt and Ambrose have a history from their IMF
days. It's one filled with mutual dislike and perhaps a
touch of jealousy on Ambrose's part. Nothing more is said about it.
Ambrose has a homicidal hatred of Hunt and properly
explored, could have given their confrontations far more impact that
good guy fights the bad guy. It's a tango performed with
shoelaces tied. It's a dance of death in which both sides stumble. Why
does Ambrose hate Hunt so? What made him leave
IMF? Was Cruise recruited to go after him because of the unspoken past
history? These are questions left unanswered.
Ambrose is unremarkable in his villainy. He is simply a petulant, greedy
and clever man. He isn't given any idiosyncrasies that
make him particularly fearsome or memorable. Seeing Hopkins brief
visage, I couldn't help but think of the menace of his
Hannibal Lechter character and how this film could have benefited from
such a chill inducing villain. Instead we're treated to
meglomaniac-lite.
Cruise and Newton not only are requisite gorgeous to look at, they  draw
you in with their "you are my soul mate" looks they
give each other. They share a primal attraction that is tastefully
shown. There are no shots of bare breasts, or lingeringly filmed,
titillating sex scenes. They don't seek to learn much from each other,
content to bask in each other's presence. If not for the
strength of Cruise's personality and the waif-like vulnerability of
Newton, the scenes, wispy as they are, could have fallen flat.
As it stands, there is a certain charm to watching their interaction.
Heaving a huge stone into pond of their relationship is the
revelation that Nyah once was Ambrose's lover. Instead of this fact
causing a ripple effect with later events, it makes nary a
splash.
Another misstep by Towne and Woo is that we aren't shown why Nyah would
have been attracted to Ambrose. Because of
this, their encounters are drained of dramatic tension. Just as with
Hunt and Ambrose, the dramatic impact is dulled by not
having more back story on the pair. For Ambrose's part, his attraction
seems based upon a pure animal lust, evidenced in an
almost comical scene where Nyah disrobes in front of him and his jaw
drops in glassy eyed lust. I felt as if I was watching the
Big Bad Wolf sizing up Goldilocks.
At times, the scenes of exposition with the characters becomes clock
watchingly slow. Fortunately the action scenes, which are
back loaded at the end of the movie are gripping, beautiful and just
plain fun to watch. Hunt breaks into the pharmacy company
in a sequence that whispers of the memorable Pentagon break-in scene in
the first Mission Impossible movie. Hunt, time and
again, dispatches foes with Woo's trademark, slow motion, ballet style
martial arts. Here's where the film really flexes it's
muscles.
Woo throws it all at us, explosions, car chases, motorcycle chases, two
fisted gun battles underscored by classical music, each
done in his distinctive style. Older time Woo fans will smile knowingly
at his usage of religious backdrops and birds on the wing.
There's an engrossing fight between Hunt and Ambrose that is thrilling
not just due to the camera work, which shows you the
impact of each blow, but the lack of music. It's a mano a mano fight
where all that is heard for periods are the sounds of kicks
landing and grunts of pain. Hunt doesn't dispatch Ambrose easily. It's
fight in which there is a sense of failure on Hunt's part, no
mean feat.
In stripping away the team feel of the movie, Ving Rhames, in particular
gets the proverbial short end of the stick. A resourceful and powerful
screen presence, he is reduced to being a one dimensional sidekick. It's
painful to see the big man shoehorned
into such a miniscule role. His character seems to be around only as a
link to the first film. Despite it's flaws, his portrayal of a
good agent finding redemption was a nice side story to the first film.
MI:2 is a fun, thrilling to watch film when it's not dragging itself
through the mire of exposition. With the talents behind such films as
Chinatown (Towne), the Killer and Face/Off (Woo), I expected a bit more.
It's entertaining fare, but hardly the stuff of
memorable movie going.

        If there's anything to be learned from "Mission: Impossible 2" it's
that, contrary to popular belief, machine guns really aren't all that
dangerous.
        I can't for the life of me remember how many times magazinefuls of
bullets are unloaded at our spry hero Ethan Hunt, yet he simply ducks,
dodges, grins, and returns fire as if there were no tomorrow.
        Unfortunately there IS a tomorrow, and it's arrived in the form of
a very unnecessary follow-up to a very poor big-screen version of a great
'60's television series, aka "Brian De Palma mucked up the first one; now
let's watch John Woo muck up the second."
        Woo, the man responsible for such masterful Hong Kong actioners as
"A Better Tomorrow," "The Killer," and "Hard-Boiled," has style--that
cannot be denied.  But substance?  "Mission: Impossible 2" contains some of
the most inane dialogue ever uttered on the silver screen.  How about "I'm
not going to lose you" sobbed to a cute one-night stand?  And remember the
fantastic cleverness of the original TV series so blatantly absent from the
first "MI" movie?  Well it's even more absent here.  Second time around,
the only plot twist is the ol' rubber mask removal trick which happens at
least five times until, frankly, it's lost ALL of its appeal.
        Of course, Tom Cruise is super dreamy even though his incessant
grinning grates on the nerves of not only the arch villain (played by
Dougray Scott, the handsome prince to Drew Barrymore's Cinders in "Ever
After").  In fact, Tom grins throughout the ENTIRE first act until his
boss, played by the gracefully-aging and uncredited Anthony Hopkins, makes
some crack about this not being Mission: Difficult.  Harrumph!
        But come on.  This film has NOTHING whatsoever to do with "MI"-the
television series.  Bruce Geller's creation boasted intricate,
sophisticated plots that wowed you with their gadgets and complex
ingenuity.  Once the facts were on the table, the mission--should Jim
Phelps (now Ethan Hunt) and his allies choose to accept it (they invariably
did)--truly did seem impossible to pull off.  The mission in "M:i-2" is to
hire three people, make sure one of them is Thandie Newton, and recover a
stolen virus named Chimera.  Now how impossible is that?
        Newton, of course, provides the sexy love interest and she performs
this task admirably.  The other two agents are Ving Rhames, who knows how
to use a computer, and some Australian guy who knows how to fly a
helicopter.  So far this sounds like Mission: Piece o' Cake.  Scott, as the
villain, is refreshingly wholesome--and perfectly decent--but even he gets
stuck in too many obvious situations.  How many films have you seen in
which the bad guy threatens to neaten the tip of someone's pinkie as if it
were a slim Cuban panatela?
        If the only problem with "M:i-2" were its sparkling lack of
originality, then audiences might still find some enjoyment in the
interminable action sequences.  But even these are lacking Woo's trademark
sophistication.  There's gunfire a-plenty, but it all seems rather noisy
and unchoreographed.  Tom and Dougray engage in a motorcycle showdown in
which they race at each other at 100mph, leap from their mounts, collide in
mid-air, wrestle each other to the ground, and STILL find the energy to
kick each other in the head for fifteen minutes.  This was easily the
film's funniest scene, according to my pre-teen daughters.
        Likewise, the scariest scene is when Thandie injects the virus into
her own arm--"I just wasn't thinking!"--and the dumbest scene is when
Dougray shoots his own henchman without first checking to see if he was
wearing a Tom Cruise mask.  And to think Robert Towne ("Chinatown") wrote
this screenplay.
        It's never boring, but "Mission: Impossible 2" might well be the
silliest movie you'll see this summer.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 (director: John Woo; screenwriter: Robert Town
based on a story by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga and the television
series created by Bruce Geller; cinematographer: Jeffrey L. Kimball;
editor: Christian Wagner/Steven Kemper; cast: Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt),
Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose), Thandie Newton (Nyah Nordoff-Hall),
Richard Roxburgh (Hugh Stamp), John Polson (Billy Baird), Brendan
Gleeson (McCloy), Rade Sherbedgia (Dr. Nekhorvich),Ving Rhames (Luther
Stickell), Anthony Hopkins (Hunt's boss, Swanbeck), William R. Mapother
(Wallis), 2000)
M: I-2, the sequel to Mission Impossible, is a James Bond wannabe film,
but it fails to even come close to that film in wit, humor, and
entertainment value. It tries to be a spy/romance movie, but without any
suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes
who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses. It is a film that
prefers techie gadgets to anything human. The coolest thing about this
movie, was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing
about the movie, was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols. The
film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence.
Except for the choreographed action sequences, the film was dull for
three-quarters of its time, filled with too many dead spots in its story
to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance
that developed. As for the action scenes, they might look good to those
who are converts to violence in their films, but their advertisement for
sadistic responses, is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence, which
makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off
by the gratuitous cruelty seen.
M: I-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes, but it is hard to
get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue. The film
looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus, at that point. The
only thing that kept me awake, was the horrible music composed by Hans
Zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous
action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more
noticeable in the wrong way.
It's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry TV
series. But its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish
because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it, and it
failed to produce a story that had any substance. John Woo ("Broken
Arrow" /"Face/Off") is good at doing car chases, choreographed fights
with midair flips and kung-fu kicks, slo-mo shots of two guns blazing,
and of fire explosions, but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and
suspense. The star of the film and co-producer, Tom Cruise, and his
romantic interest, Thandie Newton, are miscast. Cruise is no James Bond
and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair
and innocuous smile, as he tries to carry off this macho role, while
Thandie is not an action-film girl, and seems like a fish- out-of-water
in this one. Their romance didn't work, not only was it tepid and not
sexy, but it wasn't convincing.
The film opens with dizzying speed, perhaps with the hope that a
befuddled audience is its best bet for success. We will be in three
different locations instantaneously: Sydney, the American Southwest, and
Seville. First, we are in Sydney, Australia, where a scientist with a
muffled Russian accent, Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade), mentions that he created
a deadly killer virus called Chimera and an antidote for it. He also
mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain. Which explains the
film's mythic theme...as we enter the world of comic book myths on good
and evil.
The one who played the villain, Dougray Scott, does so in a
one-dimensional gruff tone, which did not distinguish him in that role.
At least, if the film got the villain part right, it might have had some
fun with this nonsense.
Soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts
called Dimitri, but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set
it on automatic pilot and crash it into the Rocky Mountains. Before they
crash the plane and parachute out of it, the one who was posing as
Dimitri, turns out to be Sean Ambrose (Scott), a rogue member of the
IMF, which is a CIA-like clone. He steals the package with the antidote,
peels off a latex mask, which is a replica of the hero of the story,
Ethan Hunt (Cruise), who had posed as Dimitri to the scientist before
and had thereby gained his trust. Sean and his group of terrorists carry
out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then
to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices.
We already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in Face/Off and in the
original Mission Impossible, which as convoluted a plot as that film
had, it was still a superior film to this sequel. Woo has run this
peeling mask routine into the ground, as it is used so often in this
film by both sides, so much so, that it blurs any ethical character
differences between good guy or villain. It makes it seem as if anyone
could be another character, which distorts the reality of the film and
makes it impossible for the film to make much sense.
Next we are in a mountain range in the American Southwest, and Ethan is
on vacation, hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool,
when a helicopter with his boss Anthony Hopkins aboard, delivers via a
rocket launcher, a pair of talking sunglasses. Hunt learns his next
mission is to retrieve the Chimera package and he is allowed to pick two
regular IMF agents to help, Billy Baird (John Polson) and Luther
Stickell (Ving Rhames), with Luther running a high-gadget computer, but
he also must get a jewel thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie) to join his
team. He is told, as an incentive to recruit her, all her criminal
charges will be dropped. Hopkins then signs off with the tag line:This
message will self-destruct in five seconds. Actually, with the departure
of Hopkins, it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at
this point.
In Seville, Hunt recruits Nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel
heist and a subsequent car chase, where he nearly runs her Audi sports
car over the side of a mountain road. He also falls for her when this
was only supposed to be a business deal, and learns that she is valuable
because her ex-boyfriend was Sean Ambrose and that he still wants to
f*ck her. The IMF team then inject a location tracer chip into her to
spot Sean so she can go f*ck him, as she leads them to his hide-out in
the seaside of Australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous
cohort, the South African, Hugh Stamp (Richard Roxburgh).
 Robert Towne, the screenwriter, who contributed to the first "Mission,"
who is noted for doing "Chinatown" --  writes a colorless, pedestrian
script, one that fails even to be funny in a camp way.
The terrorists, who aim to rule the world, are interested in owning 51
percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options, as they plan
to infect Sydney with the virus and have their company sell the
antidote, insuring that they will make billions on the stock.
Ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of Nyah, with his only
conflict being who is more important to save first. Ethan does this
rescue against all odds, as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight
biotech company, fight it out with Sean and the other terrorists, and
rescue Nyah, who injected herself with the virus to hinder Sean's
getting it, as the only way to transport the virus is through another
person or from the vaccine needle. Ethan rescues her by doing stunt
riding on a motorcycle, using kick-boxing, winning a shootout, throwing
a full John Wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists, making some more
use out of that peeling mask bit, and by being completely fearless and
larger than life, while he kick's everyone's ass. If I was only
entertained by this...I could have lived with it. But this film was so
badly made, that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball
game, seeing only the slam-dunks, but with  the game itself being
excluded from the telecast. In any case, this is a critic-proof film,
and will in all probability do well in the box office, as it was made to
appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this
one easy to buy into.

Susan Granger's review of "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2" (Paramount Pictures)
PERSONAL NOTE: My son, Don Granger, is the Paramount Pictures exec who super=
vised this film so if this review sounds a bit biased - so be it.
   As a fan of the original "Mission Impossible" TV series,
I'm delighted that this sequel returns to its roots, complete with the
intriguing, unexpected disguises and inventive gadgetry updated to the
21st century. Tom Cruise plays special agent Ethan Hunt who's
recruited from a rock-climbing vacation in Utah for a new,
globe-hopping mission by his IMF contact, Anthony Hopkins. His team
consists of a computer genius, Ving Rhames, and a beautiful thief,
Thandie Newton. Their target is a terrifyingly destructive super-flu
virus. The deadly virus and its antidote were stolen from Biocyte
Pharmaceuticals in Sydney, Australia, by a bitter, formidable
IMF-agent, Dougray Scott, who threatens to ignite a worldwide
plague. To achieve his goal, Tom must not only overcome all the
physical obstacles that Scott tosses his way but also his own
emotional turmoil when he realizes that he and Scott are both in love
with the same woman.  "That could be difficult," says Tom. "This isn't
'Mission Difficult'," retorts Hopkins. "It's 'Mission Impossible.'
Difficult should be a walk in the park!" Screenwriter Robert Towne
concocted the clever, intelligent script, while filmmaker John Woo
proves why he's the most imaginative action director working today,
combining reality with surrealism. The "acrobatic insanity" of the
incredible stunts will have your adrenaline rushing - not to mention
the firepower and explosions. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Mission Impossible 2" is an exciting, action-packed 10. It's a sleek,
stylistic adventure thriller, a fun-filled popcorn picture that will
not self-destruct.

Mission: Impossible 2 
Tom Cruise is back as super secret agent Ethan Hunt who must save the world - 
not from nuclear war or terrorists - but from a lethal man-made virus. An 
original idea to be sure, but the execution of the story is not. Instead of 
being too confusing like the last time, this time it's almost too simple and 
certain key plot points and sequences are waaaaaay over the top and 
unbelievable. Action filmmaker John Woo certainly puts a lot more energy into 
this film than Brian De Palma did in 1996. We can really buy Cruise as a 
genuine action performer (the long, drawn-out fight scene at the end is proof 
of this). 
Whatever you're expecting this film to be will, it WILL be, so enjoy the 
ride.

_Mission:_Impossible_II_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Brevity, it seems, is but a side benefit of Paramount's insistence that
_Mission:_Impossible II_ (as the film is called in its main title
sequence) be referred to by its promotional title, _M:I-2_.  The shorter
title is a better fit for the John Woo-directed big-budget follow-up to
the smash 1996 TV spinoff, for it never quite feels like a
_Mission:_Impossible_ film.  For that matter, it also never completely
feels like a John Woo film.  Fortunately, the strange middle ground
_M:I-2_ achieves proves to be more than enough to satisfy anyone looking
for a jolt of summer movie action.
However, it takes a while for that jolt to kick in.  Woo is one of the
best, if not the absolute best, directors of action films working today,
and that's not necessarily because inventive ways of choreographing and
editing gunfights (though that does play a large part).  His best films,
in particular those he made in his native Hong Kong, were also just as
much concerned about the larger emotional and psychological issues in the
story.  His masterpiece, 1989's _The_Killer_ (which he also wrote),
centered around a hitman's attempt at redemption; his best American film,
1997's _Face/Off_ (which he didn't write--but certainly felt written
especially for him) explored the common Woo theme of duality by having
two men on opposite sides of the law swap faces and identities.
By contrast, _Mission: Impossible_ is a spy caper, and by design it is
more concerned with the nuts-and-bolts of convoluted espionage plots than
anything about the characters.  So in _M:I-2_'s plot-establishing first
two-thirds, Woo obviously doesn't have his heart in it, and the plodding
pace is nowhere near the consistently rapid pulse Brian DePalma gave the
first film.  There are no big shootout set pieces for Woo to strut his
stuff, so he is made to have whatever fun he can with a stylish but
largely by-the-book car chase between our hero, Impossible Mission Force
agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (a ravishing Thandie
Newton), a sexy thief.  Hunt is ordered by his nameless superior (an
unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit her for a mission to recover a
deadly virus stolen by rogue agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).
Cruise, who also produced, took the criticisms of the first
_Mission:_Impossible_'s labyrinthine plot to heart, hence the simple plot
that can be succinctly summarized by the above sentence.  As such,
_M:I-2_ is much easier to follow than its predecessor, but it is also
less in the spirit of the original concept of the show.  Contrary to one
of the film's best lines in the film (delivered by Hopkins' character),
the retrieval-of-the-virus assignment is more "mission difficult" than
"mission impossible."  As ridiculously complex as the first film's story
was, it made for a more engrossing and convincing spy yarn.
Perhaps this was a concession to Woo and his style, for scripter Robert
Towne also makes some attempt at a more intimate subplot, building a love
triangle between Hunt, Nyah, and Ambrose.  But it's not particularly
well-developed, for I never detected much of a sincere connection between
Nyah and her former love Ambrose, robbing this element of the story of
any tension or suspense.  Chalk up this weakness to Woo as well, for he
skews the balance by effectively using his natural visual flair toward
establishing the link between Hunt and Nyah, whose portrayers are nicely
matched.
So far, not so good, and just when one is ready to completely dismiss
_Mission:_Impossible II_, at the end of the second act Towne's script
finally plops Hunt in the middle of an impossible situation and gives Woo
for the chance he'd been waiting for the entire film.  With the
bullets--as well as many people--flying about a laboratory in a
spectacular shootout, everyone involved in the production appears to be
galvanized: all the cast members (especially Cruise, who clearly gives
his all) and, above all, Woo himself.  This sequence is classic Woo in
every way; not only is the gunplay exciting and strangely beautiful to
behold, there are also the broad, operatic emotional strokes that lend
weight to the pyrotechnics.  (However, one of Cruise's big lines is a
near-laughable, almost word-for-word duplication of Daniel Day-Lewis'
signature declaration in _The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_.)
Once you get Woo started, there's no stopping him, and the final 40
minutes of _M:I-2_ is far and away the most electrifying action
filmmaking one is likely to see on the big screen this year. 
Everything--from the slow-mo shots of near-balletic fight moves to the
omnipresent flying birds--one expects from a John Woo action film finally
arrives, and he does not disappoint, and not just in an action
standpoint.  The underwhelming story resolves itself in a satisfying way;
however, it is somewhat hampered by the problem that plagued the end of
_Face/Off_: signs that point toward a more complex--and typically
Woo--close are erased by an overwhelming sunniness.
While Woo defies the odds and performs a spectacular rescue of _M:I-2_
in its final third, it's clear that, for all his brilliance, he simply is
not the filmmaker best suited to this franchise's constricting formula. 
_M:I-2_ ultimately delivers the goods and is certain to be a huge hit,
and one hopes that with the new doors opened by it, Woo will return to
writing his own material, a key factor to his finest films--one of which
_M:I-2_, while ending up quite good in its own right, certainly won't be
mistaken for.

A film like this rarely lives up to its hype.  First, it's the sequel to
a movie that took in over $180 million domestically and over $420
worldwide in 1996.  Helming the project is arguably the greatest
shoot-em-up director of all-time, and the screenplay was written by a
four-time Oscar nominee.  Its acting lead is one of the world's biggest
stars, who is only a few months removed from his third Oscar nod.  Heck,
there's even an unbilled Oscar winner thrown for good measure.  And then
there's the little matter of every other potential summer blockbuster
cutting a wide path around the film's May 24th release date.
Sadly, M:I-2 doesn't live up to the hype.  I'm not saying it's bad
(although everybody else in the theatre seemed to think so)  just
disappointing.  Believe me, I was pulling for it to set the action film
standard for the next four or five years, like M:I-2 director John Woo's
Face/Off did in 1997.  While M:I-2 is better than the last couple James
Bond flicks, it struggles to even duplicate the level of entertainment
created by the first M:I film.  It's still entertaining and fun, in a
check-your-brain-at-the-box-office kind of way.
Tom Cruise (Magnolia) returns as Ethan Hunt, IMF (Impossible Missions
Force) pointman, who, as the film opens, has his rock-climbing vacation
interrupted by an emergency summons to Seville, Spain, where the IMF
boss (played by an uncredited Anthony Hopkins, Titus) dispatches him to
apprehend a malevolent Scotsman (shades of Fat Bastard?) that has
designs on threatening the world with a deadly virus called Chimera.
To complete his mission, Hunt nabs M:I's only other holdover in Luther
Stickell (Ving Rhames, Bringing out the Dead), as well as a wisecracking
agent played by Aussie actor John Polson (The Boys).  Hunt is also
instructed to recruit the services of a civilian master thief named Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton, Besieged), who also happens to be an
ex-lover of Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott, Ever After), the IMF's target.
Hunt and Nyah become soulmates after about thirty seconds of contact, at
which point M:I-2 becomes slightly derailed by a lot of unnecessary,
vomit-inducing romance, including a really corny line that I think may
have been stolen from Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans.
Like the original M:I film, the sequel is full of double-crossing via
rubber masks, which look a lot cooler here than they did four years ago,
thanks to advancements in CGI.  There are also some nifty gadgets, such
as a satellite that can capture detailed video of anyone in the world.
And like Face/Off (or any Woo film), there's plenty of double-fisted
gunplay, birds taking flight, martial arts, slow-motion action, and a
chase scene that goes on for a bit too long (it was boats in Face/Off
and it's motorcycles here).  That is to say, there's plenty of this
stuff in the last fifteen minutes.  The rest of the film is pretty light
on all of the exciting things that you would expect from Woo.  In fact,
Woo fans will probably be bitterly disappointed, but then again, they
have slightly unreal expectations because of the director's previous
work.
M:I-2 has a plot so convoluted that they have the bad guy narrate what's
happening during one sequence, and it will still leave you scratching
your head (people complained that the first film was too hard to follow,
which is probably why they tried to add the explanation here).  Hey,
this isn't Chinatown (which screenwriter Robert Towne also penned) -
it's an action flick, implying that there should be action throughout
the film, and not just the last fifteen minutes.
Another big problem is with Scott, who overacts so badly that I thought
he was doing a bad Scottish accent (turns out he's actually from
Scotland).  He's certainly not physically intimidating, and he damn well
isn't creepy enough to pull off a `psychological madman'-type role, like
Alan Rickman in Die Hard, or even Robert Carlyle in The World is Not
Enough.  Is he evil?  Maybe.  Is he diabolical?  Definitely not.
Ambrose doesn't come off any more threatening than anybody else with a
sneer and an accent.
Cruise is simply adequate and, apparently, too short to don the flowing
black trenchcoat usually worn by the lead actors in Woo's films (see Nic
Cage in Face/Off or Chow Yun-Fat in anything).  While M:I-2 has added
the romantic angle, Cruise's character has become a little more human,
but there still isn't much to like about Ethan Hunt, other than hearing
Rhames call him `Efan' instead of `Ethan.'  In short (sorry, Tom), M:I-2
is ridiculously unbelievable, which is something that every entertaining
action flick should be.  But it should have been so much better.

     If I didn't know any better, I'd swear Tom Cruise was trying to steal
a franchise out from under Pierce Brosnan. Take a look at MISSION: 
IMPOSSIBLE 2 for a moment, and see if the elements don't sound familiar: 
A government agent on a dangerous mission. A villain with a dastardly
plot. A beautiful romantic interest. International locations. Stunts,
action sequences and high-tech gadgetry a-plenty. The James Bond series
may be healthier than ever after the $125 million success of THE WORLD IS
NOT ENOUGH, but that doesn't mean a new kid on the block might not be
interested at taking a poke at 007's 35-year stranglehold on
espionage-as-big-budget-entertainment. Add a phenomenally talented action
director like John Woo to the mix, and maybe its time to ask Q for a
little Cruise control on the old Aston-Martin. Right?
     Not at all, as it turns out. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 finds Cruise's
Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt called on to recover a valuable
package nabbed by renegade IMF operative Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). To
help suss out Ambrose's plan, Hunt recruits Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), a
professional thief who also happens to be Ambrose's ex-mistress. They
discover that the package contains the antidote to an Ebola-like super-flu
virus called Chimera,  developed by a nasty pharmaceutical company to
build demand for a cure. Re-teamed with computer expert Luther Stickell
(Ving Rhames), Hunt has only days before Ambrose threatens the world with
the plague of the 21st century.
     John Woo's last film was 1997's FACE/OFF, the latest in a long line
of films (A BETTER TOMORROW, THE KILLER) that showed the director's gift
for mixing outrageous action sequences with strong character content. 
Don't expect any such complexities from MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE 2. Robert
Towne's script tries to provide an anchor in Hunt's relationship with
Nyah, but it materializes so instantaneously that it's impossible to give
it any weight or consequence. Dougray Scott, meanwhile, is an effectively
nasty villain, but I'll be damned if I could figure out the history
between him and Hunt that's supposed to give their tete-a-tete more sock. 
Anthony Hopkins turns up for a couple of uncredited scenes as Hunt's
vaguely menacing new superior, then disappears without any further
acknowledgement of his vague menace. And Cruise's Hunt is a great big
super-heroic enigma, just a guy who shoots and kicks and rides a pretty
mean motorcycle. Every time Woo slows things down for a moment of dramatic
significance, it's just a longer time to dwell on the fact that there
really isn't any dramatic signficance.
     And unfortunately, he slows things down for about three-quarters of
the film. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 still could have been a great ride with
plenty of that trademark Woo action, and it gets off to a rousing start
with a sequence showcasing Hunt doing a little recreational rock-climing. 
Then the film shudders to a stop, and doesn't hit the gas again for over
an hour. Once it does get going again, it doesn't really stop until the
closing credits -- there are whiz-bang car chases, two-guns-a-blazing John
Woo shooting matches, slow-mo slugfests and bombs going off like the whole
movie was timed to the end of the "1812 Overture." It's great stuff, even
if some of the devices are a bit too familiar from Woo's other films, but
by the time it finally rolls around it's almost too late. An action film
with this much exposition better make the exposition worth our while, or
the audience will just end up wondering why it was wasting valuable action
time.
     The original 1996 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was nobody's idea of classic
cinema, but it did have that undeniably nerve-wracking computer room
break-in sequence to go with its high-energy finale. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2
nods to that highlight in yet another break-in sequence, along with a nice
gag about Hunt's preferred operational style. I had hoped for more than
homage to a mediocre blockbuster from John Woo -- something with its own
show-stopping set pieces and a compelling story to boot. But ultimately,
there's no financial point to cooking up brilliant storytelling for a
franchise, because people will come no matter what the film is "about." 
That's why Brosnan, MGM and the estate of Ian Fleming can rest easy that
there will always be a market for their films, the Tom Cruises of the
world be hanged. There's enough furiously paced Woo action in the final
forty minutes to keep MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 from crashing and  burning; 
there's just not enough to make it anything special, nor enough depth to
the story to fill in the blanks between chases. Anyone who's followed
Woo's career knows he's better than this material, but maybe there's only
so much even a gifted film-maker can do with a product that's first and
foremost about a brand name. The name on the director's chair can only get
in the way.

   The United States may be the world's only superpower but
this country is hardly invulnerable to the machinations of
rogue states.  Even discounting a change of plans from the
leadership in Russia (who still fester about being second best
and surrounded by East Europeans wild about NATO), the
rogue states like Iraq, Iran and Libya may have their
strategies.  Those approaches center on non-nuclear
terrorism such as chemical and biological warfare. 
Amazingly enough, deadly bugs have not been unleashed
against the West, at least not to its knowledge, but that real
possibility gives "Mission: Impossible 2" its one and perhaps
only foundation for grounding and credibility.  "M:I-2" is not a
roller coaster ride but it sure is a excursion on motorcycles
and choppers and for fancy cars that have been made just for
the pleasure of blowing them sky-high.  A John
Woo ("Face/Off," "Hard Boiled," "The Young Dragons")
picture, "M:I-2" will probably be as popular in the 54-year-old
director's native Guangzhou as it is here in the West
because, after all, who can resist a video game that
surrounds its audience while bathing us in a torrent of sound
from waves crashing against the shore at Sydney harbor to
Hitchcockian birds flapping their wings to warn the villains of
the approach of the good guy to the ever-present rat-tat-tat of
machine guns that never come close to disabling the
superstar?
   Made in the James Bond style without the promiscuous
womanizing or the bevy of locations, "Mission: Impossible 2"
is filmed principally in the lovely city of Sydney, Australia with
an opening scene from Moab, Utah and an L.A. set design
resembling the arches and caves of Seville, Spain.  The
convoluted plot, which borrows a theme from Terry Gilliam's
"Twelve Monkeys," revolves around a scheme to infect
Sydney's three million people with the deadly Chimera virus
for starters, then to sell the antidote to those who have not
yet developed the fatal symptoms of the disease twenty
hours later.  As special agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and
his buddies Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird
(John Polson) hone in on those hoping to use drug company
options to become richer than Bill Gates, they use Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) the former girl friend of
villainous Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) to help in their
thankless efforts to save all the people downunder.
   Action-adventure films are difficult to evaluate because on
the one hand they may keep the audience on the edge of
their seats in spite of themselves (as this one does), but on
the other hand they are loaded with implausibilities (which is
OK), with same ol' same ol' formula (which is not), and with
that flagrant Ebertian flaw of the scoundrel's getting the jump
on the protagonist (at least twice) and failing to snuff him
because he's more interested in talking than in shooting (an
annoying flaw).  
   On balance, "M:I-2" is a disappointing foray, a generic
piece of very expensive filmmaking that lacks the
James Bond wit and eclat while at the same time highlights a
romance that is as sexless as it is inconceivable.
   Ethan Hunt got his name because he is the sort of guy who
must be unhappy when he is not working at hunting criminals. 
To emulate the chase, he risks his life on vacation by
climbing Moab, Utah's colorful red rocks.  Interrupted by his
Impossible Missions Force boss (in an unbilled cameo by
Anthony Hopkins), he is instructed to track down the evil
Scotsman, Sean Ambrose, who is concocting a plan to give
millions of people a bad, bad cold.  After tracking
down Ambrose's ex girl to involve her in the scheme, he
faces off against the criminals in more ways than one,
principally by the nifty use of rubber masks that have us
thinking, "Will the real Tom Cruise take it off and stand up?" 
There is more than a single leader with evil intents in this
drug scheme that involves the CEO of a pharmaceutical
company (played by Brendan Gleeson who was a helluva lot
better in John Boorman's "The General"), and that the bad
guys still tip off the heroes by affixing flashing counters on
their explosive devices.
   Dougray Scott makes the most of a role that seems made
instead for fellow-Scotsman Robert Carlyle, a fun-loving guy
when he's with his main squeeze at the racetrack but not at
all pleased when faced with his competitor for the gal and the
virus gun as well.  Cruise and Newton try to make like Pierce
Brosnan and Sophie Marceau but neither has the needed
panache for the romantic bits and in fact the adorable
Thandie Newton looks more like someone who's cutting
classes at UCLA Berkeley than a sophisticated jewel thief
who can pick a lock in seconds with a couple of sharp
instruments.
   The flamenco scenes are the best part of this escapist
excursion but we are privy to just enough foot stomping to
tease us and encourage us to travel to Spain rather than
Australia when school's out.

Tom Cruise is back as super secret agent Ethan Hunt who must save the world - 
not from nuclear war or
terrorists - but from a lethal man-made virus. An original idea to be sure, 
but the execution of the story is
not. Instead of being too confusing like the last time, this time it's almost 
too simple and certain key plot
points and sequences are waaaaaay over the top and unbelievable. Action 
filmmaker John Woo certainly
puts a lot more energy into this film than Brian De Palma did in 1996. We can 
really buy Cruise as a genuine
action performer (the long, drawn-out fight scene at the end is proof of 
this). 
Whatever you're expecting this film to be will, it WILL be, so enjoy the 
ride.

     The new "Mission: IMpossible" film is out for early summer
audiences.  It will have stiff box office competition from Disney's
current DINOSAUR which offers material that will appeal to adults.
     Once again we have a "Mission: Impossible" movie without a
"Mission Impossible" plot.   What is a "Mission: Impossible" plot?
It is like a jigsaw puzzle.  Through most of the plot you see the
pieces being fit together, but you have no idea what they build.
Suddenly toward the end you go through an "Ah-ha!" experience when
you understand what it is all for.  Then you see what you built do
its thing.  Maybe doing its thing is to make some banana republic
would-be Hitler suddenly appear to have been stealing from the
country's treasury.  It is a spy film powered by gray cells instead
of testosterone.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 is as clueless as its
predecessor what its title claims it to be.  It is like me saying I
am going to write great romantic sonnets just like Shakespeare, but
I am going to write them in four lines.
     Instead of a "Mission: Impossible" plot it has something that
might have worked as a James Bond script.  And evens so, it would
have been a Bond script a little heavy on chases and fights.  For
too much of the screen time Cruise is just showing off for the
camera.  Cruise is trying to be the Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., of our
generation.  He wants to be dashing and handsome and superb at any
number of sports.  This film is too intent on glamorizing Cruise.
     As the story opens we have a scientist in Sydney, Australia,
who had developed a great anti-virus.  And to prove the anti-virus
works he has also developed a great deadly virus for his anti-virus
to counter.  (Yes, that's what he did.)  Now he wants to take the
virus and the anti-virus to the CDC in Atlanta so he injects himself
with the deadly virus.  The deadly strain will be benign for exactly
20 hours, then it will attack him like Ebola.  Our brilliant
scientist wants to get to Atlanta and inject himself with the anti-
virus and not become the Patient Zero of a virus that could destroy
the world.  And what does he do to be sure to get to Atlanta in
time?  He boards a commercial air flight.  (Is this making sense to
you?)  But there are baddies who will stop at nothing to get the
virus and anti-virus.  On the commercial plane the pilot happens to
be one of the baddies' gang.  (However did they manage that?  They
didn't even know what plane he would be taking.)  The baddies, led
by Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), seize the biological agents and
escape the plane, leaving it to crash.
     The Impossible Mission Force has to call in the vacationing
Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) who is having fun by climbing
about half a mile up a sheer rock face without benefit of equipment.
The IMF brings in Ethan and tells him to pick two team members as
well as recruit a third, one a beautiful jewel thief named Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  (With a name like Nordoff-Hall one
wonders if there was a bounty on her head.)  In the best traditions
of Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS, she is asked to go not just under cover
but also between the sheets with former lover Ambrose.
     The film stars Tom Cruise as the lead agent of the IMF.
Thandie Newton is a new face and a different one, but she does not
have enough to do on the screen.  Tom Cruise plays the athletic
miracle man.  In an unbilled role, Anthony Hopkins is around to give
Cruise his orders.  Tom Cruise plays the great lover secret agent.
Dougray Scott is a little lackluster for the villain, but perhaps a
lackluster villain is more realistic.  Tom Cruise is there as the
quick-thinking super-agent.  The Impossible Mission team also has
the talented Ving Rhames returning as Luther Stickell.  He gets to
ride a helicopter and shoot a gun.  Rounding out the crack team of
four agents was some dude with a thin moustache and beard.  I don't
remember if he did anything or had any speaking lines.  I seem to
remember he flew the helicopter.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 also
features Tom Cruise.
     MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 was badly in need of another script re-
write, particularly by someone who was a fan of the original series.
John Woo keeps the action coming, but not the intelligence.  And Woo
is not able to make the action scenes believable or enjoyable.  The
climactic fight is as funny as it is contrived.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
2 is more just a Tom Cruise vanity piece than anything else.  I rate
it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.
     I am starting to have a real problem with this whole mask
thing.  The idea seems borrowed from the opening of FROM RUSSIA WITH
LOVE, where it was fresh.  But let us be clear that to masquerade as
someone else with one of these masks requires a lot of preparation
ahead of time.  It cannot be easy to make a mask that would fool
someone into thinking they were seeing someone they knew when it was
really someone else.  The voice disguise would also take a
tremendous amount of preparation.  Probably neither could be done
without the cooperation of the person who is going to be
impersonated.  Further, people recognize each other by more than
scent, word-choice, accent, memories, and dozens of other
parameters.  The original series used impersonation very, very
sparingly giving the person a lot of preparation time and even then
it was really a credibility stretcher.  You do not just attack a
building with a back-pocket full of these impersonation masks ready
to use.  In addition dramatically it is a poor idea.  It distracts
the audience making them constantly wonder if they really know who
they are looking at or not.  The script uses it entirely too
frequently, whenever the writer wants to throw the audience a cheap
and easy curve ball.

Mission: Impossible 2 opens with a thrilling plane crash that employs the 
classic use of masks from the television show and last movie. It gave me high 
hopes for a thrilling sequel, but when the movie approached its conclusion, I 
realized it had cheated me out of any real human emotion. The occasional, 
"That was cool!" escaped my lips, but as the film droned on, even those got 
fewer and farther in between. This is the problem at the core of this 
mission. The characters are virtually cardboard cutouts with the amazing 
ability to walk, talk, develop toned muscles, and wear outfits with maximum 
cleavage. They're like those cardboard standups you find at party stores of 
Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, and their reactions are just the same. 
Our hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), gets assigned to stop a virus that causes 
rapid cell destruction, killing anyone injected with it after twenty hours. 
He must get thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton, little known to most, unless you 
saw Beloved or Besieged) to join the impossible team. Within fifteen minutes 
of the movie's running time the two have already slept together. He woos Nyah 
(no pun intended) with lines like, "Damn you're beautiful." The team, which 
also includes Luther Stickell, Ving Rhames's character from the last movie, 
must stop the virus from getting into the hands of evil agent Ambrose 
(Dougray Scott). Ambrose wants to buy stock in the company with virus's 
antidote. Then he would cause an outbreak of the disease, making his stock 
skyrocket to millions of dollars. The commercials for this movie should have 
foreshadowed the long and usually bloody action scenes that follow. All of 
these scenes involve Tom and his bulging muscles with Thandie looking 
doe-eyed, helpless, and dependent on Tom for her every need and desire. Also 
popping up for a couple of scenes is Anthony Hopkins who I think is just 
starting to get pretty darn annoying.
While the above plot outline may not sound complex, the plot the movie 
presents you with is. Like too many action and horror movies, the characters 
grasp things too quickly as if someone were explaining to them what had just 
happened, and how to fix it. Often, this loses the audience. A couple of 
times in the movie, a Russian doctor tells Hunt that their situation isn't 
that complicated. All I was thinking about shouting back to the screen was, 
"Yes! It is!" Other things I contemplated shouting mainly involved the 
stupidity of the characters and the cheesy dialogue uttered. Another problem 
with this sequel (and to a lesser degree the previous film) is that it really 
has nothing to do with the original Mission: Impossible television show. I 
watched a couple of old episodes of the program after seeing this movie, and 
I couldn't find any resemblance between the two at all. This is basically a 
big stupid action movie operating under the show's name, music, and mask use. 
The masks are overdone as well, to the point where they just get too 
predictable. Also missing is the use of cool, complicated gadgets. The team 
uses a variety of high tech devices like digital cameras and GPS tracking 
systems. Both of which got introduced at least two years ago and have already 
become integrated into the more techno savvy homes in America. Did the team 
lose the pack of exploding gum? 
To be honest, Mission: Impossible 2 isn't an entirely bad film. There are 
some effective stunts, especially near the end, that obviously originate from 
famous action director John Woo. However, by the time the film got to the 
level of action expected, I was too mindless from the previous proceedings to 
care. It's really disappointing when talented actors like these can't pull a 
movie off. Tom Cruise proved he can still act with his Oscar nomination for 
Magnolia, but that film gets forgotten quickly. Likewise, Thandie Newton, who 
I loved in Besieged, ends up looking like a three year-old baby doll. 
So buy the biggest popcorn available, and get that extra large drink. They'll 
be your only reliable companions through the world of stupidity that is 
Mission: Impossible 2.

"Mission: Impossible II" is not quite the equal of its predecessor -- Brian 
De Palma's 1996 adaptation of the hit TV show was a modern classic in action 
cinema -- but it is an effective spectacle of violence. It could have been 
better. It could also have been worse. Since we get to see Tom Cruise looking 
firm and strong, wearing cool clothes, fighting hard, working out genius 
plans and blowing stuff up, it's good enough for me.
And make no mistake about it, "Mission: Impossible II" is all about Cruise. 
Gone is the teamwork that figured so prominently both on television and in 
the original film: Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is now the centre of 
attention. Even though he's aided by two other secret agents who come out of 
retirement to help him, a woman who injects herself with poison to assist his 
cause, and a boss played by Anthony Hopkins, these people are pushed into the 
background to make the main man look that little bit more heroic.
As pretty much every review of the film has mentioned, this can't help but 
resemble James Bond. De Palma's cool white visuals and playfully complex plot 
have been replaced by exotic locations and a predictable tale of a turncoat 
agent hijacking a deadly chemical virus. Taut structure has been forgone in 
favour of long scenes with a love interest, and a big showdown in the bad 
guy's lair. Set-pieces have been lifted from "Mission: Impossible" such as 
Cruise's dangling from a ceiling to steal information, as well as trademarks 
like the rubber-mask disguises, but nothing that stops "Mission: Impossible 
II" from being a one-man show. 
It's a good one, though. The director, John Woo, is a god among action 
filmmakers. His techniques in movies like "Hard-Boiled" influenced Hollywood, 
then Woo himself moved to the States and started making pictures in which the 
style was a mixture of originality, ripping himself off, and ripping off 
America. You're assured an efficient summer thrill ride when a guy like that 
gets a project like this -- it has a great star, groundbreaking stunts, 
expensive effects, slow-motion, fast motion, repetition... so much showiness 
has been crammed into "Mission: Impossible II" that future film students will 
use it as a reference for action genre trends of the late 1990s.
Where can the "M: I" franchise go from here? I have a clear idea, although 
I'm not so sure that the same can be said for the studio. They have assigned 
Woo to direct a third picture, but I'm not keen on that idea, because it 
probably means we'll get a retread of this one. James Bond is allowed to 
repeat himself, but repeating his repetitions sounds boring as hell. The best 
thing to do is get a different established director to tackle each sequel. 
We've had De Palma and Woo -- wouldn't you like to see the attempts of 
Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas and Ron 
Howard? Keep the series going by making each new instalment a showcase for a 
great artist -- don't let it self-destruct in three movies.

Impossible mission agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back. His IMF
contact, Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins), tracks him down while Hunt is
rock climbing on vacation and tells him to track down former IMF
agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Ambrose has stolen the cure to a
lethal virus from a German scientist; he is now hunting for the virus
itself so he can infect most of the world and sell the cure to the
highest bidder. In order to catch Ambrose, Hunt enlists the aid of a
jewel thief named Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton). Nyah had a
relationship with Ambrose years earlier, and it is believed that he
still has feelings for her. The problem is that Hunt finds himself
falling for Nyah and isn't sure if he can let her go to Ambrose. Hunt
also employs the services of Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames), the
computer geek who assissted him in his last mission, and a
wisecracking Australian named Billy (John Polson). The three find
their way to the outback, where Ambrose has holed up while searching
for the virus which is lethal if not given the antidote after 24
hours.
Think back to 1996, when the first "Mission: Impossible" film hit
theaters.  That movie, despite good performances from both Cruise and
Rhames and an interesting (if somewhat convoluted) plot, was mired
down by a lack of any action and Brian DePalma's direction. "Mission:
Impossible 2" has solved both these problems with one simple solution
- John Woo. Woo is the kind of director who can make a flock of
pigeons look interesting and exciting.  Whatever your opinion might be
of his two previous endeavors, "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow", it's
hard to deny that the man has the ability to film a fantastic looking
action sequence. In "M:I-2" (as it has been advertised) he has created
a few scenes which will no doubt be rememberd by audiences for a long
time. One is a motorcycle chase sequence near the film's end; and the
other is a scene, that audiences will probably remember from the
previews, where Cruise scales a mountain without climbing gear. Both
scenes feature some of the most spectacular stuntwork I've seen this
side of a Jackie Chan movie.
If John Woo has one weakness, it's his inability to pull great
performances out of his actors. Tom Cruise is certainly adequate in
"M:I-2", and at times even a little above that; but he has delivered
much better performances in the past, even in movies like the
otherwise awful and pretentious "Magnolia". Ving Rhames ("Bringing Out
the Dead"), who is a very talented actor, is sadly underused once
again as the amusing computer geek. John Polson ("The Boys") is
relatively unknown to American audiences, having appeared mostly in
Australian films; and he will no doubt remain unkown after being in
this movie for a total of ten minutes or so. Thandie Newton
("Besieged") appears, at first glance, to be present entirely to look
good (and she does so admirably). However, the romantic elements in
"M:I-2" are actually used quite often and effectively. The only
problem is they take a back seat to the action scenes about half way
through the film, and poor Newton more or less vanishes. Last we have
Dougray Scott ("Ever After"), using a very poor imitation Scottish
accent. Oh wait, that really is his accent. Scott looks suitably evil
I suppose, but Woo used much better villains in his last two films:
Travolta and, uh, Travolta. Scott also gets the cheesiest lines, like
"You should have killed me when you had the chance."
Let's face it, you're not going to see "M:I-2" for romance or great
acting.  You want to see this movie for great action scenes and nifty
gadgets, and on both counts it delivers in spades. In fact, "M:I-2" is
the kind of movie that the James Bond films are trying to be, but are
failing at miserably.  I've got an idea: The entire Bond franchise
should be dropped, and we should get an "M:I-3" (I can't believe I'm
asking for a sequel). The action scenes are all excellent in one way
or another, and unlike in DePalma's rather sorry film, they come along
quite often. Woo also adds nice touches to the movie, like fire
reflecting in someone's eyes and dramatic music playing while Ethan
Hunt walks past a flaming doorway in slow motion. The movie's score is
another one of its strong points, being very dramatic and loud during
all the dramatic and loud scenes (which would actually ecompass most
of the film). I'd certainly recommend "M:I-2" to any action fans out
there, though I think there is enough gushy romance to satisfy the non
action fans as well (I could be wrong). The movie runs a touch too
long at 122 minutes.  I give it four out of five stars.

Year: 2000. Starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving 
Rhames, Richard Roxburgh, John Polson, Brendan Gleeson, Rade Serbedzija, 
Anthony Hopkins. Written by Ronald D. Moore & Brannon Braga (story) and 
Robert Towne (screenplay). Directed by John Woo. Rated PG-13.
Now here's a curious beast: A film that's equal parts tedious and 
exhilarating, partially absorbed in its own self-importance, but also 
possessing moments of pure, unpretentious exuberance. That's what 
happens when an acclaimed action director (John Woo) meets crass 
Hollywood commercialism (personified by *producer* Tom Cruise). 
"Mission: Impossible 2" bogs itself down as a star vehicle and glamour 
project, but succeeds when egos get out of the way and allow Woo to work 
his special kind of magic. It's enjoyable once it gets to the good 
stuff, but the good stuff only takes up about half of the running time.
Cruise returns in his role as Ethan Hunt, super-secret agent for the 
mysterious IMF agency. He's called in to deal with a new crisis: Sean 
Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a former IMF operative, is attempting to steal 
both a new deadly virus and its only known cure. After releasing the 
virus to the public, he will make millions by investing in the only 
company producing the antidote. The plan is for Hunt to recruit one of 
Ambrose's old flames, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), professional 
thief and sexy love interest, to spy on the disgruntled former employee. 
Unfortunately, Hunt has fallen into a romantic relationship with Nyah, 
and is therefore reluctant to send her into dangerous situations.
Most of the setup is fairly laborious, with an exciting opening scene 
aboard a plane giving way to long, dull passages of exposition and a 
tedious romantic dalliance for Cruise and Newton. You can see the 
problems coming quickly: The script has been written in just such a way 
so that even the biggest idiot in the house will be able to understand 
what's going on. That means every time something is *shown* to us, it 
must also be *told* to us. I don't understand why this had to be done; 
Woo is a good enough director to indicate things to the audience. We 
don't need a shot of Newton entering a house and then a character 
saying, "She's in the house now."
The romantic relationship is set up in a ridiculous slow-motion car 
chase scene: They hate each other, get into a car crash, and then sleep 
with each other-just your standard action movie logic. I didn't find the 
romance at all credible, despite Woo's best efforts to spice up the 
proceedings. (I did like the scene with Cruise and Newton gazing at each 
other through the dress of a salsa dancer.) Then after Cruise gets some 
booty, the movie shuttles Newton off into support mode, revealing that 
all her thief skills won't be necessary; she's just supposed to be a 
front for the main man. You can tell this was Cruise's pet project 
because other characters are dashed off every time Tom wants to preen. 
Ving Rhames and Richard Roxburgh are brought in as Hunt's presumably 
skilled associates, then mainly stand around giving reasons why they 
can't help him at the crucial moment. That's too bad, because I wanted 
to see more of these guys. They're interesting characters; why not give 
them more screen time? Ms. Newton, meanwhile, is an absolutely gorgeous 
woman with tremendous screen presence and a lovely 
can't-quite-tell-what-race-she-is look that can't be manufactured. But 
she disappears for long stretches while Cruise shows off his pecs and 
flicks his hair. Again, too bad.
That's not to say there isn't fun stuff. There's fun stuff. The ending 
motorcycle chase scene is fun. The spycraft stuff, with earpieces, 
interceptions, and fancy Macintosh laptops, is fun. Slow motion gun 
battles are fun. The movie does come down with Invincible Villain 
Syndrome at the end (a Woo trademark that has always annoyed me), but 
the second half of "Mission: Impossible 2" does seem remarkably less 
tedious than the first-no surprise, because it's at about the halfway 
point that the script gets out of the way and lets Woo's action set 
pieces take over. But it's not only action scenes that have driven 
previous Woo films to success. His most successful American release, 
"Face/Off," had a human interest story at the center of the outrageous 
action. "Mission: Impossible 2," by contrast, barely has time for 
characters. Cruise is too busy posing to play a character, and the other 
actors have been shoved aside to make room for more of his posing. 
Consequently, all hopes for a great, well-rounded film have been dashed 
because of a star's ego.
Ultimately, there's a question one must ask when a film has fun action 
scenes conflicting with a lame script: Is the action good enough to make 
you forget about the other stuff? For me, for this movie, it wasn't. 
Maybe Tom Cruise felt he had the right to indulge himself in 2000 after 
delivering two of the least narcissistic performances of his career in 
1999. In "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Magnolia," Cruise put his ego aside and 
deferred to two directors he respected, Stanley Kubrick and Paul Thomas 
Anderson. Why couldn't he have done the same for John Woo? Where 
Cruise's deference helped elevate his previous two films to artistic 
heights, his egotism has deflated his latest.

I have no personal agenda against action movies in general. If they are 
entertaining, even in a remotely campy manner, then I will not complain. God 
only knows that we should not expect much more in this digital, impersonal 
age. So "Mission: Impossible 2" hardly has much going for it except 
straightforward action scenes to dazzle and numb the brain. Incredibly, the 
film is no fun at all - a never-ending trailer for what might look like a 
cool, sleek action picture that never comes to fruition. It is vapid and 
joyless - two words that should not be associated with thrill rides. 
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the htoshot superspy from the original, is back, 
this time trying to prevent a bland villain, Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from 
buying the antidotes to a deadly virus. From what I gather from the plot, 
this ambitious nut hopes to gain billions by unleashing this virus upon the 
world, and since there will be millions of dying, infected people, he will 
have access to the antidote which he can sell in multitudes. Just sounds like 
another business proposition that Bill Gates should pursue. The only way to 
stop this madman is for Hunt to hire a beautiful jewel thief, Nyah Hall 
(Thandie Newton), to charm the pants off of her former love, Ambrose, so that 
the IMF team can trace his every move. Sounds like an update of Hitchcock's 
classic "Notorious" eh? And I assure you that is where the similarities end, 
since this "M:I 2" possesses not one syllable of greatness from its far 
superior inspiration. 
In fact, this movie is one of the worst sequels in years, embodying 
absolutely nothing that made the first "Mission: Impossible" a passable 
success. It is not witty, funny, exciting or engaging at any given moment. 
For pure excitement, we have an echo of Cruise's famous suspension from a 
ceiling from the original (which echoed the caper "Topkapi"), and a tense, 
believable opening plane crash followed by Cruise dangling 2000 feet up from 
a cliff. Outside of that, director John Woo overdoes the slow-motion 
technique in his action scenes...even using this technique when Cruise and 
Newton make goo-goo eyes at each other. I felt like I was watching a 
commercial for one of those cologne ads.   
Cruise slums and preens with not a trace of his personality coming through - 
he sleepwalks through this movie. Thandie Newton just looks beautiful, a 
shame considering this is the same actress from "Beloved." Ving Rhames barely 
reprises his role from the original, and looks just as bored. The villains 
would barely threaten Adam Sandler. The whole film feels like a bland souffle 
- it is sour and mechanical. Woo does nothing to enliven the proceedings - he 
is on automatic air pilot with dozens of shots of motorcycles, kicks, flips 
in the air, gunfire, oh, and a dove (another Woo trademark). None of this is 
remotely close to his purely visceral and intoxicating "Face/Off." 
Apparently, Tom Cruise fans want him to do more action-oriented/romantic 
comedy fare, and less of his exalting turns in offbeat films such as 
"Magnolia." Perhaps this was just a ride to the bank for Cruise, and now he 
can pursue more challenging roles. My recommended mission, should you choose 
to accept it, is to avoid this movie at all costs.

filmcritic.com presents TWO reviews from staff members James Brundage
and Max Messier.
You can find the reviews with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/f4f3233798557e33882568e800788faa?OpenDocument
Editor's Note: Rarely have to so divergent reviews for one movie crossed
my desk on the same day.  To wit, we present a unique experience for
filmcritic.com -- something of a "He Said, He Said" -- two looks at
Mission: Impossible 2, from two of our most vocal critics. -CN
 John Woo is back in the saddle again.  After turning out useless
Hollywood drivel from emigration up until Face/Off, enjoyable Hollywood
drivel with Face/Off, and intelligent and enjoyable Canadian drivel in
Once a Thief, John Woo has finally reestablished himself as a
grandmaster of the romantic action movie.
 I say this having just watched, for about the last 12 hours straight,
every John Woo film since Hard Boiled, plus the first Mission:
Impossible to boot.  And, having just sat through 12 hours of John Woo
material, I can say without a doubt that M: I-2 is not only proof that
John Woo is back in the saddle, it is also the best English-language
action movie he has churned out to date.
 Mission: Impossible 2 (or M:I-2 for short), probably this summer's
most-anticipated flick, is an entirely different animal from its
predecessor.  Mission: Impossible was your standard espionage flick
(better directed and told in a slightly Hitchcockian style, but still
your standard espionage flick) with a few nice capers and a very
impressive action scene thrown in.  Story-wise, everything was par for
the course.  We even had the obligatory `break into the unbreakable
place' sequence.  M: I-2, on the other hand, is a whole different
animal.
 In M:I-2, rogue agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) steals all of the
cure to a superflu known as Chimera as well as a sample of the virus.
Like any modern-day bad guy, Ambrose is a capitalist and is planning to
sell the cure to the highest bidder after he has unleashed Chimera upon
the world.  And, of course, it falls upon the IMF to stop him.  Heading
up the team is Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise); joining him are agents Luther
Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird (John Polson) and, per the
instructions given in a cameo by Anthony Hopkins, the final member of
the team must be Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), a professional thief who
Ethan must recruit.
 M: I-2 is an action movie, an espionage flick, a terrorist flick, a
kung fu movie, and a romance all rolled into one.  But instead of
botching it by doing too many things at once), M: I-2 juggles all of its
balls in the air and never even gets close to dropping one.  This might
be because master craftsman screenwriter Robert Towne (Chinatown) wrote
the script.  Then again, it might be because John Woo is such a damn
good director.
The one thing M:I-2 is not, however, is a mystery.  You may find the
most impressive action sequences of 2000 in M:I-2¸ but you're not
getting much in the way of plot twists.  If you are in suspense, waiting
for a particular blow-your-mind plot twist, it is because you expect
M:I-2 to be even remotely like the original Mission: Impossible, which
it is not.  M: I-2 is a much more energetic film.  It is strengthened by
bringing a stylistically brilliant director as John Woo into the game.
Woo uses slow motion, fire, birds (his perennial favorite), incredible
backgrounds everything in the book to suck an audience in and keep them
holding their breath.  Even when watching an otherwise dull
conversation, Woo keeps us right on the edge of our seats, waiting for
the next big bang.  Hiring Woo over having Brian De Palma to direct is
one of the smartest moves Cruise has ever made as a producer, if only
because De Palma favors old style, more stagnant camerawork whereas Woo
uses the camera to make all of the motion in the film fluid.
 The acting may not win any Academy awards, but each actor does his job
well enough.  Hans Zimmer's impressive Latin score (a far cry from the
normal percussion-laden and instantly recognizable action flick score
that he uses on just about every Jerry Bruckheimer production) adds to
the tension, and the Limp Bizkit take on the `Mission: Impossible' theme
is more suited for the genre than the prior one.  Robert Towne serves up
snappy dialogue, a good plot, and imaginative sequences for us, and
Jeffrey Kimball handles the cameras damn near perfectly.
 So, you might ask, what is my gripe?  Well, it would have to be the
birds.  Ever since the shootout in the bird teahouse at the beginning of
Hard Boiled, Woo has loved things that fly and aren't made out of lead.
Birds make many appearances here way too many.  There are a few moments
when having birds present makes sense, but their presence in the number
of scenes that they are there (about half of the suspense scenes) makes
you feel like Woo is still grappling with his urge to be an experimental
director.
 But hey, if I go to an action movie that kicks this much ass with a
PG-13 rating, keeps me glued to my chair through 2 hours, twenty
minutes, and 32 ounces of coke, then he can put as many damn birds in as
he pleases.
Max Messier, the flabbergasted critic:
I used to love the delicacies that are offered during the summer movie
season.  We would get generous portions of turkey action films fat with
production budgets, sickly sweet comedy yams starring over-paid
television stars, comic-book adaptations tasting like stuffing from
Boston Market, and independent films that fill the belly like Momma's
honey rolls you fight your grandfather and cousins over.
Those days are over.  Since the launch of the 2000 summer movie season,
everything that the studios have put on the dinner table since the
beginning of May has stunk and made me sick to my stomach.
The biggest turkey so far has to be Mission: Impossible 2.  (Mind you, I
don't count the bloated corpse of Battlefield Earth -- that deserves its
own section of hell.)  A hodgepodge of misguided direction, pathetic
acting, grade school visual effects, unbelievable action scenes, and
Melrose Place-schooled scriptwriting, Mission: Impossible 2 would have
been passable as an action movie, only there isn't any decent action in
it.
I won't go into the pedestrian, stomach-turning plot, which James
described above.  The main problem with M:I-2 is that the writing team
of Ronald D. Moore, Brannon Braga, and Robert Towne have concocted such
an unoriginal and trite piece of storytelling.  It's a damn shame
because both Moore and Braga wrote Star Trek: First Contact and Star
Trek: Generations and Robert Towne wrote Chinatown.  Mission: Impossible
was an incredible TV show that incorporated unique story lines, amazing
character interactions, and some great villains.  It ranks up there with
The A-Team in my book. The first Mission: Impossible film was a decent
effort that just lingered too long like a teenage boy on his first date.
But M:I-2 represents a blatant rip-off of the James Bond films.  It
completely removes the element of teamwork and cohesiveness needed to
successfully complete the missions and replaces it with a loose cannon,
a brooding ladies' man who beds the female lead within ten minutes of
meeting her.  It's also a shame that Ving Rhames is reduced to playing a
monkey punching buttons on a laptop with the Mission: Impossible logo as
wallpaper.
The main question I think everyone will want to ask is: What the hell
has happened to John Woo!?  Every since he started working in America,
his films have been complete shit.  Even the opening scene of Ethan Hunt
climbing a rock face with sweeping helicopter camera shots makes me
think, Am I watching Cliffhanger 2?  Renny Harlin, get on the phone and
call your lawyer.
That said, all of your traditional Woo-isms are here: The slow-motion
shots, the children, the pigeons, religious figures, people flying
around with guns firing.  The only problem is that Woo is using the same
stuff he has used since The Killer in 1989. Nothing seems original at
all.  He is starting to remind me of the late, great Sam Peckinpah: A
good, solid director who lost his way and his ambition toward the end of
his career.  Mr. Woo, get out a piece of paper, write a good script, and
give Chow Yun-Fat a call.
M:I-2 is an utter disappointment and a delusion of a film.  Stay away --
far away.

 Even though it grossed about $400 million worldwide, has anyone really
been waiting anxiously for four years for a sequel to "Mission:
Impossible"? How many people do you know who really loved (much less
understood) that slick, cold and mostly forgettable movie?
 Apparently Tom Cruise did, and when it comes to getting films produced,
you don't need much more of a supporter than that. Perhaps, after
spending most of the late 90s exercising his acting muscles in such
weighty fare as "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Magnolia" he's been yearning for
the day when he can show up on the set, throw on a black leather jacket,
jump on a motorcycle, ride like the wind and forget all about digging
deep within his psyche to find the right emotion. "Besides," he might
rationalize, "I didn't get the Oscar for 'Magnolia,' and my fans
complained there weren't any explosions in 'Eyes Wide Shut,' so why not
give the people what they want?"
 If pyrotechnics and chases are all it takes to satisfy a summer movie
audience, no one can accuse "Mission: Impossible II" -- or "M: I-2," as
the press materials call it -- of shortchanging its viewers. There's
even a smattering of James Bond-style high-tech spy wizardry thrown in,
including a tracking device implanted in the body that can send your
position anywhere on earth to a satellite that zaps the information back
to a computer, and a variety of extraordinarily realistic masks that can
help heroes masquerade as villains and vice versa.
 Since "M: I-2" is directed by John Woo ("Face-Off," "The Killer"), it
also includes several grandiose gun battles, almost all of which are
slowed down to emphasize, Woo's followers will say, their balletic
qualities. To the masses, however, the movie's continual use of
slow-motion will probably be unintentionally funny at first, then just
plain irritating. Unfortunately for Woo, American directors have ripped
off his moves so many times now (most notably in "The Matrix," which
managed both to steal them and improve upon them) it seems as if the old
master is picking his own pocket.
 Flawed as it is, "M: I-2" is still a major improvement over the
original "Mission," which Brian DePalma seemed to direct on auto-pilot.
For starters, it's got a clearly defined plot line; the original was so
unnecessarily complicated it would have taken flow charts and a slide
show to explain.
 Robert Towne, who wrote both films, borrows heavily from Alfred
Hitchcock's 1946 masterpiece "Notorious," as Cruise's super-agent Ethan
Hunt must send the woman he loves -- in this case, an exotic-looking cat
burglar named Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) -- into the arms of
evil in order to get the information he needs to save the world. In
"Notorious," Cary Grant was trying to expose Nazis; here, Hunt has to
locate the lethal Chimera virus, which devours its victims from the
inside out in record time. So the dutiful Nyah beds down with her old
boyfriend Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a wealthy, wicked entrepreneur
who'd like to infect all of Australia with Chimera, then put the cure on
the market at an inflated price. Supervillains these days don't want
ransom money -- they want stock options in bio-tech firms.
 In contrast to most of today's crash-and-smash epics, which can't go
more than five minutes without dropping a one-liner, "M: I-2" maintains
a straight face, even when its characters are doing fairly ridiculous
things. When the funniest guy in the movie is Anthony Hopkins (who shows
up at the beginning and the end of the story as Hunt's boss), you know
you're watching a serious-minded film.
 Disappointingly, "M: I-2" brings back Ving Rhames as Hunt's former
partner Luther Stickell, then keeps him on the bench, plopping him in
front of a computer screen or at the controls of a helicopter instead of
letting him in on the action. That territory is reserved for Cruise and
Cruise alone, and the star does a more than capable job of handling his
stunts, including a final knife fight that, while drawn-out in the same
way as Woo's overblown finale in "Face-Off," generates at least one
major shock that's sure to have everyone gasping simultaneously.
 Cruise comes up startlingly short, however, in his scenes with Newton.
Although the story is built around their romance, there's nothing
exciting going on between them, and even when Towne follows his
"Notorious" blueprint right down to the scene in which our heroine
poisons herself in the name of duty, Hunt seems only moderately
distressed. Poor Nyah would have gotten a much warmer reception from
Cary Grant. James Sanford

 Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Tom Cruise,
Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins. Story by
Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga. Screenplay by Robert Towne. Directed
by John Woo.
 "Mission: Impossible 2" is really two movies in one.
 The first is an action-packed thriller complete with outlandish
students, flying bullets and Hong Kong-style martial arts encounters.
 The second is a love story borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's
"Notorious," in which the hero's lover is asked literally to sleep with
the enemy.
 Somehow legendary screenwriter Robert Towne ("Chinatown") - adapting a
story written by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga - and director John
Woo ("Face/Off") are able to merge these two in a seamless outing that
will leave audiences gasping.
 "Mission: Impossible 2" is a critic-proof movie. No matter how many
flaws, shortcomings or nitpicks I can point out, people are going to
ignore them and flock to this film.
 And, honestly, there is no reason why they shouldn't.
 "M:I2" is everything you want a summer movie to be: visually arresting,
an easy-to-follow plot, tons of pyrotechnics and two gorgeous stars.
 One is Tom Cruise, reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. The other is
Thandie Newton, one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen
today.
 Their scenes together smolder with sexual chemistry.
 The film's plot centers around a deadly virus supposedly held by a
renegade IMF agent named Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Hunt's mission,
which he accepts, of course, is to retrieve the virus as well as its
cure.
 To do this he is told to recruit Nyah Hall (Newton), Ambrose's former
love interest. Nyah also happens to be a professional thief.
 The attraction between Nyah and Hunt is instantaneous as they first
meet in Seville, Spain, with the throbbing beat of flamenco music heard
in the background.
 As is his custom, Woo uses many slow-motion shots and close-ups. He is
especially fond of extreme close-ups of Newton, who is very easy to look
at.
 Cruise looks buff and sculpted. His babyish face is beginning to take
on some character giving him a semi-rugged countenance that suits him.
 Scott, who played Prince Henry in "Ever After," does not seem that
formidable a foe. He appears a bit too soft, too vulnerable to be an
out-and-out, over-the-top villain.
 Also in the cast is Ving Rhames again playing computer genius Luther
Stickell, and Anthony Hopkins in a cameo as Hunt's boss.
 "M:I2" is a visual treat. Set pieces include a car chase involving Nyah
and Ethan as well as a hair-raising motorcycle duel between Hunt and
Ambrose. "M:I2" is stylish, stunning and loud.
 The musical score by Hans Zimmer alternates from a pounding action
motif to a romantic flamenco love theme for the scenes between Ethan and
Nyah.
 The movie's main drawback is that it's not really "Mission: Impossible"
as created by Bruce Geller. The TV series emphasized brain over brawn.
The IMF team would play mind games, use masks, illusions, create train
rides, earthquakes, all to confuse and bedevil their target into
surrendering that week's McGuffin.
 "M:I2" plays more like a James Bond outing. True, both Hunt and Ambrose
use masks to disguise themselves to learn information, but that is
basically the only tip of the hat to the TV series.
 Too many gunbattles and too many hand-to-hand encounters gives "M:I2"
the feel of encroaching into 007 territory.
 However, that aside, "Mission: Impossible 2" is an extremely
entertaining vehicle, a testosterone-filled escape. It's a slam-bang way
to begin the summer.

Directed by John Woo. Screenplay by Robert Towne, from a story by Brannon
Braga and Robert D Moore, based on the television series by Bruce Geller.
Starring Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, Thandie Newton. Running time: 125
minutes. Rated PG for mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 26th,
2000.
When the original movie version of "Mission: Impossible" was released in 
1996, there was little doubt that a sequel would soon follow. The film 
provided the perfect framework for a long-running franchise in the form 
of the international espionage agency known as the Impossible Missions 
Force. Not only did the use of this multi-purpose organization provide 
reasonable breadth of storytelling, but it meant future films weren't 
contingent on a recurring cast. Sequels could always use a different IMF 
if need be. Even the star, Tom Cruise, could be replaced in a manner 
rather more palatable than, say, the revolving door Batmans of the past 
decade.
Of course, for "Mission: Impossible 2", only the first option has been 
employed. Cruise does indeed return to reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, 
one of the IMF's top agents. Hunt, once again, is a cool, poised man of 
action, possessing a seemingly endless array of skills. But unlike the 
first "Mission: Impossible", which cast Hunt in the role of a desperate 
agent abandoned by his organization, little is really done with Cruise's 
character in this sequel. Character development is slim to none, and a 
romance with a fellow agent feels lifted out of a James Bond picture. 
There is an unsatisfying sense of stagnation to Ethan in "MI2"; it's 
almost as if scriptwriter Robert Towne is taking a page from the "Mission:
Impossible" TV series in limiting Hunt's evolution. The problem is that 
this is a feature film, not a television programme. It's fine for TV 
characters to develop slowly, because with twenty-two episodes a year 
they have the time. A movie franchise which only churns out a new 
installment every few years cannot afford the same luxury.
The same problem plagues the other holdover from the first film, Luther 
Stickell (Ving Rhames). Stickell was engaging in "Mission: Impossible"; 
here he's shoehorned into the background, often isolated even from the 
other IMF agents. Stickell could just as easily have been replaced with a 
totally new character without damaging the film, and as a result his 
return here feels almost token. The third member of this version of 
Hunt's team, Billy Baird (John Polson) is similarly faceless; even Emilio 
Estevez's short-lived agent in the first film was more interesting than 
this guy.
The same cannot quite be said of the last of our heroes, Nyah Hall 
(Thandie Newton). A world-class thief, we first encounter Nyah in action 
trying to steal a valuable necklace, and it makes for one of the movie's 
most watchable scenes. Nyah is a promising character -- neither a typical 
damsel-in-distress nor some kind of uber-confident goddess. 
Unfortunately, that potential gets lost in the movie's second half, in 
which Newton has far less screen time. It's also regrettable that Nyah's 
role in the proceedings means that she rarely gets to demonstrate her 
skills; the script mostly just calls for her to stand around and look 
vaguely nervous. Nonetheless, I would enjoy seeing the character return, 
in a more proactive role, in future "Mission: Impossible" films.
This time around, the team has been assembled to investigate the 
disappearance of the mysterious genetically-engineered Chimera virus and 
its antidote, Bellorophon. These have been stolen by a rogue IMF agent 
named Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott, who does a good job of acting evil but 
can conjure no other personality traits from the character) posing as 
Hunt himself. Ambrose and his goons intend to auction off Chimera and 
Bellorophon to the highest bidder. New IMF recruit Nyah is also Ambrose's 
former lover, putting her in a unique position to get close to him and 
give Hunt and his team a chance to reclaim the stolen goods.
The plot of the original "Mission: Impossible" was criticised by some for 
being too labyrinthine, although I enjoyed the complexity and intrigue it 
offered. The sequel goes too far the other way. This is all standard spy 
stuff -- viruses, high-stakes auctions, jilted ex-lovers -- and the 
"rogue agent" subplot has been overused of late, in everything from 
"GoldenEye" to, indeed, the first "Mission: Impossible"!
And this isn't the only element of the movie that feels lifted from its 
predecessor. Remember that terrific scene with Tom Cruise dangling inches 
above a pressure-sensitive floor? Well, something similar occurs here, 
albeit with none of the tension or flair of the original. Indeed, "MI2" 
is sadly lacking in invention and suspense, with many of the action 
scenes being just routine material. There is little of the twisting and 
turning which characterised the first film. There, when a character's 
secrets were revealed they were astounding; here, they're easily predicted.
It is fortunate, then, that "Mission: Impossible 2" has renowned director 
John Woo at its helm. Woo knows how to inject some much-needed 
adrenaline into the picture, employing some creative action shots which 
only slightly overuse slow-motion effects. Even Woo cannot save the 
tedious and overlong middle third of the movie. But he is in fine form 
during the closing half hour, pumping up the tempo with an entertaining 
motorcycle chase and a heart-pounding hand-to-hand duel between Hunt and 
Ambrose. Also an asset is a fine multifaceted score by Hans Zimmer.
But ultimately, it's hard to shake the feeling that "Mission: Impossible 
2" is mostly an exercise in sound and fury. And while this is certainly 
nothing new for a summer blockbuster, I at least demand something with a 
bit of originality for my entertainment dollar. "MI2" just doesn't offer 
that; it seems content to just be adequate, relying on the memory of the 
superior first movie (and of course Cruise's star power) to fill the seats.
"MI2" isn't a bad film, but it is a poor sibling to the first "Mission: 
Impossible". That movie was fun consistently, this one only in flashes. I 
would not be dismayed if a third film in the series were to go into 
production. But I hope any such project will strive to bring some 
freshness and invention to the franchise. With "Mission: Impossible 2", 
complacency has already set in.

What a way to kick off the summer of 2000! If you're a Hard Boiled Movie 
Guide reader, it'll be no surprise to you that I enjoyed Mission: 
Impossible 2 because of my heavy bias towards movies made by John Woo. So, 
to get this out of the way early: Don't Miss Mission: Impossible 2. Now, if 
you want the details, read on.
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) can be likened to being the American version of 
James Bond. If you thought the first film was convoluted and confusing, 
you're not the only one. After watching it a few times, I was finally able 
to string most of it together. If you like that kind of spy-versus-spy type 
movie, M:I-2 will disappoint you. But, if you're looking for a cohesive 
story that is punctuated by some eye-popping pyrotechnics and shoot-outs, 
you're in for a treat.
The story of M:I-2 is pure and simple. A rogue IMF Agent, Sean Ambrose 
(Dougray Scott), has stolen a deadly virus. It is up to Hunt and his 
associates to track down Ambrose and retrieve the virus before it is 
unleashed to the world. There are twists and turns all through the film, 
most of them using the (overused) masked agent trick. Assisting Hunt this 
time around are Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie 
Newton), and Billy Baird (John Polson). Doing a short and sweet cameo is 
Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's unnamed new boss.
As far as the story goes, it's enough to keep a summer audience's attention 
without being overbearing. The one drawback was the predictability of the 
script, and again the overuse of the whole masked agent bit. There is one 
real audience pleasing twist in the film. This twist involves Hunt planning 
a break-in while Ambrose figures out Hunt's plans. A brilliant cutting of 
this sequence makes the sequence superb.
For me writing a review of a John Woo film is both easy and difficult. It 
is easy because all of his films entertain me, but difficult because I tend 
to rattle on like an uncontrollable fan who can't look past the name John 
Woo. The action in M:I-2 is top-notch. Woo pulls out all stops with the 
action, but the action seems to be all crammed into the end of the film, 
making the film feel heavy in the beginning with exposition and heavy at 
the end with action. The balance falls in the sense of wonder and grandeur 
that Woo puts into the film. For instance, Woo shoots a flamenco sequence 
early in the film with such flair that it stands out as more than just a 
dance sequence.
As for the actors, we're not going to a summer movie to see Oscar-caliber 
acting, and the cast knows that. All the members do a good job with their 
parts, but don't expect Tom Cruise to be putting in anything but his silly 
grin. Also take into account that M:I-2 is the first film in which Cruise 
fires a gun onscreen. Worth mentioning is Thandie Newton who is absolutely 
gorgeous onscreen and steals every scene she is in. Sadly, Ving Rhames and 
John Polson do not get much to do in the film. Rhames is relegated to 
running equipment back and forth, or sitting in a van. Polson has even less 
to do.
Final word on Mission:Impossible 2? Go see it for some summer eye-candy 
fun. Don't Miss Mission:Impossible 2.

Remember MI-1? Tom Cruise hanging from the ceiling while performing all
sorts of spy operations? Yep, that's all I remember too. I wasn't crazy
about MI-1, and am feeling nearly the same about MI-2. Inversely, if you
liked the first, perhaps you'll enjoy the later.
I'm a big Cruise fan and willing to take the heat for it. He's a good actor
and looks great at the end of a string, or tumbling backwards while kicking
the bad guys in the face. In an MI-2 introductory scene, Cruise climbs Utah,
getting that red dirt under his nails. Woo does a fantastic job of putting
it all to the wall with aerial photography. This quietly huge moment is
boosted even higher via a screaming contrast with the previous airplane out
of control opening sequence. This is the scene I will remember from MI-2,
and Cruise doesn't even know his mission yet.
Ambrose (the biggest bad guy) gets a hold of the cure for the nastiest
man-made disease to date, all he needs is the actual virus to infect the
masses, shakedown the head of a pharmaceutical company, invest in the stock
market, then hand over the cure and badabing badaboom, he's a billionaire. A
simple enough plan were it not for Cruise's hand-picked spy team.
Professional thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), the beautiful key player in
his alliance, steals the affections of both Cruise and Ambrose, and that's
no coincidence.
Though, these spies handle the art of science well, there's little chemistry
between Cruise and Newton. However, in perhaps the first "romantic car
chase" ever to grace the screen, the two tango in the dust and gravel of
their spinning convertible sports cars, artistic and elegant - kudos again
to Woo.
And that's it. No major twists, aside from some very nicely simulated
cyber-face changing, but after the first face-lift ... well, you get the
idea.
The dialogue is routine, dipping at times to below average. You know, the
familiar, "Get him!" and "Put a sock in it!" and "Ha, you should have killed
me when you had the chance." Plus, the filmmakers made every effort to
repeat import information for us, dangling there on the edge of insulting.
In fact, the overall production feels like an artfully crafted episode of
the "A-Team." At age ten, I would have been ecstatic over it.
Most of the big action is big; though often popping wheelies into the
ridiculous - it's still fun. Unfortunately, the momentum stalls in-between,
while many presumptions just don't hold water.
Though at times he gets carried away, still true, Woo is cool. This mission
would have been next to impossible without him.

Easily one of the most highly anticipated movies of the summer (for
audiences and yours truly alike), MI2 was filmed in Australia, features the
great-looking Tom Cruise with long hair, Thandie Newton looking extremely
sweet in her biggest role to date, and ex-Wolverine candidate Dougray Scott
as the official "bad guy". Mix all that in with a healthy dose of Mr. John
Woo at the helm, and God knows the trailer makes it look like the
action-adventure kickass movie of the summer. So is it really that good?
Well...
PLOT:
Super-spy Ethan Hunt is once again asked to take part in a virtually
impossible mission featuring the recovery of a deadly new virus and antidote
from a madman bent on unleashing it upon the world.
CRITIQUE:
This movie starts off with a bang, downshifts into some pretty long and
surprisingly tedious exposition, but ultimately regroups and punches you in
the face during its last 30 bone-crunching minutes. Having said that, I was
slightly disappointed in the film, only because the trailer made it seem
like it was going to kick so much ass all over the place. My hopes might've
been set too high in the anticipation of full-blown action, and even more so
because of the superior talents of director Woo in that regard. Overall, the
film was good, but parts leading up to the halfway point just seemed to
uneventfully drag along for some strange reason, with talk of viruses, the
pharmaceutical angle, and ultimately, one too many rubber mask deceptions
(didn't we get enough of these in the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, as well as
FACE/OFF?). And being one of the few people to have actually really liked
the first movie, this one lacked a lot of that cool "spy feel" which I liked
so much in the first. Granted, this film also takes some of its time to
marinate the new "romance" vibe tossed into its cinematic recipe, but I
personally don't go to see John Woo movies in the hopes of finding out more
about the birds and the bees. I want to see action, cool stunts, slo-mo
shots of guns rattling off and an obscene amount of style.
This film definitely delivers on most of those counts, especially the
slo-mos and the proverbial Woo "pigeon scene", but not all in a
well-proportioned manner, in my opinion. The last third of the movie finally
picks up the pace, presenting us with an awesome motorcycle chase scene
which simply has to be seen to be believed, but overall, the pace of the
first half actually had me starting to twitch a little (in a "can we get on
with it already" kinda way). Of course, most of this review sounds negative
only because of my extremely high expectations, so maybe if you go in with
lesser anticipation than I did, you might just really love it. I very much
enjoyed the film's first twenty minutes or so, which included a great
sequence of Tom hanging off the side of a mountain with his little-bittie
fingers, and a pretty darn cool car chase. But the film ultimately crushed
some of my hyperactivity, with a slower, less in-your-face approach during
its next forty-five minutes of set-up. In the end, this film still spends
too much time discussing the plot, which could easily be described in a few
simple words (bad guy has deadly virus, get bad guy before he sets it free
on the world), and not enough time properly dividing up all the action.
I loved both MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and FACE/OFF, both of which I gave 8/10, and
despite this film's few great action scenes, decent acting by most, so-so
story, and captivating soundtrack, I can't help but feel a little
disappointed with thoughts of what-could-have-been. But comparing it to
other films and judging it according to my expectations isn't really fair,
so I will try and get past that and still recommend this film pretty
solidly, despite its leisurely paced build-up and stronger focus on romance.
Whatever you do, don't go into it as I did, expecting one of the most
action-packed movies of the last few years. Enjoy it as a good film
featuring Tommy Cruise, a babe, Ving Rhames sitting in front of a monitor
for two hours, an okay premise and a few over-the-top action sequences. All
in all, I liked it and look forward to a part trois.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Note: Anthony Hopkins has no more than five minutes of screen time in this
entire movie.
Thandie Newton played "Beloved" in the 1998 Oprah Winfrey movie of the same
