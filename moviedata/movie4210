    Some decades ago, I thought that famous actors and TV
stars were not really people like the ones you see every day
on the street and assumed, therefore, that they did not have
the usual needs and wants.  I was puzzled, then, by the
articles that filled the pages in the supermarket tabloids,
particularly the most popular magazine of its time,
"Confidential," which talked incessantly about the marriages
and divorces of Hollywood personalities.  Somehow I believed
that celebrities filled up their lives with their work and had no
time or inclinations for the usual domestic adventures that
most of us took for granted, nor did they use their money for
their own trivial pursuits separate from what they needed for
their careers.  Had I seen "Lucky Numbers" thirty years ago, I
might have given up that image, because in Nora Ephron's
new comedy, scripted by Adam Resnick, a television
personality acclaimed by just about everyone in his area of
Pennsylvania is famous enough, but he is perpetually in debt,
regularly thinking up business schemes to create personal
wealth, and dependent on the pleasures of the bed provided
for him by yet another TV celebrity.
   With "Lucky Numbers," Nora Ephron no longer capitalizes
on her signature efforts such as the airy, romantic, laugh-out-
loud comedy "When Harry Met Sally" and the milder but
captivating "You've Got Mail," nor does she exploit the
quirkiness of her box-office flop "Michael," which showed that
an angel might be scruffy and randy but could still perform
heartwarming miracles during a periodic sojourn to earth. 
Instead, Ephron has dished up an unfunny caper story filled
with sloppy acting by John Travolta, a gruesome script for the
usually whimsical Bill Pullman, and a moronic and repetitive
set of thuggish actions for Michael Rapaport.  Were Tim Roth
not available for the side role of a malefactor's counselor,
"Lucky Numbers" would have been a thoroughly unamusing
yarn.
   If one thing could be said in the picture's favor, the
narrative does show us that some of the most confident,
popular, hale-fellows-well-met that appear on the tube are
thoroughly stupid and self-destructive when not basking in the
limelight of the studios or the adulation of the crowds who
bestow endless praise upon them.  In the role of Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania TV weatherman Russ Richards--who when we
first meet him believes he has everything--John Travolta
heads gleefully from home to his private space in the parking
lot of station WTPA, puts on a show, and is regularly
petitioned for snapshots by his fans who apparently like the
guy's friendly but cartoonish manner while reporting the day's
clime.  In debt for bad investments (currently a large store
selling snowmobiles which languish because of a dearth of
snow), he receives advice from his buddy, Gig (Tim Roth), to
team up on a scam with Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow). 
Crystal, who has a gorgeous body to which she allows
access to both her boss, Dick Simmons (Ed O'Neill) and to
Richards, is responsible for drawing the numbers for
the Pennsylvania lottery on the same network that employs
Richards.  Together, Crystal and Russ concoct a scheme
involving Crystal's dim-witted, asthmatic uncle
Walter (Michael Moore) to fix the drawing so that the six
million dollar jackpot would be awarded to them, but through
a series of mishaps easily avoidable if the perps had half a
brain between them, they are hit upon but a succession of
thugs for a share of the booty.
   When a sometimes amusing script is wrecked by a director
whose sense of comic timing is off, the result is a flat piece of
work that wastes the talent of such notables as Lisa Kudrow
(who displayed her broad range in "The Opposite of Sex" but
who this time around simply mouths obscenities), and
Michael Rapaport (amusing enough when in the hands of
Woody Allen but who now performs as an airheaded thug
who commits mayhem with celebrity baseball bats).  To
nobody's good luck, this picture plays strictly by the numbers. 
Rated R.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

The tagline for this movie reads, "When they put their heads together...
it's a no-brainer."  I'd say that about sums it up, but I feel obliged
to add that this witticism might aptly be suited not only to the film,
but to the entire cast and crew of Lucky Numbers.
This is the story of two lovers.  Well, except that they don't really
love each other, but isn't that always the way?  Russ Richards (John
Travolta) and Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow) are two self-absorbed local
television celebrities looking for a little respect.  And money.  You
see, Richards is more than just a locally renowned weatherman with his
own private booth at Denny's.  He's also a snowmobile dealer.  Or would
be, if only it would snow.
But when the bank forecloses on his dealership, his house of cards
collapses and the only thing that could possibly save him is the state
lottery.  Therefore, at the advice of local gentleman's club owner Gig
(Tim Roth) and with the help of his fair-weather lover Crystal, Russ
sets out rig the drawing in his favor -- and winds up owing favors all
around.
It's amazing how little a collection of some of Hollywood's hottest
stars can accomplish when they really put their minds to it.  This is
one of the finest casts ever brought together for the creation of such a
third-rate film.  Except for Travolta, whose small, whiny voice makes
him delicately suited to only a few grown-up roles, this cast really
shimmers.  Even Friends star Kudrow manages to put a little acting into
it.  Roth, though obviously typecast from his Pulp Fiction limey thug
persona, is clever and endearing as the creepy and conspiratorial club
owner.  And Bill Pullman is subtly hilarious as the sleazy, slack-off
anti-hero cop.
This movie sports some truly funny moments, mostly surrounding the
climax of events, but it's just not enough to carry it off.  The set-up
takes far too long, and most of the story is plainly obvious starting
with the end of scene two, after which time we endure a predictably
shallow slide into the action of the film.
Fundamental to this flick's flaws is the lack of character depth.  Russ
Richards and Crystal Latroy are so primally empty that they never become
interesting.  Not that shallow characters can't be interesting, but
these ones just aren't.  There is no emotional investment in their
plight, no reason to care for them, because they so clearly care nothing
for either themselves or each other.  So we just watch them duly perform
their little antics, stooges in THX.  And when the lights come on, we
have experienced nothing.

Lucky Numbers (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring John Travolta, Lisa
Kudrow, Ed O'Neill, Tim Roth and Michael Rappaport. Written by Adam
Resnick. Directed by Nora Ephron.
 Every town and small city has its Russ Richards. He's the local
ěcelebrity,î the TV anchorman, weatherman or pitchman who everyone knows
and adores.
 Russ Richards is the star celebrity weatherman at a Harrison, Pa., TV
station. And it is his story that is the focus of Lucky Numbers, a broad
and sometime strident comedy about greed and its consequences.
 Set in 1988, Lucky Numbers is loosely based on a real incident from
1980 in which someone tried to fix the daily number drawing in the
Pennsylvania state lottery.
 Screenwriter Adam Resnick and director Nora Ephron have fictionalized
this scandal, creating an almost slapstick style comedy, which moves in
starts and spurts.
 Richards (John Travolta) is the king of Harrisburg. His life, as far as
he is concerned, is a joy. He has his own parking space as well as his
own table at the local Dennyís. Fans, waiters and waitresses fawn over
him.
 However, Richardsí life is about to start that long painful downhill
slide. His snowmobile business is causing him to go broke, costing him
his house and his prized possession  his Jaguar. It seems a warm spell
has gripped Harrisburg so there is no call for snowmobiles during the
winter of '88.
 Richards turns to his friend, Gig (Tim Roth), who gives him several
suggestions none legal  on how to obtain some quick cash.
 The first, an attempted burglary of his dealership, is thwarted but an
overzealous employee.
 Then Gig suggests a way to fix the $6.4 million lottery drawing. This
plan works, but then everyone who knows about the scheme wants a piece
of the action.
 Pretty soon, Russ again owes more than he has.
 And while all this may sound hilarious  and parts are Lucky Numbers has
a mean-spiritedness to it. These people  who also include Lisa Kudrow as
the sluttish lottery number girl and Ed O'Neill as the slimy head of the
TV station  are venal, unethical and greedy.
 None of them are really worth caring about. It is difficult to like or
root for any of them. Even while you laugh, you don't want to see them
succeed.
 As a paean to avarice, Lucky Numbers is a textbook study. It doesnít
rank, though, with a comedy such as Outrageous Fortune. Lucky Numbers it
is too long, too broad and features too many characters and too much
double dealing.
 Travoltaís performance, while rather hammy, is not bad. His Russ
Richards is one of those self-centered, spoiled people who believes
their status entitles them to whatever they want.
 Kudrowís Crystal Latroy is an immoral co-conspirator who uses her body
to get what she wants and what she thinks she deserves.
 Lucky Numbers has several funny moments, but as a whole the film leaves
you dissatisfied. Maybe it is because I don't care about bad things
happening to these unredeemable characters. I think these people all get
what they deserve.
 And I donít like spending two hours dwelling on their flaws and
shortcomings.
 No, Lucky Numbers has its hilarious moments, but overall these people
are not worth anyoneís time.

There's some movies I enjoy even though I know I probably shouldn't and have 
a difficult time trying to explain why I did. "Lucky Numbers" is a perfect 
example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of "Fargo" and every 
movie based on an Elmore Leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me. 
I know I'm in the minority here but let me explain. 
The film takes place in Harrisburg, PA in 1988 during an unseasonably warm 
winter. John Travolta plays the local big-shot TV weatherman who is idolized 
by the townsfolk as if he were John Travolta himself and not the bumbling 
Russ Richards. 
Russ is married to Crystal (Lisa Kudrow), a blonde bimbo if ever there was 
one in the history of cinema. She's a selfish, nasty bitch full of lust and 
desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the 
most intellectually taxing job on the market. Crystal's cheating on Russ with 
their collective boss Dick (Ed O'Neil), the TV station manager. She doesn't 
seem to genuinely like either of them, but it's all she can do in this 
one-horse town. 
Much like "Fargo," this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and 
has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick. He enlists the help of his 
English friend Gig (Tim Roth), the local stripclub owner who tells him how to 
fix the lottery. Along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named, 
accurately, "Dale the Thug" (Michael Rappaport) gets mixed up in the process. 
There's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes 
down. 
I'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it 
continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting. This is a 
farce, which is basically a straightforward, adult-oriented comedy but 
doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should. Where as "Fargo" was 
sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny, "Lucky Numbers" is just 
funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations 
seriously. It's all a big cartoon basically, but it's funny and I can respect 
that. 
Travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable 
character, he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep. He's 
like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to 
kill. Crystal is just the opposite, she's constantly arguing and using 
whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself. Kudrow is perfect 
in this role since she's spent 8 years on TV as the dim-witted Phoebe on 
"Friends." Here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of Phoebe. 
I have to admit I was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot 
unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their 
share of the money. Like "Jackie Brown," (an Elmore Leonard adaption), the 
story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has 
been won illegally. The screenplay does a fine job in balancing the 
characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at 
the same time keep Russ Richards the main focus. More and more characters are 
introduced and since the film has such an iconic, cartoony atmosphere you can 
take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do. 
The ending itself is great. It's surprising and funny and makes you feel 
good. You realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of 
stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart (although many other 
critics might beg to differ). I liked it, and I could see it again - isn't 
that what makes a movie good?

Nora Ephron's "Lucky Numbers" came and went in theaters in the fall of 2000, 
and it's easy to understand why. Excising her usual romantic plotline, Ephron 
(1993's "Sleepless in Seattle") and screenwriter Adam Resnick have made a 
pitch-black, meanspirited comedy that is too infrequently funny, and more 
uneven than it should have been. 
Set in 1988 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, television weatherman Russ Richards 
(John Travolta) is having a terrible winter, thanks to the unusually balmy 
temperatures that have led his snowmobile business threatening to foreclose. 
When his strip-club-owning friend, Gig (Tim Roth), suggests he rig their news 
station's lottery, with the help of the conniving lotto ball girl, Crystal 
(Lisa Kudrow), the scheme is set into motion--with disastrous results.
While certain elements of the picture do intermittently sparkle, including 
two delightfully humorous supporting performances from documentarian Michael 
Moore (as Crystal's asthmatic, masturbating cousin) and Maria Bamford (as a 
ditzy Denny's waitress), and a fun '80s soundtrack, the film is emotionally 
cold and extremely cruel-hearted. Our two protagonists, played by John 
Travolta (2000's "Battlefield Earth") and Lisa Kudrow (2000's "Hanging Up"), 
are both despicable human beings who deserve far worse than they are ever 
afforded throughout, and so we lose interest in their plight.
In the right hands, "Lucky Numbers" could have been the next "Fargo," or a 
funnier "A Simple Plan," but Ephron and Resnick botch the results with little 
to laugh about, and even less to be left in suspense with. It proves to be a 
detached experience that, like Russ and Crystal, isn't much fun at all.
How Does It Look?
Presented in an anamorphic widescreen transfer, the picture quality on the 
"Lucky Numbers" disc is very well orchestrated, if not perfect. While the 
picture is consistently bright and the colors accurately rendered, there was 
a little bit more grain than I expected from a big-budget 2000 movie from 
Paramount Pictures. Blacks levels are good, but often pose a grain problem 
during the nighttime shots, while the daytime scenes come off beautifully, 
thanks in part to the lovely Harrisburg scenery. A strong transfer, but 
misses the mark of being reference quality.
How Does It Sound?
With 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, as well as a separate French track, the movie 
is perfectly clarified from beginning to end, with the notable music gaining 
quite a bit of mileage out of the surround system. 
Special Features?
While not labeled a "Special Edition," "Lucky Numbers" offers up a few 
goodies that bring the DVD's quality up a notch or two. First up is a 
screen-specific audio commentary track by director Nora Ephron. In some 
cases, it is far more entertaining than the film itself. Ephron presents 
herself and her thoughts well, and adds insight into the production. Her 
validity comes into question, however, when she mentions Lisa Kudrow's role 
is the best part for a woman she has ever read. Anyone who sees the movie 
will realize that Kudrow's Crystal is a nasty backstabber, and one-note to 
boot. Not exactly a quality female role, in my book. Also included on the DVD 
is an entertaining, if slight, featurette that incorporates scenes from the 
film with cast and crew interviews. Running just over nine minutes, it is a 
welcome addition to this release. Finally, there is the theatrical trailer 
for you to watch, and consider how it didn't look very good as a 
two-and-a-half-minute advertisement, either.
The Lowdown
The only thing to say about "Lucky Numbers" is that it is an ambitious movie 
that falls flat. As a stand-alone DVD release, it is not recommended, but for 
those that enjoy it, there is much to like in the special features that might 
make it worth a rental, or a buy for the devoted fans of Travolta, Kudrow, or 
Ephron.
Overall: * * 1/2 (out of * * * * ) . . . Recommended with reservations

A few years back, Nora Ephron seemed like one of Hollywood's rising
stars.  She nabbed three Oscar nominations early in her career for
penning a Mike Nichols film (Silkwood) and two Meg Ryan films (When
Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, the latter of which she
directed).  But Ephron's last few projects have practically erased any
of the positive memories she created earlier in her career.
First came You've Got Mail, the ill-conceived remake of The Shop Around
the Corner.  Then Ephron wrote and produced Hanging Up, an irritating
film based on an enjoyable book written by her sister Delia.  Now it's
Lucky Numbers' turn to squander A-list stars in a film that could have
been a lot better in the right hands.
Numbers is set in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the holiday season of
1988.  The film's main character is Russ Richards (John Travolta,
Battlefield Earth), an annoyingly popular television weatherman with his
own parking space at his favorite restaurant (Denny's) for his Jaguar
convertible.  Russ makes good money but squanders it on bad business
investments.  The latest  a snowmobile dealership  is struggling
because of unseasonably warm weather.  When the film opens, we see the
game-show-host wannabe served with foreclosure papers on his huge
suburban home.
When his boss (Ed O'Neill, The Bone Collector) refuses to give him an
advance, Russ turns to Gig (Tim Roth, The Legend of 1900), a strip club
owner who suggests the beleaguered personality fix the Pennsylvania
State Lottery, which picks its numbers from Russ' television station. To
do so, he must enlist the aid of Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow, Hanging
Up), the station's Vanna White-like Lotto girl, to help pull off the
scam.
The first half of Numbers is somewhat promising and well-paced, but the
second half really comes apart at the seams.  There is so much
backstabbing and double-crossing, it's hard to tell up from down.  This
is complicated by the fact that there isn't one sympathetic character in
the film, so the aforementioned backstabbing and double-crossing has
little effect. Even worse is a worthless subplot involving a lazy cop
(Bill Pullman, Brokedown Palace) who may or may not be hot on the trail
of Russ and Crystal.
Travolta looks frightening, even sans the Battlefield Earth makeup and
hair.  If you saw him playing a foppish vampire on Saturday Night Live,
you might not be able to shake the image from your head during Numbers.
He has the same creepy haircut.  Watching Travolta and Roth opposite
each other in several scenes makes it clear that one is a terrific
actor, and the other is just calling in the performance.  Kudrow, who
always seemed to be the smartest member of Friends (The Opposite of Sex,
Clockwatchers, Analyze This) until Ephron got a hold of her, shows off
her impressive rack throughout the film.  It's nice to see her play
something other than a ditz.
Numbers was written by Adam Resnick, who directed Chris Elliott's Cabin
Boy and co-produced his Get a Life television series.  The film is
loosely based on events that occurred on April 24, 1980 at WTAE in
Pittsburgh, where an announcer rigged the Daily Numbers drawing.
Numbers even borrows the line "If you've got it, come and get it; if
not, better luck tomorrow" from the real-life story, which became known
as `The 666 Fix' because of the triple-digit combination of numbers the
crooked drawing produced.

Somebody do me a favor: find Nora Ephron and take her Director's Guild
card away.  And don't forget her Screenwriter's union card; she might
just sneak past an unsuspecting audience again.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Russ Richards (John Travolta), a doofus weatherman at WTPA in Harrisburg
Pennsylvania, is in trouble.  Sure, he has a Jaguar that he parks at his
reserved spot at Denny's "restaurant", and sure, he has a snowmobile
dealership; but when Harrisburg goes through - what, days? - of the
warmest winter on the books and his dealership slowly goes under, Russ
finds himself in need of a quick influx of income.  WTPA station manager
Dick Simmons (Ed O'Neill) won't front Russ the money, so Russ goes to
his friend Gig (Tim Roth) to ask for help.
Gig's first idea, involving a "business associate" by the name of Dale
The Thug (Michael Rapaport), was foiled by Russ' unwitting snowmobile
salesman Larry (Michael Weston); so they come up with Plan B: with the
help of Russ' Lotto Girl girlfriend Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow) and her
wheezing cousin Walter (Michael Moore), they plan to somehow rig the
state lottery so they can win it.  And - you knew this was coming,
dincha? - Wackiness Ensues.
[Man, I'm surprised I made it through that description before my fingers
fell asleep.]
The Upshot:
John Travolta couldn't leave well enough alone when he stunk up the
joint with his ego-driven BATTLEFIELD EARTH wreck, I see.  That wasn't
punishment enough for his dwindling audience; he had to follow it up
with this sad excuse for a comedy.  One thing, though: he forgot to make
it funny.  I haven't groaned so much at a flick since the reel for
SUPERNOVA started up.
There's so much Stink to go around here, it's hard to know where to
start.  The acting - what little there was of it - was painfully
executed; the writing was done in pale crayon, with no hint of feasible
plot development whatsoever; and director Ephron just needs her butt
whupped and her access to the camera taken away permanently.  This was
the most over-written, under-funny, blindly directed, so-called "comedy"
I think I've ever seen.  It wasn't Dark.  It wasn't Broad.  It was just
D-U-L-L.
It'll be hard for me to choose between this one and Stupornova when the
time comes for Worst Of 2000.  No, let me not tell that lie; SUPERNOVA
still wins by a nose.  But LUCKY NUMBERS came close enough to make me
skulk, growling, from the theater.  Besides the overall stench, the two
movies had something else in common: a lack of opening credits.  And who
could blame them? I know I wouldn't want to take "credit" for either one!
The only good thing to come out of LUCKY NUMBERS was Michael Rapaport,
one of the most underrated White Dudes in the business.  Too bad Dale
didn't take a swing at Ephron with that bat of his.  Mr. Rapaport, you
certainly deserve better.  And Mr. Travolta, after threatening us with
"Battlefield Earth 2: The Ego Returns", you deserve *exactly* what's
coming to you.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
When Darryl Mitchell appeared on-screen as lazy cop Pat Lakewood's
partner, Officer Chambers [as if we needed to see yet more good actors
wasted on this drivel!], I was sure that there'd be lots of Wacky Black
Stuff to come; gotta admit, I was pleasantly surprised to see that
Mitchell was the straight man to poor Bill Pullman's Idiot.  Thank god
for small favors.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
Between John Travolta's wack acting and his wackier haircut, he looks
and acts like a morph of Jerry Lewis and Moe Howard.  He really needs to
stop it.  Now.  And somebody should stop director Nora Ephron before she
Kills again.
LUCKY NUMBERS (rating: redlight):
Unlucky me, I wasted 108 minutes of my life watching this mess.

Here's a piece of advice that you've always heard. 
"Don't wait until the last minute!"  If you do, you'll
have very few options at your disposal.  In the dark
comedy, "Lucky Numbers," manic Russ Richards (John
Travolta) finds that he's at the point where he's
waited way too long.  With no other way out, his only
route of escape is down the expressway of amorality.  
His journey towards the dark side stems from his
idiotic side ventures.  He's a greedy schemer and it
is this shortcoming that puts him on the brink of
bankruptcy.   All of his ideas seem destined to fail. 
In his latest enterprise, he has opened a snowmobile
dealership.  However, the area is experiencing an
unseasonable heat wave.  And as Christmas grows near,
wading pools are selling faster.  He's quickly losing
money, while the bank wants to foreclose on his home. 
He'll need to come up with a whopping plan to bail him
out of his precarious situation.
Yet, being unethical is not something that seems
totally alien to our desperate hero.  He oozes a slick
confidence and a hokey charm that suggests that no
problem is too big and that no solution is too
bizarre.  Most of all, he's ready to do what it takes
to bail out of his financial woes.  Or is he?
Realizing that his station broadcasts the Pennsylvania
State lottery drawing, he conjures up a plan to fix
the lottery and walk away a multimillionaire.  With
the help of his strip club owner friend, Gig (Tim
Roth), and Crystal the Lottery Girl (Lisa Kudrow),
they design and execute the unimaginable with
surprising efficiency.  So far so good.  However, when
other people get a whiff of what they've done, they
all want a piece of the winnings.  Russ gets
blackmailed for so much that he's now in even more
debt!  As more and more complications arise, his
options narrow and become less savory.  Soon, (and
this is one of the film's more clever twists),
fearless Russ is reduced to a cowardly state while the
daffy Lotto girl ascends into a greed-driven 'cleaner'
who goes out to tie up any loose ends.
Droll it is thanks to Travolta's bravura performance
with his exaggerated voice inflections and mannerisms,
but it's not as dark or as edgy as it should be.  This
is the kind of film where zany characters and absurd
situations drive the film.  Some, like the inclusion
of a two-bit but touchy-feely thug (Michael Rappaport)
and the asthmatic accomplice (Michael Moore) who
wanted to use his share "to buy his church a new
furnace and then use the rest to start an adult book
store" worked to heighten the film's tone of
absurdity.  But, others like the TV station exec (Ed
O'Neill) seemed flat while the inclusion of the
dimwitted cop (Bill Pullman) who stumbles onto the
case, didn't seem necessary, although it did add a few
goofball moments.  Most awkward, however, was Kudrow,
on whose shoulder the spirit of this film squarely
lies.  Crystal is liberated, conniving, and greedy. 
Kudrow doesn't possess that important sense of brazen
vulgarity, which would have made this film really fun.
 So, like playing the lottery, a few numbers hit and a
few miss.  Better luck next time.

Not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie.
Earlier this year, Nora Ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least
likeable "comedies" called HANGING UP, featuring a bunch of annoying women
(ironically, Lisa Kudrow played one in that film as well) who barely have
time to care about anyone but themselves. Ick...real sweet stuff.
But her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what John
Travolta went through earlier this summer, with a film entitled BATTLEFIELD
EARTH. I seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated
the film, even if it was on a "cheese" factor, as everybody, and I mean
everybody else, pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst
disasters of all time. Yipes...another beauty. So what happens when you put
these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the
ever-versatile Lisa Kudrow? Uhhhm, you guessed it...not much.
PLOT:
In order to escape major financial difficulties, a local weatherman hooks up
with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery. But as
more and more people find out about their scheme, more and more people
demand a part of their winnings, and more and more problems arise.
CRITIQUE:
Simply stated, I didn't laugh once during this entire picture. For a comedy,
it offered me a few smiles, a bunch of nincompoops as characters, a miscast
John Travolta hamming it up and Lisa Kudrow, in what can only described as a
"sluttier" version of her character of Phoebe on TV's "Friends". This film
was not as disastrous as I thought it would be, but it was pretty close.
Thankfully, the clips of Travolta dressed up in goofy outfits, dancing as
the weatherman were left in the film's trailer, and not in this final cut.
And not unlike the worst movie of the year so far, BEAUTIFUL, this film also
managed to feature many unsympathetic, idiotic and just plain irritating
characters in its cast. Foremost was Travolta's character, who declined to
give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie. And for me, the
casting choice of John Travolta for this role was just plain wrong. He
didn't fit the part. I just saw him in GET SHORTY the other day and thought
about how perfect he was for that role. A cool, calculating roughneck with a
certain hip, suave "je ne sais quoi". In this film, he looks like he's
trying to be funny, trying to be bad, trying to be good. We're not supposed
to be able to notice that, and when we do, at least in my case, I consider
it a wrong choice in casting.
Add that to Lisa Kudrow, boring us with yet another one of her patented
"dumb blonde" routines, but this time, dressed in sexier outfits. Michael
Rapaport, stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite
up at the same speed level as everyone else. And a truckload of empty
comedic bullet shells, and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience
anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize. The only real good
thing that I could say about this film is that its story was actually
half-interesting and never really bored me. I also liked Michael Moore's
perverted cousin character, and I loved, and I say it again, loved the
character that Bill Pullman played. Give this dude his own movie! He played
a lazy cop, a man who tries everything not to do any real work. He fakes
injuries to get off duty, tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't
have to fill out any forms...now there's a base of humor. Sadly, the
filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left
in the film. And there's not much else I can say about this movie, folks. On
the whole, it was lame, included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling
around in a pool of unfunny lines, and very little of interest for any
target audience. But get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy
cop played by Pullman and I'm there!

"Lucky Numbers" is one of those botched criminal activity films where 
one thing goes wrong right after the other; only these culprits are more 
regular-person-esque and less bad-guy-like (a smiley, but dim weatherman 
and a bubbly, but cruel lotto girl for starters.) 
Unfortunately, this cute chain of mishaps has little to tie together. 
There's no emotion arc and for a comedy, there's only a handful of good 
laughs. Still the acting is awesome, Travolta and Kudrow rock; and the 
somewhat amusing chain is directed well. 
The end result ... a film that would make a fine watch on TV if there 
were nothing else to do, but at the theater ... just can't fill the big 
screen. 
Lucky Numbers. Copyright Š 2000. Rated R. 
*  Starring John Travolta, Lisa Kudrow, Tim Roth, Ed O'Neill, Michael

 This is John Travolta's unlucky year. First, "Battlefield Earth." Now, this long-delayed dark comedy directed by Nora Ephron ("Sleepless in Seattle," "You've Got Mail"). Travolta is Russ Richards, an overextended Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, TV weatherman who plots with a sexy, promiscuous Lotto-ball girl, Crystal Latroy, played by Lisa Kudrow ("Friends"), to rig the state numbers game to win $6.4 million. Crystal gets her moronic cousin (documentary film-maker Michael Moore) to purchase the winning ticket, but their double-dealing caper crumbles as everyone who knows about it wants a piece of the action. In the script by Adam Resnick ("Cabin Boy"), which is loosely based on a real incident from the '80s when someone tried to fix the daily number drawing in the Pennsylvania lottery, Russ Richards is a self-centered celebrity who has his own reserved table at the local Denny's and promises his audiences unseasonably mild weather in December. Problem is: he's is a shallow,!
 unsympathetic character, as is Crystal Latroy - and neither John Travolta nor Lisa Kudrow can overcome that fatal flaw. No one cares if Richards' snowmobile business is tanking and that he may lose his beloved Jaguar convertible. In fact, all the characters - from Tim Roth as a strip club owner to Ed O'Neill as the TV station manager to Michael Rapaport as a hip-hop thug wielding a lethal World Series commemorative bat - are tacky, greedy and unethical. But Bill Pullman lends comic relief as a bumbling, inept cop who unwittingly breaks the case. When did John Travolta's voice get so whiny and irritating? And why is he eating himself out of a career as a leading man?  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Lucky Numbers" is a mocking, mean-spirited 3. Everyone emerges a loser.

LUCKY NUMBERS (director: Nora Ephron; screenwriter: Adam Resnick;
cinematographer: John Lindley; editor: Barry Malkin; cast: John Travolta
(Russ Richards), Lisa Kudrow (Crystal), Tim Roth (Gig), Ed O'Neill
(Dick), Michael Rapaport (Dale), Daryl Mitchell (Chambers), Michael
Moore (Walter), Bill Pullman (Lakewood), Michael Weston (Larry);
Runtime: 105; Paramount Pictures; 2000)
A screwball comedy set in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1988, where the ethics for
the main characters become so twisted allowing everyone in the film to
be perceived as either an incompetent jerk or an incompetent crook.
"Lucky Numbers'' is a fictional film derived from an actual attempt in
the early 1980s to fix the Pennsylvania lottery.
Nora Ephron directs this farce with the aim to mine all the laughs taken
from the foibles of the slow-witted characters and pull all the nuggets
out of their characterizations that Adam Resnick scripted, as the film
holds up rather well until the clumsily navigated tidied up ending,
which made no ethical sense. The film's main assets are in the sterling
cast, who all have a flair for making their roles brim with comedy. The
key ingredient to this comedy, is John Travolta, who was never better in
a comic role, and the good chemistry between him and Lisa Kudrow, who as
a sexpot with a heart of steel, is just fabulous in making her character
both despicable and amusingly likable.
Russ Richards (Travolta) is a big-time celebrity in the small-town of
Harrisburg, where he's the obnoxious, overfriendly TV weatherman and the
owner of a failing snowmobile dealership due to unseasonably warm winter
weather, and as a further torture he has to report on the warm weather
every broadcast. We see in the opening moments, that he's a narcissistic
jerk but one who's so corny and willing to please, that he's oddly
acceptable as a human being. The first shot of him is driving in his
1970's Buick Riviera and waving to a car full of schoolgirl admirers in
another car and then pulling into his reserved parking spot in his
favorite Denny's restaurant and taking a seat pompously at his private
table, where he not only doesn't mind being interrupted while eating to
pose for a photo with a young fan and his pushy father, but relishes in
all the attention he receives. It was a brilliant comic set-up, which
gave the film a delicious comic aroma.
Russ is a straight guy living a straight life who makes one regrettable
unethical move in his entire life, because he is pressed for money and
is unable to borrow an advance on his salary and is unable to secure a
top-notch agent to look for work in bigger TV markets. For this one
mistake, he is made to suffer for it during the entire film. For
unethical help, he visits his gangster-connected old friend, a suave and
mannerly owner of a strip joint club, Gig (Roth), who gets him to agree
to let Dale the Thug (Rappaport) rob the snowmobile place as part of an
insurance scam, by convincing him "Robbery is like a visit to the
podiatrist." When the robbery is botched, the weatherman's life will
become a series of comic errors, and his public wall of invincible
confidence starts crumbling.
When his money problems increase, as the baseball wielding Dale the Thug
wants his bail money and the money due for the robbery. He, thereby,
goes back to Gig for further advice and is told to think of his problem
as if it was a continual medical one. The next procedure, he is told by
Gig, is like removing a rotten tooth, and to remove the tooth he should
use his connections with Crystal (Lisa Kudrow), the Lotto Ball girl at
the station where he works and get her to rig the balls in the lottery.
Their simple plan requires a beard to collect the winning ticket. Her
uncouth cousin Walter (Moore) is recruited to be that beard and buy the
ticket and collect the 6 million in winnings, for his part in the scam
he will get $20,000. His only quirks are that he quotes from the Bible,
is a horny masturbator, and has a serious case of asthma.
Since all these people are goofy, they naturally get away with rigging
the lottery but run into unforeseen problems. These problems lead to
outrageous solutions in trying to solve them, as the asthma-stricken
Walter has the ticket removed from him by Crystal when he holds out for
more money while unfortunately in the middle of an asthma attack; a
bookie who figures the scam out ends up bludgeoned to death in the river
by Dale; and when the sleazy married station manager Dick (O'Neill) who
is having an affair with Crystal, also figures out the scam and
blackmails his employees for a rich payoff, this only leads to more
complications and a visit from Dale, who pretends he is Ted Williams and
Dick is the baseball.
Bill Pullman has a delightful role as an inept and lazy policeman
tracking down the missing bookie and luckily rescuing Dick and Crystal
from being attacked by Dale. His slow-thinking process and keen sense of
timing to draw out the comic situation, made his role a very funny one.
This was a satisfying comedy (the best way to judge a comedy is if you
are laughing -- and, I was). It was effortlessly well-acted, with plenty
of sight gags and changes of facial expression on the bewildered
characters to make almost every scene a funny one. "Lucky Numbers"
didn't hit the jackpot, as the story was too shallow to allow for that,
but I got some good comedy action for the price of the movie ticket.

In LUCKY NUMBERS, by director Nora Ephron (YOU'VE GOT MAIL), Russ 
Richards is a local celebrity who has it all, right down to an omelet 
that a diner has named after him.  The television weatherman at a 
station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he is so popular that everyone 
wants to take his picture.  "Fame, fortune and my own private parking 
place -- I had it all," he tells us in voice-over.
Well, he did have it all until he made a major investment in snowplows 
during an unseasonable winter warm spell.  Now facing bankruptcy, he has 
gone from being a cocky guy who loves to ham it up with bad jokes to a 
petrified worrier who is willing to risk imprisonment to save his lavish 
lifestyle.  He has big plans to be a famous television game show host, 
so he doesn't want to let a negative net worth get in his way.
Working again with Ephron, as he did in the sappy MICHAEL, John Travolta 
appears this time as Russ, a lovable doofus without any hint of wings.  
Travolta's over-the-top character is as likeable as he is stupid.  In 
fact, the warm weather seems to have fried everyone's brains.  A few 
bright characters would have made for a nice contrast.  
Tim Roth, as Russ's nefarious criminal friend, is significantly 
underutilized.  Great at playing bright but explosively dangerous 
characters, Roth is given almost nothing to do other than chop 
vegetables in the kitchen of a sleazy nightclub.  Any action is 
delegated to a hit man whom he has on speed dial.
As the Vanna White of the Pennsylvania Lottery, "the lotto ball girl," 
Lisa Kudrow is Crystal Latroy.  Wearing tight-fitting, sequined dresses, 
slit way up the side, Crystal is syrupy sweet on camera and foul-mouthed 
tough off camera.  In short, Kudrow plays Kudrow but as a slightly 
darker version of her usual ditzy blonde character.  The comedic 
jousting between Travolta and Kudrow make for some of the movie's most 
entertaining moments.
The heart of the story is a big scam to rig the lottery.  Precisely how 
the money is to be divided up becomes the picture's longest running 
joke.  Documentarian Michael Moore (ROGER & ME) gets a nice small role 
as Crystal's asthmatic cousin, who is paid to redeem the winning ticket.
The problem with LUCKY NUMBERS is that the audience's lucky numbers 
don't come up nearly often as they should.  Many scenes are inspired, 
but most just drag on without any comedic payoff.  There are so many 
minor characters and subplots that you want to take a pair of scissors 
to the print and cut some of the them out.  An overgrown bush of a 
picture, it is in bad need of pruning to let the best flowers have the 
light to bloom.  
The best moments are silly fun, but there just aren't enough of them.  
When you go to your local multiplex's box office, pick another number 
and wait for video on this one.
LUCKY NUMBERS runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language, sexuality, some 
drug use and brief violence and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

Russ Richards is the TV weatherman at WPTA in Harrisburg PA and a local
celebrity who has his own, reserved table at Denny's. He is also about to
lose his shirt in an unsuccessful snowmobile franchise as the city basks in
the spring-like December weather. Russ, desperate to avoid financial ruin,
teams up with the station's Lotto girl, Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow), to
pull off a scam and rig the state's lottery. Everything works out,
initially, but the scheme unravels in a big way in "Lucky Numbers."
Nora Ephron, director of such sentimental schmarm as "Sleepless in Seattle"
and "You've Got Mail," takes a turn with "Lucky Numbers" and enters the
realm of the caper flick. Other such crime comedies, like the 1951 marvel,
"The Lavender Hill Mob," or the 1972 Robert Redford starrer, "The Hot
Rock," set the standard for the genre with their mixture of
action/suspense, satire and broad comedy. The charm of these films lay in
their strong build-up of the caper and the gyrations the principle must
undertake as the well-laid plans go awry.
Ephron's entry into the genre of crime caper movies, while not at the same
level as the older films, is a solid, entertaining flick that benefits from
a superb cast that transcends the formula of the script by Adam Resnick.
Based on the 1980 Pennsylvania State Lottery scandal, the story is by the
numbers as we meet Russ Richards, a man on top of the celebrity pile in his
little burg who enjoys the perks of his minor fame. His big ambition is to
get out of Harrisburg and head for the big times - host of his own TV game
show. But, bad investments, unseasonably warm weather and a taste of the
good life are driving Russ to bankruptcy.
First, Russ tries to get a salary advance form his hard-ass boss, Dick
Simmons, and is unceremoniously turned down. He next tries to hit up his
old buddy, Gig, a strip club owner, but gets turned down by him, too. Gig
does offer some advise, though it is highly illegal - find a beard to play
a particular Lotto number and rig the daily lottery to come up with that
number. And, it looks like it may be an easy thing when Russ approaches
Lotto girl Crystal, a sexy and greedy young lady, with the plan and she
jumps at the chance to make millions. The ball is in play, so to speak, as
the couple conspires to rip the state off for a fortune.
The inept pair, against all odds, is able to pull the scam off without a
hitch. Crystal's cousin Walter (documentary filmmaker Michael Moore) is
pulled in to be the front man, purchasing the winning ticket. Everything
seems to going fine as they successfully rig the drawing. Then things start
to fall apart. Walter, realizing the ticket's worth, is no longer happy
with the paltry $20000 he was first offered. He wants an equal share of the
winnings and won't give up the ticket unless he gets it. Gig also wants a
piece of the pie and demands a 20% cut of the total. Then, a local bookie
gets wind of the scheme, prompting Gig to have the guy bumped off by his
crony, the loony Dale the Thug (Michael Rapaport). Once Dale finishes his
lethal task, he demands $500000 from the hapless, now scared, Russ. Things
are further complicated when a malingering cop, Pat Lakewood (Bill
Pullman), and his gung-ho partner Chambers (Daryl Mitchell) are put on the
case of the missing bookie. Another wrench hits the works when station boss
Dick figures out the crime and wants half of the money. Soon, Russ is
financially worse off than before he committed the crime.
Despite the large cast of characters, the movie moves along at a brisk pace
as the crime and its aftermath of greed unfold and Russ finds himself in a
place, among ruthless people, that he just wants out of. Travolta, who
seems to be beefing up to Marlon Brando proportions, plays Russ Richards
with a mix of confidence of a big fish in the small pond of Harrisburg TV
and fear of losing everything when his plans backfire. He's fine while in
control of things, but breaks down quickly when they go to hell in a hand
basket. Travolta is the straight man of the cast, but gets good moments as
he tries, and repeatedly fails, to get out of his predicament.
The rest of the cast ably handles their various tasks. Kudrow plays
completely out of her usual ditzy characters as the hard-bitten, greedy
Lotto babe who thinks nothing of using her body to get what she wants. It's
a different kind of roll for Kudrow, though not one I necessarily liked -
Crystal may be good looking, but she is no Mother Theresa. Tim Roth and Ed
O'Neill lend their professionalism to their perfs as Gig and Dick. The real
comic relief, though, comes from Michael Rapaport and Bill Pullman.
Rapaport's Dale is over-the-top crazy as a very loose canon. Dale, and his
World Series commemorative baseball bat, does drastic damage to the various
players. He's all hopped up on wine coolers and anti-depressants and will
not take "no" for an answer. He's also not very bright as he tries to get
rid of Jerry the bookie by taping a small brick to his wrist and dumps the
body in the river. Pullman has some goofy fun as the inept cop who
unwittingly breaks the case.
I have never been a fan of Nora Ephron's film work, but I have to admit
that the lady does surround herself with top-notch talent behind the
camera. The capable and varied lensing by John Lindley ("Pleasantville")
gives the film a crisp look. Production designer Dan Davis, a three-time
Ephron collaborator, catches the 80's feel, though that period is less
distinctive than the 60's and 70's. Other tech tasks are also well handled.
"Lucky Numbers" isn't hurt by the formula story and benefits greatly from
the talented cast. There is ample humor, though little suspense. Nora
Ephron proves herself a competent filmmaker and takes on the crime caper
with professional ability. It's not as wild and wacky as "The Hot Rock" (a
film I highly recommend), but it has its moments and its laughs. I had a
good time and give it a B-.
