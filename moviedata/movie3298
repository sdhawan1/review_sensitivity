     Music by Ennio Morricone.  This was supposed banned (somewhere) for many
years.  This early Algerian production is a gritty drama about the liberation
of Algiers from the French.  It's a fairly straightforward political thriller,
and it's hard to tell why it was banned (perhaps for political reasons?).  The
only "objectionable" scenes are one or two depicting the torture of Algerian
revolutionaries.
     Directed by Derek Jarman, with music by Coil.  At this stage (way before
Caravaggio), Jarman seems to be more interested in the interplay of light,
color and sound than in creating any type of narrative structure.  His human
figures move through abstract and (treated) real landscapes, but their movement
is usually "clipped," as if seen through strobe lights.  Some interesting
light/color textures reminiscent of Brakhage, but on the whole I found this to
be much less interesting than Caravaggio.
     If this is representative of the Taiwan "New Wave," than the movement
still needs at least a few years to mature.  There are some definite breaks
with the traditional Taiwanese melodrama but old values (both cinematic and
philosophical) still retain a stranglehold.  This "realist" depiction of rural
farm life and harsh economic realities is smothered  by stock characters and
situations and cloying sentimentality.
