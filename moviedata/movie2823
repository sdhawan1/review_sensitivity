Yes the femme fatales are back with a vengeance. Wonder Woman (Anita
Mui), Invisible Woman (Michelle Yeoh) and The Thief Catcher (Maggie
Cheung).
If you consider yourself male then consider yourself an endangered
species in this movie. Males are good for providing temporary love
interests, before being efficiently disposed off. So let's rid the movie
of waste products like husbands and boyfriends, and once again THE
HEROIC TRIO can remain focus on their mission  the defeat of a
powerful, chemically enhanced mutant, monopolising clean water in post
apocalyptic Hong Kong.
Gone is the light-hearted humour sprinkled over action packed sequences
that laced the original movie. Instead this episode is filled with the
dark undertones of a suffering oppressed society. So much so that our
heroines are perpetually morose and depressed, not the chirpy female
vixens that dressed loudly and mightily kicked arse in the original.
What ultimately killed this movie for me, was when my favourite Chinese
actress, Michelle Yeoh was sacrificed  that was the last straw, an
unforgivable move. When this happened I lost all interest in what
happened next and wished that a sequel was never made to the delightful
original HEROIC TRIO, now sadly the HEROIC DUO.
Disappointing, very disappointing.
