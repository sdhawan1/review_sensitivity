"$" had a marketing problem: no one knew how to
pronounce the title.  Later, the film was retitled
"Dollars", then "The Heist" for foreign distribution,
but the damage had already been done.  Which is a
pity: while derivative (the film's story had been
lifted from 1970's "Perfect Friday") the film has
many entertaining scenes.
Warren Beatty stars as a bank security officer
who is in cahoots with childlike prostitute
Goldie Hawn.  Their scheme is to empty the safe
deposit boxes of three criminals, all of whom are
customers of both Hawn and Beatty's bank.  Beatty's
character is likeable but over his head (as usual).
After looting the boxes during a phony bomb threat,
his victims (gregarious Army sergeant Scott Brady,
raspy-voiced drug runner Arthur Brauss, and Vegas
casino embezzler Robert Webber) discover the
crime and in a lengthy chase attempt to corner
Beatty and recover the ill-gotten money.  The film
is set in Hamburg, (West) Germany, and Gert Frobe
plays Beatty's elderly, gullible bank boss.
"$" is for adults only.  There is much female
nudity, and Brauss gets tortured with a switchblade.
But those with proper stomachs will enjoy the
humor, whether it comes from Hawn getting chased
around her apartment by her johns, or Beatty
playing 'hero' in a bank vault all the while
robbing it.  There is much tension as well,
which climaxes with Beatty stumbling around a
frozen lake with Brauss' car bearing down on him.
Quincy Jones is credited with the driving score,
and Little Richard sings the often reprised theme
song ("Money Money Money").  Beatty and Hawn were
an item at the time of filming, and would be
re-united in the 1974 film "Shampoo".
