You've got to love Disney.  No matter what they serve up, it is a guaranteed
success as long as it's animated.  Kids have to go see the movie.  Then they
have to get the toys.  Oh, the video came out?  Got to buy it, or risk
little Billy's temper tantrums for the next month.  All of this culminates
in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to Mecca:  A visit to the Magic
Kingdom.  Stay at the Disneyland Hotel!  Buy a Disney t-shirt!  Eat an ice
cream Mickey Mouse on a stick!  It's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly
when you think about it.  Dale Carnegie should have had it so good.  What's
most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of
originality.  You see, Disney animated features these days have two
components:  Theme and plot.  The theme changes with each new movie; the
plot does not.  The plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient
fable are dropped, and try as they might to rise above the characters of
previous features, they are nearly always destined to do no more than the
same.  However, while the success of a Disney animated feature is generally
a given as far as box-office receipts, merchandising dollars, and glimmers
in the eyes of little children, critically they are as varied as anything
else that Hollywood has to offer.  Luckily, Disney's latest animated
offering, MULAN, manages to be engaging and refreshing, even while rife with
formula.
The film starts with the invasion of ancient China by the Huns, led by the
imposing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer).  Soon, China's emperor (Pat Morita)
mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the
country shall serve to fight in China's defense.  When the Fa family is
served notice, it is the elderly father, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) who must
answer the call, as there are no other males in the household.  Fearing her
father will surely be killed in battle, Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) disguises
herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the Chinese army.
MULAN, based on a Chinese epic poem, is a classic tale of the triumph of the
ugly duckling.  Mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family, as she has
a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role, and in a very
amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential
husband, we see that "grace" is not one of her strong points.  Very early
on, we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's
family, and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker,
Mulan fails at that task.  By leaving home to fight in her father's place,
she may not only spare his life, but bring honor, too.
As is the case with most Disney musicals, the songs are first rate and
pervasive throughout the film.  I'm not sure if they will get much airplay,
but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come Oscar
time.  Both Lea Salonga, who provides the singing voice for Mulan, and Donny
Osmond who sings for Shang, the captain of Mulan's army unit and obligatory
love interest, are more than competent, although Salonga's voice translates
much better to animation.  You have to hear it to understand.
Interestingly, the musical numbers which are so often done with big
flourishes are surprisingly muted in MULAN.  There is no significantly big
number, which is customary as the second or third song in a Disney film, but
this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie.  It is,
however, an expectation which has been built by Disney's own formulaic
history, and some viewers may feel as if something is missing.
Artistically, the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of
Chinese artwork, and although this may not live up to the vibrance so
associated with many of the other Disney works, it helps to contribute a
more authentic, and therefore more credible, nature to what otherwise may be
seen as a typically "Disneyfied" ethnic tale.  There are also a couple of
visually standout scenes, one involving the charge of Shan-Yu's Hun army,
which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery Disney animators have
employed since the chandelier in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The other scene
worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it.  When Mulan resolves to take
her father's place, she dons her father's old battle armor, and unsheathes a
sword.  As she does so, you can see her reflection in the polished metal.
It just left me thinking, "That was really cool."
A wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film,
varying from the straight, such as Soon-Tek Oh as Fa Zhou, to the comical,
such as Harvey Fierstein as Yao, a gruff, pugilistic member of Shang's
conscripted army.  Even more outrageous is Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the
diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after Mulan.  Although an obvious
attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by Robin Williams in ALADDIN,
Murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance.
I found the choice of B.D. Wong as Shang a little strange (you may remember
him as Martin Short's wedding planner assistant in THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE),
but they used Robbie Benson for the voice of the Beast in BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST, so I guess anything's possible.  In any event, Wong performs
admirably as well.
One character which provides a significant amount of humor is Grandmother
Fa.  She deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to
the movie, but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people.
June Foray, who supplies Grandmother Fa's speaking voice, is a venerable
voice actress who may be best known for her work as Rocky the Squirrel and
Natasha Fatale (as in Boris and Natasha).  Marni Nixon, who provides
Grandmother Fa's singing voice, is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices
for Anna in THE KING AND I, Maria in WEST SIDE STORY, and Eliza in MY FAIR
LADY.  With this in mind, hearing Grandmother Fa is like listening to a
little piece of history.
MULAN is the latest Disney animated feature to get away from some of the
eurocentrism which for so long dominated Disney films.  In an effort to be
culturally sensitive (and to avoid a "Miss Saigon"-type debacle), Disney has
also wisely chosen to employ many Asian-American actors for both lead and
supporting roles.  In addition to the actors already mentioned, the cast
includes such ubiquitous talents as James Hong, Gedde Watanabe, James
Shigeta, and George Takei.  I guess Clyde Kusatsu wasn't available.
At a running time of slightly under an hour and a half, MULAN moves quickly
and provides solid entertainment for both children and, happily, adults.
This is the kind of Disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do
next, rather than hope that the next one is better.

Ahhh, finally a big Disney animated film with strong female lead that
doesn't wear buckskin.  I envisioned her fighting for her chance to go
to war with men (ala G.I. Jane) and imagined that perhaps the film might
shatter some stereotypes about women.  I was a little queasy after
hearing the first song, which was all about how looking pretty and
having a small waist will bring both a good husband and honor to your
family.  But it got better.
Mulan is based on a true story about a clumsy young girl who defends her
country by cross-dressing (and, no, it's not the Ed Wood story).  See,
China is under siege by Huns and each family has to send one member to
war.  Rather that see her aging father go to battle, Mulan cuts her
hair, sneaks off in the middle of the night and joins the Chinese army.
Fearing for the safety of Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), her father prays to the
spirits of their ancestors for her safety.  Mistakenly, the ancestors
send Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a pipsqueak dragon that resembles a small
version of Tigger.  Together with a questionably lucky cricket, Mushu
sets off to find and protect Mulan.
Still hiding her female identity, Mulan finds herself inexperienced at
war but quickly learns to play with the boys and eventually wins their
trust.  The picture leads up to a big showdown with the head Hun (Miguel
Ferrer) who has  so help me God  yellow eyes.  I'm not going to tell
you who wins the battle, but I will say that it is Disney-esque.
Murphy steals the show as the voice of Mushu, the best Disney sidekick
in recent memory.  His presence livens things up and gives the picture
and edgier feel, due mostly in part to the possibility of hearing Mushu
call the Huns `a bunch of dirty ass motherhuckers' or telling Mulan
`Damn, Bitch - If you was a boy, I'd like to give you a ride home and
smell your feet'.  He doesn't, but he's still very funny.
Although there is little to complain about (even the songs aren't
totally annoying), the character of the head Hun is under developed and
ineffectively used.  But maybe I'm just spoiled after seeing the lovely
Hades (James Woods) from last summer's Hercules.  There are also a lot
of really awful Chinese stereotypes, but what do you expect from a
Arab-hating fag-bashing multimedia conglomerate?  Oh yeah, expect a huge
backlash from the Hun community.  You may have to cross a picket line to
see this film, but that OK, because good movies come before the
effective portrayal of certain ethnic groups any day.

     I went into Mulan with high expectations, due mostly to the
     sweeping ads we've been seeing for months, and my own hopes that
     Disney could make an animated movie that didn't talk down to the
     audience, and I wasn't disappointed.  Mulan matches all
     expectations and exceeds them, returning to the qualities that we
     can see in Disney's classic era of animated films, sitting
     alongside Snow White and the Seven Dwarves as one of Disney's best
     ever.  The key to Disney's success in the animated-musical field
     has always been their ability to market their films to both
     children and to the grown-ups who will take the children to the
     movie.  With Mulan, Disney ups this angle quite a bit by instead
     making a grown-up movie that the kids can like as well, rather than
     the other way around.
     Mulan succeeds because it never talks down to the audience, and
     doesn't paint needless stereotypes or use stock characters in
     unoriginal ways.  Mulan features a wide smorgasboard of great
     supporting characters, none of which over-dominate the film, and
     all of which give us just enough entertainment to leave us thirsty
     for more of them.  This applies to everyone from Mulan's dog,
     Mulan's grandmother, and the cricket she gives Mulan, Mulan's
     ancestors (including a great voice-over from George Takei), Mulan's
     comrades-in-arms, Mulan's captain, the barbarian bad-guy, and many
     more.  All of the supporting characters are there to support Mulan,
     letting her shine, and she does, as a truly heroic female character
     who does not rely on old stereotypes to win our hearts.  She's not
     a tom-boy, she's not a egg-head, she's not shy, she's not
     egotistic; Mulan is as close as Disney has ever come to having a
     believable, human character, and she is also Disney's first true
     hero who succeeds on her own terms and her own merits.  She
     succeeds not because she reacts to the events of her life, she
     succeeds because she is the active figure driving the whole story,
     in exciting, thrilling scenes, and well-considered character
     scenes.  Finally, there is Eddie Murphy as Mushu, who provides nice
     measured amounts of comic relief and cute asides to Mulan (and us)
     that give this drama just enough humor to please us all.
     The film works as well because the story and art work together to
     give us an unified vision of a China that melds smoothly with what
     we might already know, without painting wild, offensive
     stereotypes, and without Westernizing the characters.  Mulan goes
     against tradition with the full knowledge that it could mean her
     own death in several ways, but she does it not out of heroic pride,
     but out of the driving need to protect the family honor.  This
     theme, and the plot and character elements that instill it all
     appear to be firmly loyal to legends and traditions that you can
     see in many of the great Chinese and Japanese film classics, such
     as The Seven Samurai.  Finally, the art and music works in Mulan in
     smooth ways we've not seen from Disney in over 30 years.  There is
     a smoothness to the characters, the backgrounds and the musical
     numbers that melts evenly from scene to scene.  Musical numbers in
     other Disney films often seem forced, but in Mulan, they come and
     go nearly without us noticing, and they all make perfect sense
     within the story, adding a lot to the story.  A favorite of mine,
     in particular, is a musical number about halfway through that
     features the soldiers singing about how much women love fighting
     men, as the number is done in Chinese-character style
     calligraphical art, and it really works.
     For somehow combining elements of Asian legend,  stirring action,
     inticing and vibrant characters, and somehow making a film that can
     appeal to nearly anyone in any family, Mulan very quickly earns
     it's place as possibly the best film Disney studios has ever made,
     and certainly the best in their last 30 years.  If you and your
     family see only one movie this Summer, Mulan could be that movie.

Okay, here's the deal. Y'all remember here a while back, I told you a
tale about an old gunfighter, still sharp after all the years of
dueling it out with anyone who wanted to call him out?  A young
upstart named Fox tried him, and got both barrels in the gut, and
might never be the same again. in a few short months, three upstarts
known as Little Steven, Angry Jeff, and Invisible David are coming to
town, and they're riding hard to prove themselves.  But, the old
gunfighter, Old Walt, don't seem too worried 'bout all that.
Ol' Walt could've kicked his feet up on the bar. He did slack off a
little for a while there, and he almost got taken out. So he sharpened
up his act. Lost some dead wood, built himself over from the ground
up, and regained his reputation as the toughest hombre in town. Some
day, somebody may beat him, but at least for now, he's holding all the
cards.  And, there's another little secret out there that only Walt
hisself knows. He's got cards waiting in the wings that are gonna be
even harder to beat. He's not buying new guns, or trying new
bullets. He's just keeping his weapons in tip-top form, and he's
dedicating his best to the weapons that keep him alive.
Y'all figured out my little allegory this time? The folks at Disney
seem to be getting a little tired of all the doomsayers, sirening the
death of the Walt Disney Company as the animated feature giant. Fox
tried to blast them, and the best they could do was "Anastasia", a
laugh-a-minute cartoon about the Russian Revolution and the only
survivor of Stalin's assasination of the Russian Royal Family.  Nice
choice, guys. Warner Brothers tried to fight back with "Quest For
Camelot," one of the more sloppier pieces of animation to drip out of
the bedpan in a while. And, in the wings, the Dreamworks boys are
readying "Prince of Egypt", the animated story of Moses, another odd
choice for cartooning.
And what does Ol' Walt answer with? Only the best animated feature
they've made since "The Lion King." It's called "Mulan," and it's
based on a Chinese legend about a young girl. And, folks, lemme tell
you, it's a marvel. The soundtrack doesn't rise to new heights, but as
an animated feature film, this is textbook stuff.
Mulan, as voiced by actress Ming-Na Wen, is a young Chinese girl, the
only child born to her father's house. In order to follow Chinese
culture of the day, Mulan should only be a proper young lady, petite,
subservient, and passive. The only way to bring honor to her family is
by marriage, a marriage to some wealthy, respected family. But Mulan
doesn't fit that mold at all. She's adventurous, she's full of
questions, and she's a bit of a tomboy. Her father's love is the light
of her life, though, so she tries to go through with tradition and
make nice for the local matchmaker. Big mistake. She doesn't play the
quiet and obedient woman part too well, and the session is a washout.
But, before this can lay waste to the family's hopes, the Huns invade
the Chinese border, heading straight for the Emperor's palace.  The
emperor (Pat Morita) issues a conscription notice, decreeing that one
male from every family will join the army to fight off this attack.
Mulan's father, a war hero, is now old and crippled from past battles,
but as the only male of his house, he must go to join the fighting. He
is honor bound. Mulan cannot stand the idea of losing her father, and
she knows he won't survive another war, so she chops off her hair,
steals her father's battle armor, and rides off, disguised as a boy,
to serve in her father's place. If her disguise is discovered, her
family will be dishonored, and worse, the law decrees that her
commanding officer, Shang (B.D. Wong), must execute her.  Thankfully,
her ancestral spirits decide to send her a guardian
spirit. Unfortunately, the best they can do is a little red dragon
named Mushu (Eddie Murphy).
What's there to say, people? Disney has quite a rep for bringing
strong female characters into the spotlight, at least in their
animated movies. But Mulan is not like The Little Mermaid's Ariel, or
Belle from Beauty and the Beast. She's not all dreamy-eyed and
wonderous, and she's not book-smart and spunky. Mulan is more
quick-witted and fast on her feet, driven not to prove some great
question, but to do what she can to save her father. She just wants to
make good on the family name. Wen's voice is determined and, like
Pocahontas's Irene Bedard, is feminine but full of strength. There's
only a half-hearted effort to show Mulan trying to sound like a boy,
mainly because it really isn't necessary. The character in the voice
suits the spirit, the spirit of a fighter.
The other voice casting is just as good.  Listen for Harvey Fierstein
as one of Mulan's fellow recruits. He sounds just like one of those
toughs that always got dropped into basic training with John Wayne or
Van Johnson as the sergeant. B.D. Wong pulls off the young commander's
character well, the young man put in charge while his father, a
general, goes off to fight. It was nice to here June Foray's voice
again. For years, she was the voice of Bullwinkle's Rocky, and
countless other legends of Toon Town. Here, she gives Mulan's Grandma
Wu a needed splash of sass. And a special kudo to Eddie Murphy, for
bringing Mushu to the level of Robin Williams' Genie in
Alladin. Murphy plays this strictly as a sidekick thing, stealing
scenes left and right and cracking jokes at every turn. Mushu sounds
like he's just in from Eddie's standup routine, but without the
cussin'. He's hip, streetwise, and drop-dead funny. Robin still owns
the title, but Eddie is a close second.
The true heroes of this movie, though, are the artists who gave the
film the look it has. It goes from being painstakingly gentle and
exquisite, as seen in Mulan's family cherry orchard, to vast and
realistic, seen in the mountain battle scenes. There are scenes of the
Great Wall and the Forbidden City that could pass as "real-film"
cinematography, almost awe-inspiring until you remember what you're
watching, and then even more awe-inspiring to think of the time
involved in such detailed art. These scenes, in particular, harken
back to the super opening of "The Lion King," with the animals in
early morning making the trip to Pride Rock. Compare that footage to
scenes from a National Geographic special if you get a chance, and
you'll get my drift. Even the detail in the artwork of the horse
mirrors Chinese art of the time. These horses are not like Pegasus,
all sleek and tight, they're strong and muscular and round, much like
those seen on silk screens and in sculpture from that time. They even
throw in some Abbott & Costello slapstick during the training
sequences, as this motley band of clods trains to be a fighting
machine.
If I have an argument with Mulan, it's with the music. There is not a
big, show-stopping song here like those in "The Lion King," "Beauty
and the Beast," or "The Little Mermaid."  These songs are just light
and witty, although there is a nice ballad near the beginning.
They're as much for laughs as they are for music's sake. But, to
cancel out my argument, I'd much rather have this fare than be
force-fed another lukewarm ballad that is SUPPOSED to be the
showstopper. "Hunchback" had two of these dramatic, poignant songs
that went zippo, and that godawful monster of music, Michael Bolton,
forever turned me off with that "Go The Distance" thing from
'Hercules'. Since the death of Howard Ashman, the only one to capture
the heart of Disney music has been the team of Tim Rice and Elton
John, in "The Lion King". Until they find another combo like Rice/John
or Ashman/Menken, I'll continue to cringe when I hear a musical number
priming in a Disney feature.
I'm not going to sugarcoat this point, I'm telling you plain out. See
"Mulan." Heck, go see "Mulan" a couple of times. See it once, for the
movie, to laugh, to hear Eddie act a fool, to know the story. Then,
see it again and just look at the artwork. Some museums don't have
this kind of quality. Until the other upstarts learn how to combine
the best of everything and make it all come together to look this
perfect, Ol' Walt will still be the only gun in town, still shootin'
after all these years, and by God, still winnin'.

Mulan is the latest Full-Length Feature Animated Movie to emerge
from the Disney studios.  Being an avid fan of many Disney movies
(having seen _Lion King_ in the theatres 5 times, etc) I went to
see Mulan on opening night, and again a week later to better
formulate my feeling for this movie.  I will admit, I was really,
really looking forward to this film, and as such, it may have
coloured my final impressions of it.  Looking at recent Disney
films, TLK and then Hunchback both raised the bar in terms of not
only visual style and animation quality, but also the (for the
lack of a better word) matureness of storytelling, the characters
involved and the issues tackled.  In three of cases (BatB, TLK
and H) they were followed by films that were both less than
serious and less successful overall.  It was thus in great
anticipation and hopes that I entered Mulan, to be dazzled by
what I had heard to be the most adult Disney film to date.
If there's a film that better exemplifies the schizophrenia of
the Disney full-length feature animation department, I'm not sure
I know one.  In a word, yes, I am disappointed.  The dichotomy
that stands as the culprit that hurts this film is that it is
torn between being a 'serious' film or being a film like
Hercules.  It is as if there were two factions within the
scriptwriters department that were fighting, each stealing parts
of the script to write it in secret of each other, then returning
it.  The end result is a movie that does not balance the elements
of humour and depth, but instead flip-flops between the two, a
situation that left the movie, for me, far to Hercules and not
enough Mulan.  
Hercules was an amusing, if not great film.  How it invades in
Mulan is seen in the amount of slapstick, caricatures and what I
term 'unnecessary toonage' bits, coupled with the ever-classic
"out-of-context" references and humour that spoil, in my opinion,
what was otherwise building. Rather than a balancing act, it
overwhelms the film, preventing any solid and serious thread from
developing and dampening the good parts of the film.
And good parts do abound in the film as well, do not get me
wrong.  There are some very intense scenes that are quite
advanced for Disney; this is, after all, a war movie.  The
destruction of a village, the murder of guards and for perhaps
the first time, blood is shown (on a major character) as a result
of an injury.  Make no mistake here, behind the farcical facade
there is a serious movie trying to get out.  (Which almost leads
me to speculate if they didn't include so much farce to feel they
would then be justified to show more serious) The scene where
Mulan decides to take her father's place is a wonderfully
powerful sequence.  The solemnness of the burnt-out village, and
the death of the main army.  These are both well-handled where
did the film go wrong?
What may be the reason struck me during the second viewing. 
Mulan is not a character-driven movie, as it should be.  Instead,
it is event-driven.  The characters exist only to move the action
ahead to the next scene, or to the next joke.  Actions or
realizations take a half a second to occur, are dwelled upon for
about 30 more, then zip ahead to what's next.  All Disney films
are short, true, but not all _feel_ short.  Mulan felt brutally
short at its total of 89 minutes.  There is very little sense of
character growth, of character's motivations, of character
continuity.  
Perhaps the greatest victim to this is the Hun leader, who is
presented just enough to give the impression he's a mean SOB, but
who's drive isn't expressed enough to make us want to fear or
loath him.  He's evil, pure and straight, so we can't like him. 
Hmmm.  Scar had the motivation of wanting to take power that he
felt was denied to him.  Gaston wasn't necessarily evil, just
selfish, but BatB takes the time to show us how shallow he is,
how he would protect his ego above all else.  In Mulan, a simple
'because it was there' (literally!) mentality is all that is
offered us to dislike the villain.  Mulan herself also suffers
from the 5 second treatment, whether it be the instant decision
to take her father's place, and her instant realisation later on
what the truer reasons may be behind it.  
Of course, one of the most talked about characters is the ever-
present sidekick, in this case, Mushu.  Mushu does have a twist,
however, compared to most other Disney sidekicks, and in this
case, it is that he himself is on a quest, a quest of redemption. 
In the end, however, this does not really change much in the way
of the behaviour or use of the sidekick.  Make jokes, get
character in trouble most of the time, but be there just in time
to save the day.  (What's worse, btw, is that I found many of the
jokes about posing as a man pretty much standard fare, items that
have been used before and hence, relatively predictable) Mushu
shall forever be compared to the Genie in Aladdin as to who is
the more wild sidekick.  Problem is, wildness isn't what this
film required.
Another aspect that could quite well have been left out is the
songs.  Yes, this is not a new argument by many, dating back many
Disney features now, but with Mulan, the songs just add to
further fragment the already tenuous story thread.  (Unintegrated
might be a good word to invent for this situation)  Only one song
did I find worthwhile, and by no surprise, it was the main-piece
song by Donny Osmond.  The score, on the other paw, is amazing. 
Jerry Goldsmith may not have been as skillful as Hans Zimmer in
integrating various themes and music typologies together, but the
score does flow and flow strong when needed.  The soundtrack is
on my to-get list, and will be gotten by this evening.  
Unsurprisingly, the main beauty for this film comes from the
animation.  Breathtaking in many places, the computer-gurus at
Disney have managed to integrate their wares almost seamlessly
into the main pictures, leading to some very jaw-dropping
visuals.  In the middle realm, we have the use of the computer as
a layout-tool, allowing many more sweeping visuals and
camera/angle changes than have been seen before.  Finally, at the
"hands-on" realm, there are some gorgeous backgrounds created in
a Chinese-watercolour-like style and atmosphere, the quality of
which makes me want to own many of the cells and hang them on my
wall.  Not to be outdone here, though, the warring factions (I
mean those at Disney, not he Huns and the Chinese) pepper the
film with caricatures and odd-balls that serve to firmly root one
in their seat, rather than becoming enveloped in the world being
shown on screen.
In the end, even Mulan isn't able to save herself.  No, instead,
she relies on the help of her trusty sidekick to put her plan in
motion.  A very quick wrap-up, and she is home for the final
indignity, that of having to follow in the lines of all Disney
heroines and have her life made complete by getting the guy. 
(Forget all that stuff about discovering who you are, or having
achieved honour through your actions, hey, the REAL honour is
that now you can get married!)
The premise of Mulan is ripe with opportunities and could very
easily have been the most mature Disney film to date.  I'm not
sure who to 'blame' for the result, but I just wish so badly
they'd continued the drive towards a meatier animated feature. 
To say I dislike Mulan, or that I do not recommend it would be
wrong, as oddly as that might sound after this review.  The harsh
words I type above are there simply because of this burning
disappointment I felt after seeing this movie.  But buried behind
Hercules is the real Mulan, IMHO, and what shows through is
enough to make me believe in this film.  I would never call Mulan
the best Disney film ever made, not even close... but it
certainly isn't the worst Disney film made in recent memory
either.

     The first thing I ask of a Disney film is whether the storyteller
took large liberties with the original source. Unfortunately, though I
have several books on Chinese history and folklore, Hua Mulan (or Fa
Mulan, as she is called in this film) lies somewhere in the gray area
between the two, a real person of whom much is told but little is
remembered.  There were some patchy references to Mulan on the
Internet, the best of which were under http://www.chinapage.com.  That
reference indicated that there are is only a little in common among the
tales of Mulan, and for the most part this animated story is fairly
accurate to what is common in those tales.  The one variance is that
the original Mulan stories had her fighting for years and then retiring
before her ruse was revealed.  The Emperor offers her a position at
court, but she refuses it and takes instead a horse as her reward.
This is somewhat different from the Disney version, but then it is hard
to compress an entire military career to an 88-minute movie.  Since
there are no specific stories of her service, the scriptwriters are
probably justified in presenting the time as being just a few months.
For once Disney Studios animated films are reasonably accurate to the
source material.  Perhaps this is some penance for their travesty on
Victor Hugo's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.
     Fa Mulan is the daughter of a former soldier, once a strong
soldier but now old and infirm.  The high- spirited young woman is
being forced into the traditional role of young Chinese women her age.
She has to try to make herself look pretty and submissive enough to be
matched with a man who will prize a submissive and pretty women.  But
she knows that is not her.  She asks her mirror, "When will my
reflection show who I am inside?"  But the time is approaching.  The
Huns have attacked the Emperor's lands and her father is called into
service in the Emperor's army.  Mulan's father is old and sickly, but
the law says that each family must provide a soldier.  (In the legend
Mulan has brother, but he is too young to fight.)  To the mind of the
army that means that Mulan's father must return to military service.
But Mulan knows her father is too weak to serve, and she has other
ideas.  She disguises herself as a man and joins the army herself.
Mulan's ancestors wish to send a powerful dragon spirit to guard her
and give her wisdom, but through a trick they instead send Mushu, a
comical little dragon who needs protecting himself.  Well, you probably
know the rest of the story.  This is a standard telling complete with
the nudity jokes that might seem out of place for a Disney Studios
animated film.
     The artwork is generally extremely good in MULAN, though for
stylistic reasons most of the characters look two-dimensional, and
perhaps a little less realistic than characters drawn in the past.  On
the other hand, there are spectacular aerial views that look more like
live-action film than animation.  Other scenes show good imagination in
recreating classical China from village life to the Emperor's palace
suggesting the Forbidden City, but exaggerated from what that palace
was to what it might have been in stories.  In a film about Chinese
fighting in hand-to-hand combat, the film could have easily degenerated
into excessive and ultimately boring animations of martial arts
techniques.  Happily, the Disney animators resisted that temptation, if
indeed they had it.  And once again each major character is created by
a different team who does art work.  That is the right approach.
Familiar actors voice many of the characters, and I strongly recommend
that the audience stay for the credits.  But I would like to call
specific attention to the speaking voice of Mulan's grandmother done by
the wonderful June Foray.  Foray was the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel
and virtually all of the female characters on ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE.
     But the film is far from perfect.  The antics of Eddie Murphy as
Mushu--who presumably takes his name from a popular Chinese dish--are
sure to be a pleaser, but only for those in the audience for whom any
comedy is better than no comedy.  But it is a sad misstep for others.
One can only feel sorry for the stylists who worked so hard trying to
create an atmosphere evocative of China of the ancient past only to
have that effort sabotaged for the sake of a joke.  The inclusion of
Murphy's Mushu was obviously inspired by the Robin Williams schtick in
ALADDIN, which was equally out of place.  The Chinese history is a
little amiss also.  If this were, as is claimed, the Emperor who had
the Great Wall built, that would make him the Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi.
But he ruled from 221 B.C. to 206 B.C., well before the time of the
Huns, and was anything but the benevolent despot we see in the film.
But except for the inclusion of the painfully inappropriate Eddie
Murphy this is a respectful and respectable version of Mulan's story.
     In the end, MULAN is a sort of YENTL with warfare.  Even at its
silliest it is fun, and at times the images on the screen are the most
impressive of any Disney animated film to date.  Probably the best two
Disney animated films in recent years, or any years, are BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST and MULAN.  Perhaps at Disney they do their best work treating
vulnerable female heroes.  Overall, Walt would have been proud.  I rate
MULAN 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
In the East Market she buys a spirited horse,
In the West Market she buys a saddle,
In the South Market she buys a bridle,
In the North Market she buys a long whip.
At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother,
In the evening camps on the Yellow River's bank.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears the Yellow River's flowing water cry tsien tsien.
At dawn she takes leave of the Yellow River,
In the evening she arrives at Black Mountain.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears Mount Yen's nomad horses cry tsiu tsiu.
She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war,
She crosses passes and mountains like flying.
Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots,
Chilly light shines on iron armor.
Generals die in a hundred battles,
Stout soldiers return after ten years.
On her return she sees the Son of Heaven,
The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall.
He gives out promotions in twelve ranks
And prizes of a hundred thousand and more.
The Khan asks her what she desires.
"Mu-lan has no use for a minister's post.
I wish to ride a swift mount
To take me back to my home."
When Father and Mother hear Daughter is coming
They go outside the wall to meet her, leaning on each other.
When Elder Sister hears Younger Sister is coming
She fixes her rouge, facing the door.
When Little Brother hears Elder Sister is coming
He whets the knife, quick quick, for pig and sheep.
"I open the door to my east chamber,
I sit on my couch in the west room,
I take off my wartime gown
And put on my old-time clothes."
Facing the window she fixes her cloudlike hair,
Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder
She goes out the door and sees her comrades.
Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed.
Traveling together for twelve years
They didn't know Mu-lan was a girl.
"The he-hare's feet go hop and skip,
The she-hare's eyes are muddled and fuddled.
Two hares running side by side close to the ground,
How can they tell if I am he or she?"

To paraphrase a song title from an earlier Disney movie, Mulan is a whole
new world.
 The Mouse Factory's latest feature is a treasure, featuring magnificent
animation, a strong story and finely drawn characters.
 Mulan is the story of a fiesty, head-strong young woman who, unlike other
Disney heroines, isn't seeking her Prince Charming,
 Mulan's motivations are simple; to save her father, serve her country and
find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say.
 The story of Mulan takes place in ancient China at a time when the Huns
have invaded the nation. The emperor has called for a conscription, one man
from each family to join the army and defend the nation.
 Mulan's crippled father is called, but Mulan sneaks off, steals his armor
and takes his place.
 Mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery. Yet, despite the grim
backdrop of war, it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn
that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy.
 The movie utilizes a strong corps of Asian-American talent as the voices
for the main characters, including the wonderful Ming-Na Wen (The Joy Luck
Club) as Mulan, B.D. Wong as Shang, Mulan's commanding officer and later
love interest, Pat Morita as the Emperor and the veteran Soon-Tek Oh as
Mulan's proud, but loving father.
 Also adding to the proceedings is Eddie Murphy as Mushu the dragon, sent
by Mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman.
 His fast, wise-cracking, hip-talking Mushu may seem out of place, but it's
a crowd pleasing performance, especially for the youngsters.
 The movie features only a couple of songs, fewer than most previous Disney
animated flicks, but Mulan's are winners. The music by Matthew Wilder and
lyrics by David Zippel  fit nicely into the plot.
 The overall score by Jerry Goldsmith also is a plus.
 Mulan is a treat, more powerful than Hercules, with more heart than The
Hunchback of Notre Dame.
 At about 85 minutes, Mulan moves rapidly, and will hold the attention of
youngsters from beginning to the end.
 Mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by Disney
and other studios will have to work hard to attain.
 Also, it is hoped that the success of Mulan, and there is no doubt that it
will prove to be a popular vehicle, will spur an interest for more movies
with Oriential or Asian-American themes so as to provide more substantial
roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this
production.
It would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them.

MULAN (Walt Disney Pictures - 1998)
Voices by Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Harvey Fierstein
Screenplay by Rita Hsiao, Christopher Sanders, Philip Lazebnik,
  Raymond Singer, Eugenia Bostwick-Singer
Produced by Pam Coats
Directed by Barry Cook & Tony Bancroft
Running time: 88 minutes
Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned.
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   East meets West in MULAN, the latest installment in Disney's parade
   of annual animated feature films.  An odd fusion of ancient Asian
   traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious
   mass-market commercial sensibilities, this confident entry is easily
   the most engaging and satisfying Hollywood animated feature in years,
   but falls short of actualizing its potential.
   Though not for lack of trying.  In many respects, MULAN is among
   Disney's most mature efforts, skirting the surface of adult themes
   and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat.  The
   violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the
   imagery of a pillaged village, neatly encapsulated in the form of a
   child's discarded doll, is in itself no more harrowing than Luke
   discovering his fallen guardians in STAR WARS, and Mulan's later
   heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the
   most tidy, bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a
   Hollywood animated film, long considered as the last safe refuge for
   the innocent, dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in
   such a provocative manner?  In an instant, idealistic Mulan's
   innocence is lost, and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their
   efforts are spent defending.
   The film, based upon an ancient Chinese fable, centers on a spirited
   young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her
   family's obligatory conscript when China finds itself under attack by
   Huns (cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones, replete with
   glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth, although lent a
   surprisingly genuine sense of menace).  Dipping into the mythology of
   other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated
   revisitings of familiar Western / European fables and literature for
   decades, Disney's new film is boldly set in ancient China rather than
   relocated elsewhere, story intact, to some neutral territory, and
   revels in its East Asian roots; aside from a predominantly
   Asian-American cast providing the film's vocal work, there's liberal
   usage of Oriental iconography throughout, and the artwork reveal
   hints of Japanese anime influence.  While the film does occasionally
   reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking
   pseudo-Asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every
   third sentence grows rather hoary, and I can't imagine that the
   regiment for ancient Chinese warriors *really* included
   karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that
   a movie primarily positioned for American and European audiences
   delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory.  The film also
   freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset; although
   savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately,
   it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it
   does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and
   traditions of Mulan's land.
   At its core, the film is a tale of heroic adventure, and as such
   paints its story in bold strokes of honour, perseverance, nobility
   and courage.  As such, animation is the perfect vehicle for this
   flavour of epic, where stark emotional simplicity is able to
   effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity.  Scenes which
   would play out as unbearably hokey in live action, such as Mulan's
   venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his
   draft notice, are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater
   emotional clarity in animation.  MULAN capitalizes on this during its
   strongest moments, particularly during our heroine's
   character-defining opening half-hour.
   It's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of
   recent Hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick, the
   colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it
   goes slightly awry.  Off to battle, Mulan finds herself being trailed
   by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called Mushu and an agreeable
   little "lucky" cricket, who ostensibly appear to assist in her
   subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief.
   They're affable presences, and not precisely ineffective --
   reasonable amounts of humour are elicited, and Eddie Murphy (who
   voices Mushu) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high
   melodrama, the effect is mildly jarring and, from a storytelling
   perspective, questionable in its necessity.  At training camp, Mulan
   antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits
   (easily characterized simply as the Short Clown, the Skinny Clown,
   and the Big Clown), who provide more levity into the film with
   decidedly less effectiveness, and, in a familiar retread of
   traditional Disney patterns, she grows a certain fondness for a
   handsome, square-jawed young captain, Shang.  Everybody needs love,
   even ancient Chinese warrior princesses, but not necessarily in
   *this* film. The romantic angle, which lets the air out of the sails
   of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings, lacks any genuine spark
   and plays out like a contractual obligation.
   Another staple of recent Disney animated films, a cache of hummable
   little ditties, has also obligingly been carried over to MULAN but
   proves to be a decided weakness.  Composed by Matthew Wilder, none of
   the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing, and one --
   "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" (unimaginatively accompanying a tired
   montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean
   fighting machines) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems
   almost interminable.  Only "Reflections", an early ballad of lament,
   proves to be a song of any consequence, serving as an effective
   showcase for Lea Salonga, one of musical theatre's most wondrously
   pure voices.
   Nonetheless, MULAN is an especially appealing piece of work from the
   Disney factory, with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork; the
   computer-generated stampede of Hun warriors charging down a snow
   mountain is wholly impressive.  While the blatantly child-friendly
   elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film,
   they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable.  Briskly paced
   with a smart, energetic heroine and filled with high adventure, the
   film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father
   and daughter.

For the benefit of curious parents, let's get the formalities out of the 
way. Your kids will have all ball at Disney's "Mulan." Packed with action 
and humor, the film is imaginative, fun and fast-paced, presenting a 
strong tale of female empowerment while imparting a positive message 
about the importance of being true to yourself. 
On the surface level, the film succeeds as fine light entertainment for 
adults as well. The disposable pop songs are mercifully short and few in 
number and the animation is striking, particularly in a majestic scene 
showing hundreds of warriors racing down a mountain slope. Too often, 
computer animation sticks out like a sore thumb when placed in the 
context of a traditionally animated film. Here, the CGI is beautifully 
integrated in a number of scenes that dazzle the eyes with a wealth of 
visual information.
Disney magic aside, "Mulan" is even more interesting when you examine 
what's going on under the surface. Remember all the raised eyebrows last 
year when Eddie Murphy was stopped by sheriffs while giving a ride to a 
transsexual hooker? The motives for his good Samaritan act were 
questioned at the time, but now everything is clear. Eddie was just doing 
research for his role in "Mulan", the first animated cross-dressing 
musical. 
Murphy provides the voice for Mushu, a wise-cracking guardian dragon who 
accompanies our heroine on her adventures. When marauding Huns attack 
ancient China, the government calls for one man from every family to join 
the Imperial Army. Despite his age and physical limitations, Mulan's 
father prepares to go. She objects, only to be told "I know my place. It 
is time you learn yours." Undeterred, the spirited girl lops off her hair,
 dons her father's battle gear and takes off in his place, masquerading 
as a man. Of course, Disney cartoons require comic sidekicks and Mulan 
gets two; a good-luck cricket and Murphy's dragon, who offers advice and 
assistance as the fledgling warrior trains at boot camp for war. 
"Mulan's" humor has a decidedly gay sensibility, with Murphy providing 
one-liners like "I'm doomed! And all because Miss Man decided to take her 
drag show on the road!" Murphy delivers his lines with the kind of 
distinct snap most often associated with gay camp humor. The drag theme 
continues throughout the film, as three of Mulan's bumbling fellow 
soldiers (including the gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein) dress as women to 
infiltrate an enemy stronghold. In geisha drag, the trio throw themselves 
completely into their roles, with a funny mix of slapstick and high camp. 
Hetero audiences may view the scenes as mere farce, but gay viewers will 
know better. Tellingly, the only soldier who doesn't do drag is the 
troop's captain, a hunky leader who spends a good deal of the story with 
his shirt off. 
The film wanders into the Tim Allen approach to gender stereotypes, with 
Mulan's attempts to impersonate a male coming straight from the "men are 
pigs" line of thought. At the urging of her dragon advisor, she spits, 
grunts and gives the other soldiers friendly punches to the arm and slaps 
on the butt. Thankfully, the story doesn't waste much time on this 
overdone line of shtick.
Spirituality plays a role in "Mulan," with four prayer scenes featured 
early in the story. Had the film been set in the Western world, it's 
unlikely that any religious references would have been made, but to many 
contemporary Americans, Eastern faiths are picturesque, exotic and even 
trendy, which makes their inclusion acceptable. In pop culture, religion 
is okay only if it's trippy and several thousand miles away. As if to 
underscore the point, Murphy's character does a mocking impression of a 
Christian evangelist in one funny scene.
In fairness, even the Eastern beliefs receive a bit of tweaking, with 
Mulan's revered ancestors presented as comically bickering ghosts. This 
fits neatly with Disney's Epcot take on Chinese culture, used as an 
attractive motif, but with about as much authenticity as the China 
pavilion at Orlando's World Showcase. While the animation springs from 
the "less is more" school of Chinese art, the Mouseketeers give it a 
Western spin, with fast, swooping movements from the broadly drawn 
secondary characters.
Despite Disney's trademarked candy-coated Americanization of foreign 
cultures, the film still succeeds, thanks to its sense of style, some 
very nice animation and a simple, but genuinely strong story. Young Mulan 
fails when trying to adopt the mannerisms of traditional Chinese women 
and fumbles when pretending to be a man. Only when she ignores societal 
expectations and uses her innate wit and strength of character does she 
succeed. That's a good message and "Mulan" is a good movie. Join the kids 
and whoop during the battle scenes or sit back and evaluate the subtext. 
Either way, you're going to have fun.

        The Disney studios has its formula for annual, full-length animated
features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching
at any given moment.
        Once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character
(female as usual; Disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--Ariel,
Belle, Pocahontas, and now Mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes
in recent years).  Add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking
sidekick or two, pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically
placed show tunes (an introspective number by a pool or looking in a
mirror, a rousing anthem, a cutesy, montage-backed crowd pleaser), pose a
few threats to our engaging lead, and tie things all up neatly by the
closing credits.  Bob's your uncle!
        Kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "Mulan" (or at least the fast food
tie-ins), but familiarity can, after a while, leave grown-ups--this
reviewer included--wishing for a little more.  Maybe an animated feature
without--shock! horror!--the songs, for example?  Or maybe a film in which
a cheeky Chihuahua called Pepe longs to become a matador from Trinidad??
How about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether?
        Like Disney's previous entries, "Mulan" is slow to make its mark.
The animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and
the humorous element, a madcap dragon wannabe (in the guise of a loquacious
lizard with a case of dry mouth, courtesy Eddie Murphy's animated vocal
talents), plays like an inappropriate if necessary (formula-wise)
afterthought.  However, after about an hour everything comes together and
the formula, like it or not, clicks.
        Highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered
pass (which, due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated
imagery, is hard to tell from the real thing), a memorable, show-stopping
musical interlude ("I'll Make a Man Out of You," penned by Matthew Wilder
and David Zippel), and last but not least, Mulan herself.
        Voiced by Ming-Na Wen, Mulan is Disney's strongest female character
to date.  When hordes of Huns pour over China's Great Wall and threaten to
overthrow the Imperial Palace, the emperor decrees that every family in the
land dispatch one man to serve in the Imperial army.  Since Mulan's father
is infirm, but proud, the high-spirited Mulan steals her father's armor
and, incognito, signs up to face the Mongolian menace.
        Attracted to, but not distracted by, her commanding officer Shang
(B.D. Wong), Mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts, wit, and
physical ability.  She's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of
her time.

After the outrageous disappointment that was HERCULES, Disney animation has
recovered.  MULAN is positive proof of that.  And no wonder!  This film has
been a pet project at the Disney Animation Studio in Florida for five years,
first named China Doll, and at a staggering cost of $100 million.  The result
is a delightful, exciting piece of entertainment to come from the Disney
studio.  On my top ten favorite Disney films, MULAN is my second favorite
Disney film of all time, next to THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.
The film opens with a stunning view of the Great Wall of China.  On the top,
we see a soldier pacing back and forthuntil the Huns and their leader, the
ruthless Shan-Yu breach the wall.  General Li informs the Emperor of this, and
he commands him to send parchments to every family in China, searching for men
powerful enough to defeat the Huns.  Meanwhile, Mulan is running late to her
meeting with the Matchmaker, and once she arrives on her horse, Khan, her
mother wastes no time in getting her bathed, powdered, and dressed up for her
meeting.  Her grandmother even gives her a cricket named Cri-Kee, just for
luck.  The meeting, however, turns out to be a disaster, and the Matchmaker
tells Mulan that she will never be able to bring her family honor.
Heartbroken and convinced that she has dishonored her family, Mulan leads Khan
home and sits in the garden all by herself.  Her father, Fa Zhou, comforts her
by showing her the blossoms in the garden, including one that is late.  `I'll
bet that when it blooms,' he says, `It will be the most beautiful of all.' 
Then, Chi-Fu, the Emperor's aide, rides into the village, announcing the
invasion of the Huns and says that one man from each family must serve in the
Imperial Army.  Fa Zhou agrees to come, despite an injury he had suffered in an
earlier war.
Mulan, however, knows that if her father goes into war, he will never be able
to return.  So that night, she decides to steal her father's armor and
disguises herself as a boy to take her father's place.  When her parents and
grandmother find out that she's gone, they start praying to the Ancestors for
help.  Besides, they know that the penalty for a woman impersonating a man is
death!
The Ancestors heed the Fa family's prayers, and summon a disgraced little
dragon, Mushu, who had failed to be a Family Guardian and since then, wants a
second chance, to awaken the Great Stone Dragon to send Mulan home.  Mushu goes
outside to do so, but instead accidentally breaks the statue!  He then decides
to go after Mulan and make her a war hero so that he might be able to regain
his post as a Guardian.  Aided by Cri-Kee, Mushu finds Mulan in the forest,
pondering over how she is going to get into the camp.
Mushu tries to help Mulan out by advising her how to act like a man in the
army, but the first thing he does is cause Mulan to start a battle between the
soldiers.  When the army's captain, Li Shang, appears, everyone blames Mulan
for the trouble.  Shang orders the army to clean up the mess that they made in
the fight, and asks who this `newcomer' is.  Mulan changes her name to `Ping'
to save her identity so that she would serve in the army (but not before she
struggles for such a name; one of the film's funniest sequences).
This leads to a song, `I'll Make A Man Out Of You', where Shang teaches the
army discipline and strength, by having them tie a bronze disk to each wrist
and attempt to climb a tall pole to retrieve an arrow.  Everyone fails,
including Mulan.  Shang is ready to dismiss her, but Mulan tries one last time
by tying the disks together and using them to pull herself up the pole.  Then,
the army, inspired by Mulan's strength, works hard to improve their military
skills to be ready to confront Shan-Yu.  In doing so, Mulan makes friends with
three comic soldiersthe huge Chien-Po, the tall, skinny Ling, and the short,
gravel voiced Yao.
However, Mulan remembers to cover her true identity, especially when she goes
off to bathe in a lake.  However, her friends come along, throwing off their
clothes!  Mushu covers Mulan's disguise by diving into the water and biting
Ling.  `Snake!' Ling shouts, and they hop onto a rock while Mulan escapes,
commenting, `I never want to see naked men again!'
In the meantime, Chi-Fu, unimpressed by Shang's efforts to make a great army
out of these `boys', is prepared to make a criticizing report to the Emperor. 
Not about to let his plan go wrong, Mushu creates a fake letter to Chi Fu from
Shang's father, General Li (with the help of Cri-Kee, of course), saying that
they are needed at the front.
Chi Fu falls for it, and the next day, Shang and his troops march off to war,
singing about a `girl worth fighting for' when they encounter a burned down
village.  Among the destroyed houses and dead bodies, they find General Li's
helmetand know at once that General Li is dead!  Shang then orders the army to
make for the Imperial City by going through the Tung-Shao Pass, hoping to
arrive before the Huns do.
As they cross through the pass, however, they encounter Shan Yu and his army. 
They fire cannons at the Huns, hoping to destroy them, to no avail.  The
situation takes a turn for the worst when Shan-Yu and 10,000 Huns begin
charging down the mountainside.  Mulan defeats the army by firing the last
cannon at the mountaintop, causing an avalanche.  The wall of snow burries the
Huns and Shan-Yu, but then it comes right towards the Chinese army!  Mulan
rescues Shang from the thundering snow, who says that Mulan has his trust
because of that.
At this point, Mulan faints from a wound that she has suffered from Shan-Yu. 
She is cared for by the medic, but then, her identity is revealed!  But instead
of killing Mulan, Shang throws her sword down, repaying Mulan for saving his
life.  Then, the army leaves her in the snow and moves out.
Mulan is heartbroken, and Mushu, finally admitting that he had risked her life
to regain his position as a Guardian, suggests telling Fa Zhou the truth. 
Mulan is about to, but she hears, from the distance, that Shan-Yu and his
toughest warriors have survived the avalanche and are heading for the Imperial
City!
Mulan then decides to go to the Imperial City and warn the army.  But when she
tries to tell Shang, he refuses to listen.  When he goes up to the emperor,
presenting Shan-Yu's sword, a falcon snatches the sword and carries it back to
Shan-Yu, on the palace roof.  The Emperor is then captured, but Mulan comes up
with an idea, and convinces Ling, Yao, Chien-Po, and even Shang, to help out. 
They disguise themselves as women so that they can sneak into the palace; they
take out the guards while Shang races to save the Emperor from certain doom. 
Mulan and the others help rescue the Emperor, and she outsmarts Shan-Yu by
leading him onto the palace roof where Mushu sends a rocket careening into him.
 The rocket carries Shan-Yu to the fireworks tower, and there is a tremendous
explosion.
When all is calm, the Emperor thanks Mulan and offers to make her a part of
his council, but Mulan, having been away from home for too long, says that she
must return.  Before she leaves, the Emperor hands her his pendant `so that
your family will know what you have done for me,' he says, and the sword of
Shan-Yu, `so that the world will know what you have done for China.'
Mulan returns home to Fa Zhou, presenting the Emperor's gifts to her father,
but Fa Zhou instead says that the greatest gift and honor `is having you for a
daughter.'  Even Shang realizes how special Mulan is, because he follows her
all the way home.  Mulan invites him to stay for dinner, and he agrees;  at the
family temple, Mushu has finally regained his position as a Family Guardian.
MULAN is truly one of Disney's better animated films.  Everything about this
movie is almost quite excellent.  The artwork is authentic and beautiful, the
story dramatic and meaningful, the characters effective and well cast (They
used mostly Asian actors, except for Mushu, amusingly voiced by Eddie Murphy),
and the music is just great. 
The best scene in the whole film is where the Huns charge down the mountain
and battle our heroes.  The computer generated animation is absolutely great
and almost reminds me of the stampede scene from THE LION KING.  What I really
like about the film, though, is a lot of things.  The heroine is more, well,
heroic than most other Disney `heroines', first of all.  It's easy to
understand her emotions and feelings, especially when she is upset about the
disastrous meeting with the grouchy Matchmaker.  So when she finally saves
China from Shan-Yu and his Hun Army, it almost made me want to stand up and
cheer!  Second, I really LOVE the way Disney took advantage of the sound of
silence throughout the film.  It enhances the drama throughout the story.  For
example, in one scene, we hear silence as Mulan and her family are eating
dinner, but then the silence is broken when Mulan says `You shouldn't have to
go!' to Fa Zhou (wonderfully played by Soon-Tek Oh).  Third, there is no
romance in the story at all.  That is a smart move on Disney's part, because in
every Disney animated film (except for a few, I guess), they have just
basically told the same love story over and over and over again: here they just
give a little hint of it at the end.  Finally, I love the way the film switches
emotional gears.  One moment you feel like crying for Mulan when her identity
is revealed in front of Shang and exiled from the army, then the next thing you
know, you will find yourself laughing hysterically at Mushu's wisecracks.  This
thing has worked in THE LION KING, and here Disney has made another film
equivalent to that same film. 
The music itself is something really worth describing here. The songs by
Matthew Wilder and David Zippel aren't as memorable as those in, say, THE LION
KING, but they are above average and better than the snappy, yet unmemorable
gospel songs in HERCULES.  Some have complained that the worst song in the film
is the song over the closing credits, `True To Your Heart', saying that it is
out of character and has nothing to do with the story.  Okay, so maybe that
song doesn't have anything to do with MULAN, but it is both enjoyable and
links well to the message of the story.  You must be true to yourself.  That is
another thing I loved about MULAN, not to mention it's tear jerking ending. 
But the very best thing about the music is the underscore written by Jerry
Goldsmith.  After the unoriginal, recycled underscore from HERCULES, Goldsmith
uses his theory and powers to create an evocative landscape of China, not to
mention the exciting cue over the Hun Battle scene (WOW! What a cue!).  The
score is SO great, it's easy to forget that you are watching a Disney animated
film.  By the way, the score was nominated for an Academy Award (which was good
news for Disney, since their last animated feature, HERCULES, failed to get
nominated for Best Score, despite a Best Song nomination for `Go The
Distance').   Too bad it lost to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, though.
There are a few minor things I could criticize, such as ridiculously executed
scenes (i.e. The Huns being buried in a snow avalanche and coming out
unscathed.  Since when is this realistic?) and Mushu at first seems American,
but later on, as the film progresses, he becomes more connected with the story.
 But such criticisms seem so laughable since this is one of Disney's truly
better films. 
Overall, I enjoyed MULAN very much, having seen it six times in the theaters,
and so did many people and critics who went to see this film.  Roger Ebert
called the film `an impressive achievement ranking it up there with THE LION
KING.' and USA Today was really impressed by the whole film, due to its
beautiful artwork and a truely heroic main character.
But not everyone liked MULAN; Janet Maslin of The New York Times was not
impressed.  She condemned the film as `the most formulaic and inert of all
Disney movies raises the bar for violence of children's television.'  Excuse
me, Ms. Maslin, but who are you to say that this film raises the bar of
violence for children's television?  `The most formulaic and inert of all
Disney movies'?  I don't think so!
Even The Los Angeles Times had plenty of quibbles about this film, stating
that, though Mulan is a good female role, the story, music, and the characters
were formulaic.  Geez!  What was his problem?
As for box office receipts, the film did not get off the ground in China,
partially because people were outraged at the way Disney changed around the
character of Mulan, and of motion picture piracy that had happening in China
for quite a while.  Elsewhere, however, MULAN proved to be a bigger hit than
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and HERCULES (both which landed at $100 million
domestically), grossing over $120 million domestically.  It went on to gross
$116 million in the Non-USA, totalling the film's worldwide box office gross to
a stunning $237 million.  And so it was that MULAN proved to be the beginning
of a whole new era for the Disney studio.  It remains a modern masterpiece to
this day, and should be honored by generations to come.

Bostwick-Singer, Rita Hsiao, Phil LaZebnik, Chris Sanders & Raymond 
Singer, Story - Robert D. San Souci, Based on the Poem, Producer - Pam 
Coats, Music - Jerry Goldsmith, Songs - Matthew Wilder & David Zippel, 
Production Design - Hans Bacher. Production Company - Disney.
Voices: Ming-Na Wen (Fa Mulan), Eddie Murphy (Mushu), B.D. Wong (Captain 
Li Shang), James Hong (Chi Fu), Harvey Fierstein (Yao), Jerry Tondo 
(Chien-Pao), Gedde Watanabe (Ling), Miguel Ferrer (Shan-Yu), Soon-Tek Oh 
(Fa Zhou), Pat Morita (The Emperor), Miriam Margolyes (The Matchmaker), 
George Takei (First Ancestor)
Plot: When the Huns invade China, the emperor puts out a general 
conscription calling for one man from each family to join the army to 
repel the invasion. The aging and crippled Fa Zhou is called up. To 
spare him, his daughter Mulan cuts her hair, dresses as a man and goes 
off to join the army in his place. This defiance of tradition upsets her 
ancestors who decide she must be stopped. A demoted temple dragon goes 
to offer assistance, deciding the only way it can regain his position is 
to help her triumph against The Huns.
I may have been one of the few to have been relatively disappointed with 
the 1990s renaissance of Disney animation. Both `Beauty and the Beast' 
(1991) and `The Lion King' (1994) were impressive. But while many have 
too hastily rushed to make comparisons to the great Disney classics, 
many other recent Disney's pale in contrast. `Aladdin' (1992) was a 
bland effort only really founded on Robin Williams being a funny man; 
`Pocahontas' (1995) seemed more constructed to toe a PC line than 
actually be a film; `The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1996) failed to be 
the epic it artistically strove to be due to a flat, mawkish story; and 
`Hercules' (1997) took its in-jokey self-referentiality to the point of 
annoyance. I didn't approach `Mulan' with any great expectations and as 
a result ended up being pleasantly surprised.
`Mulan' is an adaption of a Chinese legend (although the character's 
name has been Anglicized to one word from the original's Mu Lan. While 
also in the creative embellishment stakes the invading army with some 
historical dubiousness turn out to be Huns). In some regards `Mulan' is 
like a `Pocahontas' - strong heroine stands against odds to 
single-handedly end a war - but with a stronger story and less of a 
feeling that it is tip-toeing on eggshells in order not to offend any 
minority group. Certainly the PC values are still there - despite being 
an animated film in English, it is scrupulous enough to cast most of the 
Chinese character parts with Asian-American actors - but not to the 
point it gets preachy and in the way of the story.
And in all other regards it is a satisfyingly well-rounded film - a warm 
balance of humour, a likeable obligatory supporting cast of small 
talking animal sidekicks, a strong female lead (something that is also 
requisite for the new PC Disney these days). The artwork is modelled on 
traditional Chinese lithographs and all drawn in pastel colours. While 
economically drawn, there is at least one artistically (and 
dramatically) dazzling sequence where Mulan brings an avalanche down on 
an advancing army and is forced to ride the crest of the wave on her 
horse. Amongst the characters Eddie Murphy does a standout piece as a 
fast-talking dragon. Murphy has an absolute ball and makes it the most 
memorable of the talking animal mentor/sidekick parts that Disney has 
done in recent years - far better indeed than Robin Williams's 
overrated, anachronism-spouting turn in `Aladdin'.

Disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with
the release of their latest animated adventure, Mulan.  While it adheres
a bit too close to the Disney formula to be perfect, it is nonetheless
an entertaining film for both kids and adults.
Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen, singing: Lea Salonga) wants nothing more than to
be a dutiful daughter and honor her family...it's just that she doesn't
quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time.  While most girls her
age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local
matchmaker (Miriam Margoyles), Mulan would prefer speaking her mind.
But there is trouble on the horizon.  The evil Huns, led by Shan-Yu
(Miguel Ferrer), are invading China.  The Emperor (Pat Morita) has
decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army.  The
only male in Mulan's family is her father, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh), who,
old and with a bad leg, honorably accepts his fate.  Mulan, on the other
hand, decides to save her father's life...by secretly masquerading as a
man and taking his place on the battlefield.
Mulan, under the assumed name of Ping, appears at camp where she, along
with the other bumbling recruits, Yao (Harvey Fierstein), Chien-Po
(Jerry Tondo) and Ling (Gedde Watanabe), are trained in the art of war
by Captain Shang (B.D. Wong, singing: Donny Osmond).  But she's not
alone in her tasks...in typical Disney fashion, she has three animal
companions:  her horse Khan, a lucky cricket Crickey, and a pint-sized
"guardian" dragon called Mushu (Eddie Murphy).
Much like the gargoyles in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the humor in
Mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more
serious story.  Sure, some occasional comic relief is welcome,
particularly in a film geared for the younger set, but Mulan overdoes
it.  The overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great
film into a good, but schizophrenic experience.
But, that commentary aside, this is a very well made film (which makes
the formulaic additions all the more regrettable). The animation is on
par with some of Disney's best.  The story itself is interesting, and
the action scenes are awe-inspiring.
The musical score to the film is enjoyable, though, as has been the case
with Disney's recent work, the songs are mostly forgettable. At least,
we're only subjected to four of them this time around.
Mulan boasts the highest death toll of any Disney cartoon to date. Most
of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized (there's
nothing to compare with the death of Mufasa or Bambi's mom). There's
nothing graphic, and the film resides snugly inside a G rating. Children
will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs
than of the slaughter of armies.
It's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered
because of its strict adherence to Disney tradition.  If the filmmakers
had the guts to lessen the humor, ax the compulsory songs, and remove
the obligatory (and somewhat unrealistic) romance, they could have had a
classic on their hands. Instead, they merely deliver a very good time at
the movies.

/Mulan/ is the latest offering from Disney, and for the most part, the
result is an average animation flick. Given the number of bad movies
this summer (/Godzilla/, /Hope Floats/), /Mulan/ actually may appear
better than it seems. However, compared to the greatness achieved in
previous Disney animated movies, I'd say /Mulan/ doesn't come close.
Mulan is the name of the heroine in the movie, a Chinese girl who goes
to fight in her father's place, disguised as a male.  Accompanying her
is a dragon invoked by her ancestors, Mushu (Eddie Murphy), and a
cricket, Cri Kee.  Needless to say, Disney capitalises on every
opportunity to take advantage of the fact Mulan is a female in the
world of males.  The most powerful part of the movie is how Mulan
actually makes the decision to not lead the life of a traditional
Chinese girl and take up arms instead, so her father does not have to
fight again. But once she does make the decision, she proves herself
in the army quite readily and before you know it, she's coming up with
ideas to save China from the invading Huns.  In some ways, /Mulan/ has
fallen victim to what even some of the better movies this summer have:
the plot has too much action and too little story.
As with /Armageddon/, what really works in this movie is the humour.
The animation is mixed: the backdrops and action scenes are gorgeous,
but I found the movements of the characters to be awkward.  I consider
the most spectacular scene in the movie to be the one starting with
the soldiers charging down the mountain and culminating with an
avalanche initiated by Mulan.  However, this pales in comparison to
scenes in previous Disney cartoons like the animal stampede in /The Lion
King/. The character development, particularly of the primary villain,
is minimal. This represents a marked departure from other Disney
movies where villains such as a Jafar or Scar have distinct fearsome
personalities.  The music is highly forgettable.
Parts of the film are daring and experimental by Disney standards.
Even though the movie is bold in terms of depicting a female heroine
who can do what the "big boys" can (which in itself is an incongruous
premise), in the end it all boils down to a typical
girl-hooks-up-with-boy ending.  There are plenty of disturbing scenes
that are effective particularly when animated as almost still
images. I thought one depicting the massacre left behind by the Huns
was pretty powerful, but, again, this does match up to the depiction
of the death of Simba's father in /The Lion King/.  While I do think
Disney did a positive thing by going for a somewhat experimental
structure, the fact they flop back to the cliches makes this a
somewhat schizophrenic movie and places it in the "average" category.
I recommend the matinee showing or waiting for it to come out on
video.

The second of this year's two leading-female animated motion pictures
(besides the in-the-rough QUEST FOR CAMELOT), and the third of the last
three (counting 1997's ANASTASIA), MULAN was an animated picture that
had, perhaps, a bit to live up to. Although those last two pictures
weren't really a benchmark, they were a trend, and Disney was charged
with distancing themselves from "normal" fare. Not only that, but as
soon as previews and advance showings began filtering down through the
ranks of the critics, MULAN was hailed as the best Disney animation
since THE LION KING. And while this one isn't as enjoyable as the
African epic of 1994, it is probably the best animated movie since then. 
Disney's animated films have progressively become more refined from the
typical children's movies - ones adults hate to see in theaters because
they know the same films will infest their VCRs like parasites after
release on videocasette - to complete crowd-pleasers. In addition to the
easily-gotten under-12 demographic, Disney has nailed the
too-cool-to-care date crowd, the Gen-Xers, and the middle-aged chaperone
folks. They've done this through clever writing and a well-manicured
storytelling style, all of which is very present in MULAN. From the
opening scene, a rather dark and ominous one showing the Huns invading
China, to the pastel-colored plates of lowland Asia, this movie is
crafted very nicely. The animation quality here, although not
outstandingly different from Disney's last feature, Hercules, is the
up-to-snuff look we've come to expect from the original animators. 
Early on it was made clear that even though MULAN sported a female in
the lead role, this would be no SNOW WHITE. And indeed it's not, as the
main woman here - the 18-year-old Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen) - cuts
her hair, puts on some battle armor, and enlists into the Imperial Army
as a boy to save her ailing father from having to serve. She does this,
of course, against every societal convention in place at the time, but
she oes it quite well - managing to become a national hero after all but
saving China from the evil-doing Huns. Along for the ride is a tiny
dragon sent by Mulan's ancestors. Named Mushu and voiced by Eddie
Murphy, he's the movie's main comic relief source, and for the most part
he does it well. Murphy's also one of the only familiar names in the
cast (apart from Harvey Fierstein, who voices a stout soilder but also
played the quivering news chief in INDEPENDENCE DAY). 
The lack of familiar names was spun as good for the movie, but it may
cost the movie some box office dollars in comparison to PRINCE OF EGYPT,
the later-this-year animated film from DreamWorks. That film sports the
largest collection of big names since THE LION KING, and one of the most
enjoyable aspects of that movie was hearing A-list actors do what they
could with just their voices. Normally something Disney would not have
to worry about, they now are - or will be soon - in direct competition
with other studios' animated features. Up to this point, they've had the
top call; no one's been able to challenge them. But it won't be long
before the other studios pick up speed, and then Disney will need all
the MULANs they can get.
FINAL AWARD FOR "MULAN": 3.0 stars - a good movie.

It had seemed to me that the folks at Disney had a rather interesting pattern developing in their feature animation department. Every other year produced a good film. Since 1989, Disney Animation has (with the exception of 1993) produced a full-length feature. The Little Mermaid was superior to the following year's Rescuers Down Under. Beauty and the Beast was far better than Aladdin. Lion King vs. Pocahontas and the solid Hunchback over the stylish but silly Hercules. Mulan, Disney's latest feature has broken the pattern. 
Mulan is Hercules in so many ways. A scrawny young character musters up the courage, with the aid of a loud mouth dinky sidekick, to put evil-doers in their place. Add crossdressing to Hercules and make the unique Hades into a cookie-cutter boring villain and you have Mulan.
Mulan tells the story of a young Chinese woman (Mulan) who takes her father's place in the Chinese army so that she may save him from certain death. There are the usual gender change jokes and circumstances. Sadly, nothing creative is done with it. Strange that there were no snickers, though, from children in the audience when one character bared himself to his fellow soldiers and proclaimed that he was "the rock".
The central message in Mulan is a good one for children. Women can do what men can do and perhaps even better. But the Mulan character tends to do it the messy way. She gets the job done, but not without destroying everything in the area. So the message is muddled. She also goes from weakling to superior soldier in the space of one abrupt and annoying song. That one is also not a terribly clear message to children. What is it supposed to tell them, that success comes overnight if you just WANT it?
And then there are the sidekicks. You are familiar with them. In the past they have been clever as meerkats and raccoons, failures as yellow fish and monkeys. The folks at Disney created yet another loud and outlandish character whose sole asset is the person who provides the voice. Eddie Murphy is the mini-dragon Mushu who tricks the spirits and sets off to provide Mulan with support and help. With him he brings the slightly more clever cricket who provides almost as much humor withought speech as Murphy does with it. The only amusing moments in the film (and they are few and far between, at least for adults) do come with either the cricket or Mushu, but the dragon is merely a vehicle who fits well into the role of Disney sidekick. The writers and animators seem desperate to find another "Timon" and have as yet been unable to do so.
There are some moments of Disney magic to be found in Mulan. Primarily it is the battle scene in the snow, the formulaic middle plot point that is supposed to turn the story around. The digital effects do help in this instance and make for quite an awesome sight. There is also a clever little element added to clouds, smoke, water and snow, any thing that flows, really. The swirls, waves and puffs all have an asian accent, they twist and curve as they do in ancient Chinese paintings and it is quite a nice touch.
One would hope that the Character Animators at Disney have not forgotten how to create pretty characters. Everyone in Mulan looks like a Pocahontas extra. Square or pointy faces, sharply angled black hair, plain, black eyes. There is no depth to any of them, save for what the computer coloring can add. The production designers also went back and forth between Chinese and Japanese designs. Much of the picture had the rigid and simple beauty of Japanese culture invading the image,  and not much of the intricate Chinese detail.
What I suggest to Disney (as if they would listen) is to take a year off. The pictures they are producing now are falling back into the creativity-draining trap that only attracts children. It was magical when they made Beauty and the Beast and allowed adults some enjoyment for the next few pictures, both in theme and in art. But now, they have failed two years in a row and seem destined to do it for a third if they continue to be an animation factory rather than artists. The world did not end in 1993 withought a summer Disney blockbuster. And that hiatus allowed them to create the highest grossing Disney film of all time, The Lion King. I'm sure that the money from that picture more than made up for missing a year. The quality of these films would approve all around if they let the pencils rest and came back with a masterpiece to kick off the millenium. Because only Disney can do it.

     Perhaps, for the first time in a decade, the pressure is off.  Ever
since THE LITTLE MERMAID re-vitalized Disney's animation efforts in 1989,
the studio's annual animated feature has been one of the year's most
scrutinized releases.  After steadily increasing grosses from BEAUTY AND
THE BEAST and ALADDIN, the stakes were raised even higher when THE LION
KING became a $300 million blockbuster.  Then came POCAHONTAS, THE 
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and HERCULES, which made "only" $350 million
between them, leading wags to wonder whether the Mouse had lost its touch.
They'd gotten too "politically correct," came the analysis, or too dark.
They'd strayed from the successful formulas which had filled the seats
with youngsters and sent tie-in products scurrying off the shelves.
     Now that no one expects $300 million every time out of the gate,
maybe Disney will get the credit it is due for pushing the limits of 
animated film-making.  MULAN defies convention yet again, bypassing the
well-trodden ground of Western literature and mythology to tell a
2,000-year-old tale from Chinese legend.  The title character (Ming-Na
Wen) is a less-than-demure young girl who seems destined for an uncertain
place in Imperial Chinese society when she fails the tests of the local
matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes). Then the empire is threatened by an
invading Hun army led by Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), leading the emperor (Pat
Morita) to call on every family to provide one male for military service.
With her aging, lame father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) as the only male family
member, Mulan decides to honor her family in a different way by disguising
herself as a man and joining the army.  Accompanied by a disgraced,
redemption-hungry dragon guardian named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan sets
out to find her destiny in battle, and perhaps fall for her commanding
officer Li Shang (B. D. Wong) along the way.
     The "YENTL goes to China" plot line is basic Disney stuff on a 
certain level -- yearning young protagonist, societal restrictions,
complicated romance, lessons in personal growth and tolerance of
individuality all around.  It's a bit surprising then to find the set-up
as drawn-out as it is in MULAN.  Though there's a bit of comic relief in
the bumbling encounter with the matchmaker, the first half hour is largely
devoted to character development and motivation -- good things on general
principle, of course, but over-indulged here to contribute to an extremely
slow start.  It doesn't help that the early songs by David Zippel and
Matthew Wilder -- yes, the same Matthew Wilder of "Break My Stride" fame
-- are the kind of uninspired post-Howard Ashman ditties which make you
wish someone could get over the Broadway musical paradigm for animated
features.  That opening 25-minute stretch is plenty earnest, but it's
hardly confidence-inspiring.
     When MULAN finally does hit its own stride, beginning with the
visually striking sequence in which Mulan leaves home, it's a solid and
energetic piece of work.  The script incorporates comic relief into its
redemption story much better than POCAHONTAS or HUNCHBACK wedged in its
token gags, providing a fine showcase for Eddie Murphy's fast-talking
dragon and Harvey Fierstein's entertainingly incongruous voicing of a
he-man soldier.  The musical numbers also pick up steam in the second half
of the film, perhaps not providing break-out hummable hits but at least
setting a firm musical tone.  Mostly, however, the film becomes a dazzling
adventure, highlighted by a spectacular battle sequence between Huns and
Chinese soldiers in a snowy mountain pass.  By the time the sharply-paced
climactic confrontation rolls around, with its balanced doses of humor and
suspense, you may have forgotten MULAN's less-than-stellar start.
    I suppose what gives MULAN an added kick are the touches which stray
from familiar Disney patterns.  Notably, the villainous Shan-Yu remains in
the background for most of the film as a mysterious genuine threat -- no
comic sidekicks, no songs, no glib one-liners.  That leaves more time to
develop Mulan's resourcefulness, creating a smart and savvy heroine who
happens to be an Asian woman, a rarity not just in animated films but in
films of any kind.  This may not be the kind of cuddly, inviting film of
which stuffed animal sales and video buying binges are made; indeed, it
may be over the head of kids much younger than 7 or 8.  Fact is, it
doesn't exactly warrant that ubiquitous Disney label of "masterpiece."
Sometimes you're going to take a few false steps when you make a choice
not merely to follow the old steps.

Disney makes good animated features, but once in a long while Disney will
create a great animated feature. Mulan fits into the latter category.
There's nothing to criticize Mulan about, so this Don't Miss film will get
a shorter review than most films. 
The animation for Mulan is stunning, to say the least. It's a mix of highly
detailed backgrounds, computer generated special effects, and
simplified-yet-detailed characters all blended to give a sense of grandeur.
The main characters are all well done.
Mulan is an ancient Chinese tale about a young woman who takes her father's
place in the Imperial army. Mulan's father is old, fragile, and has a bad
leg - he is also the only man in the Fa family. The Imperial army is in
need of more men to fight the incoming Huns; each family from each village,
by the order of the Emperor of China, will send one man to fight for the army.
Mulan's father had already fought in one war and Mulan sees no reason that
he should go fight again. So, late one night Mulan cuts her hair, steals
her father's armor, and goes off to join the army for the Fa family.
Protecting Mulan is Mushu, a small dragon who is trying to prove himself to
the spirits of the Fa family.
Ming-Na Wen (One Night Stand, The Joy Luck Club) is the voice talent for
the character Mulan. Wen does a wonderful job with Mulan. The voice I loved
the most was Eddie Murphy's Mushu the dragon, and he is hilarious. Murphy's
Mushu is to Mulan what Robin William's Genie was to Aladdin. 
With Disney animated features it's not just the animation that counts, it's
also the music. With the score done by Jerry Goldsmith and the lyrics by
Matthew Wilder, Mulan is one of the best sounding Disney features. I liked
Hercules, but Mulan beats Hercules by a long shot. 
One thing I'd like to mention. At first when I saw the previews for Mulan,
I thought that Disney had messed up and not studied up enough for the
costumes. I wondered, "Why are all the Chinese people dressed like that?
Why are they dressed in Japanese-like kimonos?" I found out later from my
mom that Disney had done their homework and the costumes were consistent
with the period.
Let's not forget why Disney's animated features are so popular; they are
written on two levels one for children and one for adults. For children,
Mulan is the perfect film. It's funny and it has cute characters (including
Mushu the dragon, a cool horse, a funny dog, and a cricket.) For the
adults, Mulan has a story rich enough with well-written characters and
action that will entertain you for its full running time.
Kudos to the handful of writers for putting together a wonderfully
entertaining film with enough laughs to keep us interested - but also well
developed and emotional characters to round out the film.
Don't Miss Mulan. This is the best Disney animated feature since The Lion
King. Mulan is not just for kids either, adults can go and enjoy a
well-written and funny movie.

     My concept of a "family film" is a movie that can be enjoyed by 
viewers of all ages:  undiscriminating young children, teenagers with 
short attention spans, and adults with somewhat more refined standards.  
Unfortunately, too often Hollywood equates a "family film" with 
something aimed at the under-10 crowd.  While Disney's live-action 
pictures have often fallen victim to this approach, the corporation's 
animated features have remained largely exempt (although it's possible 
to argue about how widespread HERCULES' appeal is).  MULAN, Disney's 
36th animated movie, continues this trend.  Arguably the most mature of 
the eight "new wave" (post-1988, beginning with THE LITTLE MERMAID) 
films, MULAN effortlessly blends serious, comic, and cute elements into 
a whole that should entertain the majority of movie-goers, regardless of 
race, gender, or age.
     Over the past few years, the Disney animated films have been in a 
state of constant quality erosion.  This slippage has left the door open 
for other production companies' challengers, such as Fox's ANASTASIA, 
which applied the Disney formula with greater success than was evident 
in the Mouse's recent entries.  MULAN not only reverses this unfortunate 
tendency, but re-affirms Disney as Hollywood's premiere animation 
factory.  MULAN is better than either ANASTASIA or the disappointing THE 
QUEST FOR CAMELOT, and represents the most impressive animated offering 
since THE LION KING.  Adults will appreciate the depth of 
characterization while kids will love Mulan's sidekick, a colorful 
dragon named Mushu.  Everyone will be entertained the fast-moving plot 
and rich animation.
     The setting for this latest adventure is feudal China.  An army of 
Huns under the command of the ruthless Shan-Yu (voice of Miguel Ferrer), 
has invaded the country, spreading death and disaster far and wide.  The 
Chinese Emperor (Pat Morita) commands that one able-bodied male from 
every family must serve in an emergency army.  Meanwhile, in a remote 
village, an independent-minded young woman named Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) has 
been rejected by a local matchmaker on the grounds that she is too 
willful.  "You will never bring your family honor," decrees the 
matchmaker, causing Mulan to begin a period of soul-searching. When the 
Emperor's decree arrives, Mulan cuts her hair, dresses like a man, and 
enters the army in her father's place.  With the help of her inept 
mythical guardian, the tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy), she seeks to 
win the confidence of her captain, Li Shang (B.D. Wong), and the 
acceptance of her fellow peasant-turned-warriors, while keeping her sex 
concealed from everyone.
     MULAN is the first Disney animated film to deal with war and death 
on a large scale.  The subject is not glossed over  the movie features 
several poignant sequences showing the devastation in the aftermath of a 
battle, including hundreds of lifeless bodies lying in the snow.  Oddly, 
because there's nothing exploitative or gruesome about these images, 
they're more likely to affect older viewers, who will better understand 
the implications, than younger ones, for whom death is often a nebulous 
concept.  In no way can it be said that MULAN is glorifying war.
     The main character is cut from a familiar cloth.  Although she 
looks different from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan is 
very much the same type of individual:  a woman with a strong, 
independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her 
culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental.  
The film isn't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between 
the sexes, but the script contains a few amusing lines in this vein that 
will fly high over the heads of younger viewers. 
     As all Disney movies must, MULAN features a pair of new sidekicks.  
One, the second best-known cartoon cricket in the history of motion 
pictures, doesn't have a voice.  The other, Mushu, never shuts up.  It's 
clear that, in his vocal characterization of the dragon, Eddie Murphy is 
trying to top (or at least equal) Robin Williams' genie from ALADDIN.  
Amazingly, he comes close.  With his high-energy, often hilarious 
delivery (I'd bet money there was more than a little improvisation 
involved), Murphy flies away with his scenes.  Mushu is the primary 
reason kids will love MULAN, and he's not so fundamentally juvenile that 
adults won't get a few chuckles out of him, as well.
     If there's a disappointment in MULAN, it's the villain.  Shan-Yu is 
not going to place high in the Disney Bad Guys Hall of Fame.  The 
problem isn't that he's not nasty, because, with his scowling features, 
glaring eyes, and Darth Vader-like mannerisms, he's one of the most 
vicious men ever to appear in a Disney animated feature.  Rather, it's 
his lack of screen time.  Shan-Yu isn't around long enough for audiences 
to truly hate him.  The final showdown is anti-climactic because he 
seems more like an afterthought than a major player.
     Unsurprisingly, the animation is top-notch.  The film has a unique 
look for an animated motion picture, using many more unusual camera 
angles than have previously been attempted in this kind of effort.  
There are the typically spectacular sequences:  the opening shot of the 
Great Wall of China, scenes of a charging army, and the sight of a 
village in blazing ruins.  In addition, the artists conquered an unusual 
challenge  to change the appearance of a cartoon character so that she 
looks like a male but is still obviously the same (female) person.  
     MULAN doesn't rely upon occasional double entendres to earn its 
acceptance with adults.  Some of the dialogue is specifically aimed at 
an older audience.  There's not so much that children will become 
confused or bored, but there's enough for Mom and Dad not to feel like 
they're being ignored or talked down to.  It's also worth noting that 
MULAN is surprisingly light on songs, featuring only four or five 
(depending on how you count).  Written by the team of Matthew Wilder and 
David Zippel, these are an improvement over what we were subject to in 
POCAHONTAS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and HERCULES.  
     After several years of less-than-stellar entries, Disney has 
rebounded with MULAN, which once again raises the bar for animated 
quality.  Now, if only the production company would apply the same 
effort to their live-action features.  Then I might not cringe at the 
thought of reviewing any non-animated offering from the Magic Kingdom.
Now with more than 1400 reviews...

One hears and reads opinions and statistics about Walt Disney Pictures.  
THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) was a watershed film, recharging the animation 
division.  THE LION KING (1994) grossed over $300 million.  The entries 
of the last two summers, however, disappointed both critics and Disney's 
money-counters.
There's no telling yet about MULAN'S box office, but for my money it's 
the best entry since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991).  
The legend on which the story is based is a masterful choice.  It avoids 
familiar, sexist lore;  it stresses the strengths and determination of a 
young heroine;  it even goes out of its way to avoid the formulaic 
treacle typical of Disney.
Though the narrative begins with action  a herd of Huns overrunning the 
Great Wall  it spends the next several minutes exposing and developing 
characters.  We meet minor figures like Mulan's grandmother, and the 
family dog "Little Brother," both of whom are used for comic relief.  
There is also a little cricket:  it's no Jiminy, but it does have a mute 
charm akin to the dog-like carpet's in ALADDIN.  But the character that 
casts his influence upon the rest of the film is Zhou, Mulan's father.
An aging, dignified and prayerful man, Zhou receives a conscription 
notice send by the Emperor .  One male from each family must fight the 
invading hordes.  Observing her father's ineffectual attempt to swing 
his long-closeted sword, Mulan makes the crucial decision of the film's 
premise.  She cuts off her hair, dons her father's armor, gallops off on 
her black stallion, Khan.  Zhou charges out of the house and falls in a 
rain puddle, horrified, of course, at his daughter's smashing of 
tradition and honor.  Voiced expertly by Soon-Tek Oh, Zhou appears again 
only briefly, at the far end of the tale;  but he proves to be a 
quick-forgiving father, causing many tears to spill, I am sure, from 
viewers' eyes.
Another laudable aspect of the film is that its characters are drawn 
consistently.  Way back when Snow White and her Prince moved with the 
grace of their human models, while the dwarves cavorted like the 
buffoonish caricatures they were, we witnessed the gap Disney pictures' 
animation style.  Look at Cinderella versus her step-sisters, even at 
Belle and her eccentric, barrel-like father.  No, the plain beauty of 
Mulan does not contrast strongly with the supporting roles.  Captain Li 
Shang (voice of B. D. Wong), Mulan's would-be love interest, does not 
differ strikingly from the other males in the story.  The Huns are an 
exception;  they are demonized through lack of development and through 
Neanderthal bulkiness.  Miguel Ferrer, in his role of Shan-Yu, creates 
the most velvety and threatening male voice since Robbie Benson's Beast.
MULAN is strongest in the story of its heroine's quest.  Although the 
film is too short to be considered picaresque in nature, we watch Mulan 
meet and conquer many obstacles, from training to rejection as a 
meddlesome female.  She is certainly a dynamic character, a strong woman 
who does not spend her time waiting to be rescued.  Instead, she 
conceives the rescue schemes.  
I find it remarkable that MULAN can be criticized as though it were a 
live-action drama.  I was so caught up in the exposition that, when 
Eddie Murphy's dragon, the strutting sidekick Mushu, appeared, I felt a 
disturbing change in tone.  Then I remembered the audience.  This was a 
kids' picture that adults could enjoy too.  Along with Mushu, I admired 
the portrayal of Mulan's ancestors.  George Takei does nicely as Number 
1 Ancestor.  He leads a cast of ghosts that tells us a great deal about 
Chinese tradition.  A film 88 minutes long cannot do justice to such a 
culture;  however, we spy customs, dress, art and even some musical cues 
that serve as a thorough short course on that time.
Watching some scenes in MULAN  specifically the ones aided by computer 
digitalization  I was reminded of the racing introduction of THE 
RESCUERS DOWN UNDER and the dancing scene of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  When 
Shan-Yu appeared atop a snow-covered hill,  the horizon high in the shot 
to show the immense width of the landscape, I experienced the awe 
induced usually by the cinematography of war epics.  And when the Hun 
leader and his legions of mounted warriors commenced to cascade down the 
snow-covered mountain, I felt the slight but pleasurable vertigo evoked 
by carefully-placed cameras.  This animation is indeed top-notch.
The music accomplishes the main task of songs that appear in musicals:  
their lyrics further the plot.  That's all.  The numbers are not bad, 
just unremarkable.  I doubt even the Stevie Wonder song that accompanies 
the credits will receive much play on the radio.  
In future viewings  my daughter has already asserted that we will 
purchase the video  I will try to spot the twisted humor of animators, 
jokes like "SEX" spelled out in the dust and blown leaves of THE LION 
KING.  The silliest gag I noticed is the casting of Harvey Fierstein as 
a macho soldier who asks, late in the film, if his dress makes him look 
fat!
Because of Fu Zhou and his loving relationship with his daughter, it was 
all the more pleasant to catch MULAN on Father's Day weekend, its 
opening date.  My family was thankful for a G-rated film as summer 
began.  I understand other studios have noticed the scarcity of good 
family entertainment too.  But with MULAN, the best of Disney is back.

The test goes a little something like this-
   Go up to a female friend, wife, sister, etc. and say (if you are
female pretend I'm saying this to you):  "I was watching a movie on
cable last night...Man, that Sharon Stone is so hot! Don't you think
so?"...then turn your head and brace for your test subject's
reply. The most polite response she's likely to give is a grimace while
audibly rolling her eyes. I'd wager that most of you (feamle)
bristled from just reading the test statement.
    One might hastily conclude from this test that all women are catty
and incapable of paying each other a compliment. You would be
incorrect. If you were to repeat the test statement and in place of
"Sharon Stone" use "Julianna Margulies" or "Emma Thompson"
you'll find you get an almost opposite reaction. You may even be
applauded and perceived as a higher thinker.
   It's not that women don't compliment other women...just certain
women.  Julianna and Emma happen to fall on the sanctioned'
A-list. These are women who present themselves as smart, heroic, demure
and...well, nonthreatening. Sure, Sharon Stone (as well as
Demi Moore) has made great strides in getting higher salaries for women
in Hollywood and she was lauded by critics for her
performances in CASINO and LAST DANCE...still, there's that threatening/
nonthreatening thing. See, a common thread of the A-list
women is that while men may find most of them attractive none of them
are really considered to be "HOT".
    This has been a sneak preview of my next career venture. Along with
being a multimedia artist and movie critic I'm going to tour
the country on the seminar circuit. Following in the footsteps of Dr.
John Gray I'm going to further polarize the sexes by pontificating
on the differences between men and woman, however, my focus will be a
little different.
    From talking to alot of women I've come to realize that they can't
or don't see the reality of what men, ALL MEN,  truly are. This
"dampening" effect, I believe, is biological and no different than the
function that erases the memory of the pain of childbirth. My
teachings are not aimed at demonizing male behavior but pointing out
that it's perceived crudeness is the result of biological
hardwiring, which is centered around sex and killing stuff. It is a
constant struggle between instinct and the prime directive: The
continuation of a society and propagation of the species.
    Of course, I'll also cover "Why your man couldn't care less about
meeting your friends" and other long kept secrets- but for that
and the rest you'll have to come hear me speak in the Ranchero room of
your local Marriott or Red Lion and buy a $99 set of tapes.
    Well, anyway, I got to thinking about all of this while watching the
reaction of MULAN when  she enters the Chinese army training
camp and discovers the true behavior of men when comfortably immersed in
their natural element.
    Since the marketing blitz has only been half that of HERCULES, you
may not know that MULAN is the newest animated featured
offered by Disney. It is the story of a young woman, Mulan (Ming Na
Wen), who is too much of a tomboy and free spirit to marry
off, thus bringing honor to her long-suffering family. When the Huns
invade China the emperor calls for a male from every household
to join the army. To spare her crippled father Mulan steals his armor,
disguises herself as a man and joins the Chinese army- knowing
that if she is found out she will be executed.
    By now we're all familiar with the clocksetting  formula Disney uses
for it's movies so I think I can anticipate most of your
questions.  Let me start out by saying that nothing in MULAN is
extraordinary or even amazing, but there is alot that's very good.
    One of the best things about MULAN is how understated it is. While
HERCULES was as boisterous and boastful as Herakles
himself, MULAN is much quieter and asks you to expect no more than it's
willing to deliver. Have you noticed the absence of Happy
Meal toys and the lack of commercials for it? The tone of MULAN is
softer right down to its watercolor-like palette. The art is
reminiscent of Chinese prints without being daring enough to let you
forget that it's a Disney cartoon.
    Another thing in its favor is that unlike HERCULES, HUNCHBACK OF
NOTRE DAME, POCAHONTAS, or even ALADDIN it is an
original story with no literary or historical base to "piss" all over.
    If there's anything in MULAN that comes close to being amazing it's
how well they handled the characters. Especially the
supporting and background characters which are the best since ALADDIN.
They are all distinctive and ,except for Yao (who is
basically REN & STIMPY's George Liquor with a beard) very Chinese
without being racially insulting- In other words, no Jerry Lewis
clones here.
    The obligatory ,annoying, comic-relief characters are kept to a
minimum. Namely, Mushu the
Dragon, as voiced by Eddie Murphy. Murphy does an excellent job and
Mushu is a pretty good character, but he's on the set of the
wrong movie. Even though the anachronistic humor has a much lower
profile than in most Disney movies, MULAN is so deep in
ancient Chinese culture that it wasn't until halfway through the picture
that I got used to Mushu.
    The character I was probably most impressed with was the General's
son, Li-Shang. Whereas Hercules was about as Greek as a
McGyro, Li-Shang is the most ethnic looking stud/ love interest Disney
has ever done. It was good to see a character that was
handsome, proud, and every bit Chinese...except for his singing voice.
   Li-Shang is voiced by B.D.Wong, until a very important scene when he
opens his mouth to sing and the most Anglo voice
imaginable comes out of it.  The voice belongs to Donnie Osmond- and I'm
not speaking metaphorically, it really is DONNIE "whiter
than an albino mime" OSMOND!  It's very jarring and doesn't help that
the song is not all that good either.
       Well, you knew you couldn't escape one of these without suffering
through a few psuedo- show tunes. Replacing the usual
composer "Broadway" Tim Rice is "one-hit-wonder" Matthew Wilder. If that
name sounds familiar to you turn on your radio to
K-LITE and you're likely to hear him belting out: "Ain't nuthin' gonna
break-a my stride...".  The songs in MULAN leave you
wondering, not "where did he disappear to?" but "who thought it was a
good idea to find him?".  On the positive side,  MULAN has the
fewest songs of any of the others (maybe 4) and the score is nice.
     As for the story, it's very simple and predictable, yet enjoyment.
Though it centers around the gender conflicts and honor, it is
mostly a story of empowerment. A must-see for little girls and a
should-see for little boys. I couldn't help but make comparisons to
G.I. JANE. Unfortunately, it also borrowed the one thing from G.I. JANE
that I didn't like.
    As both movies seem to be settling into very low key but poignant
endings, they tack on a poorly-conceived action sequence. It's as
if the investors had a meeting and decided that their targeted audience
wouldn't be happy without it. In the case of MULAN it may
have also been a matter of trying to stretch out the time. Oh well, it
is a kid's movie.
    And YES, it IS a kid's movie! For all of you parents who felt burned
by THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, you can go back
into the water.  I assure you that MULAN is safe. About the most
uncomfortable question you'll have to answer is, "Do the Chinese
really such a low threshold for embarrassment?"
BTW- There is a male counterpart to that test question
 Casually say to your brother, friend, male co-worker, etc.: "I think
George Michael is sooo hot! I can't believe people think he's gay."

Based on an old Chinese folktale, this movie becomes Disney's 36th
animated feature, and its best since THE LION KING back in 1994.
PLOT:
The Huns have invaded China. One man from every Chinese family must
join the Army and serve in the country's defense. Recognizing that her
father is very old and incapable of effective combat duty, Mulan chops
her hair into a boy-cut, and pretends to be a man, so that she can take
her father's place in the war. She does effectively join the troops,
and fight for the honour of her father, her country and herself.
CRITIQUE:
Funny, interesting, and mostly entertaining animated Disney feature
made for the marketing summer of 1998. Having gone in with little
expectations, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to find many
humorous moments in this animated fable, along with some pretty cool
action sequences, and an interesting lead character in Mulan. Of
course, it goes without saying that the real star of this film wasn't
Mulan, but the tiny disgraced dragon Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy.
This little creature managed to get a crack out of the audience during
every single one of its wonderful appearances on the big screen.
Reminded me a little of the "young" Murphy on Saturday Night Live,
before he got all pretty and serious (Surely, many of the lines in this
film were ad-libbed by Murphy himself.). 
The story of this film was also very interesting to absorb, seeing that
it went within a culture that I knew very little about (Mind you, I
really have no idea how accurate this film's facts are, but still...).
The animation was also very well done, especially during the winter
scenes in the mountains, which really looked like the real deal. On the
down side, I guess that the songs in this movie could be considered its
weakest link, but then again, I've never been much of a musical guy
anyway, so that didn't bother me too much. 
Overall, I would say this movie was a touch better than HERCULES
(6.5/10), and just about as good as the unexpectedly decent ANASTASIA
(7/10), but on a much funnier level, thanks mostly to the wonderful
talents of Eddie Murphy. Kids will love it (As loudly expressed in the
theater that I attended with Mrs. JoBlo), and most adults should also
enjoy it. The cinema or video question is one that I would just as soon
leave in your hands considering that I don't know of everyone's
financial situation. But if the movie sounds interesting enough to you,
or your lover's begging you to take her/him, by all means, go ahead and
see it on the big screen. It's fun and genuinely harmless (At 88
minutes run-time...how could you go wrong?)
Little Known Facts: 
Two of this film's previous titles were CHINA DOLL and THE LEGEND OF
MULAN.
Ming-Na Wen also starred in ONE NIGHT STAND (5/10) opposite Wesley
Snipes.
Lea Salonga does the voice of Mulan singing in this movie, as Donny
Osmond does the voice of Shang belting out the tunes.

In one of the most politically correct Disney movies to date, we have a
female saving China in an era when male chauvinistic pigs dominated the
continent  and they still do! This is the tale of a legendary Chinese
heroine, Mulan, a folk tale of courage and honour handed down by mouth
over centuries. It is the time when China stands on the brink of
disaster, and the threat isn't the Japanese. The Huns of Mongols are
about to invade China from the north, and not even The Great Wall can
keep these big, hairy barbarians out.
A royal decree is issued by the Emperor, summoning a male from every
family to stand and defend the country against the Huns. Mulan's father
is crippled in the last war and like any strong-willed, progressive
thinking, independent female, Mulan decides she can take her father's
place by acting the man - and she does a great job! In fact Mulan looks
outright ugly as a girl, but when she cuts her hair and throws on the
manly garb - she blossoms into one of the spunkiest looking young studs
this side of the divide. Don't get the wrong idea, this isn't just a
story about cross-dressing - there's ALSO romance. The love interest is
none other that the general's son, Captain Shang who has been ordered to
train the recruits. Shang has an annoying tendency to bear his muscles
every opportunity he gets in front of a very flat chested Mulan. This
actually generates a buried sexual tension that erupts in the end when
Mulan not only saves China, but also the hunky Shang. When she is
wounded the secret is out, but how does a man brought up on the
traditionalist views of a male domineering society take to being saved
by a woman?
Hearing Donny Osmond sing, will bring tears to your eyes - and it's not
because he can sing. Lea Salonga is the leading Asian girl of Broadway,
and would have easily snared the singing part of Mulan with little
difficulty, if not due to lack of competition. As for the speaking
voices, Ming-Na Wen of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and THE SINGLE GUY, is ideal as
the spirited Mulan. Eddie Murphy generates a lot of the laughs as Mushu
the family dragon  somehow hearing him is easier than watching him.
If this movie doesn't make a father proud of his daughter, I'm not sure
what will. If only the boys of this day and age had more of the
character and initiative shown by MULAN, the world would be a better
place. Great family viewing.

        There's good news and bad news about MULAN. The positive is 
that Disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness 
of POCAHONTAS and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and the 
childishness of HERCULES. On the other hand, the studio is pulling 
out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs, several steps down 
from the days of THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. But 
MULAN is a step in the right direction and Disney's best animated 
feature since THE LION KING.
        After giving Native Americans a turn in POCAHONTAS, Disney 
has decided to turn a movie over to the Asians. MULAN is set in feudal 
China and features the ever-popular Heroine Who Marches To A 
Different Drum And Wants To Do More With Her Life Than Get 
Married. That's what we find out when young Mulan (voice of Ming-
Na Wen) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a 
rogue cricket splash coffee all over her. Cartoons...
        Meanwhile, word comes from the emporer that one man from 
every family must join the army and help fight the Huns. Since 
Mulan's a girl, that means her decrepit old father must go. She pleads 
with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old Dad, but that kind of 
groveling and desperation brings shame on her family. That's Chinese 
culture for you... So imagine how embarrassed the family is the next 
day when they find Mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword 
and run off to join the army in his place. The movie in a nutshell is 
about the stuggles of being a woman in the army. It should have been 
called G.I. CHANG.
        Mulan calls on her ancestors for help. They decide to 
summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her, but a 
mini dragon named Mushu screws it up. Voiced by Eddie Murphy, 
Mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do 
more slapstick harm than good for their human charges. Murphy's 
performance is a direct descendent of Robin Williams in ALADDIN -- 
lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about 
how much fun they're going to have. You ain't never had a friend like 
Mushu.
        Speaking of songs, MULAN doesn't have too many of them, 
which is a plus with a story like this. Disney songs about war probably 
wouldn't go over too well ("Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to war I go..."), 
and the ones they do have aren't memorable. The best of the bunch, 
sad to say, is "Be a Man," the requisite Basic Training Montage song. 
Yes, even in medieval China, they had to run through that web of car 
tires before they were ready for battle. Sung by Donnie Osmond (a bad 
sign if ever there was one), "Be a Man" accompanies footage of 
Mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes. It makes me wonder, 
has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly? I 
only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a 
peppy montage.
        For the curious, Mulan does pass for a man in the army 
despite looking like a girl. All she does to transform herself is cut her 
hair to a sexy shoulder-length, talk macho and slap guys on the butt, 
as was male custom a thousand years ago in China. The deception 
fools everyone but the audience, who thinks she might be able to pass 
for a 12-year-old boy, at best. But she does manage to strike the 
biggest blows to the Hun army, led by a big, evil-eyed Attilla-looking 
monster. As a villain, the head of the Huns is menacing, evil and 
entirely forgettable. I saw the movie yesterday and I don't remember 
the man's name.
        Otherwise, MULAN is a good movie. The animation of the 
characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be, but there 
are some amazing battlefield shots. Eddie Murphy pulls off some good 
one-liners, as do other star voices like Harvey Fierstein and Pat 
Morita, the quintessential Asian movie star. Hell, George "Mr. Sulu" 
Takei does a voice in MULAN. You get the sense Disney said to 
themselves, "Alright, let's get out there and find us some Chinese 
Americans in Hollywood. Who can you think of?" "Well, there's Mr. 
Myagi..." "Good." "And Mr. Sulu." "Perfect. We've got ourselves a 
movie now." Soon Disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the 
colors of the wind.

With the exception of the unforgettable FANTASIA, there has been nothing in
the field of animation to compare with Disney's MULAN.   The graphics were
absolutely captivating.   The battle scenes, the spears and arrows in the
air, the city below, the snow,   the crowd of 2,000 Huns on horseback,
7.000 lanterns, a crowd of 30,000. . .  everything with perfection.
Then there is the wonderful story, in fact a great poem, (which originated
during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD) that the Chinese have been
relating to their children for some 2000 years so that everyone in China is
as familiar with the story as we here are with Pocohantas.   The original
great poem begins with the sound of a loom, "Zhi-zhi, zhi-zhi."  The poem's
story over the many years of telling have resulted in many versions.    It
should be noted that unlike the MULAN film being reviewed here, the only
love interest in all the stories was one of the paternal-filial
kind.   Hollywood added Captain Shang (voice of B.  D.  Wong).
The current film is based on the story version by the famous
children's books writer, Robert D San Souci.   China has been
invaded by the Hun, Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer).  The Emperor (Pat
Morita) decrees that every household must send one male to help
fight the invader.  Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), a feisty, brainy young lady
who, according to custom should be getting married, is very upset
because her aged father, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) the only male, is
thinking of joining the army and will surely be killed.  She throws
all caution aside, dresses like a male and secretly sets off to join
the army where she does heroic duty and helps save the day.
In the film, Mulan is slightly wounded, which is when it is revealed
to Captain Shang by the attending  physician that Mulan is woman.
In the original poem, the revelation comes when she returns home
from the war with a medal given her by the Emperor and the treasured
sword.    Adding the captain as the love interest does not hurt
anything.
There is the delightful character,  the dragon, Mushu, (Eddie
Murphy) who was originally an ornament on an incense burner who
comes alive to help Mulan.   There's the matchmaker (Miriam
Margolyes), there's Mulan's gruff but good-hearted comrade in arms,
Yao (Harvey Fierstein), Shang's singing voice (Donny Osmond), and
more.
One more word about the original poem which ended with a sentence
that became famous in China:   If two rabbits run side by side, how
can you tell which is the male and which the female?
Songs and music by Matthew Wilder, lyrics by David Zippel, and an
original score by Jerry Goldsmith.
Everyone connected with the film should be very proud.  It is
magnificent.

This seems to be the week I'm seeing a lot of movies.  "Armageddon" on
Sunday, I saw "Mulan" last night, I'm supposed to see one this evening,
and I haven't thought about the weekend yet, though I know "Last Days
of Disco" and "Henry Fool" are on some list somewhere.
Amusingly, I was sitting around this morning, waiting for the cable
guy.  Time Warner upgraded their system on the Upper West Side, and is
selling something called "MetroChoice", which lets me break that
mystical Channel 77 barrier.  It goes up to 88 or 90 now, or something
ridiculous.  In this unexplored wilderness is the Independent Film
Channel.  The new cable box is spiffy, too, having weird digital stuff,
like channel info (no more Channel 40) and a neat-o new remote control
with more buttons and an instruction booklet, unlike the crappy old
remote, with many buttons but no indication of what these buttons do
except make a LED brighten up on the cable box.  A definite
improvement.  Yes, I'm slowly approaching TV apocalypse.
So, down to business.  "Mulan" is the latest Disney animated feature,
continuing their exploration into the non-Western canon.  In brief, the
Huns are invading China, and the Emperor calls up troops to fight.
Mulan's father is drafted, but, fearing for his safety, she dresses as
a boy and takes his place.  She's accompanied by a small dragon, played
by a-long-way-from-"Raw" Eddie Murphy, a cricket and a horse.  At
training camp, after a rough start, she wins eventually the respect of
the other conscripts and the Captain.  They go off to war.  She
destroys the Hun army with a bit of ingenuity and cleverness, but her
identity is discovered.  So, she has to prove herself again.
This is a fun movie.  Eddie Murphy is pretty good, lots of laughs.
He's morphed into a family comedian over the years, and starring in a
Disney movie is the culmination of that transformation.  I've never
been a big fan of songs from Disney movies, so I'm not the best judge
for that: I thought they were fine.  Frighteningly, Donny Osmond does
some of the singing, so it's possible we'll see him at the Oscars.
(Figures from the Seventies and early Eighties seem to be popping out
of the woodwork recently.  Ricky Schroder, for example.  And there's
that "CHiPs" reunion.)
There's actually some breathtaking computer animation, better than the
dull, predictable stuff in "Godzilla" or "Armageddon": the Hun army
cresting the ridge feels like an innumerable horde, the pan of the
celebratory crowd around the Imperial Palace is elegant.
The story choice is also interesting for Disney.  Here, we have a
heroine that doesn't need rescuing: this ain't Sleeping Beauty.  And,
as Mr. Cranky (http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/mulan.html) notes, "Let's
give Disney some credit here for not pasting two cannonballs on their
forty-pound Chinese heroine."  The film is a conscious move away from
passive ideas of feminine beauty towards a notion of a girl who things
and can stand on her feet, at least according to one of the songs.  It
succeeds reasonably: she beats the Huns (twice!  Miler Time doesn't
happen after the first time), saves the Emperor, and is awarded a
counselor's position, which she declines in order to go home to see her
dad.  Along the way, the Captain becomes smitten, neatly solving the
initial Man Problem for Mulan.
Being completely indoctrinated in the Western Canon, I'm thoroughly
familiar with Hercules and Xena, but I've actually never heard of Mulan
before.  So, I invested effort into finding some synopsis of the
original "Legend of Mulan".  Infoseek gives me the following
non-Disney-related URL:  http://www.panap.com/mulan_index.html, an
outfit called "Pan Asian Publications" selling a children's book.  The
synopsis plays a bit differently from the Disney movie:
   The story of the female general, Mulan, was originally a folk song
   dating from the Northern Wei dynasty, A.D.386-534.
   According to legend, there was a young woman named Mulan whose aged
   father was conscripted. Mulan, unwilling to see her father fighting
   in a war, disguised herself as a man and joined the army in his
   place.
   For the next ten years she showed remarkable skill as a warrior and
   became a female general. Her true identity remained hidden from her
   comrades until the very end.
You can read the first five pages online.  Actually, the divergence
begins on Page 2.  Her parents know she's going off to war.  I suppose
they encouraged it, giving her money to buy arms and armor at the local
markets.  No subterfuge there.  (Vaguely surprising is why Disney
didn't pick up the "buying stuff at markets" thing: "kids, buy Mulan's
outfit, just like she did in the movie!"  I suppose that there'd be a
residual image of the Girl As Shopper if that thread were left in.)
In the original legend, at least by this synopsis, Mulan makes a career
of being a general.  In Disney's version, she's offered a career as a
stay-at-palace advisor.
Actually, I shouldn't go on about this too much.  Disney's version is
carefully honed for our time and our values.  It is not a 5th Century
legend, whose values would probably seem alien to us.  At the beginning
of the movie, when they were talking about family honor, I was thinking
of the Iliad, which I read earlier this year: Achilles version of the
ideal hero's life -- come home victorious or come home dead -- isn't
something that'll ring the bells for late 20th Century American
audiences.  A straight retelling of Mulan should have similar
problems.  Perhaps people will go out and read something of the
original sources:  after collecting the Quasi dolls, go off and pick up
Victor Hugo.  Maybe not, but it's a hope.
One quick note: it wasn't the Huns, properly, who invaded China.  "The
Huns" were the name given to North Asian nomads invading the Roman
Empire around 500 or 600AD.  The Great Wall and all that was a defense
against the various Mongol tribes.  I suppose Disney was afraid of
living Mongols complaining that they're not bloodthirsty barbarians,
and instead picked an extinct tribe to do the evil stuff.

     MULAN, which we saw being developed in Disney's Florida studios,
is the first Disney animated movie produced on the East Coast.  The
animators we talked with said that they relished the creative freedom
that being so far removed from corporate headquarters afforded them.
And, as in any skunkworks, the workers used their independence to build
the product they most wanted - forget those suits back at headquarters.
The impressive result, although not as spectacular as some of Disney's
recent offerings, bodes well for this isolated, creative team.
     Filmed in medium blues with warm rose accents, the animation is
handsome albeit not up to standards of THE LION KING.  Best in the
crowd sequences, the movie has a most awe-inspiring visual of an
attacking horde of Huns, with hundreds of bluish-gray men charging over
a snow-covered landscape.  Although the film's images are sumptuous,
its songs are all eminently forgettable.
     Opening with a reluctant and unconfident Mulan fixed up with
pancake make-up to look like a porcelain doll, the story has her off to
audition to be a bride.  (Mulan is voiced by Ming-Na Wen, last seen as
the take-charge, sexy wife in ONE NIGHT STAND.)  Mulan fails miserably
even with a cheat sheet of the right answers written on her arm.  She
finds her calling in life when she goes undercover in a male warrior
suit to take the place of her injured father in the Emperor's campaign
against the Hun invasion.  Huns, we find, look strikingly similar to
Klingon warriors.
     For help, Mulan's ghostly and bickering ancestors unwittingly send
along a smart-mouthed, tiny dragon, which Mulan calls a little lizard.
Eddie Murphy, who mumbles too many of his lines, plays the dragon,
Mushu.  A non-speaking, good-luck cricket, Cri-Kee, is Mushu's
sidekick.  The energetic Murphy tries to be Robin Williams, but
Murphy's lines aren't anywhere near ALADDIN quality.
     When Mulan arrives at the Emperor's boot camp, run by a Lyle
Lovett lookalike, she finds it full of snaggletoothed, male buffoons.
The recruits try to out macho each other with lines like, "I'm going to
hit you so hard it will make your ancestors dizzy."  She tries without
much success to be a masculine toughie by spitting and doing other guy
stuff.
     Mushu is not impressed with her initial progress.  "Oh, I think my
bunny slippers just ran for cover," he mocks her after her first
attempts at fighting like a soldier.  With shades of G. I. JANE, Mulan
soon goes from being a walking disaster to being the star pupil.
     Mulan doesn't reject her feminine side.  "Just because I look like
a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one," she says before
skinny-dipping in the closest stream.  To her consternation, her fellow
troops decide to join her in a scene both funny and sexual, even if not
exactly the shower scene from STARSHIP TROOPERS.
     The film's message is easily seen in the big Hun battle.  When
faced with overwhelming odds, the Emperor's men plan on dying with
honor.  Mulan, on the other hand, devises a winning strategy that
allows the other side to perish in glory instead.
     My son Jeffrey, age 9, gave the film ***.  His favorite line was
the father's "the greatest gift and honor is having you as a daughter."
He thought the dragon was really funny and the film's ending especially
good.  His buddy, Nickolas, age 9, gave the picture ** ˝.  He liked the
way Mulan always thought of new ideas, but he thought parts of the
story dragged.

Although it undoubtedly upset Disney executives, the disappointing
domestic box office performance of last year's _Hercules_ was probably the
best thing to happen to the Mouse's animation house.  While it was a light,
expertly crafted, and highly enjoyable trifle, it was just that, a trifle,
lacking the gravity that was a crucial ingredient of the studio's biggest
financial (_The_Lion_King_) and artistic (_Beauty_and_the_Beast_,
_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_) successes.  Seemingly galvanized by that
humbling wakeup call, Disney's tried-and-true blend of populist instincts
and weightier interests is back in full force and top form in _Mulan_.
In its current animation renaissance, Disney has proven to be better
suited to handling female protagonists (Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas) than male
ones (Aladdin and Hercules were varying degrees of milquetoast), and the
title character of Fa Mulan (spoken by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) is
no exception.  Crippled in their ongoing war with the Huns, the shorthanded
Imperial Chinese army requires that one male from each family join the
military cause.  The only male in the Fa family is Mulan's father (Soon-Tek
Oh), and, despite his advanced age and bad leg, he valiantly agrees to
enlist.  Determined to save her father from what is certain death and
maintain honor in the family, Mulan, in a sequence of stunning visual and
emotional power, cuts her hair, dons battle armor, and joins the army with
her father's summons as the male Ping.
Although all of Disney's recent heroines have been strong feminist role
models, none have been quite as proactive as Mulan.  As can be expected,
she initially cannot keep up with the guys in basic training, but she
manages to make her every man's equal, if not superior, through her sheer
will and determination.  Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of
Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama _G.I._Jane_, but _Mulan_ oneups
that film's hour-long toughening process by efficiently covering the same
ground during a single, rousing musical number, "I'll Make a Man Out of
You," sung by army captain Shang (spoken by B.D. Wong, sung by, yes, Donny
Osmond).  _Mulan_ also out-G.I.'s _Jane_ by having its heroine rely mostly
on wits, rather than brawn, in combat; while she has a high kick that
rivals the best of them, it's her quick-thinking brain that proves to be
most formidable.
The main thrust of the story sounds rather serious, but this is a Disney
film, after all, and it would not be complete without the requisite comic
relief, here in the form of the scrawny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy), who is
Mulan's self-appointed guardian.  A hilarious, jive-talking Murphy would
appear to be an out of place in this largely earnest tale, but Mushu is
more seamlessly integrated into the story than the seemingly grafted-on
comic relief in the two most serious Disney efforts, _Hunchback_ and
_Pocahontas_.  _Hunchback_  and _Pocahontas_ could have lost the sore-thumb
gargoyles and cute, mute Meeko the raccoon, respectively, without any major
loss to the film as a whole; however, the presence of Mushu, while still an
obvious concession to the masses, never feels gratuitous, and his funny
presence would be sorely missed.
Disney animated features have a rich musical tradition, and the downward
slide hinted at in _Hercules_ continues in _Mulan_.  _Mulan_ is the first
recent Disney animated effort that I feel could have easily survived
_without_ the songs, even if they are kept to a paltry (for Disney
standards) four.  Only two of the tunes by composer Matthew Wilder (yes, he
of "Break My Stride" fame) and _Hercules_ lyricist David Zippel, the lovely
if very short "Reflection," Mulan's de rigueur "I Want" song; and the
aforementioned "I'll Make a Man Out of You" serve a recognizable dramatic
purpose.  Nonetheless, Wilder deserves kudos for injecting some Oriental
flavor into the songs--for the most part, anyway (only "I'll Make a Man..."
sounds distinctly Western); but Zippel's lyrics are simply serviceable.
Picking up the slack is score composer Jerry Goldsmith, who gives _Mulan_
an appropriate epic sweep, most memorably in the haunting cue that
accompanies Mulan's fateful decision early in the film.
While the ears may be disappointed by _Mulan_, the eyes will be more than
satisfied.  Under the sure hands of directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft
and art director Ric Sluiter, _Mulan_'s look has a texture uncommon to most
animated features.  Backgrounds are kept fairly simple, and the screen is
often awash with scarlets and lavenders, creating a surreal yet emotionally
true visual landscape.  There's a general softness to the art, which fits
nicely the Eastern art tradition and lends the film a distinct identity and
personality.
I would not consider _Mulan_ to be in the upper echelon of Disney animated
features occupied by _Beauty_ and the highly underappreciated _Hunchback_,
but it ably upholds the Disney tradition of excellence.  Inspiring,
touching, serious, yet fun, _Mulan_ is animated entertainment of the
highest order, putting half-hearted efforts like Warner Bros.'s recent
_Quest_for_Camelot_ to shame.

The word is out on Mulan, Disney's latest, and it's very good. Even
the grouchiest activists admit that at least the round-eyed
barbarians didn't screw it up this time. Where I saw it, the teen
girls were swooning when Shang took his shirt off, they gasped at the
battlefield of death, they shrieked when the bad busted out, and were
rolling in the aisles at the jokes. After all the fuss over the
African themed Lion King, Native American Pocahontas, and racially
incorrect casting in Miss Saigon, maybe they finally got it right.
Disney has finally accomplished what thousands of years of Chinese
civilization couldn't do - turn an old Chinese legend into a
worldwide hit when every previous attempt has failed. Disney is even
re-releasing Miyazaki's Kikki's delivery service after signing a deal
to market Japan's equivalent of Disney's animated features which are
huge in Asia, but are still unknown except to Anime buffs this side
of the pond. Every Chinese girl might know about Mulan by heart, but
as a boy growing up with Spock, Luke Skywalker, and the Six Million
Dollar man, Maxine Hong Kingston's "Woman Warrior" was the first I
ever heard about it.
In the original poem, the girl Mulan takes her father's place in the
Chinese army, becomes a hero, goes home to retire, and her buddies
don't find out that he's a she until they visit her much later. In
other versions, she marries the guy, as it's been done with more
variations than the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  One woman on the usenet
complained that the real Mulan was a tough fighter, where Disney's is
sort of a Barbie doll that uses her wits to keep up with the guys.
She falls so that Shang has to carry her load but redeems herself by
using her wits to get the arrow nobody could climb and get.
Speaking of dolls, the Mattel's matchmaker Mulan looks great. It sure
beats the "Chinese Barbie" doll and ornament for those looking for
the rare Asian doll.  Most of the Disney dolls since Pocahontas have
ended up in the clearance bin, but this one might just sell out.
There's also a line about "each one a perfect porcelain doll", which
is where "China doll" came from before it came to mean exotic Asian
brides for Western men. Americans seem to love Asian women as brides,
news anchors and skaters. Maybe now we can add Disney heroine.
Disney's Mulan is a misfit as a potential bride. Her figure is modest
compared to the Cosmo girl builds of Pocahontas or Esmerelda. Mulan
is clearly skewed towards the girls in merchandising. But like most
Disney heroines, she's stuck with a bunch of guys as buddies from
Snow White's seven dwarves to Ariel's Flounder and Sebastian. Every
other McDonald's figurine is a guy, and when you put on her armour,
Mulan is one too! Ling, Yao and Chen Po are 3 stooges as backup like
Quasimodo's gargoyles or Timon and Pumba. But I doubt that they'll be
promoted to their own saturday series, and I'll be amazed if American
kids manage to memorize any names beyond Mushu, Mulan and Shang.
This one movie has more Asian American talent than Hollywood normally
hires in 5 years. It doesn't go quite as far as the 1960's Roger and
Hammersteins's "Flower Drum Song" where the entire cast, acting,
singing, and dancing, was Asian, except for the mugger, who was
white. But it's still the biggest Asian cast in a movie likely to
make the year's top 15 if not top 10.
Ming Na Wen, Mulan's speaking voice first hit it big on the Joy Luck
Club, and has had success on TV in ER and the Single Guy even in
roles originally cast for dumb blondes. Filipina Lea Salonga was the
original Miss Saigon, had a modest solo CD, and was the singing voice
of Alladin's Jasmine. Disney cast Michelle Kwan as Mulan in the
skating ABC-TV special (ha, beat that Tara!). For all that Asians
gripe about casting Caucasian men as Asians, Disney also cast Kristi
Yamaguchi as the Arabian Jasmine, and Kwan skated as Pocahontas as
well.
Captain Shang is built like Hercules, with the prowess of Bruce Lee.
In contrast to the usual complaint that the Asian guy doesn't get the
girl, he eventually warms up to Mulan after the Emporer tells him
"You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty". He sort of typifies
the real man's values when when "Save China" is number 1 on his list,
but "Get girl" is somewhere down the top 10. This must really drive
the girls nuts about us guys. The cassette storybook ending leaves
Mulan without her man at all.
Shang is played by B.D. Wong, from Madame Butterfly, Jurassic Park.
Yeah, he's not quite built like that. He's a real change from the
Asian guy loser stereotype, speaking of which, they also signed up
Gedde Watanabe who helped fill in some of the clunkiest nerd roles in
80's hits like Sixteen Candles.  Gedde lightens up the high pitched
Ling this time. Shang's singing voice is the same Donnie Osmond some
of us remember from his bad 70s hits days as the mormon version of
the Jackson 5. If you can't remember "One Bad Apple", check out the
Lost 45's on KJR-FM some weekend night.
The skating Shang wasn't Asian either, but if Asian parents produced
some strong male skaters and singers instead of just doctors and
violinists, maybe we'd have better luck next time. Shang's father is
James Shigeta, the son in "Flower Drum Song". He's also been cast as
a Japanese admiral and Japanese business executive. Pat Morita's role
as the Asian American version of John Houseman or James Earl Jones is
cemented as the emporer, not bad for a guy who first hit it big as
the wiseguy cook on Happy Days. 
James Hong is Chi Fu, sort of like Lost in Space's Dr. Smith who's
supposed to be on our side, but makes you wonder. He's never been the
star, but like John Lithgow, he's been everywhere including Big
Trouble in Little China, Blade Runner, and Operation Dumbo Drop. Ma
and Pa are Freda Foh Shen and Soon-Teck Oh.  I looked them up on the
internet and found out that they were part of the original 1976
Pacific Overtures, a Broadway play by Stephen Sondheim about
westerners and the Shoguns. Instead of Amy Hill, June Foray does a
fun Grandma, she was the original voice of Rocky the Squirrel
(surprise!). Grandma is disappointed that Mulan returns with the
emporer's medallion, but no man. Then she wants to sign up for the
next war when the hunk arrives at Mulan's heels.
Miguel Ferrer's Shan-Yu is drawn with the sharp edges of a Jonny
Quest villian.  He comes off like the Alien monster who comes back
for more just when we think he's buried. The cute stylized rag doll
is straight out of an anime epic. The scene of a burned out village
and body strewn battlefield was as nearly as striking as Luke's
burned out ranch in Star Wars.
George Takei, plays the first ancestor in a scene that looks like it
came straight out of Hercule's Mount Olympus. He was not only Sulu,
but he's making the reruns now as the poor ARVN guy who gets it
backing up John Wayne in the Green Berets. Is it PC to cast Eddie
Murphy as the black comic relief guy? No matter, as Mushu the Dragon
(yeah, the Chinese soft taco) Murphy is still a god and I've never
seen him funnier. He outdoes the Robin William's Genie without dated
cultural references or special effects
Some might be disappointed by the music. It breaks the string of
Menken hits, with a soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. But he's up there
with Titanic's Horner and Star War's John Williams in big time
symphonic scores like the Star Trek movie. It sounds like a return to
those epic Asian movies from the 1950s. It sems that when the PC
police got rid of stereotypical portrayals of Asians, Hollywood gave
up on Asian themes. Oddly, the CD album runs through the songs first
instead of following movie sequence. It also omits the short opening
title, and the mesmerizing synthesizer sequence when Mulan
"transforms". 
My wife tells us that "Honor to Us All" borrows from a common Chinese
folk tune.  It might be a traditional Chinese version of the Flower
Drum Song's "I Enjoy Being a Girl", which still pops up now and then
as the one hit song FDS firmly implanted into pop culture. Liberated
American girls might snicker at Mulan's tortures, while they dress up
in wonderbras, spike heels, and big hair to land their men. "I'll
Make a Man Out of You" might show up in future training or recruiting
films as a cross between Rocky and Enter the Dragon. I think Taiwan
still trains their soldiers this way. It hits home as a reprise as
the guys go into drag to sneak by the guards. "A Girl Worth Fighting
For" sounds a bit like South Pacific's "There is Nothing Like a Dame"
another hit musical comedy about war between Asian powers. Still, the
songs stick with stereotypical gender themes, and they still promote
the idea that guys have all the fun fighting and killing.
Disney soundtracks have always managed to eek out if not score big
with one or two hit songs, but I haven't heard anything from Mulan
yet. Stevie Wonder's True to Your Heart seems tacked on the end as a
party number. Reflection appears as a pop version, though I prefer
Salonga's broadway style solo which is as stiring as Ariel's
signature "Part of Your World". 
The computer graphics effects are Disney's best. They look seamless
with the awesome helicopter shot of the charging huns. The crowd
figures no long look like they're "It's a Small World" robots. Check
out the birds as the soldiers march across a signature Chinese
landscape, I think they're CG too.
Ironically, it's still too American for my parents in law, who can't
understand English dialogue, and think they know the Chinese story
and that Disney movies are for American kids. But my parents loved
it, as will anyone else who can appreciate a good Disney feature.

In the East Market she buys a spirited horse,
In the West Market she buys a saddle,
In the South Market she buys a bridle,
In the North Market she buys a long whip.
At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother,
In the evening camps on the Yellow River's bank.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears the Yellow River's flowing water cry tsien tsien.
At dawn she takes leave of the Yellow River,
In the evening she arrives at Black Mountain.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears Mount Yen's nomad horses cry tsiu tsiu.
She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war,
She crosses passes and mountains like flying.
Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots,
Chilly light shines on iron armor.
Generals die in a hundred battles,
Stout soldiers return after ten years.
On her return she sees the Son of Heaven,
The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall.
He gives out promotions in twelve ranks
And prizes of a hundred thousand and more.
The Khan asks her what she desires.
"Mu-lan has no use for a minister's post.
I wish to ride a swift mount
To take me back to my home."
When Father and Mother hear Daughter is coming
They go outside the wall to meet her, leaning on each other.
When Elder Sister hears Younger Sister is coming
She fixes her rouge, facing the door.
When Little Brother hears Elder Sister is coming
He whets the knife, quick quick, for pig and sheep.
"I open the door to my east chamber,
I sit on my couch in the west room,
I take off my wartime gown
And put on my old-time clothes."
Facing the window she fixes her cloudlike hair,
Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder
She goes out the door and sees her comrades.
Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed.
Traveling together for twelve years
They didn't know Mu-lan was a girl.
"The he-hare's feet go hop and skip,
The she-hare's eyes are muddled and fuddled.
Two hares running side by side close to the ground,
How can they tell if I am he or she?"

Written by: 
Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, Rita Hsiao, Christopher Sanders, Philip

classic Chinese folk tale.
Starring the voices of: 
Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Soon-Tek Oh, and Pat Morita
Synopsis:
Rumored to be about a true person, the story of MULAN has circulated in
oral tradition for over a thousand years, and has inspired operas,
literature, and even coinage. (Since 1984, China has been issuing annual
gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures; the
1992 set includes Mulan.)
In THE BALLAD OF MULAN (written in the 5th or 6th Century), an imperial
edict by the Khan (Emperor) orders men from each family to be drafted
into the army to defend China. A girl's parents hear sighing, and think
that their daughter Mulan (the name means Magnolia) is dreaming of boys,
but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm
father if he were to be drafted off to battle. Mulan bravely runs away,
masquerading as a boy, to serve in the army instead of her father. Ten
thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later, the army finally
returns in triumph. The Emperor wants to reward Mulan's valor with a
prestigious position in government, but she declines, accepts a horse,
and returns home quietly to don her true clothes. Mulan's old army
buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that
Mulan is actually a woman.
The Disney animated feature MULAN is similar to the BALLAD story, only
it adds a modern character for comic relief: Mushu the dragon (Eddie
Murphy). 
In Disney's MULAN, when a fierce army of invading Huns threatens to
overrun peaceful China the Emperor orders one man from each family to be
conscripted into the army. Old Mr. Fa (Soon-Tek Oh) is handicapped and
has no son; he has only his spirited young daughter Mulan (Ming-Na Wen).
Fearing for her father's life, the courageous Mulan secretly cuts her
hair, disguises herself as a man, and sneaks off to serve in the army in
her father's stead.
Meanwhile Mushu, the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the Fa
family, has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of
incense burner. (His only duty is to ring a gong.) Mushu hits upon a
plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the
disguised Mulan to become a macho male warrior hero. 
With the help of Mushu, a horse, and a lucky cricket, can army recruit
Mulan save China and bring honor to the Fa family?
Opinion: 
East meets West. I know a chef in Santa Fe that does this sort of magic;
he combines Asian culinary influences from the West Coast with Latin
American from down south and European from the Atlantic to concoct new
creations that hit just the right combination of flavors. From their
state of the art animation studio in Orlando, Disney is hoping to work
the same kind of East/West magic with MULAN. 
I mean, what would you say if I told you that a new movie featured Tang
Dynasty art, with Donny Osmond singing, Ming-Na Wen acting, and Eddie
Murphy playing a Chinese dragon that makes pop references to BATMAN and
the Reverend Jessie Jackson? Yet this is the case in the Disney's
re-interpretation of the familiar Chinese classic. The end result is
spectacular; MULAN is one of Disney's best movies ever. 
Personally, I'm also glad to see the detestable American stereotype of
the weak-willed subservient Asian woman take a beating: Mulan is
portrayed as a normal, if spirited, compassionate gal capable of taking
the initiative.  
MULAN is more than just Eastern graphics and faces combined with
Westernized pop and Disney. Kids of any age will like the family themes,
and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing. And adolescent
and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor, while the boys
admire the battles. And adults can admire those male/female nuances as
well as the interplay between traditional notions of family, honor, and
duty with industrial age notions of romantic love, gumption, and
questioning. But even the tiniest details reveal quality. The movie's
art supervisors spent three weeks in China researching the right look:
negative spaces, positive detail, period clothing, and graphic designs
typical of the time and place. Computers were used for crowd scenes of
up to 30,000 people, and a special program called 'Attila' was used for
a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking Huns on horseback. And
singers Osmond and Salonga are at the top of their game.
Balance is crucial. A movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by
Eddie Murphy might not be Disney's cup of tea, but if you use the
character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited
heroine, then, Pow! The Dream Team. By the same token, a tale about a
girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself,
but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism
for a light hearted Disney romp. It's rare that a movie can seamlessly
combine elements from both East and West, old and young, male and female
into a cohesive and entertaining whole, but MULAN hits the universal
bullseye. It's movie for any age, creed, gender, or color.
