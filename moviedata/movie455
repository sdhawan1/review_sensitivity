_Double_Take_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
Eddie Griffin, stand-up comic and star of the defunct UPN sitcom
_Malcolm_&_Eddie_.  Orlando Jones, co-star of _The_Replacements_ and
commonly recognized as the "7Up Guy."  Put these two together, and you
get an action comedy that can be called just about anything... but funny.
Despite what the ads lead one to believe, _Double_Take_ is not about
swapping identities so much as simply swapping outfits.  When some
heavies target Wall Street banker Daryl Chase (Jones) thanks to some
dirty dealings at his firm, he trades clothes with loudmouth street
hustler Freddy Tiffany (Griffin) to get out of a sticky situation.  After
the danger has been avoided and the two take a long trip to Mexico for
safety, for some reason the pair never think to switch back, and for
equally inscrutable reasons they start to play at being the
other--leading to all sorts of mistaken identity situations.  Never mind
that their impressions of each other wouldn't fool anybody, nor the fact
that Griffin and Jones simply LOOK NOTHING ALIKE--in changing from formal
to casual wear, they are taken as completely different people.
Maybe writer-director George Gallo was trying to make some
sociopolitical comment about how non-blacks think all blacks look alike,
but that's giving him way too much credit.  Besides, Gallo has a lot of
other things on his mind: namely the convolutions of his overly plotted
script.  _Double_Take_ appears to be a lark of an entertainment, but
there are so many sudden doublecrosses and reversals that it's
bewildering.  Not that deciphering the plot is worth the effort; the
explanations Gallo offers are crude at best.  If there's anything Gallo
successfully does, it's confuse the audience.
And if there's one thing Gallo certainly does not do, it's make the
audience laugh.  Given the right material Griffin and Jones can be funny,
but one would never know that from the few amusing moments they are able
to create here.  Jones' more lively qualities are muted in the straight
man role, and the goofy Griffin is hardly convincing when called to do
gunblazing action, not to mention he's just hampered in general by the
PG-13 limitations.  He was a lot more effective in the misbegotten Master
P vehicle _Foolish_--a far worse film than _Double_Take_, mind you, but
at least there he wasn't required to rein in his more profane (and more
effective) comic instincts.
But a lack of joyous abandon is the least of _Double_Take_'s problems. 
So what is the greatest?  A writer-director with a half-baked script and
not the vaguest clue of how to bring it to life.

There's nothing like taking a big, post-holiday breath, only to
experience something that smells like the ass of a man allergic to
toilet paper.  It happens every January, and unless you live in Iowa,
the stink is coming from your local megaplex.  Each year, as
Oscar-caliber films that saw limited release in major markets slowly
make their way to smaller cities, the big studios try to sneak their
worst films into theatres in the hope that you'll mistake Bette Midler's
Isn't She Great for Magnolia.
The trend continues this year with Double Take, a horrible film about
two characters who swap identities for reasons that still remain
unclear.  It's like a third-rate version of Kid 'N Play's Class Act,
which was a third-rate version of Trading Places, which I'm sure was a
third-rate version of something I'm just too young to remember.
Take stars two black men at opposite ends of the Manhattan social
spectrum. Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones from the 7UP commercials) is a
well-mannered, affluent "sell-out" who works for The Man and has a
supermodel girlfriend, while Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin, Malcolm &
Eddie) is phat, hip and, supposedly, phunny.  They meet when a thief
snatches Daryl's briefcase on the way to work.  We don't ever learn what
it is that Daryl does for a living, but know it must be important when
Freddy exclaims, "Man, how you get a big-ass office like this?" after
following Daryl to work.
We do know that Daryl's company is involved in some shady dealings with
a lazy-eyed Mexican, and before you know it (literally - because it
makes no sense), he's discovering dead bodies and being attacked by
gun-wielding maniacs because of his business connections.  A few really
bad explanations later, Daryl is mistaken for a murderer and hops on a
train in search of a CIA agent who can get him out of this pickle.
Freddy tags along, doing his best impression of Liza (loud, theatrical
and exceedingly annoying).
Take features more double-crossing, backstabbing and hidden identities
than either of the two Mission: Impossible films, which means, for a
film of this magnitude, that the whole thing is a lot more complicated
and messy than it needs to be.  Writer/director George Gallo,
responsible for the equally awful Trouble in Paradise, seems more
concerned about the big surprise ending (which is sooo not a surprise)
than trying to establish any continuity to the film.
There is a seemingly endless string of completely ludicrous events, like
when Daryl and Freddy take the train from New York to Texas and get
there overnight.  In another scene, which takes place in the middle of
nowhere, Daryl is able to procure a car and a fake moustache to alter
his identity in an attempt to cross the border.  It would be one thing
if it didn't make sense and was funny, but there isn't one second of
entertainment for anyone that doesn't require a drool bib.  Most of the
jokes come at the expense of the NYPD and the Mexican character's lazy
eye  all things that are so, like, 1999.
Jones is likeable enough as the straight man, but Griffin is so bad, he
would have ruined the picture even if it wasn't poorly written and
directed. When the film's only real talent (Vivica A. Fox) gets gunned
down in the first ten minutes, you know you're going to be in for a long
ride.  There's also a whole lot of swearing, but nothing bad enough to
warrant an "R" rating.
1:30  PG-13 for violence and adult language

When successful New York City investment banker Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones)
is framed for laundering Mexican drug money, he is forced to go on the lam
to find the one man who can clear his name. When he switches identities
with a petty thief, Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin), he figures he's home
free, until he learns that his new alias is in even bigger trouble in
"Double Take."
In the tradition of "Silver Streak," "The In-Laws" and "Trading Places,"
"Double Take" is a likable entry in the buddy, road-trip, beat-the-bad-guy,
save-the-girl action flick with two equally likable perfs by the leads. The
flick doesn't cover any new territory, but tries to be imaginative in the
telling Daryl's tale and his adventures, but is mainly a launch pad for
it's stars.
Orlando Jones, you'll remember, was the player who broke out in song in
last year's good-natured footballer, "The Replacements." It was a one-note
performance, but one that made you notice him. As Daryl Chase, Jones starts
out as the straight straightman for a big-time banking firm headed by
Charles Allsworth (Edward Herrmann). Their key client, a Mexican
"businessman" named Minty Gutierrez (Shawn Elliott), has just deposited a
whopping $106 million in their bank and Daryl smells a rat. He is pondering
what to do as he is leaving the office when he is mugged, only to be saved
by a fast-talking, street-smart rogue named Freddy Tiffany.
Intrigue builds around Daryl when he and his girlfriend Chloe (Garcelle
Beauvais) are attacked in their apartment and rescued by Agent McCready
(Gary Grubbs) and his men from the CIA. The spook tells Daryl that he must
get to Mexico to clear his name and help stop the drug cartel operating
there. As the scared banker heads south, he repeatedly crosses paths with
the tenacious Freddy, who helps him along his way. The story drives along
until its inevitable big shootout finale, which is predicated by the
Freddy's declaration, "It's payback time."
"Double Take" is mostly a cliché of the other films mentioned, but it is a
good showcase for Griffin and Jones. Eddie Griffin is best known as a
comedian and he provides a good deal of stand-up schtick along the way. The
good news is that, though his performance consists of a series of skits,
dances and fast-talking jive, it is funny! The diminutive Griffin has a
screen presence that is going to generate a lot of work for the actor.
Jones gets the opportunity to put variety into his perf as he goes from a
staid, conservative banker to a street-smart, hip-hopper who fast-talks his
way out of trouble. There are times when the actor mimics his costar to
perfection, showing his range and ability. Like Griffin, Jones should stay
employed for some time to come.
The supporting cast, though large in number, is definitely left in the
background. With the spotlight on the stars, no one else has the chance to
thesp, especially with the fast pace of the under 90 minute flick. Edward
Herrmann is there to lend his name to the credits and collect a check,
only.
The original screenplay, by director George Gallo, combines bits and pieces
from other movies of the same ilk. There are definite bad guys, like the
drug lord, but there is also a plethora of ambiguous loyalties as the story
uses movie sleight of hand to keep you guessing who are the bad guys and
who are the good guys. In this case, the CIA, once again, is used as an
evil scapegoat as corruption personified. The constant switching of whom is
good and bad gets a bit tedious as the film draws to its conclusion. The
film ends with the obligatory sitting-around-the-pool-on-a-Caribbean-island
scene, but it is used to tie up the last of the story threads.
Production is straightforward with good photography, varied settings and,
for Jones and Griffin, some funky costuming.
"Double Take" is a popcorn comedy/actioner that actually supplies both
elements. The lead characters are fun and funny and there is ample gunplay
for the shoot-em-up fans. I give it a C+.

I'm not mad that DOUBLE TAKE ("DT") was, for the most part, a pedestrian
comedy with a fairly generic, and plot hole-filled, storyline.  I'm not
mad that most of DT's relatively funny scenes were shown in its trailer
(and of those, that they all came at the beginning of the movie).  I'm
not even mad that, if DT is successful enough at the box office, Orlando
Jones will likely get more Eddie Griffin-type roles offered to him than
Orlando Jones-type roles (confused?  I'll explain in a minute).
What I am mad about is that America has become so desensitized to the
cuss word "nigga" - yeah, you heard; I called it a cuss word - that even
in its liberal usage, DOUBLE TAKE can still get a PG-13 rating.  MPAA
President Jack Valenti, you oughta be ashamed of your two-faced self.
But not as ashamed as those of Us who keep using that ugly term as if it
were an honorific, should be.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Nothing fancy here: Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones) is a successful wall
street banker who stumbled across some Funny Money which is somehow tied
to the Mexican corporation he, his assistant Shari (Vivica A. Fox), and
his boss C.A. (Edward Herrmann) are trying to do business with.  Pretty
soon, Daryl discovers that he's being set up to take a fall, all the
while being pursued by Martinez (Benny Nieves), Norville (Daniel
Roebuck) and Gradney (Sterling Macer Jr).  When the frame job turns into
a charge of murder, he "borrows" the identity of the one person who
might be able to help him - a street hustler named Freddy Tiffany (Eddie
Griffin) - and on the advice of FBI agent T.J. McCready (Gary Grubbs),
heads to Mexico.  But, as Daryl soon finds out, appearances can be
deceiving...
The Upshot:
It's clear from the start that the story in DOUBLE TAKE is secondary to
its main purpose, which is, primarily, to showcase the talents of its
stars: standup comedian Eddie Griffin and comic actor Orlando Jones.  In
this sense, it worked, at least partially; especially as pertains to
Jones.
I've seen Orlando Jones in a few previous roles: as one of the funnier
players in the otherwise dull THE REPLACEMENTS; as The Black Guy [uh,
sorry about that] in BEDAZZLED; and, yes, as the Comic Relief in some
7Up pop commercials.  But in DT, Jones impressed me much more than in
anything else I've ever seen him in - to the point where DT gets a
flashing yellowlight rating solely on the strength of his participation.
Jones' Daryl Chase was that rarity of Black comic skit characters: he
was as believable playing Mr. Wall Street (importantly, without the
unneeded Sellout Uncle Tom overtones) as he was the Schlitz Malt
Liquor-seeking hoodie rat.   The refreshing thing about his character,
in Wall Street-mode, is that Jones portrayed him as a smart, ambitious,
but realistic - and still Old School - achiever.  In other words, Chase
was Everyday Black Folk.  As I said, my estimation of the movie was
raised a notch because of Jones.
Even given my lowered expectations of this type of movie [everybody who
expected Shakespeare In The Round, raise your hands.  Thought so... ]
there's still a limit on the amount of wiggle room I'll give a flick,
"low-brow" or not.  Eddie Griffin quickly reached that limit.  Unlike
Jones, Griffin never made me believe he was anything but the
nigga-spouting street clown he portrayed from the start.  Maybe I
shouldn't be too hard on the brotha - after all, he is more a standup
comedian than a bona fide actor - but hey, I calls it as I sees it.  And
as I sees it in DT, Griffin's welcome was worn out before the end of the
first act.  He lacked the charm of a Jamie Foxx or the depth of an Eddie
Murphy [or is that vice-versa?]; and without much substance to work
with, the flash he had, quickly dulled.
As expected, the supporting cast members were primarily in place to
provide Jones and Griffin characters to bounce their schtick off of,
though Garcelle Beauvais as Chase's sultry lingerie model girlfriend
Chloe, and especially Andrea Navedo as the multi-faceted Maque Sanchez,
provided a bit more than the standard Warm Place To Put It parts that
one might predict of the female leads in an action comedy (strangely
enough, Vivica A. Fox, the one cast member who might've added more to
the DT stew, makes an early exit.  Bad move, guys).  Of the remaining
cast, even a veteran character actor like Edward Herrmann seemed like so
much jetsom and flotsam floating in a lifeless sea - though "Delores" -
Freddy's lap dog - provided an unexpected chuckle or two of her own.
If it seems like I hated this movie, I really didn't; DT never went very
far with me, but it did have its moments, and truthfully, Griffin did
improve over time (once Freddy stopped playing Street, and stopped
spouting "nigga", he was tolerable).  DOUBLE TAKE just wasn't my cup o'
tea; Your Method May, of course, Vary.
I just hope Hollywood casting agents start sending Orlando Jones scripts
that allow him to showcase his acting and comedic skills without always
and only requiring him to Act (their warped idea of) Black.  The Orlando
Jones I saw in DT wasn't the one-dimensional caricature that was his
okay-we-get-it-dammit! costar.  Here's hoping Jones allows his potential
to be challenged even further, regardless of the shortsightedness of
those who would typecast him.  Fingers crossed.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
I tried hard to keep my - can I make it plain? - my "boy, I hope White
Folk ain't diggin' this clown" kneejerk sensitivity in check; I truly
did.  And I genuinely liked Orlando Jones here; with a minimum of
over-the-top posturing, his Daryl Chase won me over, easily convincing
me that Jones' talent runs deep.  But there's only so much "nigga"ing I
can take.  And, along with it, only so much of the clowning Eddie
Griffin.
DOUBLE TAKE (rating: flashing yellowlight):
One take was quite enough, thankyewverramuch.

New year, new pile of movies straight from the Hollywood dumping ground
of badly test-screened, obscure, unfunny, and badly acted garbage. 
Double Take is the first pony out of the gate.  I don't know which is
the worst part of the film: Eddie Griffin's overacting, Orlando Jones'
non-acting, or the ugly mutt that passes as Griffin's sidekick.
Orlando Jones does a better job in those 7-Up commercials than in the
role of Darryl Chase, an uptight investment banker set up by a
combination of the CIA, the FBI, a Mexican drug cartel, the Federales,
and an emu farmer as part of a double murder/embezzlement scheme. 
Running from the law, Chase changes clothes and identity with Freddy
Tiffany, a two-bit hustler named played by Eddie Griffin he encounters
on the street.  Together, the pair travel across the country to Mexico,
where a certain CIA agent holds the key to Chase's freedom.  And of
course, during the journey, Darryl Chase rediscovers his roots as a
black man while Freddy Tiffany shucks and jives his way through every
situation like he's the bastard son of Eddie Murphy and Jerry Lewis.
After numerous car chases, way too many plot "twists," the
aforementioned annoying dog, the bad acting of Vivica A. Fox, and too
many jokes about a glass eye, the movie becomes a science project left
in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer.  Orlando Jones, a
genuinely talented actor/writer, seems out of place here, annoyed by the
film and especially by his costar's lack of acting ability.  Griffin has
the energy of Tito Puente, the humor of Richard Pryor, and the acting
ability of former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth.  Jones
deserves better material and collaborators.
It's a shame that Double Take is as bad as it is, because this cinematic
travesty was written and directed by George Gallo, the screenwriter of
one of the funniest films of the 1980's, Midnight Run (the plot of which
bears a striking similarity to this film).  Here are a few bonus facts
to consider if you haven't bought my evaluation: The film is based on an
obscure 1950's English film starring Rod Steiger called Across the
Bridge.  It took more than a decade to get the green light for
production.  It describes itself as a cross between "film noir, a
thriller, and a comedy."

Writer/director George Gallo's buddy movie, DOUBLE TAKE, stars Orlando 
Jones (THE REPLACEMENTS) as sophisticated stockbroker Daryl Chase and 
Eddie Griffin (DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO) as foul-mouthed street 
hustler Freddy Tiffany.  The confusing and awkward script is loosely 
based on the 1957 movie ACROSS THE BRIDGE with Rod Steiger.  
DOUBLE TAKE is a comedy in which half of the audience's laughs at our 
screening came from Freddy's propensity to mock his little, white, 
fluffy dog by calling her "bitch."  Personally, I didn't find any of the 
film funny, although I did smile when Freddy tried to drive a car across 
the Rio Grande.  Whoops, too deep.   
It all starts when Daryl befriends Freddy, who is falsely accused of a 
crime.  Or is he?  The movie relies on the old routine of things 
frequently not being what they seem.  Well, before you know it, Daryl is 
suspected of a double murder and is heading for Mexico, where the CIA 
will protect him.  
Along the way, Daryl and Freddy swap identities.  Daryl, who graduated 
from Harvard, has to learn the ways of the street from Freddy, who 
graduated from "HKU (Hard Knock University)."  In one embarrassing 
scene, Daryl shows off his impersonation skills by being loud and 
obnoxious to a black Amtrak waiter, while demanding Schlitz Malt Liquor 
with his dinner.
The ridiculousness of the script is perhaps best shown in Daryl's 
actions on the train.   While the train is moving, he demands that they 
install a 2-line phone, Internet access and a Fax machine in his 
compartment.  This just doesn't make any sense whether you take his 
request to be a serious one, as it appears to be, or as a joke.  In 
either case, it isn't funny, and it doesn't make any sense in the 
context of the story.
The entire movie plays like a  reject for a convoluted Saturday Night 
Live skit.  And if you ignore the comedic parts and evaluate the movie 
as a cop drama -- after all, lots of people die -- it has even less to 
offer.  This movie isn't even worth a first take, much less a double 
take.
DOUBLE TAKE runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and language and 
would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was funny and gave it ***.  His 
favorite part was the way that they switched places.  He said that the 
story did not fit together properly so they should have spent about 15 
more minutes in the beginning developing the characters.
