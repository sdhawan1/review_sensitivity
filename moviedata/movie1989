1992, R, 115 minutes [1 hour, 55 minutes]
starring: Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), Charles S. Dutton (Dillon), Charles
Dance (Clemens), Paul McGann (Golic); written by David Giler, Walter Hill,
Larry Ferguson, Vincent Ward; produced by Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill, David
Giler; directed by David Fincher; based on characters created by Dan
O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett.
Seen November 23, 1997 on home video (borrowed from my sister's roommate).
During the opening credits to "Alien 3" I could tell it was going to be
different from the others in the series, and that gave me high hopes. And
there is a major difference here that is somewhat of a relief, but at the
same time the difference is the problem. If the other films failed from
excessiveness, this one fails from depravity and blandness.
Like the first two films, the opening sequence has the credits appearing
over the void of space. But this time they are intercut with quick images of
something strange happening on the ship Ripley (Weaver) and the survivors
used to escape from the alien planet. And wouldn't you know it - one of those
pesky aliens somehow got on the ship too. 
Ripley's ship crash lands on a desolate planet used as a prison for violent
criminals, who seem to have formed some sort of cult. They have little
technology but manage to save only Ripley.
The first third is extremely slow in its storytelling. Almost nothing
happens in terms of plot development, instead we just get interaction between
Ripley and the prison doctor, Clemens (Dance), and the cult leader Dillon
(Dutton). The alien itself is barely shown, only in the shadows, and in
disorienting shots at that (how original). Somehow a larvae is imbedded in a
dog's body, and during a scene in which Ripley, Clemens, and Dillon cremate
the bodies of Newt and Hicks, we see it be "born" while Dillon recites an
eerie eulogy.
At first I was intrigued by the Gothic atmosphere here, and the
aforementioned scenes built up  at least some suspense. It's clear Fincher
wants to do something different, and for that I applaud him. However, just
when he had us in the palm of his hand and ready to squeeze, he lets us go by
allowing the story to become a complete re-tread of the first two films.
Ripley never mentions the aliens and her experience until almost the halfway
point, and of course when she does no one believes her. Therefore, is it
surprising the most cynical, easy-to-hate character is killed by the alien
for all to see?
You would think once some semblance of plot and conflict is established the
film would have direction. Unfortunately the second half is just as slowly
paced as the first. Not only that, but we get many of the same old gimmicks
such as Ripley and the others having to wait a long time for a rescue party;
the fact there are almost no weapons; supporting characters getting killed by
the alien; and of course lots of tunnels, drains, and other places for the
alien to hide, and for the people to trap themselves in.
The last act contains the same old climax with the five-minute countdown
that will "certainly" lead to the alien's doom, but kills off more supporting
characters in the process. Fincher at least shoots these scenes in a bizarre
manner that gives one a sense a vertigo. Elements like this crop up
throughout the picture and it's a shame they weren't taken advantage of.
It's not that "Alien 3" is a bad movie per se, there's just not enough to
appreciate.

My recommendation: 
     No matter how much you enjoyed ALIEN and ALIENS, stay away from
this movie.  If your curiousity about Ripley's fate is going to drive
you nuts until you see it, wait until it comes to the $1.49 theatres.
The wait will entail more suspense than you'll get out the entire
movie.
     ALIEN 3 tells of one more encounter between Lieutenant Ripley
(Weaver) and The Alien.  The movie opens with a very well done sequence
of shots interleaving long, silent views of space and stars with quick,
sharp shots of fire breaking out in a ship containing Ripley and her
cohorts.  Unfortunately, the visual drama of the interleaved shots is
interrupted by endless film credits.  The four travelers lie in
hyperstasis as crisis breaks out around them.  Their life-sustaining
units automatically slide into an escape vehicle and plummet to the
surface of a nearby planet.
     The rest of the movie is unbearably predictable.  Ripley learns
that the Alien has also landed on the planet.  Together with her and
about twenty dangerous convicts, it lurks in a massive, heavy, dark,
wet, moldy, underground refinery.  The convicts have adopted a religious
fanaticism as a way of controlling their inner drives.  They consider
Ripley to be a destablizing force.  Unfortunately, their resentment and
prejudice toward her is two-dimensional and bland.  For the remainder
of the movie (the remaining hour and a half), we follow Ripley as she
challenges the warden of the convicts, tries to convince everyone that
the alien is a dangerous entity, and then organizes an alien hunt
through the dimly lit ductwork and tunnels of the refinery.  Ripley's
character is central to the movie.  Yet she remains lifeless,
glamorless, and drab.  Her charisma, so strong in ALIEN and ALIENS, is
disturbingly absent.  As she moves through the movie, one almost does
not care what is happening to her.
     The camera work of the chase is interesting.  The camera follows
the point of view of the alien.  The alien has a tendency to run around
on the ceiling during the chase, so the picture flips up and down and
around in a compelling manner.  Unfortunately, this one clever
technicality fails to carry a long, drawn-out, repetitious, sometimes
confusing scene.
(Hit 'n' now if you want to avoid minor spoilers) 
     The only interesting character, the medic who cares for Ripley as
she emerges from hyperstasis, meets an early end.  The other character
with potential, the religious leader of the convicts fails to be
charming, appealing, or inspiring in any way.  The plot development is
so confused that when he finally sacrifices himself for the good of
all, it is unclear why it is necessary and why Ripley does not join 
him.  
     The thread of action looses sense many times as the movie unfolds.
Several times, one has no idea what just happened or why.  When the
prison warden is looking at a CAT scan of Ripley's head, we are
supposed to be horrified at what we see, as he describes it to Ripley,
but the horrifying sight is impossible to pick out.  The audience sits
confused, peering at the screen as the warden announces the worst to
Ripley.
(Hit 'n' now if you want to avoid a slightly bigger spoiler) 
     Ripley's final sacrifice is utterly melodramatic, predictable and
boring.  The outspread arms in the symbol of the cross falling into the
fire project a lame image.  Instead of emanating noble self-immolation,
the falling body seems pitiful.
     In summary, wait until a friend rents the movie and watch it for
free -- with the Sunday paper in hand for the long, boring parts.

          Capsule review:  Fury is a dreary, ugly prison colony
     planet, made up of "double-Y-chromosome" criminals who have
     rediscovered monastic life.  To this planet comes Ripley and
     her alien.  And Ripley's nightmare starts over.  ALIEN 3 will
     probably kill the series.  Director David Fincher's previous
     major credit is music videos for Madonna.  Rating: -1 (-4 to
     +4).
     In 1979 Ridley Scott directed ALIEN.  Scott had previously directed the
moody story THE DUELLISTS.  The inspiration for ALIEN was the weird
surrealist paintings of H. R. Giger.  The world Giger creates has the feel
of an alien culture, the feel of a mind incomprehensible to humans at work.
In 1986 James Cameron directed ALIENS.  Cameron had directed TERMINATOR.
His inspiration was apparently to show how a company of marines reacts when
faced with something like the alien threat of the first film.  While many of
the sequences are lifted from the previous film, Cameron brought complexity
to the character of Ripley and had a reasonably complex plot.  Now 20th
Century Fox has made ALIEN 3.  For a director they got David Fincher, who
has had a successful career directing music videos and television
commercials.  The inspiration appears to have been an empty slot at the
beginning of the 1992 summer release schedule.
     I thought the first film was the best of the series and the second film
was a step down.  It borrowed whole sequences and ideas from the first film.
Also it seemed to sidestep very lightly the moral issue of the earth people
stealing and transforming a planet already colonized by an intelligent alien
race.  It is genuinely surprising and more than a little disturbing how many
of the audience were rooting to see the aliens exterminated because they
were hostile to humans and not cute and dewy-eyed.  Unintentionally, ALIENS
was an intriguing test of whether the audience would still buy into
attitudes that had caused major foreign policy failures in the past.  (And
the answer was an undeniably "YES!"  Audience cheered ideas as blatant as,
"Let's withdraw and nuke 'em from orbit."  Perhaps what it showed was that
in the end we are just only to those we find appealing.)  There were many
who preferred the second film for its realistic treatment of marines in
space.
     The third film is easily the weakest of the three.  On one of the
ugliest planets ever portrayed in film, human criminals and an alien tear
away at each other in the cinematic equivalent of a pit bull fight.  The pit
is Fury 161, an evacuated lead mine and prison colony.  There the worst
outcasts of the galaxy have been isolated and have formed a sort of monastic
order living in the lead mining facilities.  They have no weapons and, to
make the place even uglier, they all have to shave their heads because the
planet is infested with lice.  On this delightful planet crashes Ellen
Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), the future equivalent of Typhoid Mary.
When deaths start occurring on Fury 161, Ripley realizes what she has done
but--for reasons never explained--still refers to tell the inhabitants even
while people are being killed.  Most of the rest of the film is running and
screaming through the ugly lead mine.
     Fincher has filmed ALIEN 3 with a lot of superficial attempts at style.
The foundry seems like one big dark and ugly basement.  One or two scenes
with odd camera angles, shooting up or down on characters, would be welcome.
Fincher, perhaps used to short music videos, does not seem to know that
eventually this becomes very tiresome.  The plot takes a long time to
advance and in the first half is also short on action.  Without sympathy for
Ripley from previous films and some minor flashes of humanity from the
prison doctor, the film is without sympathetic characters at all.  The
screenplay is by three people with two different conjunctions: it is by
David Giller & Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson.
     This is a film that I can recommend only to people into the "Alien"
series as a series.  (And since this is a third director with a third
concept and a third style, this is much more loosely a series than it might
be.)  As a film it is no better than much of the low-budget productions that
show up only on cable.  I rate this one a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.
The way the alien is killed ranks with one of the most absurd sequences I
can think of in a major science fiction film, and is arguably inconsistent
with previous entries in the series.

     ALIEN 3 is a dumb movie.  It makes dumb mistakes, and has a dumb
plot.  While ALIEN was an intelligent suspense flick and ALIENS was a
masterful action flick, ALIEN 3 is nothing more than a painfully poor
movie.
     The dialogue is so bad it is distracting at every turn, the acting
is not horrid, but it is uninspired and flat through-out.  There is no
emotion on anyone's part (none of ALIENS "Game over, game over man!")
and the entire mood of the picture is, "Oh, there's an Alien eating
everyone.  Wow."
     The plot is at once simplistic and confusing.  The characters
actions are never explained well, the "plan" doesn't make any sense, and
the entire plot revolves around the Alien being extremely stupid (while
the Alien in ALIEN and the Aliens in ALIENS were demonstrably quite
bright).
     The direction is horrid.  The motion is uneven and badly done.  The
camera is used to compensate for bad plotting by making the shots
confusing and difficult to see.  The dialog is hard to hear in many
places, and there is no sense of suspense or even interest.  With all
the things that are wrong with this movie, the direction is the worst.
It appears this refugee from MTV videos (and supposed to be good at
them) will not be making a strong move to the silver screen.  Everyone
should be extremely thankful of this.
     The best thing about this movie is the title.  ALIEN^3 (Cubed).  It
manages to sneak in a "3" reference, tell you the movie is about a
*single* Alien (one cubed is one) and doesn't repeat the stupidity of
RAMBO III (the sequel to RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II).
SPOILER Alert and Plot nit-picks (serious nit picks):
     The movie starts off badly.  Three of the surviving four people from
ALIENS are killed during the opening credits, with no explanation as to
how or why.  We know from ALIENS that there is no possible way that
Alien eggs could have been on the ship, and yet we have two at the
beginning of this movie.  Why?  Because no one was imaginative enough to
think up an original plot, so they decided on the old monster movie
ploy: "Even though you saw us kill every last monster in the last movie,
guess what?  We missed one, and it's pissed off."
     Lt. Ripley is impregnated with an Alien, even though the integrity
of her hypersleep capsule was intact and no "facehugger" remains were
left with her.
     It is quite obvious Hicks was killed because the producers didn't
want to pay Michael Biehn.
     While the Alien in ALIEN was sly and tended to strike quickly and
then vanish (presumably to eat its prey) this one just runs around
killing people.  It will move from one body to the next live one without
a moments hesitation.  We have no explanation for this other than it
allows for an extremely stupid chase sequence where the characters all
get to act as live bait luring the surprisingly stupid Alien to the "kill
zone."
     In short, the movie violates just about every single rule of making
a successful sequel.  It is not at all true to the original movies, it
changes the rules from what we know, and it is poorly made.
     It is not as bad a movie as HIGHLANDER II, but it is not much
better.  A -3 is pretty generous on my part, and it only rates that
because I liked the character of the religious zealot quite a bit.

CAPSULE: The weakest and least engaging of the Alien movies, dragged 
down by an uninvolving story and no real tension.
ALIEN 3 (the "3" should be in superscript) is a sad and wan entry in 
what was shaping up as one of the best SF sagas ever put on screen. It 
continues the story of Ripley, the 
space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist, but seems remarkably 
uninterested in her. In fact, the movie seems lucky to be interested in 
anything at all, it's so elegaic and limp. A little of this would have 
been nice for atmosphere, but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from 
the beginning.
At the end of the last film (ALIENS), Ripley and two survivors were on 
their way home. Unfortunately, an alien pod had been deposited in their 
ship, and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod. The 
pod crashes on Firorina 161, a prison planet designed to house the 
incurably criminally violent. Ripley lives through the crash; the others 
do not.
The prison is a grim place, even as prisons go -- it's been built around 
the remnants of an abandoned steelworks, which provides no end of 
techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against. Lice are 
endemic, and so Ripley's head is shaved (another surreal touch). At 
first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until 
a Company rescue ship can arrive, but it doesn't stay that way. One of 
the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches, and soon a 
newly-gestated alien is running amuck. Worse, it looks like Ripley 
herself has been impregnated.
What's weird is how little tension this generates, except near the end, 
when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic 
form of cheating imaginable: loud music, shaky camerawork, etc. 
Sigourney Weaver has become comfortable with the role, and she does well 
with it, but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack. 
The supporting actors are also not given a lot to do: the doctor 
(Charles Dance) and another, rather religious inmate (Charles S. Dutton, 
very good), hiave presence, but they're not asked to do anything with 
it.
In light of the impending sequel, which apparently plays fast and loose 
with the ending of this movie, I will not talk about the ending -- 
except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab 
movie. It's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational 
thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the 
rest of it.

     Let me first confess that I absolutely loved ALIEN (1979) and
ALIENS (1986).  In fact, ALIENS is one of my favorite (top 20 or 30)
movies of all time.  I was extremely disappointed by ALIEN 3.  In
ALIEN, the shock of the concept as well as the acting carried the
picture.  In ALIENS the fear of the beast was tempered by the sweetness
of the little Newt character.  Most of the same writers (Larry
Ferguson, David Giler, Walter Hill, and Vincent Ward) are back, but
this time with a different director (David Fincher) and mainly a new
cast, and they craft a totally different vision.  This is a dark and
mean spirited show.  Both of the first two had gems of hope in them.
This one reeks with despair and hopelessness.
     As always, Sigourney Weaver is back as the ever resourceful
Ripley.  Other than Lance Henriksen as Bishop II, I think most of the
rest of the cast is new to the ALIEN series.  In ALIEN 3 we have
Charles Dutton as Dillon, Dance as Clemens, Paul McGann as Golic, Brian
Glover as Andrews, Ralph Brown as Aaron, Danny Webb as Morse,
Christopher John Fields as Rains, and Holt McCallany as Junior.   The
cast is acceptable, but none of them are very impressive.  The problem
in the movie boils to two words, script and direction.  Both are
pathetic.
     What didn't I like about it? Mostly it is boring.  It is a one act
and one scene play that has a short and mildly interesting prologue.
The prologue is maybe 10-15 minutes long.  I did not time it because I
thought the rest of the movie would have lots of scenes and be much
more interesting.  In fact the rest of the movie is a lugubrious and
unsuspenseful 2 person show, Weaver and the monster.
     Remember what wonderful and essential other characters there were
in the other movies? Well, there are a few other potentially
interesting actors in ALIEN 3, but they are never developed and have
almost nothing essential to do other than keep it from being a 2 person
play.  Remember the suspense, fear, and intensity of ALIEN and ALIENS?
Good, hold that memory while watching this show.  Memories are good;
this show isn't.  Better see it while it is still on the big screen.
The murky cinematography by Alex Thomson is so dark it may be invisible
on the little boob tube at home.
     You say, well there must be SOMETHING you liked in it? Well, yes
there is a tiny mystery in the way that the monster acts toward Weaver.
This mystery is easily solved yet I found the premise kind of cute.
     ALIEN 3 runs way too long at 1:55.  I wish editor Terry Rawlings
had hacked away more of this depressing film.  It is correctly rated R
for violence and bad language.  It would be okay for most teenagers.  I
give it a thumbs down recommendation and a single *.  If you are a real
ALIEN series fan, I do not think you will be able to miss seeing it.
Even with terrible reviews I had to see this movie.  I remain hopeful
that ALIEN 4 will be more like the best in the series which was ALIENS.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

     ALIEN 3 is a film directed by David Fincher, from a script by David
Giler, Walter Hill, and Larry Ferguson.  It stars Sigourney Weaver,
Charles S. Dutton, Paul McGann, and Lance Henriksen.  Rated R, for
violence, language.
     ALIEN 3 is, of course, the latest sequel to 1979's ALIEN, a
landmark movie in its genre that scared the living daylights out of us
all and has had us coming back for more for 13 years.  ALIEN was poetic,
scary, and innovative.  ALIENS (1986) was the roller-coaster ride
through hell.  ALIEN 3 is grim, monochromatic, neither as scary nor as
fast-paced as its predecessors.  And yet, it's a lot better than I had
been led to expect.
     Someone tell us the story of how David Fincher, an MTV veteran, got
the assignment to do this very expensive, potentially very lucrative
film.  It turns out to be an interesting choice since the editing style
and the photography appear to me to be highly influenced by the music
video style.  Some film student should have a lot of fun writing this
one up.  I don't have the name of photographer here, but I must say I
intensely enjoyed the photography in this film, there being times when
it takes on a life of its own, quite apart from the action.  I'm
thinking a shot of sprinklers that look like ballerinas in ankle-length
tutus, from which point on I became almost distractingly aware of the
photography.
     The story has a couple of interesting twists to it that ought to
appeal to veterans of the series.  And the supporting players are an
interesting bunch.  With everybody's head shaved, one concentrates on
the faces more, and they an interesting lot of faces, not very pretty
for the most part, but very interesting.  Sigourney Weaver is pretty
much the whole show, but a couple of the others come perilously close to
upstaging here once or twice.
     John Hartl in the Seattle Times made the interesting observation
that the film is a metaphor about disease.  After comparing it to NO
EXIT or last year's POISON as a Hollywood version of trapped people
with no defenses, he mentions that if the first film was about cancer,
this one is about AIDS.  There is a "vow of celibacy that also includes
women."  There are complaints about the lack of condoms and characters
says things like: "I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you" and "I
don't have much time, I'm dead already."  This is a metaphor, remember,
but one with a lot of resonance for me.
     If you're a fan of the series, you will see ALIEN 3 regardless of
what I say, so it hardly matters that I think you ought to, even at full
price.  If you're not one of the converted, you might want to give it a
go at matinee rates.  It has its points.

     Okay, folks.  Forget anything else you may have heard about this
film, because Rick J. Rauser has *his* review here (egotism is a joke,
actually).
     Seriously, let's talk ALIEN.  Or to be more precise, ALIEN 3 (or
ALIEN CUBED, depending on which rumors you believe).  Let me say this
bluntly: ALIEN 3 is not as good as the first two films.  That having
been said, let me go on to stress that ALIEN 3 is a good, good flick.
It's scary, it's well paced, and the effects are nice.  
     Visually, this film is dazzling.  It looks that good.  The prison
is just as eerie as the Nostromo or the colony settlement on LV-426.  In
fact, I think it's more so.  Well done, well done.  The alien itself is
a nice, spooky variety as in the first two flicks ... but this time the
alien is different.  I won't tell you how, and it's so subtle you might
not pick it up ... but watch for it when you see this film.
     ALIEN 3 has a shocker ending (presuming you haven't been reading
Hollywood gossip columns or spoiler reviews) which, I'm sad to say, was
filmed very poorly.  The ending is great, the way it looks on screen is
almost laughable.  It's sad, because the rest of the film is visually
perfect.  The ending ... *ach*.  But don't let that throw you, it's a
small gripe.
     Another big gripe that I couldn't forget (that's why I'm now typing
it out) is how the characters in this film don't like each other.  They
really don't.  There's no friendship or bonding as in the first two
films between the human victims/fighters.  These characters seem to want
each other to die ... also, this film has an annoying habit of killing
off the wrong characters.  Don't get bonded to any of them, faithful
viewer.  If you thought they were expendable in ALIEN and ALIENS, you
ain't seen nothing yet.
     I also hate the marketing people who deceived us for months on end
with previews that said "In 1992 we will discover ... on Earth ...
everyone can hear you scream."  I'm not giving anything away by telling
you that this film is not set on or near Earth.  That preview is old
garbage, and I'm sure you all know that by now.  But still that annoys
me.  Another scene that I saw in previews was of one of the characters
pressed against a chainlink fence screaming.  *Boy*, that looked cool,
I thought ... the guy in the film is only yelling at Ripley in annoyance.
Again, false advertising.  But it was minor.
     Look forward to wonderful scenery, a fantastic autopsy, a small
group of likable characters (even though they don't like or bond with
each other) a great ending (marred by crappy directing - just the
ending, mind you--and poor filming--again, just the ending) that will
really surprise you and a *wonderful* chase scene near the movie's end.  
     Good stuff, ALIEN 3, good stuff.  Just like DIE HARD 2 this film
doesn't quite live up to what went before it, but like DIE HARD, ALIENS
and ALIEN were tough, tough acts to follow so I don't blame Fox for the
fact that ALIEN 3 fell a little short of the mark.  It's not a huge
film, like the first two were ... it's more of a quick, scary flick.  It
reminds me of Leviathan, if any of you have seen that.  It's short and
satisfying, but not a huge, great horror/sci-fi epic like ALIENS, nor a
long, nicely paced landmark like ALIEN.  
    But let ALIEN 3 breathe freely and you'll be quite happy with it,
in my humble opinion.  It is not a *great* movie, like the first two.   
    It is, however, very, very *good* and I more than highly recommend
it.   Overall, I am happy to give ALIEN 3 eight out of ten.  My
complaints were fairly minor, and the only thing that prevents this
movie from being fantastic is that it doesn't do enough and doesn't look
far enough.  After seeing it you'll undoubtably be happy, yet you'll
also agree it's a "small" film, dealing with a small incident, not a
huge one like the first two.
     However, it's a small incident that you'll really enjoy sitting
through.
     By the way, the way the story runs and the way the film finishes
off leaves more than enough room for ALIEN 4....

Alien 3 (1992)
Rated R for strong violence and language, and for sex
----------  Out of 4 stars: ***1/2 (3 1/2 Stars)
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Pete Postlethwaite, Lance Henriksen
ALIEN 3 is the only Alien film I have seen in theaters.  I saw it when I was 13 years old, and I must admit
that I didn't like it.  Of course, I was expecting ALIENS again, and I believe this was my fault.  In order to
appreciate ALIEN 3, you need to see ALIENS, but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its
predecessor.  James Cameron's ALIENS was an action film, and many people consider it the best in the series.
I am among that group, but ALIEN 3 is an extremely entertaining film, which critics have bashed for its
originality. Many thought the final chase scene went on for too long, and many others thought that the film
was too much dialogue and not enough action.  Both are untrue, because the film has quite a bit of action, and
the dialogue was essential and well-written.  As for the chase sequence, it was long, but not overly long,
creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion.
Perhaps watching ALIEN 3 on video helped.  On the big screen, I was
overwhelmed by something I normally didn't see.  It was a very dark
film, and the language was extremely harsh.  I had always figured the
Alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities.
Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying films should eliminate swearing,
but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks, it
gets rather distracting.  However, since seeing it again, I realize
that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in
the characters.  As a result, ALIEN 3's only flaw (albeit a major one)
is the underdeveloped characters.  We never really care about any of
them, and I get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to
shorten the length of the movie.  There were only two characters I
liked, and of course one was Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), although
we have gotten to know her through two other films.  The other
character was Dr. Clemens (Charles Dance), but because we like him,
the inevitable occurs.
ALIEN 3 begins exactly where ALIENS left off.  The prologue of ALIEN 3
is a pure cinematic achievement by director David Fincher, who had
only directed music videos before his chance with this Alien entry.
Without using a single line of dialogue (unless you count computer
warnings), Fincher sets up the entire film.  An impressive aspect of
this is that Fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting
to a title card.  We see Lt. Ripley and the little girl in their
cryogenic compartments... (title)... a shot of an alien egg...
(title)... alien legs stretch up into the air... (title)... and so on
and so on.  During these first ten minutes, I learned everything I had
to in order for ALIEN 3 to proceed.  It's quite a remarkable opening,
and one which will remain in my mind for a long time.
Because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel
from ALIENS, the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod,
and sent down to the nearest planet: Fiorina Fury-161, an ore refinery
which has been turned into a maximum security prison.  However, the
face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes, and is
sent down with the escape pod.  Unfortunately, during the landing, all
but one of the survivors from ALIENS is killed.  Ripley is discovered
by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery.  Of course, you
need a carrier for this face-hugger, and it attachs itself to the dog
which came with the team of inmates.  Ripley is revived and asks to
see the ship.  After seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section, Ripley
asks to see the dead bodies, and then have them cremated.  This
cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the
Alien films.  Featuring a monologue from Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), a
prisoner who has found God, the movie cuts back and forth from the
ceremony to the dog's demise.  It's one of the most memorable moments,
as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog.
And this is where ALIEN 3 succeeds.  Fincher normally injects a lot of
symbolism into his films, and I can easily see him becoming the next
Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock (in fact, he is the mixture of
both).  Fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it, and I
figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control
over his films.  ALIEN 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and
metaphorical images.  By doing so, Fincher creates some of the best
scenes in the entire Alien franchise.  Many people have criticized
Fincher's filming of the death scene of Ripley (I reveal nothing by
saying this) as looking too fake, but I enjoy and relish in the
portrayal.  Showing Ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch, but by
actually not showing her hit the vat of iron, a great deal of
symbolism is derived.  I feel that it would have spoiled the mood of
the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten
iron.  However, most people seem to want to witness Ripley die (which
creates a paradox, as she is the character I didn't want to see die).
Why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film, and I don't
plan on spoiling that in this review.
>From every ALIEN film comes several memorable moments which seem to
stick with you forever.  In Alien, it was, of course, the moment the
alien burst out of Kane's stomach.  In ALIENS, it was the showdown
between alien and Ripley in a machine.  ALIEN 3 has several, but most
memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and Ripley.  Ripley
is pushed up against a wall, and the alien stands inches away from
her.  Why it doesn't kill her is a shocker, which later leads to a
surprise ending.  Fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors'
faces (Michael Douglas and the clown face-off in THE GAME in the same
style), and by shaving off the actors' hair, the only thing we have to
look at is their faces.  Many critics didn't like all the actors being
bald, but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot.
Most of ALIEN 3 works when you take it in context of the story, but
when you try to compare it to its predecessors, Fincher's turn seems a
bit gloomy and dark, though that's not always a bad thing.
The plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films, with some
major twists.  Again, we are setup with several different characters,
and one by one, they are picked off.  However, while the first two had
tons of arsenal (especially Cameron's film), ALIEN 3 takes place on a
planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison.  As a
result, no weapons are to be found.  This creates a lot of tension,
although I must admit that Fincher could have added a lot more
suspense.  As an Alien film, ALIEN 3 is the worst of the series, but
by itself, it is an extremely well-made motion picture, with a lot
more merits than not.  The unfortunate thing surrounding this second
sequel is the one-dimensional characters.  I never was really
emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are
hardcore criminals whom I really could care less about.  Despite this,
Ripley was the central figure, and that's what is important.  We care
for her, even though she began to act just like one of the guys.
Again, the technical side of this film is remarkable, and better than
the two previous versions.  While Cameron's version was a pumped up
action film with massive artillary, Fincher uses brilliant camera
angles, terrific lighting, and moody sets.  The cinematography, by
Alex Thomson, is very well done, with a terrific chase sequence
towards the end of the movie.  The confusion of the ending draws the
viewer in, as we are just as confused as the actors who are being
chased around.  The yellows, reds, and oranges of the lights create a
dark mood, and by themselves create a lot of suspense.  Shadows dance
on the walls, and yet those shadows could easily be the alien.  The
alien is different from its predecessors this time around, and the
swiftness of this alien is quite intense.  The camera likes to take up
the perspective of the alien, racing after the characters.  The sets
are quite incredible, which are reminiscient of the Nostromo from
ALIEN.  The narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well
constructed.  The sets appear to be in the future, but not too far in
the future.  One of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the
alien (nothing surprising there).
Sigourney Weaver turns out yet another good performance, equaling her
portrayal of Ripley in ALIENS.  She was snubbed at the Oscars for this
one, mainly because the film was a critical bomb.  Her reactions are
far more realistic in this film, with her crying over the loss of the
little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter.
It's quite touching really.  Charles S. Dutton is very strong in his
performance as one of the inmates, and I was on the brink of actually
caring for him.  Charles Dance turns in a nice low-key performance,
and as a result, I cared for him immediately.  Lance Henriksen makes a
brief appearance as Bishop II, but he was more entertaining in ALIENS.
The rest of the cast is pretty stale, though Pete Postlethwaite sticks
out due to his recent turns in THE USUAL SUSPECTS and THE LOST WORLD.
ALIEN 3 is rated R for strong violence and language, and sex.
Although it has its flaws, ALIEN 3 is highly entertaining with rich
symbolism.  This film reminds you how much fun it is to spot
metaphorical images throughout a movie.  While Kubrick may have a
moral message throughout his films, Fincher relies on cinematic
devices to bring his meanings out.  It's a film like Fincher's which
reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for
quantity (the final scene).  In fact, it tells us that we, as a
society, have become too critical of things which may happen to look a
little "fake."  Whenever something looks fake on screen, we
immediately point it out as a mistake.  But perhaps it isn't a
mistake.

     Well, if it isn't the season for sequels.  ALIEN 3 and LETHAL
WEAPON 3 are currently playing in the theaters.  HONEY, I BLEW UP THE
KID and BATMAN RETURNS are coming to the theaters during the summer.
CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH 2: SUBHUMANOID MELTDOWN, WAXWORK 2: LOST IN TIME,
and VICE ACADEMY 3 (all direct to video releases I think) just recently
hit video.  I just saw ALIEN 3 and I hope to soon see LETHAL WEAPON 3.
     All of the survivors of ALIENS, except for Sigourney Weaver, die,
when their life support pods crash on a planet.  The planet is an old
maximum security prison, where all the prisoners have taken a vow of
celibacy.  An alien facehugger had snuck into the pod ship and is now in
the prison.
     I was rather disappointed with ALIEN 3.  I feel that ALIEN, a
five-star movie, is one of the best horror/sci-fi flicks out and that
ALIENS, a four star movie, is a good sci-fi film.  I was expecting a
wonderful film for ALIEN 3 filled with elaborate sets, a great
continuation of the alien story, and great special effects.   Two out of
three aren't bad, the sets were great and I have no complaints about the
special effects.  The story, however, leaves something to be desired.
On a scale of zero to five, I give ALIEN 3 a three.  ALIEN 3 is rated R
for graphic violence and explicit language.
     Basically I enjoyed seeing ALIEN 3, the problem being that the film
got marred by the story line.  The story for ALIEN 3 looks like it was
thrown together and released because the producers figured that people
would flock to see another alien movie.  Well, people, at least in my
town, are flocking to see the movie.  I think the 9:30 PM showing I went
to got sold out.
     The acting in the movie is great.  Charles S. Dutton (of FOX's
"ROC" and MISSISSIPPI MASALA) is my favorite person in the film.   Even
though he is a prisoner he seems to have the most caring and compassion,
although sometimes he doesn't show it.  Lance Henriksen (Bishop in
ALIENS) is back, although this time as the creator of Bishop.  Sigourney
Weaver is starting to get a little tiresome.  Of course, the alien is
great!
     If the first two alien movies hadn't been so good, or if this film
were standing alone, I think that it would have gotten a higher rating.
But it had a lot of expectations to live up to, and compared to the
other two alien movies, it doesn't fare too well.   I hope that there
will be no ALIEN 4 because I think that they have run out of good ideas.
     The Alien films have been very highly spoofed.  Part of the reason
for this is that the it has been such a good series that almost
everybody has seen at least one of the films.  ALIEN has been spoofed in
films like Mel Brooks's SPACEBALLS and on television in shows like, the
British comedy series "Red Dwarf," and I seem to remember a "Saturday
Night Live" skit spoofing ALIEN.
     I highly suggest that if you plan to see this film, that you
re-watch ALIEN and ALIENS, for this film takes off where ALIENS left
off.  I do see no reason why you should go to the theater to see this
film.  It is marginal whether it is worth seeing at a theater, but would
probably be worth seeing on video.

******MINOR PLOT SPOILERS IN REVIEW*******
*****NO MAJOR SPOILERS ARE IN REVIEW******
     The previous two "Alien" films have each had their own unique
styles to them.  The Ridley Scott's ALIEN was very much a stylistic
suspense film.  James Cameron's ALIENS was much more of an action film.
And I liked each film separately for which it was.  Now ALIEN 3 is
out.  And it is it's own film in the same right that ALIEN and ALIENS
were.
     Unlike ALIENS, ALIEN 3 requires that you have seen ALIENS.  This is
very important as the story picks up exactly were ALIENS left off.  The
survivors of the expedition to LV-426 are returning home after battling
and beating the Aliens.  The climactic fight scene between Ripley and
the Mother Alien on the Sulaco in ALIENS left behind one item, an egg.
In the opening sequence we see the egg hatch, find its quarry, which
leads to a fire aboard the Sulaco when the facehugger is injured, an
leads the Sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel.
This vessel crash lands on Fury 109.  Everyone in the vessel is killed,
except Ripley.  The facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the
crash.
     Fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison.  When closed
down, some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the
remaining years on the planet.  All the prisoners are men who have not
seen a woman in many years.  Ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the
inmates.  As for the new haircut that Ripley and the prisoner's sport,
there is an infestation of lice on the planet.  Being an ex-prison means
that there is no way off the planet and no weapons.  So the prisoners
and Ripley are off to face the Alien on their own.
     I will not go into detail, but you can guess what happens here.
The Alien is loose and no one believes Ripley's outstanding story.  She
finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor.  Yes, after 57 years
Ripley has sex.  It is not gratuitous, in fact, we don't even see them
kiss, but it is just as well.  A sweaty sex scene would not have worked
in the context of the film.
     There is a lot more gore in ALIEN 3.  In fact I would guess to say
that there is more in ALIEN 3 than either of the earlier two.  It also
sports a new Alien with 4 legs!  I won't say how, but it leads us to
believe a few new things about the Alien and its cycle, which I am sure
will be explored in ALIEN 4.
     Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley and provides another excellent
performance of this character.  Her scene during the autopsy of Newt is
enough to garnish her another academy nomination.  The rest of the cast
is also quite good.  Notably, Charles Dance as the doctor with whom
Ripley finds momentary escape from Fury 109.
     ALIEN 3 has a very distinct look.  This is due largely to its
director, David Fincher.  Mr. Fincher, who until now has only directed
music videos and commercials, has done an incredible job here.  His
direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no
"Alien" film has before.  For Mr. Fincher, I see a long prosperous
career ahead of him.
     The music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry.  Elliot
Goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the
claustrophobic setting that the "Alien" series been set in.  This time
the score is not so much a rip off of STAR TREK II (James Horner's
ALIENS).  This score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself
to the old style of Ennio Morricone scoring.  This is a great score.
     The ending to ALIEN 3 is quite good.  There were times I thought
that Hollywood would come in and screw it up, but it played very nicely.
I will not ruin the ending for you.  Go see the film.  I consider it to
be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far
this season.  ALIEN 3 is a worthy successor to ALIENS and ALIEN.  And
when they make ALIEN 4, perhaps they will be able to find yet another new
direction to take it in.
