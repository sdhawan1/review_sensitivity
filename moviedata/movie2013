   The paradox of "The Hi-Lo Country" is that in many ways it
resembles the old-fashioned western with its scenes in a
saloon, the interminable fist-fights, the assertive females; and
yet it departs from the genre in so many others.  For one
particular, the lines between good guys and bad are not so
clear-cut.  For another, it does not depict one lone gunfighter
as hero, but opts instead to be a buddy movie about two men
who are so tight that they would die for each other.  In yet
another route, perhaps the most significant one, it
demonstrates its director's preoccupation with showing a
historic crossroads that took the last frontier into the
corporate age, much to the regret of those who would like to
think of the American West as our last remnant of
individualism.  Significantly it is directed by
Stephen Frears, a British helmer brought up in the city of
Leicester who looks at the heartland of America from an
outsider's point of view with the understanding that only a
disinterested third party can bring.  "The Hi-Lo Country" is a
picture that can fascinate the most die-hard urbanite, the sort
of dude who thought that westerns were strictly for the
kiddies.  It could enchant even New Yorkers who believe that
if you sail west on the Hudson you'd simply fall off the edge.
   What is the source of this charm?  Part of the secret is in
the fortuitous casting of Woody Harrelson, whose role as an
architect in a previous picture was more indecent than the
proposal of the title.  Out of place there as Demi Moore's
wife, he is right at home in Hi-Lo country where the Texas-
born, fair-haired lad who made a name for himself in the TV
series "Cheers" is a natural on a horse--roping steers, and
causing mayhem throughout the countryside.  By equipping
Billy Crudup as his diametrical opposite  and yet credibly
showing how the two got along so famously, director Frears
succeeds admirably in underscoring the surprises that
incongruity can convey.  Some exquisite photography on
location in New Mexico, particularly in the long shots of a
cattle roundup, gives the film its nostalgic kick: a sight or two
to symbolize the end of an era when the region of hard-
drinking Marlboro men gives way to the turf of corporate agri-
business, in which cattle get shipped by current but decidedly
unromantic methodology.
   What drives the story forward is the interest that the two
fast friends have in the same woman.  At a time that the
nation's strong young men shipped out to Europe and the Far
East during World War II leaving behind a surplus of newly
aggressive, man-hungry women, Mona (Patricia Arquette)
settled in marriage for a man she could barely stand.  No
sooner did the boys come home in 1945 then she cast her
eyes and then some on handsome, Pete (Billy Crudup), a
strong, silent type also pursued by his regular girl friend
Josepha (Penelope Cruz).  Obsessed by his desire for Mona,
Pete is crushed when Mona shifts her devotion to Pete's best
buddy and riding partner, Big Boy (Woody Harrelson), a self-
destructive, macho man who looks death in the eye without
fear but who is just slightly domesticated by the woman
whose body he compares not unfavorably to that of his best
horse.
   Stephen Frears, effectively, nay triumphantly, transforming
a novel by Max Evans, portrays the New West which is
evolving while the passion of its characters plays out.  Cattle
Baron Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliot) is buying up land, even
forcing out reluctant cowboys with the blessing of the local
magistrates.  Love has earned the contempt of the
townspeople, who celebrate Pete's powerful fists as they land
with fury on the Ed Love's henchmen.  Pete's disdain does
not stop on his doorstep, as he scorns his own kid brother,
Little Boy (Cole Hauser), for staying home during the war and
working for the detested buyer.
   According to critic David Thomsen, Stephen Frears once
said that he does not enjoy working in America, but you'd not
know it from this picture.  This movie comes across as a
paen, a joyous ode to the majesty of the big country, to an
area that the director's compatriots must look at with envy
from their tight little island.  Perhaps the covetous English
look with vindictive glee on the very technology that has
transformed the land of Big Boy into the terra firma of a more
productive but obviously less interesting corporate
agribusiness.  At any rate, that's the impression you take
away from this large, brawling, lusty film which boasts nothing
short of mythic resonance.

The film opens with a very tense Pete Calder (Billy Crudup) who
pulls up in a battered old pickup outside a church. In voice-over,
he states his intention to kill a man. The rest of the movie
relates how Pete got to this point. It begins with how he met his
best friend 'Big Boy' Matson (Woody Harrelson), who, like Pete,
owns a small ranch in Hi-Lo. They hang out together, drink and
womanise together and, when WWII begins, join the Army together.
When they return from service, they find that their holdings are
hardly sufficient to make a living. They are cowboys, but life has
changed. Ranchers such as Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliot) own huge tracts
of land, and employ former ranchers to work as hired hand. Trucks
have replaced the cattle drive as a means of getting the herd to
the train stations. To Big Boy and Pete, Jim Ed is an object of
contempt - while they were away fighting, he stayed at home buying
up land, getting rich and slowly destroying the culture and
position of the cowboy. What's worse, Big Boy's younger brother,
Little Boy (Cole Hauser) now works for Jim Ed.
When Pete returns to Hi-Lo, his first act is to go to a dance in
a nearby town, in the hope of meeting his former girlfriend, a
Latino beauty called Josepha (Pen√©lope Cruz). Instead he bumps
into Mona (Patricia Arquette) who flirts openly with him, though
she is married to Jim Ed Love's foreman, Les Birk (John Deihl).
Though he later meets Josepha, Pete cannot get Mona from his mind.
He is determined to see her again, and feels that she wants to
take their relationship further, despite professing his love and
loyalty to Josepha. He is horrified when he finds out that Big
Boy is having an affair with Mona, particularly as Big Boy uses
Pete to help him keep the affair a secret. As Big Boy becomes
more smitten with Mona, Pete's secret passion for her also
builds unbearably, as does his guilt for deceiving Josepha.
Pete and Big Boy, though close friends, have very different
characters - Big Boy is loud, brash and passionate, whereas
Pete keeps his emotions and thoughts to himself. He is as cautious
as Big Boy is impulsive. The festering resentment between Jim Ed's
men and the independent ranchers begins to boil over as news of
Big Boy's affair becomes known. As Big Boy becomes more prosperous,
he becomes more reckless, as if to invite confrontation, while
Pete is torn between trying to protect his friend and also
his desire to betray him (by taking Mona).
Director Stephen Frears clearly loves the landscape and the story.
The Hi-Lo Country is a beautifully filmed Western, and his direction
won the Best Direction prize at the Berlin film festival this year,
and is accompanied by a stirring score by Carter Burwell (who also
scored Fargo). The story (based on a book by Max Evans) poignantly
evokes the sunset of the working cowboy era, as well as the strains
of loving in a small, rural community (echoing the work of novelists
Cormac Carthy and Larry McMurty).
Both Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup are completely authentic as
both cowboys and best friends, and their relationship forms the
emotional axis upon which the film revolves. However, the film is
far less convincing in the depiction of Arquette's character,
Mona. So little effort is made to portray her as a real character
that it is difficult to see why she evokes such passion in both
men. Since Mona only kisses Pete once, it is a bit of a stretch
to comprehend why he should harbour such desire for her, since the
woman who does love him (Josepha) is far more beautiful and
interesting. Likewise, it is never apparent why Big Boy would
risk his life and livelihood for Mona either.
The other cause of conflict which drives the film is the
relationship between Big Boy and his brother which lurches from
anger to affection and back to outright hatred from scene to
scene in an incomprehensible manner. It's as if all the fraternal
scenes were scattered at random throughout the film, without
regard what had happened before or after in the story. The uneven
tone of this subplot is particularly evident at the climax of the
movie, and the final, important scene between the brothers seems
to have almost no bearing on what had gone before.
The performances are generally excellent throughout, particularly
Harrelson and Crudup, as well as the secondary characters, such
as Elliot (as the machiavellian Jim Ed Love) and Rosaleen Linehan
as the mother of the feuding brothers. Frear's previous work
includes The Grifters and Dangerous Liasons, so he knows something
about stories of deception and illicit love affairs. However, this
film feels like it has been heavily edited, at the expense of the
characters of both Mona and Little Boy. The result is that one
feels like is hearing the story second-hand, with the best bits
left out.

THE HI-LO COUNTRY (M).  
(Polygram/Palace)
Director: Stephen Frears
Stars: Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Arquette, James Gammon, 
Cole Hauser, Sam Elliott, 
Penelope Cruz, John Diehl, Enrique Castillo, Lane Smith, Rosaleen Linehan
Running time: 129 minutes.
Although The Hi-Lo Country is set in the harsh, untamed cattle
country of New Mexico in the late 1940's, it quickly becomes obvious
that we are venturing into Sam Peckinpah territory here.  The Hi- Lo
Country explores many of those themes common to his movies - the death
of the old west and its values, and that strange code of loyalty that
exists between hard and violent men.
Peckinpah tried in vain for many years to bring Max Evans'
1961 novel to the screen.  Producers Martin Scorsese and Barbara De
Fina have succeeded where Peckinpah failed.  Walon Green (who wrote
The Wild Bunch, one of the all-time classic westerns and one of my
favourite films) has fashioned a grand, sweeping epic from Evans'
novel, although some elements are far less compelling than others.
Scorsese has brought aboard British director Stephen Frears (My
Beautiful Laundrette, etc), with whom he collaborated on the
marvellous noir-like thriller The Grifters.
An outsider, Frears directs the material with unusual
intelligence.  He doesn't romanticise the characters or the setting as
much as Peckinpah would have.  The film also lacks Peckinpah's
characteristic trade mark touches - the graphic violence and the
strong misogynistic streak.  Oliver Stapleton's glorious wide screen
cinematography beautifully brings to life the harsh open spaces of New
Mexico, imbuing the film with an almost epic quality.
Many young men, returning home from Europe following the war,
found the old cattle country had changed drastically during their
absence.  Many families facing hardship and financial ruin had been
forced to sell their farms to wealthy land barons.  Deprived of their
legacy, the young men were often forced to work for these wealthy
ranchers for wages.  Pete Calder (Billy Crudup, from Inventing The
Abbotts, etc) is one such returning soldier, who prefers to work his
own modest 1600 acres, with help from his friend Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson).
Big Boy though is a tough, hard drinking cowboy of the old
school, an embodiment of the old west, who doesn't walk away from a
fight.  He courts trouble when he begins an increasingly public affair
with Mona (Patricia Arquette), the wife of Les Birk (John Diehl),
foreman for ruthless local rancher Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott).  It's an
affair that can only end in violence and tragedy.
Crudup gives a solid performance as Pete, the laconic,
introspective narrator of this nostalgic tale.  Harrelson somehow
seems miscast here in a role that required an actor with a meaner,
rougher edge.  Arquette lends her sultry presence to the pivotal role
of Mona.
The Hi-Lo Country is best viewed as a poignant, elegiac homage
to both the classic western movies of yesteryear and, ultimately, the
late Peckinpah himself.

Susan Granger's review of "HI-LO COUNTRY" (Gramercy Pictures)
Leave it to an English director, Stephen Frears ("The
Grifters," "Dangerous Liaisons," "Mary Reilly'), to combine American
idealism with fading cowboy credos. Adapted by Walon Green ("The Wild
Bunch") from a 1961 novel by Max Evans, the story, set in a prairie
town called Hi-Lo in rural New Mexico, revolves around Woody Harrelson
as Big Boy Matson. He's still into hard livin' - drivin' cattle,
drinkin', fightin', and chasin' women - but - in the post W.W. II era
- he's out of place. He's like a demented Peter Pan, a boastful kid
who won't grow up. The story begins with Billy Crudup sitting in a van
with a shotgun across his lap, saying, "I once set out to kill
someone." Utilizing flashbacks, we learn the circumstances which led
up to his dilemma. Pivotal to the problem is his obsession with
flirtatious Patricia Arquette, who is unhappily married to a spineless
wimp and hot for his rough-and-ready best friend and business
partner. "A good woman is like a good horse 'n she's got bottom" is
the way Big Boy puts it.  Then there's wily Sam Elliott as a
cold-blooded, land-grabbing, wealthy rancher, an obvious
villain. "Trust is everything" is Big Boy's motto but, nevertheless,
their friendship is at stake.  All of this violent, macho turmoil is
set against Oliver Stapleton's magnificent big sky cinematography and
to the music of Carter Burdwell's evocative score.  It's no wonder
that the late Sam Peckinpah struggled for years to try to get this
picture made. Acting-wise, Harrelson and Crudup are bold and me
morable but Ms. Arquette is, at best, insipid. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hi-Lo Country" is a simmering 7, a lusty homespun
homage to the traditional Old West of John Ford and Howard Hawks.

The modern use of the western movie, and the western genre has almost
evaporated. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and Wild Wild West are some of the most
recent entries, both of them were bad, and this one is coming right along to
join them. What starts out like a promising desert film (Martin Scorsese is one
of the producers) turns into boring drech.
Pete Calder (Crudup, who was Steve Prefontaine in Without Limits) is new to
Hi-Lo, New Mexico. He's here to start his cattle business and quickly makes
friends with, oh, the western version of Woody Harrelson (and, what a surprise,
he's played by Woody Harrelson) his name is Big Boy and he's in the same
business. The two men constantly go to the bar, and celebrate the death of a
man that they beat in poker.
When Mona (Patricia Arquette) crosses through both of their lives, they are
both lovestruck and each of them begin their own private affairs. The men
struggle to keep their bonds alive while they are constantly drunk, herding
cattle, and making crude sexual references. (If this doesn't sound like a
classic western you're right.) The film follows the two men's lives until one
character dies, by the time we get there, we don't really care.
There are three problems in The Hi-Lo Country. One, Harrelson seems to have his
role written exactly for him. Rather than seeing Harrelson's Big Boy character
when I looked on the screen, I saw Woody Harrelson playing the same type of
Woody-ized character that he always plays. This also goes for Arquette, who's
role seems Patricia-ized for her and reminded me constantly of her Alice
character in Lost Highway. Two, the film is boring. So boring in fact, that I
believe my minutes of film to yawn ratio is 6:2. Three, The film plays in no
particular order, showing us a handful of random events that don't have any
meaning to what happens in the conclusion. Add some sappy drama, and you've got
another bad western, The Hi-Lo Country gets *  1/2 stars.
