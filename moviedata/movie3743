Cary Grant had to undergo various humiliations in many
of his comedies.  In "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream
House (1948)" he lurches from one disaster to another.
But the worst was yet to come.  In his next film,
"I Was a Male War Bride", he is a victim of multiple
physical gags, is repeatedly forced to sleep in
uncomfortable environments, and worst of all, must
dress up as a woman in order to board a ship.
Grant is a French Army officer (with no French accent)
who keeps getting assigned to work with American officer
Ann Sheridan.  Disguising their real feelings, they pretend
to dislike each other, leading to much insulting and
entertaining dialogue.  While working on a mission
to recruit a German lens-grinder, Grant gets into and
out of trouble, getting arrested, having a motorcycle
accident, etc.
Sheridan, a secret masochist, greatly enjoys Grant's
humiliations, some of which she actually instigates.
Eventually the two recognize their true feelings, and
get married.  But when Sheridan must return to the States,
Grant as an alien has only one recourse to return with her:
as Sheridan's war bride.
"I Was a Male War Bride" was the third of four comedies
starring Cary Grant that were directed by Howard Hawks.
All four films (the others were "Bringing Up Baby",
"His Girl Friday" and "Monkey Business") are excellent.
All but "Bringing Up Baby" had scripts credited to
Charles Lederer, whose talents never succeeded in
getting an Oscar nomination.  That's the trouble with
writing comedies, they're not taken seriously!
