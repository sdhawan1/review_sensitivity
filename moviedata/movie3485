Director Guy Ritchie is now best known as Madonna's husband, and that can 
either be a help or a hindrance to his career. His new film, "Snatch," is 
being advertised as such or as the ads proclaim, "check out Madonna's 
husband's new movie!" In truth, "Snatch" is a fun waste of time, a loud, 
obnoxious, jump-cut laden comic book of a movie. Though not nearly as good as 
Ritchie's debut, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," it is fitfully good 
enough. 
The incomprehensible plot has to do with an eighty-six carat diamond stolen 
by jewel thief Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), who has to deliver it 
to Avi (Dennis Farina), his boss in New York. The problem is that Franky has 
bets on a boxing match at a London bookie joint run by the wonderfully 
witty-mixed-with-toughness charm of a Russian gangster (Rade Serbedzija). 
Suddenly, a series of double crosses and frantic coincidences take place, 
involving some pawnbrokers, an excitable dog who swallows the sought-after 
diamond and a stuffed pig, a realistically brutal crime kingpin (Alan Ford), 
two boxing promoters (Jason Statham and Stephen Graham) and "Lock, Stock" 
returnee Vinny Jones as the appropriately named Bullet Tooth Tony. And there 
is the comedically engaging Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy with an accent so 
indiscernible that his own friends have to repeat his words so everyone can 
understand him. Obviously Pitt is doing riffs on his own questionable Irish 
accent in "The Devil's Own." 
"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" was a frenzied cartoon yet "Snatch" is 
even more frenzied. It is fraught with jump cuts, loud music, shotgun blasts 
galore, heavy British accents, graphic violence, Jewish v.s. African-American 
racist slurs, and just about everything else you think would offend and shock 
the arthouse crowd of safe, risk-free cinema. Not that "Snatch" is anything 
new or that it takes any real risks, but it sure will cause revulsion for 
people who support Sir Richard Attenborough. 
There are plenty of laughs and enough wicked black humor to make "Snatch" a 
decent evening out at the movies. Just do not expect coherence, only wild 
visual pyrotechnics and a helluva a good performance by Mr. Pitt.

 Snatch (2001) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Brad Pitt,Jason Statham,
Stephen Graham, Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Alan
Ford, Rade Sherbedgia and Mike Reid. Written and directed by Guy
Ritchie. Rated R.
 Snatch is a rollicking, violent offbeat outing that will leave you
gasping, laughing and perhaps  a bit outraged.
Written and directed by Guy Ritchie (yes, THAT Guy Ritchie), the movie
covers similar ground to Ritchieís breakthrough film of last year, Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
 Both films deal with not-too-bright underworld factions battling and
trying to double cross each other. Both are filled with mayhem and both
contain a cockeyed humor that is infectious even as you watch bodies
drop in droves.
 Snatch plays like one of those old Warner Bros. crime dramas from the
ë30s that so expertly melded gunplay with snappy patter. Only in Snatch,
you really have to pay attention since the story is set in England and
most of the cast speak quickly in those blue-collar British accents that
takes a while to pick up.
 Snatch ostensibly revolves around the theft of an 84-karat diamond in
Antwerp by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and some confederates.
 The theft of the diamond sparks the interest of a number of low-life
and not-very-nice characters with names such as Brick Top (Alan Ford),
Avi (Dennis Farina), Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), Boris "The Blade"
(Rade Sherbedgia) and Doug "The Head" (Mike Reid)
 Others on the periphery include novice unlicensed fight promoter
Turkish (Jason Statham), his partner, Tommy (Stephen Graham) and the
Gypsy bare-knuckle fighter, Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt).
 Ritchie unites these two worlds in his helter-skelter drama that seems
to be going in all directions, yet folds together neatly at the finale.
 One thing you can say about Ritchie, the man does not believe in a
linear narrative. Snatch jumps from person to person, place to place,
event to event without so much as a fade-out or iris.
 Ritchie has a natural affinity for these mugs and thugs. He doesnít
exactly treat them with respect or extol their virtues, but he does seem
to be winking at his audience, saying, ěYea, theyíre bad, they rob,
cheat and kill, but theyíre funny in a pathetic way.î
 He does not glamorize them like Coppolaís Corleone family or Scorseseís
Wise Guys. And that may be because in Ritchieís underworld, the
gangsters are only half as smart as they think they are.
 Snatchís plot contrivances and double-dealings are too convoluted to
explain in print. Just take my word, that you will have a rousing good
time at Snatch, even as you try to follow its various threads.
 As for the performers, Statham keeps a level head as the promoter
merely trying to stay alive; Pitt is nearly incomprehensible, jabbering
rapidly with a brogue that would make Barry Fitzgerald blush; while Ford
nearly steals the movie as the gangster kingpin-pig farmer who sometimes
serves his animals some special feed in order to get rid of evidence.
 Snatch is no Sunday picnic. It is at times bloody and brutal. Yet it
also has an innate, childish charm, almost a tongue-in-cheek quality in
which Ritchie seems to be saying that none of what you are watching
should be taken seriously.
I know I didnít ó because I was too busy laughing.

PLOT:
Wow, this is gonna be a tough one. Okay, there are these two boxing
promoters who get caught up in a diamond heist gone awry, in which a young
gambling addict gets kidnapped by these guys who were hired by a Russian
gangster to retrieve the stolen diamond in question. Still with me? Okay,
the promoters also lose their prize fighter, who ends up being replaced by
an unintelligible bare-knuckle gypsy boxer, and suddenly find themselves at
the mercy of a ruthless gangster who's strong-arming them to fix the fight
or end up at the bottom of a river. All of these cool folks eventually run
into one another and rage plenty of more crime, violence and heavy accents
onto our laps. Got all that? Aaaaah, forget it...just see the movie, dammit!
CRITIQUE:
Definitely a major feeling of deja-vu round these parts, but not enough to
spoil yet another solid Guy Ritchie (also known as Mr. Madonna) British
underground gangster funfest. The accents are heavy, the characters are
colorful and the style is all over the place, and perfect for a movie as
such. Yeah, yeah...I know you've probably read this elsewhere, but I can't
review this movie without mentioning LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS at
least once. What I wanted to say was that if you liked LOCK, you will more
than likely enjoy this movie. They've got similar overall premises, wild and
crazy characters, funky soundtracks, over-the-top style shots, etc, etc...
If that film wasn't your bag, I highly doubt that you will appreciate this
film either. Vinnie Jones kicks arse!!
The few issues I did have with this film were actually pretty small, but
I'll mention them anyway. The breadth of characters was just a little too
much for my taste. I loved Del Toro's character, Brad Pitt's, Dennis
Farina's and Vinnie Jones', but at some point, there were just too many of
them to juggle. So when the story would switch over to the two boxing
promoters, I wasn't as "into it" as I was with the hipper characters. Same
with the story lines, which took a little too long to get going because of
this very fact. I also missed a few lines here and there due to the accent
thing (no, not Brad Pitt's twang, I understand that he was supposed to be
incoherent!), and the said feeling of deja-vu, but all those smaller issues
aside, I enjoyed the flick and that's the bottom line. I especially loved
the first 15 minutes with the original credit sequence and freeze-frame
title card intros and only wish there was more of Del Toro to spread
around...like in his own movie or something! Anyhoo, chalk it up to yet
another highly stylized caper spitting out rounds of violence, humor and
fun-loving criminals for the MTV masses looking for good times and bad
muthas. The film's tag line of "Stealin' Stones and Breakin' Bones" is a
good one.
Note to Guy Ritchie: You've proven yourself to be quite adept in this genre
of film, but it would be nice to see you take a shot at something completely
different for your next film. Then again, let us remind ourselves that I am
but a simpleminded critic typing out words in the basement of the house in
which my parents still reside. Sigh.
Where's JoBlo coming from?
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (7.5/10) - Pulp Fiction (7.5/10) -
Reservoir Dogs (9/10) - True Romance (10/10) - The Usual Suspects (7.5/10)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Pay close attention and you will hear Madonna's "Lucky Star" playing during
a scene in which Vinnie Jones drags a certain someone by his car with his
head tucked in his window.
Incidentally, that "certain someone" is none other than Ewen Bremner, a man
some of you will remember for having played the loveable character of Spud
in TRAINSPOTTING.
The working title of this film was DIAMONDS.

Fans of Guy Ritchie's 1998 cult fave
_Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ will be happy to learn that
shacking up with Madonna and siring her a son have had no discernible
effect on the writer-director--at least not one noticeable in his second
film, _Snatch_.  (There is, however, one blatant concession to the union,
and that is the prominent placement of the Material Girl's vintage tune
"Lucky Star"--hardly a bad thing, if you ask me.)  In fact, nothing
appears to have affected or changed Ritchie at all between this latest
film and his last, for _Snatch_ is a full-throttle comedic crime caper
that more than resembles _Lock,_Stock..._ yet remains a rollicking good
time in its own right.
Like _Lock,_Stock..._ and just about every other entry in the
neo-noir-laffer genre, _Snatch_ takes an assortment of eccentric
characters and tosses them in a blender of danger, double-cross, dark
comedy, and a dog (OK, the last element is specific to this film).  Our
guide through the convolutions of this twisty tale is Turkish (Jason
Statham), an unlicensed boxing promoter who is business partners and best
friends with Tommy (Stephen Graham), who is in the slot machine business.
 When Turkish and Tommy's plans to fix a fight for bigwig Brick Top (Alan
Ford) go horribly awry, thus begins a chain of chaos that links with a
large stolen diamond.
This is but a short strand of the knotty yarn that is woven in _Snatch_,
not to mention an even smaller sampling of the shady sons-of-bitches that
populate Ritchie's grimy London underworld.  In addition to the
pig-farm-owning, dog-fight-loving Brick Top, there's hard-to-kill Russian
badass Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia); Sol (Lennie James) and Vincent
(Robbie Gee), pawnbrokers who, along with heavyset getaway driver Tyrone
(Ade), make an inept robbery team; Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an Irish
gypsy bare-knuckle brawler with an unintelligible accent; Doug "the Head"
(Mike Reid), a gentile jeweler who pretends he's Jewish to benefit
business; American crook Avi (Dennis Farina), who gets the ball rolling
by hiring ace thief Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to steal that
big ol' diamond.
With such a large canvas of players--and there are more than a few
others I haven't mentioned--it is indeed difficult at first to keep track
of them, even after each one is stylishly introduced with a freeze-frame
title card.  What doesn't take so long, however, is getting caught up in
these colorful characters and the swirl of events that sweep them
together.  Ritchie's stylized visuals do bear a show-offy sheen, but
there's no denying the eye candy makes an effective initial hook.
And once hooked, it isn't so much Ritchie's consistently interesting
visuals that keeps the audience interested than his clever,
unpredictable, breakneck plotting and memorably off-center characters. 
He can't take full responsibility for the latter matter, though, for most
of the credit must go to the actors.  While Del Toro's Franky is another
of his tiresome, trademark marble-mouths, Pitt makes shockingly good use
of his character's verbal tic, the basis of many a good laugh.  Ford,
Farina, Ade, Gee, and James also make their mark without the benefit (or
hindrance) of a funky accent.  Providing a welcome center of calm amid
all the quirkiness is the quietly captivating Statham.
With its considerable similarities in style and tone with
_Lock,_Stock..._, _Snatch_ cannot be considered a real creative step
forward for Ritchie; the film doesn't reveal anything especially new
about his ability (except, perhaps, his effective direction of
bigger-name actors).  That said, I do think _Snatch_ is a step _up_;
while Ritchie essentially covers the same ground he did in that last
film, here he does it with more confidence and panache.  But given his
obvious talent and potential as a filmmaker, here's hoping Ritchie
doesn't trap himself in this scuzzy/funny crime milieu--though if he
continues to work the genre, let's hope he can do so with the same level
of energy and imagination.  (opens December 6 in Los Angeles for one week
only; opens everywhere January 19)

Turkish (Jason Statham, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") and his 
partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are boxing promoters whose desire
for a new caravan plummets them into the nefarious dealings of fight fixing,
hit men, gun dealers, Piker gypsys, pawnbrokers, gamblers, 
body guards and dishonest diamond dealers from both sides of the Atlantic in 
writer/director Guy Ritchie's ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels")
"Snatch."
Ritchie's kinetic first film was a smash in his homeland, but only a cult
success in the U.S.  With "Snatch" he follows much the same formula but
brings in recognizable stars, most notably Brad Pitt as Mickey, an almost
incomprehensible Irish bare knuckle fighter who loves his mum (Sorcha Cusack).
The film begins with four Hassidic Jews gaining entry into an Antwerp jewelry
exchange - moments later Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro, "Traffic")
and his gang have absconded with the 86 caret stone that will change hands
repeatedly.  Frankie works for Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina, "Reindeer
Games") in NY, who contacts Doug the Head (Mike Reid) in London to
help bring Frankie in.  Frankie, it seems, has a weakness for girls and
gambling.  Frankie's London weapons contact, Boris the Blade
(Rade Serbedzija, "Eyes Wide Shut") is planning on robbing Frankie for
Brick Top (Alan Ford, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"), a ruthless
fight fixer.  
Meanwhile, Turkish and Tommy's fighter Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty)
is pummelled when pitted against the wily Mickey (Brad Pitt), so they
anger and become indebted to Brick Top by changing their fighter - to Mickey.
Pawnbroker Sol (Lennie James, "Among Giants"), his buddy Vinny (Robbie Gee,
"The Firm") and oversize, unskilled driver Tyrone (Ade) are like three Black 
Stooges who try to pull the Blade's job and run afoul of Brick Top.  Former 
soccer pro Vinny Jones ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") appears as
Bullet Tooth Tony, bodyguard to Brick Top and legendary hit man.
The pace is fast and furious, featuring editting montages (Jon Harris and
Les Healey) comprised of stills (Frankie's pleasure exploits) and near-stills 
(Cousin Avi's trip to London shown in two seconds flat) that are hilariously 
economical.  Ritchie even gets a "Run Lola Run" moment when he shows a
fateful dual car crash from opposite perspectives back to back.  Urgent
cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels")
humorously captures the action, and, occasionally, sublime moments, like
when Mickey apparently floats horizontally through the air after a viscious
ring punch.
Ritchie's assembled a terrific ensemble here, from unknowns like Ford, who's
magnificently malicious and wickedly witty, to big stars like Pitt, who
shines here in a humorous offshoot of his "Fight Club" persona.  Ritchie's 
script may follow a formula, but his lines are deliciously inventive. 
(My favorite - when Brick Top asks 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, 
come again?').  Baby faced Tommy continues to wonder at the irony that 
has him and Turkish buying an ever more splendid and expensive caravan for 
Mickey when they originally went to him to purchase a used one.  Kudos, too,
to the unnamed Pikey pit bull whose loyalty brings luck.
Be warned - for all its humor, the film features extreme violence and some
gore, but simply put, "Snatch" is a blast.

The heist of a flawless, 84 carat diamond, fixed bare knuckle fights, Irish 
gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director Guy Ritchies's 
sophomore feature, "Snatch." 
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" intro'd helmer/scripter Ritchie with 
a hyper-kinetic, in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's 
attention from beginning to end. His protagonists were innocents set adrift 
in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive. With "Snatch," the director 
doesn't remake his first work, but he does delve more deeply into the 
criminal underbelly of London, mining a rich collection of characters in 
the process. 
>From the very beginning, "Snatch" tosses you into the action with the theft 
of the fabulous diamond, the desire of New York gangster Avi (Dennis 
Farina). En route from Antwerp, diamond thief and courier Frankie Four 
Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) stops in London to make a separate deal with 
Avi's partner and cousin, Doug "The Head" (Mike Reid). Frankie's addiction 
to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for 
Boris "The Blade" (Rade Sherbedgia), a ruthless Russian mobster. The bet 
turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - 
Vinnie (Robbie Gee), Sol (Lennie James) and portly Tyrone (Ade)- that goes 
miserably awry. 
Meanwhile, a couple of young toughs, Turkish (Jason Stratham) and Tommy 
(Stephen Graham), are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help 
of local villain Brick Top (Alan Ford), who also owns a pig farm. When 
their first fighter is put out of action, with one punch, by a wild Irish 
gypsy named Mickey O'Neil, they figure to put the loose canon in as the 
contender in a fixed fight. Mickey proves less than reliable and goes 
against Turkish and Tommy's deal. Brick Top, impressed by Mickey's 
performance, decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining 
that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse. 
When Avi doesn't get his precious rock, he jumps on a plane for London and 
hires a local legend, "Bullet Tooth" Tony (Vinnie Jones), to find Frankie 
and the diamond. Things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a 
collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a 
squeaky toy. 
Guy Ritchie (Mr. Madonna to some) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who 
has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast 
and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the 
characters' mouths like machine gun fire. The helmer marshals his large 
ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh 
and feel queasy at the same time, the above description by Brick Top being 
just one example. 
The assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives 
"Snatch" an earthy feel in its depiction of London's criminal underworld. 
The cast of characters is too large to credit here, but two of the 
performances - first among equals, you might say - are worth noting. Alan 
Ford is brilliant as the ruthless, evil Brick Top. When he refuses sugar in 
his tea because "I'm sweet enough," it makes you shiver, even as you laugh. 
His is one of the best gangster characters I've seen in years. 
The other outstanding perf is given by none other than Brad Pitt, the name 
actor the movie's popularity may hang upon, at least initially. Pitt, as 
Mickey O'Neil, is hard drinking, hard fighting, highly unreliable and 
nearly incomprehensible with a unique Irish brogue and dialect of the 
pikers, the Irish travelers of Europe. This gypsy brigand would steal the 
fillings from your teeth, especially if it would benefit his beloved mum 
(Sorcha Cusack). When Brick Top threaten the safety of Mickey's family, he 
makes an enemy that cannot be stopped. Pitt puts a credible spin on his 
character and does some incredible physical stuff, too, as a bare-knuckle 
boxer. 
The production team behind the camera includes Ritchie alumni, producer 
Matthew Vaughn and lenser Tim Maurice-Jones, and other talented technical 
artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life. 
There is a patent feel to the look of "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two 
Smoking Barrels" that reeks of "signature" for Ritchie, but I'm not sure 
how this will translate in his future works. There is so much talent in the 
filmmaker that I would like to see him branch out in other directions. 
Nonetheless, "Snatch" is terrific sophomore effort, a darn good action 
comedy and a hoot to boot. I give it a B+.

     Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, couldn't have timed his recent
marriage any better.  Intentional or not, it came a mere week before the
opening of his new film Snatch, the follow-up to his Lock, Stock & Two
Smoking Barrels.  With Madonna as a willing shill, you couldn't ask for
better publicity.
     Turns out you didn't need it, Guy.  Snatch is a film that stands
perfectly on its own merits while it shoots bullet holes in everything
in sight.
     A more violent film you aren't likely to see this year (and yes, I
realize it's only January).  In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting,
and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element,
revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would
give his right arm for.  (And in one case, I mean that literally.)
     After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and
multi-crosses, Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem --
and how will they get it?  Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with
Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to
kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish
jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled
boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost
his bark.
     It's Ritchie's incredible, perfectly matched cast that makes the
film work so well.  It's hard to say who is best: Alan Ford's menacing
Brick Top, who feeds his victims to his pigs when they cross him; Vinnie
Jones (Gone in 60 Seconds) as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who
chills his prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro's
caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina's Anglophobe
jeweler; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their
roles.  In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still
buff from Fight Club, as a mush-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages
to get one step ahead of the crowd.
     Cut these guys together with a zippy story (that doesn't always
feel like it makes sense, but no matter) and a jazzy-techno soundtrack
(plus Mrs. Ritchie's "Lucky Star"), and there's nothing to dislike
here.  Even Ritchie's over-aggressive filmmaking never gets that
tiresome, though he runs through the entire pantheon of MTV camera
tricks: slow motion, fast motion, stop motion, reverse motion, low
angles, high angles, upside down camerawork, and more.
     Of course, Snatch does not secretly harbor a touching tale of
redemption, a theme of crooks who go straight, or any other sort of guts
that might make us think differently about the world when we leave the
movie theater.  In fact, it's not really about anything.  Unlike
contemporaries like Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting, with their messages
hidden away amongst all the action, Snatch is just a good time.  That's
not a bad thing, just don't try telling me that Snatch is deep.

Blood and guns.  SNATCH is the second feature film by writer and 
director Guy Ritchie, who blasted onto the film scene a couple of years 
ago with his audacious LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  His latest 
movie is a hyper-violent, screwball comedy that doesn't pull any 
punches.  And it's fun for a time until the repetition factor sets in.  
Coming from the more-is-always-better school of filmmaking, Ritchie 
tries to fill every fast-paced scene with maximum violence and mayhem.
SNATCH, which has more characters and overlapping stories that you can 
count, never has a slow moment.  Most of the main stories revolve around 
an 86-caret diamond stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) 
from Antwerp diamond dealers.  After stealing it, he keeps the diamond 
in a briefcase, which is always attached by a chain to his arm.  In the 
predictable script, you can probably guess exactly how he will be 
relieved of the stone.  
The other major story involves an illegal, no-holds-barred boxing 
matching featuring an unintelligible gypsy named One Punch Mickey (Brad 
Pitt).  One of many links between the two stories is an indestructible 
Russian gun dealer named Boris The Blade (Rade Serbedzija).  Many of the 
characters, like Boris, can take more bullets than the agents in THE 
MATRIX and still keep on coming.  The make-up department for SNATCH must 
have had to buy fake blood by the barrels.
Individual incidents are cute although few rise to the level of 
laugh-out-loud funny.  Typical is the gag involving a trio of two-bit 
crooks, played by Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade.  They have a pesky 
dog who swallows a toy, which causes him forever after to squeak rather 
than bark.
Rising to the top of the list of the characters who quickly get tiresome 
is Brick Top (Alan Ford), a nefarious boxing promoter who has man-eating 
pigs.  Animal rights people may find many of the fighting animal scenes 
more than they can stomach even if the movie undoubtedly promises that 
no animals were harmed, etc.
As the ending credits roll, the song it plays has the constant refrain, 
"Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha."  The movie is like that -- way too 
repetitive.
SNATCH runs 1:43.  It is rated R for strong violence, language and some 
nudity and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.

Keywords: author=polenz
Well, it's kinda hard to explain. It's centered around a collective circle of 
British gangsters who are all in one way or another trying to get their hands 
on a huge diamond the size of a peach. The movie jumps back and forth between 
four individual stories with their own subplots to bring it all together 
through excellent editing and direction. It's a macabre crime flick in the 
spirit of "Pulp Fiction," or "Get Shorty," but with that zany European twist 
to give it an original, fresh outlook. You're not really expected to follow 
the story to the letter since there's about a dozen main characters and the 
plot constantly twists and turns, the film is about the ride of it all. 
I haven't seen such a good mix of direction, editing and screenplay in quite 
a few years. It's such a welcomed change of pace compared to all the 
countless Quentin Tarantino wannabes (ahem - Christopher McQuarrie). 
I really enjoyed how "Snatch" is a mix of so many different characters who 
are all connected in some way but don't really know it. I usually have a 
difficult time trying to keep track of an ensemble cast so director Guy 
Ritchie does us a favor by introducing all the characters at the beginning by 
telling you who they are and what role they play in the British criminal 
underground. No heavy taxing on the brain that way! 
The British accents can often be indecipherable (and I don't just mean Brad 
Pitt's character). The actual story is quite a challenge to properly follow 
and the ending is a bit more violent and cliche than it needed to be. 
Excellent performances by Pitt and the entire cast make the film a success. 
When you're making a crime movie that's supposed to be funny at times and 
deadly serious at other times you'd better have good actors who can pull off 
both comedy and drama smoothly. 
I really enjoyed the editing and direction of the film, even if the story was 
a bit tricky. In fact, I can't help but think it was purposely written so 
complicated to make us THINK it's really a piece of brilliance. I mean, this 
is a crime movie at the core so often the action and sheer carnal violence 
are the driving forces. 
So you want a rollercoaster ride at the movies? "Snatch" is just that, 
exciting, funny, suspenseful, always entertaining and creative as could be. 
Falls a little flat at the end but that's forgivable. Will very likely be on 
my top ten list for 2001 and is best movie of the year thus far.

Quentin Tarantino had the good sense to step back after the world ate up
the cinematic feast that was Pulp Fiction (that is, if you don't count
his forgettable appearances as an actor).  Or maybe the three and a half
years between Fiction's Golden Palm win at Cannes and the release of
Jackie Brown just seemed like an eternity.  While Brown wasn't embraced
as warmly by critics or viewers, the film was a step forward in terms of
Tarantino's visual style and, more importantly, it allowed the
writer/director to tell a different story with different characters.
Conversely, Guy Ritchie has quickly followed up his hit Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels with a film that shows very little growth.  Snatch
is simply more of the same, and could even be considered a companion
film to Lock, Stock.  It offers nothing new, but that's not necessarily
a bad thing.  You don't hear people complaining that George Lucas is
still making films about Jedi Masters and The Force, do you?
Snatch offers two different stories for your viewing pleasure.  One
features two amateur boxing promoters  Turkish (Jason Statham from
Lock, Stock) and Tony (Stephen Graham)  who inadvertently get wrapped
up in a fight-fixing scheme with a crooked Don King type aptly named
Brick Top (Lock, Stock's Alan Ford).  When Turkish and Tony's fighter,
Gorgeous George, is put out of commission just days before Brick Top's
fixed fight, the two protagonists have to lure a greasy, unintelligible,
bare-knuckled Gypsy legend (deftly played by Brad Pitt, Fight Club) to
stand in for their injured man.
In the meantime, an 84-karat diamond has been stolen from Antwerp by a
gambling addict named Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro, Traffic).
As the giant stone makes its way to London, groups of various thugs wait
to take it off Franky's hands (or take off Franky's hand, since the
diamond is in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist).  There's the
seemingly indestructible Russian gangster Boris The Blade (Rade
Sherbedgia, Space Cowboys), the American crook Avi (Dennis Farina,
Reindeer Games) and a plethora of other zany characters that pass the
rock around like a hot potato.
The two stories converge at various times throughout the film, and all
of it is completely unbelievable, but entertaining nonetheless.  Ritchie
ups the formula he used in Lock, Stock by making Snatch's story a bit
more complicated, using more characters with wackier names played by
bigger acting talent.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as funny or
well-structured as his previous film.  Instead, Snatch is like a typical
American blockbuster, where the plot takes a backseat to a collection of
cartoonish supporting characters and over-the-top action sequences. Some
of the unnecessary violence was reminiscent of the mean-spirited dud
Payback, but the boxing scenes were done very well.
On the plus side, Ritchie's gritty, stylish direction is just as slick
here as it was in Lock, Stock.  Whether you're talking about the
impressive title cards that introduce each character at the beginning of
the film, or the Run Lola Run-ish montage used to show Franky's gambling
addiction, or the accelerated/decelerated/repeated clips of key events,
Ritchie is clearly on top of his game.  The film is full of clever
editing (some of it is very much like Requiem For a Dream), dazzling
camera work and great music (plus a Madonna song, to boot).

   British writer/director Guy Ritchie repeats the hip "Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" formula with this new, ultra-violent
crime caper - and it's less effective the second time 'round. This is
all about a diamond heist gone sour, bare knuckle boxing and a dog who
swallows a squeak toy. Benicio Del Toro ("Traffic") is Franky Four
Fingers, a diamond thief and gambler, who is passing through London en
route to New York to deliver a glittering 86-carat gem that he stole
in Antwerp to his Anglophobe boss, Dennis Farina. While distributing
some smaller sparklers to his boss's mobster cousin and other Hatton
Garden jewelers, he places a bet on an illegal boxing match. What he
doesn't know is that he's been set up for robbery - and worse. So much
for the gruesome, convoluted plot.  The gritty, working-class
characters are sadistic gangster caricatures and not at all likable,
in contrast to the four lads in "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
Brad Pitt is almost unintelligible as One Punch Mickey, an Irish gypsy
boxer; he's brawny and buff but he seems to be babbling
incoherently. As for Guy Ritchie's Tarantino-like craftsmanship in
directing, it's simply "been there, done that" as the colorful, if
over-aggressive, bumblers energetically bungle their way from mishap
to mayhem. And what's with the supposedly symbolic scenes of cruelty
to animals? Surely Ritchie's torrid courtship of Madonna and Child
cannot have robbed him of all originality. However, one must credit
him for a disgustingly unique explanation of the phrase, "as greedy as
a pig." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Snatch" is a
confusing, shamelessly repetitive 4. Its continuous action and
frenetic pace don't make it either fresh or funny. I'm curious to see
what genre Ritchie tackles next.

  I've heard said that young people don't give much of a fig
for stories anymore. What they want to see on the screen is
special effects along with their explosions and car crashes--
which accounts for box office takes  for "The Cell," "Vertical
Limit," and "Proof of Life."  If they can't get special effects or
explosions, then give the principal target audience lots of
visuals, actions galore to keep their minds distracted from the
fact that the movie has no plot worth thinking about. 
"Snatch," written and directed by Guy Ritchie--who gave us
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" but does not
consider this a sequel--is mayhem posing as hip; motion
aspiring to chic.  While this bit of convuluted,
disconnected mayhem may simply be the sort of thing I just
don't "get," I suspect that "Snatch" is the picture that will be
praised by people who are eager to patronize the lovers of
story lines--the folks they consider plain too old-fashioned to
go for postmodern gibberish.
   While we may be tempted to think that the title is a double
entendre, "Snatch" seems to refer exclusively to the aim of
some London and NY underworld characters to seize an 83-
carat diamond, but this is no "Topkapi" by a long shot.  The
diamond caper takes a backseat to some almost
incomprehensible activities executed by a cast doing
uninteresting things with the one exception of a pit bull which
is instrumental to the yarn--and that dog doesn't even get a
credit.  
   The commotion begins when a quartet of diamond bandits
disguised as Hasidim including Franky Four Fingers (Benicio
Del Toro) rip off a wholesale jeweler to deliver the 83 carat
diamond to Franky's employer, Avi (Dennis Farina).  Franky,
a compulsive gambler, bets with the Russian Boris The Blade
(Rade Serbedjija) on an illegal boxing bout, unaware that he
is being set up for a robbery at the hands of Vinny (Robbie
Gee), Sol (Lennie James), and Tyrone (Ade).  (Ade, the
getaway driver, is so fat that he can barely get out of the
getaway car...that's the level of humor you'll find in various
parts of the movie.)  Turkish (Jason Statham) hooks up with
top criminal and pig farm owner (the pigs are used to eat
bodies, thereby disposing of evidence) Brick Top (Alan Ford)
to fix a fight, but Mikey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy who
speaks an almost impenetrable language, refuses to take a
fall and knocks out all opponents.
   The one catchy visual in this picture can be missed if you
blink and will remind cineastes of a similar run-through of
sorts in "Requiem for a Dream."  Avi, the only attractive and
interesting human being in the movie, catches a Concorde to
London: Ritchie shows the entire booking, the flight and the
movement through British passport control in four seconds.
  Though the violence is largely an illusion, instances of solid
editing by Jon Harris, the suggestion is as brutal as that
found in "Fight Club," including the mostly off-screen poking
of a caged pit bull and the sending of a couple of killer dogs
after a frightened rabbit for sport.  The film is about a
succession of double crosses, indicating that there really is
no honesty among thieves and rascals, but to get back to my
theory, I think the film will be used by the chic set to look
down on fuddy-duddies who prefer movies to have a point.

 Fingers), Dennis Farina (Avi), Jason Flemyng (Darren),Vinnie Jones

 the Blade), Jason Statham (Turkish), Stephen Graham (Tommy), Alan Ford
 (Brick Top), Ade (Tyrone), Lennie James (Sol), Robbie Gee (Vinny),
 Adam Fogerty (Gorgeous George), Mike Reid (Doug the Head), Sorcha
 Cusack (Mrs. O'Neil-Mickey's mother), Andy Beckwith (Errol); Runtime:
 105; Screen Gems; 2000-UK/USA)
Guy Ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to
his surprise box-office cult hit "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"
but has made the same kind of empty, semiserious/comedy/crime caper,
with many of the same actors from that film. But, this time the story
holds together better and is much more amusing, thanks in a large part
to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity.
It's a film filled with an assortment of colorful Runyonesque characters
from the underworld of crime, or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches, or
from the outcasts of society. They are shady Jews speaking in broken
Yiddish, who are diamond thieves; black con artists running petty scams;
members of a gypsy caravan who engage in various hustles; and Brits with
heavy cockney accents who are either thugs or wannabe thugs. Everyone is
after some easy money. This film, like the director's other one, has no
strong role for a woman.
The main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that
somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or
are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance, but the plot is really
irrelevant, it plays as a McGuffin--this is strictly a character driven
film, with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way,
undeveloped, or forgettable.
Thieves posing as Hasidics, heist a valuable, flawless 84-carat stone
diamond from an Antwerp jeweler and split-up after the job, leaving the
diamond with the exquisitely well-tailored Jewish gangster Franky Four
Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). He places the diamond in a briefcase
handcuffed to his wrist and calls his diamond dealer relative Avi
(Farina) in New York, telling him he has landed in London and has spoken
to Doug the Head (Reid), who is a wannabe Jew and a fence for jewels.
The double-cross begins when one of the thieves, before they split,
tells Franky to see the Russian, Boris the Blade (Sherbedgia), while in
London, and he will get him a gun. The thief then calls his relative
Boris and tells him to rob the diamond from Franky.
Boris gives the gun for free to Franky, but asks a favor of him, to
place a bet with a bookie on a boxing match. He then arranges for black
pawnshop owner Sol (Lennie James) to rob the bookie and get the
briefcase to him. Sol brings along for the job two inept partners, Vinny
(Robbie Gee) and Tyrone (Ade).
The movie will spin-off in different directions, telling each groups'
story, until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself
out. The film is narrated by the main protagonist, the somewhat likable
Turkish (Jason Statham), who with his clueless pal Tommy (Stephen
Graham) own an amusement arcade and are boxing promoters, and are not
above being small-time crooks.
Turkish wants a newer caravan instead of the wreck he currently has to
be his business office and sends Tommy to buy one, but Tommy gets his
fighter beat up in the gypsy camp he went to buy the caravan. To replace
their fighter for an upcoming fight, Tommy gets the one who put his
boxer out of commmission, the hustler who sold them the broken-down
caravan, Mickey (Pitt), an Irish gypsy with an indeciferable brogue, a
body filled with tattoos, and a beautiful knock-out punch. He is told to
take a dive in a bare-knuckles boxing match arranged by Brick Top (Alan
Ford), a notorious gang leader. If he doesn't take the dive, they're all
in trouble with the sadistic Brick Top.
Avi, when he finds out from Doug that Franky is going to a boxing match
and can't be located, flies over to London and hires Bullet Tooth Tony
(former soccer star Vinnie Jones) to find Franky. Since Franky is a
compulsive gambler and earned his nickname because he lost a finger over
his bad luck in gambling, Avi fears he will lose the diamond to bookies.
The film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it
thinks is crazy into the comic mix, even a shaggy dog story. The
language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand
because of the heavy accents. The violence is brutal but cartoonish, as
the film is styled much like a comic book. Guy Ritchie's wife Madonna
sings "Lucky Star." The rest of this heavily induced homage to musical
video films, has a soundtrack that ranges from Massive Attack to Oasis.
Ford's menacing psychotic performance, stood out as the film's most
memorable one. Pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance I best
enjoyed, as it gave the film a sparkling light touch; while, Dennis
Farina, also, was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to
this cartoonish film.
The only slow down in the film is in the opening moments, when the large
cast of characters is introduced. Other than that, the film moves at
high speed, with all kinds of film gimmicks, from jump cuts to multi use
of graphics. This is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its
signature theme. I would call it another dumb cult picture the director
has made, one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care
about.

A rollicking exercise in perverse darkness, Guy Ritchie's sophomore
outing, "Snatch," is the rare film that produces disgust-induced humor
with some degree of frequency and yet never stoops to a juvenile
level. The laughs in this crime-dominated movie find their origin in a
hearty combination of relatively innocent matters like gambling
addictions, thick accents and trans-Atlantic travel as well as less
innocent yet equally amusing situations presented including unlicensed
boxing matches where the fix is in, a murderer who uses pigs to
dispose of his bodies and a band of less-than-honest gypsies.
Sorting out the plot of "Snatch" is a slightly more strenuous task,
however.  An oddly unique combination of "Goodfellas," "Entrapment"
and, in a more limited respect, "Diamonds," the movie follows a crime
ring, diamond heist and boxing scam that all intersect early and
often. It all starts when Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro, who
follows up his much-noted role in "Traffic" with another solid
performance) gets laid over in London on his way back to the States
where he is to deliver a huge diamond to his boss, Avi (Dennis
Farina). Meanwhile, he has some smaller diamonds he decides to unload
while "in town." In the process, his gambling addiction takes a toll
and he gives into temptation when asked to place a bet on one of the
aforementioned unlicensed bare-knuckle bouts that would give even Don
King the willies. The wager is, of course, a set up and soon enough
Franky Four Fingers has a problem on his hands. Enter Mickey O'Neil
(Brad Pitt, who gives one of his better and more enjoyable
performances in his return to a fighting role after the hugely-popular
"Fight Club"), an Irish gypsy with extraordinary charisma and a heavy,
incomprehensible accent that is worsened for the viewer by his fluency
in Cockney Rhyming Slang. After knocking out the boxer who was set to
go down in the match, Mickey must fill in for him. Problem is that
Mickey doesn't take orders too well.
There are more characters and additional plot lines, but
writer/director Ritchie seems thoroughly uninterested in their
clarity. And that is perhaps a wise move as an understanding of the
basic outline and an appreciation for the sinful and oftentimes-morbid
humor is enough to enjoy this fine piece of art. And to fill whatever
voids may remain, a phenomenal ensemble effort and some very creative
camerawork are at Ritchie's disposal.
Pitt steals the show with his hearty accent, scraggly facial hair and
obviously phony enthusiasm about the "mess" he gets himself into.
Unfortunately for Pitt, the film is being released three weeks after
the cutoff for consideration in 2000, a year full of generally weak
supporting performances where his might be considered among the
finest. But it is still far too early to speculate how he may stack up
against the class of 2001.  Benicio Del Toro also comes across strong
in yet another gangster performance, following earlier successes in
"The Usual Suspects," "The Way of the Gun" and, most recently,
"Traffic." The rest of the cast is delightful to watch in their oddly
creepy roles, including Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony and Alan
Ford as Brick Top.
Ritchie, along with director of photography Tim Maurice-Jones and
editor Jon Harris, creates a strangely unique visual effect in many
parts of the film.  Whether it be snappy editing with isolated colors
in the film's opening montage or just generally deft coverage of the
movie's bouts, the trio recognize the possibility of visuals even in a
film made to look grungy and realize that possibility fully here.
Be warned that "Snatch" can be quite offensive at times. The film's
most subtle yet humorous line is a character's inquisitive "In the
quiet words of the Virgin Mary, please come again.'" There are Irish
jokes scattered throughout. It takes less than five minutes for a
Jewish joke to pop up. The film even takes a potshot at the British
from time to time. But even if 2001 is truly the beginning of the
"politically correct millennium, "Snatch" is the finest film to be
released thus far and well worth a look by most adult audiences.

What do a gambler named Franky Four Fingers (Benincio Del Toro), a hit-man 
named Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), and a gypsy caravan dealer named 
Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) have in common? It's almost too complicated to 
explain, but I'll do my best. Franky Four Fingers has just been given an 84 
karat diamond to take back to the US and put in the hands of a jewel dealer 
named Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina). Unfortunately, the apparently incincible 
Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) wants the diamond before it leaves the UK 
and sends a few down on their luck jewelers (Robbie Gee, Lennie James, Ade) 
to get it for him. They sort of succeed, and Cousin Avi is forced to go to 
London to get it for himself. He hires Bullet Tooth to track down Boris 
before the mad Russian can get it out of the country. Meanwhile, two boxing 
promoters named Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) have a 
problem of their own. They promised the local big shot gangster, Brick Top 
(Alan Ford) that their man would go down in the fourth round of the latest 
match. Unfortunately, their man just got his clock cleaned by Mickey O'Neil 
that he won't be able to fight at all. So, they hire Mickey to take the fall 
instead. The only problem with that plan is that Mickey appears to have 
trouble following instructions. He seems to believe that "Go down in the 
fourth" actually means "Knock the other guy out with one hit." All these 
characters and more will meet up, cross paths, and make each others' lives 
quite interesting over the course of one week.
I know it's almost a crime to say this, but I wasn't a big fan of Guy 
Ritchie's first effort, 1998's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. 
I wasn't overly entertained by it, I found the kinetic, hyper-active style 
irritating, and it struck me as not half as cool as it thought it was. I 
guess this style of filmmaking grows on a person, because while 
Snatch contains many of the same filming elements, I enjoyed it quite 
a bit more. I'm not saying I walked out of the theater wondering at what a 
marvelous film I'd just witnessed, but I can certainly say that I didn't 
regret spending six bucks to see it. It's the sort of fast paced, vulgar, 
violent movie most American audiences will probably eat up. Now, if you've 
read my reviews before you're probably wondering why I liked it if most 
American audiences did. Well, I enjoyed it for two reasons: One, the actors 
are all clearly having a great time, and that always carries over to the 
audience; and two, it's the kind of pitch black comedy that always keeps me 
cackling like some sick, demented weirdo. Which brings up another point; if 
you don't like your comedies to contain horrifying comedy similar to that 
in, say, Fight Club, give this movie a wide berth.
A great man pointed out to me that Brad Pitt is at his best when playing a 
goofy character, and at his worst when forced to try an accent. It's as 
though Pitt himself were listening in on us when we had this conversation, 
because he's decided to combine the two. Of course, I use the word "accent" 
in its loosest sense since nearly everything Pitt says in the film is 
completely unintelligible. Amazingly enough, he manages to be very 
entertaining despite having only one or two lines the audience can 
understand. Obviously I'm not going to cover every actor in a movie with a 
cast this size, so I'll just cover a few of the high points. Vinnie Jones 
(Gone in 60 Seconds) is ideal as the suave, smarter than he looks, 
Bullet Tooth Tony; and the way he plays a scene where he's confronted by two 
guys with fake guns is simply priceless. Alan Ford (Lock, Stock, and Two 
Smoking Barrels) is quite good as the menacing Brick Top; Dennis Farina 
(wasted in Reindeer Games) is a riot as the uptight Cousin Avi; and 
Jason Statham (Lock, Stock) nicely underplays the role of Turkish. 
You're probably why I haven't mentioned Benicio Del Toro, who was 
galvanizing in Traffic. Well, it's because despite his being 
prominently mentioned both in the previews and in my plot summary, his role 
amounts to little more than a cameo. Bad call Mr. Ritchie.
I knew from the start, when that shopping list of characters was introduced 
in the space of about three minutes, that this ride was going to be either 
very confusing and quite funny, or just plain confusing. As the story began, 
and plot lines flew freely about the screen while laughs were scarce, I 
began to fear the latter possibility was manifesting itself. Thankfully, 
after a rocky twenty minutes or so, the film finds its groove and the comedy 
begins. Also, despite what looks to be a confusing story and some of the 
most hyperactive direction you're likely to find, Snatch is 
remarkably easy to follow. All the plot lines intersect (or perhaps I should 
say run head-first into one another), all the characters are fleshed out, 
and we're given a few nice little twists. It's by no means an outstanding 
movie, and it will probably leave your mind shortly after exiting the 
theater (I know it left mine about that quick, and it's a good thing I 
remembered to take notes this time around), but it doesn't aspire to be 
ground breaking. This movie is present for one reason alone: to entertain; 
and, unlike so many movies which came out of the year 2000, this one 
actually succeeds due to its quirky and amusing characters, its inability to 
take itself seriously, and its frantic pacing which never lets you catch 
your breath.
Sadly, there are still a few elements working against Snatch in 
addition to the opening act. Like Lock, Stock before it, 
Snatch simply isn't quite as cool as it thinks it is. Throughout the 
film I was struck by the fact that Ritchie had only some vague idea what a 
cool movie was, so he tried every approach possible in an attempt to create 
such a movie. He hits a few times, primarily in the scenes which smack of 
Quentin Tarantino, but otherwise he just can't quite seem to get it right. 
Strangely enough, while this same problem really bothered me in Lock, 
Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, it didn't much grate on my nerves this 
time around. I was just too caught up in laughing at the constant stream of 
bizarre and eccentric characters to care much that Ritchie didn't have a 
clue how to make a movie as cool as, say, Pulp Fiction, which he 
obviously idolizes. I feel I should mention the film's soundtrack, which 
doesn't contain a single song I'd normally enjoy, but also not a single one 
that doesn't fit the tone of the movie. Snatch runs a little too long 
at 104 minutes. I'd recommend the film to fans of Ritchie's previous effort, 
to fans of Brad Pitt since he gives a very amusing performance, and to 
people who love movies which simply refuse to let up in the action. I give 
Snatch four out of five stars.
