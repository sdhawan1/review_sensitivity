   The Spanish artist Francisco de Goya once said that
without imagination, we are no better than the animals.  He
put his brushes where his mouth is: his lithographs and
canvases are so fanciful and innovative that he has been
called by some the first modern painter.  Few directors could
have done a better job in creating an imaginative biopic about
the great man than Carlos Saura, who has regularly shunned
the boredom of realism in his thirty films--which have included
such dramatic works as the violent "Bodas de sangre," and
the musically rich "El amor brujo," "Flamenco" and "Tango."
   The film opens on a plump, rapidly aging Goya at age 82
where, racked by blinding headaches and afflicted with
deafness from a disease he contracted while in his forties, he
hallucinates about his life.  Shifting from the painter's present
in the year 1828, Saura's photographer Vittorio Storaro takes
us on a journey that shows Goya as a middle aged man,
shifting regularly from the artist's portrayal as a younger man
by Jose Coronado to a rendition marked by a strong
performance from Francisco Rabal.  As Storaro emulates the
artist's own palette of colors, transforming the film into what
could be best be called paintings in motion, Goya is morphed
from the exterior of a butchered piece of meat that is strung
up on a wall into the ghostly face of a man who is shortly to
face death.  Transfixed on the favorite of his many loves, the
vibrant, whimsical and arrogant Duchess of Alba whom he
calls by her first name Cayetana (Maribel Verdu), Goya
follows this apparition while still in his nightshirt,
somnambulistically traversing a street where he is almost
knocked down by a horse and carriage and gets into an
argument with a fellow into whose companion he has
bumped.  Dependent on his young, impressionable but
quickly maturing daughter Rosario (Dafne Fernandez), Goya
is now cohabiting with his latest and last lover, Loecadia
(Eulalia Ramon)--whose aversion to the man's luridly
sorrowful works fortunately has failed to anchor the artist's
work in an insipid reality.
   As Goya fantasizes furiously about his better days, the time
that he produced a wealth of striking oils and also a number
of lithographs produced on a cumbersome machine, Saura
introduces his audience--an ethereal niche, I'd imagine,
because the slow pace and dreamlike ambiance would
challenge the typical moviegoer--to a series of scenes both
impersonally cruel and pictorially lovely.  The one scene that
even some teen horror fans might sponge up is a re-
enactment of a painting that Goya once created of a mythical
story of St. Anthony of Padua in which Anthony questions a
buried corpse, which rises from his box to clear an innocent
man of his murder while putting finger on the guilty party--
who is promptly executed by the saint.  The most theatrical
scene involves a performance by a theatre group, La Fura
dels Baus, which dramatizes the painter's "Disasters of War,"
an almost mechanical procession of Napoleon's soldiers firing
on Spanish prisoners who are tied to stakes.  
   "Goya in Bordeaux" would probably attract the sort of
audience that enjoyed the recent Canadian entry, "The Red
Violin," but while the latter picture is rich in glorious music
and an expansive landscape of people who at different times
possessed the instrument of the title, "Goya" is theatrical,
contained, and in fact cannot hide the fact that almost the
entire work has been filmed in studios.  The lighting is
perhaps its most striking attribute.  We see faces come into
focus lit presumably by the illumination of a plethora of
candles.  The death scene is also particularly arresting, a
shadow moving slowly over the nightshirt-clad body of a man
whose mind has been leaving him.  On the whole, the
picture, like the doddering artist himself, is generally lacking
in vitality and might be better served on the stage than on the
big screen. Nonetheless, "Goya in Bordeaux" is a welcome
work that sheds light on the artist, though Saura's screenplay
often focuses too heavily on his obsession with his greatest
love, Cayetana.

Famed Spanish painter Francisco Goya created paintings of carcasses of pigs, 
sheep and other animals using dark, vibrant colors (he also painted visions 
of death using people as well). His life must have been fascinating but you 
wouldn't know it from watching Carlos Saura's "Goya in Bordeaux," which 
reveals so little of the man and his art that it may as well be about good 
old King Henry VIII, if not for the time period and costuming. 
The old Goya is played by Francisco Rabal, shown living in exile in France 
with his caring wife and his mature teenage daughter, Rosario (Daphne 
Fernandez). Goya reminisces about his past to Rosario, though she has heard 
these stories countless times before. He speaks of an affair he had with the 
dangerous Cayetano, Duchess of Alba (Maribel Verdu), who later opposed and 
was thus poisoned by the Queen Maria Luisa. There are also glimpses into his 
days as a court painter, his portraits of people he found both significant 
and otherwise, his increasing deafness, his admiration of Velazquez's "Las 
Meninas" and the visions of death he had that so haunted him till the end of 
his life. The younger, middle-aged Goya as shown in these flashbacks is 
played by Jose Coronado, and he is so charismatic and romantic that one 
wishes Saura spent more time exploring this actor. Alas, he does not. 
"Goya in Bordeaux" is stunningly shot by one of our great cinematographers, 
Vittorio Storaro (who helmed Saura's previous "Tango," as well as some early 
Bertolucci), and it is beautifully crafted with various lighting color 
schemes and silhouettes, as if we were watching a painting unfold before our 
eyes. Unfortunately, there is barely much illumination into Goya's life and 
so we get the feeling that we are watching a series of still lifes that shed 
scarce insight into the man. We mostly see the older Goya fretting and 
arguing and feeling disoriented by his paintings but that is as far as one 
gets into his soul. As it is, this film may as well be about any sick old man 
living in exile.

 GOYA IN BORDEAUX (GOYA EN BURDEOS) (director/writer: Carlos Saura;
 cinematographer: Vittorio Storaro; editor: Julia Juaniz; cast:
 Francisco Rabal (Goya), Jose Coronado (Goya as a Young Man), Maribel
 Verdú (Duchess of Alba ), Dafne Fernández (Rosario), Eulalia Ramón
 (Leocadia), Joaquín Climent (Moratin), José María Pou (Godoy);
 Runtime: 105; Sony Pictures Classics; 1999-Spain)
A visually pleasing but unmoving homage biopic of the 18th-century
Spanish painter Francisco Goya. The director, Carlos Saura, has had
trouble with the storytelling part of his films in the past, as his
great craftsmanship skills seem to far exceed his other abilities as a
filmmaker.
The film opens in a surreal manner as a cow's carcass seems to be
dragging itself over a dirt red field to a scaffold and then raises
itself up as its flesh opens and its insides are exposed. It was Goya's
belief that man without imagination is only an animal, and this is the
first lesson we are taught in this pedantic film study of him. From the
cow's insides, the appearance of a dying 82-year-old Goya (Rabal)
emerges, startled that he's lying in bed, living in exile in Bordeaux,
France's wine region.
He goes out in the street in his nightshirt, and is thought of as a
crazy foreigner by the passers-by, as he calls out for his dead former
lover Cayetana (Maribel Verdú), seeing her ghost in the street. She is
the hot-blooded beauty he loved the most of all his many women. He is
soon watched over by his lovely young daughter Rosario (Dafne Fernández)
and brought back to bed, where he's forced to drink a cup of valerian.
The artist is dazed but anxious to tell someone of his past and chooses
to tell it to his daughter, as we will learn of his life from these
flashbacks, and he will also reveal his nightmares, the gossip of the
times, the politics, the history, his romances, and his intellectual
opinions.
The flashback will begin by taking us to Osuna's salon, where the best
minds and aristocracy of Madrid met. Goya (José Coronado) is in his
mid-40's, a womanizer, fortunate through his connections to be the court
painter in Charles IV's court, which is ruled by ignorance, corruption,
and calumny. This gig enables him to get more commissions than he could
handle and to live in luxury. He is seen talking to his treacherous
friend Godoy (José María Pou), admiring the pretty woman he wants to
meet, the Dutchess of Alba, Cayetana. We learn about the romance between
her and him, as a dialogue ensues between the ailing octogenarian and
himself at this more youthful age. It was at that time that Goya nearly
died from an unexplained illness that left him permanently deaf. His
recovery from that illness resulted in an artistic breakthrough, whereby
his subject matter became more realistic, resulting in his gruesome
series of engravings "The Disasters of War."
In the film's most telling moments, he tells his daughter the truth
about why he fled Spain. It has to do with the charismatic Dutchess,
whose radiant beauty and excitable temperament led to dangerous actions
on her part. She was part of a plot to assassinate the Spanish queen,
Maria Luisa. But the jealous queen of the Inquisition instead had her
poisoned to death with the help of the ambitious and scheming royal
secretary Godoy, who was the lover of both women. The liberal Goya
wisely saw the handwriting on the wall and fled his oppressive country,
looking for comfort from the French intellectuals of the enlightenment
but was in the end disappointed by France's government, whose designs on
Spain were mercenary and of self-interest.
In the final death scene, the artist calls out not for his current lady
companion Leocadia but for Cayetana, as he succumbs and her dark shadow
emerges from a painting he did of her and covers him in death.
The film never touched base with the painter and his great works of art.
It seemed like a dry lecture, with the artist's paintings laboriously
put on display, making for some gorgeous framed shots, but not offering
a film that is emotionally touching. What we learn is that Goya was a
flawed man, feeling himself to be cowardly and weak-spirited at times,
whose great influences to overcome his shortcomings were, Velázquez,
Rembrandt, and his imagination tied to reason. But the film itself does
not let on why we should assume Goya was a great painter, it seems to
have failed the artist in that sense. The film ends with the quote from
Andre Malraux: After Goya, modern painting begins. I was left with the
impression that if this film would continue in its pedantic way of
telling the story, it is possible in part 2 that we would know why that
was so.

I'll admit, I have fit all my knowledge of Spanish painter Francisco
Goya into the sentence you're reading right now.  What's a Spanish
painter doing in Bordeaux, France?  I don't know, and after watching
this film, I still don't know.  I had to read a synopsis on the movie's
web site to find out he had been exiled there.  I'm still not sure why.
To be certain, Goya in Bordeaux assumes the audience is deeply intimate
with his Goya's work, his life, and his politics.  It's a love letter
written to the man by writer/director Carlos Saura, who clearly
idealizes everything about the artist.  Unless you are like Saura, this
will undoubtedly be seen as a not good thing.
The story, as it is, gives us an ancient and fat Goya (Francisco Rabal),
in aforementioned exile, recounting his life to the impossibly young
daughter of who-knows-how-many love affairs.  A great lover in his
younger days (played by José Coronado) during the late 1700's -- and
aren't all Spanish men in film great lovers? -- he hung with the
powdered wig set as his dark paintings brought the ire of Spanish
"absolutists."  Going deaf at the age of 46, Goya soon turned into a
bitter man, his work taking on ever more morose and disturbing themes,
eventually driving him to near insanity.  And France.
Goya's work is generously on display in the film, unlike most entries
into the genre which do not get permission to show the works and end up
having to fake it (see garbage like Surviving Picasso and Love is the
Devil for examples of how bad this is).  Through his deathbed
hallucinations, we even get to see Goya's most famous works reenacted
and come to life -- with zombies coming out of the walls to attack our
slumbering hero.  These sequences reminded me of everything from 2001 to
Vertigo, and Saura's lighting trickery and flair with the scenes rescue
Goya from entering a canon of truly atrocious painter-biopics.
Too bad the rest of the movie is nowhere near as successful.  Coronado
is a dashing leading man, but his portrayal of Goya is so perplexing due
to its lack of exposition, one wonders if he is being true to his
character or even his surroundings.  The political context of Spain in
1780 isn't something many moviegoers or I are going to have at the top
of their minds, and the film does nothing to help you through it.
Then again, this is a Spanish film about a Spanish national treasure.  I
don't remember Mel Gibson going out of his way to explain the
revolutionary background of The Patriot, either.

GOYA IN BORDEAUX (Goya en Burdeos) (Spain, 1999) *** 1/4. Written & 
directed by Carlos Saura. Photography, Vittorio Storaro. Art 
director, Pierre-Louis Thevent. Editing, Julia Juaniz. Music, Roque 
Banos. Cast: Francesco Rabal (old Goya),  Jose Coronado (younger 
Goya),  Dafne Fernandez (Rosario), Maribel Verdu (Duchess of Alba), 
Eulalia Ramon (Leocadia), Joe Mai Pou (Godoy), et al. Sony Pic. 
Classic release. Spanish with subtitles. Ca. 100 minutes. R (violent 
scenes) A the Art.
Since the film has been around for several weeks it has been widely 
reviewed.  Some opinions are tepid, some  positive, others ecstatic. 
Much depends on what a viewer knows about the great Spanish painter 
(1746-1828), art, aSpanish history, Napoleonic Wars, etc.  Much also 
depends on what the spectator expects from a film about a major 
artist to be.
It is decidedly not a documentary, an "educational" movie, a 
traditional biography, or anything familiar in movies. The closest to 
a categorization is : a fractured Goyaesque view of periods, 
elements, the personality and the talent of Goya, qua artist and qua 
human being.
It is civilized cinema. Its most obvious main attribute is the superb 
cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, the Italian master who has won a 
record four Oscars : The Last Emperor, One From the Heart, Reds, 
Apocalypse Now,
Goya is introduced as an exile in Bordeaux (France) at age 82. (This 
un-didactic and un-academic film may give  the impression that he had 
been sent into exile, but this was a voluntarily exile of many 
Spanish Liberals who detested the royal regime). In France, the 
widowed Goya lives with his latest mistress Leocadia who is his 
junior by 40 years, and his youngest daughter Rosario who is a 
lovely, loving child, smart and wise beyond her years.
Old Goya is played by Francisco Rabal who was then about 74.  Rabal 
has been in about 185 movies,  Spanish, international ( French, 
Mexican, Italian, American, etc.) Many were directed by such masters 
as Torre-Nilsson, Bunuel, Saura,  Bardem,Visconti, Antonioni, Tanner 
and others.  For those who remember the younger Rabal, he is 
unrecognizable here.  The old man Old Goya is a human wreck, a 
debilitated monster, cranky, crotchety, tormented by the past and 
present, and a lip reader since losing his hearing at age 45. His 
"story" is told without crystal-clear chronology, mostly to his 
daughter or as visions, with  zig-zags of time. The flashbacks and 
flashforwards lead to a multiplicity of periods, as well as the 
joining of past and present in several scenes. (One must suspend 
disbelief in the many sections where Goya read lips so well that 
reality becomes mythical.)
The "young" Goya is well performed by 42-year old Jose Coronado who 
notwithstandings some 20 films is unknown outside Spain. A small 
puzzle: while Coronado plays his Goya at different ages, he looks 
essentially the same. But then, the movie is such a work a fantasy 
that literal realism is no big problem.
There is no way to tell the "story" without using up column inches or 
confusing the reader. The movie is self-explanatory, the art of the 
superb director Carlos Saura is apparent, his collaboration with 
Storaro seamless.
The film is a cauldron with a paella of thoughts, talk and visuals 
about art, with interspersed sketches, drawings, engravings, still 
paintings, paintings that move and take on life, homages to Velasquez 
(both by the film and by Goya),    "tableaux vivants," politics, and 
the long affair between Goya and the love of his life. She is always 
in his  heart and mind.  The Duchess of Alba was a great beauty, a 
great wit, a powerful political figure, the richest woman in Spain 
and at some point the hated enemy of the King and Queen. The latter 
and her lover Godoy poisoned her, says Goya.  The Duchess was the 
model for  Goya's paintings "The Naked Maja" and "The Clothed Maja" 
which stand in amazing contrast to the revolutionary series "The 
Disasters of War."
Carlos Saura grew up as a passionate lover of films, music (his 
mother was a concert pianist), painting (his brother was a famous 
artist), dance, theater  and everything concerning art, politics, 
psychology or behavior. His record is sublime, from realistic to 
symbolic or allegorical political films (during the years of  that 
other Francisco, dictator Franco), to poetic works on love, dance and 
music (within dramas) which blend traditions and experimentation, and 
more. He made Goya at age 67. His passion for the subject and the 
film are obvious and striking. I can't help feeling that  they are 
colored by the Master's intimation of mortality.

Spain's prolific and visually audacious writer/director Carlos Saura 
(TANGO) is back this time with a film, GOYA IN BORDEAUX, about the 
famous painter Francisco de Goya, played by the even more prolific 
Spanish actor Francisco Rabal (TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN!).  The picture 
won several appropriately named "Goyas," the Spanish equivalent of the 
Oscars, for best actor, cinematography, set design and make-up.
Shot entirely on a sound stage, the surreal film opens with the image of 
a gutted beef carcass, being hauled up to dry.  As the camera pulls in 
tight on the bloody flesh, the editor dissolves the frame into one of 
Goya's face.  Looking like a not-quite-finished clay sculpture, Goya's 
large pock-marked face slowly comes to life.
The movie itself is told in flashbacks as the ailing octogenarian tells 
stories to his young teenaged daughter, Rosario (Daphne Fernández).  
Although he has clearly told his stories to her many times before, she 
smiles and assures him that she has never heard them before.
Listening to these ramblings of an old man is rather like trying to 
assemble a puzzle in which you've lost most of the pieces.  We do learn 
that he once strived with all of his might to become a court painter.  
Later, it seems, he became more revolutionary and renounced his prior 
allegiances.  Much more than that isn't clear.  He did have a love 
affair with one of his nude models, a fetchingly beautiful Duchess of 
Alba (Maribel Verdú).  José Coronado plays Goya as a young man, and 
sometimes both ages appear in the same scene to discuss his art and his 
life.
To evaluate GOYA IN BORDEAUX on the storyline and dialog, however, 
misses the point of the film.  Saura is a visual stylist and his works 
have to be evaluated on that level.  Think of this as a cinematic opera, 
and you'll get the idea.  For this reason, whenever Roque Bańos's 
wonderful period music plays and the actors shut up, the movie soars.  
The corollary to this, however, is that when the film, as it frequently 
does, sticks to traditional dialog sans music, it quickly grinds to a 
halt.  But pump up the sound, turn on the fog machine and let those 
actors stroll by in lavish costumes, powdery wigs and make-up, and you 
have grand opera for just the price of a movie ticket.
GOYA IN BORDEAUX runs 1:42.  The film is in Spanish with English 
subtitles.  It is rated R for some sexuality and violent imagery and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.

If you believe what you see in the movies, everyone who has ever picked
up a paintbrush is completely whacked out of their mind.  Henry Thomas'
character in Fever should have been locked up forever, and let's not
even talk about the messed-up Mafia art in Mickey Blue Eyes.  Films
based on real-life talents like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Jackson Pollock
aren't much different, showing artists as suffering, angst-ridden kooks
with a gift that ultimately consumes them.
Carlos Saura's Goya in Bordeaux is more of the same.  Spanish painter
Francisco de Goya, considered by many to be the greatest artist of the
modern era, is portrayed as an unhinged madman with a life full of
enough hallucinations to make Timothy Leary jealous.  One of the
continuing themes running through Goya's work was that humans are no
better than animals, a point driven home by the film's opening scene, in
which the bloody carcass of a bull dissolves into Goya's decrepit
82-year-old face.
Bordeaux shows two different Goyas  one young and vivacious (José
Coronado), and one old and out of his mind (Francisco Rabal).  The tales
of young Goya are shown in flashbacks as the older Goya bores his young
daughter (Daphne Fernández) with story after story of his glory days as
he rots away on his deathbed.
We see a young Goya hoping to one day become the court painter to
Spain's Charles IV but instead finding exile with other nationalists
after the liberal-stomping Ferdinand VII reclaimed his throne in 1814.
He fell in love with a beautiful Duchess (Maribel Verdú), and in his
40s, Goya went blind and found himself tormented by powerful headaches.
His work, which was always pretty dark, became even more disturbing.
The painter found himself haunted by both his troubling art and the
Duchess, who died because of her opposition to the Queen.
Bordeaux's story plays second fiddle to the film's amazing visuals,
which are as close as you can get to a Peter Greenaway film without
actually having Greenaway involved.  Armed with his extraordinary
cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro (Bulworth), Saura keeps the film
interesting with several unique cinematic devices, ranging from the use
of transparent wallpaper to having Goya's art coming to life before your
very eyes.  The film is highlighted by a recreation of Goya's series of
paintings called `Disasters of War,' which depicted Napoleon attacking
the Spanish.
It would have been one thing if Saura (Tango) made Bordeaux into a
plodding, two-plus-hour film, but it barely cracks the 90-minute mark 
just enough to hold my attention.  The film won several Goya Awards,
which are the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars.  Interestingly enough,
the American film Oscar did not win any Oscars.
1:39  R for some sexual content and violent imagery
