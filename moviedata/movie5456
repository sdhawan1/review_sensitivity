Any film based on a book, especially a well-known book, must invariably be
compared to that book.  In this case, the spectacular L. Ron Hubbard sci-fi
novel BATTLEFIELD EARTH is vastly superior to its film version in every
respect.  Having read the paperback twice and being more familiar with the
complexities of the story than the majority of the film's critics, I found
countless major discrepancies between the two, as will anyone else who has read
the book even once.  The screenwriter has taken very broad liberties with the
story and, in doing so, has created a script full of events which seen to occur
almost at random and often without discernible reason.
A great many of the film's elements with which critics have found fault are due
to the merciless hatchet job which was performed on the original story.  It
would take far too long to detail the many differences between the book and the
film, particularly in the finer details of the story, most of which were hacked
to bits or ignored completely.  To be fair, it is a rather lengthy tome - over
a thousand pages in paperback form - and any attempt to turn such a large novel
into a screenplay will undoubtedly require some amount of cutting and
rewriting, but the screenwriter seems to have edited the story with a chainsaw.
In fact, only the most basic plot remains: In the year 3000, Jonnie Goodboy
Tyler - one of Earth's last remaining humans after an invasion and takeover by
the alien Psychlo race a thousand years prior - leaves his secluded mountain
village, is captured by the evil Psychlo Terl [security chief of planet Earth],
is taught the Psychlo language and basic mining techniques courtesy of an
instruction machine [a device invented by an extinct alien race called
"Chinkos" in the book and, for some reason, "Clinkos" in the film] and, as a
secret experiment, is forced with other humans ["man-animals"] to mine a huge
gold deposit in the Rocky Mountains near the ruins of Denver.  Anxious to end
his tour of duty on the hideously ugly, weak-gravity, poisonous planet Earth,
Terl plans to teleport this cache of gold back to his home planet in coffins
normally used for shipping dead Psychlos, dig up the coffins after a time, and
retire an incredibly wealthy and powerful Psychlo. 
What the film only hints at, by way of several small unexplained flashes of
fire in the cockpit of Terl's personal transport plane, is that this gold
deposit is in an area full of uranium ore pockets, which means that no Psychlo
can get anywhere near it because radiation makes their "breathe-gas" explode. 
It also makes no mention of the point that this vast gold deposit had been
buried until recently, when an earthquake and resulting rock slide uncovered
it, allowing it to be discovered by Terl's reconnaissance drone.  Since it is
impossible for any Psychlo to mine the gold, Terl forces "man-animals" to do
the work for him after determining, in his initial experiments on our hero,
that humans can in fact be trained to perform certain tasks.  But, he
underestimates humans and refers to them as "rat brains" - what he doesn't know
is that Jonnie Tyler has learned what radiation does to Psychlo breathe-gas. 
Tyler procures a supply of old nuclear warheads from an ancient U.S. Air Force
base and substitutes them for Terl's gold in the lead coffins [marked
"Radiation-Killed" by Terl so that no Psychlo will want to open them]; they are
then teleported to planet Psychlo and detonated.
In the book, the Psychlos, in their infinite greed, have mined the crust of
their own planet [using their "deep-core mining technique"] to the point where
it resembles so much Swiss cheese, making it a bit fragile and easily
vulnerable to a nuclear blast - which, when Tyler's warheads are detonated,
punches a hole in the planet's crust reaching nearly to the core because the
teleportation receiving platform on Psychlo had been sealed off in every other
direction by an emergency force field, giving the full force of the blast
nowhere to go but down.  The film does show the result of this blast and of a
large amount of radiation being released into the breathe-gas atmosphere of
planet Psychlo, but it does so in such an anti-climactic way that you have to
wonder what just happened and why it happened in the first place.  There is no
clue that this is, in fact, one of the most crucial plot points in the original
story - the film basically depicts this event as "...and then planet Psychlo
exploded."  In the film, planet Psychlo is reduced to a cloud of dust; in the
book, it becomes what amounts to a small star, a point which is more than a
little bit important to the remainder of the story.
The very concept of teleportation, one of the most crucial elements of the
original story, is only a minor element of the film - I can only recall its
having been used twice, and even then only as a third-rate special effect.  It
is in fact the very key to the Psychlos' vast power; having an exclusive
monopoly on teleportation, the technology and mathematics of which they will
guard to the point of berzerker suicide, they control sixteen universes.  The
film doesn't even begin to hint at any of this, and in its absence, we learn
almost nothing about the Psychlo race itself - little more than that they come
from a purple planet and claim to have conquered Earth in nine minutes.
This, in broad summary, is the plot of the FIRST HALF of the original L. Ron
Hubbard novel - the second half presumably will be used as the basis of the
sequel, should anybody actually want to see one after this debacle. 
Personally, I do want to see a sequel, but only in the hope that they can get
it right next time.  As a fan of the novel, I eagerly awaited the film.  Now,
having seen the film, I am greatly disappointed by it - while the novel is a
fantastic, intricate, and highly imaginative piece of science fiction, the film
is a piece of something else entirely.

        In order to enjoy "Battlefield Earth," you don't necessarily
have to be the kind of person who speaks L. Ron Hubbard's name in hushed
tones and consults "Dianetics" every day. You need only be the kind of
person who'll willingly cough up your money to see a thoroughly
confused, exceptionally stupid action movie featuring a box office name
-- John Travolta, in case you hadn't heard -- who seems to be doing his
best to quickly destroy whatever clout he has with his audience. This is
his pet project, a $75 million sci-fi spectacle that finds him wobbling
around in the highest platform shoes since Elton John played the Pinball
Wizard in "Tommy" and sporting bizarre dreadlocks that make him look
like a cast-off from a reggae band. It's the oddest vanity production
imaginable, one in which the main attraction is nearly impossible to
recognize.
 But Travolta's hammy performance and sorry fashion sense are
the least of the movie's worries. Seemingly there wasn't enough even in
that lavish budget to buy a few decent special effects or to hire
screenwriters who could make a coherent story out of Hubbard's
doorstop-sized novel. Matters are not helped by director Roger
Christian's insistence on shooting almost every scene with a
headache-inducing tilted camera and employing slow-motion and echoing
dialogue, the telling signs of a hack filmmaker.
 Set in the year 3000, "Earth" predicts a world in which humans
are hunted down and enslaved by sinister alien Psychlos, who have
ravaged our planet and forced the few unlucky survivors to hide out in
caves, where they dress in pelts and buckskin, wear wispy little braids
and murmur about the "demons" who haunt the "forbidden land."
 As a rule, science-fiction demands a leap of faith, but
"Battlefield Earth" is so patently absurd only the dimmest audience
members will be able to put up with it. For example, the Psychlos, of
which nine-foot-tall Terl (Travolta) is the leader, spend much of their
time bragging about their superior intellect, yet they're dumb enough to
plop what looks like an overgrown jellyfish on top of their "man-animal"
prisoner Jonnie Goodboy (Barry Pepper, who goes through the entire movie
slack-jawed and wide-eyed) and zap all their secrets into his primitive
brain. Jonnie then goes on to rally his fellow cave-dwellers to revolt
against the giants by stealing Harrier jets and attacking the Psychlos'
domed city.
 Yes, you read correctly: We are treated to the sight of
spear-rattling cavemen jumping into high-tech fighter planes. Even the
infamously tacky filmmaker Ed Wood Jr. never thought of that one.
 Also, despite the fact that the action takes place 1,000 years
from now, somehow such 20th-century relics as Putt-Putt golf courses,
parking ramps and mannequins have managed to remain intact. Ditto the
books in the Library of Congress, where Jonnie stops by for a crash
course on human rights.
 Then, when the humans are forced to mine gold in the Colorado
hills, Terl issues a stern warning that he'll be watching them.
Obviously not very closely, since Jonnie and his crew manage to steal an
aircraft and fly all the way to Fort Knox and back without a hitch.
 We're expected to root for the man-animals to take back control
of the Earth from these extraterrestrial invaders, but there's not a
single interesting character among the bunch. At least the Psychlos have
some personality: Travolta and his sidekick Forrest Whitaker snipe at
each other like they're auditioning for the sci-fi remake of "The
Birdcage."
 About halfway through the film's interminable two hours, you're
bound to grow nostalgic for such other ill-advised star vehicles as
Kevin Costner's "The Postman" and Bruce Willis' "Hudson Hawk." Even
those clunkers were far easier to sit through than this.
 To add a bit of extra campiness to his performance, Travolta
punctuates every third line with a booming theatrical chuckle. Let's see
who's laughing after his fans find out just how abysmal "Battlefield
Earth" truly is. James Sanford

Anyone who ever read John Campbell's "Astounding" or "Analog"
magazines, or admired a painting by Frank Kelly Freas will
recognize what has been accomplished in the film version of
"Battlefield Earth." This is real science fiction on an epic
scale. The heroes have to use their brains. The villains take
too much for granted.
Some of the reviews I've seen appearing are by critics who
take too much for granted. It is painfully obvious when a
reviewer hasn't bothered to see the film he lambastes. One
reviewer was babbling about robots and puppets. What movie
is that, hmmm?
Look, H.G. Wells was a Socialist. But you don't have to be a
Socialist to enjoy "The War of the Worlds"! C.S. Lewis was a
Christian. But you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy the
Narnia books!
The point should be obvious. L. Ron Hubbard was a great science
fiction writer. "Battlefield Earth" is one of his best stories.
Roger Christian has made a fine film and if there are any hidden
messages, it is that kids should read books.
John Travolta plays the most sarcastic villain in the history of
motion pictures. That alone would justify seeing the film but
there is much more. Barry Pepper, Kim Coates, Christian Tessier
and the rest of the freedom fighters make you believe that the
human race will never be defeated. On the other side, Forest
Whitaker provides a superb foil for Travolta's character.
Between the two of them we experience the Satanic side of
bureaucracy.
When I saw this film at its Hollywood premiere, I paid close
attention to the kids in the audience. They don't have any agendas.
They just want to have a good time. They could tell the good guys
from the bad guys. They loved the action and explosions and here's
the most important part: they didn't run to the concession stand
during the dialog scenes.
I'd like to see someone try and convince them that they didn't
really enjoy the movie.

_Battlefield_Earth:_A_Saga_of_the_Year_3000_ (PG-13) no stars (out of
****)
Although trailers for _Battlefield_Earth_ have been playing in
moviehouses since December, the reaction has remained constant over the
last few months.  With each new audience for each different film at each
different time of day, no less than thunderous peals of derisive laughter
greet the sight of John Travolta done up like a ten-foot-tall alien beast
bearing talons and a moptop of dreadlocks.  The television ad campaign,
bearing the ludicrous catch phrase "Get Psychlo!" (Psychlo being the name
of the monstrous alien race), has done little to change the negative
public perception.
That said, I must give credit to the Warner Bros. marketing people.  As
poor as all the ads look, they don't even begin to touch upon the
unfathomable awfulness of _Battlefield_Earth:_A_Saga_of_the_Year_3000_
(the film's full, onscreen title).  Not only is it hardly presumptuous to
declare it the worst film of the year 2000, it is no exaggeration to call
this wretched piece of incompetence one of the worst films ever made.
As stated by the complete title, the film takes place in the year 3000
A.D., where the planet is in post-apocalyptic ruins after being taken
over by the evil alien race from the planet Psychlo a thousand years
prior.  "Man is an endangered species," as an insanely large text card
states, with most of the remaining humans being held prisoner and/or
enslaved by giant, grotesque Psychlo.  A certain few, however, live
freely as primitives in secluded mountain villages.  One such person is a
bright, resourceful young hunter (Barry Pepper) who may very well be the
one to lead the human race to winning back its freedom from the alien
invaders.
That summary could've been written by anyone who had just seen
_Battlefield_'s trailer, which makes clear what is completely incoherent
in the complete film.  _Battlefield_ tells a simple, simplistic story,
but somehow director Roger Christian and screenwriters Corey Mandell and
JD Shapiro have made it virtually incomprehensible.  After twenty or so
dead-end minutes of people wandering through an obviously
matte-composited wasteland comes the first of the showcase action
scenes--which are all haphazardly cut and slow-mo'ed to oblivion. 
Pepper's doozy of a character name--Jonnie Goodboy Tyler--is not made
evident until about halfway through the film.  But at least his name has
a consistent pronunciation, unlike that of Terl (Travolta, who also
produced), the "head of security" for the aliens' Earth operation;
sometimes it rhymes with "girl" and other times it rhymes with "Carol." 
However you say his name, Terl devises some sort of evil scheme against
his superiors after being passed up for a cushier job (yes, even aliens
get frustrated by career stagnation), but it beats me just how exactly
it's supposed to work.  Even so, his plan is not nearly as nonsensical as
the humans' plan for revolt.
Travolta has called Terl "the definitive evil character."  With creature
designer Patrick Tatopoulos failing to come up with a menacing look for
the Psychlo--their appearance looks ridiculously slapped together from
bits of cheap leftover Klingon and rastafarian costumes, with a touch of
bondage gear thrown in--it's up to Travolta to turn Terl into a
convincingly vicious, truly hateful villain.  But his smug, jokey take on
the character is a complete miscalculation.  A similar approach worked
for him as the bad guy in John Woo's _Broken_Arrow_, but there that flip
cockiness fit the quirky character.  Terl is supposed to be pure,
unironic evil--not so much a character to hate as one to feel genuinely
threatened by.  With Travolta punctuating nearly every passage of
dialogue with a ridiculously overdone "evil" cackle, it's little wonder
that Terl--and, consequently, the film--can never be taken seriously.
However, the filmmakers take _Battlefield_Earth_ extremely seriously,
and their reverence of the source novel--and its writer, Church of
Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard--blinds them to the fact that the
story they're trying to adapt is nothing more than a pulpy genre piece,
not an "important" work of literature.  Hence, the film is riddled with
laughable and utterly baffling moments of self-importance: a crowd is
inspired to give exuberantly savage grunts and barks--by flowery
statements about the value of freedom; pseudo-profound ruminations about
destiny incongruously pop up during a big prison break sequence.  People
who treat lines like "We're gonna blow up their planet.  Needless to say,
we're gonna need more supplies before we do that" with grave seriousness
are in no position to condescend to their audience, but that's exactly
what Christian does.  At one point, Jonnie is shown reading a
reproduction of the Declaration of Independence, but so ignorant are we
movie audiences that he has to then flip to a page that says "Declaration
of Independence" in huge type.
Usually a subpar sci-fi film can at least fall back on its visuals, but
_Battlefield_Earth_ can't even count that as a saving grace.  Forget the
not-so-special effects--Christian and his crew can't even get the basics
right; the rubbery Psychlo creature design is just the tip of the
iceberg.  Matte paintings are not only obvious, the image compositing is
shockingly inept; the three-dimensional actors are clearly standing in
front of flat backdrops.  The would-be futuristic weaponry and gadgets
don't look quite as state-of-the-art as stuff you'd find on a toy store
shelf.
Catch Travolta on any talk or magazine show, and you'll see him all
smiles over  _Battlefield_Earth_.  Exactly why is up for question.  Given
the fact that he's tried to bring to the project to the big screen for
nearly twenty years, the obvious read is that he's beaming with pride
that it finally came to fruition.  But after seeing the  final product, I
cannot help but think that maybe, just maybe, he's laughing that he was
able to sucker otherwise sensible people into pouring tens of millions of
dollars toward making such an unspeakable, inexcusable waste.

If a major religion decides to sink nearly an hundred million dollars
into a movie version of a scifi novel, couldn't they at least have
picked a decent author?
I must confess, I don't really know anything about Scientology, and
although I've seen the book Dianetics on the night table of various
roommates in college, I've never read it and have absolutely no idea
what's in it.  I walked past the bright yellow Scientology sign in
downtown Portland without ever having the urge to find out more about
it.  I'm dimly aware that there is some controversy surrounding the
funding of the film, but don't feel qualified to talk about it.
But God, what a movie.  I do not mean that in a positive way.  How do
movies like this get made?
Before I start, I'd like to say that I absolutely do not believe, as
reported by other reviewers,  that Scientologists have been assigned
to break the kneecaps of anyone giving a less-than-favorable review of
this turkey.  From what I've read so far, they'd have to take out
practically every professional film critic, a move that surely would
have been reported in the popular media.
Nor do I believe the story that "hollow-eyed Scientologists are
passing out free tickets on streetcorners so that the movie will have
a good opening weekend".  First of all, I haven't seen anyone doing
any such thing, and secondly, all three of the screens in which it was
playing Saturday May 13 at the multiplex in Hillsborough, Oregon were
barren.  (I know this because I didn't catch the theater number at the
ticket counter and had to ferry the family's popcorn and drinks
through each one until I found them.)  If they *are* passing out free
tickets, they've been profoundly unsuccessful at it.  And if Regal
Cinemas thought Battlefield Earth would have the kind of opening as,
for instance, Gladiator, they're now profoundly disappointed.
There's no decent way to say it.  This movie sucks.  There really is
absolutely no reason why a reasonable person would waste his time
seeing it.  Really horrible dialog, laughable makeup, surprisingly
un-special effects for the purported $90 million cost of the film, and
a plot that leaves all thinking beings going "Hunh?"
My daughter was bored out of her skull, and kept asking "is the movie
about over?"  Now, to put this in perspective, she *liked* Supernova.
She saw Batman and Robin *twice*.  She sat thorough all 3 hours of
Titanic and wanted to see it again.  But about 20 minutes into
Battlefield Earth she was done.  I don't know how many times I'll have
to sit through Dinosaur to make it up to her.
John Travolta puts in the performance of his life.  I mean that
literally.  He seemed to be determined to put every ounce of his not
inconsiderable talent into single-handedly saving this film from being
the most expensive direct-to-video release ever.  If you absolutely
must see this film, (as I did -- my wife, a rabid "saturday night
fever" fan,  forced me) watch the scenes with Travolta and snore
through the rest.
But this is not unusual for Travolta, post-comeback.  His performance
was the best, make that the only, thing watchable about "Broken
Arrow".  You have to give him this -- he plays larger-than-life
villains to absolute perfection, and his "Terl" is a masterpiece.  But
just as a masterful performance by Tim Curry in Legend couldn't save
that film, Travolta has been given too great a task to pull
Battlefield Earth out of the muck.
How can I say this?  It was a horrible experience.  If the theater had
paid *us* eight bucks a seat to sit through this piece of crap, I
would still feel cheated.
My wife owes me big time.  And on the day before Mother's Day.  Ouch.

Rated PG-13: Sci-fi action, violence, language.
Starring: John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker.
So I went and saw this film right, it was called "Battlefield: Earth", I was
never interested in the previews, and never too terribly interested in the
book, nor do I find scientology interesting, but after reading advanced reviews
of how bad this film really is, I had that weird urge just to watch it. Well
let me be the first to say, and so far in my view it's safe to say:
Battlefield: Earth might be the worst film I have ever seen, yes even worse
than "Mr. Magoo", "Blue In The Face", or "Jaws: The Revenge".
Roger Christianson whos credits include set direction, and art direction for
such great films as "Alien" and "Star Wars", directs this film with such
amateurism, that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb, that it's
quite depressing. The look of the film, is dark and drabby at times, but then
bright and happy at other times. The sound is terrible, and has the worst
surround sound effects I've heard. The acting is nothing, the dialogue poor,
and the make-up effects hideous.
Here's the so-called plot: Earth 3000....man is a endangered species, while
aliens from the planet Psychlo (the aliens are named Psychlo...I wonder why?!)
are invading Earth, destined to put an end to those "man-animals" to an end,
and destroy Earth once and for all, of course we have our typical hero (played
terrible by Barry Pepper, who was great in a small role in 1999's "The Green
Mile") who is destined to go out, and save his planet! One thing: he has to go
up against, Terl, the chief of security Psychlo, who is played frankly, quite
bad by John Travolta, whom with dreadlocks, a big head, and green eyes just
doesn't work. Of course the sidekick to Terl, is played by (LOL!!) Forest
Whitaker, who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind. Our friendly human
Johnny (Barry Pepper) looks just as bad as well, with long scraggly hair.
I'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film, except just
to say it's terrible. Everything in this film is imcomprehinsable, from the
make-up effects, which by the way aren't good, to the phony looking special
effects, everything in this film is faulted. In fact I don't remember one part
in this entire movie where I was having a good time, or enjoying myself. In
fact there is no part in the movie that I liked or enjoyed. Throughout the
entire 127 minute running time, I was dying, constantly looking at my watch,
and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something, sadly it
didn't.
My advice to Hollywood: Get new scripts, new acting classes, better directors
and damnit, make films like American Beauty More.

There are two things the American film industry should avoid at all
costs.  One is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her
favorite novels into a feature film.  Two is never greenlight a sci-fi
film starring John Travolta.  To wit, we present the disaster that is
Battlefield Earth.
A science-fiction opus starring the Barbarino of the Actors Guild,
Battlefield Earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when
a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior.  Sci-fi is always a
tricky beast: Tight script, a good director, an ensemble cast of decent
actors, and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of
disbeliefs.  Battlefield Earth fails at achieving even one of these
attributes.
Here's the `plot.'  The year is 3000.  Mankind has been become an
endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the
Psychlos (sounds like either the latest clown act from Cirque de Soleil
or a white rap group).  A small band of humans dwell in radioactive
caves located in the Rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the
cities below.  The Psychlos are strip-mining the Earth for its resources
and Terel, played by Travolta, is the head of security for the
mining/slave base located in Denver.
A young rogue named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, played with dramatic flair by
Barry Pepper, ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to
uncover the truth about the `demons.'  He is promptly captured and taken
to the alien base.  After several attempts at escape, Johnnie is placed
in the middle of an underhanded subplot of Terel's, involving
circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the Rockies to his own end.
Jonnie, assumed leader of the mining slave group, then manages to attain
all Psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine Terel
forces him to use.  Then the story just runs along until Jonnie teaches
the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry, the Bill of Rights,
how to use a machine gun, and how to fly a Harrier jet.  The whole mess
concludes with a big, loud, obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me
praying for the end credits.
Roger Christian, the director of this lumbering beast, must have rented
Dune, Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Stargate,
Beastmaster, the Airwolf episodes, the `V' miniseries, The Matrix, and
The Omega Man... and decided to steal every scene he could for
Battlefield Earth.  Christian even shoots every scene in a weird Dutch
angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie!  And every
scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really.
The Psychlos reminded me of a cross between Jamaican basketball players
with bad teeth and bloated hands and Klingon extras working the Star
Trek convention circuit.  Travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since
The Experts or maybe Perfect.  Jonnie Goodboy Tyler evolves into William
Wallace with lines like `You can have your freedom if you fight!'  Then
there's the script: The film just never convinces you that the plight of
Jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet'
would be a difficult task to achieve.  Why?  Because Terel provides all
the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason
beside the fact that `humans are stupid.'
Terel may be right, you know.  Humans made this movie.
Director: Roger Christian
Starring: John Travolta, Forrest Whitaker, Barry Pepper, Kim Coates,
Richard Tyson

To watch `Battlefield Earth' is to wallow in misery. 
It is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in
recent history.  It has a clumsily told story, insipid
dialogue, shallow characterizations, ugly scene
transitions, no evidence of dramatic arc,
headache-inducing sound effects, and a resolution that
is completely implausible.  Worse, there's the promise
of a sequel.  Why?!  Save your money.  Some films go
quickly to video.  This one, however, should go
straight to the Sci-Fi Channel's `Mystery Science
Theatre.'
In the year 3000, Man has become an endangered
species.  Most of humanity (called man-animals') was
destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race
of plundering aliens (called Psychlos).  Survivors
have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved
to mine Earth's resources for the rest of their lives.
The aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species
that stand nine-feet tall, who resemble inbred
Klingons.  Dimwitted as they are tall, their culture
is predicated on power, extortion, and getting
leverage.'  Travolta, the leverage-using star, plays
Terl, the conniving security chief that oversees the
mining facility on Earth.  Much of the movie is spent
showing us examples of Terl's petty machinations.  He
routinely employs deception and then punctuates his
statements with maniacal laughter.  But one thing is
certain; he hates being stationed on Earth.  When the
home planet informs him that he will be spending the
rest of his life on this planet, he begins to devise
his latest plan.
He will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out
a gold ore site.  It's not clear how this benefits
Terl, except that it makes him richer in a place where
he has no use for it.  The scrappy Jonnie Goodboy
Tyler (Barry Peppers) is selected as the slave group's
leader.  A Psychlo knowledge machine gives him the
mining know-how.  But the machine also teaches him
other things such as the Psychlo language, the
principles of our founding fathers, Euclidean
geometry, and the location of Fort Knox.  This
enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining
assignment.  It also prepares him to organize and
stage a massive revolt against their captors.  `We're
going to blow up their home world,' he says.  `But
first, we need a few more supplies.'  In days, he and
his comrades evolve from cave dwelling, loincloth
wearing, rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and
nuclear weapons experts.  By now, the audience is
laughing as maniacally as Terl.
The media have been working overtime to let the public
know that John Travolta's labor of love is a piece of
sci-fi drivel.  Numerous journals have called it an
ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris,
arrogance, and poor planning.   And after watching
this movie, you'll wholeheartedly agree.  This is a
terrible film that is illogically constructed,
tediously acted, and frequently begs the question: Why
was this ever made?   At a price tag of $90 million,
this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly,
assuredly becoming `The Avengers' of this summer. 
Both films were unforgivable and this promises to
suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity. 
In addition to the universally pejorative reviews,
there's another bizarre element to the `Battlefield'
saga.  This film would never have been made if not for
the star power of Travolta, who for over a decade, had
been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to
the big screen.  The controversy is that Travolta is a
Scientologist, and `Battlefield' is based on a 1982
novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the religion's late founder. 
This led some to believe that `Battlefield Earth'
would amount to Scientologist dogma, laden with
subliminal messages.  But the story is so poorly told
that any message, subliminal or otherwise, is totally
undetectable.  If the audience got anything out of
this film, it was this: we are not too unlike the
Psychlo leader.  Like Terl, the audience felt
imprisoned, dreaded their situation, and looked for
any opportunity to leave.  Could that be the
Scientology message?

Here it is, ladies and gentlemen: the worst film of the year 2000.  I say
this in blanket confidence because if there is a film worse than
"Battlefield Earth", I don't want to know it exists.  I'll take my chances
with being wrong.
Derived from the only-science-fiction-by-association novel of the same name
by L. Ron Hubbard, "Battlefield Earth" opens in the year 3000, when a bunch
of aliens named the Psychlos have taken over the world.  Humanity has
descended to the stone-age level.  The head Psychlo on Earth, Terl (John
Travolta), has literally struck gold and has a plan to have human slaves
mine the gold out for him.  He also engages in some dimwitted blackmail
scheme with his fellow Psychlos, a plot item that feels more at home on one
of those websites where someone puts a secret camera in a restroom.
The human hero, Jonnie "Goodboy" Tyler (Barry Pepper), winds up becoming the
chief guinea pig in Terl's schemes.  He manages to organize a human-led
revolt, in scenes of such astounding stupidity and incompetence that B-movie
directors like William "One-Shot" Beaudine would be holding in their sides
with laughter.  Does anyone here believe for a second that a flight
simulator -- or for that matter a fighter jet -- would still be working
after a thousand years?  Or that there would still be fuel, electricity,
spare parts and so on just lying around?  I've never seen so many people
work so hard to defy common sense and logic at every turn.
John Travolta is not a bad actor, but he is completely wasted in a movie
that does not give him anything better to do other than stomp around and
gloat unconvincingly.  He's just not a very good bad guy -- we've got far
too much of a nice-guy teddy-bear persona in mind for him already, a problem
that dogged him in "Broken Arrow" as well.  His one really menacing thing to
do, other than laugh, is Narrow His Eyes.  With all the mugging that goes
on, this might as well be a silent film with title cards.  Come to think of
it, that alone might make it more entertaining.
In a film loaded with bad things, the worst thing is probably the movie's
obsessive-compulsive ugliness.  The Psychlos look like nine-foot-tall
rejects from a Rastafarian cover band that plays Kiss.  Every set is dark,
cramped, trash-strewn and badly photographed.  The sound effects are
nerve-deadening. The camera looks at everything like someone ran into it
full-tilt before it was switched on.  I've seen films made on digital video
in people's basements that looked better than this.
THe film's one claim to fame is its origins: L. Ron Hubbard is also the
creator of the controversial Church of Scientology.  But the film is devoid
of anything to explicitly connect it with Scientology, just as it is devoid
of anything to explicitly connect it with entertainment, thought, feeling,
or coherency.  Maybe that's for the better.

     BATTLEFIELD EARTH ... is ... 117 minutes ... long ... which is
... plenty long enough ... to spend ... watching ... a very ... bad
... film ... but I grew even ... more ... annoyed ... when I realized
... the film ... could have been ... at least ... 15 minutes ... shorter
... (therefore ending ... all our torment ... 15 minutes ... sooner) 
... if someone ... had told ... director Roger Christian ... to stop
... using ... slow ... motion ... for ... every ... freaking ... action
... scene.
     Lousy summer action films are nothing new. It is still a bit
shocking, however, when you have the misfortune to stumble upon one so
fundamentally inept even as grandiose adventure. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is such
a shambling behemoth, a film not even bad enough to be funny-bad (at least
not often enough). Based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, it tells of an
earth 1,000 years after a conquering alien invasion by the profit-hungry
Psychlo race. Bands of humans live primitive hunter-gatherer lives on the
outskirts of the Psychlo mining colony in Denver, while most humans work
as slave labor. Leading the Psychlo security force is the arrogant Terl
(John Travolta), embittered by his posting on earth and prepared to con
his superiors out of a recently-discovered gold deposit. But he's about to
meet his match in Jonnie (Barry Pepper), a feisty human keen on leading a
rebellion against the Psychlos.
     I've never read the L. Ron Hubbard novel on which BATTLEFIELD EARTH
is based, so I don't know how much of the film's narrative idiocy is his
responsibility. I do know that the film could set you to scratching your
head so furiously you could draw blood. How is it that in 1,000 years of
occupation strictly for the purpose of acquiring precious metals, none of
the Psychlos bothered to investigate Fort Knox, or noticed the big glowing
vein of gold in the rocks a few miles from their headquarters? What
miraculous change in the planet's weather patterns allowed books in the
Denver Library to survive 1,000 years' exposure to Rocky Mountain winters? 
And would it have been so hard to explain why the Psychlos' domed habitat
is so strategically important when both humans and Psychlos must wear
breathing devices (strangely like high-tech Breathe Right strips) in order
to survive inside it?
     Even with so much slipshod storytelling involved, I might have
settled for an action-adventure that seemed concerned about making its
action somewhat ... adventurous. Instead, Roger Christian turns every
confrontation, every chase and every battle into parade of slow-motion
explosions. The device has certainly become popular thanks to Hong Kong
directors like John Woo, but in such cases the film-maker is usually
giving viewers the opportunity to appreciate a particularly cool stunt, or
Chow Yun-Fat flying through the air with a pair of guns blazing. 
Christian, on the other hand, uses slow-motion to turn the film into an
agonizing crawl towards its conclusion. It's clear he wants BATTLEFIELD
EARTH to be something epic and mythological; the frequent George Lucas
collaborator even uses the familiar wipe-dissolves from the STAR WARS
films. In Christian's hands, unfortunately, the wipes are yet another way
he takes us far too slowly from one place to another. You know a film is
failing on its most fundamental level when an entire sell-out preview
audience responds to the climactic explosion with stony silence.
     BATTLEFIELD EARTH does offer the chance to watch Travolta -- who has
shown no reluctance to ham up his villainous characters in films like
BROKEN ARROW and FACE/OFF -- whooping it up as the gleefully duplicitous
Terl, which occasionally makes the film watchable. Sadly, his gusto only
makes it evident that someone involved in the film was actually trying to
make it watchable. It certainly wasn't the casting director, who chose as 
a protagonist the capable but uncharismatic Pepper (who may just be the
separated-at-birth triplet sibling of Skeet Ulrich and Johnny Depp). It
wasn't screenwriter Corey Mandell, whose gifts for absurd plotting are
rivaled only by his deft way with mangling dialogue and character
development. And it wasn't Roger Christian, who appears to have learned
absolutely nothing about pacing from his work as second unit director with 
Lucas. In his attempt to tell a "saga of the year 3000," Christian has
chosen ... the sneaky trick ... of making ... the film ... so ... plodding
... that you'll leave ... the theater ... wondering ... whether ... 1,000
years ... have ... passed ... since ... you ... went ... in.

I sometimes get angry, looking at the smug cynicism of organisations like the 
Golden Raspberry Awards and www.thestinkers.com, which exist to discuss bad 
movies. After a while they forget about their purpose, and just rip into 
everything they can, regardless of the quality. It takes a movie like 
"Battlefield Earth" to remind us why they were formed in the first place; 
it's a big-scale disaster that brings back memories of all the shoddy 
space-opera crap that came out when I was a kid in the 80s. Watching those 
grainy tapes in the early days of VHS, I wondered what the same crappy 
special effects and drab colours would look like on the big screen. Now I 
know.
"Battlefield Earth" is based on a novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the 
new-age religion Scientology, but if the book contains any moral messages or 
symbols, then they've been lost in the transition to the screen, in favour of 
dimensionless sci-fi. The story takes place in the year 3000. An alien race, 
the Psychlos, has taken over Earth, and man is an endangered species. The few 
humans who are not enslaved in manual labour camps roam the countryside, 
hunting for food and making weird noises, like cavemen.
The hero of the movie is one of these Neanderthal chaps, Johnny Goodboy Tyler 
(Barry Pepper), who announces, in his own grunting way, that he is going to 
find the Psychlos, arrange a revolt against them and reclaim the planet. When 
his plan gets underway, Johnny comes to the attention of Terl (John Travolta) 
and Ker (Forest Whitaker), two chiefs of staff in the Psychlos' security 
command. They try to stop him by keeping him busy, having him mine gold for 
them in some kind of secret corrupt operation.
Humans grumble, aliens snarl, and then there's an action climax that attempts 
to rip off the Death Star attack in "Star Wars" but looks more like an Atari 
game. Throughout everything, plot holes and contradictions abound. At the 
start of the movie, everyone has to wear breathing apparatus resembling big 
lines of snot, because Earth air is unbreathable -- people are even executed 
by being deprived of their tubes. Next thing you know, Terl comes up with his 
idea of having humans mine for gold, because they don't need breathing 
apparatus. Eh? How about the fact that the Psychlos are obviously a bunch of 
incompetents who can be defeated by rebellious cavemen, and yet they 
apparently conquered all human armies in nine minutes? Why doesn't Terl have 
a clue about human levels of intelligence or behaviour patterns, when he has 
a computer programme full of details about our languages, history, biology 
and technology? Why does Terl want to mine gold, when it is a worthless 
substance to the Psychlos? Why does Johnny seize Terl's gun, make a rousing 
speech about how human comrades should fight for freedom, then return the gun 
and go back to work??
The production values are just as inexplicable. Travolta and Whitaker are 
virtually unrecognisable underneath pounds of rotten makeup, they talk like 
drunkards telling jokes, and they wear codpieces that restrict their 
movements. And everything is seen in tilt shots or slow motion, through a 
pall of bluish mist that makes everything look grubby. Although special 
effects have improved dramatically in the last twenty years, those in 
"Battlefield Earth" are a throwback to worse times -- the soundtrack is made 
up of distorted echoes, and the visuals are a collection of blurred model 
shots and weird-looking props scattered around cheap sets.
The movie is so outrageously, spectacularly, unbelievably bad that we stare 
at it with some sort of appalled curiosity. It fails on so many levels that 
it's fascinating, although not so much that I'd sit through it again. 
Remember all that "Who Shot JR?" merchandise? Maybe one day they'll also have 
T-shirts and bumper stickers declaring "I SAT THROUGH BATTLEFIELD EARTH!"

Battlefield long, boring and just plain stupid
In my mid-teen years, I had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare. Behind
the wheel of a car, I was driving down a straight road in the middle of
a desert. No scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel
lines of the highway. No matter what I did, the view didn't change:
travelling but not getting anywhere. Each time I awoke in a sweat, terrified.
You don't have to be Carl Jung to understand that dream. Powerless to
make changes, trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue, this
is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake.
This is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "Battlefield Earth"
begins. For all of its flash and style, L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction
epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000.
Dull "and" stupid.
In the year 3000, the Psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1,000
years. Humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as
barbarians. There's no hope. The future is bleak.
Then the Psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty Jonnie Goodboy Tyler
(Barry Pepper) who organizes a revolution against Chief Of Security Terl
(John Travolta) and the alien race.
It's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise. Considering
some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen,
it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably. But it does.
The story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the
opening credits. Are we really supposed to believe that after a
millennium of looking for gold, the Psychlo never discovered Fort Knox?
Or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that
time -- and gassed up? Or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in
seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships? Or that
the Psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are
missing for days?
Travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and
is almost entertaining. Almost. The rest of the actors are wooden
mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person --
"man-animal" or not -- would ever utter.
Some of the film _looks_ good, but it also looks so familiar. A race of
large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our
cities lie in ruin. Sound like something Charlton Heston might be in?
The Psychlo look like overweight Klingons in gear from "Dune". The final
air battle between the Air Force fighters and the Psychlo ships in their
high-tech city is something George Lucas might have been associated with.
It's too loud. It's too oppressive. It's too slow. It's too long...far
too long. And on it goes. The list of the problems with "Battlefield
Earth" is endless. It's difficult to find anything in the film that does work.
The real question is how this movie ever got made. Could it have
something to do with the fact that L. Ron Hubbard was the founder of
Scientology? And that John Travolta is a member of the church.
That might explain why Travolta bought the rights to the novel years
ago. But it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter
Corey Mandell's atrocious script was used. Or why the high-profile
project was entrusted with Roger Christian who had never before directed
a major film.
Or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized
there might be problems.
The one bright spot is that no longer will Kevin Costner's "The Postman"
(which I begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure) be "the" big budget
science fiction failure. "Battlefield Earth" has the honor sewed up.
Often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for
the video. That's not the case here. You can act now and make the
decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one. Don't
hesitate. Strike now while the iron is cold.

 Battlefield Earth (2000) No stars out of 4. Starring John Travolta,
Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates and Richard Tyson. Screenplay
by Corey Mandell and JD Shapiro. Based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard.
Directed by Roger Christian.
 OK, bear with me now. Here's my theory. "Battlefield Earth" was meant
to be "The Producers" of the science fiction genre.
 You remember "The Producers," don't you? Mel Brooks comedy about two
men (Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder) who decide to make a fortune by
producing the worst play ever written. They sell about 1,000 percent of
the play to various investors because they believe it will close after
one night and they can just keep the money.
 They hire the worst director and cast the most inept actors. But
something goes wrong and the play becomes a hit. Thus Mostel and Wilder
go to jail for embezzlement.
  So, how does this relate to "Battlefield Earth." Well, John Travolta,
who is listed as one of the film's producers, seems to have taken the
opposite tact. He hired whom he believed were the best actors - himself
included - as well as the strongest writers to adapt L. Ron Hubbard's
massive novel and the correct director to helm the opus.
  Well "Battlefield Earth" is no "Springtime for Hitler." If only
Travolta and company had played "Battlefield Earth" as a send-up, a
parody, a satire, anything but a straight, dramatic vehicle. If they had
just been able to put their tongues in their cheeks and say, "Come on,
folks. We're having a great time kidding around."
  Maybe some blooper outtakes during the closing credits. Anything.
 Unfortunately, "Battlefield Earth" take itself seriously, way too
seriously. And because of that, it is one of the most wretched,
embarrassing and clumsy features ever put on celluloid.
  It is a movie that makes you cringe and chuckle simultaneously. You
sit in disbelief as this lumbering behemoth staggers along. You watch in
amazement as Travolta gives the worst performance of his career.
  And you wonder: What was he thinking? Could his passion for the novel
so overwhelmed his sense of judgment that he would allow himself to be
ridiculed in such a manner?
  Compared to Travolta, Kevin Costner's turns in "Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves," "Waterworld" and "The Postman" and nearly Shakespearean.
  Travolta goes through the film spewing inane dialogue and laughing
like a straight-jacketed man in a padded cell. The laugh is neither
menacing nor evil, merely obnoxious.
  Most every line in "Battlefield Earth" is spoken with an exclamation
point. Every plot turn and revelation is punctuated with Elia Cmiral's
overwrought music.
  There is no point dissing the cast members. Most of them have done
fine work in previous films. And every actor is entitled to his
"Parnell." (Clark Gable fans will understand the reference.)
 The plot is ridiculous, The action - even by s-f standards - beyond
belief. Humans, reduced to almost caveman-like existence, teach
themselves to fly sophisticated fighter jets in a week. Not to mention
the jets and their payload of weapons are in perfect condition after
1,000 years of inattention.
  At least give the audience some credit for having brains.
  There is really no need to go on. "Battlefield Earth" is a major
blunder. It will go down in history with such infamous titles as "Hudson
Hawk," "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Showgirls."
  However, to be fair. "Battlefield Earth" can have one positive
purpose. It can be used by film schools as a teaching lesson. It can
stand as the quintessential example of big moviemaking ineptitude.

In BATTLEFIELD EARTH, grown men get to dress up like Klingons having bad
hair days, while uttering some of the silliest dialog this side of a bad
1950s sci-fi flick.  The theater should be required to have signs
warning customers: "Ye who enter in must be prepared to completely
suspend disbelief."  Although the film has a few nice, but too dark,
special effects, the only reason to see the it is as a guilty pleasure,
so you can laugh at John Travolta in an embarrassingly bad performance.
His character laughs a lot, too - a hearty and silly "Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha,"
like a busted toy action figure whose voice chip is stuck in a loop.
Directed confusingly by Roger Christian (MASTERMINDS) and adapted for
the screen by first-timer Corey Mandell, the film is based, as most
people know, on the science fiction novel of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder
of the Church of Scientology.  One can only hope the book was more
intelligent than it is portrayed on the screen.
Earth, we learn, in 3000 AD will look a lot like 3000 BC, thanks to our
having lost a 9-minute war with the Psychlos, an alien race who has no
respect for "man animals" or our "puny sized planet."  Earthlings have
been reduced to cavemen, who worship the stars in the heavens as gods.
In an over-the-top performance, John Travolta plays Terl, the Psychlos'
security chief for earth and the story's main villain.  He is a
slimeball who is hated by man animals and  other Psychlos, as well.
(You'll be forced to stare at the Psychlos' ugly pusses and dirty teeth
in endless close-ups until you're ready to surrender.)  Even Terl's
superiors hate him.  "Look up," a visiting mucky-muck tells him.  "One
day, you'll die.  And when you end up in hell, it'll be a step up from
this planet."  Poor earth, which is mainly in ruins, gets dissed a lot
in the movie.
The cinematography uses various shades of a slimy blue-green.  The
picture tries hard to look gross and succeeds.  Just to make sure that
no one is surreptitiously having a good time, there are some raw rat
eating scenes tossed in to spice up the viewing.
Against this race of oppressors, a hero rises up to smite them down.  He
is Jonnie (Barry Pepper), a man animal whom Terl foolishly hooks up to
the Psychlos' learning machine.  The Psychlos, who act like imbeciles,
think man animals are so stupid that they can't even be taught how to
operate simple machinery and are good only for manual labor.
Try to count the number of films that the movie borrows from liberally.
First and foremost is STAR WARS, but others include BUTCH CASSIDY AND
THE SUNDANCE KID, STAR TREK, BRAVEHEART, BLADE RUNNER, PLANET OF THE
APES, MAD MAX and Wagner's "The Ring" series of operas.  But whereas the
originals are engrossing, BATTLEFIELD EARTH is long and tedious.
As a guilty pleasure, nothing is better than BATTLEFIELD EARTH's totally
preposterous concluding segment.  As the cavemen keep saying "Piece of
cake," they become overnight experts in everything from advanced fighter
pilot skills to nuclear engineering.  Wow, can those guys ever crack a
book.  All of that time in the cave must have softened their brains into
veritable cranial sponges for knowledge, as they absorb facts at light
speed.
Whatever you do, try not to laugh.  It may spoil the effect for those
around you.  They may be buying the story, hook, line and stinker -- I
mean sinker.
BATTLEFIELD EARTH runs a long 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and
would be acceptable for teenagers.  Given the movie's dark intensity,
I'd be careful about taking kids under 13.

Directed by: Roger Christian
Written by: L. Ron Hubbard (novel), Corey Mandell
Once in a great while there comes a movie which is regarded as an instant
classic. Movies like "Ben Hur" and "The Godfather" were known to be great
films the moment they hit theaters. Roger Christian's "Battlefield Earth",
based on L. Ron Hubbard's thousand page epic, is not one of these movies.
"Battlefield Earth" is more akin to "Plan 9 From Outer Space"; a movie so
incredibly bad that it will one day develop a cult following. "Battlefield
Earth" is a movie words cannot adequately describe. I hate to say this, but
I truly believe it must be witnessed to be fully appreciated. Most bad films
have at least one redeeming quality to them; whether it be unintentional
laughs, one truly good scene, or some interesting special effects. This
movie somehow manages to possess no redeeming qualities. I must admit, it's
not an easy task creating such a movie, which is why they only come along
once in a great while. Appreciate this movie for the few weeks it will be in
theaters folks. You'll not see another one like it for a great while.
It's the 31st century, and man is an endangered species (so the opening
credits tell us in a cheap, green home computer font). The Psychlos, a race
of nine foot tall whiners, have taken over the planet in a battle which took
only nine minutes. Now, 1000 years later, there are only a handful of humans
remaining, and they are used as cheap labor by the Psychlos, led by the
maniacal Terl (John Travolta). A lone woodsman, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry
Pepper), is on a quest to find what happend to his people when he is
captured by the alien invaders. Found to be somewhat intelligent by the
Psychlos, he is trained in how to speak their language and handle their
machinery. Tyler soon decides that he must lead his people in a revolt or
the human race will become extinct. With nothing but his wits, a few fellow
captives, some explosives, and a handy fleet of Harrier jets, he leads his
people in a final strike against their oppressors.
Let me start by listing the things I liked about this film. Okay, now on to
the rest of the movie. You can tell from the opening titles that you're in
for a very bumpy ride. The picture leaps right into its narrative without
explaining anything. Instead, we meet Barry Pepper's ("Saving Private Ryan")
character, and before we know anything about him, he is off on his quest. In
fact, there is no emotional involvment with any character in this movie. At
one point, Terl has captured Tyler's girlfriend and threatens to kill her if
Tyler doesn't obey him. I think this was supposed to be an emotional scene,
watching Tyler grapple with how to save his girlfriend's life. The problem,
however, is that we know next to nothing about Tyler, and his girlfriend has
just been introduced so we couldn't care less about her. Things are even
worse with Tyler's comrades. they die all the time without anyone really
knowing just who died. Everytime anyone dies, the music blasts through the
theater, the characters scream silently, and the audience stares at the
screen in complete confusion about who just bit the dust.
Allow me to now list everything that is wrong with this movie. The scenery
is obviously fake and created mostly from models or really bad mat jobs
(watch for the mat job on a scene where a character falls off a cliff; it's
laughably bad). The special effects look like they were done on the same
home computer used for the opening credits. The costumes consist of cheap
looking furs for the humans and shoddy silver things for the aliens
(Travolta manages to appear even more overweight in his costume). The battle
scenes are shot entirely in slow motion and with no sound. These fights
consist of watching humans and aliens getting hit by little white bursts of
light which bounce off them but cause the victims to fall dead to the ground
(except Jonnie Tyler, who gets shot numerous times but always springs back).
The dialogue is amazingly cheesy, and is made even worse by the over-the-top
performances from all the cast members. The score is quite obnoxious,
booming dramatically through the speakers all the time regardless of what
the characters are doing. Barry Pepper raises his hand, the music booms
dramatically; Barry Pepper eats a raw rat, the score plays so loudly you'll
be vibrating in your chair. There is much more to hate in this film, but I
don't have room to mention it all in one review.
In case you're wondering just who Roger Christian is, allow me to give you a
quick biography. Christian is the fellow who directed 1997's "Masterminds",
and little else. He also worked as a crew member on the first "Star Wars"
movie, which would explain his affinity for using wipes. The problem is,
while George Lucas may have used all sorts of different wipes throughout the
"Star Wars" movies, Christian uses the same wipe over and over again in
"Battlefield Earth". The wipe starts in the middle and goes outward, again
and again, between nearly every scene. Not only is it amateurish to use the
same wipe repeatedly, but it's a cheap looking, unimaginative wipe. The
actors are given very little to do, and they chew the scenery like you've
never seen. Barry Pepper, who was interesting and a little creepy as the
Christian sniper in "Saving Private Ryan", is given nothing to do as the
always grunting Jonnie Tyler. John Travolta overacts like you've never seen
before, and rather than appearing menacing as I believe was intended, he
looks like an eight foot tall clown. Only Forest Whitaker ("Ghost Dog: The
Way of the Samurai"), playing Terl's henchman, appears to realize what a
horrendous movie he is in.
For nearly any science fiction film, a certain amount of suspension of
disbelief is necessary. "Battlefield Earth" requires more than any other
movie I have seen in recent years. Nearly every scene contains some
ludicrous idea that an eight year old wouldn't buy. Try this out: the
Psychlos are interested in mining gold from a mountain, and they use the
humans to do so. Jonnie Tyler, being the genius he now is, takes bricked
gold from Fort Knox and gives it to Terl in place of the gold they didn't
mine. There are two serious oversights here. First, Terl actually believes
that Tyler smelted the gold into bricks for him; second, Terl's scanners
could find gold ore in a mountain, but he couldn't find any sitting in a
demolished Fort Knox? Not ludicrous enough for you? Try this one on for
size: Tyler and his troops just happen to find a fleet of Harriers sitting
armed, fueled, and in perfect working order after one thousand years.
Tyler's men, who could barely speak intelligibly not too long ago, then
proceed to learn how to fly them like experts in less than a week. There are
dozens of examples like these two, but I've wasted enough time writing about
this stupid movie. I'd recommend "Battlefield Earth" to aspiring directors
so they can see how NOT to make a sci-fi movie, but to no one else under any
circumstances. The movie runs a torturous 117 minutes, and I give it one out
of five stars.

Susan Granger's review of "BATTLEFIELD EARTH" (Warner Bros.)
THE BACKGROUND AND THE CONTROVERSY: Since 1975, John Travolta has been
an outspoken devotee of Scientology, an "applied religious philosophy"
that claims to have millions of followers. Travolta credits its
founder, L. Ron Hubbard, for all his spiritual and worldly success and
fervently believes that Hubbard's writings, particularly "Dianetics,"
contains mankind's hope for salvation. Hubbard taught that Earthlings
are the pawns of aliens. He preached that psychiatry was a timeless
evil, that, in a distant galaxy, alien "psychs" devised implants that
would ultimately wreck the spiritual progress of humans. The psychs
and their "blackened souls" are to blame for sin, violence, and
crime. In addition to his religious writing, Hubbard also wrote
science-fiction and, for 15 years, Travolta has been trying bring this
Hubbard tale to the screen. But Scientology is controversial, teaching
that a "suppressive" person deserves no mercy. He may be "tricked,
lied to, sued, deprived of property, injured or destroyed by any means
by any Scientologist."  A California appeals court called
Scientology's treatment of a member "manifestly outrageous," awarding
him $2.5 million for "serious emotional injury," a ruling that was
twice upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, yet the litigant has never
collected. In France, last November, Scientology staff members were
convicted of fraud. And a German court ruled that Scientology used
"inhuman and totalitarian practices." Disaffected Scientologists fear
that this movie will entice believers and reinforce Hubbard's
anti-psychiatry message. Indeed, in the "New York Daily News," John
Travolta acknowledged his mission saying, "If we can't do the things
now that we want to do, what good is the power? Let's try to get the
things done that we believe in.'"
THE REVIEW: In post-apocalyptic 3000, mankind is an endangered
species. Alien Psychlos rule, enslaving the "man-animals" they capture
as they strip the planet of its mineral resources. The villainous Terl
(John Travolta) is the Psychlo Chief of Security - a huge, snarling,
dreadlock'd, fearsome creature. The hero is Jonnie Goodboy Tyler
(Barry Pepper), a human hunter who leaves his mountain hideout,
determined to discover who the demonic Psychlos really are and how to
defeat them. Remember "The Postman"? Well, that's the ambiance - only
there's no Kevin Costner. It's a mythic good guys vs. bad guys story
but Corey Mandell's screenplay, based on Hubbard's book, has so many
sappy cliches and ludicrous, far-fetched loopholes that they incite
unintentional laughter. For example, Tyler is a primitive caveman,
barely able to communicate, yet he discovers a library and is able to
assimilate all its knowledge immediately. He then dupes the Psychlos
into believing he's mining a mountain but substitutes gold bricks from
Ft. Knox which, curiously, the ore-hungry Psychlos have never
discovered. And, finally, Tyler's rebellious cohorts from the
subterranean dungeons jump into Harrier jets - which have not been
serviced in eons - find them full of fuel and fly with precision into
a final battle with the Psychlos. So much for believability. Credit
the stylish special effects involving art/set direction to first-time
feature-film director Roger Christian - that's his background. But the
heavy-handed Christian uses an unusual "center wipe" edit device
between every scene, which is distracting and annoying. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Battlefield Earth" is an awful, grim, tedious
2. "Please, I made a mistake," pleads Forest Whitaker, Travolta's
henchman. But he's shown no mercy, nor is the audience . As for the
allegation that this boring movie will recruit youth - I doubt it!

Running Time: 117 minutes 
Battlefield Earth is the worst film of 2000, and I guarantee you that
nothing else this year will even come close.  In fact, I'll be surprised
if I see anything this bad in the next TEN years. 
Based on the novel by Scientology guru L. Ron Hubbard, Battlefield Earth
begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information.  It's
the year 3000, and an alien race called the Psychlos (which sounds like
a tag team of Mexican wrestlers) conquered our planet in nine minutes. 
Ok, we are all of 10 seconds in and I have a zillion questions racing
through my mind.  When were we conquered?  The audience is led to
believe that this happened about 1,000 years earlier, and if that is the
case then we're going to get into a whole BUNCH of problems later (trust
me... keep reading).  Also, why don't we get to see Earth get
conquered?  How the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not
deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film? 
Humans now live as cavemen or slave labor, and for the film's first act
we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of Denver, Colorado. 
They grunt and groan and babble about monsters.  So, when the Psychlos
conquered Earth, were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn
babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills?  None of these
characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered (whenever
that was).  This is definitely NOT the way to start an action/sci-fi
film. 
One of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across
what he thinks is a monster, and he begins to fight it.  The "monster"
turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course.  He turns
around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course, with
some shrubs growing over them.  So, in 1,000 years this stupid little
golf course has stood the test of time, with only a few weeds growing
over it? 
Anyway, some of the humans are captured by the Psychlos led by Terl
(John Travolta) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a
recently discovered gold deposit.  The cavemen (led by Barry Pepper) are
forced to do their bidding or whatever, but eventually they gain the
upper hand and reclaim the planet, or something.  So these cavemen are
able to do what Earth failed to do 1,000 years earlier?  And, we're
supposed to believe that Earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group
of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen? 
One of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of
abandoned Air Force jets and using them to fight the Psychlos.  So jets
left unattended for 1,000 years are still able to fly?  Please, if I
leave my car unattended for two weeks I have to replace every fluid and
hose under the hood.  Why did the Psychlos leave jets around anyway? 
Shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their
massive nine minute campaign against us? 
The Psychlos refer to humans as "man animals" but yet dogs are still
"dogs".  Why aren't they "dog animals"?  The Psychlos are after mining
Earth's precious resources, but for 1,000 years are unaware of Fort
Knox?  Why do I even care at this point? 
I'm a fan of Travolta's and I'm glad to see he's back on the A-List in
Hollywood (despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing
dreck like Michael and Phenomenon).  But how did he possibly think this
was a good movie?  And how did he think he was giving a good performance
here?  He's more than capable of making a menacing villain (see Broken
Arrow and Face/Off) but whenever his character came on screen I couldn't
hold back my laughter.  Now despite the different facial features
members of this alien race seem to have, Travolta just looks like
Travolta.  All of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy
bones on their face, but Travolta just has a goatee.  Also, Travolta's
acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly
whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world.  Ooooo, scary
villain.  As a producer he should know better and as an actor he should
DEFINITELY know better. 
You can make a dumb but good sci-fi film (I love Independence Day for
example), but there is absolutely NOTHING entertaining about Battlefield
Earth.  I did everything I possibly could to stay awake during the
screening... I cleaned my glasses, walked around the theater, made a
grocery list, chose my lottery numbers for the week, replayed Super Bowl
XXV in my head (with commercials)... and still was compelled to
scrutinize the insides of my eyelids. 
By the time we actually reach the year 3000, people should still be
avoiding this film.  Folks, save your cash.. don't go see it, don't rent
it, and don't buy it.  You'd be more entertained by taking the money
you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind, watching it
sail away (hell, send it to us here at The Jacksonville Film Journal...
we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money).  Unless of course
you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of Barry Pepper
running, which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie. 
That, and a headache. 
[Editor's Note: For some reason though, the day after my screening I
converted to Scientology.  I'm not sure why... something just made me
feel compelled make the choice.]

"Battlefield Earth" is the best comedy of the year. It has to be. The
other prospect is just too horrifying to consider.
Bad Movie Syndrome struck me again, so after witnessing how much
"Battlefield Earth" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical
and popular circles, I felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster
first-hand.  Is it as bad as advertised? Oh yes, very much so. The
plot is incomprehensible. The acting is atrocious. The special effects
are mediocre.  The action is dull. The implausibilities are
legion. The dialogue is cringe-inducing. The whole package is funny
when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be
funny. I don't even want to continue reviewing this movie; I'd like to
purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible, but you probably
want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory, so here it is:
The premise is basically a rip-off of "Planet of the Apes," only minus
the apes and philosophical discussion, and plus a race of evil aliens
from the planet Psychlo. The year is 3000, the Psychlos have conquered
Earth, and the human population has been enslaved. Only a handful of
humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens; they live
out their lives in fear. One man, Johnny Goodboy (I know, I know)
Tyler (Barry Pepper), ventures to the outworld and is captured by the
Psychlos. There he confronts the Psychlo head of security: a big,
ugly, Klingon-looking creature called Terl (John Travolta). Pressed
into slavery, Johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet
back. Meanwhile, Terl is faced with his own problems: He has recently
learned that he's stuck living on Earth (which he hates) for the rest
of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big
man's daughter. He decides to give Johnny knowledge of the Psychlo
language and technology (this is where the plot gets ridiculous . . .)
so the "man-animal" can lead a mining expedition into places the
Psychlos can't go. Terl then plans to keep the mined gold for
himself. Of course, his plan doesn't work.
So many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin? How about with
Travolta, whose Hollywood clout brought about this, the cinematic
version of Scientology guru L. Ron Hubbard's sci-fi novel? Early
previews for "Battlefield Earth," with constant shots of a
makeup-laden Travolta cackling like Lex Luthor, had me (and several
audience members) remarking, "What the hell is Travolta thinking?" The
movie did nothing to stem such remarks.  All that ridiculous cackling
he did in the trailers is in full force here: Terl cackles after
nearly every line, and so does every other Psychlo. Of course, this
makes every scene hilariously overwrought, no more so than when the
script clumsily stumbles into political commentary. The Psychlos are
probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate America, but
CEOs generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to
their employees. ("You were going to be promoted -- but now you're
not!  Fwahahahahahahahaha!!!!!")
It's no big surprise Terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot. He
breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book. He underestimates
his enemies, assuming he'll win just because he's smarter. (He uses
the word "leverage" like some sort of Scientologist mantra.) Not
content to go the James Bond villain route of explaining his plans to
the hero, he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all
the Psychlos' language and technology. (Why this machine is even
around in the first place is beyond me.) He then appears shocked that
Johnny points a gun at him. No wonder this guy never got his
promotion.
The plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention. Why do the
Psychlos build an Earth base in which both they and the human slaves
must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive? How come the
Psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of Fort
Knox are wide open? How in the world did all those fighter jets
survive sitting in a hangar for 1,000 years? And how do all these
previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly? There's a
whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "Battlefield Earth."
Bring a scorecard to track the plot holes.
Director Roger Christian shoots "Battlefield Earth" in the most
distracting way possible, tilting nearly every shot sideways for no
discernible reason.  All the characters appear to be standing on the
walls, and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt
your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue. The action
sequences are atrociously edited, every one turned into an endless
slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement. Are these
things really so hard to construct? My respect for supposed
"lightweight" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after
witnessing in "Battlefield Earth" how badly an action sequence can be
shot.
This movie is an absolute headache. It's not just the shot selection
and editing; the movie, quite frankly, makes no sense. For most of
"Battlefield Earth's" running time, I just didn't know what was
happening. It didn't have anything to do with me finding the events
stupid or illogical (though they certainly are) -- I really had no
idea what the hell was going on. When I pieced the plot together
later, it didn't look any better. Here's how much of a disaster this
is: "Battlefield Earth" is already the worst movie of the year, and
it's going to take something really, really inept to top it.  The only
thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be
suckered into joining the Church of Scientology because of it. In
fact, I'd think that Hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves
from this bomb as fast as possible.
That'll teach me to give into Bad Movie Syndrome again.

Every once in a while, a film comes along that causes me to disregard all of 
my writing skills because, when truth be told, just thinking about it seems 
to notably decrease my IQ. There is no way to be intelligent when discussing 
a movie so repugnantly atrocious and unintelligible as "Battlefield Earth," 
reportedly John Travolta's dream project for ten years and based on the cult 
sci-fi novel by L. Ron Hubbard. Incompetent in every way possible, it is a 
collision course of non-ideas, zero-dimensional characters, shoddy special 
effects, blase performances, and a complete disregard for anything that could 
possibly make any kind of sense to a human being watching such an 
embarrassment. 
The plot is fairly incomprehensible, but it goes something like this: Set in 
the year 3000, when "man is an endangered species" on Earth, a 9-foot-tall 
alien race known as the Psychlos have wiped out almost all human existence, 
with only a minority of earthlings left to do the Psychlos' bidding. Jonny 
Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, and yes, that's his character's real name) is 
captured by the Psychlos, headed by Terl (John Travolta) and his henchman 
(Forest Whitaker), and sent to Ft. Knox to steal all of the gold that has 
been locked up in a vault for the last one-thousand years. I think that's 
some of the plot; I can't be too sure.
Thinking back on "Battlefield Earth," the movie is a giant, 2-hour haze, not 
only because I was struggling to keep focus on the film and not drift into 
slumber for the middle section, but because the picture is a jumble of 
already bad ideas that were made far, far worse when actually translated to 
film, under the phenomenally inauspicious helm of director Roger Christian. 
There are no characters to care about (or even get to know), the villains are 
disposable and unthreatening, and the action sequences about as exciting as 
the entirety of 1982's "My Dinner With Andre." Let's not forget the laughable 
matte paintings, which looked more realistic in 1939's "The Wizard of Oz." Or 
the screen wipes that, without fail, were used as the transition from each 
scene to the next, a 'la "Star Wars," ad nausea.
Prior to its release, John Travolta set off on a countrywide promotional tour 
to support this film, but my question is, had he even seen the finished 
product? Was he really there when filming was underway, or was that his evil 
doppleganger, out to sabotage his career a second time? You'd have to see 
"Battlefield Earth" to believe it, but don't, under any circumstances, see 
it. Some movies have the quality of being so bad they are entertaining. 
"Battlefield Earth," on the other hand, is so bad it's depressing. I would 
never throw around such words lightly, but on the evidence presented here, it 
may very well be one of the worst motion pictures I have ever had the 
misfortune of sitting through. A disaster of epic proportions!

I've assigned no star rating to John Travolta's "Battlefield Earth"
because, frankly, I'm unsure how many stars to give a film that is so
bad that it's good. In general, I find the practice of championing lousy
movies to be distasteful. Mocking the efforts of others is snide, and
besides, there are plenty of quality films dying on the vine for lack of
a receptive audience.
Every so often a movie comes along that is so overwrought, overacted and
overwhelmingly inept that it must be seen to be believed. Glorious
disasters like "Valley of the Dolls," "Mommie Dearest," "Road House" and
"Showgirls." And now comes "Battlefield Earth," the newest entry to the
Grade Z Hall of Fame.
Travolta optioned the source novel in 1983, and has been trying to get
the 1000 page opus by his mentor, L. Ron Hubbard, onto the big screen
ever since. Originally, he dreamed of starring as the young hero, but as
the years passed and his waistline thickened, Travolta (who also
co-produced the film) opted to play the villain instead.
The story is set in the year 3000; nearly a millennium after the
Psychlos, a supremely arrogant alien race, wiped out most of humanity.
As security chief Terl (Travolta) graciously explains, "When we attacked
your planet... all your soldiers and all their advanced technology, you
only put up a measly nine-minute fight. This is why Man is an endangered
species!" From domed installations, the Psychlos force the surviving
"man-animals" to mine for gold.
The remnants of our species are primitives, many of whom consider the
Psychlos to be vengeful gods. When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper,
the sharpshooter from "Saving Private Ryan") dares to leave his people
in the hills to go exploring, he is quickly captured by the aliens and
comes face to face with Mr. Psychlo himself. Terl, enraged after being
passed over for promotion, uses Jonnie as a pawn in an elaborate scheme
to regain the power he feels he deserves. But Jonnie has plans of his
own. Assembling a ragtag (is there any other kind?) team of patriots, he
intends to drive the Psychlos off the planet, by any means necessary.
The plot is serviceable; it's the execution that makes "Battlefield
Earth" such a joke. The filmmakers are so determined to make viewers
realize they are watching an !!EPIC!! that they turn the production into
a gigantic block of cheese.
>From the opening scenes, which employ a "Beastmaster" motif, Elia
Cmiral's "majestic" score bludgeons the audience with thunderous noise.
If one of the noble human savages even raises an arm, you can count on a
pounding kettledrum or a fanfare to accompany the movement.
The acting matches the music. Barry Pepper adopts a stilted Mid Atlantic
accent, the kind community theater actors use when they play royalty.
Sincere to a fault, his strained delivery suggests constipation rather
than heroism. Perhaps the strain was from trying to keep a straight face
while spouting lines like "We're gonna destroy their home world of
course, we'll need some extra supplies for that."
Pepper is a master of subtlety compared to Travolta, who gives a
performance that would make William Shatner wince. Decked out like the
bastard son of a Klingon and Gene Simmons, the dreadlocked Travolta
crinkles his fingers while hissing, snarling and overenunciating
absurdly, punctuating sentences like "Once we finish mining-out this
miserable little planet, let's do the Universe a favor: Let's
exterminate the life from it!" with maniacal laughter. He also swears a
lot, mostly using peculiar variants of the word "crap."
The Psychlos are supposed to be overconfident fools who fatally
underestimate humanity ("A man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo,"
cackles Terl, "that'll be the day!"), and Travolta gets that part right.
But they're also supposed to be frightening, and these boobs in KISS
boots are anything but. As Terl's underling, Ker, Forest Whitaker
(looking extremely uncomfortable in freaky contact lens) is a bit less
embarrassing than Travolta, though he has his share of cringe-worthy
moments. Kelly Preston, Mrs. Travolta, also appears briefly, just long
enough to lasciviously waggle her mega-long CGI tongue.
As for the mechanics of the "man-animal" revolt, suffice to say the plot
has more holes than a tattooist's ears. Oh sure, the Psychlos took Earth
in nine minutes, but the savages have an edge because, hey, they're
spunky. Luckily for them, aircraft that has sat untouched for nearly a
thousand years still works. And if you thought the resolution of
"Independence Day" was ridiculous, wait until you get a load of the
finale here.
Visually, the film is a muddy pastiche of images and set pieces from
other sci-fi films, ripping off everything from "Planet of the Apes" to
"The Matrix." Adding to the absurdity is Director Roger Christian's
attempt to weird things up by repeatedly shooting scenes at an angle, ŕ
la "The Twilight Zone."
If you think this all sounds horrific, trust me  I've barely scraped
the surface. "Battlefield Earth" is an absolute disaster and a crapload
of campy fun. The icing on the cheesecake is Travolta's assurance that
there will positively be a sequel. Jeepers, I can hardly wait!

We've seen a lot of alien invasion movies come out over the past few years,
but when's the last time we saw a really cool movie about aliens actually
running our planet? Not since the original PLANET OF THE APES has such an
interesting premise been given such major attention, as John Travolta takes
the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's famous sci-fi novel and turns it into
this summer's first big science-fiction popcorn ride.
PLOT:
It is the year 3000, and our planet is being manhandled by evil Psychlos
alien beings. Security chief Terl is the meanest sonnova-bitch of them all,
ruling with his arrogance, power and blackmailing skills. It isn't until a
peasant man who goes by the name of Jonnie Goodboy Tyler takes a stand that
the few surviving humans decide to rally in the hopes of defeating their
gigantic oppressors.
CRITIQUE:
Fun cheese. Despite starting off like a bad Star Trek episode, this film
eventually graduates to a higher level with great special effects, some
really slick bad-ass aliens, an intriguing premise and a good flow of loud,
campy fun. Don't bother seeing this movie if you're expecting a film similar
in nature to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. This one definitely asks that you bring
along a bag of farfetchedness, with many of your likely questions relating
to the plausibility of a handful of human beings fighting an entire alien
race. But if you consider the pure arrogance of the Psychlos, and the way in
which they underestimate and even misdiagnose many of the humans, it becomes
a much easier pill of reasoning to swallow. I personally had very few issues
with the story, which I found to be interesting and fast-paced enough to
keep me entertained.
I had an initial problem with the alien beings, their accents and their
exaggerated laughs, but all that seemed to disappear about 20 minutes into
the film, as I got more and more used to their world. I also loved the fact
that the aliens were some real bad muthas! I mean, these guys were nasty
boogers! I dug on them completely, and was even rooting for them to stomp
our dumb human asses...! Overall, the movie played like a 2-hour sci-fi
comic book with many a loud bang, an overly obtrusive score, great scene
transitions and some of the better special effects of the year. You truly
felt like this was the end of the world as we knew it, and I certainly
didn't notice any part of my fair city of Montreal in any of the proceedings
(the film was shot on location here). This film is not to be taken too
seriously, with many melodramatic human moments sappy as hell (one scene
seemed like a carbon copy of Mel Gibson's infamous BRAVEHEART sequence
"...fight for our freedom!). And I also could have done without the umpteen
slo-mo shots of Barry Pepper running down Matrix-like hallways, but in the
end, the film was fast, furious and just a good ol' time at the theatres.
Now whether or not you end up liking the film, I think we can all agree that
this is certainly an admirable turn for Travolta. Both he and Whitaker chew
right into their dirty, grungy roles and truly become these unconscionable
alien beings. So if you're looking for a cool, mindless, special-effect
laden film starring a couple of bad muthas, this puppy is made prime for
you. This movie is loud, sorta campy, over-the-top and certainly not
super-tight in narrative. But overall, the energy of the film is slated to
"fun" and the last 20 minutes are especially wild. So don't take it all so
seriously and enjoy the ride!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
I was lucky enough to meet and interview John Travolta for this film
(http://www.joblo.com/travolta1.htm), and here are a few tidbits from that
meeting:
1) Other than the fact that L. Ron Hubbard wrote the novel on which this
movie is based and is known as the founder of Scientology, there is nothing
in the film which connects the two.
2) A sequel for this film is already slated to begin production in Montreal,
most likely next year.
3) John is interested in directing one day, although it will probably be in
a limited capacity, and definitely about something personal, most likely an
adaptation of his own book, "Propellor One-Way Night Coach".
John Travolta's wife, actress Kelly Preston, makes an appearance in this
film as one of the female aliens named Chirk. She's the one with the
extra-long tongue swirling about.
Barry Pepper was born in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. He had a
few small roles in bigger films over the past few years, including parts in
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, ENEMY OF THE STATE and THE GREEN MILE. Most of this
film was shot on location in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Director Roger Christian was art director on the 1979 movie ALIEN, and set
decorator on the 1977 sci-fi classic STAR WARS.
The film is actually based on the first 500 pages of the novel, with a few
moments from the second part of the book also thrown in.

In BATTLEFIELD EARTH, grown men get to dress up like Klingons having bad
hair days, while uttering some of the silliest dialog this side of a bad
1950s sci-fi flick.  The theater should be required to have signs
warning customers: "Ye who enter in must be prepared to completely
suspend disbelief."  Although the film has a few nice, but too dark,
special effects, the only reason to see the it is as a guilty pleasure,
so you can laugh at John Travolta in an embarrassingly bad performance.
His character laughs a lot, too - a hearty and silly "Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha,"
like a busted toy action figure whose voice chip is stuck in a loop.
Directed confusingly by Roger Christian (MASTERMINDS) and adapted for
the screen by first-timer Corey Mandell, the film is based, as most
people know, on the science fiction novel of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder
of the Church of Scientology.  One can only hope the book was more
intelligent than it is portrayed on the screen.
Earth, we learn, in 3000 AD will look a lot like 3000 BC, thanks to our
having lost a 9-minute war with the Psychlos, an alien race who has no
respect for "man animals" or our "puny sized planet."  Earthlings have
been reduced to cavemen, who worship the stars in the heavens as gods.
In an over-the-top performance, John Travolta plays Terl, the Psychlos'
security chief for earth and the story's main villain.  He is a
slimeball who is hated by man animals and  other Psychlos, as well.
(You'll be forced to stare at the Psychlos' ugly pusses and dirty teeth
in endless close-ups until you're ready to surrender.)  Even Terl's
superiors hate him.  "Look up," a visiting mucky-muck tells him.  "One
day, you'll die.  And when you end up in hell, it'll be a step up from
this planet."  Poor earth, which is mainly in ruins, gets dissed a lot
in the movie.
The cinematography uses various shades of a slimy blue-green.  The
picture tries hard to look gross and succeeds.  Just to make sure that
no one is surreptitiously having a good time, there are some raw rat
eating scenes tossed in to spice up the viewing.
Against this race of oppressors, a hero rises up to smite them down.  He
is Jonnie (Barry Pepper), a man animal whom Terl foolishly hooks up to
the Psychlos' learning machine.  The Psychlos, who act like imbeciles,
think man animals are so stupid that they can't even be taught how to
operate simple machinery and are good only for manual labor.
Try to count the number of films that the movie borrows from liberally.
First and foremost is STAR WARS, but others include BUTCH CASSIDY AND
THE SUNDANCE KID, STAR TREK, BRAVEHEART, BLADE RUNNER, PLANET OF THE
APES, MAD MAX and Wagner's "The Ring" series of operas.  But whereas the
originals are engrossing, BATTLEFIELD EARTH is long and tedious.
As a guilty pleasure, nothing is better than BATTLEFIELD EARTH's totally
preposterous concluding segment.  As the cavemen keep saying "Piece of
cake," they become overnight experts in everything from advanced fighter
pilot skills to nuclear engineering.  Wow, can those guys ever crack a
book.  All of that time in the cave must have softened their brains into
veritable cranial sponges for knowledge, as they absorb facts at light
speed.
Whatever you do, try not to laugh.  It may spoil the effect for those
around you.  They may be buying the story, hook, line and stinker -- I
mean sinker.
BATTLEFIELD EARTH runs a long 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and
would be acceptable for teenagers.  Given the movie's dark intensity,
I'd be careful about taking kids under 13.

John Travolta and Forest Whitaker do some Hollywood slumming in this
tenement of a sci-fi thriller.
You know, I do my best to keep from saying a film is "bad." A good teacher
finds little use in value-judging a report by a student. There are so many
criteria that we can "objectively" talk about -- strong here, weak there
etc. But this is just one of those scripts that you know the student must
have whipped out five minutes before class.
I'm really surprised with all the writing talent available in this town,
that no one said "Hey, this is just a bad script."
And the only reason I can think that Travolta and Whitaker did it was to
spoof themselves; relax in the lowest-of-brow movies to wind down from a
thick script or something. Perhaps it was a dare? Maybe they lost a bet?
Of course, they're decent, even the lead hero is good - as good as you can
possibly be with nearly nothing verbally to work with (in fact at times
nothing would have been better said). The acting is not the problem. Even
the premise is decent ... it's the contrived conflicts, advancements and
worst of all the dialogue of this film that makes one embarrassed to be a
lover of movies.
Basically, it's the year 3000, an ugly group of corrupt back-stabbing aliens
(the Psychlo's) have wiped out nearly all Earthlings and the remaining few
are used as slaves to mine gold for their home planet (I'm not sure why gold
is valuable to aliens). Until ... one of those slaves decides to fight for
... you guessed it "Freedom!"
Introductory dialogue is expository and would have been better left to "Star
Wars" type text preface. The look of the film is a bit too digital. Our hero
gets shot through a series of glass windows in shattering slow-mo - and yet,
it's just not thrilling.
Travolta (lead Psychlo) in an effort to better control the humans explains,
"We'll let it think it's escaped, just to see what food it likes best..." as
if the monopoly on oxygen wasn't enough to motivate "it". But, the scheme
gets even more ridiculous, instead of killing this rebel human (who had
already vaporized a couple of Psychlo guards) Travolta teaches it to speak
Psychlo and then gives it access to a library of knowledge. (Yeah, that
should teach it to behave!)
Of course, now armed with brains, brawn and revolutionary fervor, the lead
human proclaims to the mass of human slaves waving rocks and sticks, "We're
going to blow up their home planet ... of course, we'll need some extra
supplies." The delivery of this line was met with a robust round of chuckles
from the audience.
But, alas, there is rarely a film that has nothing at all redeeming to
offer. So due, here are a few kudos to those things well done: Shot of hero
from bottom cage of craft as it lifts off ground is strong and visually
stirring! In fact, the alien transport units were created and manipulated
well - they look very good on screen. Language nuances were handled nicely.
To the Psychlo's the chattering of humans sounded like "Ooga ooga"
animalistic or fraternal (in the college sense of the word). While the
Psychlo utterances warp into English so that we, the audience can understand
them (w/o subtitles). Lastly, ten-year-olds may very well enjoy this film.

My thesaurus lists several synonyms for the word `dumb,' but I've
crossed them all out and printed just two words in their place:
"Battlefield Earth."  This film adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's
best-selling 1982 sci-fi book is just as silly as the religion he
created, and it probably never would have been made if it weren't for
the constant lobbying by the film's star/producer (and raging
Scientologist) John Travolta.
Comparisons to Planet of the Apes will be inevitable, but Earth comes
off as more of an ill-conceived cross between the 1984 Brat Pack film
Red Dawn and Styx's concept album `Killroy Was Here.'  It's a
heavy-handed good-versus-evil story that is poorly directed, poorly
written, poorly acted and plays like a movie made for 2:00 AM viewing on
basic cable rather than the summer blockbuster season.  The best
description of the film I've seen is as follows: `Give Ed Wood a $100
million budget, and you get Battlefield Earth.'
Earth is set in the year 3000 (it's actually subtitled A Saga of the
Year 3000), where a sadistic alien race from the planet Psychlos has
taken over Earth and wiped out most of its inhabitants.  Terl (Travolta,
The General's Daughter) is the Psychlo Security Director of Earth who,
as the film opens, finds out that his proposed transfer back to Psychlos
has been postponed for several years.  Terl has a sidekick named Ker
(Forest Whitaker, Ghost Dog), who looks like a melange of The Next
Generation's Worf and the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.
Meanwhile, Johnnie (Barry Pepper, The Green Mile), one of Earth's few
remaining humans, decides he's fed up with living in fear of the
Psychlos and rides horseback to what used to be Denver to confront the
aliens head-on.  Johnnie is immediately captured by Terl, who tries to
use the spunky young Earthling to mine gold in an area of the planet
containing radioactive air that is deadly for Psychlos.
What unfolds is a predictably conventional story of the meek inheriting
the Earth  literally.  With a story this unimaginative, you would
expect some decent, over-the-top violence, or at least cutting-edge
special effects, but Earth offers neither.  Instead, the film attempts
to be inventive by shooting every scene off-kilter and using a
completely annoying dissolve from the center of the screen as a
transition between scenes.  Some of Earth's dialogue is bad enough to
induce mock laughter and applause from the audience, MST3K-style.
Travolta is just plain silly in the role he's been waiting his whole
life to play.  His Terl kind of sounds like Stewie on The Family Guy 
another person with an oddly-shaped head and, in a harmlessly evil kind
of way, ambitions beyond his means.  The cackling Terl and his alien
cohorts all look like Coneheads with dreadlocks and disgusting
baked-bean teeth (Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston makes a brief cameo and
has perfect white choppers).  I'd like to comment on the other actors in
the film, but Earth is one of those pictures where you're not sure what
anybody's name is.  And to make matters worse, Earth only covers half of
Hubbard's 1,000-plus page novel.  The filmmakers plan on releasing a
sequel in two years.
Much has and will be said about the similarities between Earth and
Scientology.  Travolta swears one has nothing to do with the other, but
he's as honest with himself as anybody else that's this into their
religion. Scientologists believe that psychiatrists are responsible for
the majority of evil in the world, so it's no coincidence that the bad
guys in the film (and Hubbard's book) are called Psychlos.  I have a lot
more to say about Scientology but won't, as their figureheads have a
tendency to sue people that don't think Hubbard hung the moon.  Some
people have even accused Scientologists of inserting subliminal messages
into Earth.  Don't worry  if they did, I'm sure that I would have liked
it a lot more.  Or, at least, I would have 
cluckcluckcluck.
2:07  PG-13 for sci-fi violence and mild adult situations
