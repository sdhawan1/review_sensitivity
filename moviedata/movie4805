PANIC (director/writer: Henry Bromell; cinematographer: Jeffry Jur; editor:
Lynzee Klingman/Cindy Mollo; cast: William H. Macy (Alex), Donald Sutherland
(Michael), Neve Campbell (Sarah), Tracey Ullman (Martha), John Ritter (Dr. Josh
Parks), Barbara Bain (Deidre), David Dorfman (Sammy), Miguel Sandoval
(Detective); Runtime: 88; Roxie Releasing; 2000) 
A solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir, but one that
comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it
decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind. Alex
(Macy) is an emotionless, mild-mannered man of middle-age, who has a nagging
psychological problem that is making him feel weird. His family doctor suggests
he see a therapist about his midlife crisis. While in the therapist's waiting
room, he strikes up a conversation with an outspoken 23-year-old beautician
named Sarah (Neve), who is waiting to see another therapist. He becomes
strangely attracted to her and feels compelled to see her again. Sarah's private
life is chaotic and much looser than his, as she's attracted to both men and
women. She feels that this married man who has a 6-year-old son, will only use
her for sex and dump her when he has no more need for her body. 
Alex tells the therapist, Dr. Parks (Ritter), that he has two jobs -- a
mail-order business run out of his home and he works for his father (Sutherland)
as a professional hit man: he kills people. He wants to leave the family
business but doesn't know how to. His father trained him at an early age to be
in the murder for hire business by killing squirrels as a child. His
occupational secret is something that only his creepy mother Deidre (Bain) knows
about outside of him and his father. His wife Martha (Ullman) has no clue, while
his precocious son Sammy (Dorfman) is gently handled by him; father and son
spend quality time together talking about such things as infinity. 
The main plot development occurs when his mother gets it out of him that he's
seeing a shrink, and she tells hubby. Since one of the rules of the family
business is to tell no one else what their business is, the father orders his
son's next contract to be Dr. Parks. 
The tension builds for Alex as he wrestles with how to handle dad, how to raise
his son, how to reconcile his already weakened sanity if he kills his shrink,
and how to handle his feelings for Sarah and his wife. 
It's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its
dilemma in such a crisp way. It builds in tension to show how unhappy Alex is
with his bourgeois life and how unhappy Sarah is with her bohemian party
lifestyle. But his dilemma is the greater, as he is drawn out by his therapist
to ask himself questions that he doesn't want to answer but is now forced to. 
What keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by Macy
who ably anchors the film, as he allows us to see who and what he is; and, more
importantly what suffering he is now going through. Sutherland's performance is
devilishly demonic, and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a
very scary character who gets under our skin. Bain's complicity with Sutherland
adds to the psychological trauma of the Macy character. In contrast to the men,
Neve Campbell's performance is loud and reaching. As a character-driven film, it
is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced
screenwriter Henry Bromell. Panic plays like an episode for Homicide does that
has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities. Bromell, the
Homicide cop-show writer, has made a TV cop drama come to life as a B movie that
can't get away from TV's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics.
But, nevertheles, I still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a
brain, a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced
with bitter irony.

Alex (William H. Macy) is a depressed, middle-aged, middle class guy who 
works two jobs.  In the first, working out of his home, he sells "lawn 
ornaments, kitchen gewgaws and sexual aids."  But it is his second job, 
working for his father, Michael (Donald Sutherland), which concerns us.  
Simply put, Alex is a hit man, a contract killer, a cold-blooded 
murderer.
PANIC, by writer/director Henry Bromell, is a crisp tale rather like a 
short story.  The black comedy has a smart, subtle wit and is filmed in 
melancholic shades of blues and greens.  A character study of 
middle-aged angst, the movie could not have had a better lead than by 
Macy.  With his troubled brow and his handsome, big, soulful eyes, he 
speaks volumes without even opening his mouth.  He could be the poster 
boy for middle-aged men everywhere.  Giving another of his empathetic 
performances, he makes his character's pain visceral.  Alex is one lost, 
depressed guy, and his job is perhaps the least of his problems.  
In contrast to his emotionally volatile father, Alex never loses his 
temper.  At home, Alex has an inquisitive, precocious and borderline 
obnoxious 6-year-old boy, Sammy (David Dorfman), and a self-described 
"jealous housewife," Martha (Tracey Ullman).  He goes through the 
motions with them, but his mind is lost in the fog.
Alex, after years of bottling up his anger and his crushing sadness, 
goes to seek the advice of a shrink, Dr. Parks (John Ritter).  At Dr. 
Parks's office, he finally discovers hope -- no, not from the doctor but 
from a 23-year-old patient, Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he meets in the 
waiting room.
Where, if anywhere, Alex and Sarah's relationship will go isn't clear.  
Whether it will ever even evolve past awkward, polite conversation isn't 
at all certain.  Like the rest of the story, their chemistry is sad, 
sweet and poignant.  Sarah is wise beyond her years, fairly amoral and 
emotionally disturbed.  As in many short stories, most of her character 
stays an enigma.  One thing is obvious -- Alex cannot get her out of his 
mind.
We learn more about some of the underlying causes of Alex's mental 
problems.  "Every man has a destiny, Alex.  The trick is in discovering 
it," his father tells him at age 6, as he is being shown his destiny, or 
at least the one that his father has in mind for him.  
Touching, sad and sometimes funny, PANIC is the story of Alex's 
rebellion at what has become his destiny.  The movie's biggest surprise 
is that with an excellent cast, superb acting and an intriguing story, 
almost no one has seen it, since it is getting an absolutely minimal 
theatrical release.  With all of the insipid films that get released 
every week, it is a shame that one with this much merit is being 
ignored. 
PANIC runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated R for language and elements of 
violence and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

'Ever get the feeling that you're dead?' asks Alex (William H. Macy,
"State and Main") at his first appointment with psychologist Dr. Parks
(John Ritter, "Sling Blade").  Alex is severely depressed, probably due
to the family business he's looking to get out of - contract killing.
While he has an amazing relationship with his young son Sammy, 
(David Dorfman, "Bounce") his marriage to Martha (Tracey Ullman) is at
a crossroads when he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) in Dr. Parks' office in
first time writer/director Henry Bromell's "Panic."
"Panic" is one of those heralded little films which played festivals but
is having a difficult time getting theatrical release.  This could be due
to its 'hitman goes to shrink' theme, already covered in "The Sopranos"
and "Analyze This," or it could be due to a niche quirkiness that would appeal
to an audience willing to overlook its flaws.
"Panic" makes mistteps, but also takes some intriguing side roads, 
particularly in its unique familial relationships.  Alex lies in Sammy's
bed every evening and has real conversations with the boy (portrayed as
maybe just a bit too precocious).  Alex' relationship with his own dad
is another matter entirely and is summed up by a flashback of Michael
showing the young Alex how to shoot a squirrel with a Walther PPK - 
something the boy clearly does not wish to do.  Mom Diedre (Barbara Bain, 
TV's "Mission Impossible") acts as a sounding board to Alex' face ('Don't 
tell Martha - I want this kept private' she's informed by a son who confides
in his mother over his wife), yet immediately informs husband Michael of 
Alex's shrink visits because 'I thought you ought to know.'
The romantic angle, which appears to be a focal point of the story, is left 
hung out to dry, however.  Alex is too much the family man to leave Martha
for Sarah and Sarah refuses to be his mistress.  A flashback which shows
how Alex met Martha is far more interesting than anything that happens with
the present day flirtation.
Macy is good as a man torn between his duty to his father and to his son
and really makes you feel the chlostrophobic panic of his situation.  Donald 
Sutherland, in the pivotal role of the ruthless Michael, is simply miscast.  
He's an actor that embodies characters which are patrician, intellectual or
bohemian, but just doesn't work as a crass, ruthless breeder of hitmen.
He does succeed in one scene, where he accompanies Alex's young brother on
his first hit, sending the man off like a kid on a bicycle with training
wheels.  Barbara Bain shows steely nerve as the mom who's more loyal to her
husband's interests than one would expect.  Ullman is totally believable
as Sammy's mom, the woman who intrigued Alex enough to court and wed her,
but is now confused by their marital state.  Neve Campbell isn't given much
to work with to make Sarah anything but symbolic of a midlife crisis.
Dorfman, directed with just a notch more restraint, could have made
Sammy one of the best child portrayals of the year.
Once "Panic" lays its groundwork, it's fairly easy to predict where it's
going, yet it has enough unique grace notes to make it a worthwhile curiousity.
Keep an eye on filmmaker Bromwell.

   How many times have you heard this conversation today?
   Five times?  Ten?  Twenty?  In a book she published some
years back, Sisela Bork stated that the average American lies
about twenty time a day.  If so, this sort of conversation must
be the most common practice.  In fact I've seen people at the
dentist's waiting for a root canal who are asked by the
receptionist, "How are you today?"  The answer?  You
guessed it.  Alex (William H. Macy) is so not-OK in Henry
Bromell's "Panic," that even when he sits on the couch for
the first time with his psychotherapist he says "I'm OK." 
Truth to tell he's not OK, and neither are his parents Michael
(Donald Sutherland) and Deidre (Barbara Bain), his
delightfully precocious six-year-old child Sammy (David
Dorfman), his wife Martha (Tracey Ullman), his would-be girl
friend Sarah (Neve Campbell), and in a more physical sense
his shrink (John Ritter).  The picture itself is not simply OK: It
approaches the dimensions of a small masterpiece with Henry
Bromell's taut, serpentine script at several points allowing
Bill Macy to sound like a character out of David Mamet (for
which Macy's is the expert), exquisite ensemble acting
particularly by Macy and by the enchanting little David
Dorfman, and Brian Tyler's unobtrusive soundtrack.  Artisan's
panic is Roxie's catch: the distinguished studio that's given us
such cutting edge films as "The Blair Witch Project," "Pi,"
"Requiem for a Dream," "The Buena Vista Club," and "Cecil
B. Demented," passed up a terrific opportunity by heeding the
reaction of a focus group that must have been having a bad
day and dropping the project.  Picked up by Roxie, "Panic"
has already played on Cinemax cable back in August and
should enjoy a solid release this year on the big screen.
   Speaking of cable, "Panic" summons up recent memories
of the hit HBO show "The Sopranos," which featured its
principal character Tony Soprano as a guy who, like Macy's
Alex, must come to grips with a mid-life crisis.  But unlike
Soprano, Alex does tell his therapist about the family
business--which leads to a tense series of dangerous
confrontations with the head doctor and forces the patient to
make a dramatic existential decision.  "Panic" focuses on the
man who is a diffident, even reluctant killer, trained by his
father Michael from an early age to enter the family's sordid
business.  Michael is a hit man, understandably depressed
from the time that his dad showed him a gun for the first time
and coaxed him to shoot a squirrel.  Giving the young man
an opportunity for a human kill when Alex turns sixteen,
Michael rewards the boy with a spirited pat on the back and a
slice of the family affluence secured by a run of contracts
from people unwilling to dirty their own hands with murder. 
When the chronically despondent Alex has his first session
with the doctor, he finds that he comes alive not so much
during his $125-an-hour meeting on the coach but from a
bizarre conversation with a 23-year-old hairdresser, Sarah
(Neve Campbell), who is a patient of another therapist in the
same suite of offices.  When his wife Martha gets
confirmation of her husband's growing relationship with the
young woman, a family crisis develops that pushes Michael
into effecting a decisive change in his life.
   Roger Ebert, who in a discussion of the movie with guest
critic Joyce Kulhawk last June called this stunning movie "too
smart" to be released nationally, will get his wish for more
exposure when "Panic" opens on the big screen this year.  A
psychological suspense thriller of the first order, "Panic"
achieves what a plethora of gangster films never approaches:
a human-scale portrayal of the psyches of the mobsters, one
which demonstrates that not all mercenaries are happy with
their sordid work.  While Macy is in virtually every scene,
Bromell does a remarkable job of evoking a team spirit with
his ensemble of crackerjack actors.  Neve Campbell, known
to teens for her roles in mock-horror flicks, never looked
better nor has she ever been given dialogue more crackling
than Bromell's.  Sharp-tongued to hide her vunerabilities,
Campbell's Sarah delivers repeated blows to Alex's ego while
affording the disturbed killer an opportunity for redemption. 
As Martha, Tracey Ullman, playing against type as a
melancholy housewife, provides a striking, dishwater contrast
to Sarah's vibrant sexuality, while the fifty-year-old Bill Macy--
principally a stage actor who has had to wait quite a while
before the film industry would give him major roles--furnishes
his audience with a moving, resourceful performance as a
murderer who is himself among the walking wounded.
Rated R.  Running time: 88 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

`Do you ever get the feeling you're dead?'  That's the first line in
Henry Bromell's Panic, and it's uttered by an upper-middle-class man in
the throes of a midlife crisis.  Sounds a little like the beginning of
American Beauty, eh?  If you think that's bad, wait until you learn that
the character is also a killer-for-hire who visits a shrink.  Now
there's something we haven't seen in a while.
Thankfully, Panic isn't just a derivative knockoff of Beauty or the
whole shrink/hitman thing from Analyze This and The Sopranos.  While the
film's characters are pretty decently fleshed out, and its story follows
a fairly predictable trajectory, Panic's real drawing card is its
fantastic cast.  Each turns in great performances that keep the film
interesting and fresh, despite the fact its content was lifted from the
day-old rack at the Hollywood Food Market.
William H. Macy (State and Main) plays Alex, unhappy husband to Martha
(Tracey Ullman, Small Time Crooks) and father to precocious six-year-old
Sammy (David Dorfman, Bounce).  Alex has two jobs  one running a
moderately successful mail-order business from his home, and the other
as a contract killer for his father (Donald Sutherland, Space Cowboys).
It's the latter that lands him on the couch of Dr. Josh Parks (John
Ritter, Felicity).
Alex tells Dr. Parks about meeting a girl named Sarah (Neve Campbell,
Scream 3) who doesn't make him feel dead.  Coincidentally, he met Sarah
while waiting in Dr. Parks' waiting room (never a good place to pick up
women, if you ask me).  Alex explains that he was instantly smitten with
Sarah, and that the no-nonsense bisexual eventually fell in love with
his wonderfully sad eyes.
Dr. Parks bolsters Alex's confidence to stand up to his overbearing
father, who simply refuses to believe that his only son wants to quit
the family business.  When Alex receives a photograph of his next
target, it sends him reeling.  His life is truly at a crossroads.  Does
he choose his supportive wife, or the hot manic chick?  Mail-order or
contract killing?  Wouldn't we all like to have choices like these to
make?
Bromell, an executive producer for Northern Exposure and Homicide, makes
his feature-film writing and directorial debuts with Panic, with the
latter easily outclassing the former.  He cleverly uses flashbacks to a
series of firsts in Alex's life (first encounters with Martha, Dr. Parks
and Sarah, first firearms lesson from his father, first professional
hit) to bring us into the character's life.  The scenes featuring Alex
and little Sammy are touching and done rather well.
With this role, Campbell displays talent we haven't seen since the first
two seasons of Party of Five.  It's really nice to see Ullman doing
something where I don't want to choke the shit out of her (read:  not
playing multiple, unfunny characters), and what can you say about Macy?
He turns in another typically incredible performance as Alex  a bit of
a cross between his `Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith from Magnolia and Jerry
Lundegaard from Fargo.

Alex (William H. Macy) needs to see a shrink. He's facing a mid-life
crisis, is unhappy with his marriage and worried about his son. He also
wants to leave the family business. Alex is a hit man with a conscience and
wants out in "Panic."
When Alex first goes to see Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) he meets Sarah
(Neve Campbell), a pretty, severely neurotic young woman. They take an
immediate liking to each other and a tentative romance begins to blossom.
The reason Alex is seeing the doc in the first place is because of his
deep-seated feelings of guilt over his troubled marriage and deadly career.
When he meets Sarah, his problems are compounded, not improved, and Alex
continues an inexorable downward spiral.
William H. Macy is one of my favorite character actors and there are few
times he misses in a performance. In "Panic" he portrays the angst-ridden
Alex as a truly troubled man who doesn't want to make waves for his
family's murder-for-hire business but wants, desperately, out. His work
problems affect his marriage, too, as he grows distant from his loyal wife,
Martha (Tracey Ullman). His only solace is the time he spends with son,
gaining strength from the little boy's unconditional love for his dad.
Macy's character study of Alex overshadows the rest of the players
markedly. Donald Sutherland comes across not as a high powered,
mob-connected businessman whose commodity is murder but as a childish creep
who has no humanity - he even forces his grandson to gun down a squirrel.
Tracey Ullman has the thankless wife role, while John Ritter is merely an
object for the hit-man story to rest upon. Neve Campbell, as Sarah, has
nowhere to take her troubled character. For the most part, she has to go
one-on-one with  Alex or her shrink. She doesn't get the opportunity to
break out of her shell, acting only as a conscience for her would be lover.
Only Barbara Bain (remember her in the "Mission: Impossible" TV series?)
fares well as Alex's mother. She gets the chance to put a ruthless spin on
her outwardly kindly wife and mother, Deidre, who, in fact, brooks no
discontent from her son when he asks to get out of the killing business.
Newcomer writer/director Henry Bromwell joins the pantheon of
mobster-shrink flicks that began with TV's "The Sopranos" and the
DeNiro/Crystal movie "Analyze This." It's an interesting idea that could
have used a more experienced hand at the helm. The premise of a mob member
seeing a shrink about his guilt for his crimes should get some screen
mileage, but it falls flat in "Panic." I give it a C-.
