Susan Granger's review of "THE LAST CASTLE" (DreamWorks)

Oscar alert! This high-tension military prison drama is the first real contender
of the Fall season. The story begins as idolized but court-martialed three-star
Army General Irwin (Robert Redford) is delivered in handcuffs to a
maximum-security military prison run by Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini) whose
stunned reaction is: "They should be naming a base after the man, not sending
him here." A proud West Point graduate who pled guilty to disobeying a direct
order, Irwin is resigned to spending time incarcerated in the stockade, telling
fellow inmates: "I'm not fighting anyone for anything any more." But he's soon
appalled by the brutal, sadistic manipulative techniques used by the psychotic,
power-mad Colonel. "We are soldiers - and no one can take that away from us," he
finally declares, igniting guerrilla warfare against injustice within the penal
system, culminating in redemption and the triumph of the human spirit.
Screenwriters David Scarpa and Graham Yost set up a classic dramatic
confrontation over leadership since the plight of the protagonist is only as
tough as the antagonist makes it. Director Ron Lurie infuses the film with a
resonating tension, pitting Robert Redford, as the intense, charismatic hero
whose quiet, understated dignity transforms his desperate, dispirited cohorts
into defiant yet disciplined soldiers, against James Gandolfini, who carries the
warden to the brink of hardcore villainy with the will and ability to kill as
many prisoners as necessary to retain control. Mark Ruffalo scores as an
opportunistic bookie, Clifton Collins Jr. as an abused inmate, and Delroy Lindo
as Irwin's former colleague. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Last
Castle" is a powerful 10. It's compelling, crowd-pleasing escapist entertainment
with a patriotic, flag-waving finale.

People looking for escapist fun at the theatre may be polarized by Rod
Lurie's The Last Castle.  While it doesn't deal with terrorism and isn't set
in New York City, the film does feature a scene where a helicopter is
hijacked and used to plow into a building in order to kill a guy who's just
doing his job.  And that's not even counting the patriotic, flag-waving
(literally) finale.
In the film, Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer) plays a three-star U.S.
Army General named Irwin, who, after pleading guilty to a crime, is shipped
off to a maximum-security military prison run by Colonel Winter (James
Gandolfini, The Mexican).  Although we don't know anything about his
background, it is assumed Irwin is some kind of military hero, on account of
Winter being all geeked up about his impending arrival.  The other inmates
don't feel quite the same way, as some place bets with the prison bookie
(Mark Ruffalo, You Can Count on Me) about potential suicide attempts.
The two men butt heads almost immediately, launching a
who's-got-a-bigger-cock battle for control of the prison (it's called The
Castle, by the way).  Winter has fun using the inmates as pawns and watches
it all from a big third-story window like a kid with an ant farm, while
Irwin quickly earns the respect of his peers in a very silly scene that
involves moving a large pile of heavy rocks (it probably should have been
set to Aretha Franklin's "Respect").  Winter looks down from on high,
proudly declaring, "He's playing soldier," as he surveys Irwin from an
office filled with shiny war toys he has collected over his combat-free
career. How's that for subtle?
We slowly begin to learn things about Irwin (he was both a bad father and a
POW), but as Castle approaches the 70-minute mark, there are still two huge
questions left hanging in the air:  What crime did he commit, and where the
hell is Delroy Lindo?  But the background of his character barely matters
when he's so busy questioning and undermining Winter's authority.  Like the
song goes, Irwin wants to accentuate the positive when it comes to these
incarcerated soldiers, while Winter would rather dwell on the negatives in
their lives, like the times they committed murder and assault and stuff.
It's hard to say whether Irwin is doing it all for one last battlefield
victory, or out of sheer boredom, or because he has a legitimate beef with
Winter and his managerial style.
Castle was directed by former film critic Rod Lurie (The Contender), and
while his casts keep getting bigger and better, this is his first picture to
be penned by someone else.  Unfortunately, that "someone else" is David
Scarpa and Graham Yost, the latter of whom has churned out a whole lot of
crap (Mission to Mars, Hard Rain) since hitting pay dirt with Speed a decade
ago.  Their story is as far-fetched as anything you'll see on the screen
this year, and is worsened by their decision to make hardened criminals into
something resembling the football players in Remember the Titans.  I've got
a problem with prison pictures that are, essentially, about a guy who isn't
supposed to be there (which is why Oz is so frigging great), but making
every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way
too far.

According to its press notes, "The Last Castle" is about the character
of leadership. That, at least, is the line director Rod Lurie used to
convince Robert Redford to sign on the dotted line. From my chair, the
film is a silly, pretentious and generally entertaining yarn about the
pissing war between a fallen leader and a wannabe. The names Robert
Redford and James Gandolfini may lead one to expect something profound,
but the film is essentially a Grade B thriller cut from the same cloth
as "Taps" or "Toy Soldiers." Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Three-star Army General Irwin (Redford) disobeyed a direct order that
resulted in the death of several soldiers. Irwin admits his guilt and
makes no excuses; that's the kind of man he is. Sentenced to seven
years, he is sent to The Castle, a military prison ruled by the iron
fist of Colonel Winter (Gandolfini), a man with no battle experience who
collects military implements.
Are you getting the picture? Accepting guilt for disobeying orders =
Hero. Filling display cases with battle regalia when you have no battle
experience = Poseur.
At first, Winter views Irwin with awe. He is relieved to hear that his
revered prisoner wants only to do his time and go home. All is well
until he gives Irwin a tour of his office and shows off his war toys.
While Winter is called away briefly, Irwin chats with an aide and quotes
a disparaging remark his father once made about non-combatants who
collect weapons. Winter returns to the area just in time to hear the
latter part of the quote and assumes Irwin has just taken a shot at him.
Oops, looks like the honeymoon is over.
Over the next few days, Irwin gets acquainted with his fellow prisoners,
particularly Yates (Mark Ruffalo), cynic and resident prison bookmaker,
and Aguilar (Clifton Collins Jr.), a wide-eyed hero worshipper who may
as well have the word "martyr" stitched to his uniform.
Irwin soon galvanizes the men. Forced to spend the day moving rocks as a
punishment, he struggles but refuses to quit, winning the respect of the
few prisoners that did not already bow down before him. Fed up with
Winter's pattern of inhumane treatment, Irwin makes a decision: He will
organize the men, take over the prison and fly the flag in the
upside-down distress position to force the removal of Winter.
The build up to the grand confrontation is patently ridiculous, which
keeps matters fun. There is a hard rule against inmates saluting one
another, so the boys come up with a twist  a man snaps his hand into
the salute position, but at the last second runs his fingers through his
hair, just like Fonzie used to do. The men are also forbidden to address
each other by rank, so they use substitute terms like "chief" instead of
"general," "boss" instead of "captain" and so on. Winter is helpless to
stop them from using the new gestures and words, so we get to witness a
prisoner honoring a superior officer by saying, "Thank you, chief" while
giving him a hearty Fonzie.
Oh, what remarkable prisoners they are. Presumably, some of these guys
are sociopaths, rapists, child molesters and murderers, but under the
influence of Chief Irwin, they become a unified force ready to risk life
and limb and lengthier sentences to bring down the warden.
The absurdity goes down easier thanks to the skill of the key players.
James Gandolfini, taking a break from his Tony Soprano persona,
amplifies the childishness of his character by over-enunciating his
words and smirking at unexpected moments. Meanwhile, Robert Redford
underplays his role, relying on his legendary charisma instead of
histrionics. Redford also sets the standard for the lighting of the
film. While his rugged good looks have defied the aging process, under
bright light his skin looks like contact paper. To adjust for this,
every camera is angled to keep his face in shadows. For the sake of
consistency, the same technique is used on most of the other actors,
giving the film an odd, but interesting, visual tone.
To the surprise of no one, the climax of the film is heavy on
coincidence, self-sacrifice, abrupt shifts in allegiance, flag waving
and, of course, explosions. Some people will likely accept "The Last
Castle" at face value and applaud its patriotic trappings. Others may
condemn director Rod Lurie for the cheesiness of it all. As for me, I
can only offer thanks for two hours of peculiar entertainment. Mr.
Lurie, I Fonzie you!
