Hey, I've got a great idea for a movie! Ok, here it is: We'll get Tim Allen to
pull angry faces for about two hours or so! What's that? Sounds too boring?
Ok, how about this then: We still have Tim Allen pull faces for about two
hours, but half of them are angry looks and half of them are "I'm in pain!"
looks! What's that? That still doesn't sound funny to you? How about if we
through in some "ewwwww!" looks? Still not funny? If you answered "No, that
doesn't sound funny", then (DING DING DING!) you're absolutely correct!
FOR RICHER OR POORER is a moronic farce about a rich married couple (played by
Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley) who seek refuge in an Amish community after their
bumbling accountant (Wayne Knight, best know as Newman on TV's "Seinfeld")
gets them in trouble for tax evasion. What ensues is a badly scripted and
horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell. What makes this all wrong is
that nobody seems to have what the film needs . . . namely, talent!
Backing up, the married couple is Brad and Caroline Sexton (Allen and Alley),
a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else, but in reality
are on the brink of divorce. Just as their marriage seems to be hanging from
it's final thread, Brad discovers that his accountant, Bob Lachman (Knight),
has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the Sexton's names. The IRS catches
on, but since everything points back to the Sexton's and not Lachman, there is
nothing much to do . . . except run away and join an Amish community.
First time screenwriters Jana Howington and Steve LuKanic give us a couple of
chuckle-out-loud moments, and even some decent laughs here and *way* over
there, but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that
you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn. Alley is absolutely
unwatchable, and the chemistry between her and Allen is about as believable as
my chemistry homework from tenth grade (which, I inform you, was total B.S.).
Allen and Alley are in no way convincing as tycoons, nor are they very
convincing as an Amish couple! This entire movie is one bad ill-conceived
notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning!
The Amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing. It's such a trite,
stereotypical script that I imagine the actors that were cast (noticing that
they're all predominantly TV figures) were probably the only ones they could
get! Bryan Spicer's directing doesn't help one bit, either. In fact, listing
Spicer's filmography (which includes the first "Power Rangers" movie and the
big screen adaption of MCHALE'S NAVY) is more of an insult than a résumé!
Now that I've pretty much run FOR RICHER OR POORER into the ground, I will let
you in on the best thing about it. It bumped seven films up a notch on my
"worst of" 1997 movie list. That's right, thanks to this film ranking at
number 3 for the year's worst, six films are now not seemingly as bad, and A
SMILE LIKE YOURS, previously inhabiting the number ten spot, now doesn't have
to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list. If you look at it in that
respect, FOR RICHER OR POORER will end up making someone happy after all!

     The winter holiday season box office sweepstakes is on, with 
Paramount opening TITANIC, Fox weighing in with GREAT EXPECTATIONS and 
HOME ALONE 3, Warner Brothers sending out THE POSTMAN, Dreamworks 
releasing AMISTAD and MOUSEHUNT, Miramax debuting JACKIE BROWN and GOOD 
WILL HUNTING, Disney blinding us with MR. MAGOO, and Columbia/TriStar 
showing AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  So what "prestige title" is Universal 
contributing to the mix?  How about FOR RICHER OR POORER, Tim Allen's 
latest dud.  If ever a motion picture was destined for oblivion, this is 
it.  No major studio stands to make less money during December 1997.
     As comedies go, FOR RICHER OR POORER isn't absolutely terrible 
(it's better than HOME ALONE 3, for example), but neither is it 
particularly laudable.  All things considered, it's a pretty generic 
offering.  A few of the gags are capable of generating chuckles, but 
most are shockingly unfunny.  There's little or no genuine character 
development, and everyone on screen represents one form or another of 
stereotype.  The script is, to put it mildly, uninspired.  I see at 
least a dozen movies like this every year, and, by the time it comes to 
assemble my year-end retrospective, I find it difficult to distinguish 
one from another.  
     Creatively, this is Tim Allen's second motion picture failure of 
the year (the other was JUNGLE2JUNGLE).  Likewise, it's director Bryan 
Spicer's second straight bad outing (following hot on the heels of 
Bottom-10 contender MCHALE'S NAVY).  Together, these two talents 
definitely don't make magic.  In fact, they're hard pressed to make many 
laughs.  Worse still, FOR RICHER OR POORER clocks in at an unbearably 
long 116 minutes.  There's no way that a light, essentially-pointless 
comedy should be this long.  Cut about 30 minutes off the running time, 
and it might be a shade more bearable.  
     A better name for FOR RICHER OR POORER would probably be WITLESS, 
since it seems designed as a takeoff on the Harrison Ford thriller, 
WITNESS.  The basic premise has Brad and Caroline Sexton (Tim Allen and 
Kirstie Alley), an ultra-rich couple on the verge of a divorce, being 
forced to flee from their New York City penthouse when the IRS discovers 
some irregularities in their tax returns.  It seems that their 
accountant (Wayne Knight) has absconded with $5 million, and left the 
Sextons holding the bag.  Now, an overzealous IRS agent (Larry Miller) 
wants to put them behind bars or shoot them -- whichever is most 
expedient.  Their flight from the law takes them to Intercourse, 
Pennsylvania -- Amish country.  By pretending to be visitors from the 
Midwest, they find refuge with one family.  The rest of the film follows 
them as they grow to appreciate the simple way of life, and, in the 
process, fall in love again with each other.  
     While Allen is merely bland, Kirstie Alley is downright irritating.  
The actress appears stuck in CHEERS mode.  This is a television 
performance on the big screen, and its limitations show.  No one else in 
the cast does much to eclipse her, however.  Wayne Knight and Michael 
Lerner have small parts.  Jay O. Sanders and Megan Cavanaugh, playing 
the Amish couple the Sextons live with, have a little more screen time, 
but their roles, like their performances, are largely forgettable.  
     Most of the film's limited humor comes as a result of Allen, who 
occasionally displays an aptitude for physical comedy.  There's also a 
mildly amusing gag concerning an old man who arrives at 4:45 am each 
morning to get everyone up for the day's work.  Larry Miller is supposed 
to be funny, but I never found myself laughing at his uptight, tough guy 
routine.  Other than that meager fare, there's not much mirth to be 
found in FOR RICHER OR POORER, and, since the drama is insubstantial and 
irritating, that means the movie doesn't have a lot to offer.  Universal 
should have kept this one under wraps until Christmas was over.

TV stars Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley jump into a cinematic comedy about
a rich couple having to deal with the sudden loss of all of their
assets.
PLOT:
Rich, self-absorbed husband and wife team fall into major IRS problems,
when their accountant steals from their funds, and flees the country.
Forced to hide from the government until their lawyer gets things
settled, the duo crash in on an Amish community, and pretend to be
long-lost cousins. Then, the "hilarity" begins.
CRITIQUE:
Uninspired, predictable, and mostly unfunny comedy that joins TRIAL AND
ERROR (4/10) in proving that for some reason, Hollywood executives like
to correlate bad comedies with longer run times (This one clocks in at
a little under two hours.) I never really understood why people in the
Woods of Holly liked to explore the Amish community to such an extent
in film, and this bad movie does little to resolve my unanswerable
query. KINGPIN (8/10) successfully stepped through such a community
last year, but this movie just doesn't gather any comedy or originality
out of this age-old community of people. 
In regards to the actors, Tim Allen doesn't add anything to this
horrible punch, and Alley barely musters any added value, after she
spends the first hour and a half of the film whining about her newfound
situation. Larry Miller is actually pretty funny as the overly
exuberant IRS agent on their tail (He carries a large gun with him at
all times.) But other than him, the film is basically retreading the
old "fish out of water" tale for the umpteenth time, without a whimper
of innovation or entertainment.
The worst part about this movie is that even the lame attempts at
humour are marred by adult content, which disavows any kids from seeing
this dud on video. And to top that off, they decide to pull another
pseudo-case of MY GIANT (6/10) and get semi-serious near the end of the
film (This is where we recognize these people as regular folks like you
and I with hearts.) Not one laugh out loud joke here. Nothing original
to add to anything based in Amish folklore. Actors are very generic in
their roles. Avoid this one at all costs, and please try to recommend
it to those all those people who you deeply despise. 
By the way, if you do happen to rent it by mistake, at least stay tuned
for the outtakes during the end credits. They are actually the only
snickerable things in the whole movie (Not a good sign.) 
Little Known Facts: 
In 1978, Tim Allen spent 28 months in jail after being arrested for
attempted drug dealing. His real name is Timothy Allen Dick. He has
nine brothers and sisters.
Kirstie Alley stands 5"7, and is a member of the Church of Scientology.
She was part of TV's "Cheers" ensemble cast from 1987 to 1993.
Larry Miller's most famous role was as the nice Rodeo Drive salesman to
Julia Roberts in 1990's PRETTY WOMAN (7.5/10).
Director Bryan Spicer's previous attempt at cinematic humour was the
ill-fated MCHALE'S NAVY.

Universal / 1:56 / 1997 / PG-13 (language, sex jokes)

Although "Home Improvement"'s Tim Allen and "Veronica's Closet"'s Kirstie 
Alley know success on the small screen, their collaborative efforts are 
marred in translation to the silver one with "For Richer or Poorer." Both 
stars are in top form here, and they even manage to pull off a few very 
funny bits before the film exchanges silly spoofing of the Amish culture 
in for sloppy sentimentality involving love and marriage. Let's put it 
this way -- there's a reason it's called "For Richer or Poorer" and not 
"Madcap Mennonite Misadventures." 
Allen and Alley play Brad and Caroline Sexton, an obnoxious, wealthy New 
York couple on the verge of a not-too-amicable divorce around the time of 
their 10th wedding anniversary. But before they can officially untie the 
knot, the IRS comes looking for them -- it seems their slimy accountant 
(Wayne Knight, Newman from "Seinfeld") has stolen $5 million from their 
accounts and set it up to look like tax fraud. They steal a cab and end 
up crashing in Intercourse, Pennsylvania (ha, ha) -- Amish country -- 
where they masquerade as a prominent farm family's cousins from the 
Midwest (but where'd they get their duds?). What follows is a semi-parody 
of "Witness," as the Sextons lay low with the Amish and grow accustomed 
to the hard-working simplicity of their everyday lives. 
In a fish-out-of-water comedy, taking the fish out of water around the 
40-minute mark isn't a very good idea -- especially when we're not given 
very many reasons to like either of our protagonists. But Allen and Alley 
(why is he billed above the title while she's not?) do get away with some 
great one-liners and nifty sight gags, the best of which are probably 
worth sticking around for. There's a hilarious dinner sequence where Brad 
and Caroline invent reasons for the liberal rules of their cluster to 
appease their inquiring "relatives" (the justification for Brad's 
clean-shaven face -- "minute lice") as well as a funny running gag 
involving a 4:45 a.m. wake-up call and what I believe is the very first 
Amish fashion show ever captured on film. 
Basically, "For Richer or Poorer" is okay whenever it lets its incognito 
couple go for each other's throats, which better explains that sinking 
feeling that occurs during a needless detour towards schmaltz in its 
final third. We're asked to swallow that the warm, intimate values of the 
Amish lifestyle melt Brad and Caroline's hearts and cause them to 
re-evaluate their relationship, a big, misguided no-no considering what 
shallow jerks they're depicted as until then. Other inconsistencies and 
flaws pop up, the cap-off of which is a surprisingly unfunny blooper reel 
(a la "The Nutty Professor" and the "Grumpy Old Men" movies) that runs 
during the closing credits. Come on -- such a funny leading man and lady 
and you're telling me the best outtake you've got is Alley slipping and 
sliding in pigpen mud? 
Still, for such a stinky story, Allen and Alley are constantly engaging; 
he's put to good use after the respectively poor and even-worse "The 
Santa Clause" and "Jungle 2 Jungle," while she makes quite an 
eye-catching comeback after a several-year movie drought (her last big 
role, I believe, was that of a chain-smoking scientist in 1995's 
outlandish "Village of the Damned" remake). The real Amish have some sort 
of rule about not being captured on film, and aside from Allen and Alley, 
"For Richer or Poorer" and fellow faith-offender "Kingpin" (the spoof of 
several summers ago which cast Randy Quaid as an Amish bowling protégé) 
just don't do much to prove that the creed needs a makeover.

   Possibly inspired by the marriage of Donald and Ivana
Trump, "For Richer or Poorer" is a sentimental comedy that
preaches the benefits of moderation on all sides. 
Unfortunately, it has been marred by a faulty trailer that
highlights the movie's plantation pratfalls over verbal parries. 
Although the dialogue often veers toward TV sitcom humor,
"For Richer or Poorer" provides a generous number of holiday
laughs while underscoring a believable chemistry between
Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley.  Most of the movie is set in Amish
country, specifically the town of Intercourse, Pennsylvania,
with insights into the culture of the local Plain People provided
by the director's consultation with a former member of the
community who left the order after eighteen years.
   The picture can help deflect any envy you might harbor
toward the very rich.  Tim Allen is in the role of Brad Sexton,
a real estate developer who is unhappily married to Caroline
Sexton (Kirstie Alley), a woman whose only profession is
shopping.  One of Brad's pet projects is the development of a
Disney-style theme park based on events in the Old
Testament, including a spectacular exhibition of the burning
bush, a Noah's arcade, a Torah, Torah, Torah attraction with
a targeted market of Jews and Japanese, and a Masada Inn
to relax after wading through kitsch.  When the IRS advises
Brad's accountant Bob (Wayne Knight) that his client is under
investigation for fraud, Brad and Caroline steal a taxi and race
toward a hideout where they hope they cannot be found by
the authorities.  They find this Shangri-La in the area
encompassed by Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the home of a
strict order of Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish), where they pass
themselves off as cousins of Samuel Yoder (Jay O. Sanders).
    At first considering the place to be worse than prison, the
incompatible Sextons learn the value of discipline, simplicity,
and doing work of genuine value. In return they offer valuable
counsel to their hosts, such as advice on the purchase of
farm land and the benefits of relaxing their strict code of
conduct to allow the use of "God's rainbow of colors" in the
somber black-and-gray attire of the members.
   While there is a considerable emphasis on physical humor
including Brad's experience with a horse that steps on his
foot, the movie has cute zingers that should bring a smile to
all by the most jaded in the audience.  When the vane
Caroline rhetorically asks, "How will I face my friends?" her
husband replies, "Pretend they're a mirror."  The highlight is a
fashion show sponsored by Caroline--who learns that real
work and unselfish giving make her happier than she has
ever been--using members of the Amish community to model
colorful clothes in their attempt to convince the elders to allow
a livelier dress code.  When Brad comes out modeling an
intensely blue shirt, Caroline calls the outfit brimming with
"blueberry and blackberry" hues.
   Director Bryan Spicer falters only when he introduces off-
the-wall characters like IRS agent Derek Lester (Larry Miller),
who acts like a keystone cop as he relentlessly pursues the
two outlaws.  When the movie concentrates on the
interchange between the Sextons and their Amish hosts, it
glides along on the appropriate side of credibility.  "For Richer
or Poorer" is in no way as sharp or witty as the year's best
comedy, "As Good As It Gets," but offers enough laughs and
sentimentality to include in your repertory of holiday
moviegoing.  Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 122 minutes.  (C)

In this big mistake and excuse for a Tim Allen film, one can see him
silently tearing his inside out trying to be funny on screen. Any
comedian will tell you that trying to be funny means doesn't actually
mean trying to be funny. What made Tim Allen a success in HOME
IMPROVEMENT, was the fact that he played the regular husband, father and
tool man with a comic ease that came naturally. In the surroundings of
wife to banter with, boys to play with, best friend to tease and
neighbour to listen to, Tim Allen presents his best work. Take him out
of this environment and Allen falters poorly. He made an atrocious SANTA
CLAUSE, a terrible businessman/father in JUNGLE TO JUNGLE, and is no
better as a real estate developer FOR RICHER OR POORER. Maybe his claim
to fame, will also be his bane as he will forever be compared to and
labelled the TOOL MAN.
The story surrounds Brad and Caroline Sexton (Tim Allen and Kirsty
Alley), successful real estate developers. Beneath the exterior of
wealth and glamour, their perfect marriage is actually in shambles. To
make matters worse, their accountant has embezzled 5 million dollars,
leaving them to take the fall for the crime. With the RSI hot on their
heels, the Sextons are forced to take shelter in an Amish community. It
is here that they find love again.
It is here that Allen and Alley try to generate laughs by adopting Amish
customs and habits. Unfortunately, there is nothing much to laugh about.
Allen is mostly in the fields ploughing, whilst Alley learns to cook,
scrub floors and sew. Like regular farmers. Kirsty Alley is as usual
playing a whiney, naggy, difficult woman and Allen tries too hard to be
who he isn't  a tool man trying to be farmer. However, there is one
scene where Alley puts on an Amish floorshow that is quite entertaining.
Otherwise, the intended romance and chemistry between Allen and Alley
doesn't exist, and the ending comes as abruptly as saying Amen' in the
middle of supper.
So the vows go, For richer or poorer, for better or worse, in sickness
and in health, till death do us part.' So how can I sum up this movie?
Simply  'For poorer, for worse, in sickness and death'.
