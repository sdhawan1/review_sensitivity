Insulting, unlikable, badly acted, yet a tribute to how much Kevin Smith
believes in his friends, Vulgar looks like a high school film project
completed the day before it was due. Produced by Smith and written, directed
and edited by Bryan Johnson (better known as Steve Dave from Smith's
View-Askewniverse), the film caused dozens of people to flee the theatre at
last year's Toronto International Film Festival. Walkouts are somewhat of a
rarity in Toronto, especially with the director and stars in attendance
(seated right next to the door, no less), so that should give you an idea of
what we're dealing with here.
You know how some adults are still spooked by the sight of clowns? Those
folks should stay far away from Vulgar. Actually, now that I think about it,
everyone should stay away from Vulgar. The film stars Brian O'Halloran
(better know as Dante Hicks from Clerks) as Will Carlson, a sad sack young
man who dresses as a clown and works children's birthday parties. Without
getting into too many of the sick details, Will ends up in the wrong place
at the wrong time and gets gang-raped by a father and two sons who videotape
the anal intrusion.
Somehow, Will becomes a hero and gets his own television show (called
"Flappy's Funhouse"), but finds himself blackmailed by his rapists, who have
the rape tape. There are familiar faces (like Smith, Jason Mewes, Walter
Flanagan, Scott Mosier and Ethan Suplee), a familiar setting (Red Bank, New
Jersey, natch) and some familiar gags (like calling someone a "fudgestick"),
but Vulgar is mostly nasty and, uh, vulgar. The crowd in Toronto, which was
packed full of Smith's fans, anxiously jumped all over anything that
involved the slightest hint of a joke with nervous laughter.
1:37 - R for violence, graphic dialogue and sexuality including rape
