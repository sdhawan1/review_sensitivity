In the days of yore only those of noble birth were allowed the honor of 
knighthood. The superstar athlete of his day, the knight would compete in 
mock battle at staged tournaments for the pleasure of the masses. One young 
man, lowborn William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), defies convention when he 
impersonates his now-dead liege lord and goes for the gold in "A Knight's 
Tale." 
Writer/director Brian Helgeland delved into film noire, and earned a 
screenplay Oscar in the process, with his period crime thriller, "L.A. 
Confidential." He takes a sharp turn from mayhem to mirth with his latest 
oeuvre, covering territories that range from medieval fairytale adventure 
to contemporary pop culture. Mixing period and pop is a hard task that 
rarely meets with success, though there are exceptions, most involving 
Shakespeare. 
There is an obvious hip ness to the material that is the crux of the 
juggling act the writer/director is trying to perform. Throughout the film 
he intersperses modern music and readily identifiable contemporary film and 
social references that meld the modern with the medieval. We're greeted, at 
the start of a jousting tournament, with the raucous refrains of Queen's 
"We Will Rock You" and the Middle Ages crowd of onlookers clapping and 
stomping and doing waves. It's slick and amusing, though the disparity in 
periods brings attention to itself as the film plays on. 
The routine, oft-told tale of a young commoner striving to be something 
beyond his birthright, to "change his stars," is a staple for modern 
storytelling. Helgeland doesn't screw around with the rags to riches 
structure and concentrates on the exciting action of the tournament events 
- particularly the high-profile jousting matches - and his characters. 
Heath Ledger is the first among equals in an ensemble effort that gives the 
young actor a chance to showcase himself while others get their chance at 
the limelight, too. The young Australian made a likable debut in "10 Things 
I Hate About You" and continues to build upon his good looks and easygoing 
charm as the ambitious Will Thatcher. Ledger handles the gamut of tasks put 
before him and acquits himself quite well riding, singing, dancing, sword 
fighting, and in comedy and stunt work. 
The band of misfits accompanying William on his quest are an eclectic 
collection of affable rogues who are reluctantly drawn in to the young 
squire's hair-brained, and potentially deadly, scheme. Mark Addy ("The Full 
Monty") is solid as the serious-minded best friend, Roland. Alan Tudyk 
plays William's enforcer, Wat, a carrot-topped vassal whose hot-headedness 
is tempered by his loyalty to his friends. Rounding out William's merry men 
is a young poet and story-teller named Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany), who 
acts as Williams press agent, promoter and ring announcer, and a pretty 
blacksmith named Kate (Laura Fraser), a real master of metals. The only 
problem with these characters and their performances is you don't get 
enough of them. The rest of the cast is adequate, though Shannyn Sossamon 
as the love interest, Jocelyn, is pretty but little more than an object of 
affection - no sparks fly between her and William. 
The production is first-class with great attention paid to medieval period 
details, but with a contempo feel throughout. The big tournie scenes 
maintain a Super Bowl atmosphere with the audience hyped to a fever pitch 
as the jousting action mounts. The jousts tend to be repetitive, as 
expected when two guys try to knock each other off their horses with a big 
stick, but slickly edited and visually exciting. The behind-the-camera tech 
team members providing the visuals for "A Knight's Tale" are equal to the 
director's talent and vision. Cinematographer Richard Greatrex, production 
designer Tony Burrough, and costumer and armor designer Caroline Harris 
contribute to the modern/medieval look that Helgeland seeks. 
The use of modern pop and rock music is handled in an amusing and 
interesting way, with each tune selected to appropriately fit the scene in 
which it is used. David Bowie's "Golden Years" is used over a Middle Ages 
line dance; Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Takin' Care of Business" plays as 
William establishes himself as the leader and true friend of his little 
band; The World Series of tournaments, London, has the dream team come into 
town under Thin Lizzy's "The Boys Are Back In Town." Each tune works and 
will please the hipsters in the audience. 
Brian Helgeland picked a tough nut in his combo of "Rocky" meets the 
knights of old yarn and, while not a great film, "A Knight's Tale" does a 
sound job in putting together the combination. The attractive, likable cast 
and excellent production values overcome the sometimes overly hip 
screenplay. I give it a B.

A young thatcher's son William aspires to the impossible dream of becoming a
knight, a title reserved for the noble born.  When the adult William (Heath
Ledger, "The Patriot") is faced with his liege Knight's death before the
final round of a joust, he seizes an opportunity, shielded from questioning
eyes by his benefactor's armor in writer/director Brian Helgeland's "A
Knight's Tale."
Who would have predicted the writer of "L.A. Confidential" and director
of Mel Gibson's "Payback" would make his hyphenate debut with such a risky
premise?  "A Knight's Tale" is a bold melding of a modern rock score and
culture with the medieval jousting tournament circuit of the 14th century.
We're thrown into the excitment as Queen's "We Will Rock You" blares,
peasants in the stands do a wave and a young wench boogies to the music.
William wins the third round merely by staying on his horse (his knight
was ahead in the first two rounds) and amusingly stays undercover by dint
of the dent delivered to his helmet by his opponent's lance.  William and his
starving cohorts Roland (Mark Addy, "The Full Monty") and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 
"28 Days") quickly convert the prize into fifteen silver florins.  After 
heated debate, William convinces them to invest the money into turning
him into a tournament competitor rather than immediately gratifying their
stomaches.
One amusing Rocky-like training montage later, the trio make their way
towards the next meet, picking up a very nude Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany,
"Bent") along the roadside when he offers to fake William's nobility papers 
and perform as his herald.  Once there, William espies his lady fair, Jocelyn 
(newcomer Shannyn Sossamon) and crosses the man who will be his arch rival in 
both love and war, Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewall, "Dark City").  A need for 
armor repair on account over currency adds female blacksmith Kate (Laura 
Fraser, "Titus") to William's entourage.
If "The Patriot" didn't catapult Heath Ledger into full fledged stardom,
"A Knight's Tale" surely will.  Ledger exudes down to earth charm 
as well as being up to the physical demands of medieval tournament
competition.  He can also cut a mean rug.  Ledger's more than ably supported.
Paul Bettany is comicly inspired as the scene-stealing, gambling addicted
future author of 'The Canterbury Tales.'   His hammy, hilarious deliveries of
'Sir Ulrich's' qualifications are one of the film's highlights and his
character's weakness provides an opportunity for William to show what he's made
of. Alan Tudyk also provides laughs as the fiery redhead whose approach to
almost any situation is like a pitbull's.  Addy is the more level-headed
voice of reason.  Laura Fraser quietly makes a strong stand for women's lib.
Sewell is a haughty, egotistical cheat, and therefore, a good villain.  
Newcomer Sossamon has an exotic beauty, but adds little else to the mix.
Helgeland's script has the right mix of humor, action, adventure and
sentiment, although a couple of jarring character changes (William accuses his
beloved of being a silly girl out of the blue, only to have to win her back; a
romance that seems to be percolating between the widowed Kate and Roland is
abandoned) may be attributable to editting for run time.  He blends pop culture
in with ancient history cleverly, usually managing to get a laugh.
Kate designs new, more lightweight armor and etches in her 'brand,' which
resembles a Nike logo.  A courtly medieval dance evolves into present day
moves to David Bowie's "Golden Years."
Cinematographer Richard Greatrex ("Shakespeare in Love") along with the film's
editor and sound designer make you feel every connection of the knights'
lances with their targets.  Costume design by Caroline Harris ("An Ideal
Husband") mostly works, although Jocelyn's outfits are sometimes too outlandish
(one costume featuring a straw bonnet would look more at home at "My Fair
Lady's" horse race).
"A Knight's Tale" is rousing fun - it rocks.

 A KNIGHT'S TALE (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Heath Ledger, Mark
Addy, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, Shannyn Sossamon, Alan Tudyk and Laura
Fraser. Music by Carter Burwell. Written, produced and directed by Brian
Helgeland. PG-13.
 You are immediately jarred at the outset of A Knightís Tale when a
contestant in a jousting tournament rides onto the field, the soundtrack
begins blaring ěWe Will Rock Youî and the audience claps along to the
beat.
What the heck is going on?
 Perhaps the filmís writer-producer-director, Brian Helgeland (an
Oscar-winner for his L.A. Confidential script), can explain: ěWe wanted
to create a period piece that stayed fair to the period but felt
contemporary. ... For a movie to work, the audience has to be invited
in. They can get pushed away if overwhelmed by period costumes, obscure
speech and antique music. ... Our goal was to create a seamless bridge
between then and now.î
 Nice sentiments, noble proposal. Unfortunately, the concept for A
Knightís Tale is more distracting than beneficial.
 The movieís central plot is about jousting, painted by Helgeland as
sort of the XFL of the middle ages. Knights would travel from tournament
to tournament, battling each other for prizes and glory; standings were
kept; peasants would paint themselves in the colors of their favorite
knights; heralds would introduce their knights, in a manner reminiscent
of Vince McMahon revving up the crowd at a WWF match; and their would be
a tournament of tournament at which the grand champion would be crowned.
 All this, of course, makes it difficult as to how to view A Knightís
Tale: a comedy, a spoof, a period action-adventure, a drama. Helgeland
has made it a hodge-podge of all of the aforementioned genres.
 His story revolves around William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), squire to a
veteran knight. When his employer is found sitting under a tree dead,
William, with the help of his friends. Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan
Tudyk), puts on the knightís armor, takes his place at the joust and
wins the tournament.
 William then decides to use the prize money to fulfill his dream of
becoming a championship jouster. Unfortunately, only knights are
permitted to joust, so William ó with the help of an unemployed writer
named Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany) ó reinvents himself as Sir Ulrich von
Lichtenstein of Gelderland and begins his climb up the tournament
ladder.
 A Knightís Tale is a corny, fairy tale, yet somehow it exudes an
innocent and winning charm. You know, historically, itís rubbish, but so
go along just for the fun.
 For example, you laugh when William ó along with the other knights ó
marches triumphantly into the London he left as a child and the
soundtrack blasts out Tin Lizzyís ěThe Boys Are Back in Town.î
 This is definitely a movie not to be taken seriously. if it is
anything, A Knightís Tale is a showcase for the charisma of up-and-comer
Heath L:edger, best known for portraying Mel Gibsonís son in The Patriot
as well as for wooing Julia Stiles in Ten Things I Hate About You.
 He has a wonderful screen presence and a very nonchalant manner. He
acts as the various occasions demands ó serious whe needed, tongue
planted in cheek when called for.
 He is a looker who carries a fluff piece such as this with ease. It
will be interesting to see him in more demanding roles.
 A Knightís Tale will more likely appeal to a younger audience. Medieval
scholars might as well stay home as you will wind up shouting at the
screen in frustration or rage at the historical liberties the film
takes.
 But this is not meant as a documentary about the middle ages. A
Knightís Tale is an uneven parable about heroes, fame and self-worth.
That Helgeland tried to give it a contemporary spin is commendable. It
is too bad he was not totally successful.

Just avoid it. It's that simple. `A Knight's Tale' is a new medieval jousting
comedy/drama that molds itself into whatever the story requires, with little
regard for plausibility, time, reason, or feeling. The movie is like a young
child that's just discovered clay. It is juvenile, and severely lacking in form,
content, and consistency.
That said, Heath Ledger is awfully good as William Thatcher, a squire who takes
over his dead master's position in of-noble-blood-only jousting matches across
Europe. William has trained since childhood, and has the skills and sheer gut
for competition. He just needs some practice. As he rises to prominence, he
gains a rival (Rufus Sewell), and goes after the heart of a fair maiden (Shannyn
Sossamon). Also showing up are two annoying actors, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk as
`humorous' sidekicks. 
The film opens with a crowd of bloodthirsty jousting patrons hungrily awaiting
carnage, and simultaneously clapping and singing along with Queen's `We Will
Rock You'. The modern rock hit fun continues throughout, with Thin Lizzy, David
Bowie, and Heart eventually getting in on the action. The scoring gives the film
a modern effect it doesn't need. Just when writer/director Brian Helgeland
manages to get his production back on track, he derails with another song. Let's
give them Eric Clapton and sword fighting! No! Let's do Robbie Williams and
medieval slaughter!
It doesn't help that jousting really isn't that exciting, and Helgeland doesn't
attempt to make it so. He does, at least, explain the rules of the game, which
are helpful to the non-history-oriented, but to this 21st-century eye, the game
just comes off as silly. Thousands of years from now, I'm sure the creatures
living on Earth will think the same thing of beach volleyball.
After supporting roles in two other Columbia productions, `10 Things I Hate
About You' and `The Patriot', Heath Ledger gets his first starring role. He does
his best, and brings a mix of boyish charm and ruggedness often associated with
the likes of Matt Damon or fellow countryman Russell Crowe. The other
performances are passable, never quite meeting satisfactory.
`A Knight's Tale' tries desperately to be a younger, hipper version of
`Gladiator', and it fails. It doesn't matter that the story veers nowhere, and
the supporting actors need medical help, but that Helgeland has no, even vague,
point to this whole mess. Add that the film is almost never entertaining or
funny, and its quality, even as airplane entertainment, becomes highly
questionable.
But what about Heath Ledger, the smiling, good-looking Australian star? Well, he
has better things ahead of him, hopefully. He's talented, and gives this summer
movie masses of deceiving credibility. Better luck next time.

NOTE: A feature on Heath Ledger follows this review.
After watching "A Knight's Tale" the first time, I scanned my notes and
saw a laundry list of flaws. The film is sloppy, self-indulgent and
about 20 minutes too long. The story is, to put it kindly, overly
familiar. And jousting, no matter how cleverly shot, is one dull damned
sport. But regardless of all its failings, I liked the movie. The
central characters were endearing and I loved the camaraderie between
them. Last weekend, I attended another advance screening of the film
and, to my surprise, enjoyed it even more the second time around. "A
Knight's Tale" is a mess, but it's my kind of mess.
Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for the "L.A.
Confidential" screenplay, takes the story of a young man pretending to
be a knight and plays fast and loose with the particulars. Although it
is set in the 14th century, the characters talk like 21st century folks.
The Nike logo turns up on a suit of armor. A princess wears a variety of
attractive, but bizarre, outfits that do not fit the time period,
including one number that looks like something Audrey Hepburn wore in
"Breakfast at Tiffany's." As if all that wasn't enough, the orchestral
score is spiced with a number of classic rock songs, from Queen's "We
Will Rock You" to War's "Low Rider." Purists are already howling about
the movie, of course, but who cares? What Helgeland does here is fun.
A side note: One critic accuses the filmmaker of using the rock
chestnuts to "woo the youth market." Pardon me, but does this guy really
think that kids who listen to current pop music are going to embrace a
production because its soundtrack includes "Taking Care of Business" and
"The Boys are Back in Town?" Give me a break. The paying audience at the
sneak I attended Saturday were mostly couples ranging from adult to late
middle age.
The frills in "A Knight's Tale" may be from left field, but the story is
strictly (in fact, overly) traditional. William (Heath Ledger from "The
Patriot") is squire to Sir Ector, a jousting legend who dies at the
beginning of the film. Desperate for money, the young man convinces
fellow squires Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk) to assist him as
he furtively dons the knight's armor to compete in his place. The facade
is successful and William decides to work towards the world
championships, despite the fact that peasants are not allowed to
participate.
Luckily, the boys run into the one and only Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany)
staggering naked down the dirt path. Years away from his Canterbury
days, the unemployed writer and chronic gambler joins them and forges a
fine set of identification papers. William becomes Sir Ulrich von
Lichtenstein of Gelderland, jouster extraordinaire, with Chaucer
providing florid intro speeches that would make a WWF wrestler tear up
with joy. A fiery blacksmith named Kate (Laura Fraser) soon joins the
gang as they head from stadium to stadium, with rapturous crowds
chanting Ulrich's name.
William is enraptured as well, by the beautiful, hauty Jocelyn (Shannyn
Sossamon). While he tries to win the heart of the fair maiden, an enemy
glowers from the sidelines. Sir Adhemar (Rufus Sewell from "Dark City")
detests the young upstart and makes clear his intentions to retain his
jousting title and to snatch Jocelyn while he is at it.
Helgeland brought his cast together in Prague a month before shooting
began to practice jousting and get to know each other. The actors spent
their days rehearsing and their nights drinking. By the end of their
prep time they were thick as thieves and the results show up onscreen.
The relaxed bond between the actors/characters makes the film work, even
when the dialogue is weak. Mark Addy ("The Full Monty") and Alan Tudyk
make a particularly likable team, with Addy bouncing caustic one-liners
off Tudyk's chronic blustering. Paul Bettany is an absolute hoot as
Chaucer, with Laura Fraser's down to earth performance anchoring the
group.
The best segment in the film shows off the talents of the three lead
players. A formal dance begins with harpsichord music and turns into a
joyous contemporary romp set to David Bowie's "Golden Years." Heath
Ledger is dashing and charismatic, with his unforced masculinity filling
the screen. Newcomer Shannyn Sossamon projects erotic elegance as she
puts her dance training to good use. The two serve as a delightful
center to a magical scene. While they strut their stuff, Rufus Sewell
does some remarkably subtle acting. Watch his face as he makes the
transitions from arrogance to anger to confusion to sadness to defeat,
all without a single word.
The playful, frothy moments of "A Knight's Tale" shine, while the latter
part of the film suffers from an attack of mawkishness, finally turning
into a medieval "Rocky."  Brian Helgeland needs more discipline as a
director. At two hours and eight minutes, his movie screams for editing.
I'd have cut some of the jousting scenes, which are numbingly
repetitive. I also would have rewritten the entire third act and
deep-sixed the pathos. But the bottom line is that Helgeland's
incongruous flourishes and top-notch ensemble cast save the film from
its many, many problem areas.
Inside a tin can: Heath Ledger stars in 'A Knight's Tale'
Heath Ledger is a movie star about to happen. Beyond mere good looks, he
has that hard to describe but impossible to miss quality that makes him
a real presence onscreen. Anyone who saw him as the cool outsider in "10
Things I Hate About You" or as Mel Gibson's eldest son in "The Patriot"
understands. And the marketers at Columbia Pictures certainly know. His
new film, "A Knight's Tale," is an adventure/romance set in medieval
times, but instead of displaying images of jousting or swordplay,
posters for the movie simply feature a close-up of the 21-year-old's
face, with the tag line, "He will rock you."
So how does it feel to have a big summer flick riding on your shoulders?
"The thought never enters your mind," said Ledger, nursing a bottle of
water in a Beverly Hills hotel suite, "not while you're making the
movie. I guess afterwards, when you see that [gestures to a reproduction
of the poster], it is daunting. It's slightly intimidating. But I also
know the process, I know the studio's process, how they market movies
and how they're marketing this movie. It's your job and you feel like a
product sometimes, and you are. The movie is a product and I'm a product
of the movie. Their job was to try and create a style as fast as they
could to sell the movie. It can piss you off but it's also out of your
control to a certain degree, so you just have to relax with it."
In person, Heath Ledger seems anything but a hot Hollywood property.
Sitting at the table in casual clothes with mussed up hair, he comes off
as refreshingly average, younger looking than on film and quite
unguarded. Over the years I've talked with a numbing stream of sprayed,
moussed and gelled 20something actors whose every word sounded
programmed. This is a nice change of pace.
Writer/director Brian Helgeland, whose screenplay for "L.A.
Confidential" won an Academy Award, did not have Ledger in mind when he
wrote his story, which playfully mixes elements from other time periods
into its 14th century setting. "The character had to be able to sword
fight and joust and ride and sing and dance," said Helgeland. "And he
had to have a very self-possessed quality. Heath's name came up  he was
shooting "The Patriot" at the time  and I asked 'What's he done?' I
hadn't seen "10 Things" and then they said he starred in the short-lived
TV series "Roar," which was kind of a cheesy "Xena" type adventure show.
I had seen it a couple of times, just switching channels, and I
remembered him from that. I remember thinking 'What an awful show, but
he was really good, whoever this guy is.'"
A meeting was set up at LAX, as Ledger was preparing to fly home to
Australia. The two chatted for a bit, with Ledger saying he liked the
script, then Helgeland asked about the long tube the actor had at his
side. It was a didjeridoo, the droning instrument popularized
domestically as part of the theme song and score for "Survivor: The
Australian Outback." Ledger hauled it out and played it for the
filmmaker, who was delighted. "I liked him and I thought 'Who else could
it be but this guy?'" Helgeland explained. "I got him to agree to play
it in the movie. He went off and we made a deal."
But when filming began, Ledger stalled every time the didjeridoo was
mentioned. During the last week of shooting, Helgeland pressed for an
explanation and finally got one. "He told me he'd been thinking about it
and said, 'I don't want to play it. It's an Aboriginal instrument and
I'm afraid that if it appears in a medieval movie people will think it's
a European instrument.' This hadn't crossed my mind at all. I don't know
how to articulate it, I just thought 'This is not your average
21-year-old.' He has a chance to impress everybody, but instead he
thought about it that thoroughly. It was, well, it was a beautiful
thing." Asked about the incident, Ledger, who has played the instrument
for six years, said it was a simple matter of respect for the Aboriginal
people.
Ledger was as attracted to the story as Helgeland was to him. "It was
like, c'mon, I couldn't believe it. It was a smorgasbord of everything.
It was funny and sad and had all that action  it had a rich heartbeat
that went throughout the movie, which I really loved. And then just
meeting Brian and being on the same page. Sitting down and realizing we
had the same views of the movie. And he was a lovely, lovely guy. I just
wanted to work with him."
Before shooting started, the cast, which includes veteran performers
like "The Full Monty's" Mark Addy and newcomers like Shannyn Sossamon,
assembled at the location site in Prague for a month of rehearsals. The
cast dutifully practiced during the day, but spent most of their
evenings consuming a great deal of alcohol. "There was about three weeks
of drinking," said Ledger with a rakish grin. "The rest of the time was
horse riding and punching and swordplay; that sort of thing. Between the
work and the drinking, we bonded as a group. I think all the fun and the
friendship translates to the finished film."
For Ledger, the camaraderie was the best part of the experience and
wearing a suit of armor the worst. "You feel like the inside of a tin
can. It's very hot and very heavy. And it was kind of painful because
when you're riding a horse the armor bounces up and down on you." He
enjoyed his steed, though. "My horse Barney was so well trained. You
walk him over and show him the mark, then you go back and, when the time
comes, he goes right to it."
Unlike many young actors, Ledger avoided getting caught in teen movie
hell. After doing just one high school romantic comedy, he moved to a
pivotal supporting role in the prestigious Mel Gibson production and
then on to a starring role of his own. He claims not to have a formal
career plan, but agrees that he is selective. "My plan then was not to
make another teen movie, not to get caught in that. It's very easy, I
think, to fall into that trap. But I have to be selective. I'm stubborn
like that. I'm not happy unless I'm doing something I genuinely like.
That's reflected in the roles I pick. And I have to be scared; I have to
be worried going into it. I don't like it to be too easy. It has to test
you. I like to set hurtles in front of myself. That keeps it exciting."
His next film is another historical piece, "Four Feathers," where he
stars opposite Kate Hudson and Wes Bentley. Ledger has an affinity for
period movies, stating, "I guess the thing that interests me is the
characters from a hundred, 200 years ago. Emotions have evolved since
then, as well as the way we communicate, so you really have to go back
and get an understanding of where we came from and how we got to this
place now. It's curious  sometimes there's a fine line between our job
and being a shrink. Because you have to get in there and dig."
Ledger scoffed at a story referring to him as an old soul in a young
body.
"I'm a kid," he laughed, "I'm a total kid. I mean, you have to wizen up
a little bit professionally. I have to come in here and talk about
myself and go on about the movie, but inside I'm a 6-year old kid. In
some way that will never change and I think that's important. You have
to hold onto that."

A Knight's Tale is a shining example of why you shouldn't listen to rock
stars, because, contrary to what Robert Plant may have taught you, all that
Gary Glitters is not gold.  Plant was probably alive in the 14th century,
which is when Tale is set, but even he'd be shocked by what Brian Helgeland
decided would be a good idea for a summer movie - setting a jousting
tournament to songs that you'd hear blaring from an '86 Camaro full of guys
with perms on their way to pee in the sink at an NFL game after loading up
on Coors Light.
The good news is that nobody sings, but beyond that, you're on your own.
Based loosely on the first story in Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales," the
film begins just outside a jousting competition, where three peasants are
trying to decide what to do with their keeper, who has just expired as a
result of what we assume to be a jousting-related injury.  Despite the fact
that you need to be of noble descent to participate, William Thatcher (Heath
Ledger, The Patriot) dons the dead man's armor and finishes the tournament,
which features Queen's "We Will Rock You" as the audience claps, stomps and
does The Wave.
When Thatcher wins, he and his two mates - Roland (Mark Addy, Down to Earth)
and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 28 Days) - decide they'll joust for a month to make
some money before going their separate ways.  The trio befriends a naked
forgery expert - subtly named Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) - who provides
phony documents declaring Thatcher to be Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein (who
I'm pretty sure was a drummer for Spinal Tap at one point).
Thatcher proves to be a natural at jousting, a sport that doesn't really
translate into to much excitement on the screen.  While he captures the top
spot in several tournaments, Thatcher makes an enemy of Count Adhemar (Rufus
Sewell, Bless the Child) an undefeated jouster with crossed eyes, at the
same time falling in love with a Lady named Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon).  It
comes as no surprise to learn Adhemar is after the same woman, although it
is a little strange that Thatcher continues to pursue her, when he seems to
be a much better fit with a curvy blacksmith (Laura Fraser, Titus) who gives
him dancing lessons and makes him a new, ultra-light armor (complete with
Nike Swooshes...maybe it's supposed to be A Phil Knight's Tale).  C'mon, Sir
Ulrich - why go after an anorexic Gia-wannabe when you've got a much more
attractive girl sitting right next to you?
Tale's first two hours (yes, it's a 132-minute film about jousting) are all
a set-up for the big showdown between Thatcher and Adhemar at the World
Championships in London, which is somewhat of a homecoming for William as we
learn his origin via kooky childhood flashbacks.  The highlight of the film
comes when Chaucer, who is apparently an early ancestor of Michael Buffer,
introduces Thatcher before each jousting competition.  He's a brilliant,
fast-talking showman for what appears to be the equivalent of the WWF.
Writer/director Helgeland, probably best known for getting the heave-ho from
Mel Gibson after Payback completed filming (as opposed to the Oscar he won
for co-adapting L.A. Confidential), does nothing exciting or original with
the incredibly bland story...unless you count the inclusion of those classic
rock songs.  It's a bad idea that must have sounded as awful on paper as it
comes off on the screen.  Some of the songs make sense in relation to the
goings-on of the characters (like "The Boys Are Back In Town"), but most do
not (like "Low Rider").  The only song that didn't immediately make me slap
my hand to my forehead was Bowie's "Golden Years."
2:12 - PG-13 for action violence, some nudity and brief sex-related dialogue

One week, in DRIVEN, we have a bunch of pretty boys competing in fast 
cars, and a few weeks later, in A KNIGHT'S TALE, we retreat to the 
middle ages so a different set of good looking guys can joust together.  
This time, however, it is not just any heartthrob, but none other than 
cover boy Heath Ledger (10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU and THE PATRIOT) who 
plays the lead, William Thatcher.   Since peasants, like William, were 
unable to join in the fun on horseback, he takes on a pseudonym and 
pretends to be a knight.
As the evil and undefeated Count Adhemar, Rufus Sewell plays his usual 
hissable villain who will stoop to anything to win.  That he and William 
are destined to end up fighting for the world championship -- bet you 
didn't know they had them back then -- is obvious from the start.  Just 
as easy to guess is the story's big "twist."  
Shannyn Sossamon, as Jocelyn, plays the woman that both William and the 
Count want.  Jocelyn is a fickle female who likes to devise strange 
tests of a man's love.  Sossamon provides a nice smile but little else.
William's ace in the hole is one Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) -- 
"Chaucer's the name; writing's the game" -- who serves as William's 
personal rabble rousing announcer and poet-in-residence.  A wonderfully 
comic Bettany, acting like a boisterous frat house president at an Ivy 
League school, steals every scene he's in.  Although my female friends 
will probably disagree with me, Bettany's performance provides a much 
more convincing reason to see the movie than Ledger's looks.
The movie is at its the best when it's the most over the top, which, 
regretfully, isn't nearly often enough.  The first match, for example, 
has the medieval crowd singing and clapping, "We Will, We Will, Rock 
You!"  It's an exhilarating moment that literally rocks the house.  
While the knights are trying to knock each other off their mounts, the 
vendors work the assembled peasants and nobility, selling hot wine and 
other popular beverages.
The dialog is mainly modern, but writer Brian Helgeland, who also 
directs, throws in a few more authentic sounding lines as when William 
declares, "Love has given me wings so I must fly."
Between lively musical numbers from "The Boys Are Back In Town" and 
"Takin' Care Of Business," the movie features one jousting match after 
another until you begin to think that they completely forgot to edit the 
movie at all.  It just goes on and on, turning what should be an 
energetic tale into an endurance contest.  There's even a needless side 
story about William's blind father.  It all adds up to 40 minutes of 
bloat in a film that should have been released in a fighting trim.
A KNIGHT'S TALE runs a long 2:12.  It is rated PG-13 for action 
violence, some nudity and brief sex-related dialogue and would be 
acceptable for kids about 7 and up.
