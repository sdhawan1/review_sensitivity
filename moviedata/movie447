Antonio Banderas, fresh from his awkward performance in the disastrous
THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR, makes his inauspicious directorial debut in
CRAZY IN ALABAMA.  A cinematic hash of stale ingredients lifted from
other movies, CRAZY IN ALABAMA includes a wacky woman, a cheesy chase, a
racial rebellion, an aspiring actress and stupid-sounding Southerners.
It's a comedy that's not even close to being funny and a drama about the
civil rights movement that's not the least bit moving.
The picture, set in the summer of 1965, stars Banderas's real-life wife
Melanie Griffith as Lucille, a murderer with seven kids less than eight
years old -- her husband, she claims, kept putting holes in her
diaphragm.  She brags before the opening credits that she sliced off her
husband's head for saying no when he should have said yes.  She leaves
her brood with her mother and flies the coop, as she is chased by
incompetent cops.  Griffith seems to specialize these days in giving
clich√©d performances in roles that are already written as little more
than caricatures.
Lucille, who keeps her husband's severed head in her hatbox, wants to be
an actress, so she's off to Hollywood to seek her fame and fortune.
She's chosen Carolyn Clay as her stage name since it's "kind of like
Marilyn Monroe, only different."  Did I mention that the boxed head
talks to her?
Meanwhile, back at the local swimming pool, some "Negroes" are daring to
swim with the whites.  Prejudiced Sheriff John Doggett (Meat Loaf) stops
by to spout such classic lines as, "You got no rights in my town, boy."
The sheriff unintentionally kills one of the black boys when the boy
tries to escape.  The sheriff claims the boy fell and doesn't admit that
he was pulling him off of the fence at the time.
Lucille's nephew Peejoe (Lucas Black) is a 13-year-old who is troubled
by discrimination.  He complains to his Uncle Dove (David Morse) that
Negroes shouldn't be kept from registering to vote.  "You're right," his
uncle tells him.  "It's not fair.  It's just the way things are."
Peejoe ends up being a hero for telling the truth about the swimming
pool incident.
Mark Childress's script, based on his novel, is a treasure trove of
eclectic lines -- sometimes ponderously pretentious and other times
overly cute.  ("Life and death are only temporary, but freedom goes on
forever," Peejoe lectures us in voice-over.  "I just love the sounds of
an authentic peasant accent," a Hollywood socialite, played by Elizabeth
Perkins, says of Lucille's speech.)
Rod Steiger drops by towards the end to chew up the scenery as the local
judge.  Steiger tries without much luck to breathe life into the picture
by recasting it as an over-the-top parody.  In a movie that wastes vast
amounts of money authentically recreating the mid-1960s, why do they let
Steiger wear the same 1990s designer frames that he has in real-life?
When I met him earlier this year, he had on these exact glasses.
Does this abysmal movie have any saving grace?  Yes.  The dazzling,
vintage automobiles, like Lucille's cherry red 1964 Ford Galaxy, look so
new that you'd swear no one has ever ridden in them before.  The bright,
primary colored cars shine with the same radiance that they must have
given out on the day that they left the factory floor.  Enjoy them as
much as you can.  They're the best part of the production.
CRAZY IN ALABAMA runs a long 1:51.  It is rated PG-13 for some violence,
thematic material, language and a scene of sensuality and would be
acceptable for kids 10 and up.

Before he came to the United States. Antonio Banderas was a
star in Pedro Almodovar's sex comedies in Spain. So it's not
surprising that Banderas's first directorial effort reflects
Amodovar's style of directing, beginning with the opening credits
which are similar to "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and
"Dark Habits," and continuing with an amalgam of wacky whimsy and
genuine emotion throughout the narrative. Written by Mark Childress,
the film attempts to interweave two stories, set in 1965. One
chronicles the Civil Rights awakening of a young Southern boy called
Peejoe (Lucas Black), who lives in a funeral home with his mortician
uncle, and the second revolves around his zany, flamboyant Aunt
Lucille (Melanie Griffith, Banderas's real-life wife). As the tale
begins, Aunt Lucille decapitates her abusive husband, puts his head in
a hatbox, and sets off to pursue her dream of a show biz career in
Hollywood - just as Peejoe sees the sheriff (Meat Loaf Aday) kill a
black boy during a protest at a segregated municipal swimming
pool. Will Peejoe tell the truth to the authorities - or cover up the
crime? That's his moral dilemma. And will Lucille be convicted of
murder? All the various story elements come together in a big
court-room finale, dominated by the gavel of an eccentric judge (Rod
Steiger). The problem is that the shrill, farcical humor of Aunt
Lucille distracts from the intimate drama of the teenager's coming to
terms with bigotry and racial prejudice in his own hometown. And one
simply cannot ignore Melanie Griffith's incongruous jet-black wig and
scarlet, collagen-infused lips. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Crazy in Alabama" is a fanciful if uneven 5, offering a few lively
moments of clever insight.

     I spent much of CRAZY IN ALABAMA trying to figure out the connection
between its two largely parallel storylines.  I spent much of the rest of
the time surprised how little I cared.  And I spent the final ten minutes
marvelling how quickly a pleasant little film can turn ghastly.  Adapted
by Mark Childress from his own novel and directed by erstwhile Zorro
Antonio Banderas, CRAZY IN ALABAMA takes us back to 1965 in the small town
of Industry (accent on the second syllable), Alabama.  Our narrator is
Peter Joseph "Peejoe" Bullis (Lucas Black), a 13-year-old orphan living
with his grandmother.  Life is turned upside down when Peejoe's Aunt
Lucille (Melanie Griffith) announces to her mother that she has killed and
decapitated her abusive husband, and that she's leaving her six children
behind while she flees to Hollywood to become a star.  Meanwhile, back in
Industry, the influx of kids sends Peejoe and his brother Wiley to live
with Uncle Dove (David Morse), the segregated town's mortician for whites. 
Soon Peejoe becomes aware of racial unrest stirring in the town, and
becomes an eyewitness to the extreme response of Sheriff John Doggett 
(Meat Loaf Aday).
     I must confess that I kept forgiving CRAZY IN ALABAMA its excess just
because it was so unexpectedly weird at times, primarily in the
Lucille-on-the-lam segments.  Melanie Griffith is an eccentric hoot as
Lucille, carrying around her husband's head in a Tupperware container
because she wants him around to see her make it as an actress.  Her
adventures are so ridiculous it's hard not to smile.  She seduces a cop
and leaves him handcuffed to his own jail cell.  She wins $13,000 playing
roulette in Las Vegas.  She turns the hostess (a splendidly uptight
Elizabeth Perkins) at a Hollywood party into a catatonic mess with hubby's
strategically-placed noggin.  She even does a guest spot on "Bewitched," 
reading her lines to toneless stand-ins for Sam, Darrin and company.  The
story keeps hopping in so many directions, zestfully directed by Banderas,
that it's almost impossible to lose interest for long.
     It also hops back in the direction of Peejoe's story, where
strangeness generally gives way to sluggish sincerity.  CRAZY IN ALABAMA
plays its racial themes deadly straight, turning Peejoe into a
preternaturally wise and moral lad who even gets to shake Dr. Martin
Luther King's hand.  In more ways than one, it's all black and white --
the buffoonishly nasty sheriff, the calmly liberal father figure, the
noble African-American protesters whose plight is rendered in grainy
newsreel-style footage.  Everyone carries on in the expected ways on the
expected subjects, all leading to the one-would-hope-obvious conclusion
that segregation was a very bad thing indeed, and thank heaven for a few
good white people to help set things right.
     Still, the zestful style of the Lucille storyline makes it possible
to get past the heavy-handedness of the Peejoe storyline ... until Lucille
returns to Industry.  Thus is set in motion one of the most painful
courtroom finales in cinema's long, sad history of painful courtroom
finales, presided over by Rod Steiger as the judicial equivalent of
Col. Kurtz.  First Lucille tells her tale of woe to the jury, rambling on
about the horrors of domestic abuse for reasons too contrived to fathom.
You'd suspect it was a matter of Banderas indulging his real-life leading
lady, if not for the fact that Steiger follows Lucille's monologue with a
rant of his own.  Banderas loses complete control over his actors at the
film's conclusion.  Worse yet, the film takes two sensitive issues -- the
subjugation of African-Americans and the subjugation of women -- and, in
attempting to equate them, doesn't do justice to either one.  It's a
tragic miscalculation in a film which at least had a chance when it was
quirky and frivolous.  The real craziness in CRAZY IN ALABAMA is that a
viewer might spend so much time giving it the benefit of the doubt.

CrankyCritic≈Ω movie reviews: Crazy in Alabama
Rated [PG-13], 104 minutes
Starring Melanie Griffith, David Morse, Lukas Black
Screenplay by Mark Childress, based on his novel
Directed by Antonio Banderas
website: www.crazyinalabama.com
IN SHORT: Good work from Melanie Griffith. Decent first flick from
Antonio Banderas, director.
Juxtapose one very serious story about a child witnessing a racial
murder in 1965 Alabama with a quirky story of his homicidal aunt's
journey to Hollywood, where fame and a TV career await, and you've got
actor Antonio Banderas' directorial debut Crazy in Alabama in a
nutshell. How one story influences the events of the other is so subtle
that Cranky didn't get it. Both stories, individually, are good in and
of themselves. So let's get to them.
Melanie Griffith hasn't gotten the great character roles all that often
in her career but when she gets a good one, as she does here, she goes
to town. As Lucille, a would be actress who gets a call from the coast,
nothing is going to keep her from obtaining her dream. Not the seven
kids. Not the abusive husband who, before the film even begins, is
beheaded and stuffed in a freezer. Lucille (Griffith), character that
she is, takes the head with her as she drops off the kids and says
good-bye to her best nephew, Peejoe (Lucas Black) who, in the round
robin or restructured families, is shuffled off to live with another
uncle, Dove (David Morse).
The setting allows for PeeJoe's story to focus on the racial strife of
the time, which includes the usual redneck sheriff (Meat Loaf Aday) who,
in the course of beating up some black kids who wanted to swim at the
public pool, accidentally kills one. PeeJoe is the only witness but
Sheriff Doggett, still after Lucille for the (now) discovered killing,
is not beyond making some sort of deal to keep his fat butt free.
Lucille's cross country trek paves the way for lots of small scenes of
interactions with "real" people across the heartland. The girl can flirt
her way out of trouble and, by the time she hits LA, she's got an agent
(Robert Wagner) and a handful of men in her thrall. She still has that
head, by the way, which speaks to her regularly.
Eventually, both stories come back together in a courtroom run by Rod
Steiger. His judge is a total cartoon, and would work well up against
teevee's Judge Judy, but Crazy in Alabama is, at heart, a light flick.
Two good stories. Good performances. Easy to rate...
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Crazy in Alabama, he would have
paid...

Crazy in Alabama is an 'I learned a lot of secrets that summer' movie,
in-line with Stand by Me and all the Stand by Me pretenders. Which is to say
it's retrospective, nostalgic, voiced-over, all that. And, as it's set in
the summer of 1965, any ritual growing up that's done is of course a growing
up into 'America,' a harsh realization of what 'America' means. Setting the
movie in Alabama is simply economical, as it allows easier access to all the
racial turmoil which defined America in the 1960s. It also gives Lucas
Black--Peejoe in the movie--license to get thick and heavy with Southern
dialect, which he does as well as anybody and better than most.
It opens as any ritual growing-up movie has to: with him being a kid, in the
country, still clinging to his illusions, etc, all of which has to change
almost immediately. It does. Enter his Aunt Lucille (Melanie Griffith), on
the run from murder charges, telling him the 'secrets' of the murder she's
committed. Which is to say that instead of treating him like a kid, she's
functioning as the catalyst to his coming of age cycle here. Up to this
point--and if you can ignore the oddly dissonant, comical credit sequence up
front--Crazy in Alabama is a coherent movie, but as soon as Lucille
confesses to Peejoe, it quickly falls apart, or, perhaps tries to thematize
the racial division of the times via dividing itself into two movies.
The first movie is pretty much a solo Thelma and Louise: Lucille, trekking
across the country to be a starlet in Hollywood, her list of charges growing
longer with every stop. Granted, Crazy in Alabama does add a talking head
(the husband she murdered) to the mix, and does have Lucille pull off in
Vegas what Woody and Demi couldn't in Indecent Proposal, but still, it's all
about a woman doing away with paternalistic social constraints and cutting
loose for awhile. Period.
The second movie is a little better, as it contains the character who's
supposed to 'develop' here, Peejoe, something of a mix between Huck Finn and
Forrest Gump. Which is to say he's naive enough that all this racism he
finds himself thrust in the middle of simply doesn't make sense. Sum: he
sees too well. Result: he loses an eye. Simple stuff. And of course there's
Meat Loaf as racist Sheriff Doggett (see the Sheriff in the 1990 Night of
the Living Dead for the same character), Peejoe's mortal enemy. And of
course Crazy in Alabama does make a meager effort to causally tie Lucille's
story together with Peejoe's, but it's so heavy-handed and predictable that
it winds up being a bit more anticlimactic than is really needed at the
moment.
Crazy in Alabama does have its moments though, like when Taylor Jackson
dies, how in the unfocused background there's a bird flying up. Or Lucille's
whole Cinderella-in-Hollywood trip, where everything matters because we know
when that clock strikes twelve, she's got to cash it all in. Too, the whole
thing is almost salvaged by one supporting character--Judge Mead (Rod
Steiger)--easily the best performance in the movie, even if he is caught in
a courtroom which exists wherever To Kill a Mockingbird and Time to Kill
intersect. But he is just one character, and there's really too much wrong
in Crazy in Alabama for him to compensate for. As a movie about growing up
in the racial turmoil of the 1960s, it might have succeeded--there's some
good material there--but as is, there's another movie edited in, and it's
difficult to tell which is supposed to be primary.

The human mind spends a lot of time trying to make sense of things. We devote
an amazing amount of energy sifting through chaos, trying to find the
patterns. It's why optical illusions work. It's why everyone has their own
ideas of how life works.
The idea that there is no pattern, no "why," is so alien that we reject it. We
need order and connections, even if they are illusions.
Attempting to find the connections between the two stories in "Crazy In
Alabama" is not only a fool's errand, but it ruins what might have otherwise
been an acceptable little film.
Lucille (Melanie Griffith) is fed up with her cruel controlling husband. He
beats her. He's kept her pregnant for years by punching holes in her
diaphragm. She's so tired of him that when he tells her she can't go to
Hollywood to pursue her dream of stardom, she poisons him and cuts off his
head with her electric carving knife.
She stuffs his body in the family freezer, drops off her seven young kids at
mama's house and hits the road for sunny California with poor hubby's head in
a Tupperware container by her side.
Back at mama's place, the influx of youngsters forces her to move Peejoe
(Lucas Black) and his brother, orphaned grandsons she has been raising, to
their uncle Dove's (David Morse).
Living in the small town of Industry, Peejoe soon comes face-to-face with the
racial unrest that was Alabama in 1965. When Sheriff Doggett (Meat Loaf Aday)
kills a black teen trying to swim in a public pool, Peejoe becomes radicalized
to the plight of Negroes.
So there you have it. Zany Lucille is driving to the big city on a one-woman
"Thelma And Louise" trek to strike it big and 13-year-old Peejoe is immersed
in the civil rights movement. What's the connection?
Sure there are some thematic similarities. Women and Blacks have been kept
down for centuries and both are beginning to awaken. But Lucille's half of the
film is played for laughs and Peejoe's is deadly serious. Although the film
was adapted from Mark Childress' novel, it doesn't work as one story. It feels
like the studio had two completely different tales and stapled the scripts together.
The frustration is that either could have been a satisfying film. Lucille's
search for self identity and fame has some hilarious moments. Peejoe coming of
age in the turbulent sixties is often poignant.
Either story could have worked. Not both.
It's too bad. Watching the film, trying to fit the two together, I kept making
excuses because there are so many good scenes. I kept hoping that it would all
fall together in the end. Ultimately it doesn't.
Actor Antonio Banderas' directoral debut takes a few more wrong steps than
just the juxtaposition of the mis-matched plots. Both have some problems. The
decapitated head talking to Lucille is neither funny nor entertaining. The
depiction of the plight of oppressed people told through white eyes is an
overworked error.
Griffith has played this part a number of times before and often succeeds,
especially in her "I'm so sexy you can't stand it" scenes. Unfortunately she
occasionally appears disconnected from her character.
Black is grand as the homegrown southern kid. His role here rivals his
performance as the trusting boy in "Slingblade". Kids who come across as real
children on the screen are rare. He does it to perfection.
A few of the supporting characters are strong also. Morse turns in a good
understated job as the liberal mortician. Meat Loaf's redneck sheriff is fun
to watch, cliched as it is. Rod Steiger show up as a judge at the courtroom
finale. He almost seems like he's in a different film than the rest of the
cast, but adds a touch of energy.
Wait until this comes out on video. Then do your own editing, putting the
scenes from each story together and watch it that way. You'll have two
acceptable short films rather than one longer one that just doesn't work.

Antonio Banderas' directorial debut. Whoop-dee-doo! Melanie Griffith
starring in the role of a wannabee movie actress. Harumph...whatta stretch!
Rod Steiger?!! Yikes! These were all the things going through my head as I
approached the viewing of this film. Admittedly, I was not excited to see
this movie. One of the few films that I see for the sake of my movie
criticism. Having said all that, Banderas' directing was top-notch, Griffith
pulled out one of her better roles in years and Steiger, well Steiger,
you'll have to read on to find out.
PLOT:
Set in the 1960s, a mother of six children murders her husband in cold blood
after 13 years of mistreatment and heads out to Hollywood to take a shot at
the big-time. Meanwhile, her favorite nephew Peejoe is left back home with
some of her secrets and a dilemma, after he sees the local sheriff kill an
innocent black youth.
CRITIQUE:
This film combines various elements from a handful of other films, beginning
with a solo THELMA & LOUISE theme, and actually manages to meche all of the
different situations into a cohesive whole by the way of interesting
characters, a sharp eye and direction from Antonio Banderas and a
captivating performance by Melanie Griffith. Thank God, she actually plays
something other than an airhead bimbo in this one! I also enjoyed the way it
was shot with both stories intercrossing one another all the way through
with overall effectiveness. I think the most credit has to be given to the
director in this case, who was able to juggle the two plot lines with great
aplomb, and bring out solid performances from all of his players. I thought
that both the kid and Melanie stood out in the cast, despite my initial
mixed reaction to his strong accent. Add to that an excellent ensemble of
supporting actors, including the always effective David Morse, the
surprising Meatloaf and the scene-stealing antics of the 'contender's brothe
r, Rod Steiger.
Now when you consider that I wanted nothing to do with this film before
actually seeing it, my recommendation should carry even more weight (At
least to those who care : ). One thing which does worry me about this film,
is the fact that it might never find a real target audience and get lost in
the shuffle of this weekend's five opening films. If so, be sure to catch
this movie on video because it really does offer many telling lessons on
love, persistence and freedom. And even if you're not interested in these
messages, you should at least try to see it because of the extremely
well-handled directorial debut of Antonio Banderas, a strong performance
from his wife, Melanie, and a hilarious supporting role by Rod Steiger, who
takes the ball and runs with it! Not a major motion picture, but definitely
one that ought to be savored as a major surprise.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Antonio Banderas has been married to the star of this film, Melanie
Griffith, since 1996. His full name is Jos√© Antonio Dom√≠nguez Banderas.
Griffith has been married four times in her life, including two separate
occasions to the same man, Miami Vice's Don Johnson. Her first husband,
Steven Bauer, played Al Pacino's good buddy Manny, in 1987's SCARFACE. They
had a kid together named Alexander. The character which Griffith's mom Tippi
Hedren played in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller THE BIRDS, was named
Melanie. Her half-sister Tracy Girffith makes a cameo appearance in this
film as well.
Actor/singer Meatloaf's real name is Marvin Lee Aday. He has been married to
the same woman since 1975. Her name is Leslie. Her name is Leslie. Her name
is Leslie. According to director Banderas, three lines into Meat Loaf's
reading of the script, he knew that he was the actor whom he was looking
for.
You might remember the teenage kid in this film, Lucas Black, from his role
as Frank Wheatley, the "kid" from Billy Bob Thorton's SLING BLADE. He claims
to want to be a bass fisherman when he grows older.
Cathy Moriarty made her feature film debut at the age of 18 in Martin
Scorsese's RAGING BULL opposite Robert DeNiro. When not before the camera,
Moriarty can be found in Beverly Hills or Encino working at one of the three
locations of Mulberry Street Pizzeria, which she owns.
Actor David Morse stands 6'5".
This film is based on the novel written by Mark Childress, the same man who
adapted it to the screen for this film.

1999 - 104 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for mild violence and profanity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, October 26, 1999.
Over the years, there have been innumerable films made about the Civil Rights 
movement of the 1960s, to the point where a filmmaker couldn't possibly say 
anything that hasn't already been said before. With that noted, "Crazy in 
Alabama" doesn't have any original insights into the era, nor is it 
particularly well-handled in that arena. Fortunately, we virtually get two 
45-minute movies that interweave between one another, until they come 
together in the climax, and the other story is the one that sparkles.
Based on the novel by Mark Childress, this comedy-drama, set in the summer of 
1965 in the Deep South, makes no excuses for its eccentricities, as Lucille 
(Melanie Griffith), a 34-year-old housewife with seven children, tells her 
mother (Sandra Seacat) even before the opening credits that she not only 
poisoned her husband, but decapitated him. Wacky, but otherwise not 
dangerous, Lucille did what she did because her abusive marriage was 
suffocating her, and she has no regrets. Leaving her kids with her mother, 
Lucille, and with her husband's head in tow, sets off for Hollywood to become 
what she's always dreamt of being--an actress. But not so fast, because as 
Lucille's story plays out, the film is narrated by her nephew, Peejoe (Lucas 
Black), a 13-year-old who admires his Aunt Lucille to no end, and is sent 
away to live with his loving uncle (David Morse) and narrow-minded aunt 
(Cathy Moriarty) for the summer. While at the city's public swimming pool, he 
briefly meets another kid (Louis Miller Jr.) just a few years older than he 
before witnessing him later thrown from a fence by the crooked sheriff (Meat 
Loaf Aday) after banishing him from the pools because of his race. The kid 
dies, the sheriff claims he never touched him, but Peejoe knows the truth, 
and doesn't want him to get away with it. Meanwhile, as Lucille garners a 
guest spot on the television show, "Bewitched," she senses that the police 
are soon going to close in on her.
While the story of Peejoe, as he learns several life lessons about the 
importance of equality and tolerance, feels rather by-the-numbers and 
predictable, "Crazy in Alabama" ultimately works due to the unforgettable 
character of Lucille, played by Melanie Griffith in her first truly 
worthwhile starring role since 1991's "Paradise." Griffith is often 
criticized for playing the ditzy blond with the childish, high voice, and 
those detractors of her work have always mystified me. While she may not 
always make the right career moves, Griffith is a wonderful actress who can 
effortlessly play both comedy and drama, and some people seem to forget that 
she was nominated for an Academy Award in 1988 for her breakthrough role in 
"Working Girl." "Crazy in Alabama" plays up both sides of her acting talent, 
and she steals the film away from everyone else within the first five 
minutes. Just take a look at the sequence midway through in which Lucille is 
talking on the phone with Peejoe, and after he asks her if she's alright, she 
replies, "Yes, I'm alright. I'm free! For the first time in my entire life I 
am free!" Griffith says the words with such effervescent life that it's 
obvious she is a performer who loves what she does, and is instantly charming.
As her counterpart, Lucas Black gives another effective, understated 
performance after his role in 1996's "Sling Blade." If the subplot about the 
wrongful murder of the black child, and Peejoe's struggle to let people know 
the truth concerning his death, is cliched, at least Black is able to create 
a character that is worth following, even when the plot surrounding him isn't.
Both characters end up together for a climactic trial, after Lucille has been 
arrested, and my heart almost sank. After all, did we really need to have to 
sit through another stock courtroom scene? Luckily, it worked, managing to 
pull both laughs and bittersweet truth out of the matters at hand, and never 
went sappy like so many films of its ilk usually do. On the downside, the 
picture ends before the other subplot, involving the crime that the sheriff 
commits, is solved, and so we are left hanging by a plot thread that we had 
just dedicated 45 minutes of our time with. 
"Crazy in Alabama" is helmed by actor Antonio Banderas, making his directing 
debut, and even when the film smells of the word, "amateur," Banderas can 
rest assured that, in a week which saw six major film releases, he made one 
out of only two movies that I liked (the other being Martin Scorsese's 
masterful "Bringing Out the Dead"). The premise may not sound like the most 
probable choice for someone from a foreign country, but Banderas proves that 
you can successfully make a film that doesn't relate directly to you, simply 
if the underlying themes are felt deeply enough.

Antonio Banderas' directorial debut is surprisingly solid as he
assembles an eclectic cast in an adaptation of Mark Childress' novel of
the same name.  Banderas has wisely chosen material that isn't
autobiographical for his first feature, eliminating concern that Crazy
in Alabama would be like the work of other actor-turned-directors, most
recently Frank Whaley's Joe the King. Alabama features two odd plots
that are tied together with a big courtroom finale and one central
character.
Set in the summer of 1965, Alabama is narrated by Peejoe (Lucas Black,
Slingblade) ¬ñ short for Peter Joseph ¬ñ a young boy in a small town that
still hasn't been notified of the Emancipation Proclamation.  As the
film opens, his oddball Aunt Lucille (Melanie Griffith, Another Day in
Paradise) tells Peejoe that she has killed her husband of thirteen years
and father of her seven children.  Lucille used rat poison to kill her
victim ¬ñ because `that's what you use when you want to kill a rat' ¬ñ
before decapitating him with an electric knife and leaving his remains
in a basement freezer as she squeals out of town to the strains of
`These Boots are Made for Walking.'  She is an aspiring actress who
dreams of landing a gig on Bewitched and heads for Los Angeles to pursue
her unlikely goal.
Peejoe, who had previously lived with his Aunt Lucille, is shipped off
to live with his Uncle Dove (David Morse, The Negotiator), a soft-spoken
funeral director.  As summer heats up, so does the tension in the still
racially segregated small town.  Peejoe witnesses the murder of a black
youth that had merely used the white-only pool facilities.  The fact
that the murder was committed by Sheriff John Doggett (Meat Loaf, Fight
Club) inspires Peejoe to speak out publicly about racial injustice.
Black couldn't look more like a hillbilly, but Peejoe has a perpetual
look of surprise when he watches the actions of his community.
Although the film seems a little choppy at first because of the
transition between the racism and Lucille plots, the picture is very
well paced.  One storyline takes a depressing look at an ugly portion of
American history and the other is almost like a fable, with Lucille
stealing a car in New Orleans, busting out of jail in Texas, breaking
the bank in Las Vegas and eventually hitting it big in Hollywood.  The
big courtroom finale that ties the two together is pretty well done,
with only Griffith's weepy monologue seeming a bit too much.  The judge
is played by Rod Steiger, who was either drunk or had never seen his
lines before.  Another possibility for his odd acting was that Banderas
filmed a rehearsal without Stieger's knowledge.
Griffiths does quite a decent job tackling the role of Lucille.  With
her long legs, black hair, big red lips and blue eyes she looks like she
could be the mother of Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron, if they were
sisters (and wouldn't you have loved to live next door to that family).
Her Lucille is plagued by the voice of her decapitated husband
throughout the film, most likely on account of carrying his head around
in a hat box the entire time. Cathy Moriarty (Gloria), Richard Schiff
(The West Wing), John Beasley (The General's Daughter), Robert Wagner
(Austin Powers) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show) round out this
bizarre cast.
1:55 - PG-13 for violence, thematic material, language and adult

This is not a movie for film buffs, or movie buffs, or film fans.  This
is a movie for film *freaks*, those who love not only what is best in
movies but also what is worst.  The reviews didn't begin to plumb the
depths of what is dreadful about this movie.  This movie may have a great
future as a midnight feature in cities like San Francisco where there are
many movie freaks.  It is one of those movies that will come up over and
over again in conversations in bars where people say, "Do you remember X,
with A and B in it?  It was SOOO bad!"  
It is TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD meets screwball comedy, with occasional
touches of Ed Wood (PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE and GLEN OR GLENDA) and
Pedro Almodovar.  Roger Ebert's review points out the most conspicuous
flaw (oh, I need I much stronger word than this here) in the conception
of this film.  You *cannot* make a movie in which a woman in an
appalling black wig (Melanie Griffith, no less) carries around the head
of the husband she has murdered in a hatbox and hears it talking to her
(other people occasionally hear it too) and, in the same movie, have a
civil rights theme in which a teenage Black protestor gets killed by a
Southern sheriff.  You *cannot* do this.  You *must not* do this.
Anybody who has been to film school knows this.  Anybody who has sat in
lots of theatres on Saturday nights knows this.  There is nothing funny
about Blacks getting killed protesting segregation.  You cannot make
this the major subplot of a zany comedy and keep jumping back and forth
between the two plots.
This movie is directed by Anthonio Banderas, who happens to be Melanie
Griffith's husband.  How else could a director convince an Academy Award
winning actress, a beautiful woman who I have always loved ever since I
first saw her in Jonathan Demme's film SOMETHING WILD, to put on a one of
the world's worst wigs and dress in clothes that represent California
supermarket couture at its worst and play the lead in a movie where one
of the big jokes is that everyone in the movie thinks that this woman is
beautiful whereas in fact she is the ugliest trashy divorcee one might
ever expect to come across in Santa Monica or Waikiki?  
Jennifer Jason Leigh (another of my favorite actresses) could have been
right at home with this role.  But Melanie Griffith?  Melanie Griffith???
I mean, really!
There have been many instances in movie history of directors making
movies to give their wife or girlfriend the chance to for a sort of
starrring role they could never have got otherwise.  But here we have
the opposite case, where an Academy-award winning actress is willing to
make a sacrifice bunt in order to give her husband's first attempt at
directing some chance of success.
This is one of those movies where one just throws everything in the pot
that happens to be in the refrigerator.  It's one of those movies where
the entire point is for the director (and producers) to prove that they
are actually capable of making a movie and completing it.  Whether it's
any good or not is a luxury the makers clearly couldn't afford to worry
about.
Roger Ebert's review quotes a few of the really atrocious lines from the
screenplay.  The sheriff at the swimming pool that the Black teenagers
are trying to integrate says, "You are trespassing on public property."
Clearly this line was intended to be funny, but given the situation, one
has no inclination to laugh.  In Melanie Griffith's completely bizarre
courtroom speech at the end, she justifies having murdered her husband by
saying, among other things, "You spend all day making a beautiful meal
for your husband and he comes home and gobbles it down and a little piece
of you dies."  To which Ebert comments, "Yeah, and big piece of him
does."  
But I was disappointed that Ebert, who, after all, wrote the screenplay
for BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, did not notice all the myriad ways
in which the script for this movie is gloriously dreadful.  This movie is
camp at its best.  Not camp that self-consciously sets out to be camp,
but camp made with complete seriousness.  
I was tempted to walk out after the first half hour of this film,
something which I never do.  But there are some beautiful outdoor scenes
--- something which is pretty much inevitable in any movie shot in
Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana.  And if you stay with the film and
give up being a critic and just let yourself have fun, by the end I
think you'll find that in its own way it has its charm.  I was glad I saw
it while I had the chance.
