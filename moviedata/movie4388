  On Sunday night, April 2nd, at 8 p.m., Showtime premieres a
made-for-television character study of the final years of Panamanian
General Manuel "Tony" Noriega's reign. Bob Hoskins stars as the
cunning and clever, yet desperate and dangerous dictator - and the
resemblance is eerie. And Hoskins is talented enough to embody all the
contradictions of Noriega's character, a man who believed in voodoo
and claimed to be a Buddhist yet kept Hitler's picture next to a
statue of the Virgin Mary, whose heroes included Moammar Kadafi and
Mother Teresa, who tortured and killed people yet refused to eat meat
because he opposed the slaughter of animals. Born out of wedlock, he
was abandoned by his mother when he was just five, forced to fend for
himself on the streets of Panama.  Convinced that he was God's
favorite and blessed with manic energy, Noriega not only survived but
succeeded in acquiring more power than anyone else in his
country. Scarred and pock-marked, he was an ugly strongman who
suffered under the tyranny of beautiful women.  Written by journalist
Lawrence Wright and directed by Roger Spottiswoode, this is a
speculative biography, since it deals with events no outsider ever
witnessed, examining the complications under the volatile surface,
bypassing the headlines and the stereotypes. Certainly Noriega is a
despicable thug, yet he's wickedly intriguing, not unlike other
Central American dictators who consider themselves victims of
U.S. foreign policy. On the Granger Made-for-TV Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, Noriega is an enigmatic 8.  And the real Noriega is still in
prison outside Miami, serving a 40-year sentence for racketeering,
conspiracy, and cocaine-smuggling. But he's up for parole this year
and - with his government influence - who knows?
