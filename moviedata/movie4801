>From the opening bloodletting scene, to the moment I walked out
(something I've never done before), there was a lingering feeling of
nausea - brought on by the sickening nature of this sordid movie. The
feel of dead bodies, morgues, necrophilia and lingering smell of
formalin-pickled anatomy parts, left a bitter taste - not your average
cup of tea. I hated anatomy and medical school left me with bad memories
of a stale, dark museum  resulting in a low tolerance for this sort of
movie. Feeling run down from a hard days work (equals - not in mood for
psychopathic killer on mad sexual rampage, killing prostitutes), was
probably another reason why I left early.
I laughed at KISS THE GIRLS, I shrugged my shoulders with indifference
to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and ignored most of the
grotesqueness of the SCREAMS, but I could not tolerate NIGHT WATCH. It
crossed that unseen barrier of acceptability. There were two others who
made an earlier departure than I, so clearly I was not alone in how I
felt.
>From what I did watch (about half the movie), the story revolves around
a night watch man (Ewan McGregor) who works part time at a morgue, in
order to supplement his income whilst studying. His best friend (Josh
Brolin) starts to show psychopathic tendencies early on. He keeps going
on about reaching highs'  and I don't mean drugs. Sex doesn't do it
for him', neither do prostitutes, he is unexcited with fighting, leaving
him with a void that needs to be filled. When he asks his best friend
(McGregor) to sleep with his girlfriend, so he can get turned on 
warning bells startedto ring. In this trend, it is hinted that the
psychotic bastard only gets a rush when he's murdering prostitutes. One
can only imagine what he does with the body after! This movie is like
Jeffrey Dharma revisited and is best avoided all together. It exploits
the darker side of human nature, a territory that is best left in the
unexplored realm of hell.
The only regrets I have is, watching talents like Patricia Arquette and
Ewan McGregor wasted on such poor material. After, A LIFE LESS ORDINARY,
Ewan McGregor has only himself to blame for choosing bad roles.
Hopefully, his upcoming performance as the young Obe-Wan Kenobe, in
George Lucas' STAR WARS pre-quels will be a redeeming feature - May the
force be with you Ewan.'

Nightwatch is finally coming out.  This film has been scheduled for
release more often than I masturbate.  It's never a good thing when a
studio continuously delays an opening, but they had a good reason to
with this one.  The procrastination was presumably due to last minute
attempts to somehow edit Ewan's cock into the picture.  He loves to
display his meats.  That's just my theory, but until somebody comes up
with another one, we'll just stick with mine.
A remake of Bordenal's allegedly superior Portuguese film (called
Nattevagten), Nightwatch follows the poor employment choice of law
student Martin (Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting).  Martin takes what he
thinks will be an easy gig - as a night watchman at the city morgue.
Even Catherine and James (Patricia Arquette and Josh Brolin, Flirting
with Disaster), his whiny girlfriend and whack-job best friend, can't
persuade Martin that it is way too creepy while Martin is convinced that
it will be easier to get his studying done in the ultra-quiet confines
on his new employer.
On his first day, Martin is given a quick, but funny, walk through of
his job responsibilities, courtesy of the crusty old guy who previously
held the position.  Now, I don't know how a real morgue works, but there
are apparently the magical keys spread all about the morgue.  In an
attempt to prove that he's actually patrolling the place, the watchman
has to take this lock-box thing around to the keys in a bizarre hourly
Easter egg-like hunt.  Of course, one of these keys is in the room where
they keep the bodies.  When Martin is told to be careful because the
door doesn't open from the inside, you can only imagine what will happen
on the last reel.  The cadaver room also has these creepy white
pull-cords that hang down from the ceiling, which are evidently used in
case someone mistakenly brings a living person in.  Just the fact that
this ever happens kind of creeps me out.
Anyway, Martin finds himself caught up in this stupid paint-by-number
rape/murder mystery.  Did I mention that he is the dumbest law student
since JFK, Jr.?  The smartest thing Martin does is comparing his
situation with a USA network movie.  You're not too far off, pal.  It
does boast a powerhouse collection of hip modern rock songs.  Songs that
you just don't hear on the USA.
Nightwatch does have a terrific dark and gritty look to it, similar to
last year's disappointment Mimic, which Bordenal produced and
Cinematographer Dan Laustsen shot.  The story is a big letdown,
especially coming from Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies & videotape).  The
identity of the killer is fairly obvious pretty early on, unlike the
current sexy thriller, Wild Things.

         Conventional wisdom says any film that spends an inordinantly
long amount of time on the shelf between its production and its
release must be a piece of junk.
  To get an idea of how long ``Nightwatch'' has been on hold,
please note the trailer for it was attached first to ``Scream'' in
December 1996 and then to ``Scream 2'' last Christmas.
  Astonishingly, the movie turns out to be a stylish little
horror show that's certainly better than most of its kind.
  The film is a remake by Danish director Ole Bornedal of his
own ``Nattevagten,'' a sizable hit abroad that has rarely been seen in
America.  A very boyish-looking Ewan McGregor plays Martin, a law
student who takes a job as a night watchman in a decrepit Los Angeles
morgue.
  Business there is brisk, since a serial killer is butchering
prostitutes and taking their eyes as trophies. Inspector Cray (Nick
Nol-te) is not-so-hot on the case.
  As the bodies pile up, Martin eventually becomes a suspect
in the slayings, but more likely culprits include a pill-popping
doctor (Brad Dourif), the unbalanced former security guard (Lonny
Chapman) and even Martin's misogynistic best friend James (Josh
Brolin), a twisted character who delights in manipulating and
degrading the opposite sex.
  Frankly, women don't fare too well in ``Nightwatch,'' and
Bornedal's tendency to linger on images of abuse taints the picture as
a whole. A restaurant scene featuring Martin and a down-and-out
prostitute engaging in behavior that might make even George Michael
blush is intended to be humorous, but comes off as crass exploitation.
  The palpable erotic vibe between Martin and James, on the
other hand, seems like something Bornedal and co-writer Steven
Soderbergh may not have intended: The looks James and Martin exchange
are ripe with suggestiveness, and when James pressures Martin into
fooling around with a hooker James has already slept with, it feels
like a sex-by-proxy situation.
  What a decent-enough guy like Martin is doing hanging around
with such a cretin is the movie's real mystery, much more difficult to
figure out than the identity of the murderer.
  Bornedal seems to have been more intrigued by Martin's
adjustment to life in the morgue, and the director makes excellent use
of the Cinemascope frame and some disturbing sound effects (such as
the amplified flapping of moths' wings) to show how our hero is
overwhelmed by his cold, spacious workplace.
  In addition to creating an often unnerving atmosphere - even
in its climax, which turns out to be exciting and absurd at the same
time - ``Nightwatch'' is also notable as another one of the
charismatic McGregor's quirky performances.
  Though he struggles at times to suppress his Scottish
accent, McGregor delights in capturing Martin's odd little details,
such as the way his nose sweats when he's tense.
  Brolin is memorably loathsome but Nolte and Patricia
Arquette, as Martin's lover, are greatly underused and photographed so
unmercifully they look ready for the morgue themselves.

     I have no objection to violence and gore in the movies -- even 
extreme violence and gore -- as long as it serves a purpose (see 
GOODFELLAS, PULP FICTION, and even SCREAM for examples).  In NIGHTWATCH, 
however, the most explicit and extreme instances of bloodletting are 
designed exclusively to titillate or horrify, depending on the viewer's 
tolerance and point-of-view.  Apparently, director Ole Bornedal 
(remaking his own 1994 Danish hit, NATTEVAGTEN) recognized how thin and 
contrived his script was, and attempted to plug the holes with something 
warm, wet, and sticky.  As either a slasher/horror flick or a murder 
mystery/thriller, NIGHTWATCH is a failure.
     The film's distribution history -- or lack thereof -- is a tip-off 
that something is wrong.  When a studio believes it has a winner, it 
rushes the product out to theaters as quickly as possible.  With 
NIGHTWATCH, Miramax has taken exactly the opposite approach, holding the 
movie in stasis for 18 months (it was originally supposed to be released 
in October 1996).  Anyone hoping for some quality entertainment will 
realize that this is not a good sign. 
     Most of the action, such as it is, takes place within a morgue, and 
Bornedal makes it a suitably creepy place, with long, silent corridors, 
flickering fluorescent lights, and dancing shadows.  Atmosphere is 
NIGHTWATCH's strongest asset.  When the new night watchman, Martin (Ewan 
McGregor), makes his first rounds through the eerily silent building, we 
sense his anxiety and the oppressive claustrophobia engendered by the 
place.  Sadly, it's all downhill from there as the movie devolves into 
something that is simultaneously familiar and ridiculous.
     Martin has taken this job because he believes the long hours of 
solitude will allow him time to study.  His girlfriend, Catherine (an 
underused Patricia Arquette), doesn't like his temporary career choice, 
although his best friend, James (Josh Brolin), is fascinated by it.  But 
James is a strange person with a penchant for playing bizarre and 
potentially-dangerous practical jokes, and his fascination with bodies 
and body parts may point to something dark within him.  Meanwhile, 
Martin is on duty the night that the latest victim of a serial killer is 
brought in.  The police detective in charge of the case, Cray (Nick 
Nolte, suffering a bad hair day), reveals to Martin that all of the 
victims have one thing in common:  their eyes have been gouged out.  
Soon, as part of one of James' practical jokes, Martin comes into 
contact with a prostitute named Joyce (Alix Koromzay) who not only was 
the friend of one of the killer's victims, but may be in danger herself.
     Aside from the atmosphere, which gradually dissipates as the plot 
takes off, NIGHTWATCH doesn't have much to offer.  The identity of the 
killer is revealed too early (although, to be fair, it's easy to guess 
who it is about 30 minutes before the camera finally pans to his face) 
and the convoluted means by which he sets Martin up to take the fall are 
laughably absurd.  Bornedal appears to be disregarding every aspect of 
police procedure and forensic technology by allowing something so 
blatantly outrageous to seem even vaguely possible.  Hitchcock's movies 
often had plot holes, but never were they this obvious to viewers while 
the film was in progress (most were unearthed during post-screening 
discussions).  Then there's the dialogue which, in trying to be 
profound, frequently ends up sounding silly.  We get lines like this 
one:  "If it can't be experienced, it's just meaningless chaos." 
     The acting is less-than-inspired.  Ewan McGregor (sporting a hit-
and-miss American accent), who has become a sought-after commodity 
following his outing in TRAINSPOTTING (so much so that George Lucas 
pegged him to play Obi-Wan Kenobi in the new STAR WARS film), has a few 
effective scenes, but, for the most part, he's bland.  Josh Brolin is 
over-the-top, but I suppose that's the intention.  And Nick Nolte gives 
what is likely his worst performance since ANOTHER 48 HOURS.  The only 
one who's any good is Brad Dourif as a doctor with the personality of a 
ghoul.
     My patience for dumb thrillers, where the audience is always about 
ten steps ahead of the characters, is wearing very thin.  If not for 
Bornedal's stylish approach to the material and a couple of effectively 
chilling sequences, NIGHTWATCH would have been a complete waste of time 
and effort.  As it is, it's still not worth more than an unenthusiastic 
video recommendation, which is the medium in which most interested 
viewers will end up seeing it, since its box office life is likely to be 
deservedly short.

With two hot young stars (Ewan McGregor and Patricia Arquette), a stylish
director, and a creepy premise based on a popular Danish thriller,
Nightwatch built some buzz... back in October 1996, when it was originally
slated to surface in theatres.  A year and a half and many scrapped release
dates later, Nightwatch is finally set to make its long-delayed screen bow,
and this flat, predictable chiller will likely come and go so quickly some
will wonder if it ever did come out.
The ever-amiable Scot McGregor struggles with an American accent as law
student Martin Bells, who bravely accepts the nightwatchman gig at a morgue
as a serial killer stalks the city.  After more bodies and plot twists pile
up, Martin finds himself the prime suspect in the case, earning the
suspicion of his girlfriend Katherine (Arquette, completely wasted in the
screaming galpal role), his best friend James (Josh Brolin), and police
inspector Cray (Nick Nolte) as the real killer continues his rampage.
Writer-director Ole Bornedal, adapting his 1995 original, is a natural at
creating atmosphere.  Martin's first few scenes in the morgue, with its
creaky elevator, long hallway, locked room with vats of body parts, and
stark white room with alarm cords hanging over the dead bodies (in case
they "wake up") are downright skincrawling.  Ironically, this grim,
daunting atmosphere of fear and dread disappears when the serial killer
plot comes to the forefront.  This is mainly because the so-called mystery
is so incredibly predictable.  One character is set so obviously set up as
a possibility early on that the person might as well have "red herring"
tattooed on the forehead, and when the killer's identity is revealed, it's
an anticlimax--there is no surprise.  And the overdone climax, with the
killer wielding a buzzsaw as two characters lie helplessly tied to
operating tables, inspired guffaws rather than shrieks from the audience.
According to the press notes, Bornedal's original Nightwatch "broke all
Danish box-office records."  I can only hope that that version is much
scarier than the American Nightwatch, or else Denmark's cinematic taste is
just about as notoriously bad as France's.  (opens April 17)

I recently read the book "I Fellini" where the great Italian director
was quoted as saying (and I'm paraphrasing) that once he finished a film
and it was in theaters that he always thought about stuff he should have
inserted before but never got a chance to, but how he'd never actually
go back to rework his films because once a film is finished the first
time, it's finished forever, and new projects should be tackled
instead.  Reason Two should be the Danish Georges Cluzot film, "The
Vanishing": after being highly acclaimed by critics worldwide as a
brilliant chiller of a film (I've never seen it), he was called by
Hollywood to remake it himself, and the result was not only a box office
dud, but a film that was virtually devoured by critics as a pretty
shitty little flick that totally ignored the power the original had.
Reason Three, then, should be "Nightwatch."  Also a Danish film,
"Nightwatch" has been recrafted by its director, Ole Bordenal, so that
it could be the most recent in the long line of Teen Horror Movies,
albeit a Teen Horror Movie starring young adults like hot Scot actor
Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette, and Josh Brolin (oh, and Nick Nolte
too).  If the previous reason should be any note to you, take into
consideration the fact that this film was original slated for release in
November of 1996, and lay in Movie Limbo until, oh, April of 1998, when
it was finally released to the titanic gross of about two million
dollars before shutting down and being shipped to video stores for
rental.  How I know this should be no surprise to anyone who knows me: I
was once a ginormous Ewan McGregor fan, as well as a "Scream" fan, and
the trailers for this film, at the time, were unbelievably cool.
Looking back at the same trailer, it still looks cool, because it's not
another subconcious "Scream" film, but rather an actual serious
thriller, with shots and scenes where you actually hold your breath in
fear, and are stuck in the middle of a mystery.  With lots of suspects.
And working the nightshift in a morgue of all places.  At least that's
what I gathered from the trailers.
Renting it not too long ago with a free coupon, after thinking "What the
hell?" to myself, I discovered the oft-fated truth that the actual movie
seldomly lives up to the trailer or the hype (or lack thereof, in this
case).  "Nightwatch" begins not half-bad, actually.  The credit sequence
is weird and complicated.  Lots of repeated shots of an interview on the
TV in connection with a murder and the investigating Inspector Cray
(Nolte), juxtaposed with scenes of a party between friends for Martin
Bells (McGregor), our humble protagonist, given by his girlfriend
(Arquette) and their two closest friends (Brolin and Lauren Graham).
It's all terribly corny, but it sets up a nice tone that should have
preceded, and it gets us thinking about who will be the notorious killer
amongst them.
We learn about Martin.  He's a law student, a bit dull, and has just
gotten a job working the night shift at the local morgue.  The retiring
nightshift watchman (Lonny Chapman) shows him the ropes of the job,
which includes turning a key box in every single room every hour to make
sure that he's doing his duties, and about whom to call in case of
emergencies, and to set up a little anecdote about an infamous murder
that happened years ago involving one of the nightwatchmen, a corpse,
and a bit of raving libido.  This is the best scene in the film, due
mostly in part to Chapman, whose worldweariness is immensely appealing
and totally fascinating.
Everything goes swell for Martin, then the local serial murdering pops
up again, and Martin becomes suspect number one in Cray's
investigating.  Soon the film is trying to make everyone a candidate for
suspectism, including Brolin's daredevil best friend (bringing about a
mindboggingly stupid subplot involving a prostitute played by Alix
Koromzay), the off-kilter Deputy Doc (Brad Douriff), even perhaps
Arquette.  Trouble is what it all comes down to is the viewer figuring
out who the killer is in the first ten minutes, then thinking it's
another character, and then coming back to their first intuition: an
annoying trend in mysteries these days, often used when the screenwriter
is suffering from laziness.  It doesn't really help that the style and
direction by Bordenal isn't exactly chilling.  There are several scenes
of Martin walking down long, brightly lit, yet eerie hallways to
discover what's on the other side, and these are geniuinely nail-biting,
but most of the time, there's no real tension, and most of the scary
shots/scenes were fragments in the trailer, a piece of film that did
work as being actually scary (at least in the hype-kind-of-way).
It also doesn't help that the characters are disturbingly boring and
one-dimensional, and the acting, for the most part, is piss-poor (you
heard me).  McGregor invests no personality whatsoever in Martin, and he
comes off as merely Ewan in auto-pilot and with an fake accent.  Brolin
is as annoying as he's ever been.  And Arquette is the worst: I'm not a
big fan of hers (I liked her a lot in "True Romance," though), and if
anyone ever wanted to challenge me on that notion, I can now cheerfully
point to her cliched and eyes-rolling performance in this film as proof
that, yes, she can really blow as an actress (Exhibit Two is her
embarrassingly overrated performance in "Lost Highway").  Only Nick
Nolte comes off as good.  Saddled with an otherwise thankless role, he
turns Inspector Cray into the one thing in this film that really works:
he's mysterious yet trusting, ominous yet approachable.  He's also a
marvel to watch, and if it ain't the best performance in a shitty movie
I've seen all year, then I've been forgetting something crucial here.
There are, as with most bad films, things I did like about this film.  I
liked the way that the killer is revealed: when it (I use "it" in lieu
of a gender, for obvious reasons) is revealed, it could be in the
location for other reasons.  A real nice touch.  I also liked the way
the film handled the key turning in the actual morgue part of the
morgue: it's chilling in a simplisitc, human way.  And for McGregor
fans, there's a nice little homage to "Shallow Grave."  But that's
really about it.  I personally like my horror films with creepiness, and
not exactly intelligence.  I can sometimes dismiss plot holes, lack of
characterization, and other such sins if there's great storytelling
there.  Case in point, Dario Argento's "Suspiria," which would have been
the world's stupidest film if it hadn't been so marvelously
constructed.  But when there's noting remotely creepy or engaging about
the way a film is construced, all I can then turn to is the story and
characters.  And when there's nothing there either, well then you'll
have to excuse me as a roll my eyes a bit.

NIGHTWATCH
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
------------------------------------------------------------------------Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) 
Dimension / 1:45 / 1998 / R (language, violence, corpse nudity, elements 
of necrophilia)
Cast: Ewan McGregor; Josh Brolin; Patricia Arquette; Nick Nolte; Lauren 
Graham; Alix Koromzay; Brad Dourif; John C. Reilly 
Director: Ole Bornedal 
Screenplay: Ole Bornedal; Steven Soderbergh
------------------------------------------------------------------------After sitting on a shelf for well over a year, Ole Bornedal's 
"Nightwatch" is finally being released with little fanfare. Word had it 
that Dimension Films, the movie's distributor, smelled a big dud and 
waited until the competition was weak to see it open. But because 
"Nightwatch" is actually a decent thriller, it's probably closer to the 
truth to say that the studio was eager to see their film ride the 
coattails of star Ewan McGregor -- soon to be seen as a young Ben Kenobi 
in George Lucas' "Star Wars" prequels -- to a moderate, brisk payoff. 
Either way, modern horror is in thanks to the "Scream" films, and 
"Nightwatch" creates a suitably scary atmosphere that renders it 
watchable even when the plot degenerates into a blood-soaked mess. An 
eyeball here, a severed thumb there -- when everything turns gory, who 
needs a coherent story? 
In this reworking of Bornedal's Dutch "Nattevagten," McGregor plays 
Martin Bells, a young law student strapped for cash and study time. A 
job as the night watchman of the local morgue appears to give him the 
solution to both of his problems -- until, that is, strange things begin 
to happen. A serial killer is leaving his mark on the city, and his 
victims' bodies appear to have a life of their own. Making matters worse 
is a series of clues that leads the investigator (Nick Nolte) in charge 
of the case to suspect that Martin is the mastermind behind the murders. 
While Martin slowly realizes he's obviously the victim of a set-up, 
distrust falls on all those around him. Is the real killer his tough-guy 
best friend (Josh Brolin)? Is it the seemingly sinister mortician (Brad 
Dourif) who keeps late hours? Does his dedicated girlfriend (Patricia 
Arquette) know more than she lets on? Maybe, maybe not. 
It's very easy to peg the identity of "Nightwatch"'s resident psycho, so 
much that another character becomes a red herring to the obvious 
extreme. (For the record, I had everything correctly figured out a 
half-hour in, and I'm usually not that ahead of the ball.) This would 
have been acceptable had the movie not run out of surprises at its 
midpoint, but "Nightwatch" reveals too much too soon and grinds to a 
halt thereafter. When the murderer explicitly makes himself known by 
stepping out from behind a bathroom door, you think, "Yeah, and ... ?", 
and anticipate a few more twists that are maddeningly never delivered. 
When all is finally out in the open about the him and his past, ask 
yourself how he got where he is now, or how he plans to get away with 
what he does in the movie's climax. "Nightwatch"'s convoluted tale 
sports a whole lotta holes -- it's definitely not for theatrical 
nitpickers. 
On the other hand, "Nightwatch" does offer some resilience. As far as 
sheer, creepy ambience is concerned, the movie's got the most effective 
feel since "Seven." The morgue is where most of "Nightwatch" unfolds, 
and the film actually works the best when it lets McGregor roam its 
eerily fluorescent-lit halls in nervous silence; some of these sequences 
are so genuinely frightening that you wish they were put to use in a 
better movie. The same goes for the camaraderie between the well-played 
McGregor and Brolin characters -- they're constantly trying to one-up 
each other with dares, practical jokes and other games. It's an 
interesting friendship, one, of course, that will serve the serial 
killer storyline before everything is over. The cast does fine work, 
even when some players (particularly Arquette) are underused. These 
strengths outweigh the flaws, but just barely. While "Nightwatch" may 
end with a whimper, at least it starts out with a bang.
