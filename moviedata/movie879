THE LEGEND OF RITA (Die Stille Nach dem Schuss)
Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) is an idealist in 1970's West Germany.  She's
also a terrorist, partially because of her love for Andreas Klein (Harald 
Schrott), the movement's leader.  Rita is caught during transit from
Beirut via East Berlin with a pistol and comes to an understanding with
Stasi officer Erwin Hull (Martin Wuttke) who will become the dominant force
in her life.
When a guard is shot during a prison break for Andreas, the group goes 
underground in Paris.  Rather than blow her cover over a traffic violation, 
Rita shoots a policeman, then turns to Hull for help in director Volker 
Schlondorff's "The Legend of Rita."
Screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhaase researched West German terrorist groups,
in particular the Baader-Meinhof gang, to capture the characteritics of this 
part of an era for his fictional story, while director Schlondorff 
emphasized exploring pre-unification East Germany. 
'Legend' is a Stasi (East German secret police) term for a false identify,
something Hull offers all of Rita's colleagues if they remain in East
Germany.  When her colleagues decide to flee to Beirut, Rita, disillusioned
with Andreas' personal disloyalty, stays behind and becomes Suzanne Schmidt.
She attempts to fold into life as a fabric printer in a
factory, but her passionate, idealistic nature makes her coworkers take
notice.  She takes interest in the rebellious, alcoholic Tatiana 
(Nadja Uhl, cowinner of the Best Actress award at the Berlin Film Festival 
with Biglau) whom the other women shun and raises eyebrows when she 
donates ten Deutschmarks to a charity her coworkers recognize as fraud.
Suzanne and Tatiana's story is reminiscent of the French film "The Dreamlife
of Angels," but the friendship is cut short when Andreas' death, publicized
on international news, reminds viewers of the wanted Rita Vogt.  Hull creates
Rita's next legend as Sabine Walter, a child care worker at a summer camp.
Jochen Pettka (Alexander Beyer) takes interest and wishes her to marry him
and return to Russia - time for Hull to step in again and give Rita a new
life.
The Hull/Vogt relationship resembles that of Tcheky Karyo and Anne Parrilaud
in "La Femme Nikita," wary and somewhat disapproving at first, respectful and
romantically inclined after time.  Martin Wuttke, who resembles Denis Lavant
of "Beau Travail," gives a subtly shaded performance that keeps his presence
felt throughout the film.  He's as caught up in the turmoil of the times as
Rita, particularly when East Germany's duplicity in their dealings with West
German terrorists comes to light when the wall falls.  Biblau, in her feature
film debut, gives a star making performance as Rita.  Her idealism cuts
through
her bourgeois background giving her strength and confidence.  Biblau mows 
down authority figures in her path with sheer determination and approaches 
each new legend with clear-eyed curiousity.  She almost makes us forget that
her fearless character is still a cop killer and terrorist.
Support is solid with Uhl standing out as the bleery young Tatiana, so
determined to leave the East she'll go via vodka if no other transport is 
available.  Also notable is Jenny Shily as Fredericke, another young idealist
who turns away from a moneyed life of horse riding championships to commit
crimes for Andreas.  She's not as capable as Rita, offering a nice contrast.
Director Schlondorff takes a (mostly) debut cast and gets realistic, powerful
performances.  His work with screenwriter Kohlhaase makes "The Legend of Rita"
work on many levels - as a character study, a political and historical
document
and a contrast of East and West.  Cinematographer Andreas Hofer provides a
documentary look which works well for the story.

"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
You've got to admire a film that uses the Rolling Stones' "Street
Fighting Man" for its opening credits, and then shows a bank robbery
where the thieves bring baked goods for their victims and boldly
announce their arrival by shouting, "Hello, guys - we're the robbers."
Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there for The Legends of Rita.
The film, which has been nominated for a handful of awards in Europe, is
a fairly interesting look at the political climate of Germany in the
1970s and '80s.  Rita boasts a strong lead performance by an actress
with very little film experience, but, like Bagger Vance's legend, the
picture is kind of dull and pointless.
Bibiana Beglau stars as Rita Vogt, a member of West Germany's Red Army
Faction - the group responsible for the bank robbery in the film's
opening scene.  The RAF's mission is to destabilize capitalism in the
country through any means necessary.  Stealing money from the bank isn't
robbery - it's redistribution of wealth, and Rita gleefully gives a
panhandler a fistful of the loot lifted from the raid.
But Rita is only in the RAF because she has a crush on Andi (Harald
Schrott), one of the group's militant leaders.  Sure, she believes
somewhat in the RAF's mission and, since most of their actions are
non-violent, Rita finds the whole idea of rebellion pretty damn
exciting.  But after a couple of mishaps, she finds herself hiding in
East Germany with a wig and a new - and quite less exciting - identity.
The "Legends" in the title refer to each new identity Rita is forced to
assume (with help from the East German secret police).  In one, she
falls in love with a lifeguard.  In another, she befriends a woman named
Tatjana (Nadja Uhl), who craves a life away from her drab city and
boring factory job and can't understand why Rita is so content.  We're
not talking about exciting stuff here.  Once Rita and her RAF cronies
disband, the film gets awfully boring.  For a while, it seemed like it
could be gearing up for some hot girl-on-girl action, but it never pans
out.
Beglau's performance is good enough to rise above the mess of a story
(think Katarina Witt, but with a gun instead of ice skates).  Director
Volker Schlöndorff (Palmetto) does a decent job recreating the gritty
look of pre-Wall-fall Germany, but his script (which was co-written by
Wolfgang Kohlhaase) really needs to be kicked up a notch or two.  Rita
starts promisingly, like Cecil B. Demented, but ends with all of the
gusto and pizzazz in a round of laundry.

"Legend" - in Stasi-speak (East German Secret Police lingo), a term used to 
connote a false identity. 
In the 70's, militant idealism swept through the youth movement in West 
Germany. For Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau), it is the most exciting time of 
her life. She believes in a just world, built on violence if necessary, and 
is in love with charismatic leader, Andi (Harald Schott), of their little 
group of revolutionaries. The gang robs a bank as their first strike 
against capitalism and the die is cast for the rest of their lives. 
When Rita passes through East Berlin in transit from Beirut, a hidden 
pistol is found in her bag and she comes under the scrutiny of East German 
security in the person of Stasi officer Edwin Hull (Martin Wuttke). The 
secret policeman lets her pass through to the west, where Rita gets 
involved in a botched jailbreak for Andi. A guard is killed and the gang 
must go underground to avoid arrest. The movement remains stagnant for 
years and everyone grows complacent in their Parisian exile until, one day, 
Rita is stopped for a routine traffic violation. She tries to run for it 
and becomes a cop killer in the process. Her only out is asylum in East 
Germany and her first legend - factory worker Susanne Schmidt - is born. 
Rita/Susanne must now live the life she has idolized for all these years 
and is content with her new world where there is no wealth, but no poverty, 
either. These feelings aren't shared by her friend, Tatjana (Nadja Uhl), 
who just wants out of the East, even if it is with the help of a stolen 
bottle of vodka. Their deepening relationship is abruptly ended when the 
news reports Andi's death in a skirmish with the police. Rita's old wanted 
poster is broadcast on TV and she must seek a new legend. 
Hull arranges a new identity for Rita as Sabine Walter, a child-care 
worker, and she enters the happiest time of her life. She meets a young 
physicist, Jochen (Alexander Beyer), and, for the first time, falls in love 
with something other than the cause. Rita's dreams, that summer, of living 
happily ever after in the worker's paradise will soon be dashed when, in 
1989, the Berlin Wall came down and Rita loses her protectorate. 
Volker Schlondorff brings us a fictional look into a period of our history 
that is relatively virgin territory. Only the recent "Invisible Circus" 
comes to mind and that runs a pale second to "The Legend of Rita." The 
helmer, with screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhasse, examines the life of one 
young German radical, Rita, and her flight from the law as she seeks asylum 
in East Germany. He succeeds in developing a character study of a woman 
whose rash youthful decisions marks her for life. Newcomer Beglau gives a 
commanding performance as Rita and matures nicely as she struggles to 
maintain her idealism after her fateful decision to pull the trigger on the 
gun and murder a policeman, a rash act that changed her life forever. 
Although the focus of the entire film is on Rita, the supporting cast does 
a good job in fleshing out those around her. Martin Wuttke is outstanding 
as Stasi copper, Hull, and conveys the controlling nature of the 
totalitarian Communist government whose policy is "we're for the people, 
that's why we're against them." Nadja Uhl is believable as the desperate 
Tatjana who doesn't see her "paradise" through same idealistic glasses as 
Rita. 
Schlondorff, with a veteran team behind the camera, gives the film a sound 
period feel of the 70's and 80's. The flick has a docu quality in its 
realism, provided by cinematographer Andreas Hofer. Costumer Anne-Gret 
Oehme and make-up artists Jeanette-Nicole Latzelsberger and Karin Stephan 
do a seamless job of clothing and aging the characters over a decade plus 
time, oftentimes as disguises to hide the fugitives' identities. Cheesy 
East German rock music works wonderfully in putting you where the filmmaker 
wants you to be. Rita's struggles with right versus wrong, good versus 
evil, makes for an interesting study of a world little known.
