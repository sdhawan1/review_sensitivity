On our way to the screening, we stopped to help a motorist in distress, 
so I ended up being tardy to this film. Therefore you may wish to 
pro-rate its accuracy. 
Charlize Theron finds herself a monthly project, rich work-aholic Keanu 
is November. 
Keanu frustrated and un-amused by the carefree, spontaneous, potentially 
dangerous Theron reads, "What do you want with me?" 
Keanu, "What makes you think I need helping?" 
Charlize, "You're in a box. I'll lift the lid." 
Keanu sarcastically replies, "Just hearing that makes me feel healed." 
I like this script - sort of a "Harold and Maude"-lite. Very well paced, 
and carefully directed except for an abrupt, sorely reworked ending 
scene. Still, soft and bright like the cinematography, the film packs a 
lot of heart. 
Charlize is stunning, lovable and professional; Jason Isaacs, awesome; 
little Liam superb; and Keanu, simply terrible. I've heretofore defended 
Keanu from the robust pool of criticism regarding his acting abilities. 
But, his performance in this film is clearly underwhelming. He delivers 
lines as if he'd just awaken from deep slumber and was handed the script 
even before a cup of coffee. Happily (and somewhat amazingly), despite 
the blunt deficiency of acting prowess in this effort, Keanu's resilient 
charm and good looks still command while on screen. 
Done well, a crisp free and easy scene in which Charlize romps on the 
beach with a clan of beautifully groomed white show dogs. It's a 
wonderful way to impress upon us the theme, "If you want to enjoy life 
... you've got to risk getting a little sand in your fur." Also of note, 
a short scene in which Keanu returns to his childhood home is accented 
nicely by Tony Bennett's "The other half of me" as a remembrance of 
Keanu's history with his dad. In fact, this is just one of other 
well-selected musical pieces on the soundtrack. Thirdly and fourthly, 
two advertising meetings - one where Keanu introduces the "Hot" dog ad 
campaign with fervor and passion, and the other where Keanu meets with 
the god of advertising. Keanu peaks in both of these masterfully crafted 
scenes. 
Warm and cozy dialogue, direction, and apt cast, compensate for Keanu's 
acting shortcomings all the way up to, but not including, the ending 
bridge scene. The timing and pacing of which beats completely off-sync 
with the rest of the picture. Even the direction and editing lag here. 
Nice bridge though. 
Would have been an "A-" were Keanu to have acted, but since he didn't, 
would have been a "B+" had the ending sequence been more aptly scripted 
and shot. Still I enjoyed what I enjoyed and will remember the sparkling 
zest for life and the strong heart of this picture.

Imagine LOVE STORY meets ABC's DHARMA & GREG, and you'll know all you
need to know about SWEET NOVEMBER.  Literally.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is a high-strung, highly successful
advertising executive with no time for a life outside of his job, much
to the dismay of his constantly ignored girlfriend Angelica (Lauren
Graham).  But Nelson's life quickly changes when, after he causes Sara
Deever (Charlize Theron) to flunk her DMV exam, she storms into his life
in a big way.  Like a whirlwind gone mad, Sara goes on a mission to
"save" the stodgy Nelson from himself, by proposing that, for the whole
month of November, he stays with her and in exchange, she'll "help him".
How, and why, is for Nelson to discover in what Sara promises to be a
magical thirty days.
The Upshot (2nd WARNING: **EVEN MORE spoilers contained below**):
KeanuNuts, y'all might as well get your brickbats out now, 'cuz I tell
ya, he stunk up the joint.  Whoever decided to call it "Sweet" wasn't
quite descriptive enough.  "Sickly sweet"...now that's more like it.
I don't know what was worse: the *absolutely, positively mindboggling*
[in case the KeanuDroids didn't hear me the first time] miscasting of
Keanu "whoa" Reeves, or the complete repulsion I felt in noting Greg
Germann's irritating presence in not one, but *two* lame remake flicks
this weekend ("November" and the equally dreadful DOWN TO EARTH).  That,
and the syrupy sweetness of the general storyline.  Holy Chris on a pogo
stick, I think I developed a severe case of sugar diabetes just watching
this thing.
Two things saved "November" from my
"this-must-die-an-excruciatingly-horrible-death" redlight rating: the
first is my inexplicable liking for things Charlize Theron; must be her
eyes (what can I say; they mesmerize me) and the button cuteness her
character showed up to the **BEGIN BIG SPOILER** first Obligatory
Illness Scene - each moment after which, was sheer torture for me to
witness, in anticipation of LOVE STORY, BRIAN'S SONG, and STUPORNOVA,
all rolled up into one smarmy little ball. **END BIG SPOILER**
The other little slice of heaven hiding in "November's" Deep Dish Of
Hell, was Frank Langella as Edgar Price (who, keeping with the DHARMA &
GREG/ABC theme, is "November's" version of Miles Drentell from ONCE &
AGAIN and thirtysomething - if Miles Drentell had an Evil Twin Brother).
For the few moments he was on screen, Langella portrayed a totally
heartless businessman with an originality worthy of adoration; had his
role been expanded, "November" would've been a *much* different movie
experience for me.  My jury's out whether that would've wound up A Good
Thing, though; I have the feeling that more Edgar Price would've
amounted to that much more artificial sweetener being poured on to
counterbalance his Pure Evol.  And _that_ would most def be A Bad Thing.
Sorry, that's it as far as worthwhile characters/storylines go.  I've
seen the "Hip Gay/TV Friend" done better before, so Jason Isaacs' turn
as Transvestite Chas, didn't really Take Me There; and Liam Aiken as
Abner, the boy searching for a Father Figure, was kinda creepy.  That
leaves us with the aforementioned irritant Greg Germann as Nelson's
sycophant business partner Vince, and my friend and yours, the K Man
himself.  So as not to taunt the KeanuWorshippers overmuch, I won't go
into vast detail of the many times I wanted to rip his lungs out and
serve them to Hannibal Lecter, just so his GOTdam agent wouldn't dare
stain the silver screen again by allowing him to be so terribly miscast
in a role that, if it were any more past his reach as an actor, he'd
have to hire someone with an extension cord and a ten foot pole, just to
come within a football field's length of touching.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
Not that he needs my approval or anything - I'm fairly sure Mr. Reeves
isn't sitting at home pissing in his beer because some third-rate hack
in Podunkville Called Him Names - but I actually do like Keanu *in roles
in which he plays to the level of his abilities*.  I very much dug him
in THE MATRIX, for example; and he was one of the better things about
the disappointing (and still unreviewed by me) THE GIFT.  But I say now,
and will repeat again: whatever the casting person who thought Reeves
was right for this role, was smoking when they cast him, I don't want
any parts of.
SWEET NOVEMBER (rating: yellowlight):
"Dancing In September"..."Sweet November"...dag, is it Spring yet?!?

If forced to name a celebrity I'm completely tired of seeing and hearing
about, the names Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron would be blurted out just
after Jennifer Lopez and right before Kate Hudson.  Not only do Keanu and
Charlize have ridiculous names, they've also appeared in three films apiece
in the last six months, most of which were formulaic crap (him: The
Replacements, The Watcher and The Gift; her: The Yards, Men of Honor and The
Legend of Bagger Vance).  Hey, why not put them in a film together?  It's
almost as if Hollywood senses I'm on the brink of a workplace shooting and
is trying to nudge me off the fence.
Sweet November is a remake of moderately entertaining 1968 film that starred
Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley (think of a young Charles Grodin, only with
charisma and hair).  Both films are about a dying woman who takes on one
dysfunctional man each month of her last year on Earth in some bizarre
attempt to...to...okay, I have no idea why she does it.  The 2001 version,
lifelessly directed by Pat O'Connor (Dancing at Lughnasa), swaps the woman's
cool Greenwich Village loft for a cramped San Francisco walkup and totally
blows the ending, turning the subtle, well-done original into something
extraordinarily unpleasant and plodding.
Theron plays Sara Deever, a less-annoying version of Jenna Elfman's Dharma.
Sara is Hollywood eccentric, which means she has close-cropped hair, clothes
that don't match and wears a lot of weird hats and scarves.  Her "November"
is Nelson Moss (Reeves), an advertising executive portrayed as a
high-powered, workaholic version of Darrin Stephens.  Nelson's life is ruled
by his work and everything else, including his lovely but perpetually
ignored girlfriend (Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham), is pushed aside.  It's
hard to tell if the character is a dick or if the actor is a moron (it's
probably a little of both).
The two "meet cute" at the DMV, where Sara offers to make Nelson her
"November."  Confused (a stretch for Reeves, I'm sure), Nelson writes her
off as a kook, but takes her up on the offer after getting fired and dumped
on the same day.  He's still wary of Sara's motives - heck, I'd be expecting
her to turn into Kathy Bates in Misery, or find out Satan is somehow
involved (Reeves and Theron were in The Devil's Advocate together) - but
eventually they fall in love, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie.
When Nelson pesters Sara about her strange monthly arrangements, she
replies, "I told you - I can't tell you my reasons."  He has no clue
(another stretch for Reeves), so, apparently, he hasn't seen November's
trailer, where Sara's raccoon-like, sunken cancer eyes are prominently
displayed, ruining the ending for anyone who couldn't see it coming a mile
away.  Sure enough, about an hour into the film, she starts acting
mysterious, sweaty and tired, and you can only sit back and wait for the
inevitable, which drags out with the exciting pace of a nursing home Bingo
game.
The ending is so bad, somebody at my screening actually shouted, "Hurry up
and die already!"  Okay, it was me, but you get the point.  There's plenty
of other stuff to get pissed off about, like the fact that it's a Warner
Bros. film that shamelessly plugs several of its products (America Online,
CNN and Sports Illustrated, among others).  Look for the scene where Nelson
and his buddy (Greg Germann, Down to Earth) talk to each other on their cell
phones, even though they're walking right next to each other (just like
Clueless).  If that wasn't bad enough, there's also a karaoke scene where
Keanu shows he's a better singer than an actor.  But that's kind of like
saying George W. Bush is a lot smarter than people give him credit for.

        If you cast Keanu Reeves in a film with the expectation of him
actually being good, you'd better have a have a role that fits
comfortably within his limited range.  Take, for instance, the films in
which the notorious laughing stock has actually been passable or better:
the _Bill_and_Ted_ films, which made ideal use of his natural blankness
for laughs; _Speed_ and _The_Matrix_, which used his inexpressiveness as
a veneer of toughness; and the recent _The_Gift_ well, credit must go to
Sam Raimi for pushing the non-acting actor into effectively playing a
villainous part no one would think he could ever pull off.  
        Then there's the strange matter of the 1995 romance
_A_Walk_in_the_Clouds_.  Technically speaking, Reeves is his usually
horrible self; witness the embarrassing `Don't you realize how alive she
is?  How _special_ she is?' monologue to see just how wrong he is for the
part of a soulful ex-G.I.  Yet somehow those disastrous displays were
forgivable in the end, and that's because he had such superb chemistry
with leading lady Aitana Sanchez-Gijon.  From their first gaze, those two
smoldered, and when it comes to swoony love stories, that's what counts. 
_Sweet_November_, a remake of the 1968 weepie of the same name, is a
like-minded film that once again finds Reeves in a part clearly not
suited for him: Nelson Moss, a selfish, flamboyant, workaholic
advertising executive.  The difference here is that there is no romantic
rapport to redeem his woeful work or the film itself.
        The lack of spark should come as no surprise, for Reeves'
_November_ co-star is Charlize Theron, with whom he previously
teamed---and displayed little chemistry--in the supernatural thriller
_The_Devil's_Advocate_.  She plays Sara Deever, the type of kooky free
spirit who always comes into the life of the uptight protagonist not only
at just the right time, but in an oh-so-contrived Meet Cute: they
initially encounter each other as they take a DMV written exam.  Somehow
sensing the stress in his life, Sara makes him an unusual offer: to be
the latest in string of one-month-only lovers.  For a mere 30 days, she
will attempt to make his life easier and give him all the benefits of
having a female companion (read: limitless sex), and in return all he has
to do is devote just about every waking moment of said time period with
her.  Once the time expires, so does their relationship, with no
questions asked, no hard feelings.
        So why exactly does Sara do this?  The trailers and television
spots have made the reason abundantly clear, and there's no reason for me
to spoil the late-in-film revelation for those few still interested in
seeing this film.  But even with her motivation in mind, the premise
seems overly mechanical, not to mention dated.  The modern-day
accoutrements (cell phones, a transvestite neighbor/best friend for Sara)
brought in by director Pat O'Connor and screenwriters Kurt Voelker and
Paul Yurick to update the story actually hurt the film even more.  In
this contemporary context, nothing about Sara (aside from
promiscuity-according-to-schedule) seems terribly eccentric.  She's a
single twentysomething.  She's a pet groomer.  She has a lot of plants. 
She has a fondness for scarves.  How any of these rather run-of-the-mill
qualities can make some ice cold slickster somehow change his whole way
of thinking is hard to swallow.
        Of course, there is the fact that Sara comes in the gorgeous form
of Theron, but this usually capable actress manages to make Sara's
perceived quirkiness less than charming.  Theron tries too hard to be
flighty and daffy, and as such Sara appears to be putting on some forced
act, not to mention a bit too pushy.  Reeves' `efforts' fail to make the
strained attraction any more natural--not that anything about his work in
this film can remotely fall into that description.  His stiff yet
overdone swagger as Norman `A' is ridiculous; try not to laugh when he
lets loose what is supposed to be an evil, mischievous cackle toward his
boss.  With the abrupt change to sensitive Norman `B' comes the flip
side: instead of overdoing it, Reeves reverts to his usual screen
catatonia.
        When it comes to these movie romances, however, chemistry between
leads holds a lot of redemptive value.  Unfortunately, Reeves and Theron
are as tepid together here as they were in their last collaboration. 
They fail to convince that what we are told are growing feelings between
Nelson and Sara are indeed signs of true love, let alone some sweeping,
larger-than-life, world-changing passion.  Considering the film's fairly
effective and unusually (for this genre) understated close, `Sweet
November' could very well have been one primo slice of melodramatic
manipulation with the right pair of actors.  Then again, I imagine that
already happened--back in 1968.

THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE's Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are together again
in Pat O'Connor's SWEET NOVEMBER.  The movie is part light, romantic comedy 
and part major weeper, but the leads are as miscast this time as they 
were well cast the last.  An aptly named picture, SWEET NOVEMBER is 
cloyingly sweet and feels like it has a running time of an entire month.
This remake of a 1968 film of the same name, starring Sandy Dennis and 
Anthony Newley, produces laughs at the wrong moments.  The comedic first 
half, which plays like a rejected pilot for a television sitcom, 
produces few chuckles.  The serious second half, on the other hand, is 
so schmaltzy that it will have you laughing in ridicule at its most 
"tender" moments, especially when the big "surprise" is revealed.
The story concerns a take-no-prisoners, work-24-hours-a-day, ad 
executive named Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves).  He's the best of the best, 
and he knows it.  But when he explodes in a pompous pique in front of a 
major client, he's fired.
Not to worry.  A crazy woman, Sara Deever (Charlize Theron), comes 
crashing into his life, stalking him like Glenn Close in FATAL 
ATTRACTION.  "Nelson, would you like to be my November?" she asks him.  
She runs a one-month-only, in-her-home program to help lost men get in 
touch with their inner child.  (As a side benefit, they get free sex 
with Charlize Theron, but the movie works hard to make this seem 
downright unimportant.  Right.) 
"Truth is," Nelson informs Sara, "I don't have a month.  Time is money."  
He, of course, changes his mind and is soon frolicking in San Francisco 
Bay with Sara and a fatherless, neighborhood kid, Abner (Liam Aiken), 
who looks and acts like an amalgamation of every overly "cute" kid that 
has ever appeared in the movies.
In the absence of any genuine chemistry between them, Reeves and Theron 
are given silly things to say ("Life isn't perfect") and do (singing, 
don't ask).  Everything in the movie's first half is ha-ha funny.  His 
apartment has a dozen television sets stacked on each other like an 
electronics store.  Hers has only one TV, but it's being used as a 
planter.  And everything in the second part of the story is three hankie 
heartbreaking.  Well, it's supposed to be tragically sad, but it isn't 
because there isn't a moment of genuine emotion in it.  The people 
around me were laughing when they were supposed to be crying, and who 
could blame them.  SWEET NOVEMBER doesn't deserve any respect.
SWEET NOVEMBER runs a long 1:54.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content 
and language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.

A cold workaholic. A free spirit who gradually helps him to loosen up and 
care about others. An unforeseen passion between the two unlikely souls. A 
tragic secret that threatens to tear them apart. Had "Sweet November," 
directed by Pat O'Connor (1998's "Dancing at Lughnasa"), been handled with 
less care, it would have surely seemed like little else than a weepy NBC 
"movie-of-the-week." Its offbeat, somewhat far-fetched premise gradually 
makes way for the type of conventional romantic drama that could only end 
with a tearjerker ending. In raising the material slightly above the norm for 
this indisputable, somewhat shameless genre, screenwriter Kurt Voelker has 
offered a subtle hand in making everything come together without as much sap 
as there could have been. Ultimately, the movie is far from perfect, and the 
running time is about fifteen minutes past its prime, but it genuinely 
surprises by saving itself with the gently done, powerful conclusion.
Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is a hard-working, emotionless San Francisco ad 
executive who is so dedicated to his work, he has lost track of the other 
things in life that make it worth living. He lives so much by the clock, in 
fact, that when his alarm goes off while he is in the middle of having sex 
with his neglected girlfriend, Anjelica (Lauren Graham), he immediately stops 
to get ready for work.
While renewing his license at the local DMV, Nelson has a chance meeting with 
Sara Deever (Charlize Theron), who is thrown out of the testing center for 
responding to a question that Nelson whispers to her. Without a license, she 
persuades Nelson to act as her chauffeur one night, only to break into an 
animal shelter and save two puppies from being put to death. A joyous, 
beautiful, young woman who has learned to not take life for granted for even 
a second, Sara presents Nelson with a proposition: for the entire month of 
November, she will invite him to move in with her, and spend every minute 
with him. Nelson thinks she's crazy.
After a failed meeting the next day and a nasty confrontation with his boss, 
Nelson finds himself fired from his job. To make matters worse, Anjelica 
leaves him. With nothing to lose, Nelson finally accepts Sara's offer. Her 
goal, of course, is to make him wake up and smell the coffee--that is, become 
a better, more well-rounded and humane, person. As Nelson gradually falls for 
her, Sara is frightened to find herself attracted to him in a way she never 
has before. The answer to why Sara casually chooses a man every month to mold 
and enlighten is one that Nelson is unsure of, although it is sure to be 
uncovered by the time November comes to a close.
A remake of the same-titled 1968 film starring Sandy Dennis and Anthony 
Newley, "Sweet November" meanders for much of its length, yet never so much 
that it doesn't have time to recover for an excellent final half-hour. The 
success of the climax comes as something of a shock, considering that it is 
this potentially asinine section that seemed most likely to fail. What comes 
before isn't so much bad as it is merely shopworn. The machinations of the 
generic plot work overtime to offer little in the way of original material, 
and many sequences feel repetitive, as if they are just repeating what has 
already been established in the budding romance between Nelson and Sara.
Increasing the classiness of "Sweet November" and making its developments 
credible is the exquisite Charlize Theron (2000's "The Legend of Bagger 
Vance"). In a role that somehow feels made precisely for her, as a showcase 
for both her beauty and talent, Theron creates a character that is as lovable 
and alluring as she is unconventional in her way of life. Having Nelson fall 
hopelessly in love with Sara seems like a nonexistent stretch with someone 
like Theron playing her, and we grow to care about her in a way that is not 
immediately palpable.
In his second film with Theron (after 1997's superior, scary "The Devil's 
Advocate"), Keanu Reeves makes for a believably close-vested, frigid 
businessman in the first half, and a progressively softer human being who 
realizes the artificiality of his day-to-day existence in the latter. 
Criticized in the past for his less-than-naturalistic performances, there is 
no doubt that Reeves has matured as an actor in recent years, plausibly 
playing a serial killer (2000's "The Watcher"), an abusive, backwoods husband 
(2000's "The Gift"), an unsuspecting computer programmer/action hero (1999's 
"The Matrix"), and a football player (2000's "The Replacements").
The supporting cast is almost uniformly good, if not necessarily 
well-developed. Jason Isaacs (the villainous Col. Tavington in 2000's "The 
Patriot") is a standout as Chaz, the best friend/neighbor of Sara's, offering 
up a strong amount of wisdom and sweetness, while Michael Rosenbaum (1998's 
"Urban Legend") shows much promise in the small role of his caring boyfriend. 
Greg Germann (TV's "Ally McBeal") serviceably plays Reeves' snooty 
coworker-partner, but remains one-dimensional throughout. And Liam Aiken 
(1998's "Stepmom") poses as only a cursory annoyance as a fatherless child 
who takes a liking to Nelson.
The dreamy cinematography by Edward Lachman successfully present the 
surroundings with the appropriate amount of beauty Sara so passionately sees 
in the world, while the music score, by Christopher Young, thankfully does 
not overpower the actors' emotions or spell out what we are supposed to feel 
in any given scene. Meanwhile, the recurring song in the picture, "Only You," 
by Enya, is perfect in setting up its "Love Story" angle, as well as the 
character of Sara.
For the middle forty-five minutes, the energy in "Sweet November" admittedly 
begins to flag. With Sara and Nelson now in love, the story slows to a crawl 
and starts to repeat itself, all the while setting up the tragic plot twist 
that everything predictably leads up to. While this turn doesn't fully 
succeed and isn't exactly necessarily, credit director Pat O'Connor for 
playing it out with a generally light touch and (spoiler alert ahead) sparing 
us a deathbed scene. "Sweet November" is flawed, to be sure, but its heart 
sure is in the right place.
