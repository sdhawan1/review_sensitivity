A film review by Aileo Weinmann - Copyright Å  2000 filmcritic.com
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (a film which should otherwise need no
introduction whatsoever) reminds me of that strange Christmas feeling
that hits about five minutes after all of the presents have been
opened.  It's that indescribable longing for more, even if nothing's
really missing.  There's so much expectation, so much buildup, that
somehow even though you're satisfied, it's not quite enough.
Jim Carrey is fabulous as the titular Grinch, that much is sure.  His
trademark physical antics fit "the mean one" perfectly, without stealing
the heart from one of Dr. Seuss' most notorious characters.  He proves
that he's up to the tall order of balancing two larger-than-life
personalities: himself and the Grinch.  The delicate mix that Carrey
strikes -- giving just enough of himself to the role without
obliterating the creature in the process -- is really the beauty of his
performance.
Overall, the film stays true to the message of Dr. Seuss' original 1957
story and the 1966 animated version, although there's a good deal of
stretching required to make it feature-length.  In this version, from
high atop Mt. Crumpit, the original killjoy is positively disgusted with
all the Whos in Whoville and their happy buzzing in preparation for
Christmas.  So he decides to go incognito to town, in an attempt to
muddle things up a bit, where he runs into Cindy Lou Who (Taylor
Momsen), who's struggling with her own doubts over the true meaning of
Christmas.  Intrigued by this chance encounter, Cindy Lou embarks on a
mission to discover The Grinch's past, interviewing all the Whos who've
known him and filling in a childhood that Dr. Seuss left up to our
imaginations.
At this point, the film rejoins the familiar tale, albeit dressed
spectacularly in computer animation and with the minimum number of
mature references to keep parents entertained.  With wonderful costumes
and sets made of pure fantasy, The Grinch should leave most viewers
feeling warm and fuzzy.  The only thing you shouldn't expect is to be
surprised, which I must admit I was kind of hoping for.

      It's like Christmas coming early with this heart-warming
gift of a live-action comedy fantasy. Ron Howard's enchanting screen
adaptation of Dr. Seuss' story not only tells the tale of the Whos in
Whoville but the imaginative screenplay by Jeffrey Price & Peter
S. Seaman, narrated by Anthony Hopkins, delves deeply into the
backstory of the grouchy, gruff Grinch (Jim Carrey), revealing what
made him so bitterly malevolent, living alone in a cavernous cave on
the top of Mr. Crumpit with only his dog Max as company. The plot
revolves around little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), whose parents
(Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon) are immersed in the crass commercialism of
Christmas, particularly besting a neighbor (Christine Baranski) in the
Whobilation lighting competition. Curious about The Grinch and his
contemptible behavior, Cindy Lou investigates what seared his soul,
made him an outcast, and inspired his vengeance. Buried under layers
of rubbery make-up and green fur with his eyes covered by contact
lenses and his mouth full of false teeth, Jim Carrey is, nevertheless,
delightfully zany. Production designer Michael Corenblith has created
a visual Who world worthy of the genius of Theodor S. Geisel, who
wrote as Dr. Seuss. Clustered like a medieval European village,
Whoville's haystack houses are decorated with, literally, thousands of
twinkling lights. Rick Baker's make-up and Rita Ryack's padded
costumes, particularly the hats, are inspired, and James Horner's
music is terrific. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dr. Seuss'
How THE GRINCH Stole Christmas" is a classic 10. Children will adore
it, teens will find it hip, and adults will flock back to see it. This
magical package of pure pleasure leaves you a bit happier to be
alive. Don't miss it!

Up on Wholywood Hill, over at Whoniversal
A most challenging film was beginning rehearsal --
A live-action, big-budget, super-sensation
Headlined by The Grinch, Dr. Seuss's creation.
As both book and cartoon, people loved the Yule tale,
But a feature-length Grinch?
It must certainly fail.
Now fans of a hand-drawn Grinch might say, of course,
That this version strays much too far from the source.
Yes, it's true that Ron Howard's film plays fast and loose
With the text and the themes and the verse a la Seuss,
But there's plenty of reason to feel bright and merry
At the pleasures of watching the Grinch a la Carrey.
In Whoville the story begins, as it should,
With a young-ish Who girl who thinks things aren't so good.
With Christmastime bustle abuzz in the town,
Cindy Lou sees priorities quite upside-down.
Played by young Taylor Momsen, this sweet-natured lass
Is ready to give all the presents a pass
And reach out in true Christmas spirit and joy
To the Grinch, who once lived among Whos as a boy.
As part of the back-story, added for drama
We learn that the Grinch suffered some Christmas trauma
And fled to a mountain away from these creatures
Where he grew to adulthood with Jim Carrey's features.
After one failed attempt at a Grinchy inclusion
In Who celebrations, he's back to seclusion
To plot, as we know, stealing all Christmas treasures
So no one might have any holiday pleasures.
The film-makers make a true Seussian world
Where arches may tilt and where storefronts are curled.
>From the bright, shiny colors and odd camera angles
To makeup and hairstyles and costumes with spangles,
The style of THE GRINCH is true Seuss, first to last.
But this twist on the narrative ...
Well, not so fast.
In stretching the story an hour and more,
The screenwriters miss what the tale was before.
Here the Whos are the ones who have so much to learn
And the Grinch, in a quite unpredictable turn,
Isn't just by his far-too-small ticker afflicted.
He's misunderstood, under-loved and conflicted.
The character isn't improved by the shift;
Imagine a mean one who's just slightly miffed.
This misguided Grinch psychological stuff
Might have sunk the whole enterprise quickly enough
If not for the singular sardonic spin
Of Jim Carrey under his green Grinchy grin.
THE GRINCH is his show, and he's up to the task
With the same inspiration we saw in THE MASK.
Whenever he's left to his improvisations,
His facial and physical manipulations,
THE GRINCH is a triumph of comic invention
(Though many jokes won't reach a kid's comprehension).
The rapid-fire gags and sly insider wit
Are almost all funny, nearly every last bit.
It's true that this GRINCH may have some firm detractors
Who hate the whole notion of Whos played by actors,
Or those who think classics should be left alone
And not be big-budgeted and over-blown.
It's equally true that the loss of some verse
In favor of prose is a change for the worse.
This isn't the Grinch of the Seussian vision,
And giving him "depth" proves a silly decision
But all is forgiven when Carrey takes flight
Delivering lines with that wonderful bite.
A true timeless classic this film may not be;
It's simply a package of holiday glee.
On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 green parties:  7.

It's the same old story the Doc published back in 1957, but with some
tweaking. The Grinch's grinchiness back-story is told and wha'da'ya'know
there's a love interest involved. Also, little Cindy Lou isn't simply the
sweet faithful who of yester-century; this who's got some Christmas
suspicions of her own, "Presents? Isn't that superfluous?" Later she sings,
"Did Christmas change or was it just me?" The maturing child perspective
makes a nice addition to the collection of Holiday tales.
Bumpy, but fun second and third acts follow a very rough first act.
Translating a fictional cartoon into fictional cartoony live-action is a
daunting unforgiving task that this first act does not make look effortless.
Whoville will take some time to get used to and the silly bustling of whos
spills over with silly gags unable to carve a smile on the average adult.
But, Jim Carrey's resilient spirit, rubber bones, and love of charades,
carries the production like an over-packed sack of toys up the steep
slippery slope. Though, two sizes too small, it's his heart that saves the
show.
A couple of the more notably riotous elements include the Grinch trying with
all his might to scare the unscareable, ultimately adorable Cindy Lou and
the Grinch's cave from crawling socks to self-defeating answering machine.
Speaking of machines, kudos to the set and prop designers. Kids will love
the wacky mechanization.
Speaking of speaking, I swear Carrey's cheers scare up a share of the vocal
wares of one Sean Connery imitating Mr. Magoo. Whoever, it works.
Interestingly, the press notes are careful to point out that Carrey "with no
accompaniment or anything to alter his voice" sang the signature song
"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch" from the 1966 animated classic. I must say,
Carrey's absolutely splendid vocal work on that musical piece pulls together
one of the film's strongest moments.
Incidentally, Theodor S. Geisel (Dr. Seuss), content with the 1966 version,
turned down any following offers to bring "The Grinch" into live-action.
After his death in 1991, his wife Audrey likewise shook her head at all
proposals ... until this one, that is.

Rated PG, 102 minutes
Though the vicious halls of elementary school are known as breeding grounds 
for cruel treatment, no teasing was as mean or strangely inane as what our 
green fiend experienced in his childhood. It turns out the reason the boy got 
so fed up with Christmas in the first place was because he lacked shaving 
skills. Darn those razor blades! Oh yes, you heard me correctly. The young 
Grinch (Jim Carrey) once attended school with sweetheart Martha May Who-vier 
(Christine Baranski) and future major of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor). The 
little major thinks Martha's his girl, and convinces his classmates the 
Grinch is hairy, ugly, and stupid, but Martha May's turned off by his mean 
ways. The Grinch tries his hand at a razor blade to remove the unwanted hair, 
and appeal to Martha. He gets cuts all over his face, and is subjected to 
public mockery the next day, so he furiously flees town to a nearby mountain 
and disappears forever. He still induces fear in the townspeople. 
Why take such a long time to explain this small plot detail? Because it's 
filler, and that's exactly what most of this movie is. Except for a few 
inspired new moments, this holiday family film really doesn't deserve the 
title of "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch", "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch...Sort Of" is more 
accurate.
Years after the shearing incident, the town of Whoville is preparing for the 
Whobilation, a grand town anniversary coinciding with Christmas. The Major 
keeps citizens in order, hoping the Grinch won-t swarm down from his alp lair 
to foil activities. He does his share to encourage anti-Grinch propaganda, 
but is the emerald guy really so bad? One child, Little Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor 
Momsen) wants to find out. Confused by the true meaning of Christmas, she 
seeks for good in the Grinch's two-sizes-too-small heart. What she finds will 
only surprise you if you've watched no television around Christmas since 1966 
or read no books as a child.
But that's treating the movie too seriously and cynically. If one looks past 
extra patches of story, the result is quite magical. Production values are 
high and simply gorgeous with lush detail throughout the crazy world of 
Whoville. Every building has some kooky feature, and all characters a strange 
characteristic. You know it's a showy, flimsy film set, but it convinces as a 
city. In this year's Best Makeup Oscar category, makeup artist Rick Baker 
looks to be competing against himself. Whether his work in "Nutty Professor 
II: The Klumps", or the masterful job he does here will win is unsure. 
Regardless, he makes the movie much better than it could have been. Carrey 
contorts inside his extremely painful suit of lime-dyed yak hair and numerous 
face pieces with charming vigor. It makes for the year's most unique 
performance. He finds a suiting role better than his dual job in "Me, Myself 
& Irene". With no big contenders this year, "The Grinch" could finally mean 
an Oscar nomination for its star. The Whos look awesome too. They have long 
animal snouts, and each 90 some Who has completely different facial features. 
Watching a special on E! (I'm not quite above watching that network), and 
seeing every step taken to get the movie to feel and appear just right, it's 
downright amazing what they did. 
Jim Carrey sings the original Grinch song with panache and no voice 
alteration other than the mouthpiece he already wears for the role. Among 
other treats include the Grinch doing a dead-on imitation of a director 
(presumably Ron Howard). Anthony Hopkins's key speaking role as the narrator 
gets handled with care and grace, an excellent choice.
Yet there's that extra story. It sticks out like a jagged icicle waiting for 
Sharon Stone's ice pick. Seuss's wife, who gave Howard rights for the film 
after waiting out for near eternity, had some control over the film. She 
demanded certain bathroom humor scenes be removed, a thankful thing. She 
apparently, however, had no power over the overall story. And what happens? 
The message gets muddled. 
Watch the original 1966 television program before seeing the film to remind 
yourself as to the intention of its brilliant late author. After that, see 
the film. Despite its flaws, this is something you must see.
Early in the film Little Cindy's mother Betty Lou Who (Molly Shannon) is 
competing with Martha May in a Christmas light contest. Stringing bright 
lights as fast as possible with severe difficulty, Betty stops for a moment 
to talk with Martha about her fairly unadorned home display. Martha shows her 
a large Christmas light machine gun that shoots and staples illuminators to 
her house with stylish ease. Betty looks on, horrified. It's a classic moment 
in a film that could have been so.

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  He's as ugly as a
cactus and as charming as an eel.  Living atop the
windy peak of Mount Crumpit, he peers out onto the
town of Whoville far below.  He's a solitary
curmudgeon whose sole source of enjoyment comes from
making life miserable for others, especially during
the holiday season.  Loathing their Christmas spirit
with their bright lights, non-stop singing, gift
giving, and general sense of gaiety, he devises a plan
to rob Whoville of their most precious holiday.
However, his foul mission is thwarted by the
kindhearted actions of little Cindy Lou Who  (adorable
Taylor Momsen).  In a chance encounter with the Grinch
(an unrecognizable Jim Carrey), she believes that he's
not all bad despite what the rest of the town thinks. 
With her wide-eyed innocence, she hopes to bring out
his warm side hidden under all that green fur and
callous demeanor.
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a slightly revved
up version of the Dr. Seuss bedtime classic. 
Richly narrated by Anthony Hopkins, the film follows
the original basic outline.  However, it comes up
short on imagination and has lost a touch of its
sentimental spirit. 
You would expect more in terms of design, considering
the Grinch universe takes place within a snowflake. 
The Whoville denizens look and act like mannequins. 
They possess hog-like snouts and sport a hairstyle
that looks like it was the result of a passing
cyclone.  And for a town that seems to be in a 24/7
preparation mode for Christmas, the whole place looks
oddly somber.  There is a noticeable lack of primary
colors, the palettes seem muted, and the entire set
design seems like something out of CandylandÂor the
backlot of Universal Studios.  Of course, there are
some terrific special effects.  And its strongest
segment occurs when the Grinch goes on his raid during
Christmas Eve.  He employs a giant vacuum to suck out
the goodies, unleashes moths to eat the hanging
Christmas stockings, and even steals the visions of
sugarplums dancing in their heads.  But up to that
point, there's very little magic in the air.
Another shortfall was that the film didn't do enough
to generate enough sympathy for the Grinch.  Yes, we
learn of the Grinch's past and the root of his hatred
for Christmas and Whoville, but it spends an
inordinate amount of time establishing his meanness. 
This disqualifies the film from being a wholesome
child's tale, and moves it into dark territory that
may leave wee ones confused. Among other things, he
pushes little kids to the ground during a sack race
and eats shards of glass while he plots against the
town of Whoville.  This is a bad hero/role model for
children if they tend to mimic what happens on-screen.
Yet, the film has flashes of creativity, and kudos are
in order for Jim Carrey who worked exceptionally hard
to pull off this almost-impossible role.  Despite
being mummified under that green suit, he still
applies his unique brand of physical comedy while
snarling, growling, and scowling, and does his best to
show us a good time.
The movie does have its funny moments even if its
grander aspirations are unrealized.  
But it needed to be brighter to captivate and more fun
to enthrall.  
Like the Grinch who felt hatred towards those who had
him ostracized,
This film's heart is two sizes too small.

Three things you should know about Bammer, before we get started:
    -Generally, remixes grind my gizzard.
    -Jim Carrey and his extremely-over-the-top clowning gets on
     my *last* nerve.
    -Dr. Seuss was one of the first heroes I had; hell, he
     Spoke For The Trees before treehuggers were even thought of!
     Mess with him, and somebody's Feelings are gonna get hurt.
So, I probably loathed Jim Carrey's remix of Dr. Seuss' cartoon, "How
The Grinch Stole Christmas", right?  Maybe.  Maybe not.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
He's a Mean One: Mr. Grinch.
In this updated version of the classic tale by Dr. Seuss, The Grinch
(Jim Carrey) has Issues.  He doesn't like all the noise that his
Whoville neighbors 'round the way make - especially the Christmasy noise
they make.  The Grinch, frankly, doesn't like Christmas.
The concept of which astonishes young Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Mumsen) -
though she's having Issues of her own over the commercialization of
Christmas.  Cindy sees her father, Lou Lou-Who (Bill Irwin) buying up
Christmas stuff left and right, her mother, Betty Lou Who (Molly
Shannon) in fierce Christmas light-stringing competition with Martha May
Who-vier (Christine Baranski), and the Maywho of Whoville (Jeffrey
Tambor) discriminating against the Misunderstood Grinch because the
Maywho's beloved Martha once had a Thing for Grinchybaby, and Cindy is
left to wonder just what Christmas is about.
The Grinch has no doubts, though: for him, Christmas is about being
tortured by the Whos, a practice that started when he was yet a wee
Grinch (Josh Ryan Evans).  But this year will be different; this year,
The Grinch and his dog, Max, will stop Christmas for good...
The Upshot:
Quite a few things about THE GRINCH were exactly as I thought, and even
hoped, they would be: director Ron Howard obviously put a lot of love
and care into this project; certainly, he and his production team put a
lot of moolah into set design and costumes.  I also imagined narrator
Anthony Hopkins sonorous voice would pick up where the original cartoon
"Grinch" narrator - Boris Karloff - left off.  Hope against hope, the
key song - "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" - was updated just enough to
be jazzy, but still remained true to the original (ok, I'll admit it: I
liked Carrey's version even *more* than the original song.  Who knew he
could actually sing?).  Overall, my hopes that this production would
remain true to Seuss' Whoville, weren't shattered.
It's where they veered off of Seuss' beaten path, that rankled me.
That, and Jim Carrey being allowed off-leash without a pooper scooper to
clean up behind him.
For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why they decided to explain
Why The Grinch, Grinched.  Some stuff just *is*; let it be, I say -
especially if you're gonna explain it like this flick did.  Needless to
say, my eyes rolled.  Also, I like my Whos unspoiled by Y2K
sensibilities; it twisted my liver that the Maywho was allowed to be
Evil, and sneakily so.  Totally ruined the "everybody comes out for
Christmas any old way" theme for me.
And - can I just say this? - if I never see Taylor Mumsen in another
movie again, it'll be too soon.  Her saccharine-coated Cindy Lou Who
reminded me of the mouse in STUART LITTLE.  And, oooh, I *hated* the
mouse in STUART LITTLE.  Yes, I realize that Cindy Lou is probably
charming the socks off America right now, but I just feel sticky after
being dunked in all that Sweetness And Light.  Ya know what?  I didn't
*care* why she was Conflicted about What Christmas Really Meant.  I just
wanted her gone, gone, *gone*!
Uh...sorry if I got any on ya.  Lest ye think I didn't really like the
movie, ye would be right for those thirty or so minutes that Carrey went
hog-wild without any sense of direction.  And it showed; many of his
shticky bits should've been edited out, no matter how Wacky or Inspired
his antics seemed.  There were far too times when Carrey just went manic
onscreen, but no one in the packed audience went along with him.  But
there were enough good bits of his to generally balance the movie out;
though there were some questionable scenes that I didn't feel were
appropriate for the child-skewed audience [is there a clause that Carrey
puts in his movie contracts that states he must, at some point, crack a
butt-joke?], it's clearly the younger set that will eat this movie up,
and will probably demand an update of the remake.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I'm sure it can't be easy being a Hollywood Filmmaker; they can be boxed
into a damned if you do/damned if you don't corner: if they sprinkle a
few Blacks (and since We're still the Default Minority, it'll probably
remain "a few *Blacks*") in their productions, some folks will scream
"TOKENISM!!!".  But if they *don't* include Blacks, the scream becomes
"WHERE THE BLACK FOLKS AT?".  I don't envy Howard et al their decision,
and maybe the result should just be seen as the "Grinch" Powers That Be
having taken the high road.
But still: Black "Whos", for me, was about as weird a sight as, say,
Black Vulcans.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
I'll make about the safest prediction a non-prognosticator ever made:
based on the huge crowds I saw here in Podunkville this weekend, THE
GRINCH will be a monster hit the likes we haven't seen in awhile.  And I
won't begrudge them that: for folks who weren't weaned on the
originator, the duplicator will do just fine.  Really, it wasn't all
that bad, and in some spots (most notably when The Grinch found out he
was nominated for an award), Carrey Wrecked Stuff! (quick Blactionary
definition: "In a few noteworthy scenes, Carrey was amazing!").  Still,
I think I'll stick with the original for now - and maybe when "Grinch"
comes on DVD, I might fast-forward through Cindy Lou's
saccharine-coating and Jim Carrey's fatty hamming.
THE GRINCH (rating: flashing yellowlight):
Just call me Mrs. Grinch...

HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) / ***
Directed by Ron Howard. Screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman,
based on the book by Dr. Seuss. Starring Jim Carrey, Taylor Momsen,
Jeffrey Tambor. Running time: 105 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed 
on December 16th, 2000.
I have mixed feelings about the new big-screen version of Dr Seuss' "How 
The Grinch Stole Christmas". Don't get me wrong -- it's a very funny, very 
entertaining movie, and kids and adults alike should enjoy it. No, my 
problem (such as it is) is that, if I had to associated one name with the 
film, it would not be Dr Seuss'. Undeniably, that name would be Jim 
Carrey's.
More so than any of his previous pictures, Carrey owns "The Grinch". All 
its wit, drama, energy is derived from him. When Carrey isn't on-screen, 
the movie loses much of its appeal; it feels like a symphony missing its 
brass and string sections, both at once. And this is a problem only 
inasmuch as it makes a liar out of the film's advertising: this is not Dr 
Seuss' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", but rather the same story 
filtered through Carrey's singular sense of humour.
Carrey, of course, plays the Grinch -- a green, hairy creature who lives 
atop fang-like Mount Crumpit, in a home littered with the garbage of the 
Whos. The Whos live in Whoville, at the base of the mountain, and they are 
as unlike the Grinch as it is possible to be. Where the Grinch is mean and 
scornful, the Whos are happy and carefree. And no time is more full of 
jollity in Whoville than Christmastime. Christmas is part of every apsect 
of the Whos' lives. They decorate for it, sing songs about it, and most
importantly, they shop for it. Every Who loves Christmas.
Every Who, that is, except little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who has 
begun to question just why all the presents and ornaments and parades are 
supposed to make her happy. When none of the other Whos understand her 
concerns, Cindy Lou seeks out the one person she thinks might feel the 
same way: the Grinch. But in doing so, Cindy Lou reawakens old memories in 
the Grinch, of childhood rejection by town beauty Martha May Whovier 
(Christine Baranski) and humiliation by Mayor May Who (Jeffrey Tambor). 
This inspires the Grinch's infamous plot to steal Christmas from Whoville.
If there's one element of the story that director Ron Howard managed to 
keep true to Dr Seuss' vision, it is its actual appearance. Dr Seuss books 
are famous for their slightly off-kilter visual style, and Howard and 
production designer Michael Corenblith have not departed too much from 
"The Grinch"'s Seussian origins. The Whos look like regular humans, just a 
little warped (they have strange hairstyles, big noses, and rosy cheeks). 
Whoville is not dissimilar from a regular town -- if that town's chief 
architect had been Rube Goldberg. Everything is a riot of colour and 
activity and Christmas.
Also well conceived is Carrey's Grinch costume. Not only does this hew 
very closely to the Dr Seuss original, it also permits Carrey an almost 
full range of movement and facial expressions. And, given the animation 
the actor puts into his role, this is of key importance. Had the decision 
been made simply to slap Carrey in a mask, for example, "The Grinch" would 
not be nearly so successful.
The Grinch may be for Jim Carrey what the Genie in "Aladdin" was for Robin 
Williams: the ultimate expression of the actor's comic strengths. Carrey 
has it all here -- a character who is at once caustic and sympathetic, who 
is unbridled in what antics he can indulge himself in. Carrey's humour 
ranges from the obvious to the sublime (when a Whoville taxi won't stop to 
pick him up, he facetiously wails, "It's because I'm GREEN, isn't it?"). 
Only occasionally does he resort to sophomoric gross-out comedy. There
are hints of several past Carrey characters in the Grinch -- definite 
helpings of Ace Ventura, for example, and the Hank persona from "Me, 
Myself & Irene" -- leading one to believe that this is the role Carrey's 
comedic career has been building up to.
Unfortunately, though, none of the other performers can hope to match up. 
Tambor in particular tries gamely, but his Mayor lacks much depth. As for 
Momsen, she does passably well in the film's second-most important role, 
but fails to make as strong an impression as she should. Cindy Lou is made 
out to be intelligent and individualistic, but Howard seems far too 
interested in just playing up her cuteness. Anthony Hopkins, meanwhile, 
makes a good successor to Boris Karloff as the Narrator. His precise, 
sonorous tones sweep the audience instantly into the tale.
The Dr Seuss book has, of course, been greatly expanded in order to turn 
it into a feature-length film. Amongst the more notable additions made by 
screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman are a series of flashbacks 
to the Grinch's own youth, providing motivation for the character's nasty 
ways. Intriguingly, this somewhat subverts the original Seuss story, 
moving it away from its obvious Dickensian roots. Instead of simply 
telling the tale of a mean man who discovers joy in the spirit of 
Christmas, "The Grinch" is now more about accepting people's differences 
(although the original moral has not been totally dismissed, either). 
Combined with its staunchly anti-commercial streak, the film feels both 
more relevant and more substantial as a result.
Although some have suggested that "The Grinch" is too dark and 
mean-spirited for children, I don't believe this is really the case. 
Parents of very sensitive children may find the film inappropriate, but in 
general, it is suitable for the entire family, with plenty to offer young 
and old. Those who are approaching the movie expecting it to simply be the 
book (or 1960s TV version) writ large may be caught off-guard by the 
pervasiveness of Carrey's influence. But Carrey fans, and Seuss 
afficiandos prepared to accept a mild departure from the source material,
should find "The Grinch" to be a hugely entertaining Christmas movie.
So go see "The Grinch", and just you wait and see:
Yes, even your heart might grow a size, or two, or three.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas  (2000)
Let's face it, Ron Howard's feature film adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book HOW 
THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS cannot take the place of Chuck Jones' cartoon 
version, Boris Karloff at the helm as the narrator and Grinch.
That doesn't mean that Howard's version is not good.  It should remind us, 
however, that humans hold a jaded eye on newcomers:  you'll never be as good 
as the person you're replacing, we would like to get in someone's face and 
say Â and sometimes we do.
Aside from spots of slow pacing, the 2000 HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is 
just fine.  The good doctor's message still comes across Â the Christmas 
season has become too commercialized, and what matters most is not material 
Â and we're given even more whimsical lore at which to chuckle.
Word has it that Mrs. Geisel, the author's widow, was around to approve or 
nix modern tweaks on her husband's work Â read, thank goodness for less 
potty humor!  The major readjustments of plot involve the Grinch's early 
years, specifically, the events that added enough bile to his personality to 
match the green fur covering his body.  Certainly another timeless message 
imparted by the story is tolerance.  When we see the new babies floating 
down to  Whoville, their pristine bassinets suspended from colorful 
umbrellas, we are struck by the infant Grinch's plight.  His cradle and 
umbrella are drab and torn, and more importantly, his appearance and manner 
are vastly different from the norm in Whoville.  Indeed, the movie tilts a 
bit heavily in the direction of correctness, though its visual richness 
coats the morals in sweetness.
The sets are among the major stars of the film.  The aerial shots of 
Whoville are stunning, the crazy cottages nestled among the snow-covered 
hills, all overlooked by the wave-like crest of Mount Crumpit Â home of the 
Grinch.  The lair of this green legend is wondrous as well.  Worked up with 
contraptions worthy of Rube Goldberg, replete with Seussian silliness, the 
cave gives us lots of candy for the eyes; what's best is that the 
furnishings are grounded in dark humor, so we are not overcome by sickly 
sentiment.
Too bad the movie's slowest moments come early in the narrative, and mostly 
in the cave.  Meant surely as characterization, many minutes are filled with 
the Grinch grumping around his pad, his self-loathing as prominent as his 
loathing for the Whos who rejected him in his youth.  Speed it up, Mr. 
Howard!
I am not mentioning the star of the film until this, paragraph number seven. 
  Perhaps this is because he is overpaid for his films Â a curious irony in 
this particular work.  Jim Carrey is cast perfectly in this role.  Director 
Howard seems to have set him free in a good deal of scenes, though a few of 
these should have been cut, as mentioned earlier.  Anyhow, Carrey is 
marvelously goofy in his body English, speaking perfectly in this 
quintessentially grouchy role.  I suppose I should not hold a grudge against 
actors or athletes because of how many millions they carry away: it's the 
teams and studios that are run by free agency and its cousin avarice.
Anthony Hopkins is the designated deliveryman of the British accent.  His 
voice over narration ends up sturdy but unremarkable.
The supporting cast strengthens this expanded version of the Grinch story.  
Jeffrey Tambor is always a sure character actor, and his mayor of Whoville 
is nicely haughty and short-sighted.  Christine Baranski as Martha May 
Whovier is the aging beauty who once loved the grumpy green guy.  Perhaps 
the best support is lent by Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.  Her cuteness 
never gets in the way of her acting ability.
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is a good film to see during the holiday 
season.  It will also make a good addition to any collection of videos or 
DVDs.  Just remember to be tolerant, and regard the movie not as an upstart 
out to upstage the original, but as an update designed to deliver the same 
delicious message.

Nobody has ever made a feature-length film based on a Dr. Seuss book,
and you'd better believe that nobody has ever been crazy enough to
attempt a live-action version of the good doctor's stories.  The reason
for this becomes painfully evident almost immediately in How the Grinch
Stole Christmas.  The sets are horrendously cheap-looking.  It seems as
though the filmmakers were going for a Willy Wonka & the Chocolate
Factory effect, but the overall gaudiness of everything smacks of the
last two Batman films.  And the fact that it took over $120 million to
make a film based on a 70-page book is a little alarming as well.
Luckily, Jim Carrey is a strong enough star to overcome the rest of this
mess.  The Grinch, based on Seuss' 1957 children's classic, will
probably be a big commercial hit no matter what any critics think. Which
brings up another interesting point Â Seuss' story is supposed to be a
rallying cry against the commercialism of the holidays, but you can bet
your ass the film will have product placement tie-ins out the wazoo.  At
the end of the book, The Grinch sheepishly admits `maybe Christmas
doesn't come from a store,' but they're the only place you'll be able to
get your official Grinch merchandise.
Carrey (Me, Myself & Irene) stars as the titular Grinch, a green-fur-
covered, onion-eating creep with a heart two sizes too small.  He lives
on the mountain peak that overlooks Whoville, a town full of cheerful
people known as Whos (they're all pretty freaky looking in the face,
hair and teeth departments).  Whoville loves Christmas, as evidenced by
its residents shopping up a storm in the film's opening scene.  For the
holiday, Whoville celebrates something called a Who-biliation, and this
year marks the festival's 100th anniversary.
We learn the origin of The Grinch Â a funny tale added here to pad the
film's running time - but the film's main focus is on the relationship
between the cold-hearted Grinch and precocious little Cindy Lou-Who
(Taylor Momsen).  She seems to be the only person in Who-ville
interested in giving the green grump another chance at redeeming his
social status in town.  Despite the girl's good intentions, The Grinch
still raids the town on Christmas Eve, absconding with everything
related to the holiday and hauling it up to the top of his mountain.
The Grinch started to get on my nerves after about 30 minutes, but then
Carrey's screen time was increased, which jump-started my interest in
the film.  He really saves the movie when it starts to slip off the
tracks. That said, Carrey's rendition of Burl Ives' `You're a Mean One,
Mr. Grinch' is a disaster, but the montage of him creating various evil
devices are pretty cool despite the song.  Momsen's gut-wrenching
rendition of the James Horner (Titanic) penned `Christmas, Why Can't I
Find You,' is much more enjoyable.  The film is at its best when it
sticks to the book's original narrative, provided here by Sir Anthony
Hopkins (M:I-2).
Although he didn't seem to affect many of the kids at my screening of
the film, this Grinch would have scared the crap out of me if I were a
little kid (my fear of the Hamburglar almost turned me into a child
vegetarian).  When was the last time you took your kids to a movie that
featured a $20 million star wearing a big, furry codpiece?  Plus, The
Grinch has piercing yellow eyes (so help me, God, yellow eyes).  Anybody
who knows anything about decent Christmas films knows this is the sign
of pure anti-holiday evil (see A Christmas Story Â a real holiday
classic).
Like Battlefield Earth, there aren't many shots in The Grinch that
aren't off-kilter.  The effect is annoying, and makes it look like
director Ron Howard (Edtv) and crew were filming during an avalanche.
Howard predominately uses the same production team he's worked with on
his previous films, but he's never made a picture quite like The Grinch
before.  The sets looked like they'd collapse under the weight of a wee
kitten.
For some reason, Audrey Geisel (Seuss' widow) gave Howard and his
production company the okay to make the film after years and years of
rebuffing Hollywood's attempt to make her husband's story into a
feature-length film (he, apparently, was pleased enough with the cartoon
version).  Geisel was able to finagle veto power over the film, putting
the kibosh on several jokes she referred to as `bathroom humor' (despite
signing off on the casting of Carrey) and a scene that sounded pretty
anti-Semitic (it involved the Who-SteinsÂseriously).  The offensive
material comes from the odious duo of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman
(Wild Wild West).

The pure enjoyment of any of Dr. Seuss' books is the heartfelt magic he brought to them, including "Cat in the Hat" or even good old Grinch. Chuck Jones's animated classic short from 1966 certainly had that in spades. Ron Howard's dull live-action version is a bland, overstuffed souffle, more likely to make you yawn than laugh. I've always been skeptical about a live-action version of the story since the animated short always did it so well in such a short running time. At 102 minutes, director Ron Howard is plowing all over the map with nothing to say. 
Jim Carrey is the Grinch, the lovable, sneaky, clever, furry, green-eyed being who lives atop Mount Crumpit, essentially an elf-shoe shaped peak atop garbage mountain overlooking Whoville. The Grinch hates Christmas, and he hates all the cheery Who denizens who live in Whoville (they even hold an annual Holiday Cheermeister award). The Whos live for Christmas, and they love to shop for gifts spending copious amounts of money (is there a message here about consumerism in America?) The Grinch hates these people so much that he takes a maniacal glee in trying to destroy their holiday spirit. In fact, I almost agreed with the Grinch's mean efforts. These Whos are joyless, frenetic people with pig snouts and no personality, and the flashback on how the Grinch became such a grouch entitles him to far more sympathy than probably intended. 
The film has no visual imagination whatsoever. Every shot is in close-up and it makes all the surroundings feel cramped and busy. The production design and art direction is washed-out at best with little sense of space or even any vivid colors - Whoville is so dully imagined that it reminded me of the colorless world from Barry Levinson's atrocious "Toys." No wonder the Grinch is so grumpy - his messy, dank domicile has more character and personality than anything in Whoville. 
Jim Carrey is fairly tolerable but his manic brand of humor and one-liners robs the film of any heart or soul and quickly proves tedious after awhile - I will say his final scene where he realizes what Christmas is really about proves what a good actor Carrey can be. Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier, the Grinch's former childhood love, delivers a little pizazz but she hardly snares much screen time. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, the only citizen who believes the Grinch is not as mean as he may look, has some tender moments, but most of the cast seems lost in the film's frenzied style.
What was needed for "The Grinch" was the impressive imaginings of Tim Burton, considering he created the story of the fabulous "Nightmare Before Christmas" back in 1993, a more comical take on the nature of Christmas. The original "Grinch" had style, flair and a sense of magic. This modernized version feels cold and dreary, like a soiled stocking left outside of Grinch's Mount Crumpit home.

In the most anticipated movie of the holiday season, Jim Carrey 
recreates Boris Karloff's famous Grinch role in HOW THE GRINCH STOLE 
CHRISTMAS.  Based on the well-known Dr. Seuss story, the Jim Carrey 
version, directed by Ron Howard (EdTV), is a live-action movie.  The 
1966 television original, an annual Christmas tradition in the Rhodes 
household, is an animated film.  Even if the remake pales in comparison 
to the original, it is a cute and funny movie in its own right.
As you probably know, the Grinch is a "bah humbug" kind of guy who tries 
to keep Christmas from coming to the sweet Whos by stealing all of their 
presents and decorations.  In a tribute to the original show and book, 
the remake keeps most of the lines but adds in more story in order to 
triple the length of the original half-hour show.  In a flashback to the 
Grinch's childhood, we finally get some insights into what made him into 
the quintessential crab.
Anthony Hopkins, as the narrator, is the perfect choice to replace Boris 
Karloff, whose voice was the best part of the original production.  With 
the exception of his speeding up and slurring a few lines, Hopkins 
provides a wonderful rendition of the Seuss rhyme.
In order to accurately recreate the Seuss images, production designer 
Michael Corenblith carefully reviewed the illustrations in all of the 
Seuss books.  With this knowledge he created a visual vocabulary in 
order to ensure that every tower and every bridge would be as close as 
possible to what Dr. Seuss would have imagined them.  The inventive 
result is a snow-covered cross between WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE 
FACTORY and THE WIZARD OF OZ.
Five-time Academy Award winner Rick Baker's special make-up effects turn 
Carrey into a creature bearing little resemblance to the man inside the 
suit.  Only Carrey's expressive mouth is recognizable.
The story's laughs come from both the gadgets and the dialog.  Martha 
May Whovier (Christine Baranski), for example, is able to outdo her 
neighbor Betty Lou Who (Molly Shannon) through the aid of a 
Gatling-style machine gun for shooting Christmas lights onto the outside 
of her house.
When the Grinch first checks his heart, he declares proudly, "Down a 
size and a half, and this time I'll keep it off."  This is a guy whose 
daily calendar entries include, "wallow in self-pity" and "solve world 
hunger -- tell no one."  Working against his desire for grumpiness is 
one little Cindy Lou Who, played sweetly by Taylor Momsen in her major 
motion picture debut.  She sees goodness in the Grinch that others 
don't.  And when he tries to scare her with massive screaming, she tells 
him, "Maybe you need a time out."
One of the funniest scenes occurs when the toddler Grinch is offered 
Christmas cookies on a plate made in the image of Santa Claus.  Biting 
off Santa's head rather than eating a cookie, the little Grinch 
announces, "Santa, bye-bye."
Sometimes, it's the small things that make a difference.  The sweet 
little dog, Max, in this version is a wonderful dog who acts and even 
looks kind of like the original.  I like that.
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS runs 1:38.  It is rated PG for crude 
humor and would be acceptable for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought this version was funnier than the 
original, but not better.  He gave it ***, mentioning how much he liked 
the gadgets.  His sole complaint was that only Cindy Lou Who and the 
Grinch were fully developed characters.

You know something, Christmas is not about presents.  It's about over-hyped 
holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins.  At least that 
would seem to be the message of "The Grinch," which has been advertised since 
last Christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores.  
Hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us 
about losing the true spirit of the season.
You know the plot:  there's this evil furry green guy called the Grinch (Jim 
Carrey) who lives on a mountain overlooking Whoville.  Down below all the 
Whos are preparing for their Whobilation, but the Grinch is determined to 
steal their Christmas.
The movie is, of course, a live-action version of the beloved children's 
book, which was previously adapted into a 1966 TV special by Looney Tunes 
animator Chuck Jones.  It's rare that a big budget Hollywood release is 
shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon, but that's the case when 
Jones' version is compared to Ron Howard's.  The TV Grinch hit all the right 
notes:  Boris Karloff's soft, deep narration; Thurl Ravenscroft singing "Mr. 
Grinch"; Max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head; 
and the Grinch's wide, toothless grin.
By contrast, the movie hits one sour note after another.  First, there are 
the numerous bad choices that Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman made in padding 
out the short book into a 105-minute movie.  Young wide-eyed Cindy Lou Who 
(Taylor Momsen) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents 
(Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon) during the holiday season.  She begins to 
sympathize with the Grinch, who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic.  
Cindy Lou discovers that the Grinch turned tearfully away from Whoville in 
grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for 
the prettiest girl in the class, Martha May Whovier (played as an adult by 
Christine Baranski).  Are we expected to like the Grinch, hate the Whos, and 
want him to steal Christmas?  The Grinch isn't even the villain here; that 
role is filled by the corrupt Mayor of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor) who was the 
Grinch's rival for Martha's affection.  Not only are the characters 
needlessly complex, but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the 
actual theft of Christmas seems like an afterthought.
The casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions.  Jim 
Carrey seems woefully miscast.  While his face is so supple that the rubber 
make-up seems superfluous, Carrey brings nothing else to the role.  His 
accent keeps changing; I assume he was shooting for Karloff, but he ends up 
sounding like a weird slurry of Richard Nixon, Sean Connery, and Cartman from 
"South Park."  Not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in 
the Grinch's home, Carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around 
Ace Ventura-style.  Needless to say, his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit 
the character of the Grinch, who is an embittered loner filled with hate.
Little Taylor Momsen brings little to role of Cindy Lou except big eyes and a 
cute smile.  She would have been fine if Cindy Lou was limited to her 
original purpose in the Seuss story (finding "Santa" in her living room 
stealing the tree).  However, the expanded script makes Cindy as important as 
the Grinch, and Momsen is not up to the challenge.
Bottom Line:  When you're stealing Christmas (movies), leave this one behind.

There has been a great deal of hoopla, over the past months, about the
coming of the big-screen recreation of the Grinch tale that debuted in 1966
as the Boris Karloff-narrated, Dr. Seuss classic. As everyone must know,
feel good director Ron Howard was teamed with zany Jim Carrey to bring the
animated tale to live action life and create the feature length fantasy,
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
The anticipation of this new rendition of the Christmas TV classic has
probably set expectations extremely high for fans who have eagerly awaited
the new Grinch. As such, I think that there may be some disappointment on
the entertainment horizon for many of us. And, I think this is due to our
fond memories of the original that color our recollection of that venerable
oeuvre. If you think about it, the original "Grinch" had four things going
for it - the Grinch, his faithful dog Max, the wonderful reading by Boris
Karloff and the brilliant imagination of Theodor S. Geisel, A.K.A. Dr.
Seuss. Beyond these four things (and the great songs - make that five
things), there are the Whos and they are really boring. The Whos could be
interchanged with Munchkins or Ewoks and it wouldn't have mattered. I never
liked any of the little buggers anyway.
In the modern remake, produced by longtime partners Howard and Brian
Grazer, we pretty much get the same thing, but with an attempt to flesh out
the Who society. Unfortunately and inexplicably, the Whos are shown from
the very start to be a culture of crass consumerism where buy, buy, buy is
the name of the game and the spirit of Christmas is completely lost -
except for little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen). The best things in the
movie are still the Grinch (Jim Carrey) and Max (Kelley), but there is an
effort to create a complete world on the screen.
Helmer Howard evokes a vision that is reminiscent of the one that Robert
Altman created in his interesting and artistic flop, "Popeye," with Robin
Williams. There, too, a fantasy world is built around a strange central
figure and is populated by all manners of cartoon creatures. In both films
the protagonists are loners who aren't accepted by society. The difference
between the two films, and the thing that will make the new flick a success
to Altman's ambitious failure, is Jim Carrey.
In a scant hour and a half or so of screen time, Carrey and makeup maestro
Rick Baker have created a living, breathing version of the creature that
came to life for so many of us in the Chuck Jones cartoon of 35 years ago.
Way back then, the Grinch became a sustained Christmas icon and Carrey and
crew have reinvented the creature whose heart "grew three times that day."
The best moments on the screen are when the Grinch is giving his mordant
soliloquies to no one save his faithful dog, Max. Remember how much you
liked Max in the original? You're going to like the new Max at least as
much, maybe more.
The Who world we are shown is glitzy and spangled with holiday cheer, but
it is a forced world, at best. The makeup for the adult Who population
takes on a feral quality that isn't very pleasant to look at and the petty
and selfish dealings of the Whoville mayor, May Who (Jeffrey Tambor), are
to be loathed. Only Cindy and her father Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin) come
across with any intelligence or integrity. Momsen may be a little too old
to be an appropriate Cindy Lou Who, but the young actress makes her a real
person, I mean, Who. The rest of the Who world are consumed by their
rampant Christmas buying and holiday competition. Cindy's mom, Betty Lou
Who (Molly Shannon), is obsessed with having the best Christmas light
display and competes fanatically with her neighbor Martha May Whovier
(Christine Baranski), who, we come to find out, has the hots for the
Grinch.
Tech credits beyond Rick Baker's marvelous makeup are first-rate. Whoville,
created by production designer Michael Corenblith, is bright and colorful
with a slight off-kilter look that keeps up the fantasy flavor of the film.
The Grinch's lair has all the paraphernalia necessary for him to perpetrate
his grand theft of Who Christmas, including the requisite antler to
disguise Max as a reindeer. High marks are due costume designer Rita Ryack
who creates a furry skin for Carrey that is a match for Baker's makeup.
Lenser Don Petermen does a yeoman's job capturing the action on film.
The part of the story that recreates the venerable 30 minute TV show and
shows the Grinch go from lonely ogre to loving friend of the Whos is
captured with care by the filmmakers. Those things that are invented
specifically for the film - Who society, the flashback story on how the
Grinch became the lonely creature he is - do not have the same imagination
as the original Dr. Seuss work and it shows.
The brilliant casting of Jim Carrey and the intelligence to allow the actor
to become the character are what make "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" a
must see for the holiday season. It is certainly going to be a staple for
holiday video watching that will be a perfect companion piece to the
original. Carrey gives one of the most memorable performances of his career
and is a new Grinch icon. I'm still not a fan of the Whos, though, and I
give it a B.

Bah humbug! It seems as though the season of cheer has arrived, along with
the bells, the whistles, the remake of a classic American Christmas
tale...huh?!? Stop the presses. Okay, so nobody really needed to renovate
this timeless cartoon featuring the memorable narration by Boris Karloff and
the symphonic rhymes of the Doctor they call Seuss, but alas, we're dealing
with Hollywood here, and classics equal money, right? Let's see how things
turned out.
PLOT:
The Grinch lives with his dog, up in a mountain, overseeing a town called
Whoville, inhabited by the happy-go-lucky Whos. The Whos are a joyous folk,
they love their Christmas and they are afraid of the Grinch. The Grinch
doesn't like the Whos or Christmas for that matter, and upon this very
evening, the Grinch has taken it upon himself to visit this little town, and
steal Christmas away from the Whos.
CRITIQUE:
Your appreciation of this film will likely hinge on whether or not you enjoy
the character of the Grinch in this movie, and for me, well, he just didn't
click. Carrey did play the character brilliantly but I just didn't think any
of his many shticks were funny. But I might be in the minority here because
many audience members around me (mostly kiddies) were crackin' up quite
some. To me, it just felt like Carrey doing his old MASK character in a
Grinch suit. I'm also a huge fan of the original story upon which this film
is based, and was quite disappointed with many of the over-the-top
"Hollywood" additions to the film. Like the prerequisite "bad guy" in
Whoville (where'd he come from?), the phony baloney romance with the Grinch
(you'd think that they could've come up with a better back story than the
fact that he was laughed at in school) and some of the kooky things that
they made the Grinch say ("The sun is right, and the powder's bitchin"?).
Brrrrrr. And what the heck happened to the classic "You're a Mean One"
song?!? Yikes! Bells and whistles don't always make things better, folks.
And despite a great "feeling" of Whoville all around, and solid effects to
boot, I wasn't sure if everything in this movie was supposed to look like
one big set filled with fake snow, or if that was just part of the whole
Whoville lore (looking conspiciously like Disneyworld's ToonTown, I might
add). But overall, I dug the "feel" of the film.
Mind you, it would've been nice to see more special effects added to the
film, to give it that extra level of fantasy. Any-who, don't let me
completely discourage you here because some of the elements in this film did
work. I liked the way that the whole thing was shot, much like a cartoon,
big and bulky and shiny and happy. I also loved the girl who played Little
Cindy Lou-Who, she was absolutely adorable! And the narration was another
highlight, hearing Anthony Hopkins deliver many of those classic lines felt
just right. But overall, the film seemed to be produced for a new generation
of Grinch fans. Children whose parents have stacked wallets to purchase
mucho Grinch products! And that is something I certainly won't
dispute...kids should really dig this flick! I don't generally compare
remakes to their originals, as I feel that every film should be critiqued
based on their own merits, but sadly I could not help but draw comparison
here, seeing as this was based on one of my personal favorite childhood
memories. Sigh. But even without those memories, this film simply didn't do
enough to win me over. If you like Carrey's Grinch character in this film,
with all of his one-liners, his exaggerated facial expressions et al, you
will probably enjoy this movie for what it is. A frivolous sock-hop at the
movie house. For me, the Grinch will always be that quiet, misunderstood
green dude at the top of that mountain. The guy with a mysterious past, an
uncertain future and a knack for meanness. Grinchy-poo, you used to be a
mean one...now you're just a goof. Sigh. Cha-chink.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:

Bryce Howard. And who's this Jeremy Howard? Any relation?
Hmmmm, I didn't notice him myself but Mini-Me, Verne Troyer, also has a part
in this movie.
Jim Carrey actually sings "You're a Mean One" in this film.

DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS
Earlier this year, Jim Carrey was the only reason to see "Me, Myself & Irene,"
a Farrelly Brothers mistep.  He's done it again.
Carrey simply *is* the Grinch, helped, of course, by Rick Baker's phenomenal
makeup design.  Whether he's gleefully tampering with Who mail ('jury duty,
pink slip, blackmail, eviction notice!'), going over his schedule
('4:00, wallow in self pity, 4:30, stare into the abyss') or lecturing
Max (Kelly, the film's other asset) on the art of being a reindeer, Carrey
had me sucked in.  However, when the focus shifts from Carrey, the movie
is abysmal.
Firstly, there's the story tampering.  We're given background as to how
the Grinch got this way (he was called names at school).  The Whos' Christmas
obssession has become crass commercialism, depressing Cindy Lou Who (newcomer
Taylor Momsen) to the point that she sings the maudlin 'Where Are You
Christmas?' mid-film.  The mayor (Jeffrey Tambor) is in a love triange
with Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski) and the Grinch!  Screenwriters
Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman ("Doc Hollywood") even have the poor
taste to include a couple of sex 'jokes' that seem seedy and woefully out
of place.
Secondly, there's the truly awful Whos (makeup again by Rick Baker).  They
look like rat-dogs.  Cindy Lou is too old and too normal looking in contrast
to the others.  Even the Grinch, when shown in flashbacks as a baby and an 
eight year old, looks awful, like a rejected monster from "Gremlins."
Thirdly, there's the art direction which is plastic and non-organic.
Whoville looks like Munchkinland crossed with the live action "Flinstones."  
I was always aware I was watching a soundstage covered in fake snow.  At one
point, the Grinch's quick entry/exit to Whoville is shown in an animated
sequence and the whole film is picked up for that one brief moment.  Otherwise
this is just a drab, grimy, bleak looking film.
I can't recommend "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" as a film,
although I can recommend Carrey's performance and the casting of Max the dog.
Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the
English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation,
a move the filmmakers should have avoided.

Dr. Suess' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" 
Christmas is that one time of year where everyone, regardless of their age, 
becomes a little kid. You get caught up in the excitement of it all - the 
decorations, the music, the get-togethers and of course the presents. 
Christmas stories usually work the same way so whether you've seen something 
for the second or one hundred and second time you can still enjoy it, but 
that is unlikely to be the case for you with this year's spin on Dr. Suess's 
"How The Grinch Stole Christmas." It's a live-action version of the classic 
children's book and cartoon show, but something's missing. It's only half as 
funny as it should be and the Christmas spirit it's supposed to radiate comes 
off as more of an advertisement to a theme park. 
The only reason this "Grinch" movie was made is because of its star: Jim 
Carey as the infamous spoiler of Christmas. If Carey hadn't signed on to this 
movie would it have been made? I doubt it considering 95 percent of the 
film's gags, jokes and one-liners are directly attributed to Carey's 
zaniness, goofiness and unflinching love of potty jokes. Director Ron Howard 
and his Imagine Entertainment production company do their best to synchronize 
the outrageous antics of Carey with the children's story and the result is a 
bit of a mixed bag. 
The basic story of "The Grinch" is about a mean green monster-looking guy who 
lives alone in a cave in the mountain overlooking Whoville. The village below 
is inhabited by human-like, cartoony characters with big noses, buck teeth, 
crazy hair styles and a mindset that rivals the Munchkins from "The Wizard of 
Oz." For some reason the Grinch hates Christmas while the Who's love it and 
he attempts to sabotage their holiday to crush their spirits but his plan 
backfires when the Who's carry on with their holiday as if nothing happened. 
Stretching this premise out to a full-length feature film seems like a 
difficult task and at times Howard and Co. do struggle to get as many of 
Carey's antics on screen as possible while still sticking to the main story. 
They introduce several sub-plots such as little Cindy Lou Who's (Taylor 
Momsen) constant inquiring about who the Grinch really is and her wondering 
if Christmas has gotten too commercial. Momsen is absolutely adorable as the 
little innocent girl and of course her questions are reflective of how our 
own society has made the holiday into more of an economic indicator than a 
joyous occasion for all mankind. The problem is this theme is simply plugged 
in where necessary and never really leaves much impact with you, especially 
at the end. 
The screenplay's story is a bit different from author Theodore Geisel's 
original. This time the Who's aren't so innocent, they've made Christmas into 
a cutthroat competition and even a sleazy mayor character is thrown in. This 
makes Cindy Lou's cuteness all that much more so - but only in a technical 
sense. She's fascinated with the Grinch, she wants to meet him and befriend 
him and try to change his mind about Christmas. There's a scene where this 
actually happens and the Grinch tries to scare her away like a monster would 
to Shaggy and Scooby Doo but she doesn't buy it. Cindy Lou's affection for 
the Grinch is so bizarre it's almost sick in a pedophile way. 
Along those lines there's also a sub-plot about Martha May Whovier (Christine 
Baranski) who had a crush on the Grinch as a child and still has feelings for 
him now. Since Whovier's supposed to be the bombshell character Baranski has 
the least makeup on and looks about 99% human compared to the other Who's. 
This is a problem with this film: it's inconsistent. After meeting the Grinch 
in person you'd think Cindy Lou would know all his tricks. During that famous 
scene where the Grinch, "disguised" as Santa Claus, breaks into her house and 
she catches him stealing the Christmas tree she actually doesn't recognize 
him! This is totally unbelievable and comes off as very trite. Even the 
3-year-old boy sitting in front of me at the cinema tugged on his dad's shirt 
and wondered aloud why Cindy Lou didn't realize Santa Claus was actually the 
Grinch (the father's answer: "shhh!"). 
But I digress, I've come all this way and haven't mentioned much about Carey. 
Is he funny? Is he outrageous? Is he a convincing Grinch? I guess the answer 
to all three would be yes, but with reservations. Carey is basically playing 
his "Ace Ventura" character but toned down for children, this is a PG movie 
after all. Thus, to be outrageous he has to do a lot of yelling and spout of 
lines that are really only funny on a Saturday morning cartoon. He gets to 
say a lot lines that are in synch with pop culture now, but 5 or 10 years 
from now will be dated and that does not a classic make. It's funny on paper, 
but as an adult watching this you're just thinking: "yeah that's funny, but 
why aren't I laughing?" 
The answer might be because it's familiar and comes off as contained. C'mon 
Carey, go wild! But that would mean we'd get a PG-13 movie and Geisel's 
widow, who had the final decision over almost all aspects of this film, wouldn
't have liked that. I can understand her logic and I agree with it, which 
means Imagine Entertainment should have taken a different approach to "The 
Grinch" altogether.

It was only a matter of time before the late, great Theodor S. Geisel's 
classic 1957 children's book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," which later 
was turned into a television special that has become an unforgettable part of 
many people's holiday rituals, would be adapted into a full-length feature 
film. The story is highly visual and pleasing, with a clean-cut premise that 
concludes with an important moral that all children, and adults, can relate 
to and understand. There is a reason, however, why the popular television 
special was only 25 minutes long. In the tradition of all of Dr. Seuss' 
books, the tale is simplistic and just short enough to be read the whole way 
through at bedtime. In turning it into a 98-minute motion picture, the 
"Grinch" that we have all grown to know only comes into effect in the final 
half-hour, with a whole preceding hour of padding that becomes problematic.
Ever since the Grinch (Jim Carrey) was little, he struggled to fit in with 
all of the other Whos down in Whoville, but his offbeat personality and 
green, hairy body worked against him. Now an adult who lives upon the 
mountain that looms over the snow-covered city, the Grinch has become little 
more than a myth to the townspeople, who treat him as if he was the Loch Ness 
Monster or Bigfoot whenever he goes out in public. Furthermore, his attitude 
doesn't help matters--the Grinch is purposefully a dastardly troublemaker who 
seems to hate everything and everybody, with a daily planner that includes 
things such as looking into the abyss and searching "for a way to solve world 
peace--tell no one."
As Christmas looms on the horizon, and the Whos anxiously buy loads of 
presents and work on their decorations, the Grinch becomes all the more 
restless to not let them get away with another holiday gone by without a 
hitch. Enter little Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor Momsen), who is also having a bit 
of Christmas doubt, as she witnesses everyone around her absorbed with 
gift-buying and receiving, yet is determined to reassure herself that the 
holiday should mean more to everyone. Making her way up to the Grinch's lair, 
Cindy Lou is not afraid of him, but amused, as she sees the sweetness just 
screaming to get out behind his cold, yellow eyes and monstrous exterior.
Following a plan of Cindy Lou's that ultimately goes awry and sends the 
Grinch reeling back to his cave with even more anger than before, the movie 
finally takes off where the famed Dr. Seuss story begins. It is also at this 
point that the film picks up its pace and grows truly involving and magical. 
With only a matter of time before the Grinch realizes his mistakes, and the 
Whos inevitably discover that Christmas isn't about what you receive, but who 
you've got in your life, the picture finds its footing and climaxes on a 
warm-hearted and lovely note.
What comes before this point is, unfortunately, flawed. Director Ron Howard 
(1989's "Parenthood") obviously shows an adoration for the story he is 
telling, but it is the screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman that 
proves fairly uneven. The first hour, whose purpose is to develop the 
Grinch's backstory and discuss just what made him who he is today, seems like 
unnecessary time-filler and is almost eventless. What is most misguided, 
though, is the treatment of the Whos, who are not at all like they were in 
the original story. Looking as if their original physical chemistry involved 
a mouse and a human breeding, the Whos are so materialistic, and the 
supporting characters so underdeveloped, that it leaves a sense of cold 
disattachment hanging over the proceedings. Where the townspeople should be 
lovable characters, they almost deserve every "bad" thing that the Grinch 
does to them. It is only at the end that the Whos, as well as the Grinch, 
have a life-changing epiphany that almost makes you want to forgive their 
previous actions--but not quite.
In Jim Carrey, "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" has found a star 
attraction who completely runs the show. Carrey, unrecognizable behind mounds 
of green makeup and latex but with the same delightfully manic energy that he 
usually has, evokes a great deal of sympathy from his well-known grinchy 
character, despite his evil deeds. Just as Cindy Lou can see that the Grinch 
is just a misunderstood person who simply wants to be loves, so can the 
viewers, which makes his turnaround in the finale all the more effective. How 
Carrey endured such a daunting makeup process is anyone's guess, but he sure 
does bring life to a character he was born to play.
The heroine of the film, young Cindy Lou-Who, who "was no more than two" in 
the book, has been transformed into a smart 7-year-old who only wishes that 
those around her would realize the true meaning of Christmas. As played by 
newcomer Taylor Momsen, she is a vivid and cute child who may be little, but 
is courageous and free-thinking. Momsen thankfully does not turn in an 
unctuous performance, or strains for cuteness, but is more unaffected and 
assured. The solo song she sings, "Christmas, Where Are You?," is gently 
beautiful, one of the best things about the first half because it isn't going 
for flashiness or bawdy humor.
The rest of the Whos, some supplied by strong performers such as Christine 
Baranski (as Martha May Whovier, who still holds a crush on the Grinch for 
her grade school days), Bill Irwin (Lou Lou-Who, Cindy's father), and Molly 
Shannon (Betty Lou-Who, Cindy's mother), come off as so shallow and 
underscripted that they make nearly no impression at all. The fact that they, 
too, all resemble mice people, is an ill-advised choice that the movie could 
have done without, and been better for it.
If the Whos don't keep up with the enchantment of the holiday itself, the 
lavish production design, by Michael Corinblith, does. While some sets are a 
little too artificial for their own good, Whoville is, nonetheless, a sight 
to behold. With an endless array of mountains surrounding the cozy town that 
remains blanketed in a thick cover of freshly-fallen snow, the movie is a 
dazzler for the eyes.
"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" lacks the life and joy required 
to make this movie a modern-day family classic, but it is mostly 
entertaining. The fact that the thin story had to be stretched out to 90 
minutes to begin with would be quite a daunting task, and director Ron Howard 
has given it his best shot--even if his best shot is not nearly the best the 
film could have been. Visionary filmmaker Tim Burton (1990's "Edward 
Scissorhands"), for example, would have been perfect to take the Dr. Seuss 
yarn on. His specialty in artistically mixing fantasy, sweetness, and the 
darker corners of the human condition might have made "The Grinch" a shade 
scarier, and not for the youngest of kiddies, but think about it. Aren't 
1939's "The Wizard of Oz" and 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" 
masterpieces because of the unpredictable wickedness that surrounded their 
stories and characters? "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas," while 
fine in its own right, could have certainly benefitted from a little more of 
that mischievous nature.

Jim Carrey is wonderful as the title character in "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas." Despite being trussed up in a cumbersome lycra spandex suit
covered with thousands of green-dyed yak hairs, elaborate facial makeup,
contact lenses and false teeth, Carrey moves about with great vigor, as
if he had inhabited the Grinch's body from birth. His expressions are
even more fluid Â it's amazing to see the actor project such a wide
range of emotion with rubber appliances glued all over his noggin. In
terms of style, the Grinch is a blustery, hyperactive drama queen and
Carrey absolutely nails him. The excess, the overindulgence that made so
many of Carrey's earlier performances cringe-worthy serves him perfectly
in this context. He is at his best when the Grinch is alone, stretching
out like some mutant hybrid of a mountain lion and Oscar Madison while
checking his schedule. "Let's see," he purrs malevolently, "4 o'clock:
Wallow in self-pity. 4:30: Stare into the abyss. 5 o'clock: Come up with
a solution to world hunger and don't tell anybody."
Although I found Jim Carrey's work delightful, I left the screening of
the high profile holiday offering less than satisfied, wondering why
Hollywood felt the need to take a nice, uncomplicated, 22-minute cartoon
and redo it as a live action extravaganza. Theodor S. Geisel (AKA Dr.
Seuss), who wrote the original story and collaborated on the TV version,
apparently shared my sentiments, turning away those eager to transform
his books into movies. As regards "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," he
was quite satisfied with the 1966 animated TV show and didn't think it
could be improved upon.
In the press kit for the feature, the producers trumpet the fact that
many filmmakers had sought permission to make Dr. Seuss movies and
"Geisel repeatedly turned down their requests. Until now." Gosh, I
wonder if the fact that Geisel died in 1991 might have been a factor in
his change of attitude?
Actually, Geisel's widow, Audrey, authorized the film and reportedly
used her veto power to ax a few scenes she found inappropriate. If only
she had monitored the screenplay (written by the men responsible for the
big-screen dud, "Wild Wild West") as closely, she would have seen where
the adaptation went wrong.
The 1966 cartoon told a simple story well. The denizens of Whoville were
gentle beings happily working together to prepare for Christmas. Up in
the mountains, the wicked Grinch, whose heart was "two sizes too small,"
glared down at the villagers and concocted a plan to quash their spirit.
On Christmas Eve, dressed as Santa Claus, he stole all their presents,
their decorations and even their food. The next morning, instead of
hearing cries of anguish, the Grinch listened as the folks in Whoville
sang together in joy, unaffected by their material losses. Finally
realizing the true meaning of Christmas, the Grinch tearfully returned
everything and joined the Whos in their festivities.
To expand the tale to feature length, the new writers opt to look at why
the Grinch became so mean. In doing so, they turn Whoville inside out.
The big-screen Whos race about town trying to balance loads of presents.
When little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) tries to ask her father, Lou
Lou (Bill Irwin), about what the holiday really stands for, he is too
busy shopping to answer her. Mother Betty Lou (Molly Shannon) is no help
either; she and neighbor Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski) snipe
at one another while battling to see who can decorate their house more
lavishly.
It gets worse. We learn that the Grinch grew up in Whoville, where he
was mocked for looking different and being poor. When Cindy tries to
reconcile the adult Grinch with the town, pompous city leader May Who
(Jeffrey Tambor) does his best to keep the Grinch an exile.
Changing the Whos from idyllic sprites into clones of us is a bad idea.
It taints the film, adding bitter where before there was only sweet.
This may sound like nit picking, but remember, we're talking about a
beloved Christmas classic. Would it really be so hard to keep the fable
pure?
The transition from animation to live action suffers in other areas as
well. While Whoville retains the fairyland appearance of the original,
it never seems like anything more than a big set covered with
unconvincing fake snow. Director Ron Howard's lighting and camerawork
only add to the claustrophobic, artificial feel. As for the Whos,
attempts to make them physically resemble cartoon characters succeed
only with a few actors (Clint Howard actually looks better than usual),
while most of the others come off like the alien-of the-week from any
latter day "Star Trek" series (poor Molly Shannon is virtually
unrecognizable beneath her facial appliances).
The bottom line? As much as I enjoyed Jim Carrey's performance, I'll
take "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" in its 22-minute animated form,
where the Whos remain innocent, the story remains uncluttered and
Whoville looks like a magical village instead of the set for an
expensive grade school play.
