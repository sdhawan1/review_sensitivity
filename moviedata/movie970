   When I was running a speakers' program for my high school
teaching job, I once invited a male ballet dancer from a local
theater.  As soon as the macho students heard of his
profession, they laughed--just like four young barflies in
Nicholas Hytner's new and highly entertaining movie, "Center
Stage."  The dancer, whose name was Mischa, walked on his
toes for several minutes about the raised platform in the
center of the auditorium amid continued titters.  He then
invited three of the class weight lifters to come up and do the
same.  Guess who got the last laugh?
   "Center Stage" takes us into this world of dance, not only
of ballet but also of salsa, modern, jazz, and aerobics.  This
is a thoroughly refreshing movie, most unlike director
Nicholas Hytner's celebrated "The Madness of George III," its
script closer to the second-rate writing of the same director's
"The Object of My Affection."  As we left the theater after a
critics' screening, one colleague stated that Hytner had
"prostituted himself," explaining that the story was banal and
predictable and that "I just can't become interested in a movie
if I don't get into the story."  His attitude is unfortunate.  No
doubt there are moviegoers who demand that their
entertainment be plot-driven, but some of the best films are
character-driven and, in this case, music-and-dance
propelled.  And my, what a splendid diversion is "Center
Stage," a Broadway musical splashed across the big screen
treating its guests to front row seats at a small fraction of the
cost of seeing a live performance at Lincoln Center!  The
characters are types rather than unique individuals: one has
ample talent but an attitude problem; another has bad feet
and the wrong body, but her heart is abundantly large; yet a
third girl is the best, talent-wise, but she is unhappily in the
wrong profession, one which makes her sad and even
desperate.  The principal male is the envy of the entire
company and is appropriately full of himself and a perilous
womanizer.  But who cares if they're stereotypes?  The
bodies on the stage are young, bouncy and attractive, their
spirits are alive in youth's best tradition; and when they dance
they make us feel as though we're at once in the world of
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and of Arthur
Laurents and Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story."
   "Center Stage" focusses on Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull),
whose name may be a homage to "42nd Street"'s Peggy
Sawyer--a blue-eyed blonde of flawless good looks who is
accepted into a class at the American Ballet Academy at New
York's Lincoln Center because of her face and despite her
"bad feet."  As she pirouettes across the grounds of this most
prestigious of American dance schools, she greets an
assortment of people, actually types: Maureen (Susan May
Pratt) is the academy's finest dancer, a bulimic profoundly
unhappy in a career chosen for her by her frustrated mother,
Nancy (Debra Monk).  Jonathan (Peter Gallagher) and
Juliette (Donna Murphy) are the school's director and chief
instructor respectively while Eva (Zoe Saldana) is the
chip-on-her-shoulder girl whose manner virtually challenges
the director to throw her out.  Though many young eyes are
on the attractive, Seattle-born Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), the
superstar is first- class dancer and choreographer Cooper
(Ethan Stiefel).
   The dance numbers (which are what we came for, not for
Carol Heikkinen's giddy story) are so varied that we don't get
to learn much about the nature of any one genre.  We do find
out from an opening visual on a performer's feet that the
ballet punishes far more than stiletto heels ever could,
causing sores and rashes and bunions that make us wonder
how dancers can last through even their brief ten-year
careers before they become teachers or burger flippers.  
   As Jodie wins the attention and infatuation of Cooper only
to lose heart when Cooper inevitably moves on to his next
conquest, and as Maureen learns through months of
regurgitation that this career is not for her, we get a sense
however spurious of the backstage lives of these young
people--their relationships with one another and with the older
folks who run the school.  What the movie is really about is
Ethan Stiefel's dancing to the George Balanchine-
choreographed Stars andStripes, the two gossamer lovers in
Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet, and especially the
bang-up concluding performance, an original rock creation
complete with motorcycle on stage, performed to the music of
Michael Jackson--which brings the SRO audience at the
American Ballet Theater to its feet.
   The story is no way up to the caliber of Mike Leigh's
"Topsy-Turvy," but the Broadway-style performances are
more vivid than the segments shown in that picture's excerpts
from "The Mikado."  What you come away with is that these
dancers can prance to salsa, aerobics, and jazz as readily as
they pirouette to the stately and soaringly romantic airs of
Tschaikowsky.  Ethan Stiefel is the man to watch, a principal
dancer with the American Ballet Theatre who is perhaps the
present generation's answer to Mikhail Barishnikov.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 2000

 At the American Ballet Academy, there is an abundance of passion,
talent and determination. Of course these things simply aren't enough
when it comes to making it as a professional ballet dancer.
 As the camera probes into a crowded room of ballerinas spinning and
dipping, a young blond is immediately isolated from the bunch. The male
choreographer's assistant notes that the girl has poor form. The
choreographer retorts, "Who cares, look at her." And with that the
blonde, blue-eyed Jodie is given a spot in the American Ballet Academy,
the Julliard of dancing.
 The visual entrance to the ABA is a series of close-ups on cut,
bruised, and bandaged feet; this is as nuanced as the film ever gets.
The pain and anguish of living out your dreams, of striving to beat out
the odds and become what you always dreamed of becoming (here it is a
dancer), is isolated in the trite experiences of three roommates at this
prestigious ballet school. Jodie is the one with "bad feet" but ample
heart; Eva is the talented one with a bad attitude; and Maureen is the
perfect one without the passion.
 Along the way misguided affairs (Jodie falls for the cocky, beloved
star of the Company), eating disorders and injuries crop up, pushing the
plot along. As do unfortunate lines like, 'I'm not dancing for them
anymore; I'm dancing for me.' The only solace from such schlock is the
fact that the film makes it clear from the start that it exists simply
to showcase the dancing itself. As such, it's no shock when the
choreography upstages the screenwriting.
 A Broadway musical in disguise, Center Stage parades around as a drama
by limiting the intricate dance numbers to rehearsals and performances.
No one breaks out dancing mid-speech -- they simply wait until they're
in the studio (which is more often than not).
The dancing itself is typified by the finale of the film, which takes
form in the modern "ballet" the students perform to the music of Michael
Jackson. The student performance, which of course appears before a
packed house in Lincoln Center, is intended to provide a hip twist on
the drab classicism of ballet (who knew one could pirouette to the King
of Pop as easily as to Tchaikovski).
Ultimately the story line here is as stupid as the final "rock" ballet.
The characters are one-dimensional, as are their "struggles." In fact,
the territory is so familiar that it's almost excusable. With that said
it's still hard to watch Center Stage and be able to get the familiar
opening music to Fame out of your head; it's also hard to remember why
you're not simply watching that film instead.

CENTER STAGE (director: Nicholas Hytner; screenwriter: Carol Heikkinen;

Schull (Jody), Zoe Saldana (Eva), Susan May Pratt (Maureen), Peter
Gallagher (Jonathan Reeves), Donna Murphy (Juliette Simone), Debra Monk

This is a backstage drama of talented young students trying to be
somebody, knowing that only a handful of them will achieve success in
their chosen field. They try out for the fictional American Ballet
Academy in NYC, hoping to be chosen for a coveted spot in their
prestigious workshop program. If successful, three females and three
males will be chosen for a dancing spot in the elite American Ballet
Company. The story is bogged down with cliches and cardboard characters,
while the ballet dancing is the thing of beauty in this film. Most of
the dancers are professionals of the highest standards and it shows by
their excellent performance. One of them, the film's star, Cooper (Ethan
Stiefel), is recognized by most in the field as the best in the world.
The framework of the story is the same formula seen in almost every
Hollywood sports film, as the art of dancing is only paid lip service
to. In fact, if this film wasn't about ballet dancers, it could have
been about chorus dancers or football players, and the same trite tale
could have been woven. Which shows you how much art mattered. The best
reason for seeing the film, is that the dancing is alive and pulsating,
choreographed by the likes of Balanchine, Susan Stroman and Christopher
Wheeldon, as well as Ivanov and MacMillan. But if you want to see a
quality ballet film with a real love story and with the pangs of what
goes through an artist, then your best bet is "The Red Shoes (48)."
The story follows a group of these young ballet students, emphasizing
their aspirations, their emotional problems, and their athletic stamina
to take the rigors of their difficult work. The film is hip to ballet
dancers, letting us in on the secret that many of the male dancers are
gay, and a straight dancers is much welcomed by the ladies. Many smoke a
lot in the hopes of killing their appetites, as weight is something they
are all concerned about. And, that they can be easily devasted by
criticism of their performance. They also gossip, as well as compete
hard, and are jealous of another's success.
All the film characters are made of stock types: the tough teacher who
really cares; the unsophisticate who experiences rejection in love and
harsh criticism from her teacher, but overcomes these embarrassments;
the overeater who gets bounced from the academy; the surly rebel who
learns that it is sometimes necessary to conform; and, the bulimic with
the pushy mother who confronts her at last. It is was too much effort
following all their predictable stories, especially when you know
everything is going to be tied up in a nice pink ribbon by the end.
The main story is about Jody (Amanda) and her disappointments and
eventual accomplishments, whose parents would rather that she be a
freshman in college than dancing in NYC and can't share the joy she has
in being accepted to the ABA. Cooper is the star of the company, whose
ballerina girlfriend Kathleen married Jonathan (Peter Gallagher), the
company's head. On the rebound, he picks up the pretty but insecure Jody
and takes advantage of her by taking her to bed and then fluffing her
off, but he also gives her a big break and puts her into the new radical
ballet he is creating as the guest choreographer for the students'
illustrious final exam, a workshop performance before a live audience
and a chance for the students to be recognized by all the major
professional ballet troupes.
The minor stories were about Sergei (Ilia Kulik-real-life Russian figure
skater), a Russian dancer separated by distance from his ballerina
girlfriend who out of loneliness picks up a girl in a disco spot by
saying he is in the Russian Mafia, because when he tells other girls he
meets there that he's in the ballet, they laugh at him. Sascha Radetsky
is Charlie, the engaging student dancer from the west, who is the nice
boy Jody becomes involved with. Zoe Saldana is Eva Rodriguez, a black
Hispanic with an attitude problem, who is a great dancer but must learn
obedience. She sasses her teacher (Donna Murphy), comes late to class,
chews gum in class, but loves to dance. And then there is Maureen
(Pratt), who has been pushed into dance by her overbearing mother, and
is considered by the company to have the best technique but no heart in
her dancing. She reluctantly meets a college student studying medicine
and goes against her mother's wishes by dating him.
This film reminded me a lot of Hollywood's ode to lowbrow culture "Band
Wagon," which was much more entertaining.
In Center Stage, there was plenty of dancing at rehearsals and in the
two big ballet numbers they put on, before the film comes to its
predictable climax for its soap opera stories. The aim of the film was
to be entertaining, the art part it dumbed down for mass consumption,
though its story could have been worst than it actually was, as it was
kept in check from completely taking over the film. What it comes down
to, is that the story didn't completely take away from the dance,
therefore the film had some mild entertainment value and some sparkle
could be detected in the eyes of the students when they were dancing.

2000 has been a fairly dreadful year, thus far, in movies. Week after week, 
new releases are presented to the country, and week after week, it seems, the 
pictures aren't worth the celluloid they were made on. Sooner or later, a 
film was going to finally be released that would really get me excited, that 
would cause me to sit up straight and take notice. It wasn't a matter of 
"if," but "when." Unexpectedly, "Center Stage," by acclaimed director 
Nicholas Hytner (1996's "The Crucible"), is an often remarkably exhilarating 
and surprisingly insightful dance drama, perhaps the most impressionable and 
well-made in its genre since 1987's "Dirty Dancing." 
Wisely, in casting the movie, Hytner opted to give the majority of roles to 
real-life dancers, so as to be more free and alive in the choreography, not 
having to use camera tricks and quick jump-cuts when an actor's stand-in is 
brought into the sequence. This filmmaking decision pays off splendidly 
because, although it was initially risky casting novice actors/pro dancers in 
the major roles, Hytner has gotten fine performances out of each of them, 
along with their stunning expertise in understanding and flowing with the 
music.
"Center Stage" begins with a select group of young dancers being chosen to 
move to New York City to practice at the prestigious American Ballet Academy, 
where only three men and three women will eventually be picked at the close 
of the year to become members of the American Ballet Company. Jody Sawyer 
(Amanda Schull) is a wide-eyed 17-year-old who decides to put college on hold 
in order to go to the ABA, and follow through with the dream she has had 
since she was a child. Once there, Jody becomes close friends with roommate 
Eva (Zoe Saldana), also freshly chosen for the Academy, who has what it takes 
to be a professional dancer, but has an overly direct attitude problem that 
defers her chance of working her way onto the good sides of her instructors. 
Their third, and final, roommate is Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a highly 
talented ballerina who has been at the Academy since age 9, but who doesn't 
even want to be a dancer, instead trying to fulfill her mother's (Debra Monk) 
wishes and dreams.
Of the three, it is Jody who has the most willingness to practice and be the 
best that she can be, but is told right off the bat by one of her hard-edged 
instructors (Donna Murphy) that her feet and body type are all wrong. Once 
there, Jody is smitten by Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), a young instructor and 
nearly perfect dancer who leads her into believing he likes her, even though 
he only wants to use her. More earnest and caring to Jody's feelings and 
future is Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), a fellow dancer who, nonetheless, is 
rebuffed when Jody mistakenly believes it could work out between Cooper and 
herself. Meanwhile, Eva befriends gay dancer Erik (Shakiem Evans), while 
Maureen begins to realize how much more satisfying life could be for her 
without having dancing on her shoulders, when she starts a relationship with 
a handsome, sweet-natured waiter (Eion Bailey).
"Center Stage" is an exceptional film in more ways than one. Most notably, 
the dance sequences, which include ballet, rock dance, and salsa, are 
showstopping, alive with astonishing energy and genuine excitement, 
adjectives rarely able to be put to rightful use in present-day film reviews. 
Since most of the players have dance experience, they clearly understand the 
power that this art form has the ability to project, and all of them deliver 
a sense of joy of dancing. Some of the more unconventional setpieces are the 
highlights, including one played to the hard-edged, rocking beat of the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers' "Higher Ground," and a climactic scene between Schull, 
Stiefel, and Radetsky that is brilliantly choreographed and veritably 
effective, as it closely mirrors their relationships in real life.
Amid the dancing is, indeed, several stories that are played out, and what is 
so surprising is how well-handled each of the characters are. Jody, the 
film's main protagonist, comes-of-age in the course of the picture, not 
exactly by making the transition from child to young woman, but by learning 
what is most important, and wising up to the frequently harsh ways of the 
world. When she dances in the finale, we are indubitably able to see what 
kind of a determined, intelligent person Jody has blossomed into in the last 
year. Amanda Schull, in her film debut, is not only a beautiful face, but 
also a natural actress, and the type of likable person that one enjoys 
following throughout the film.
As Eva, Zoe Saldana is a standout. Brought up in Boston, Eva adores ballet, 
but her attitude and unwillingness to follow by a strict set of rules puts 
her at a clear disadvantage with the other dancers she is, in essence, 
learning with and competing against. 
Out of all of the main younger people in the film, only Susan May Pratt is an 
actress, rather than a dancer. Previously seen in 1999's "10 Things I Hate 
About You" and "Drive Me Crazy," Pratt is given her meatiest role to date. As 
Maureen, a girl just beginning to learn why it is that she has been so 
unhappy in her life, Pratt equips herself quite nicely, and is given one 
truthful scene between she and her boyfriend, played well by Eion Bailey, 
that is touching in an honest way, rather than one that is purposefully 
attempting to be melodramatic.
As far as the girls' male counterparts go, Ethan Stiefel, as the unreliable 
Cooper, and, especially, Sascha Radetsky, as the winning Charlie, are 
outstanding in both their respective roles, which are refreshingly not 
paint-by-numbers, as well as on the dance floor. Peter Gallagher, as a 
sympathetic dance instructor, as well as Donna Murphy and Debra Monk, as 
Maureen's overbearing mother, appear in supporting adult roles.
Despite the seriousness and candid view of much of its subject matter 
(including eating disorders, the literal pain that goes into ballet 
practicing, and the cutthroat atmosphere of dance academies), where "Center 
Stage" ultimately sparkles is in its pure entertainment value. Although not 
one to usually "cut a rug," the film opened up my limited interest in dance 
and, dare I say it, had the power of making me attracted to the act of doing 
it. Perceptively written by Carol Heikkenen and vibrantly directed by Hytner, 
"Center Stage" is the most energetic film so far this year, and one that has 
every right to be placed alongside "Fame," "All That Jazz," and "Flashdance," 
in the annals of dance film classics.

 Think "Fame" meets "The Turning Point" or "The Red Shoes" and
you have the concept of this backstage story set at Lincoln Center's
prestigious and, at times, pretentious American Ballet
Theater. Directed by Nicholas Hytner ("The Madness of King George,"
"The Crucible"), it's filled with enthusiasm and good intentions,
offering a glimpse into the demanding world of ballet, complete with
bruises and bandages.  Amanda Schull stars as a beautiful, blue-eyed
blond with "bad feet" who temporarily pirouettes into the affections
of Ethan Stiefel, a principal dancer with the ABT who could be the
next Mikhail Barishnikov. They're surrounded by stereotypical "A
Chorus Line"-types - the bulimic prodigy (Susan May Pratt) with a
pushy mother (Debra Monk), the edgy rebel (Zoe Saldana) with a bad
attitude, the best-friend (Shakiem Evans), the romantic (Sascha
Radetsky), the Russian (ice-skating champion Ilia Kulik) and faculty
members (Peter Gallagher, Donna Murphy). It's all very familiar: there
are six spots in the company to be filled - who will get them? And the
screenplay by Carol Heikkinen ("The Thing Called Love," "Empire
Records") is corny, filled to the brim with cliches. It's hard not to
chuckle at: "I'm not dancing for them anymore - I'm dancing for me."
Make no mistake: this no "Dirty Dancing" or "Flashdance." Yet there's
aerobic jazz and salsa, as well as the classic tradition of
Tchiakovsky and Prokofiev. To me, the highlights were Stiefel's
performing "Stars and Stripes," choreographed by George Balanchine,
and the hip finale, set to the rock music of Michael
Jackson. Basically, this is TV fare that will probably be far more
satisfying on video. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Center
Stage" is a graceful 4. But it's the dancing that scores, not the
drama.

DIRTY BALLET DANCING, released under the pseudonym of CENTER STAGE,
tries to make the hard and competitive world of ballet dancing as much
fun as rock and roll. Not since Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze cut a
rug in the Catskills has a movie so wanted to demonstrate the sensuous
joy of moving one's body to a beat. Although CENTER STAGE doesn't really
find its groove until the last act, its dance numbers are well worth the
price of admission. Just try to forgive the amount of celluloid director
Nicholas Hytner (THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION and THE CRUCIBLE) wastes on
the story's hackneyed romances.
Screenwriter Carol Heikkinen subscribes to the "one of" theory of script
design, so the dozens of dancers include: one gay, one bulimic, one not
skinny, one loud mouth, one black male and one Hispanic female. The rest
are so interchangeable that you'll wish that they had numbers on them to
make it easier to tell them apart. And since the writer doesn't want to
make a choice, she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories, all at the
expense of the dance sequences, which is the only reason to see the
movie in the first place.
The story starts off promisingly as it shows how hard it is to get into
the best ballet school and how much harder still to make it into "the
company." One of the film's most instructive and fascinating segments
has the ballet dancers using everything from fire to water in order to
get their toe shoes into just the right shape. And once their practice
sessions begin, their feet turn into bloody imitations of the moonscape.
The dancers endure incredible pain for the slim chance that they'll hit
the big time, and the chorus -- in which you can tell your friends that
you're the third one from the left -- is the most that even the better
students can realistically hope for.
After this ambitious start, the picture quickly bogs down into petty
competition and light-weight love stories. One of the hardest parts of
the story to believe is the excessive politeness with which dance
instructors like Juliette (Donna Murphy) treat the students. Speaking
almost in whispers, the instructors give their generally mild critiques.
Light-years away from the drill instructor style that one would expect,
they are so quiet that it's a miracle that the dancers can hear them.
But the story's limitations become mere quibbles when the dancing
starts. The best of the dancers, Ethan Stiefel as Cooper Nielsen, amazes
us with his high flying, twirling bravado. When he engages another in a
dazzling dancing duel, there's never any question as to who will emerge
as the winner. Although not his equal in technical skill, Amanda Schull
as Jody Sawyer, plays the dancer with the most heart. When they perform
the long ending sequence together, the movie sizzles, and the
choreography wows us with its inviting originality. See it first on the
big screen, and later, when it goes to video, hit the fast-forward
button every time the dancing stops.
CENTER STAGE runs 1:53. It is rated PG-13 for language and some
sensuality and would be fine for kids around 11 or 12 and up.

Directed by Nicholas Hytner. Screenplay by Carol Heikkinen. Starring
Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt. Running time: 116 minutes.
Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 21st, 2000.
There is an undeniable formula to movies like "Center Stage". In their 
home towns, the protagonists -- usually young, athletic and attractive -- 
have enjoyed success in their field of choice (here, ballet). Then they 
are thrust into the limelight, and find things more difficult than they 
ever expected. Their struggles to overcome this adversity all lead up to 
a single pivotal event which will either make or break their futures.
There's no getting away from this recipe; audiences seem to enjoy it, and 
it's pretty easy to write. Hence it is rare to find a film in this genre 
which actually tries to do something different. "Center Stage" is not 
that film, and so the question becomes not whether it is creatively 
noteworthy, but whether it makes good use of familiar material. 
Fortunately, the answer is yes: "Center Stage" is by no means a milestone 
in movie history, but it is very enjoyable and even exceptional in 
certain respects.
More than anything else, what helps "Center Stage" to rise above the pack 
is that it exudes a feeling of authenticity. Director Nicholas Hytner has 
made the inspired decision to cast actual dancers in several of the lead 
roles. Not only are these actors really performing, then, but they've 
also endured many of the same ordeals that their characters encounter -- 
everything from blistered feet to demanding instructors. Often when these 
sorts of experiments are attempted in movies, they fail because the
neophyte actors don't actually know how to act. "Center Stage" does not 
fall into the same trap, and while none of the castmembers exactly shine, 
for the most part they don't fall flat, either.
That said, likely the best performance amongst the large cast of 
characters comes from one of the actors who isn't a dancer by trade, 
Susan May Pratt as Maureen. Pratt enjoys what is probably the most 
complicated role in the film, as the star pupil of the American Ballet 
Academy who also happens to be its biggest snob. But Maureen's demeanour 
is as much a result of her domineering mother, and she yearns for a 
normal life outside ballet. Again, these are all timeworn character 
staples, but Pratt does a good job with Maureen, and wisely avoids 
Veronica Lodge-like exaggeration. Her development over the course of the 
movie is involving and believable, especially once she acquires a 
boyfriend and finds out how "normal" kids her age live.
Maureen's roommates include Jody (Amanda Schull), who has a lot of 
potential but can never seem to do things right; and the hot-headed Eva 
(Zoe Saldana). It is around Jody that "Center Stage" really revolves -- 
her dispiriting tribulations at the ABA, her attempts to recapture her 
love of ballet, and her romantic entanglements with ABA star Cooper 
(Ethan Stiefel) and the nebbish Charlie (Sascha Radetsky, sadly rather 
wooden and vapid throughout). Her story is the most routine, and while 
Schull herself is pleasant to watch, her character's misfortunes become 
grating after a while. The extent to which she blunders at the ABA is 
stretched to the point of disbelief, and at times the movie risks making 
her seem not just overwhelmed but downright incompetent.
Eva, a somewhat more interesting if no less stereotyped character, is 
unfortunately shunted to the background for large chunks of the movie. 
Indeed, there are so many subplots running through "Center Stage" that it 
is a credit to screenwriter Carol Heikkinen that the picture rarely feels 
cluttered. And while some stories are emphasised to the detriment of 
others, Heikkinen at least ensures that all of them achieve a modicum of 
development and completion.
The action of the movie follows the students through a year at the ABA. 
To the surprise of absolutely nobody, it all comes together at a major 
end-of-term concert which serves as an audition piece for ballet 
companies, particularly the prestigious American Ballet Company which 
Jonathan runs. Only three boys and three girls can be accepted into the 
Company, and the identities of the lucky winners will probably not come 
as much of a surprise.
Fortunately, despite the relative lack of suspense, this closing 
performance is altogether enthralling. The music, the choreography, the 
production design, and the skill of the dancers all contribute to a 
dazzling sequence which provides the perfect climax for the film. It also 
marks a splendid showcase of both classic and modern ballet, and is the 
best of several such performances littered throughout the movie. Only a 
rather bizarre editing decision midway through mars this scene, throwing 
the audience briefly out of the reality of the performance.
Nonetheless, the scene echoes the best of the Hollywood musicals of the 
1940s and 1950s, and the work of actor/dancers like Gene Kelly, Fred 
Astaire and Ginger Rogers. After viewing "Center Stage", it is hard not 
to mourn the death of the movie musical. This is not to say that, as a 
film, it is up to the standards of "An American In Paris" or "West Side 
Story". But "Center Stage" does make a valiant effort, and more than once 
it succeeds delightfully.

         There's a segment of the moviegoing public some theater
managers refer to as the Ohmigods. They're young women between the ages
of 11 and 15 -- that pre-dating period -- who flock to the cineplexes
every Friday night or Saturday afternoon to see the latest Freddie
Prinze Jr. or Joshua Jackson film and to discuss their peers. Their
comments often sound something like this: "Ohmigod, she is getting so
fat!"; "Ohmigod, he looks just like Josh Hartnett!"; "Ohmigod, 'Oops, I
Did It Again' is, like, the best song ever!"
 The Ohmigods will love "Center Stage," which was clearly
designed with them in mind. It has lots of graceful and sometimes
teasingly erotic dancing, a variety of attractive youthful stars, and a
plot that can be easily followed, even if you spend long stretches of
the movie talking to your best friend about how hot Brandon looked in
geometry class or how Trina totally embarrassed herself at the party
last week.
 Screenwriter Carol Heikkinen apparently spent more time
studying "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933" than she did
researching what aspiring ballet dancers actually go through in their
struggle to get into the spotlight. So "Center Stage" shamelessly hauls
out every trick in the dusty old musical comedy book, from the scolding
stage mother who pushes her daughter onto the boards to the chorus girl
who miraculously gets to play the lead when the star drops out at the
last minute.
 Stop me if you've heard this one before: Bright-eyed Jody
Sawyer (Amanda Schull) lands a slot at the American Ballet Academy,
alongside "everyone who matters in American ballet." Heck, one of her
fellow students even gave up the promise of a job at Hooters to go to
ABA, so you know it must be something special.
 Jody's classmates include Eva (Zoe Saldana), the requisite
smart-mouth who violates the dress code and hides her bruised heart;
Maureen (Susan May Pratt), who's hailed by everyone as the Next Big
Thing; Sergei (Ilia Kulik), the Russian who loves to party; and Charlie
(Sascha Radetsky), the nice guy from Seattle who's too shy to tell Jody
he's in love with her. So Jody eventually drifts into the arms of vain
Cooper Nielsen (Ethan Stiefel), who changes partners as often as he
changes leotards.
 Does Jody have enormous difficulty fitting in? Does one kid
turn out to be bulimic? Does a character tell another, "whatever you
feel, just dance it"? Does someone proclaim, "I'm not dancing for them
anymore -- I'm dancing for myself"?
 You need not see "Center Stage" to correctly guess the answers
to those questions.
  Most of the cast run into problems convincingly reading their
dialogue, but that's not much of a drawback since director Nicholas
Hytner routinely stops the story for lengthy, smoothly executed dance
sequences that will make any aspiring ballerinas in the audience want to
take some extra lessons.
 While it's hardly revolutionary, Susan Stroman's choreography
is the driving force behind the film, and the main reason to sit through
it. Every time the movie threatens to put us to sleep, Stroman throws in
a revitalizing scene, such as the Broadway dance class workout
underscored by Mandy Moore's bubblegum-pop treasure "Candy" and the Red
Hot Chili Peppers' pulse-pounding "Higher Ground."
 "Center Stage" wraps up with a supremely weird rock
ballet/pantomime that sets the story of "The Red Shoes" first to the
dreary music of Michael Jackson, then to the dynamic sounds of
Jamiroquoi. It's supposed to be part of a big stage show, although the
spectacle includes so many sets and split-second costume changes it
could only happen in the movies. The number somehow manages to get a
standing ovation from an audience of tough critics. "Center Stage"
itself isn't likely to get quite the same response. James Sanford

_Center_Stage_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
The young cast of unknowns in  _Center_Stage_ can all dance, which is a
very good thing indeed because virtually none of them can act.  And that,
of course, is a very, very bad thing when action shifts from the dance
studios of the American Ballet Academy to the outside lives of a
cross-section of students there.  Of course, those followed make a
diverse group: there's naive good girl Jody (Jennie Garth lookalike
Amanda Schull), who rooms with the talented smartass Eva (Zoë Saldana)
and Maureen (Susan May Pratt), the school's reigning diva; on the male
side are All-American good guy Charlie (Sascha Redetsky), Russian good
guy Sergei (Olympic figure skating champion Ilia Kulik), and bad boy
Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), the American Ballet Company's hot young star.
These characters all intersect and collide in predictable ways as they
deal with predictable personal issues.  Jody is quietly pursued by
Charlie, but she's drawn to Cooper.   Maureen slowly crumbles under the
pressure of her overbearing mother (Debra Monk) as a premed student (Eion
Bailey) aggressively woos her.  Eva butts heads with a strict teacher
(Donna Murphy) and the pompous head (Peter Gallagher) of the Academy over
her attitude.  And so on.
It may not sound so bad as described, but that's because I'm recounting
the film without any taste of screenwriter Carol Heikennen's dreary
dialogue, Nicholas Hytner's overly earnest direction, or the truly putrid
performances by these unpromising acting "talents."  (Something is
clearly amiss when the one character's development of bulimia is met with
laughter from the audience.)  The one exception is the spunky Saldana,
who is the only one to make her character appear to be a real person, let
alone one the audience comes to care about.  Whenever she's not onscreen
or no one is dancing (with the exception of the climactic ballet, which
is supposed to be "hip" and "revolutionary" but is actually quite
ridiculous), _Center_Stage_ is one trying watch.

--A copy of this review can be found at
http://moviereviews.org/center_stage.htm ---
Most films that idealize, glorify or emphasize a profession have the
potential to be successful with an audience regardless of whether or not the
crowd is part of that profession. Example: it is rather easy to enjoy films
like `Any Given Sunday,' `For Love of the Game' and `The Color of Money'
despite the fact that the average viewer has never played professional
football, pitched a no-hitter or even ran a pool table. The same could be
applied to films with a more artistic core  `Bullets Over Broadway,'
`Bowfinger' and `This is Spinal Tap' all strike a cord with audiences even
though those audiences have, most likely, never written a play, directed an
independent film or been part of a heavy metal rock group. So it is that we
arrive at `Center Stage,' a film that although oftentimes sexy and dazzling
seems to disprove the above theory. The movie does everything in its power
to be a quality piece, the actors are stellar and the plot is decent enough
to pass in this era of poorly and hastily scrapped together scripts. Yet the
majority of the film's hardcore dance scenes  of which there are many  are
frighteningly unentertaining. The reason: it seems ballet might just be too
isolated an activity for outsiders to understand or be enthusiastic about.
Ironically, it is that very incestuous nature of the art that `Center Stage'
so beautifully depicts. During the course of the two-hour film, there is but
a single outsider who has a prominent role  predictably enough, he faces
rejection en route to ultimate acceptance. All the other figures in the film
are ballet students, instructors or administrators. There is no central
character but rather a handful of equally prominent people that rotate turns
being the center of attention (or, should I say, taking center stage?). All
part of the American Ballet Academy, a very select program at Lincoln
Center, they include Jody (the beautiful and talented Amanda Schull), a
young student striving to make it as a dancer; Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), a
master of the art who literally fled personal problems and must now return
to face them; Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a slightly more experienced pupil
than Jody, who will, during the course of the film, learn that there is more
to life than ballet and how much she hates her mother for forcing her into
being a ballerina (there's a new one!) and Eva (Zoe Saldana), a young girl
seeking direction who will only dance to the point at which she is happy and
doesn't much care if that her gets her anywhere or not (notice, she is the
only person in this film other than the aforementioned outsider who seems to
almost have her priorities in order).
Such misplaced priorities lead to the encouragement of near-anorexia, a
nonchalant attitude by most towards a bulimic character and quotes such as
`I don't want to go to college, I want to dance' being ultimately rewarded.
Furthermore, a sexual encounter that seems mighty improper doesn't quite
receive the wrath it deserves.
Interestingly, though, such sexual side plots could have served to better
the film if further explored. Had the filmmakers been willing to drop the
PG-13 rating and such silly tactics as the infamous `L' shaped covers used
by a couple the morning after an impromptu sexual encounter, the movie might
have taken on an angle that audiences could appreciate in lieu of trying to
decode the innermost workings of a ballet class filled with trade lingo that
might as well be gibberish.
Still, sexual appeal most certainly is not absent from the film. The group
of no-name actors and actresses are all extraordinarily attractive and
talented people that teenybopper crowds will likely take an interest in. No,
there probably is no Leo here, although Amanda Schull certainly could become
a female equivalent, but it is no mistake that the establishing shot of the
film is the number 15  the picture's target age group.
As the movie draws to a close, the incomprehensible ballet that the audience
has endured actually comes together for a rather enjoyable payoff scene 
after all, anyone can enjoy a ballet recital. Memories of the classic
musical `Fame' will likely come to mind and comparisons are bound to be
drawn. But don't kid yourself, `Center Stage' isn't going to live forever.

If you like campy dance movies, this one won't let you down. One "free"
screener commented, "If I paid money for it, I wouldn't have been
disappointed." This reviewer, expecting a wince-able display, admittedly
winced only a couple of times. Another viewer/dance major said something
like this, "Great dancing ... err ah, ... dancers aren't good actors
though."
"Center Stage" is what you'd expect it to be - even a little more. Though it
has its fair share of stale acting, more than half of the principals do pull
their own weight. In fact, Susan May Pratt (Maureen) taps down a strong
performance as the prissy perfect ballerina soon to learn a lesson on self.
A scene with her domineering mom in the middle of the film is perfectly
written, directed and acted.
We follow a group of choice young ballet talent through soap, friendships,
and a year of strict dance training at ABC (only the world's premiere
studio). Which three will make it into the professional dance company? Campy
and fun, un-glamorized dance sequences, light, well-paced.

DIRTY BALLET DANCING, released under the pseudonym of CENTER STAGE,
tries to make the hard and competitive world of ballet dancing as much
fun as rock and roll. Not since Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze cut a
rug in the Catskills has a movie so wanted to demonstrate the sensuous
joy of moving one's body to a beat. Although CENTER STAGE doesn't really
find its groove until the last act, its dance numbers are well worth the
price of admission. Just try to forgive the amount of celluloid director
Nicholas Hytner (THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION and THE CRUCIBLE) wastes on
the story's hackneyed romances.
Screenwriter Carol Heikkinen subscribes to the "one of" theory of script
design, so the dozens of dancers include: one gay, one bulimic, one not
skinny, one loud mouth, one black male and one Hispanic female. The rest
are so interchangeable that you'll wish that they had numbers on them to
make it easier to tell them apart. And since the writer doesn't want to
make a choice, she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories, all at the
expense of the dance sequences, which is the only reason to see the
movie in the first place.
The story starts off promisingly as it shows how hard it is to get into
the best ballet school and how much harder still to make it into "the
company." One of the film's most instructive and fascinating segments
has the ballet dancers using everything from fire to water in order to
get their toe shoes into just the right shape. And once their practice
sessions begin, their feet turn into bloody imitations of the moonscape.
The dancers endure incredible pain for the slim chance that they'll hit
the big time, and the chorus -- in which you can tell your friends that
you're the third one from the left -- is the most that even the better
students can realistically hope for.
After this ambitious start, the picture quickly bogs down into petty
competition and light-weight love stories. One of the hardest parts of
the story to believe is the excessive politeness with which dance
instructors like Juliette (Donna Murphy) treat the students. Speaking
almost in whispers, the instructors give their generally mild critiques.
Light-years away from the drill instructor style that one would expect,
they are so quiet that it's a miracle that the dancers can hear them.
But the story's limitations become mere quibbles when the dancing
starts. The best of the dancers, Ethan Stiefel as Cooper Nielsen, amazes
us with his high flying, twirling bravado. When he engages another in a
dazzling dancing duel, there's never any question as to who will emerge
as the winner. Although not his equal in technical skill, Amanda Schull
as Jody Sawyer, plays the dancer with the most heart. When they perform
the long ending sequence together, the movie sizzles, and the
choreography wows us with its inviting originality. See it first on the
big screen, and later, when it goes to video, hit the fast-forward
button every time the dancing stops.
CENTER STAGE runs 1:53. It is rated PG-13 for language and some
sensuality and would be fine for kids around 11 or 12 and up.

Okay, okay...so I was dragged kicking and screaming to this film by none
other than the dance-freak herself, Mrs. JoBlo. I suppose that it serves me
right for having her sit through GOODFELLAS every other two weeks. But I
always like to be honest in my reviews, so it's only fair that you know that
I don't like ballet, don't like opera or theatre, and certainly don't like
to dance (although I don't mind a little slam-dance every now and then). All
this to say that despite my obvious distaste for most of this film's themes,
I actually enjoyed this frothy little pic.
PLOT:
A bunch of dedicated ballet-dancing teenagers must vie for a handful of
openings at the prestigious American Ballet Company. Competition, jealousy,
hard work and love all find their way into the story.
CRITIQUE:
Despite its unoriginal theme, this film actually managed to keep me somewhat
entertained with its light drama, light humor and inspirational message for
the kids. In fact, one of the main things that I liked about this movie was
how it was so different than all of the other "cooler" teen flicks which
pack our multiplexes every other weekend. These teenagers actually seemed to
have ambitions, goals, passions for a career, as opposed to the sorry sack
of sex-starved teens which usually line these films. Mind you, there's
definitely a place for those boogers as well, in fact, I enjoy a good time
as much as the next guy, but it was still nice to see some kids actually
trying to make something of themselves. Refreshing, really. The film also
featured many great dancing moments, as you would expect, and despite it
being ballet-dancing, which I admit to despising personally, I still managed
to remain quite interested, if only because of the superior technique
utilized so masterfully by these boys and girls. But when you consider that
this film is aimed primarily at teenage girls, it doesn't really make sense
to read reviews of the movie coming from 50-year old men, who will more than
likely, not appreciate the film on the same level as its intended audience.
I personally thought that the film was okay overall (and I still haven't hit
the big 30, people!), despite a couple of so-so actors, and a few lines
which were just horribly trite, I did appreciate the film's integral message
of persistence, hard work and truth to oneself. Many older generation folks
have probably seen this theme developed better in a handful of other films,
including FAME, the obvious comparison point. But on its own, this film
moves along at a quick pace, offers an endearing performance from its star,
Amanda Schull, and ultimately managed to keep an ol' foggie like me involved
for most of its run-time, so all in all, not too shabby. Of course, I could
have done without the obvious attempt at "connecting" with the younger
audience, with the final ballet show featuring a corny "modern-ballet"
motif, but then again, I'm not exactly a teenage girl (anymore, that is :),
so who knows how that will play to its target audience.
So see this movie if you like ballet, need some teenage inspiration, or
honestly just like to see boys and girls skip around in tights, or skip the
movie altogether, if you're looking for something revolutionary or truly
insightful.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Casting this film was one of the director's most difficult tasks. Not only
did the players have to be able to perform classical ballet, modern jazz,
Broadway dancing and salsa, but obviously, they also needed to know how to
act!
The role of Cooper Nielson was given to 26-year old American Ballet Theatre
superstar Ethan Stiefel, who already has a reputation as one of the greatest
male dancers in the world today. The filmmakers also incorporated some parts
of Ethan's own life into the movie, like the fact that he rides a
Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
The lead role of Jody was much more difficult to cast. In fact, the director
traveled to several cities all over the country, in order to find a dancer
to play the part. He auditioned hundreds of young girls, but finally decided
on Amanda Schull, who had just been accepted as an apprentice with the San
Francisco Ballet. She celebrated her 21st birthday during the production of
the film.
Sascha Radetsky, a dancer in the corps de ballet of American Ballet theatre,
originally read for the role of Sergei, the Russian boy, but ultimately got
the role of Charlie, the boy who falls in love with Jody.
The role of Sergei, the young Russian ballet student, was eventually cast
with Ilia Kulik, a young Russian ice skater who took home a gold medal in
the 1998 Olympics, and who makes his acting debut in this film.
Two "actors" who were actually cast in this film include Susan May Pratt,
most recently of 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, who plays the part of Maureen,
and Eion Bailey, from FIGHT CLUB, who plays her boyfriend Jim in the movie.
This film was originally titled CITY BALLET and THE DANCE MOVIE.
