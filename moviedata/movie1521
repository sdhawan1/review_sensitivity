What is a Jackie Chan trademark? Attempting all his own stunts and
breaking all his bones is probably one. An extremely high premium rate
on his life insurance policy is probably another. How about the Mickey
Mouse comicness of his over exagerated expressions - probably a third? I
find this annoying and some critics will disagree with me. Some people
actually like this sort of kiddy mix of kick-butt-attitude action and it
probably served Chan well in his twenties and thirties, but there comes
a time in life, when it just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. When
you're past forty, showing you're naked butt, no matter how well toned,
just doesn't live up to what it was a decade ago. I'm referring to the
arse uncovered, dog sniffing, girl gawking scene which goes a little
past embarrassing. Please, Jackie not again.
As is expected of most of Chan's movie, this is fast moving. Let's face
it this little' 5'9' chap just can't keep still. He is undoubtedly the
most agile, acrobatic, hyperactive Hollywood star and proves it by
dancing elegantly to cat and mouse throughout this movie. So to the plot
- it all seems a vague blur, but has a something to do with Russian
Mafia, the CIA and Jackie. Who cares about the plot anyway, they're
always vaguely similar and most people paid to see the action anyway. Of
note is a particularly back breaking ladder scene, which Chan uncannily
uses as an extension of his body, creating the feel of two become one.
Artistic and well choreographed. Now I'd like to see him do these same
stunts on ice - which would be spectacular or a spectacle.
The acting .. hmmm . I'll just skip that discourse and mosey along to
say that this is number four in the long line of POLICE STORY sequels. I
missed the first three and somehow, I have the strangest feeling I
haven't missed much. There will be the die hard Chan fan's who will
disagree with me even as this never-ending saga of Chan sequel's
continue. So I didn't like the movie overall, but Chan will live to
fight another day.

     JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE (also called POLICE STORY 4: FIRST
STRIKE) is the Hong Kong action star's latest film.  Unlike his past
low budget films, this one has a highly polished look and appears to
have a cost quite a bit more.  For you many Jackie Chan fans, do not
worry, his latest picture is as much fun as the others.  On the other
hand, if you hated him before, this film is unlikely to change your
mind.  The acting by the supporting cast is pathetic, but, hey, you've
got Jackie.  With his everyman demeanor, his innocent smile, and his
vulnerability, he easily wins over the hearts of most audiences.
     The plot, such as it is, concerns a stolen Ukrainian nuclear
warhead.  The action happens all over the world from the Ukraine to
Australia.  The plot is a mess.  Do not waste your time trying to make
any sense out of it.  Just sink back into your theater seat and wait
for Jackie's next great stunt, remembering that Jackie does all his own
stunts.  Just to make sure you are aware of this, the film ends with
five minutes of outtakes of him attempting the stunts.  Usually
outtakes are shown along with the credits, but this time they hold the
credits until the outtakes are finished.  One could argue that this
means they are really not outtakes, but who cares.  They are
entertaining, and entertainment is the only motivation for catching a
Jackie Chan film in the first place.  They are not high art.
     The camera loves Jackie.  His smiles are genuine, and his action
sequences are gorgeous set pieces.  Never expected to be realistic, his
demonstrations of physical abilities are meant to dazzle.  The press
materials claim that in this film, "Chan takes his daredevilry to a new
level." I'm not sure about a new level, but the film is certainly more
visually attractive than his last, RUMBLE IN THE BRONX.
     I will not even attempt to outline the plot of FIRST STRIKE since,
as I said already, it is inconsequential.  The action is the show so I
will cover some of it instead.
     The temperature in the film varies widely.  Jackie freezes in the
snow, basks in the coastal sun, and swims underwater.
     The snow scenes are the best.  Dressed in a thin shirt with only a
kid's silly seal pup cap on for warmth, Jackie uses a snowmobile to
chase the bad guy.  He raises his shirt to show us how cold he is.  He
is an actor who is easy to empathize with so when he freezes, you
freeze.  He is hurt and frightened more often than any other action
hero, and here he is forced to spend time swimming in water partially
covered with ice.
     In the best visual in the film, enemy soldiers are hidden in the
snow, unbeknownst to Jackie.  When they start popping up and shooting
their Uzis, their uniforms are sure to garner chuckles from the
viewers.  They wear Ku Klux Klan style robes with white Halloween
skeleton masks.  Much of Jackie's films are played for broad humor, and
the audience is not supposed to take them seriously.  They are pure
James Bond material.
     Jackie also gets to swim underwater and practice his karate moves
on a host of evil characters.  The zinger is that there are man-eating
sharks swimming around to lunch on the fighters.
     I have two small favorites in the film.  First, Jackie stays in an
8,000 square foot hotel room in Australia, and it comes with its own
live koala.  He is really cute.  Actually, if you think about it, he
resembles Jackie.  Their smiles are so similar.
     Second, how do you stop a sharpshooter on a rooftop?  Call forth
an instant array of parasols.  He can't shoot what he can't see.
     And there is so much more.  I didn't even mention the attack of
the killer sea urchins.
     JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE runs about an hour and a half.  The
actors speak many languages, but non-English speaking ones, like
Jackie, are dubbed reasonably effectively into English.  The film is
rated PG-13 for cartoonish violence.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad
language.  The picture would be fine for kids say ten and up.  I had
fun so I am giving the show a mild thumbs up and ** 1/2.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

I can sum up First Strike in one word: awesome. Never in my life have I
seen an actor as insanely dedicated as Jackie Chan. For the simple
reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever
appeared in, he should be awarded greatly.
The same Tom and Jerry formula that was used to make Chan's Rumble in
the Bronx and Supercop so entertaining can be found here as well.
However, First Strike was probably the most exciting out of the three,
for the simple reason that practice makes perfect.
His last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great.
Like Rumble, this film is about the Mafia, the former KGB. Now Chan must
do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the Ukraine against a
group of very large bad men.
The trailer for the film sums it up quite well. First Strike is
action-packed, but the fight scenes are so fast and furious, they almost
have a witty, Italian-like humor to them. 
Jackie Chan is a regular comedian. Well, he's no Eddie Murphy, but he
can really crack you up. For example, he is hanging off a roof and he
humorously taunts his foes to come and get him, as he claims to be the
Korean 007 (that's secret agent James Bond).
Even the plot to this film improved above the others, as a sort-of
twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and Jackie takes the
blame. But never fear, as the Chinese Mafia aids him in uncovering the
truth behind the incident.
With some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy,
First Strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major,
world-wide attention.
Grade: B+, **** out of *****

        The commercials announce, "Jackie Chan fights for 
America..." Yeah, even though Jackie Chan's never been to 
America and this movie was made in Hong Kong. FIRST STRIKE 
is an accurate title for this movie, which isn't nearly as good as 
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. Two more movies like this and he may 
indeed strike out in America. I saw this one the week after its 
release and there were only twenty people in the theater. METRO, 
which opened the same day as FIRST STRIKE, was packed. 
Moviegoers in this hemisphere apparently prefer people who 
speak their language.
        Jackie Chan movies are like porno movies. There's one 
attraction and everyone knows what it is, but you have to sit 
through a bunch of poorly-written dialogue and bad acting to get 
to the good stuff. It's a good thing Chan is a master at what he 
does. The action sequences in his movies are always amazing, 
more so because all the stunts are real -- no blue screens and 
no stuntmen. The actors are the stuntmen, and they do a much 
better job with the stunts than the acting.
        The plot this time is a continuation of the POLICE STORY 
series (which previously brought us the English-dubbed SUPERCOP), 
with Chan working for the Hong Kong government to follow a 
woman to the Ukraine. Her brother has a nuclear device and 
everyone wants it, including the new KGB, not nearly as cagey 
as before. Midway through the movie, Chan's own organization 
turns on him and he has no one to turn to when framed for the 
murder.
        The plot is always convoluted in these movies, and 
always a mere accessory to set up the action, so forgive me if 
I screwed up the details. All you need to know is Chan's the 
good guy and everyone he fights with is the bad guy. As 
always, there's a beautiful Asian woman to protect, only this 
time the woman doesn't get into the act by doing any of the 
action herself. As an employee of UnderWater World (the 
sister theme park of Under Dances With Wolves), she does 
provide the setting for the movie's climactic fight sequence.
        There are four main action sequences in the movie. 
The first comes in the Ukraine with a combination snowmobile / 
snowboard chase that ends with Chan falling from a helicopter 
into an icy river. Next is the Australia scene in which Chan 
is on vacation and two burly men visit his hotel room, followed 
shortly by Chan fending off a school of black belts with a table 
and a step ladder (the best scene in the movie) and the climax 
at UnderWater World, involving sharks, stingrays and a bunch 
of bad guys in wetsuits.
        It's like a real-life James Bond movie because Chan 
and everyone else is doing everything onscreen with no special 
effects. Every Jackie Chan action sequence is eye-popping; 
it's the rest of the movie that seems unbearable. What the 
world needs is an all-action Chan movie with no plot -- a 
greatest hits package, maybe. I mean, my God, the man's 
starred in at least twenty movies. That would improve his 
standing with American audiences, because we all know Chan 
could beat up Arnold, Stallone, Van Damme and the rest using 
only two fingers on his left hand.

Martial arts expert turned movie star Jackie Chan has had a number of
international hits before testing the production markets over here in North
America.  'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Supercop' came out in 1996 and while the
former was an over rated and over hyped disappointment, the latter was decent
entertainment.  Now in 1997 we are subjected to a movie which has to have
Jackie Chan's name in the title.  This movie has considerably less action
than the previous two films mentioned and the humour is both childish and
silly.  Chan is working for the CIA in this movie and a trail of suspicious
circumstances take him around the world and the movie's main setting is
Australia.  He is trying to crack a case involving the Russian mafia which
could lead to stolen nuclear devices being used as a first strike on the
west.  It's difficult to criticze these types of movies because you have to
accept them in many ways for what they are.  There is a terrific scene
involving a chase downhill on skis but many of the action scenes are toned
down and this leaves the audience begging for more.  It has an abrupt ending
where you say "Huh, that's it?"  This is not like reviewing a movie based on
a classic novel or upstanding play or a movie with serious actors.  This
movie is clearly for die hard Jackie Chan fans only and the rest of us will
say, "Well, I can take it or leave it."  That's all I can say about this
movie which doesn't dignify having much more said about it.

First Strike (1996) **** out of ***** - Cast: Jackie Chan. Directed by:
Stanley Tong. Running Time: 85 minutes.
After a brief theatrical run earlier this year, Jackie Chan's latest action
flick "First Strike" arrives on home video. If you enjoyed "Rumble in the
Bronx", you'll probably enjoy this one almost as much.
"First Strike" is known by many other titles, but the main thing you'll need
to know is that it's the fourth in Chan's "Police Story" film series.
"Supercop", the previous Chan film released to theaters, was the third in
that series. I wasn't too impressed with "Supercop", but "First Strike" has
restored my interest.
I usually find the plots of Chan's films unimportant, just time filler
between the incredible action sequences. "First Strike" is no exception. The
story has something to do with the CIA, the KGB, double agents, and a stolen
nuclear warhead. No matter though, as there are numerous spectacular scenes
of action. The stunts and the fight choreography are top-notch. There's a
fight sequence which takes place underwater in a shark tank, which I was
completely ready to dismiss as ridiculous. But somehow, amazingly, the scene
is pulled off in a very credible fashion. Also, as with "Rumble in the
Bronx", the film has a great sense of humor.
"First Strike" is, in many regards, a variation of a James Bond film.
However, instead of an overly calm, over-sexed main character, Chan's
character is an actual human being. He gets hurt when he's hit (which is
often) and he's not-overconfident. Even though he's a master at martial
arts, his countless facial expressions while fighting (or in any of the
action sequences) denote that even he's constantly surprised at what he can
accomplish.
American action movie directors these days seem to think that their audience
is full of idiots who will swallow whatever garbage that's spoon fed to
them. And the number of these horrible action films is rapidly increasing.
Chan's movies consistantly amaze me, as each time I see something I've never
seen before. Our directors could learn a great deal from that, but I doubt
they even have the guts to try.  [PG-13]

It isn't being billed as such, but this is actually the fourth installment
in Jackie's popular Police Story series--and the good news is that it is
indeed a worthy successor to those earlier action gems.   Actually, it's
not surprising that the film's stateside distributors have been downplaying
the films lineage to the earlier police story series, since most of the
earlier police story adventures have yet to recieve widespread distribution
in the united states.  Besides, with a spy versus spy plotline that exists
largely to drop Jackie into a string of life threatening action sequences
spread out across the globe, this film owes as much to the james bond films
of the seventies as it does to Jackie earlier police story action comedies.
This is also one of the first Jackie vehicles that seems designed to
appeal to the western market from its inception--and it is by far the most
successful of the jackie movies to gain widespread distribution in this
country.  Like Rumble in the bronx, this one moves the action from Hong
Kong to a vaguely recognizable western location--in this case a pacific
resort in an australian metropolis.  
But unlike the inferior "rumble," in which Jackie seemed somewhat
constrained by the limited action potential of that film's bogus new york
locations, the star is let loose in a string of
breathtaking set pieces in snow, sea and air.  There are a number of
superbly choreographed fights scenes, including a splendid set piece in
which Jackie employs an aluminum painter's ladder to dazzling effect--I
don't think an inanimate object has been as thrilling since Fred Astaire
stepped out with that hat rack back in Hollywood's golden age.  Best of
all, the film's breakneck plot allows Jackie plenty of opportunity to
demonstrate his deft sense of physical comedy--which is a quality that's
been somewhat lacking in most of the star's previous stateside releases.
Highly recommended to Jackie's fans, I think this would also serve as the
perfect introduction to Jackie's magic for those of you wondering what the
hub bub is all about.

     The Hong-Kong-based Jackie Chan has been making a rather free-form
series of crime films which are best known as his POLICE STORY films.
Depending on how you count them, FIRST STRIKE is either the fourth or
fifth film in this series.  It is probably the fourth, but another
film, PROJECT S, was released as if it were part of the POLICE STORY
series and called by alternate titles that include POLICE STORY 4 and
SUPERCOP 2.  That almost makes sense because SUPERCOP was an alternate
title of POLICE STORY 3. In general, the more titles a film can be
given the more people who will see it a second time not realizing they
have seen it before.  In any case, this time around Chan is departing
from the police motif and making a sort of poor man's James Bond film.
And he has the action scenes down pretty well.  In fact, his film has
better stunts than most Bond films.  The only problem is that at a time
when the James Bond plots are deteriorating, they are still better and
much more complex than a Chan plot.  Chan's film is little more than an
excuse to string together a series of admittedly pretty exciting action
scenes.  One has the distinct feeling that the stunts are planned
first, then a plot is written to connect the stunts.  Not that Chan is
not a wonder to watch.  When Chan gets going he is a marvel of grace
and at times his stunts are difficult to believe.  But while this film
tries to be like a Bond film--not all that ambitious a goal,
particularly of late--FIRST STRIKE is less like a spy film than it is
like a collection of circus acts.
     It would almost be a mistake to say that FIRST STRIKE has a plot.
Basically there is just enough so that Chan can get into a series of
fights.  Jackie (played by Jackie Chan for the first time under
something approaching his own name) has performed well in a mission for
the CIA and they have decided to ask him to go on another mission
almost as a perk.  Jackie is to fly from Hong Kong to Ukraine, just
watching a beautiful woman whom the CIA is following.  Once he gets to
the far end he can have a short vacation at the expense of the CIA.
But at the far end he finds there is more involved in the case than he
expected when he sees what appears to be a kidnapping.  Soon Chan is
chasing through snow pursued by soldiers in white parkas and what looks
like white hockey masks.  Not long after he is fighting muscle-bound
assassins proportioned like TV's The Tick.  There are a few
complications in the plot, a few silly comedy situations, and a few
fights using props at hand.  While the centerpiece of RUMBLE IN THE
BRONX was a fight involving a grocery basket, this time he does
considerably more with a folding ladder.
     What Chan is making are not films in the traditional sense.
Instead he is showing off for the camera, taking risks that probably no
other actor making films today would dare.  And Chan makes no secret of
the fact that a lot of times things go awry as he is filming and he
goes through a lot of physical pain to create the stunts he is showing
us.  More frequently than most other actors would tolerate, things go
very wrong and he comes near to physical injury.  When he jumps off a
cliff and grabs for the skid of a helicopter I think we know that it is
probably not a real cliff, but also that there is a real physical
danger to Chan to even shoot the scene.  We watch him with a
fascination that is almost perverse as he takes one dangerous risk
after another and that is the real soul of his films, knowing we are
seeing real danger.  And so nobody doubts that Chan is taking real
risks, he includes his out-takes collection at the end to prove how
close he really came near to serious injuries.  In what plot there is,
the characters other than Chan become props almost as much as the
inanimate objects around which he flows.  Nobody does much acting in
one of his films and Chan does little but a little mugging for the
camera.  Chan is the only character who has a chance to be a character
and he does not take that acting part of his work seriously.
     FIRST STRIKE--there is no explanation of the title of the film, by
the way--is a lampoon of a Bond film and J. Peter Robinson plays along
at times giving us imitation John Barry music, but something short of
the real thing.  Chan has some comic talent and appears to enjoy living
dangerously.  But most of what it would take to make this film really
tick is still missing.  I rate FIRST STRIKE a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.

It's hard to review a Jackie Chan movie, for the sheer reason that if
you've written one, you've written one for all of his films.  First Strike
is no different.  Jackie Chan movies are not to be seen for an intricate
story or immense character development.  Rather they are seen for the
incredible action and the death-defying stunt work.
The story in First Strike that is use to string along the action scenes
goes like this:  A double agent has stolen a nuclear warhead in which he is
to delivery to some Russian Mafia guys in Australia.  The action takes
place in the Ukraine (Canada substituting) and Australia.
The stunts in First Strike are most impressive.  They include Jackie
fighting with all sorts of different objects (ladders, tables, toxic fish).
 They also include Jackie fighting in all different locations, snowfields,
underwater with large sharks, and hanging onto the edge of a building.  And
the most impressive of them all is the one in which Jackie flies off a
cliff and grabs onto a flying helicopter.  My most favorite scene is the
one where Jackie takes on a half of a dozen men with sticks.  He does this
with the creative use of tables, chairs, brooms, and a ladder!
The humor is laid on thick in First Strike, and many times I found myself
laughing out loud at the silliness on screen.
First Strike seems to be the most American of all the Jackie films
re-released in the US so far.  The dubbing is pretty good and the new music
sounds suspiciously like the music from Rumble in the Bronx (both scores
are done by J. Peter Robinson).
When you see First Strike don't expect anything but pure action and humor.
And if you can do this, you'll enjoy First Strike.  But, expectations or
not, First Strike is yet another Jackie Chan movie that you should see.

Cast: Jackie Chan, Jackson Lou, Chen Chun Wu, Bill Tung 
Director: Stanley Tong 
Producer: Barbie Tung 
Screenplay: Stanley Tong, Nick Tramontane, Greg Mellott, and Elliot Tong 
Cinematography: Jingle Ma 
Music: J. Peter Robinson 
U.S. Distributor: New Line Cinema 
Dubbed into English 
     Jackie Chan as James Bond???  Take away the superspy guns and 
gorgeous women, and that's exactly what JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE 
(released internationally as POLICE STORY 4) offers fans.  It's all 
here:  cool cars, neat gadgets, and globetrotting adventure (locations 
include Hong Kong, the Ukraine, and Australia).  In fact, given Chan's 
undeniable gift for mixing physical comedy and nimble, no-holds-barred 
action, one might reasonably expect FIRST STRIKE to out-Bond Bond, 
except for one small detail -- this movie lacks even the semblance of a 
plot. 
     But the virtual absence of a story isn't the biggest problem.  
After all, no one could claim that movies like MOONRAKER or A VIEW TO A 
KILL are pinnacles of narrative complexity.  Rather, the chief flaw 
evident in FIRST STRIKE is that the script spends too much time trying 
to explain the inexplicable.  Since very little makes sense in the first 
place, why waste nearly an hour dragging down an otherwise-enjoyable 
film with pointless exposition?  The unfortunate result is that 
significant chunks of FIRST STRIKE end up being extremely boring.  
Instead of watching Chan twist his body into pretzel-like shapes and 
kick butt, we're forced to listen to bad guys talk about why they're 
doing what they're doing. 
     So what is the story?  It has something to do with Jackie, a Hong 
Kong police officer, getting involved with a CIA mission in the Ukraine.  
He ends up on the trail of a shady figure who's trying to sell a nuclear 
missile to the New Russian Mafia.  Jackie soon becomes a marked target, 
especially once he makes contact with Tsui (Jackson Lou), the man with 
the missile, and his sister, Annie (Chen Chun Wu).  Jackie's mission 
takes him from the frozen wastes of the Ukraine to Australia, where he 
finds creatures far more deadly than the koalas that inhabit his hotel 
suite. 
     As always, the stunts are the centerpiece -- the real reason to sit 
through so much useless, extraneous material and painful, dubbed 
dialogue.  A brief snowmobile chase is followed by a snowboarding 
sequence that's accompanied by pseudo-Bond music.  Later, there's an 
amusing fight with a traditional Bond-type "big guy" (Jaws without the 
teeth) that ends with Chan jumping from ledge to ledge near the top of a 
high rise hotel.  The best sequence is an extended fight that has Chan 
using everything at his disposal -- chairs, tables, ladders, and even a 
scaffolding -- to fend off several martial arts opponents.  Finally, at 
the end, there's an underwater battle that not only has Chan outdueling 
human opponents but a shark as well.   
     As always, the stunts are precisely choreographed, and the mistakes 
can be seen in the end-of-the-film outtakes.  However, editing during 
the rest of FIRST STRIKE borders on inept, further muddying an already 
chaotic storyline.  More than once, I found myself wondering what the 
hell was going on.  There's no denying that Chan excels at what he does 
-- transforming generic fights into brilliantly creative, often funny 
explosions of comic-book style violence.  In fact, he's so much fun to 
watch that it's almost worth sitting through the banal parts of the 
movie to enjoy him at work.  But, on balance, it may be better to wait 
for the videotape for this particular excursion.  That way, if boredom 
sets in, the next good scene is only a quick fast-forward ahead.

     Try to keep up, there will be a test later:  JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST
STRIKE is the American theatrical release of the Hong Kong film POLICE
STORY 4: FIRST STRIKE, which was the sequel to POLICE STORY 3: SUPERCOP,
which was released in America last year as just plain SUPERCOP.  Then
there was another sequel to SUPERCOP, which also was called POLICE STORY 4
but was more widely known as PROJECT S, though that is something of a
tangent.  In the earlier POLICE STORY films, Jackie Chan's character was
called Chen Chia-chu; now in FIRST STRIKE, he is simply Jackie.  The
strange re-release patterns inspired by Chan's sudden American popularity
has made it nearly impossible to make any sense of the POLICE STORY
chronology, if making sense of things like this matter to you.  FIRST
STRIKE itself makes only a rudimentary kind of sense, but Chan's
hair-raising stunts and affable demeanor rarely require much set-up to be
enjoyable.
     Jackie, a Hong Kong cop, is on an assignment for the American CIA to
watch a woman called Natasha (Grishajeva Nonna) as the film opens, a
simple enough task on an airplane to the Ukraine.  It becomes less simple
when Natasha turns out to be smuggling American dollars to a man named
Tsui, dollars which will be used to purchase a Ukranian nuclear warhead
for sale on the black market.  Jackie is soon recruited by a Russian
intelligence agent named Gregor (Jouri Petrov) to track down Tsui, and
heads to Australia where Tsui's sister Annie (Chen Chun Wu) works at an
aquatic theme park.  Though Jackie is able to find Annie, he also finds
that Tsui's motives are unclear, and that Gregor may have a dark agenda of
his own.
     FIRST STRIKE is the third Jackie Chan feature in less than a year to
get an American release, following RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and SUPERCOP, and
it is certainly the biggest production of the three.  There are a couple
of off-hand references to James Bond in FIRST STRIKE, and that seems to be
the vibe director Stanley Tong is going for this time around.  A chase
sequence involving gun-toting skiers is straight out of FOR YOUR EYES
ONLY; the underwater battles in a shark tank with oxygen the most prized
possession is vintage THUNDERBALL.  The scenery shifts from Hong Kong to
the Ukraine to Australia, serving up a few sacrificial vehicles
(helicopters, a funeral carriage) for big-time explosions.  Throw in a
Saul Bass opening credits sequence and a vodka martini and you might think
007 had become a celibate Asian.
     Unfortunately, while FIRST STRIKE is the grandest of Chan's American
releases, it is also the least charming, for most of the same reasons.
Jackie Chan films don't work because of large scale set pieces; they work
because Chan himself is extremely personable and because his unmatched
fight choreography can make you giddy with pleasure.  The moments when
Chan gets to show his stuff up close are wonderful -- he flips through
windows as though he were made of paper, dances across rooftops, uses an
inflatable pool toy to walk quite literally on water.  The extended
sequence where he takes on four men by turning a broom, papier mache
dragon heads and an eight foot ladder into weapons is one of the most
spectacular hand-to-hand combat sequences I have ever seen on screen, a
combination of martial arts and acrobatics edited with astonishing
fluidity.  While the more elaborate bits fall flat with ho-hum
familiarity, the seven minutes of that one fight sequence make FIRST
STRIKE worth seeing.
     The very end of that sequence may be just as indicative of what makes
a Jackie Chan action film unique.  After battling the four opponents to a
standstill, Jackie watches a dozen new foes arrive, and slumps to the
ground in resignation.  As superhuman as Chan can be on screen, he is also
quite human in his persona.  In one clever scene, Jackie exchanges blows
with a massive Russian in typical chop-socky fashion, assumes his standard
preparatory fighting stance, then cringes at the punishment he has just
absorbed.  He doesn't endear himself to the audience by tossing off dreary
one-liners; he simply plays a guy, sometimes silly and sometimes
embarrassed, who happens to be able to defy gravity.  JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST
STRIKE is a terminally dopey spy thriller with anyone else in the lead
role.  Jackie Chan alone is enough to make the thought of FIRST STRIKE 2
-- or is that SUPERCOP 3, or POLICE STORY 5? -- somewhat appealing.
