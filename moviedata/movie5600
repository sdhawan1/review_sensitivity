         It's a rare film that looks as gorgeous as director John
Boorman's "Where the Heart Is." The vibrant colors and clever art
direction are delicious eye candy. Unfortunately, Boorman and his
daughter Telsch wrote a script to accompany these plush visuals, and
it's positively atrocious. The end result is like trying to tour an art
gallery during a fire drill: Sure, there's plenty to look at, but you
still just want to get out of there. Fast.
 Dabney Coleman, not exactly breaking any new ground for
himself, plays a grouchy, unenlightened demolition magnate who's
convinced his artsy children (Uma Thurman, Suzy Amis and David Hewlett)
will never make it in the real world. So he throws them out of the
mansion and puts them up in a ramshackle house in one of New York's less
attractive neighborhoods. But a cruel twist of fate throws the family
back together again, with no money, but now equipped with the greater
happiness that comes from love and understanding.
 The screenplay could have been lifted from any random night of
idiotic TV sitcoms and the Boormans dress it up with some of the most
precious and highfalutin dialogue this side of a college theater party.
It's a groan a minute.
 The varied cast members behave as if they were all acting in
different movies. Joanna Cassidy screeches and flutters annoyingly as
Coleman's flighty wife, while Crispin Glover does his usual
beyond-the-fringe number as a fashion designer who pretends to be gay in
the hopes of getting ahead. Only Thurman makes a pleasant impression,
imparting an ethereal air to her Stevie Nicks-ish character. Almost
everyone else, like the film itself, makes you wish you'd just stayed
home. James Sanford
