     CAPSULE: A series of killings, each by a different killer seems to
have elements in common.  One killer may be using mind control to avoid
being caught.  A Japanese film with an effective concept for a serial
killer who would rival Hannibal Lector.  Rating:  6 (0 to 10), high +1
(-4 to +4)  Spoiler warning: nearly any description of the premise will
be something of a spoiler.
   - Director is Kiyoshi Kurosawa has done many films in Japan, mostly
     crime films, but this is first international film.  It is a
     different idea and one that is likely to be copied, or would be if
     it were used in a film that got seen in this country.
   - There are a series of almost identical crimes, which would point
     to one killer, but in each case the killer is caught and it is a
     different person each time.
   - Atmospheric horror-mystery.  Reminiscent of FALLEN.
   - Subdued color which creates a mood as effectively as black and
     white.
   - Pace is a little slow at times due to some long and lingering
     camera shots.
   - Detective trying to piece thing together in spite of personal
     problems with a disturbed wife.
   - Complex film with many things going on at once.
   - Slow but effective horror film with deeper meanings about mind
     control.  Themes similar to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

"Cure" by itself is confusing. It's awfully slow, and takes a while for 
payoff, if such an ending can really be called that. The story follows a 
detective who is investigating a series of murders where the victims have Xs 
slashed into their throats, usually by their best friends. When the 
mysterious amnesiac the police think has planted hypnotic suggestions into 
the murder's brains comes in for interrogation, things become only more 
difficult. As the investigation continues, our detective hero finds himself 
entangled in the mastermind's web of thought, and finds his feelings about 
his amnesiac wife souring. 
Got all that? Seattle International Film Festival 2001's emerging master 
Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no relation to Akira) peppers his story with long, gazing 
shots that have little to do with what's going on, and then inserts important 
plot points in quick flashes. The result is a lumbering thriller that winds 
you up on its little finger, and then lets you off with absolutely no reward, 
and certainly no purpose. This is just another violent, action/gangster film 
from Japan. 
After the film in a question and answer session, Kurosawa explained what was 
going on. I wondered if we had just seen the same film. While moody and 
atmospheric, the filmmaker's job to accurately convey the story he imagined 
fails. Kurosawa is emerging, but he's hardly a master. Avoid this one.

     As I write, smoke and debris envelope lower Manhattan and the Pentagon on a
day of incomprehensible horror and unforeseeable implications.  We will know
more by the time this appears in print, but it seems to be the coordinated work
of suicide terrorists, controlled by authorities and allegiances as yet unknown.
     Perhaps in the grip of today's context it is difficult not to filter
everything through the trauma of this evil.  Writer/director Kiyoshi (no
relation to Akira) Kurosawa's 1997 film is about a series of grisly, ritualized
murders, connected in style but committed by different people.  The murderers
are all easily found; they know what they've done, but they don't know why.  `It
seemed like the natural thing to do at the time,' one says.  The victims are
strangers, friends, loved ones.  Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho of `Shall We
Dance') and his psychologist colleague Sakuma (Tsuyoshi Ujiki) grope for
theories (`The devil made them do it'), and finally hit upon the answer: the
killers seem to have been operating under the hypnotic control of a shadowy
stranger, a veritable Johnny Appleseed of murder.  
     The premise is a shaky one in literal terms.  Most of what we know about
hypnosis from a layman's perspective (which is to say, from movies and TV shows)
suggests that people cannot be hypnotized to do something abhorrent to them, and
this is touched on but not pursued in `Cure'.  And the ease with which people
are brought under hypnotic trance also stretches credulity.  In the classic `The
Manchurian Candidate', Laurence Harvey's hypnotic suggestion is triggered by a
playing card, but the groundwork has been laid over months of captivity and
treatment.  Here the trigger is just a simple, but there's no preparation, and
the effects are instantaneous and devastating.
     But there are many layers of darkness at work here, and Kurosawa may be
suggesting that the most unimaginable atrocities are not abhorrent to us at some
level.  
     The story cuts away from Takabe's investigation of the murders periodically
to follow the wanderings of a rootless young man whose name, from a label in his
overcoat, seems to be Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara).  He claims to have no idea who
he is or where he is.  He suffers from amnesia of the `How long have you had
this problem?' `What problem?' variety.  The suspicion grows from time to time
that he may be dissembling, but we never know for sure.  There are many things
we never know for sure, including who he is, where he comes from, and what he
wants.  Motives are almost entirely absent from the eerie world Kurosawa creates
here; there may even be something supernatural at work.  `No one understands
what motivates a criminal,' the psychologist Sakuma repeats on several
occasions, and while one might take issue with that as blanket truth, it applies
here.   
     Complicating Detective Takabe's job and distracting his professional focus
is the fact that his wife also suffers from a degenerative amnesia.  This
personal tragedy ties him with particular force to the man he is investigating,
who seems to know more than he should about the detective's situation and even
what goes on inside his head.
     Kurosawa keeps his colors muted and his camera at a distance from the
action for the most part, telling the story with dispassionate coolness.  He
strews the field with questions, but is not generous with answers.  You'll leave
the theater baffled by things that have no apparent explanation  who is the man
in the dry cleaners, and what is his relationship with Takabe?  `Cure' is
intriguing, frustrating, and sometimes annoying.  It's also hypnotic.  Even when
the crimes are solved and the guilty brought to bay, there is none of the sense
of closure that we expect.  In a way that disconcertingly reflects the world
around us, something ominous and ungraspable still hangs in the air, refusing to
be exorcized by the closing credits.

If you've been wondering whether someone can make a film as moody,
atmospheric and downright disturbing as Se7en, you'll want to start pleading
with your local arthouse theatres to land Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. Actually,
it's more of a blend of Memento's amnesia, The Manchurian Candidate's
mind-control and power of suggestion, and the bent serial killer from the
aforementioned Se7en.
Yakusho Koji (Shall We Dance?) plays Detective Kenichi Takabe, a man clearly
beaten down from both dealing with his mentally unstable wife and his
inability to solve a string of bizarre murders.  The victims all have a
large "X" carved into their throat and chest, but the killings have an even
more bizarre link.  The murderers are always found near the crime scene but
have no recollection of committing any crime.  To make matters worse,
they're usually friends and acquaintances of the victims, too.
Enter a peculiar psychology student named Mamiya Kunio (Hagiwara Masato),
who might be connected to the murders but suffers from acute amnesia, making
him impossible to question as he can't remember anything that happened more
than a few minutes ago.  Mamiya keeps asking, "Who are you?" over and over
again (his memory is much worse than Leonard Shelby's), but is he merely
trying to figure out who you are, or is he trying to get you to question
your own identity?
Kurosawa, who won an award at Cannes this year for Séance, uses long shots
almost exclusively in Cure, which, amazingly, is his first film to be
released in the United States.  The result makes the film a bit creepier,
sort of like you're spying on the characters, which makes everything more
realistic.  It's one bleak film, and its ending would make Kevin Spacey
proud.  But if you're the kind of idiot that needs every loose end neatly
tied up before the credits roll, you'll want to skip this and see America's
Sweethearts again.
