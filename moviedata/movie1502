Rob Cohen's "The Skulls" is a handsomely produced disaster of a movie, filled 
with such ludicrous plotting and inconsistencies that it has to be seen to be 
believed. At least when Universal Pictures hired Shane Hurlbut as the 
cinematographer, they got their money's worth, which is more than can be said 
about virtually everyone and everything else involved in the making of this 
"thriller," a so-called "'The Firm' for teens." The problem is that that 1993 
Tom Cruise-starrer was also a dumbed-down version of a John Grisham novel. 
Drop its IQ down yet another 50 points, transform its characters into college 
students, and what you are left with is "The Skulls."
Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) is a former street kid whose key to being 
accepted at the prestigious Yale University is his expertise on the college's 
famed rowing team. Planning to go to law school after graduation, he is 
unsure of how he is going to manage it, considering he has twenty bucks in 
the bank, considerably less than the annual $45,000 tuition fee. Lurking 
about the campus is a much-talked-about secret society called The Skulls (if 
it is such a secret, how come everyone knows about it?), to which we are 
informed at the on-set that at least two of the United States' presidents 
have been members. Once initiated, there is no exempting, but The Skulls 
promise inductees unlimited amounts of wealth and fortune, as well as a few 
trophy women to go along with it. 
Despite the warnings of Luke's two best friends, Will (Hill Harper) and Chloe 
(Leslie Bibb), he is chosen to join The Skulls, and without hesitation, 
accepts. A pair of new members are chosen to be soul mates, and Luke is 
partnered with Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), whose father, Judge Litten 
Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), coincidentally, is the head of the society. Luke 
is overjoyed to later discover that $20,000 has been added to his bank 
account, but being a member of The Skulls means inevitably slighting Will and 
Chloe, whom he is secretly in love with. Then an apparent suicide of someone 
close to Luke occurs on campus, but evidence points to foul play, and it 
becomes believed that the victim was murdered. All suspicions of Luke point 
to The Skulls being involved in a cover-up scheme.
What can be said about "The Skulls" other than it's one of the most 
unintentionally silly movies so far this year, not to mention one of the 
worst? The screenplay, by John Pogue, is a real howler, and should never have 
been given the chance to see the light of day. In one scene, a female 
character is chased across campus in broad daylight, which conveniently 
appears to be deserted. In another, Luke is drugged to an almost catatonic 
state, to the point where saliva is uncontrollably dribbling out the side of 
his mouth. Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, he jumps right into a 
conversation as if nothing had happened. Was he just playing an April Fool's 
joke on everyone, and decided it would be funny to pretend he was a human 
vegetable? And who could forget the laughable duel climax, complete with real 
guns, that takes place in what looked like the courtyard of the school?
The dialogue is no better, with one distressingly stilted scene in which 
Luke, Will, and Chloe discuss the history of The Skulls, reciting dialogue 
that not for a second seems natural, but simply an excuse to relay to the 
audience some background information. "The Skulls" might have at least been 
funny had director Rob Cohen (who made the far superior 1996 action film, 
"Daylight") and screenwriter Pogue let the audience know that it was meant as 
a comedy. To my dismay, however, it appears like the movie is very well 
attempting to be a serious-minded thriller. 
"The Skulls" marks the debut of Joshua Jackson (TV's "Dawson's Creek") in a 
lead film role, after supporting parts in 1998's "Urban Legend" and 1999's 
"Cruel Intentions," and it's unfortunate that he had to choose such an 
unusually bad movie to take that next step in his career. All other actors 
are handed throwaway roles, except for Paul Walker (1998's "Pleasantville"), 
who makes next to no impression, and Leslie Bibb (TV's "Popular"), who is the 
only one in the cast who projects even the slightest hint of intelligence. 
Bibb has a bright screen presence, but she is surrounded by such inanity that 
all she can do is struggle to come away from the wreckage unscathed (she 
succeeds, for the most part).
Worst of all, when "The Skulls" isn't downright awful, it's just a chore to 
sit through. Dull and oddly outdated, only the lush photography by Hurlbut, 
accentuating its gorgeous Toronto-based setting, saves the picture from being 
a surefire cure for insomniacs. On second thought, maybe Universal should 
have hired someone less accomplished to work as cinematographer. That way, 
when viewers would fall into a deep slumber for its duration, it would cause 
them to forget that such an absurd motion picture was actually ever committed 
to celluloid. It would also save the actors from any further embarrassment.

Preposterous with a capital P.  THE SKULLS is directed with ham-handed
excess and predictability by Rob Cohen, who last gave us Sylvester
Stallone in the ludicrous DAYLIGHT.  DAYLIGHT, on the other hand, was a
masterpiece of plausibility and subtlety next to this absurd film.
The young cast of THE SKULLS, mainly television and celluloid
heartthrobs, play characters who have the moral compass of people in the
presence of strong magnets.  As scripted by John Pogue, the would-be
thriller has a Swiss-cheese plot that provides many unintentional
laughs.  The over-the-top cinematography (Shane Hurlbut) is heavy on
bright lights bathing every room, and the creepy music (Randy Edelman)
sounds like an amalgamation of every thriller made in the past decade.
The film is about a nefarious, 200-year-old secret society called "the
Skulls." The movie's pretentious opening text claims that at least 3 of
our presidents have been members of such societies, which appear to
occur only in Ivy League colleges.  (While presidents probably have been
members of secret societies, the implication that these societies are
quite evil undoubtedly isn't true.)
Exactly how secret is the Skulls? You know the movie is in trouble from
the beginning when you learn that everyone on campus seems to know who
is a member and that the Skulls even have a huge building where they
meet.  Just to erase any doubt, the edifice has a big skull on top.  So
much for secrecy.
Once we get inside the building, it gets worse.  The set looks like a
gothic dungeon, complete with flaming torches, that appears to be on
loan from a Mel Brooks comedy.
As the story opens, we meet Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson).  He's a poor
townie who is working his way through school.  Although he has never
flown in a jet, he has a crush on Chloe (Leslie Bibb), whose parents own
a private jet.  Of course, they will fall in love.  His best buddy, Will
(Hill Harper), is an investigative reporter for the campus newspaper.
Want to venture a guess as to what might happen to Will?
One could write a small book on the plot's implausibilities.  When Luke
gets a call one night from a stranger, he is told that he has to get to
a pay phone in 40 seconds.  This eventually leads him to a room with
only a glass of some unknown drug and a note instructing him to drink
it.  Although the glass has a skull on it, he drinks it immediately,
assuming that the logo belongs to the skulls and the substance will not
kill him.
When he wakes, it's back to the silly sets.  He is in a coffin on a
large, concrete lily pad, along with a bunch of other swell fellows like
himself.  Actually, they are all filthy rich and not at all like him,
but that's just another of the plot's nonsensical elements.
Luke is partnered with a super-rich kid named Caleb Mandrake (Paul
Walker), who once would not have given him the time of day.  Caleb's
father, Litten (Craig T. Nelson), is a judge on a fast-track to the
Supreme Court.  Litten, the dungeon master, welcomes the new recruits to
the den.  At his side is a corruptible senator (William Petersen), who
is the self-appointed ethics officer of the group.  Any guess on the
accent of such a senator?  Southern, of course.
"We live by the rules; we die by the rules," Litten lectures his young
charges.  This should be taken as a hint as to what will follow.
In the meantime, the guys have a heck of a good time.  Large sums of
money are transferred to their bank accounts, new Ferraris and Porsches
are given to them and model-quality dates are provided for their
amusements.  Caleb -- first among equals -- gets a "date" for each arm.
But not all is well in Skulldom.  A murder in the sanctum sanctorum
causes no end of misery for the young revelers.
It is at this point that the already ridiculous story goes seriously
downhill.  When someone is found hanging by a rope, his friend pulls
down on him, which would kill him if he weren't quite dead.  A key tape
isn't duplicated when there is plenty of time and equipment to do so and
when there is good reason to suspect the tape will be stolen.  A
character is a drugged-out, drooling vegetable one minute and, the next,
is carrying on a lucid discussion of complicated issues.  And the list
goes on and on, ad nauseam.
Perhaps THE SKULLS was meant to be taken as a parody.  Let's hope so.
THE SKULLS runs about 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and language
and would be acceptable for teenagers.

'The Skulls' was such a disappointment.  More than that it was appalling and
downright destined for the 'Dawson's Creek' generation and no one else.  In
fact, this could have been a 'Dawson's Creek' episode where people would
say: "Wow, how bizarre.  I never thought I would ever see an episode like
this".....much in the same way that fans of 'The X-Files' re-acted when they
saw their first humour episode of the show.....the only difference is that
'The X-Files' is usually brilliant and is certainly landmark television.  I
wanted to see this film eagerly because, allegedly, it is based on fact,
however loosely.  It's an intriguing premise.  A group of ivy league
freshmen at a prestigious American university take a vow and become members
of a secret society which amounts to little more than selling you soul to
the devil.  The cars, the cash, the women and the political connections make
you almost untouchable.  The seductive aspect of these creature comforts is
stamped with a hot branding mark on your body in the form of a skull that
makes you a distinct member of the society.  There is also the hidden crypt
where meetings take place, a wrist watch in the form of a skull and a code
of conduct guide in the form of a pocketbook that you are to keep in your
possession at all times.  The movie alleges that three former presidents of
the United States are members and the real life curiosity of the media
prompted them to ask a former president and his son if they're former
members.
Joshua Jackson of television's 'Dawson's Creek' is Luke McNamara, a young
man with a seemingly bright future who gets more than he bargains for when
he joins a secret society with all the trappings mentioned in the above
paragraph.  Luke's closest friends in life are his girlfriend Chloe (Leslie
Bibb) and his best buddy Will (Hill Harper).  Luke makes friends and a fresh
face in his life is Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker).  Caleb's father Judge
Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) is a reigning power within the skulls and
welcomes new members with the aid of Senator Ames Levritt (William Petersen)
and the university provost, Lombard (Christopher McDonald).
As I was watching this film I was reminded of how some film makers bite off
more than they can chew.  This film is the perfect Saturday night popcorn
movie rental when it comes to home video where a group of teenage girls will
gather around their television and swoon over the two young male leads.
Fine, but what about something for the rest of us.  This film is also
unintentionally funny to the worst extent.  It constantly looks like the
actors are trying to pull off dramatic situations and they keep tripping
over themselves and can't find the whirlwind of success in pulling it off.
Director Rob Cohen who made a startlingly brilliant television movie for HBO
in 1998 entitled 'The Rat Pack' which captured perfectly the lives of
entertainers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford,
is at the head of 'The Skulls'.  Cohen also made a fine bio pic of martial
arts legend Bruce Lee in 1993 entitled 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' and
Cohen has a knack for capturing the nostalgia of a certain period with fluid
filming and a brisk pace to shower audiences with entertainment.  He should
have seen the light at the end of the tunnel here.  Writer John Pogue's
screenplay is like a blister driving you mad.  You keep hoping the pain will
go away but it only gets worse.
The climax tries to usher in an old fashioned way for gentlemen to settle
their differences but you can rent Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' to see
it done in a much better fashion.  It's also a climax (again,
unintentionally funny) where you don't care one bit about what happens to
the characters.  I was actually sitting there with my eyes closed and my
hand in front of my face and glancing up every few seconds because it was so
bad and now I guess I'll tell you how I REALLY felt about the movie!
: - )
Oh, well, with a film this bad, we at least know that given the treatment by
this motion picture that if this type of thing does exist in real life, we
know the perpetrators are definitely safe!  But there is no safe part of
this movie which will make you attack the movie theatre's cashier in an
attempt to get your money back.
A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
recommendation.

There are certain beliefs that our society supposedly holds as
universally true. Being nice to other people is a good thing. Thou shalt
not thisandthat.
Then there are those other convictions we secretly live by.
Some of the best films examine our secret dogma and how it affects our
lives and relationships with ourselves and others. The more successful
movies question the truth versus faith and the complex issues involved.
"The Skulls" just takes cheap shots...and does it badly.
The rich and powerful are morally corrupt. Even saints have to
compromise to get ahead. Ultimately that turns out to be a bad idea.
These simplistic doctrines are at the core of this film. No questions.
No exploration. And not much of a story.
Luke (Joshua Jackson) is a poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks
turned star athlete and scholar at an unnamed university that looks
suspiciously like Yale. He wants to go to law school, but lacks the
funds. Until, that is, he's invited to join the Skulls, a secret society.
The Skulls count judges and senators as their members and are an
organized good ole boy network. They will do anything for their brothers
including providing them with new cars, bank accounts, whores and a
career fast track. Didn't George W. Bush belong to one of these?
When one of Luke's buddies shows up dead, he suspects the Skull's
handiwork and wants out. In this junior version of The Firm, he is
stuck for life unless he can come up with a complex plan to outsmart them.
What goes wrong with this film? What doesn't? The acting is third-rate.
Character development is nonexistent. People do things that don't make
sense and say things that no human being would ever utter. The
cinematography is boring. Luke's plan only works by accident. Even the
obligatory sex scene is tame.
Someone should have done a reality check when they were filming this
thing. Our financially strapped hero lives in a luxurious suite posing
as a dorm room. Remarkably, the plot is somehow improbable and predictable.
The movie features mostly missed opportunities. Luke must turn to his
old skills as a petty criminal and enlist the help of techno-savvy
friends he left behind. At this point, the audience is filled with false
hope that something interesting is going to happen with real people. But
it goes nowhere. The scenes are dull and his old friends just disappear
never to show up again.
The story doesn't even tell us what the Skulls are really about. Why
they hold their rituals in the dungeon of the Rue Morgue. Why everyone
and their brother seem to know everything about this super-secret
organization. Why they brand future senators with the skull logo on
their wrists where everyone can see. Why we should care about anything
that happens in this movie.
There is one truth about "The Skulls" that the filmmakers must hope
remains secret. But I think I've just spilled the beans.
(Michael Redman has written this column for quite a while and he belongs
to societies so secret that even he doesn't know about them.)

In preparation for his role in "The Skulls," actor Joshua Jackson
researched the real Yale University secret society, the Skull & Bones,
which served as model for the one portrayed in the thriller. He spoke
with Entertainment Weekly Online about the group, whose roster includes
former presidents William H. Taft and George Bush, as well as current
candidate George W. Bush, and their kinky hazing rituals. Reportedly, an
inductee "proves his worth" by getting shot up with Sodium Pentothal
("truth serum"), lying naked with another potential member for a round
of "Liar's Hell" (a prolonged game of "Truth"), and  get this 
masturbating in a coffin. "If George W. becomes president, I won't be
able to look at him without laughing," said Jackson. "I mean, c'mon, he
was wankin' in a coffin at Yale."
With such freaky background material, it would be reasonable to expect
lots of lurid fun from "The Skulls," but instead we get the kind of
dreary, half-hearted crap that the USA Network routinely palms off as
made-for-TV movies.
Jackson, best known as Pacey from "Dawson's Creek," plays Luke McNamara,
a blue collar kid struggling financially to stay in Ya-- well, they
never actually call it Yale, although you can occasionally spot large
"Y's" prominently affixed in the background. Luke's longtime townie pals
now view him as uppity, so he hangs out with two campus buddies;
crusading writer Will (Hill Harper) and plucky potential girlfriend
Chloe (Leslie Bibb).
Soon enough, Luke receives a cryptic invitation from the Skulls. Despite
warnings from Will about the dangers of shadow organizations ("if it's
secret and powerful, it can't be good"), Luke eagerly follows
instructions and gets drugged into unconsciousness, waking up in a
coffin (presumably, he was too groggy to do any wankin') on a
hilariously phony gothic set covered with other coffin-encased wannabe
Skulls.
With spotlights swooping everywhere (the Skulls are real drama queens),
Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), leader of the group, strides
into the chamber to lay down the law. Each member of the society is
paired with a fellow inductee who will be his "soul mate," offering
emotional support and counsel for life. The Skulls operate from an
exhaustive rule book that covers any possible situation. "Our rules
supersede all others," Litten intones as his soul mate, Senator Ames
Levitt (William Peterson), looks on from the distance. Luke learns that
his soul mate is none other than Litten's pretty boy son, Caleb (Paul
Walker).
Life immediately changes for Luke, as the society deposits thousands in
his bank account, presents him and the other new kids with bright, shiny
sports cars (for a secret society, the Skulls sure are flashy) and hold
grand dinners where dessert is a bevy of glamorous whores.
The party ends when Will turns up dead and Luke uncovers evidence that a
Skull is responsible. The group deems him a threat, leading to the
requisite chases, confrontations, yadda yadda. No cliché is left unused
as the film slogs its way towards a grand finale featuring a good
old-fashioned duel!
Every moment of "The Skulls" is just as idiotic as it sounds. Had the
film explored the concept of secret societies, from the dynamics of the
power structure to the eroticism that lies beneath the rituals and that
"soul mate" business, this could have been interesting. Instead,
director Rob Cohen is satisfied to present a painfully routine movie
that grows sillier with each passing minute. The only mystery in "The
Skulls" is why actors of Craig T. Nelson's caliber agreed to
participate. Surely, the residuals he earns from "Coach" are big enough
that he can afford to pass on garbage like this.

What's the quickest way to sink a movie? You could give Craig T. Nelson 
awkward, burly facial hair for one. Yet there are faster ways. Efficiently 
emulating John Pogue's tedious script for the latest insipid work of Neal H. 
Moritz and company would work. Moritz's production crew brought you last 
year's infamous "Cruel Intentions". Both share ridiculous premises and 
unsatisfying conclusions. What else is there to say? The focus of intrigue 
shifts from rampant sex in this one, and there's no Sarah Michelle Gellar or 
Ryan Phillippe to somewhat save things. Despite cute smiles, Joshua Jackson 
and Paul Walker do not carry this movie, and with the job going to incapable 
supporting actors and director, it's an endless 106-minute work of continuing 
stupidity and boredom. 
Rather than treat these "characters" with actual human names very much 
contrary to their fake emotions, names will not be included in this summary.
An annoyingly ambitious high school guy (Joshua Jackson) meets a gym-head 
boxer from a prestigious family (Paul Walker) at a famous university. 
Punching Bag's father (Craig T. Nelson) is the head of a campus secret 
society called the Skulls, which provides seemingly limitless opportunities 
for its exclusive pick of members. It's the country's largest male clique. 
After some luck in bizarre initiation ceremonies, Red Gloves and Irksome 
Scholar become best friends and even "skull-mates". Oh yes, skull-mates. 
Together they reap benefits of membership which include, but are not limited 
to sports cars, blank checks, rising grades, and bevies of whores. Somehow, 
no young dumb character figures out that heaps of dirty dealings are going on 
behind the scenes. Only when a close friend is murdered do the duo and other 
new Skulls come to their senses and wonder about the group's moral 
activities. Danger engulfs the friends. Will one man honor his father and the 
club, or his friend? Will the other stick with the popular people, or obey 
his conscience? Is there any escape from this dreadful plot?
Director Rob Cohen could have saved half of this with a simple, shameless 
exploitation of his main actors. A cheerfully bad Hollywood teen sex escapade 
hadn't happened since, well, "Cruel Intentions". The actors serve as nothing 
more than eye candy (with "Popular's" Leslie Bibb filling the brainless 
female role) since the actors have miniscule talents. The lengths to keep 
this PG-13 get annoying. Then again, a more adult version of "Skulls" would 
completely lose its target audience. This is the perfect video pick for that 
plucky teenage girl whose brain has received long-term abuse from abrasive 
foreign lip-glosses that you know. No other group of thinking, breathing 
human beings should give wide praise for this thing. Unless they, of course, 
are under the influence of some illegal substance smuggled across the border. 
An example of possible adult praise: "Wow! That suggestively sweaty young man 
looks positively like he's reading a cue card." And that's trying hard.
Does this seem a little mean-spirited? Well then it's accurate. With 
skull-banging inane dialogue, vapid performances, plodding pace, and stark 
predictability this is easily the stinker of the season. It leaves a mood of 
disappointment, because like most bad movies, it could have been great. This 
piece triggers much anger from within for the California film gods. A movie 
is all in the execution, as most know. Too bad someone didn't kill this one 
in time. 
One almost expects Gillian Anderson's character from "The X-Files" to show up 
as a bad pun, but alas, no. Christopher McDonald does show up for added pain 
in viewing though.

Would you swear your allegiance to some stealth secret society seducing you
with insurmountable sums, slick sports cars, sexy slender sisters,
scholarships to study law at several esteemed schools essentially securing
your prospective professional success? Struggling to pay the bills at his
Ivy League University, city-kid Joshua Jackson sighs, "My future's killing
me," then succumbs to the seduction as the price to calm the side effects of
entry into the Skulls skyrockets.
A group of ten recruited college studs (only 2 of which matter) stumble in
the dark through a mysterious and spooky initiation process. The two: our
hero Joshua and the typecast teen jerk Paul Walker.
There's actually a very exciting long boat race earlier on. Meant to endear
us to the main character (which admittedly, it does), the race itself is
more climactic than the picture's climax. The film is still intriguing as we
(along with Josh) learn about this elite secret society membering members of
congress etc. Why the club is called "Skulls," is never revealed - probably
it just sounds cool. To celebrate the new groups "rebirth," dressed in
expensive duds and rubbing shoulders with senators and judges, the music
rolls over to rock, a flock of gorgeous babes slow-mo into the room, and the
young new talent leave the party in $50,000 sports car of their choice. It's
a very slick sequence.
Not too long after, however, the film takes a dive into "Starsky and
Hutchdom," with a TV 70's bad guy pursues good guy into a fenced in alley
staple, that detours into a car chase worthy of "Dukes of Hazard." Oh sure
that can be fun, but in a film that sets itself up as clever, darkly
sinister and proudly bares the name "Skulls?" It's hardly stately. The good
old fashion duel at then end doesn't vindicate it in the least, nor is it
unpredictable.
Joshua Jackson pulls down a strong performance as does Paul Walker, but the
uneven dialogue dips into the silly. Despite it's excellent cinematography,
"Skulls" fails to "flesh out" a good premise.

"A skull above all others," a red robed member of the secret society
proclaims in Rob Cohen's new film, "The Skulls". John Pogue, previously
responsible for writing such "masterpieces" as "US Marshalls" and "Eraser",
sprinkles this kind of inane, meaningless dialogue throughout the movie. I
suppose I shouldn't have expected anything more out of a movie like this
one, but somehow I thought the presence of Joshua Jackson ("Dawson's Creek",
"Urban Legend"), one of the more talented young actors in Hollywood, might
spark some life into this outing. After an interesting, if predictable,
opening sequence involving a rowing race (I didn't even know rowing was a
college sport), my hopes were going up. Instead, the movie snowballs
downhill, getting worse and worse until it reaches one of the most
ridiculous endings I've ever seen.
Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) is a champion rower for his college's rowing
team, having led the school to three consecutive victories. His abilities
have attracted the attention of The Skulls, a secret society composed of
students and graduates from the university. To join their ranks, he has to
complete a series of tasks with the other hopefuls, including the local rich
kid, Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), son of the society's chairman, Litten
Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson). While membership in the society alienates Luke's
friends, Will (Steve Harris) and Chloe (Leslie Bibb), it's making his
college dreams come true. However, this particular society may be a little
darker than Luke first suspects, and he learns they're not above covering up
things like murder.
I'm not sure just where to start with this ridiculous movie. Alright, I'm
going to go over the film's good points first, which shouldn't take long.
The music is, at times, rather nice. Starting with a somewhat creepy
sounding score and changing into a more uplifting one during the rowing
scene, the score is nicely used to highlight key scenes. Unfortunately, the
soundtrack changes rather suddenly into a series of modern rock and rap
songs. The only other high point I can think of in this moronic film is that
there are one or two mildly suspensful scenes, though I can't seem to
remember what exactly they involved. Except for these two points this is
just another unbelievable, boring, shallow teen flick which will somehow
draw in the high school crowd.
The actors here are, for the most part, unconvincing at best and laughably
bad at worst. Jackson himself appears to know what a lousy movie he is in
and sleepwalks his way through his scenes. Leslie Bibb ("Private Parts") is
more than a little unconvincing as his love interest, and Hill Harper ("In
Too Deep") is given very little to do as Jackson's best friend. Craig T.
Nelson (Coach, "The Devil's Advocate") plays a character who is nothing more
than a cardboard cutout villain. The worst performance of the movie comes
from Paul Walker ("Brokedown Palace"), who seems to take his part very
seriously, despite scenes where he is asked to do things like look up to the
heavens and cry NO! The only decent performance comes from William L.
Petersen ("Gun Shy"), playing a southern senator and doing a fairly good
impersonation of Bill Clinton.
I think the thing in this movie that most grated on my nerves was the
unbelievably cheesy dialogue. The fact that some of these actors were able
to say their lines while keeping a straight face is remarkable. I do hope
Joshua Jackson is able to obtain a better script for his next film, however
since his next movie is going to be called "Gossip" I'm not holding my
breath. Despite all the horrible ideas you see brought to life throughout
"The Skulls", nothing can prepare you for the insanely horrible ending. The
movie runs about 100 minutes, which feels about an hour longer than that. I
can't think of anyone I'd recommend it to unless you're looking for a few
good, unintentional laughs. I give "The Skulls" a generous two out of five
stars.

Having lived in New Haven for many years, I often wondered when Hollywood would capture the suspense and influence inherent in influential, century-old secret societies like Yale's Skull and Bones. Obviously, screenwriter John Pogue (a Yale dropout) and director Ron Cohen sensed the intrigue but they've failed to capture the drama in this bland, formulaic, heavy-handed dud.  Joshua Jackson (TV's "Dawson's Creek") plays a pre-law student at a prestigious Ivy League university only identified as "Y" but with tell-tale blue-and-white colors on its crew jerseys. Being from a working-class background, at first he's thrilled when he's tapped by the powerful Skulls, primarily because, as a member, he'll get pre-acceptance to law school, along with tuition, plus several other enticing amenities that money can buy - like $20,000 in his depleted bank account and a new car. But after his best buddy and room-mate (Hill Harper) is killed while delving into the Skulls' malevolent li!
ttle secrets for the college newspaper, he begins to have second-thoughts - which are aided and abetted by his intended blue-blood girl-friend (Leslie Bibb).  If you remember that President George Bush was a member of Yale's Skull and Bones, along with his son George W., you'll catch the nasty innuendoes about a father-son team hierarchy - only here, it's a prominent judge (Craig T. Nelson) who's aiming at the Supreme Court while his weasly son (Paul Walker) is up to no good on campus. And William Peterson does what looks like a President Clinton imitation. The grisly, garish initiation rites are straight out of the coffins in a Gothic horror novel. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Skulls" is a silly, brainless 1.  Numskulls is more like it - so don't even bother renting the eventual video.

Starring-Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Leslie Bibb, Craig T. Nelson,
Hill Harper, William Peterson, Christopher McDonald and Steve Harris
Director-Rob Cohen
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Universal Pictures - 03/00
`The Skulls' is a laughably bad thriller, a teen-orientated doppelganger
of `The Firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a
hypnotic stupor. Certain moments are so preposterous that I nearly
herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter. I chuckled
incessantly, all the way home. Let me share.
The Skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of Yale
(designed, I'm sure, to mirror the actual Skull & Bones from the same
college). Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), a townie and local varsity
rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year, highlights
the latest Skull scouting report. Despite some anxiety and caution from
others, Luke accepts entry into the organization. Soon after, he finds
himself surrounded by beautiful women, driving a new car and marveling
at the $20, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account. Yeah, dude,
pretty good deal eh? But Luke soon learns that the membership is
somewhat suffocating; when circumstances become extreme, there is no way
he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable. The
premise, although lacking in originality, certainly offers its share of
potential intrigue and suspense.
Unfortunately, `The Skulls' is neither intriguing, nor suspenseful, nor
anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting. It's just
another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack, the stars....
but not the script. `The Skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of
entertainment value, with the screenplay, by Jon Pogue, immediately
becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . First off, upon
their initiation into The Skulls, each new member has to have a skull
branded onto their arm. Afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch
that conveniently covers up the scar. Will they never take this watch
off? And what if they forget it by their bedside? Perhaps their secret'
society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand
new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed.
On top of this, they are each given a rulebook and a key to
headquarters. Gee, why not member T-shirts? But my favorite bit is this:
the voting committee for The Skulls does not bother with individual
agree' or disagree' notions when making collective decisions. They are
given official Skull paddles. When flipped to one side, they indicate
the member agrees with the proposal. Facing the opposite way means a
disagreement. Wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally? Hell no.
They have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote, and maybe afterward
they can play Ping-Pong.
I'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details, but the humiliating
dialogue is enough to send one into arrest. The cast, meanwhile,
combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `Dawson's Creek'
crowd, and fuses the two together, ensuring that the embarrassment will
be a mutually shared union throughout. But not entirely. Accomplished
actors like Craig T. Nelson (as Skulls chairman Judge Litten Mandrake)
and William Peterson (as fellow board member Senator Levritt) are dealt
pathetic villain caricatures, and look suitably embarrassed handling
them. And then there's Christopher McDonald, who has the capacity to be
a fun, exciting actor. McDonald's charisma is totally diminished here as
he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role (yes, Pogue makes
it a hat-trick). I pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise
for all these actors.
The young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better. Let's
cut the talented Canadian lad Joshua Jackson some slack for maintaining
believability within the confines of his character. Paul Walker, the
strapping quarterback from `Varsity Blues', is bland but passable as
Caleb Mandrake - the Judge's son. Walker preserves a straight face, even
when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie (`Dad, I just killed a guy
in the ritual room!'). Some actual spark is generated by Leslie Bibb,
who plays Luke's longtime chum Chloe, and manages to successfully pull
off some convincing dramatics. It really boils down to the actors
attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that
cages them from minute one. Or maybe not minute one, thanks to a decent
set-up from director Rob Cohen, who films early sequences with a sense
of atmosphere and style. It makes you wonder why he didn't flee
indefinitely from the project, because while enjoyable cheese like
`Dragonheart' and the moderate Stallone thriller `Daylight' aren't
superior cinema, they belong on the AFI Top 100 list when compared to
this degrading trash.
Aside from unintentionally humoring the audience, `The Skulls' gets
little accomplished. The thrills and action are lazy and mechanical. The
story is stuffed with ridiculous, formulaic plotting that sheepishly
overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick.
Instead of gaining knowledge about The Skulls as an organization, we are
thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed
barnacles from excessive usage. We've seen it all before, and better.
`The Skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity, so miscalculated
that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like boneheaded'
seems just too generous.

_The_Skulls_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
I'll cut to the chase for the teenybopper admirers of _Dawson's_Creek_
heartthrob Joshua Jackson: he has a couple of partial shirtless shots and
a big scene where he runs around in a skintight spandex rowing outfit. 
But as loud as the girls' howls were for that latter scene, they did not
compare to the ever-increasing volume of the ones from the entire
audience as this atrocious thriller grew longer and more ridiculous. 
Jackson plays Luke, a student at an Ivy League university who is
recruited to join the exclusive "secret" on-campus society known as (what
else?) the Skulls.  (I place the word "secret" in quotes because everyone
is not only acutely aware of the society's existence, but also the
location of their headquarters.)  He joins and enjoys the perks of
membership until he learns of the despicable Skulls cover-up of an even
more despicable crime.  Luke wants out, but the organization, of course,
has other ideas.
One big problem with the film from the start: I never understood why
being a Skull was so special in the first place.  While there are obvious
monetary benefits, the other "special" activities--black tie parties,
free sex, vacation retreats--would be commonplace for other
non-underground groups.  That, however, is a minor complaint, for
_The_Skulls_ is one of those bad films that manages to get worse and
worse across the board as it progresses.  Barely credible performances
turn embarrassingly amateurish (token female Leslie Bibb is cute, but
that doesn't count for anything when the material gets more, ahem,
"serious"); the turns of the plot are not so much shocking as laughably
preposterous (the gratuitous Jackson/Bibb love scene comes at the most
unconvincing moment possible; and nothing can prepare you for the, for
lack of a better term, "Victorian" climax).  After seeing _The_Skulls_
and Rob Cohen's last two theatrical releases, _Daylight_ and
_Dragonheart_, I am forced to wonder if he actually did direct the
memorable _Dragon:_The_Bruce_Lee_Story_.

Sometime in the next week I'll get eMail from some outraged teen who
will call me an idiot and tell me that The Skulls was the best movie
ever made. To which I'll reply "Were you drunk when you saw it?"
(usually the answer is "yes" and I know this because the kidlets
inevitably spills the beans in the last line of the eMail) and "Did you
laugh at what you were seeing happen on the screen?" (which, if there
was even one person in that audience anything like the multitude I sat
with here in New York City, the answer is also "yes"). Net response:
look up the word "Ludicrous" in your Funk and Wagnall's and you'll
probably see, as definition 6: "as in a movie: ie. The Skulls" If ever
there was a movie that enabled its audience to feel inherently superior
to the alleged upper-classes seen in its scenario -- and that smug sense
of superiority is the key to laughing at, and thus enjoying, this flick
-- it is this one.
The idea of it all -- that a centuries old college secret society has
tendrils into the highest and lowest corridors of power in the country
-- is so fit for the conspirati madness that has gripped our country
ever since JFK got his head popped that I thought, "OK let's see where
it goes."
It went down pretty quickly. From the very first second of the flick,
after an ominous chord of music and a title card informing us of some
background material the audience I sat with was in stitches. We are
introduced to Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), a poor boy hoping that
he'll be tapped for The Skulls because he's heard that they'll cover the
ridiculous cost of the legal career he hopes to pursue. He's got a hot,
upperclass girl friend, Chloe Whitfeld (Leslie Bibb) and a journalism
major roommate, Will Beckford (Hill Harper), who is secretly trying to
do an expose on the secret societies that infest the campus (which is
Yale, though that word is never spoken in the flick).
Luke gets tapped, of course. Thus begins an elaborate ritual of
introduction to the group, called the Revelation process. Luke is
attached to a "soul mate," Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), to whom all
secrets must be revealed, and swiftly gets sucked into the world of The
Skulls, who provide money, cars, clothing, connections and even women
for the candidate's bed.
Then, the roommate commits suicide. The police detective (Steve Harris)
says it wasn't. Luke finds secret Skulls material belonging to "soul
mate" Caleb among Will's effects. Is it possible that The Skulls have
orchestrated a murder coverup to protect their own? And what would they
do to one of their own, if he spills the beans? Add to the mix a subplot
of a battle for control of The Skulls involving Caleb's father Judge
Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) and U.S. Senator Ames Levritt (William
Petersen), with Luke and friends stuck in the middle. The whole thing is
so lightweight ridiculous, filled with manipulative would be thrills,
that it is to laugh. Which half the audience did. To be fair, a good
hunk cheered at parts of this nonsense, but not I.
There are flat out stinkers and then there are the flicks that are so
bad that they're deserving of the purchase of the super-extra-large tub
o' popcorn with extra golden flavored topping to go with that bottle you
snuck into the theater, which pretty much sums up The Skulls. One day
you'll be sitting through this thing at a midnight show. The Skulls is
so bad that someone will proclaim it to be good.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Skulls, he would have paid...
And God bless the audience member who walked out saying "It's Eyes Wide
Shut all over again. This was terrible," while another walked out saying
"This wasn't even worth renting." Cranky says maybe it'll be fun if you
get a friend to pay for the rental and get incredibly drunk before you
sit through the tape. That way you point at your pal afterwards and yell
SUCKER! and cackle some more.

     A secret society so powerful it can get away with murder.  A secret
society so exclusive it firebrands everyone who joins with its mark.  A
secret society so secret... it has a big logo up on top of the
building!?
     You know something is rotten with THE SKULLS right from the
get-go.  I mean, what self-respecting prep school-Ivy League snob would
join an organization with a name as stupid as "The Skulls"?  Well, Luke
(Joshua Jackson) would be, for one.  Only he's no preppie.  He's a
"townie" with no money, but even though he's of the Lower Classes, since
he's such a good rower (yes, "the skulls," I get it), he's a shoo-in for
the secret society.  A mysterious invitation arrives, and Luke is
whisked into a world of power and money, where men in red robes usher in
beautiful women for the taking at tuxedoed parties.  Before you can
utter "Fidelio," Luke has become One of Them.
     Luke is soon partnered with a "soul mate" (not making that up),
Caleb Mandrake (MEET THE DEEDLES' Paul Walker) with whom he is supposed
to keep no secrets.  But uh-oh! when Luke's roommate gets jealous and
threatens to expose the entire society when he steals Caleb's key to the
secret chambers (remember, that big skull on the roof points the way
in).
     A cover-up ensues and Luke romances "Popular" star Leslie Bibb, and
then come a grand series of plot twists so asinine you'll want to join
in with the laughter and mockery of the audience if only doing so didn't
make this movie even worse.  Its desperate earnestness makes it even
more laughable (with none other than Craig T. "Coach" Nelson lording
over it all), and by the time 45 minutes are up, you'll probably be
ready to leave.  I know I was.
     Unfortunately, teens don't read movie reviews, so this critique
will likely be lost on anyone who cares.  Would that they would put
their collective foot down.  The last thing we need is another bad movie
that simply serves as an excuse to sell a soundtrack.

Rob Cohen's "The Skulls" is a handsomely produced disaster of a movie, filled 
with such ludicrous plotting and inconsistencies that it has to be seen to be 
believed. At least when Universal Pictures hired Shane Hurlbut as the 
cinematographer, they got their money's worth, which is more than can be said 
about virtually everyone and everything else involved in the making of this 
"thriller," a so-called "'The Firm' for teens." The problem is that that 1993 
Tom Cruise-starrer was also a dumbed-down version of a John Grisham novel. 
Drop its IQ down yet another 50 points, transform its characters into college 
students, and what you are left with is "The Skulls."
Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) is a former street kid whose key to being 
accepted at the prestigious Yale University is his expertise on the college's 
famed rowing team. Planning to go to law school after graduation, he is 
unsure of how he is going to manage it, considering he has twenty bucks in 
the bank, considerably less than the annual $45,000 tuition fee. Lurking 
about the campus is a much-talked-about secret society called The Skulls (if 
it is such a secret, how come everyone knows about it?), to which we are 
informed at the on-set that at least two of the United States' presidents 
have been members. Once initiated, there is no exempting, but The Skulls 
promise inductees unlimited amounts of wealth and fortune, as well as a few 
trophy women to go along with it. 
Despite the warnings of Luke's two best friends, Will (Hill Harper) and Chloe 
(Leslie Bibb), he is chosen to join The Skulls, and without hesitation, 
accepts. A pair of new members are chosen to be soul mates, and Luke is 
partnered with Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), whose father, Judge Litten 
Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), coincidentally, is the head of the society. Luke 
is overjoyed to later discover that $20,000 has been added to his bank 
account, but being a member of The Skulls means inevitably slighting Will and 
Chloe, whom he is secretly in love with. Then an apparent suicide of someone 
close to Luke occurs on campus, but evidence points to foul play, and it 
becomes believed that the victim was murdered. All suspicions of Luke point 
to The Skulls being involved in a cover-up scheme.
What can be said about "The Skulls" other than it's one of the most 
unintentionally silly movies so far this year, not to mention one of the 
worst? The screenplay, by John Pogue, is a real howler, and should never have 
been given the chance to see the light of day. In one scene, a female 
character is chased across campus in broad daylight, which conveniently 
appears to be deserted. In another, Luke is drugged to an almost catatonic 
state, to the point where saliva is uncontrollably dribbling out the side of 
his mouth. Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, he jumps right into a 
conversation as if nothing had happened. Was he just playing an April Fool's 
joke on everyone, and decided it would be funny to pretend he was a human 
vegetable? And who could forget the laughable duel climax, complete with real 
guns, that takes place in what looked like the courtyard of the school?
The dialogue is no better, with one distressingly stilted scene in which 
Luke, Will, and Chloe discuss the history of The Skulls, reciting dialogue 
that not for a second seems natural, but simply an excuse to relay to the 
audience some background information. "The Skulls" might have at least been 
funny had director Rob Cohen (who made the far superior 1996 action film, 
"Daylight") and screenwriter Pogue let the audience know that it was meant as 
a comedy. To my dismay, however, it appears like the movie is very well 
attempting to be a serious-minded thriller. 
"The Skulls" marks the debut of Joshua Jackson (TV's "Dawson's Creek") in a 
lead film role, after supporting parts in 1998's "Urban Legend" and 1999's 
"Cruel Intentions," and it's unfortunate that he had to choose such an 
unusually bad movie to take that next step in his career. All other actors 
are handed throwaway roles, except for Paul Walker (1998's "Pleasantville"), 
who makes next to no impression, and Leslie Bibb (TV's "Popular"), who is the 
only one in the cast who projects even the slightest hint of intelligence. 
Bibb has a bright screen presence, but she is surrounded by such inanity that 
all she can do is struggle to come away from the wreckage unscathed (she 
succeeds, for the most part).
Worst of all, when "The Skulls" isn't downright awful, it's just a chore to 
sit through. Dull and oddly outdated, only the lush photography by Hurlbut, 
accentuating its gorgeous Toronto-based setting, saves the picture from being 
a surefire cure for insomniacs. On second thought, maybe Universal should 
have hired someone less accomplished to work as cinematographer. That way, 
when viewers would fall into a deep slumber for its duration, it would cause 
them to forget that such an absurd motion picture was actually ever committed 
to celluloid. It would also save the actors from any further embarrassment.

I'd be hard-pressed to name a movie more average than "The Skulls".=20
Scripting, acting, direction -- none of them are bad, exactly, but none=20
of them manage to impress much, either. This is the sort of movie where,
if you're paying any sort of attention, you can easily predict the plot
twists (to use the term loosely) before the first five minutes are up...
and probably come up with better ones, too. "The Skulls" is utterly
lacking in spark or invention, barely enjoyable as a mindless popcorn
movie.
"The Skulls" is inspired by Skull and Bones, a real Yale "secret" society.
This movie, too, takes place at Yale, though in one of several bizarre
decisions by screenwriter John Pogue, the university is never named --
despite the abundance of the letter 'Y', the name of the school sports
team, and other signs which should make the setting obvious. Luke McNamara
(Joshua Jackson) is a "townie" who has built himself up from meagre roots.
Now he's a scholarship student and the star of the school rowing team, and
has attracted the attention of the Skulls.
Inducted into the secret society, Luke is paired with Caleb Mandrake=20
(Paul Walker); the two become "soulmates", intended to watch each other's=
=20
back. Caleb's father, Supreme Court hopeful Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T
Nelson) is the chairman of the Skulls, but their relationship is strained
over Caleb's indecision about his future. At first, life as a Skull seems
grand: Luke is given money, a car, women. But his newfound status -- and
the all-pervasive secrecy of the Skulls -- begins to cause tension between
him and his best friends Will (Hill Harper) and Chloe (Leslie Bibb).
To make matters worse, Will is covertly working on an expose of the=20
Skulls. This leads to a confrontation with Caleb and Will's death, which
the Skulls make to look like a suicide. Luke decides to betray his
benefactors and tell the police what he knows, but soon discovers that the
Skulls' power truly is as far-reaching as they claim.
Despite starting from a promising premise, the script for "The Skulls"=20
leaves much to be desired. Having come up with the basis for the movie, it
appears Pogue was content to write the rest of it with his brain stuck in
neutral. Usually, a conspiracy film at least hands its audience a few
unexpected twists to keep the suspense high, but even that is lacking
here. There is a feeling of inevitability surrounding the proceedings, an
unfortunate sense that we've seen all this before -- and often done=20
better.
But the movie's biggest problem is its conception of the Skulls itself.
Although they are obviously supposed to appear powerful and fearsome
(right from the start, we're told three Presidents have been Skulls and
the CIA owes its origins to them), the members instead come across as a
bunch of squabbling, scheming incompetents. I find it difficult to believe
that a society could remain so secret and so successful for two centuries
with its membership stabbing one another in the back at every opportunity.
But wait, there's another problem: just how "secret" are the Skulls
anyhow? Everyone on campus has heard of them, which isn't surprising given
that they advertise with a bloody great symbol on the roof of their
building. The night they induct new recruits is common knowledge, and each
member has a skull branded into his arm for all to see. (The movie
dubiously has the recruits don wristwatches afterward, as if this will
cover up the brand forevermore.) Their videotape records are cleverly
hidden in a secret room behind a bookcase in the campus library, accessed
by moving a certain book. This would be a foolproof scheme, I guess, if it
hadn't also appeared in about two hundred episodes of "Scooby Doo". Even
the Skulls' attempt to cover up Will's death are hamfisted. He has smacked
his head off the floor, so they make it look as if he hanged himself;
wouldn't it be a lot more convincing to just throw him off a building?
One good thing about "The Skulls" is that, in addition to main star
Jackson, a very good, action-oriented role is provided for Bibb as well.=20
To feature a woman who isn't entirely helpless is a rarity enough for the
genre; to feature one whose deeds are so pivotal to the outcome is unusual
indeed. Although wooden in places, Bibb does a capable job in a=20
commendable role, and it is only unfortunate that her contribution does
not extend to the movie's lackluster climax.
Jackson, although not a prototypical action hero in appearance, isn't bad
here either. He does a good job of portraying Luke as a man torn between
two worlds: not just between the Skulls and his friends, but between his
"misspent youth" and current Ivy League life as well. Sadly, his and
Bibb's chemistry leaves something to be desired; a sex scene, for example,
feels token and unnatural.
The rest of the cast is less impressive. Walker is given a lot of
potential as Caleb, but doesn't really run with it, turning in a
performance that is passable at best. Harper is vapid, albeit in a
transparently scripted, purely functional role. William Petersen, as
Senator Ames Levritt (who may or may not be Luke's only ally in the
Skulls) appears to be doing his best Bill Clinton impersonation
throughout. And Craig T Nelson is hard to take seriously in a dull and
cliched part, especially given that he seems to have borrowed Patrick
Stewart's mustache from "Masterminds".
Given that it boasts an intriguing premise and a couple of good young
castmembers, "The Skulls" could have been much better. As it is, this is a
mostly forgettable exercise in the paucity of the creative process. The
teenage market, at which this film is obviously aimed, has endured movies
much worse than this one. But it deserves better than "The Skulls", too.
