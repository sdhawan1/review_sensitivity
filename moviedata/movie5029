     Would that simple words could describe the goings-on of COOL CRIME,
an indie black comedy reminiscent of BLUE VELVET.
     In base terms, the story follows an Italian immigrant named Nino
(Ackert), who comes to America to live in L.A. with his uncle.  Sadly,
upon arrival, uncle (who turns out to be a drug dealer) is dead.  But
things get really strange when the spirit of the dead uncle comes to
visit Nino, pleading for revenge.
     That's only the beginning, and patient viewers will no doubt be
rewarded by director Cohen-Olivar's nuanced work.  I'm not that patient
a person, so COOL CRIME's more mellow moments tended to drag me down. 
But many of the Tarantino fueled scenes and outrageous characters have
their moments, even if the film, as a whole, is uneven.
     Ultimately and unfortunately, I saw the "surprise" ending coming,
but I suspect most people reading this review don't have the
hyperintelligence that I do, so you'll probably sit up in your seat. 
Suffice it to say that this is a picture that could only take place in
L.A.
