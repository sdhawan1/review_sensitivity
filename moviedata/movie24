Billy Wilder's "The Apartment" was an enormous
success.  Nominated for ten Academy Awards, it won
five, including Best Picture and Best Director.
Made as a comedy, the film appears much darker
today. However, the stereotype of business executives
as cynical, manipulative skirt-chasers strains
credibility, and the actions of characters both
major and minor is entirely predictable.
Jack Lemmon works long hours in an enormous
office.  It turns out that he stays late because
he can't go home: he has allowed his corporate
bosses to borrow his apartment for sessions with
their mistresses.  Lemmon is hoping for a promotion,
which he finally obtains when he grants company
bigshot Fred MacMurray exclusive access.
Meanwhile, Lemmon is attracted to winsome elevator
operator Shirley MacLaine.  His progress with her
is limited, as she is MacMurray's mistress.  When
Lemmon discovers her secret, what will he do?
This being a movie, he tells his boss off, walks
away from his cushy job, and walks off into the
sunset with his willing love interest.  We are
awaiting the sequel, which assumedly begins with
Lemmon and MacLaine standing in the unemployment line.
Many scenes in "The Apartment" don't quite work.
Why do these executives go to such trouble to use
Lemmon's apartment, when they could get one of their
own, or rent a hotel?  MacMurray and his fellow
bosses are excessively crass, and the office party
is so wild that one expects the riot squad to show up.
Lemmon's personality change from toadying underling
to "mensch" is sudden yet predictable.  MacLaine's
hot-headed brother-in-law is an unfunny plot device
to gain audience sympathy for chivalric Lemmon.
