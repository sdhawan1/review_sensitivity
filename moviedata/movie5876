MAN WITHOUT A STAR (1955)  Directed by King Vidor. Written by Borden Chase
and D.D. Beauchamp from the novel by Dee Linford. Photography, Russell
Metty. Editing,Virgil W. Vogel. Art, Alexander Golitzen, Richard H. Reidel.
Music, Joseph Gershenson.  Cast: Kirk Douglas, Jeanne Crain, Claire Trevor,
William Campbell et al. 90 minutes.
King Vidor was a major figure who even in his lesser films invariably had
very fine moments, mostly of stress. These were photographed with powerful
use of camera angles, swooping shots, and imaginative juxtaposition of
sight and sound.  "Man Without a Star" is a case in point, and though not
at the top of the Western-filled 1950s (a period that tried to bring new
depth and scope to the genre), it does a most creditable job of a fairly
familiar situation.
Easygoing rider Dempsey Rae ( Kirk Douglas), an ambulant cowboy, takes a
greenhorn kid (Campbell) under his tutelage, to his (Dempsey's) future but
only temporary sorrow. He gets involved in a war between Open Spacers and
Barbed Wirers.  He hates the wire which "is catching up with me again."
The movie is uneven, has contrived parts, prettified situations, and one of
those awful 1950s openings where balladeers or crooners (in this case
Frankie Laine)  sing awfully, miserable  songs with miserable lyrics.
The barbed-wire, don't fence-me-in  symbolism  is heavy-footed.  But there
are many gratifying aspects:  much convoluted, tense and  tight action with
original twists and moments  The camera work is beautiful. Director of
photography. Russell Metty did three fils for Orson Welles: "The
Magnificent Ambersons,"(with two other cinematographers), the visually
amazing "Touch of Evil, " and "The Stranger." Some of his other credits
include Howard Hawks' "Bringing Up Baby," John Huston's "The Misfits," and
"Spartacus" for which Metty was awarded an Oscar.
As for Kirk Douglas, his part and performance are variants of something he
can do blindfolded, the role of the champion who won't bend.
Jeanne Crain, the female lead, was primarily a sweet thing or a pretty
ingenue. Her filmography is a mixed bag, her roles were on the thin side
--with one outstanding exception:  in Elia Kazan's "Pinky," a sensitive,
gripping, courageous and pioneering drama released in1949.  Crain  played
Pinky, a very light-skinned black girl who passes for white. Otherwise, in
much of her work I find beautiful Jeanne seldom fully convincing or
interesting.
In "Man Without a Star" her unexpected casting  as an opportunist -- even
her first name, Reed, is masculine -- is original  and works out rather
well.  The supporting cast includes such  reliable character actors  as
Richard Boone, Jack Elam and Jay C. Flippen. Other female parts went to the
excellent, earthy Claire Trevor and to the exotically named Mara Corday.
The latter  worked almost exclusively in B-films, (to put it charitably,
since many were C-pictures)  In "Man" her performance may or may not be
notable, but the movie itself was the best she ever appeared in. (Edwin
