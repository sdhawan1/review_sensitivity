SYNOPSIS:  The film follows the adventures of Axel (Johnny Depp), a
young man living in New York happy with his job of counting and tagging
fish for the NY Fisheries service who believes that by gazing into the
eyes of the fish they can share their dreams with him and they, his.
He returns to the small Arizona town of his childhood for the occasion
of his Cadillac selling Uncle Leo's (Jerry Lewis) wedding to Millie
(Paulina Porizkova).  Soon afterward he becomes amorously entangled
with a beautiful Elaine (Faye Dunaway), flying enthusiast, and her
daughter Grace (Lilli Taylor), accordion player and mining tycoon.  The
drama proceeds along the theme of competition between Elaine and Grace
for Axel's affections (a la MRS ROBINSON).
COMMENTS:  The delight in the film arose for me, out of its spectacular
surreal and absurdist imagery, e.g., a fish flying down the main street
and the clever use of a balloon in transition from a dream sequence
into "reality."  There is an extraordinary scene where a tree is set
aflame by lightning in the pouring rain next to a house decorated with
lights.  Some of the scenes of conflict between Elaine, Grace and Axel
were somewhat of a test of emotional endurance.  I must admit to having
been particularly struck by Lilli Taylor who reminded me a lot of
Lauren Bacall.
     In terms of comparisons with other films: BLISS is the closest
contemporary film I have seen which resembles it; Wim Wender's PARIS
TEXIS is another illustration of a European director set in against a
backdrop of American urban wilderness.  There are entertaining
quotations/excerpts from NORTH BY NORTHWEST, RAGING BULL, and THE
GODFATHER in the film.  There is a reference to the script of THE
WIZARD OF OZ in the credits which I must have missed during the film.
