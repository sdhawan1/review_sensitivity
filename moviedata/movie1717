You're a single father, and your 9-year-old son wants to go to a camp in
the woods with a group called the Discoverer Troops.  The problem is
that the group may be something akin to the Hitler Youth.  The group is
associated with your neighbor, whom you have good reason to suspect is
an anti-government terrorist and who is in town to bomb a large building
full of innocent victims.  His son will accompany yours on the trip.
Sure, because you want him to think that you're a swell father.  After
all, you're not absolutely positive that your neighbor is a mass
murderer about to strike again.
This is one of many such predicaments that confront poor Michael Faraday
(Jeff Bridges).  And its implausible resolution is one of many that the
audience has to swallow.  Better buy a large soda for this movie since
you're going to be asked to swallow a lot.
Oh, did I mention that Michael is not some naďve citizen but is an
expert on terrorist activities?  He even teaches a course about them at
George Washington University.
Actually, the movie's most serious flaws are the twists and surprise
coincidences that don't seem too ridiculous until you think about them
after the movie.  It is only then that you realize that in order for
them to work, a series of almost random events have to happen in just
the right time and sequence, like a gambler who bets he can draw to a
dozen inside straights in a row.
It is a shame that writer Ehren Kruger felt compelled to make the plot
so obvious.  Whenever he introduces any ambiguity, he feels obligated to
resolve it in the next scene.  As an outline, the movie works.  But the
devil is in the details.  And the devil in these details is way too easy
to spot.
Although the script is full of holes and Mark Pellington's direction is
too often lethargic, some superlative acting almost saves the picture.
With suave and seductive charm, Tim Robbins plays the
is-he-evil-incarnate-or-isn't-he neighbor, Oliver Lang.  Oliver appears
to be a reserved and compassionate man, who is as pure as the driven
snow.  With sweetness and delicacy, Robbins steals scene after scene.
With a less obvious script and a subtler director, Robbins's brilliant
work could have made this picture shine.
Jeff Bridges gives a convincing and sincere performance as the haggard
father caught in the whirlwind.  His proclivity to punctuate sentences
with needless pauses can be frustrating, but, in his defense, perhaps it
makes it more natural as well.
On the other hand, Hope Davis, as Michael's girlfriend, Brooke Wolfe, is
almost too smart for the part.  She plays a character who laughs off
plausible warnings for too long.  You have to be pretty stupid to ignore
the facts presented to her, and both Davis and her character are just
too intelligent to be believe that they would be that foolish.
As Oliver's wife, Cheryl, Joan Cusack was cast, one would suppose, to
give the deadly serious thriller a comedic touch.  Nothing she does is
funny, leaving her seeming like a fish out of water.  She manages to
maintain the same fake, frozen smile throughout the entire movie.
The movie opens with Oliver's son standing in the street with blood
dripping from what appears to be a hand partially blown away.  He claims
that he was just playing with fireworks -- in the middle of March, no
less.  Why don't writers give audiences credit for more intelligence?
Why do they feel they have to telegraph every punch?
The movie does end with a dramatic and almost satisfying twist.  But
before you get too impressed, think about it for a minute.  The ending
manages to destroy not only the last part of the picture, it also makes
suspect many of the seemingly more rational parts of the rest of the
movie.
Check your brains at the door.  Keep your eyes on Tim Robbins.  And
maybe you'll be able to overlook the film's flaws.  Robbins gives the
picture more than it deserves.  His performance almost makes the movie
worth recommending.
ARLINGTON ROAD runs 1:57.  It is rated R for violence and some profanity
and would be acceptable for teenagers.

In the days before television and air-conditioning neighbors got to know
each other as they sat on their porches getting a breath of fresh air. 
Families kept their eyes open and made sure that all the children behaved.
At first, you might feel that such a relationship is forming in Arlington
Road.  But, things aren't as they seem.   
I've seen this film twice and I'm still making deductions about what
really happened.  The first screening was several months ago, when no hint
about the plot was known.  The movie literally blew me away.  I wanted to
see it again, but the release date kept being postponed.  Eight months
later, when there was another screening, I looked for scenes that would
explain what I remembered.  Many critics are simply dismissing the plot as
too contrivedthat it couldn't happen.  I don't agree.  The writing is
very good, and the subtleties are woven well into the dialogue.  I'm still
thinking about certain scenes.  It has certainly made me look at things
differently.
The story centers on Michael Farraday (Bridges) whose wife, an FBI agent,
was killed two years previously in a botched raid on terrorists.  Now, in
his college classes his frustrations about her death reflect in his
teachings.  His relationship with a former student Brooke Wolfe, (Davis)
is somewhat strained, partly because his son, Grant (Clark) cannot accept
her presence in the family unit. 
One day Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins and Cusack) `happen' to move into
his neighborhood, or is this accidental?  Farrady begins to question who
they are and why they are there. He feels that Oliver is hiding things and
that his work as an engineer is a cover-up.  He calls upon his wife's
former partner Whit Carver (Gossett) for assistance in delving into Lang's
past.  Is it paranoia or are his suspicions real?  
Although you will probably guess what happens, the ending will still make
you thinka lotafter you leave the theater.  That makes it worth seeing. 
I give it a very strong B+, because I definitely wanted to see it again,
and I'm glad I did.

Arlington Road by DeWyNGaLe (John Sylva)    Rating: A-

Arlington Road is a relieving summer film, as we get away from special effects
extravaganzas, into a spellbinding film marvelously crafted by director Mark
Pellington and first time screenwriter, Ehren Kruger.  Arlington Road's clever
script features many horrifying, tense sequences in which the viewer is brought
into the film, and in result, fear their own neighbors, friends, and possibly
even family.  Ehren Kruger takes a chance with his non Hollywood script, which
includes a depressing ending that is impossible to see coming.   
Arlington Road's concept deals with Washington State University terrorism
professor, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who suffered the loss of his F.B.I.
agent wife in a shootout, and lives with son Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) and
occasionally girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis) on the quiet, peaceful street that
is Arlington Road.  In Arlington Road's well-photographed opening sequence,
Michael Faraday saves the young Brady Lang, whom he finds in the middle of the
street wounded terribly.  After rescuing Brady, Michael is introduced to his
parents, who live just across the street, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl (Joan
Cusack) Lang.  The pleasant neighbors have kept to themselves for their time
living there, but quickly become friends with Michael and Brooke.  Clues lead
up to Michael believing his Brady Bunch type neighbors are actually terrorists,
and learns that Oliver has a terrorist past, and is ready to strike again.
The screenplay feeds Jeff Bridges an array of conflict to handle, as Faraday
constantly conflicts between his deceased wife and girlfriend Brooke, his
neighbors who are turning his life into a 24-hour scare, and must decipher what
is happening in his life, whether his terrorism college course is getting to
his head, whether to look past his wife, and look at Brooke, and how to handle
the situation across the street.  Jeff Bridges handles all tasks well in deed,
as he exhibits a performance which is both applaudable and unwatchable, as his
facial expressions are so tense, they become hideous.  Bridges rehearses every
line and every move with a certain amount of tenseness, which helps create the
well-written character's fear of Oliver and Cheryl, as he is the only one who
knows that he has stumbled upon something big. 
Hope Davis gives a shockingly down to earth performance, and fits her
character's shoes well, as she must deal with her paranoid boyfriend, while all
she wants to do is lead a happy life.  Hints of Brooke giving in to Michael's
beliefs come frequently, but the apparent gut feeling never comes out of her,
until she discovers the truth for herself.  
Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins are particularly eerie as the picture perfect
neighbors, which turn out to be not so perfect in the end.  Cusack gets to show
off the darker side of her acting skills as a character that is common in
everyone's everyday lives, therefore the scariness of her character seems
realistic, and will you make you question your own neighbors.  Cusack is
horrifying as Cheryl Lang, as every smile, every move, and every word from her
are chilling, as she seems to be Miss Goody-Goody to everyone, but the viewers
know the devastating truth.   Tim Robbins isn't given much to do as the main
antagonist, but does what he can, delivering an utterly horrifying performance.
 Oliver's past isn't developed well, and is explained by Oliver to Michael in a
frightening scene, where Oliver reveals his motives.  Oliver's motive just adds
to the tension between himself and Michael, and doesn't seem out of place, as 
many horror films have demonstrated motive sequences which seem strange, as the
killers have a perfect chance to dispose of their victim, but go on about their
past, as the victim slowly devises a plan to defend themselves.  Arlington
Road's motive sequence is something realistic, that a person would actually do,
to darken the protagonist's world more than they already have. 
Ehren Kruger's screenplay stays true to the key plot of the film, but also
contains an abundance of subplots, which all contribute to the overall
greatness of the film.  Each character is a three dimensional, realistic person
with distinctive thoughts and personalities, that aren't your regular movie
characters, which usually don't act like people do, as in last spring's Analyze
This, where the characters were anything but human.
Even now, days after viewing this film, I feel fear deep within, as I glance
over my shoulder every few seconds, just for that extra ounce of security that
I lost while viewing Arlington Road. The screenplay does what I like best, save
the good part for last, as the entire ending 45 minutes are particularly
unsettling, as Michael's suspicions become reality, and the film gets down to
the real nitty-gritty.  The disturbing score, the edgy script, the terrific
ensemble cast, and original directing all contribute to make this wonderful
presentation of pure, raw terror.
The Bottom Line- Arlington Road was supposed to hit theaters in May, but due to
the tragic Columbine High School shootings, the film was delayed. The tagline
for last spring's film Never Been Kissed best sums up my thoughts with the
line-- "Some things are worth waiting for."

The threat of terrorism is as alive as one can imagine. From the recent
tragedies at Ruby Ridge and Oklahoma to the World Trade Center bombings,
terrorism hangs like a pall of death in our everyday existence. "Arlington
Road" makes claim that terrorists may be our own next-door neighbors, ready to
pounce at any given moment. 
Jeff Bridges stars as a professor of terrorism at George Washington University
who teaches his students that the perpetrators of terrorism are wrongly
personified by the media - they are not acts done by one man but by a group. He
is obsessed by the mere act of terrorism itself, mainly due to his late wife,
an FBI agent, who died at the hands of terrorists. Bridges also thinks that his
next-door neighbor (Tim Robbins with a steely stare) may be a terrorist. At the
beginning of the film, Bridges rescues a child in the streets (played by Mason
Gamble), who is bleeding profusely from what appears to be a firecracker
accident. The child belongs to Robbins and his wife, played by Joan Cusack. 
"Arlington Road" is a strange, sometimes effective film that begins as a
character study and quickly becomes an all too fast-paced thriller dependent on
far too many implausibilities. Once the shocking ending comes into play, we
rethink how the terrorist group managed to fulfill their actions and it becomes
all too neat and tidy to have any credence. 
Jeff Bridges, one of our most unsung and underappreciated actors, gives a fine,
empathetic performance and he gives us a complex view of a man at war with his
inner anxieties who can't separate the obsession from his personal life. It is
Tim Robbins who overacts, simply staring like a wild-eyed fool making offbeat
gestures that undermine any credibility or understanding - what does his
character stand for when he commits these atrocious acts? What is he rebelling
against? At times, Robbins seems to have drifted in from a cartoon. It doesn't
help that his kids appear like aliens from "Village of the Damned." 
The female actors are not any better and are vastly underused. Joan Cusack
appears more suited to a demented "Addams Family" role than the one given here
- her close-ups hinder rather than help. And I am not a big fan of Hope Davis,
who nearly ruined the often funny "The Daytrippers" with her blandness and
forced smile. Here she has not improved much playing a bland housewife with a
forced smile. 
"Arlington Road" has its moments of suspense and tension but not enough to
overcome a wholly implausible scenario dependent on contrivance rather than
plot coherence. The dark ending gives it some weight, but it all rings very
hollow. At the end of the road lies an exploitative and shallowly misconceived
dead end.

"Arlington Road" is an interesting thriller that lost its core
audience because of poor marketing. The film was supposed to have been
released in April after a teaser trailer would tell little but promise
a lot. However, this was not the case. The film's trailer gave away
many secret plot twists and basically told the entire story. Then, the
film's release date got pushed back to July 9th when the filmmakers
decided that they didnt want the touchy subject matter to coincide
with the aftermath of the recent school shootings.
That being said, "Arlington Road" is a movie starring Jeff Bridges as
Michael Faraday, a terrorism expert whose wife was killed in a
Waco-like shootout. He meets his new neighbors, Oliver(Tim Robbins)
and Cheryl(Joan Cusack) Lang, when he rescues their son after he is
wounded while using fireworks. Michael and his girlfriend, Brooke(Hope
Davis), befriend their neighbors while their kids bond
together. However, Michael starts to notice some very disturbing
things about the man next door. Is he just imagining these
things(because of his terrorism-laced mind) or are they real? I will
not give away any more, because hopefully you haven't seen the film's
trailer and might be surprised.
Director Mark Pellington made the romantic-comedy "Going All The Way"
a couple years ago, and "Arlington Road" has an entirely different
filmmaking style. Despite a few formulaic plot contrivances,
"Arlington Road" is a cut above most suspense flicks. Jeff Bridges is
at his Lebowski-best, while Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are absolutely
haunting as the neighbors from hell.  The ending of the film is
devastating and very disturbing, as conventionality takes a backseat
to the sad, slightly warped version of the truth.

Starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope David, Joan Cusack. Rated R.
As I write this, nearly two days after the screening, Arlington Road is
still a haunting and vivid image in my memory. I suspect it will stay
with me for some time. Director Mark Pellington delivers one of the
scariest, smartest, most daring thrillers I've seen in recent memory, a
thoughtful yet horrifyingly intense meditation on human nature.
Jeff Bridges, who has shown his remarkable versatility as an actor with
his roles in The Big Lebowski and now this, stars as Michael Faraday, a
jittery man who teaches a class on terrorism at a local university. His
wife, an FBI agent, died a few years prior because the Bureau gave her
faulty information on a terrorist suspect. He now lives with his son
and, on occasion, his girlfriend (Hope Davis).
Across the street from them live five seemingly ordinary people: Oliver
and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, respectively) with their
three children. At first, Michael tries to be friendly, frequently
visiting and assuring that his kid interacts with theirs. But it isn't
long before he starts noticing strange things around their household:
suspicious blueprints, strange mail and other extraordinary goings-on.
Soon, Faraday launches a one man investigation into Oliver Lang's past,
finding out that he changed his name to the name of the person who died
the day before and that he was caught up in a pipe bomb incident at the
tender age of 16.
Faraday begins to suspect conspiracy while everyone around him is
convinced that he has gone off the deep end. With his extensive
knowledge of terrorism, he is determined to discover the secret behind
his peculiar neighbors. But is there anything to discover?
Arlington Road is a film about denial. We clamor for a sense of personal
security and when that is taken away from us we, as a people, are
willing to drastically mislead ourselves to get it back. This movie says
that there is no conspicuous end to our self-delusion. Those who dare to
stand up and argue that the conclusions we so deliberately come to are
wrong are immediately labeled paranoid, perhaps even crazy. In that
sense, this is a staggeringly brilliant cautionary tale.
Aside from that, it's also an insanely suspenseful thriller. With tour
de force cinematography, a stunningly effective (although fairly
standard) soundtrack and intriguing scene set-ups, Arlington Road
generated such pure, unadulterated tension that I must admit I was taken
aback. In the best Hitchcock tradition, here's a movie that not only
entertains and keeps you glued to the screen in the immediate present
but one that also carries enough weight to remain in your memory for a
significant amount of time after you throw away that empty popcorn
bucket.
Jeff Bridges gives a virtuoso performance as the desperate Faraday. He
is the perfect action hero: a character without a hint of pretension who
acts on instinct alone. Bridges plays Faraday as a despairing person and
succeeds in making him a sympathetic character. Tim Robbins, heretofore
underused in dramatic roles, is absolutely chilling as the ominous
neighbor while Joan Cusack as Robbins' wife continues to show us why she
is one of the most talented actresses in the business.
I will not reveal the ending, but I will say that it is the perfect
example of why I love going to the movies. It is exactly the kind of
daring, unapologetic conclusion that shows me that there are still
people in the mainstream movie business willing to go against popular
convention. Pellington and writer Ehren Kruger (the upcoming Scream 3)
saw an opportunity to solidify the film's point and went for it without
wimping out.
It's a shame that Arlington Road is destined to get lost in the shuffle
with all the big blockbusters because it is (so far) the year's best
film. Only the best of filmmakers and performers can make me so
completely suspend my disbelief and get me involved in the action and
the folks involved with this production did just that. A pessimistic
cautionary tale, this is a movie that has all the potential of a great
movie and, for once is able to realize it.

It depends on your basis of judgment whether or not you will enjoy
Arlington Road, a suspenseful but convoluted Hitchockian yarn about
neighborly suspicion. Critics and audiences tend to react different to
this sort of movie, but if you are able to grasp the basic premise with
depth and believability, you should enjoy yourself.
Arlington Road was first set for release in mid-January 99, when it was
re-scheduled for a May 14 opening. But, after the violent and tragic
high school shooting in Colorado, the movie was postponed yet again to
avoid conflict that could result from it's terrorist-associated
plotline. All the more so because Arlington Road deals with violence
that takes place in a friendly environment that could resemble home for
more than a few people. It seemed nearly impossible for a film with such
a complicated past to break through in the busy season of summer.
The film does have big Hollywood names to combat the typical summer
action fare. Jeff Bridges, looking rather frigid and tense, plays
Michael Faraday, a university professor who teaches a class in U.S.
terrorism. He has a nine-year old child he's raised since the passing of
his wife, an F.B.I. agent who was killed in the line of duty. In a tense
prologue, Faraday comes upon a boy on the street, injured and bleeding
as he hobbles along helplessly. After driving him to the hospital,
Faraday meets the boy's parents, the humble and reserved Oliver Lang
(Tim Robbins) and his eccentric but caring wife (Joan Cusack). It turns
out the Lang's live just across the street from Michael, and the two
families strike a bond.
But perhaps there is more to Mr. Lang than the friendly, overly-generous
facade that he puts on. Faraday, a man so paranoid he could put Agent
Mulder to shame, suspects something more of his neighbor. He starts
digging, digs some more, and then can't stop extracting clues from
Lang's mysterious past. After discovering a name-change and scanning
through the suspect's local paper, he comes upon the conclusion that
Oliver Lang is a sophisticated terrorist bomber. His current girlfriend
(Hope Davis) thinks he's a loon, but while his son plays with the Lang's
10-year old boy who enjoys lighting firecrackers, Faraday becomes more
overwrought with fear that something is not right.
To watch Arlington Road is to appreciate good acting. Bridges is
terrific; a bit too extraneous, but terrific. And while Robbins and
Cusack are both appropriately creepy,  I wanted so much more from their
characters, more exploration resulting in greater discovery. The latter,
in particular, is left fairly one-note. And Tim Robbins has such great
abilities, his character could have been stretched far beyond the limits
it's taken. Still, there's a certain chill that runs down your back when
he tells Bridges, `I didn't know you taught a course in terrorism.
That's a pretty frightening subject.' But good for a living too, I
suppose.
Most viewers will be biting their nails to the nubs as Arlington Road
nears the climax, but the suspense could have been greater. The script,
which starts out too dreary and slow, contains so many convoluted plot
details that a sense of unease sets in. Luckily, the action picks up and
the suspense goes into overdrive during the final twenty minutes,
leaving room for a very surprising and deviously clever finale. Some may
find it unnecessary, but I actually found more to like in it than I did
with the twisted 2 hours that preceded it. If Arlington Road had
maintained a steady intellectual pace to support this climax, than
perhaps there would have been more to relish in this entertaining but
passable summer popcorn movie.
Footnote: A good invitation for a neighborhood barbecue hosted by
Robbins' character would read: `BYOB: Bring Your Own Bomb'. Ha, ha.

Directed by Mark Pellington.
Cast: Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope Davis, Joan Cusack, Robert Gossett, 
Spencer Treat Clark, Mason Gamble.
1999 - 117 minutes
Rated R (for violence and profanity).
Reviewed July 10, 1999.
"Arlington Road," directed by Mark Pellington, is one of the most 
pulse-pounding paranoia thrillers I have seen, a horrifying, tautly-paced 
film dealing with a person who begins to suspect menacingly dark undertones 
in a seemingly joyous place. Although the theatrical trailer for the film 
unfairly gives away many of its secrets (shame on the studio, Screen Gems!), 
you might just be surprised about how unpredictable much of it remains, right 
up until merely moments before the developments occur. 
Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a grieving father of a 9-year-old son, 
Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), whose beloved wife, part of the feds, was killed 
in a case gone awry a year or two before. A professor for global terrorism, a 
subject he is truly and passionately intrigued and outraged by, at George 
Washington University, Michael has begun the process of repairing his 
broken-up life, and has gotten a nice girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), who 
cares for him but realizes she will never be able to measure up to his late 
wife. One day while driving home in his suburban neighborhood, Michael comes 
across a young boy (Mason Gamble) staggering along in the middle of the road, 
one of his arms severely charred up from a freak firecracker accident. 
Rushing him to the hospital, Michael is met with much gratitude from the 
boy's parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom 
Michael learns live right across the street from him. As Grant begins to come 
out of his shell when he becomes best friends with the Lang's son, Michael 
grows increasingly jealous and begins to suspect something fishy is going on 
when he finds Oliver's blueprints of an office building, when he says it is 
for a mall he is currently constructing. Due to the misfortune of his own 
wife, Michael isn't taking any chances, and soon has learned that Oliver 
Lang, which he changed his name to over fifteen years ago, was arrested for 
planting a bomb in a building when he was a teenager. To give away anymore 
would not be right, for there are many unexpected occurrences within the 
film's 117-minute running time that left me chilled right to the bone.
In its story arc, "Arlington Road" ultimately follows the tried-and-true, 
familiar pattern of many a thrillers. You know that the people around Michael 
will, at first, not buy into his serious suspicions, and that he will 
research the Lang's and discover more shocking secrets about them, and that 
there will be some sort of confrontation in the latter half. What you don't 
usually find in this type of thriller, however, is such a sympathetically 
written protagonist, and such a refreshingly high amount of energy that 
rarely ever lets up, as it leads you right to its devastating conclusion, 
which is such a decidedly downbeat but incalculable change of pace from the 
usual humdrum summer movies.
Thanks to the directing precision of Pellington (who fares much better here 
than in his previous film, 1997's "Going All the Way"); the tense, 
unequivocal screenplay by Ehren Krueger; the brooding cinematography by Bobby 
Bukowski, who really succeeds in portraying a supposedly peaceful suburban 
neighborhood in an obscure, threatening light; and the memorable, offbeat 
music score by David Lynch-regular Angelo Badalamenti, "Arlington Road" is an 
especially effective film that also turns out to be rather thought-provoking. 
In one of Faraday's college classes, he mentions that "people always want to 
blame one certain person just so that they can feel better," and this 
truthful statement looms eerily over the denouement. The characters of 
Michael and Brooke are also written intelligently enough so that when we 
realize that they are potentially being put into danger, their fates meant 
much more to me than the usual "thriller."
Jeff Bridges, a highly underrated actor who doesn't get as much notice as he 
should, probably because of some of his questionable film choices, is 
magnificent here, adding an appropriate mixture to his personality of love 
(for his son), depression (the death of his wife), and paranoia (of Oliver 
Lang). Bridges is asked to really push himself over the deep end in several 
scenes in his frustration to get others to realize what he firmly knows about 
the Lang's, and he is up to every challenge that comes his way.
Hope Davis, a remarkable, relatively new actress who has wowed me with the 
likes of the indie films, 1997's "The Daytippers" and "The Myth of 
Fingerprints," and 1998's "Next Stop Wonderland," is the film's performance 
standout. Her character of Brooke, who met Michael as a grad student at the 
university, is a realistic, three-dimensional creation because she loves 
Michael, but doesn't feel that she is being returned that emotion, and, in 
the beginning, can't understand why Michael is going to such great lengths to 
uncover criminals who very likely are innocent people. A startling twist 
occurs with her character midway through, which I would rather walk on sharp 
pins than give away, but it must be said that I was more filled with 
conflicting emotions of shock and disappointment than I have been in a very 
long time at the movies.
As the Lang's, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are perfectly cast. Robbins 
appears threatening even when he is acting like a happy-go-lucky family man, 
while Cusack, usually a comedic actress, is downright creepy as the 
too-good-to-be-true Cheryl. After seeing Cusack in this role, which is so 
convincingly portrayed, I fear I might have a little difficulty in the future 
deciphering Joan from Cheryl. Together, Oliver and Cheryl's relationship 
reminded me a great deal of the off-kilter 1989 horror satire, "Parents," in 
which a young boy suspects his buoyant parents are actually cannibals who 
murder people and perform sadistic rituals late at night while he's sleeping.
It's rare in today's times to find a motion picture that still can 
alternately surprise you, get you deeply involved in the characters, and put 
you right on the edge of you seat, but that is exactly what "Arlington Road" 
has done. It should be noted that this film has been delayed for several 
months, first to acquire a stronger release date, then to avoid any 
controversy due to the Columbine school shooting, but it was definately worth 
the wait. Aside from a few minor, questionable plot gaps, "Arlington Road" is 
a superb film dealing with paranoia that is not easily forgotten, and may 
even force you to question the characters of the people in your own life. Who 
knows what lurks right below the surface?

The idea of a slick Hollywood thriller is a tricky thing. The film wants to
give the audience the thrills they were promised, but yet the artists
involved also want to give the audience something of substance. A carefully
realized thought or topical plotline that can give the otherwise lightweight
film so much dramatic weight. "Arlington Road" is the perfect example of
this type of movie. A movie that tries to balance both thrills and thought
on the same platter.
Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a professor who teaches a course in
terrorism at a local college. When he rescues a neighbor's child from death
one afternoon, Michael begins to get to know the mysterious nearby
residents(Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack), letting them into his life and into the
life of his child and girlfriend (Hope Davis). When Michael begins to
suspect the couple of possible militia involvement, he unknowingly sets off
a chain reaction of events that will change his life forever.
Director Mark Pellington is a veteran of music videos (Pearl Jam's "Jeremy")
and one other feature, 1997's ultra thin "Going All The Way". His style is
very specific: throw the camera around a bit, light the whole thing with a
$1.99 flashlight - who cares if this artistic choice hinders the scene - and
most importantly, get great actors to spew out incredibly bad lines of
dialog but still are able to retain a certain amount of credibility. This is
a very junky thriller with lots of potential but Pellington is not a very
good director and "Arlington Road" is about half of a great film. While
tension-filled, the film doesn't ever really take off the way most of us
would love to see. The film remains too grounded in it's own pretentious
delivery to ever breathe freely.
Jeff Bridges is coming off playing the most career-defining role he has ever
played, that of Jeff Lebowski in the Coen Brother's "The Big Lebowski"(but
you can call him "The Dude"). It was a brilliant performance, cementing
Bridges's reputation as the best of his breed. A real middle American actor
with range to spare and talent to burn. "Arlington" asks Bridges to turn his
trademark wild-eyed paranoia bit into a full scale performance. Nobody can
play skepticism like Bridges. Nobody. It comes as no wonder to tell you that
Jeff Bridges is the one thing that keeps you glued to the screen in
"Arlington". All the twists and turns in the world cannot save a inherently
bad film. Bridges makes you want to see what the outcome of this highly
implausible thriller is going to be. At turns heartbreaking (in scenes
involving Michael's recollection of his dead wife) and deeply disturbing
(the discovery of the dying boy that opens the film), Bridges's performance
is spot-on the entire film.
The rest of the cast is less successful. I admire Tim Robbins more for his
directing lately than his acting. The film doesn't give Robbins much more to
do except look menacing. It's not one of his superior performances. Joan
Cusack is also wasted in a role that is way beneath what she is capable of.
What she does do with her small character leaves a mark, but so much more
should have been accomplished with her. I blame Ehren Kruger's ungraceful
script. The screenplay is full of twists, each one a little more theatrical
than the last. I know that this is a movie with a movie plot, but Kruger
occasionally drops tidbits of real interesting dialog and story with Michael
's lectures to his terrorism class. These scenes are the best in the film.
They give the character the depth needed for the climax of the film, and
they truly give off the uneasy vibe of militias and terrorism that the rest
of the film works overtime to achieve.
The ending of "Arlington Road" is one that will be the one thing most talked
about when this movie is discussed. It is very disturbing, very vivid, and
entirely appropriate. It's also one I wish I could explain in great detail
here, but I won't. This conclusion is something that Pellington and Kruger
do perfectly. The rest of the film is never really inadequate, just missing
something that obviously Pellington couldn't provide: a strict narrative and
appropriate visual choices. I wish him luck in the future, but if he never
makes another film, that will be good luck for us all.----- 6

When someone's paranoid in a movie and no believes him or her, that paranoia
will be justified. It's cliche. Similarly, when the neighbors are perfect,
they aren't. In Arlington Road, Michael Faraday, (Jeff Bridges) teacher of
an American-Terrorism course, suspects his neighbors just might be
terrorists. And no one believes him. And this isn't the second installment
of Blown Away. It does fade-in moments after an explosion, though, with one
of the strongest opening sequences since se7en, which both sets the
combustible tone for the rest of the movie and, in economical fashion,
serves to introduce widower Faraday to his new neighbors, Oliver Lang (Tim
Robbins)and stepford-wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack).
Soon enough Faraday begins to uncover what we already know from the trailer:
that the Langs aren't perfect. Which makes all the foreshadowing concerning
them a little heavy-handed, but so be it. In writer Ehren Kruger's credit,
however, Faraday's dawning suspicion is at least layered in with grief for
his wife, which is effecting his current relationship with his girlfriend,
whose presence is causing something of a rift between Faraday and his son,
etc. And all this develops more or less simultaneously, to the point where
it begins to seem this may all be one of those narratives where the
emotionally-maimed protagonist (Faraday) is only able to achieve cathartic
release via immersion in some high-tension storyline.
But it's not.
At it's most basic level it's closer to another narrative, most recently
commercialized in Sleepers : the criminal initially getting away with the
crime, then somewhere down the road encountering one of his victims wholly
by chance, who metes out justice. But too, and in spite of its cast,
Sleepers was a failure. Arlington Road isn't, again thanks to strong
writing, to the fact that Oliver Lang isn't directly implicated in the death
of Faraday's wife, but is instead simply identified as the type whose file
gets flagged by the FBI. Faraday's wife died investigating such a flag.
Constructing it this way you get the association without the causality,
which--because not dependent upon serendipity--is even stronger. Meaning we
wholly expect Faraday to mete out some long-overdue justice to Lang, which
is right where Kruger wants us: these carefully cultured expectations allow
Arlington Road to use less contrivance to turn everything upside down, which
it does very effectively in the closing frames. And quietly.
The thing is, in a movie about bombs, the plot's about subtlety. Not just
the inevitable surprise we've come to anticipate, but a development which
forces us to reconstruct the whole movie scene by scene. Which is rarely
done well. Even rarer is that, in retrospect, (and disregarding the opening
sequence) every prior event is open to dual interpretation. Perhaps it was
Mark Pellington's unobtrusive camerawork that eased our suspicions; perhaps
it was simply Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges on-screen together, never a
mistimed delivery or stray eyebrow between them. Either way, Arlington Road
is far and away the best college-professor-just-trying-to-get-out-alive
movie since D.O.A., though it is loyal to it all the same.

     Whether or not "Arlington Road" slips in beneath your tolerance
radar screen depends on a variety of factors -- how much you like
improbable action/adventure, how much of a stickler you are for
plausibility, how much coincidence you can stand, how much umbrage you
take at having your intelligence insulted, that sort of thing.  On the
plus side, it's pretty well-acted, with some good fast-paced suspense
sequences.  On the minus side, it's a ridiculous, sloppy piece of
junk.
The movie was ready for release last year but was held off
because of public sensitivity about the very similar Oklahoma City
bombing, and then derailed again earlier this year by the Columbine
shootings.  It finally saw a window of opportunity between spasms of
American violence and got its opening.
Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a widower teaching a course
about terrorism at a Washington university.  He doesn't seem to have
any other classes, or much else to do besides cope with his withdrawn
son (Spencer Treat Clark) and girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis), and
brood in his dark house about his deceased wife, an FBI agent who was
killed in a botched Ruby Ridge-type raid.  Until, that is, he meets
the neighbors.  Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack)
are what God had in mind when He created the Midwest.  But Michael,
with precious little to go on beyond Oliver's pudding face and
porridge-bowl haircut, begins to suspect that his Ozzie-and-Harriet
neighbors are really Mr. and Mrs. Tim McVeigh.  He can't convince
anybody -- not Brooke (who leaves the room every time he mentions his
late wife), not his wife's old FBI colleague (Robert Gossett).
A premise of the movie is that Americans would rather feel safe
than get to the bottom of things, and once we've arrested somebody in
a terrorist case we don't even want to think about far-reaching
conspiracies.  The core idea on which this exercise in paranoia is
constructed is an intriguing one, but so much of Ehren Kruger's
screenplay turns on the most far-fetched coincidences and
improbabilities that it stumbles over itself like a drunk in an
earthquake.  It's the kind of movie you come out of with a laundry
list of protests, and then keep thinking of more on the way home.  It
fails Alfred Hitchcock's cheese sandwich test -- if a thriller is
successful, you won't think about its holes until you've had time to
get home and are making a cheese sandwich.
The ending toward which the movie drives us (with depressing
literalness) is a nice twist, but getting there isn't much fun, and
again we're asked to swallow plot devices that require people to act
unerringly in very specific and highly unlikely ways.  If my plan for
blowing up a federal building depended on such unpredictable behavior,
I doubt I could get any respectable terrorist organization this side
of the Mississippi to back it.
Bridges and Robbins are good, but show-stealing honors go to the
wonderful Joan Cusack, whose smile will never strike you as quite so
innocent and goofy again.

minutes. R (violence)
The day after I saw this movie, I was reading in The New York Times 
George Vecsey's analysis of the US women's soccer team victory. 
(Vecsey is both a paragon of sports writers and an excellent author 
of non-sports books, including "Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner's Daughter" 
the bestseller which became a great movie). I quote:  "Now the 
American women are hot, but, then again, America lives for temporary 
diversion and instant gratification -- new pop groups, new 
sunglasses, new cars, new Internet stocks." One might add to this 
many other items, including new movies, such as Arlington Road.
The following day I received a TBS announcement for a made-for-cable 
film, First Daughter, about the kidnapping of the President's 
daughter by American terrorists. As Voltaire said about God, "if He 
didn't exist, he should have been invented." Hollywood, in the 
absence of that so-useful Big Bad Soviet Bear, predictably turned to 
world-wide terrorism , including home-grown American destroyers. As 
in Arlington Road, an ambitious but disappointing opus.
At  D.C.'s George Washington University, Professor Faraday ( Bridges) 
teaches courses on terrorism. He's a widower with his boy, Grant. His 
FBI-agent wife, was killed in a Federal cock-up. Faraday is being 
semi-consoled by Brooke, one of his graduate students. He lives on 
Arlington Road where he makes friends with neighbors Oliver (Robbins) 
and Cheryl Lang (Cusack). Then he begins to suspect that Oliver is 
not the architect he claims to be, but a terrorist leader...
The film open with the protracted, unexplained sequence. A heavily 
bloodied, badly burnt boy staggers down a street. Just as you think 
that he'll fall down dead, he is rescued by Michael Faraday who 
drives him to a hospital. It's all  done as a skillful "internal" 
montage, whose horror, however, does not really hide goofs and 
improbabilities. Item: in a close-up, a drop of blood falls on one of 
the boy's sneakers. Seconds later, the same sneaker has no blood. 
Item: Arlington Road is a suburban street flanked by many houses and 
lawns but I cannot remember seeing any people around. It is far too 
convenient that the only driver who notices the kid's predicament is 
Faraday. Item: the child  rapidly goes from apparent death throes to 
a lightning-fast recovery with one arm in a cast as the only visible 
sign. The explanation of the boy's condition, given by his parents, 
the Langs, is a fireworks accident.
All this is an artificial gimmick to have Faraday and the Langs meet 
and develop
nice, neighborly relations. The couple has a  boy, Brady, and two 
girls.  Brady and Grant become best friends. This is held in reserve 
for future, nefarious purposes. It is also is a gimmick for 
dis-alienating the orphan Grant who disapproves of papa's girlfriend 
Brooke, and for turning the 8-year old into a "regular American boy," 
a fact that gets worked into the plot.
Another ho-hummer. Michael Faraday's questioning of Oliver's 
kosher-ness as a designer of malls starts with his 2-seconds' glimpse 
of plans that are not of a mall but of an office building. Quick 
eyes, what?
Item: when later Michael needs to look at those plans by getting into 
the Lang house when the couple is not there, the two little girls who 
open the door are uncharacteristically pan-faced and suspicious; 
Michael's excuses for entering are woolly-minded, blatantly dumb. So 
is his search.
Item: Brooke, rather thinking that Michael's suspicions are paranoid, 
is an  unbelievably obtuse naysayer. So is the FBI agent, a friend of 
Michael's.
Cliche Item: when a good person is feverishly phoning about a 
discovery from a pay-phone, and turns around, the enemy is standing 
there.
Improbable Item: Michael is checking old newspaper files about 
Oliver...who suddenly appears behind him.
Cliche Item: the obligatory as well as unbelievable car chase.
Impossible Item: the way chasers and chased connect.
Goof Item: a car is hit broadsides; next that side is shown undamaged.
[Here I eliminate about dozens of other items]
The finale is highly improbable but does score a point by going 
against the guesses of audiences conditioned by too many action Good 
vs. Evil flicks. I won't disclose it.
The script of Arlington Road-- a name evoking Red, White and Blue 
patriotism-- wastes much money and technical talent  during its two 
hours where nothing makes sense. Its photography and editing are 
artsy not arty. Story an dialogue go overboard with deviousness and 
indirection. Has no one learned from Alfred Hitchcock the value of 
clarity ?. The whole is an alienating mess, and a probably uncalled 
for stress on large-scale, minutely organized, hugely financed (but 
by whom?) American terrorism.
The movie's events are under the sign of  The World Trade Center and 
Oklahoma City bombings, and the mess at Ruby Ridge. Consciously or 
not, it connects with such good pictures as The Invasion of The Body 
Snatchers, The Stepford Wives, Seconds, Rosemary's Baby, et al., that 
is, films where people are not what they seem to be.
Rescuing it from total destruction are good performances by Bridges 
who is convincing in his pain and obsessions; by Robbins who is 
smooth and would be frightening if credible; and by the clever 
casting of ever-charming Joan Cusack as a wolf in lamb's clothing.

   Just when you thought you could put to bed the idea that
the Kennedy assassination was a conspiracy, along comes a
thriller that makes you think that such an intricately-planned
operation could not have been the work of one loser. 
"Arlington Road," a political blockbuster that recalls Alan J.
Pakula's "The Parallax View," deals more with large-scale
terrorist activity in the U.S. than with a plot to assassinate
one man.  But by carefully showing the enormous amount of
planning that political criminals make to carry out a plan by
clockwork, Mark Pellington's tingler--from a script by Ehren
Kruger that alternates flashes of intense anxiety with
moments of almost sluggish meditation--cannot help giving
the viewer the impression that guys like Lee Harvey Oswald
are mere patsies for sophisticated and malevolent schemers.
   Summoning memories of the bombings of corporate and
governmental buildings in New York and Oklahoma City,
"Arlington Road" recollects events as diverse as the recent
bloodbath at Columbine High School and, in fact, rumor has it
that the opening of the film was postponed in deference to
that cataclysmic incident.  But while "Arlington Road" has
obligatory moments of savagery, director Pellington is far
more interested in portraying the steady emotional
deterioration of a good man who is already on edge because
of the recent tragic death of his wife--an F.B.I. agent who had
been gunned down in a botched raid on a presumed right-
wing cult.  Like "The Parallax View," this film shows how a
cerebral fellow becomes increasingly frightened to the point
of paranoia each time he uncovers new evidence of a far-
reaching political conspiracy.  Whereas in Alfred Hitchcock's
"Psycho" and currently in Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" the
paranoid personalities are exhibited as is, in Ehren Kruger's
script we observe how a man's mental state steadily and
rapidly declines as his research into an alleged criminal
unfolds new confirmations.  However unbalanced the central
character's faculty becomes, the viewer cannot help coming
away from this movie with the sense that this disintegration
can happen to any of us, given the right circumstances.
   The opening scene, photographed by Bobby Bukowski as
though events were taking place in a drug-induced nightmare,
reveals a frightened 9-year-old boy running spastically across
a suburban road, blood dripping slowly onto his sneakers. 
His life is saved by American History teacher Michael
Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who happens upon the lad while he is
driving home and rushes him to a hospital.  This incident
leads to Faraday's being introduced to the boy's parents,
Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and Oliver's wife Cheryl (Joan
Cusack)--who until then have pretty much kept to themselves. 
Both Faraday and Lang have been emotionally on edge, the
latter for an event which occurred when he was a teenager,
and Faraday for having lost his F.B.I.-employed wife who was
gunned down in a shootout.  Faraday has meanwhile hooked
up with a former graduate assistant, Brooke Wolfe (Hope
Davis) to whom he confides results of research into his
neighbor's background.  Insisting that Lang is involved in a
murderous conspiracy against the federal government, he
fails to convince either Brooke or his contact in the F.B.I.,
Agent Whit Carver (Robert Gossett).  Unable to sway the
people closest to him, Faraday increasingly loses his
balance.
   At many points in this frequently pulsating film, Bridges has
a difficult time convincing the audience as well.  One of
America's finest actors, Bridges--perhaps the current
decade's answer to Robert Mitchum--is best known for his
hangdog and manic expressions, as in his performance as a
wastrel in "Cutter's Way" and as well for the energy he
exhibits in "Tucker."  He was at his best in Peter Weir's 1993
film "Fearless" as the stunned survivor of a plane crash who
is unable to cope with his family but finds solace with another
survivor who has lost her baby in the same accident.  This
time around, his character must deal not only with the pain of
losing his wife so tragically in a gun battle but with the
knowledge that he is on to a major conspiracy while the
people he leans on the most are patronizing, if not simply
skeptical. 
   Sandwiched between a high-strung opening and a tension-
filled conclusion, "Arlington Road" is, like Alan J. Pakula's
"Consenting Adults," yet another take not simply on what
distress kindles beneath the competent surface of educated
people but as well with the danger lurking under the civilized
and manicured veneer of a picturesque suburban community. 
During World War 2 a popular expression about Australia was
"there's no hiding place down there."  Pellington reinforces
that concept with his new movie.  While two vast oceans
serve as America's moat protecting the republic from foreign
invasion since 1814, and while the Cold War is now a fading
memory, we must confront the enemy that lurks within. 
Whether you live in New York's Columbus Circle or the
suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, you can never feel confident of
your safety.  Michael Faraday makes that point clear in his
passionate lectures to his classes at Georgetown University. 
Oliver Lang hammers the subject home, his quiet suburban
life with his all-American family belying a nefarious intrigue.  
  Yes, Virginia: people can indeed be pushed over the edge
by events beyond their control.  Jeff Bridges' performance as
an already tormented man driven to psychosis by the loss of
his wife, the kidnapping of his boy, and research that
convinces him of a fiendish design against his government, is
both frightening and persuasive.  "Arlington Road" is rousing
summer entertainment.

ARLINGTON ROAD (director: Mark Pellington; screenwriter: Ehren Kruger;
cinematographer: Bobby Bukowski; editor: Conrad Buff; cast: Jeff Bridges
(Michael Faraday), Tim Robbins (Oliver Lang), Joan Cusack (Cheryl Lang),
Hope Davis (Brooke Wolfe), Robert Gossett (FBI Agent Whit Carver), Mason
Gamble (Brady Lang), Spencer Treat Clark (Grant Faraday), Stanley
Anderson (Dr. Archer Scobee),  1999)
If there is one word that describes this conspiracy thriller, a take-off
on the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, that word is
preposterous. Ehren Kruger's slick script is about a recently, grieving
widowed history college professor, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who
is currently teaching a course at GW University on domestic terrorism.
His FBI wife was killed on a fouled-up raid, similar to the one on Ruby
Ridge. His new neighbor in this suburban Washington D.C. neighborhood,
is a structural engineer, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins), who arouses the
suspicion of the professor when he catches him in a white-lie about what
college he attended. The professor thinks he might be into bombing
federal buildings, after he does some online searches tracing Lang's
checkered biography.
This is a sloppily made film, imitative of the smoother made "The
Parallax View." It lures you into thinking it has someplace to go, but
after one coincidence too many and details that don't rationally add up,
this film begins to soon feel like it has been weighed down with lead.
There was never for one moment, after Faraday looks at the plans of a
mall project at Lang's house and says that's not the mall, it's an
office building, did I think that this was going to be a serious story.
And that is one of the major problems with the film, it pretended to be
serious yet it couldn't hold its end in the bargain and provide a story
that made sense.
MTV-trained director Mark Pellington brings his brand of cheap thrills
to the screen, foregoing reality for exploitation, as he tries to
revisit a number of newpaper headlines in recent times about FBI
mistakes and right-wing anarchists blowing up government buildings,
while making a fast-paced film for popular consumption.
It was a loopy story, with a somewhat promising beginning but a terrible
ending. It starts out when Faraday saves his neighbor's kid Brady who
blew up his hand with firecrackers, by rushing him to the hospital, and
that begins a friendship with the Langs built on mistrust. Faraday's
girlfriend Brooke (Hope), a graduate assistant at the university joins
him at Lang's house, where his wife Cheryl (Cusack) is supportive of her
relationship with the professor. The Lang's seem like a benign, suburban
couple, easily smiling and engaging in small talk. Faraday's 9-year-old
boy, Grant, is a troubled youngster, unable to communicate with others,
but becomes more outgoing when he becomes friendly with the 10-year-old
Brady. They go away together to summer camp as scouts, an organization
that Oliver has connections in, and will become later on, a part of the
film's intrigue.
For most of the film, Faraday acts with moral indignation at the
government's seeming cover-ups of the bombings, spouting his own
conspiracy theories against a single individual involved in the bombing
of a federal building in St. Louis, and acting hysterical every chance
he gets. Brooke, as his whiny sweetheart, doesn't have much to do in the
film but learn how to believe that her boyfriend and former teacher can
be right about what he thinks. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play the
smiling but sinister couple until it becomes nerve-wracking to watch
them try and pull this nonsense pose off, any further.
The payoff comes in the film's last fifteen minutes, and it seems so
artificial. The film is resolved in an incredulous fashion, as if it
were trying to evoke a cry of sympathy (ala Oklahoma City) for a tragedy
that seemed acted out for symbolic purposes rather than portraying real
people made up of flesh and blood. The ending depends on the coincidence
that a car crash will take place at an exact time and all other events
would follow suit from there on. There is no possible way that scenario
could work except in a move like this one. If you leave aside the
unconvincing acting, the implausible story, its inane political views,
then you might find this film somewhat entertaining and it may raise for
you some pertinent questions about the FBI's handling of recent
bombings. I just felt annoyed that the script tried to be too cute and I
never warmed up to the way the film was indelicately handled.

ARLINGTON ROAD ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (arlington@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis
screenplay by Ehren Kruger
directed by Mark Pellington
Wrote Josh Young, in issue #493 of "Entertainment Weekly": "With
studios now viewing the mid-level, Oscar-nominated directors as a
luxury they can no longer afford, established auteurs...are facing
increasingly stiff competition from slick young music-video turks
who'll work for a mere pittance." From its galling opening sequence, I
wondered what Arlington Road would look like had it been sired by
someone more established than the director of Pearl Jam's "Jeremy"
clip. Pellington is so mindful of the image' that writer Kruger's
plotting eventually drops off the tightrope of credibility. Could a
veteran filmmaker, comparable in status to the late Alan J. Pakula,
swindle us more successfully with the same screenplay? 
Bridges, who consistently rises above the material, is Michael
Faraday, a professor of anti-terrorism for Washington State. Faraday
one day rushes his neighbours' boy, Brady, to the hospital after
discovering him burnt, bleeding, and walking aimlessly down the
street, the victim of a firecracker mishap. This occasions him to
befriend Brady's parents, the Langs (Robbins, weaker than usual, and
Cusack, who steals the show), and for a while, Faraday appreciates
their company, as do his son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), and
girlfriend, Brooke (Davis). (His FBI agent wife was killed three years
before in the line of duty.) 
Faraday is suspicious by nature, though, and when one or two of Oliver
Lang's anecdotes don't add up, he runs a background check on the
family man. His findings indicate a checkered past for Oliver, but
does that mean the people across the street are involved in extremism?
The evidence that soon piles up-top-secret blueprints, phony
identities-does not suggest differently. 
This latest entry in the paranoia' genre at least presents an enemy
that isn't a shadow government. In its place: a nuclear family.
(Snicker.) Mr. Lang loves to work, Mrs. Lang loves to shop and cook
and hold parties, and the couple has toeheaded children. Faraday's gut
tells him that nobody's home life is this TV-perfect. (Think about it:
they even named one of their kids Brady.) 
Such cynicism bears the mark of an MTV-generation director. So does
the ungraceful editing-David Fincher (who helmed Seven and The Game
after years at video and commercial house Propaganda Films) excepted,
do Pellington and his peers think in strobes? Pellington's cutting
inspires panic rather than tension. He stages frenzied scenes that
whip us into a tizzy without much regard for structure and pace. That
the picture is more kinetic than absorbing also makes its script-holes
easier to spot. (Arlington Road's villains are psychic as well as
psychotic: they foretell Faraday's moves with dubious accuracy.) 
The film's most unnecessary sequence-it grinds the story to a halt-is
also the most self-consciously "provocative": we see children with
heavy artillery, blasting away at feds, most of whom die; we see a
mother shoot Mrs. Faraday in cold blood with one hand, clinging to her
newborn with the other. This is the mandatory nineties
flashback-Faraday reenacts for his students the day he became a widow.
The images just described belong in a more serious picture. 
After all, Arlington Road is only self-important. It has nothing
substantial or enlightening to say on the subject of extremism, though
the children in jeopardy angle does push one's buttons. Unlike The
Parallax View's analogous climax, which may have inspired Kruger,
Arlington Road's grim finish is overwrought-it says more about the
studios' new tolerance for unhappy endings than what it purports to
comment on, America's want for scapegoats.

I don't care how early we are into the year, there will be nothing like this
movie until the new millennium. Finally, a film has come along that challenges
the traditional action/suspense genre and gives new meanings to the words
paranoia and suspense.
Michael Faraday (Bridges) teaches a domestic terrorism class at the local
college, it's his way of remembering his wife who died by accident in a
confused shootout at a house in the woods. After helping the next door
neighbor's boy to the hospital (in a frightening and brilliantly executed
opening sequence) he realizes that he doesn't even know the people who have
been living across the street for a year.
Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins & Joan Cusack) are the creepy neighbors, the
boys begin to bond but paranoid Michael senses something odd about them. He
begins to hunt around to see who Oliver really is, much to the objections of
girlfriend Hope Davis, and discovers he was charged for trying to blow up a
building when he was 15. He also discovers a hidden blueprint behind a painting
in their house.
Will Oliver strike again? As paranoia mounts, he is driven into insanity with
nowhere to turn.
This film uses blackouts extremely well, and I just can't get over how original
and disturbing the ending was. To know that their actually are people out there
like that is enough to frighten a heck lot more than anything else at the
cinema. Arlington Road belongs in the Top 10 Best Films of the Year and earns
my outstanding **** stars.

With Jeff Bridges, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Hope Davis
History professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) meets his new
neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) in a
very dramatic way: he picks up their bleeding 10 year old son Brady in
the street and takes him to the hospital. Brady makes friends with
Michael's son Grant while Michael and his girl-friend Brooke (Hope
Davis) cultivate neighborly relations with the Langs. But the idyll of
barbecues behind picket fences starts to crack all too soon. Suddenly
Michael notices inexplicable discrepancies about his friendly
neighbors. What are those strange blueprints in his office, that
Oliver seems eager to hide from Michael, how was Brady injured and why
did Oliver change his name?
Michael believes Oliver to be a terrorist, but his theories seem so
far-fetched that his friends don't want to believe him. Maybe he spent
to much time studying terrorism. Maybe he simply hasn't gotten over
the death of his wife, an FBI-agent who was killed in a shootout with
alleged terrorists. Or maybe he is just jealous of Oliver, because
Grant will rather talk to him than his father. 
Mark Pellington tackles a hot issue with his story of the friendly
neighborhood terrorist. In the USA and elsewhere people prefer to
believe in threats from outside, and if it has to be one of us` then
some half-crazed loner who acted on his own. But please, not an
organization working in the dark with frightening efficiency and able
to hit anywhere and any time. A decent family man who builds shopping
malls and takes his daughters to their ballet lessons can't be a
member of such an organization, or can he? And what about his wife,
the pillar of the comunity who looks as if she never does anything
more dangerous than bake cookies in her spare time? Tim Robbins and
Joan Cusack are our worst nightmares. A brilliant casting decision.
Jeff Bridges however is rather disappointing. His main task is yelling
and breathing heavily as he sprints across the set. He can do better.
Hope Davis, the token blonde, isn't worth mentioning. 
ARLINGTON ROAD could have been one of the best movies of 1999, but the
makers relied too heavily on the gullibility of the audience. A little
poetic license is granted, and there may be situations where an absurd
coincidence is the only way out, but this movie features too many
miraculous turns. But even if there are some plotholes still to be
closed the ending is spectacular, unexpected and made me leave the
theater with a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.

        In the wake of the recent Columbine High School tragedy, and the
not-so-recent Oklahoma City bombing, some people felt that a film like the
incendiary "Arlington Road," with its homegrown terrorism theme, might have
difficulty securing a widespread release.  But finally moviegoers are being
given an opportunity to see it, an opportunity well worth pursuing.
        "Arlington Road," for all of the difficult memories it may
reawaken, is an excellent motion picture.
        The only sequence more shocking than the film's disturbing opener
is the last, a heart-pounding, brilliantly-constructed series of events
that comes close to matching the surprise and unconventionality of
"Psycho"'s famous shower scene.  No amount of cold hard currency will force
me to reveal the film's startling denouement, but if you don't leave the
theater visibly shaken then blood does not flow in your veins.
        Sandwiched between these two cinematic highpoints is a taut, tense,
pulse-quickening film which raises the question "What do your neighbors get
up to behind closed doors?" and then goes on to answer that question in
truly terrifying style.
        The film stars Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, and Joan Cusack and is
written and directed by Mark Pellington, who shows great promise with this,
his second feature.  Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a history professor at
a District of Columbia university who teaches a class on terrorism.  After
helping the injured son of some new neighbors from across the street,
Bridges begins to suspect the normal-looking Langs of plotting a diabolical
scheme involving explosive devices.  Normal-looking, that is, except for
Robbins' severe haircut; just one look at that do and you *know* he's
guilty!
        Faraday's paranoia builds to national security-threatening
proportions, much to the frustration of his girlfriend (sympathetically
played by Hope Davis), and leads to a confrontation that thrusts his whole
family into immediate danger.
        Perhaps the scariest thing about the film is the justifiable fear
of a normal guy realizing how little he knows about the true characters of
his closest neighbors, what they might have hidden behind drapes, buried in
basements, or locked away in attics.  One of Pellington's trump cards is
that he doesn't tip the audience off earlier than necessary in determining
who's the real crazy in this drama.  And he made wise casting choices in
maintaining that suspense: Bridges is brilliant, as is Robbins, and Cusack
(in a rare straight role) has hardly been better.
        In addition to the fine performances, Angelo Badalamenti's creepy
score helps crank up the tension several notches.
        Several years ago, during the filming of a similar Jeff Bridges
mad-bomber thriller called "Blown Away," special effects experts
miscalculated and blew out windows of unrigged buildings adjacent to the
set.  Be prepared to be blown away by "Arlington Road": it carries that
amount of unexpected power.

Those who distrust government in many cases have good reason to do so.
Unfortunately, what many fail to realize is that while we should have little
tolerance for their incompetence, we must accept the fact that as human
beings like us, government is fallible.  There is an exchange of ideology
along these lines in a smart and restless film about domestic terrorism in
'Arlington Road'.
Matching wits with each other are Jeff Bridges as college professor Michael
Faraday who teaches a course in home grown terror while his next door
neighbour Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins), is hiding a past with a fake identity
and many visuals in his home that are strange to say the least.
What do they say?  You have to watch the quiet ones?  Who would think that
American suburbia would be the perfect disguise for such criminal behaviour
as terrorism.  No tents in the forest.  No cabins in the woods.  No little
farm house in the country.  Just your average husband and wife and their
kids, along with others who share in their cause, forcing their politics on
the world through the barrel of a gun and more forcefully through the touch
of a detonator.  Oliver's wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack) is a frightening picture
herself.  She's a woman with a quiet demeanor.  She surprises those lurking
about her and her family like a spider waiting to jump on its next prey.
She uses the element of surprise twice in the film in a very effective
manner.
Oliver and Cheryl live next door to Michael and his girlfriend and Michael's
son in a quiet Virginia neighbourhood where barbecues and kids at play are
the normal thing.  Michael is a father himself and the biggest mistake he
makes is in letting himself get too close to the neighbours to the point
where he inadvertently puts his son's life in danger.  Michael begins to
suspect that his neighbour Oliver is not who he seems to be.  His paranoia
may be justified.  In addition to teaching a course on terror, Michael lost
his wife, a 35 year old FBI agent, in a deadly shoot-out similar to the real
life incident involving federal agents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992.  After
some research through the Internet as well as some advice given to him by a
friend in the FBI, Michael exposes Oliver's true identity but this is only
half the story.  168 people died in the tragic Oklahoma City bombing in
April of 1995 and this film uses an incident taught in Michael's college
class that tones down the loss in a similar situation by mentioning that
approximately sixty people died in a government building.
'Arlington Road' makes itself out to be a story of terrorism made exquisite
on many levels.  It's a psychological thriller along the lines of 1990's
under rated 'Pacific Heights', where Michael Keaton played a menacing tenant
ruining the lives of his two landlords.  'Arlington Road' uses the same form
of psychological tension but on a much grander and wider scale.  It
challenges the viewer to guess how the climax will play out and it never
gets boring for a second.  It's also an angry film laced with political
overtones.  Any decent person knows that bad breaks in life do not justify
criminal behaviour but 'Arlington Road' shows us that some give in to their
hate and always seem to act with a reason.  Timothy McVeigh was said to have
been set off by the incident at Waco since the bombing he was convicted for
happened two years to the day after the raid on the Branch Davidians.
'Arlington Road' stays credible throughout most of its running time and it's
extremely hard to guess what its next move will be.
Many will find the subject matter disturbing but Tim Robbins is the perfect
psychotic and Jeff Bridges is excellent as the everyday man who, in this
case, gets in over his head and fails to go to the authorities until it
might be too late.  Done with the rippling style of a summer movie,
'Arlington Road' probably won't win any awards, but for a film I didn't
expect to see in a summer of juvenile lunacy ruling the box office,
'Arlington Road' stayed with me until well after I saw two other movies.

Starring Tim Robbins, Jeff Bridges and Joan Cusack
Directed By Mark Pellington
An annoying little movie that has immense promise but then doesn't seem to
know how to lead up to it's admirably excellent final twist. Jeff Bridges
plays Michael Faraday, a widower who starts getting suspicions about the
neighbours, Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins and Cusack.) Faradays girlfriend
(Hope Davis) gets more and more annoyed with Michael, but his suspicions
become more and more stronger as he discovers darker and darker secrets
about the friendly guy next door.
The 'neighbour who looks nice but isn't' plotline is nothing new, and the
same clichés pop up in this movie, featuring stereotypes like the cop who
wants to believe the paranoid neighbour but doesn't (Robert Gossett) and the
aforementioned non believing girlfriend. However, Arlington Road delivers
with these elements with more style, rather than more brains, than other
movies than deal with this plotline. Mark Pellington's direction is assured,
with every scene smacking of style, and being very, very dark. There appears
to be little illumination in both the Faradays and the Langs households,
which upsets the cinematography. There's some well handled jump scenes as
well, and the tension reaches astronomically levels in some scenes, such as
where Michael is searching through Oliver's study. But occasionally the
movie seems to plod, the character building scenes aren't developed enough
by screenwriter Ehren Kruger to be of any interest. These scenes really bog
down the film, and I was almost nodding off during some parts of the movie.
There is, however, one outstanding scene at the start which sets up the
characters rather well. Other than that (and the flashback showing the death
of Michaels wife) it's best to ignore any attempts the film makes to develop
the characters, and just sit back and enjoy the showman thriller sequences.
The cast also play their part in creating an believable environment for an
almost unbelievable revelation when it finally appears. Tim Robbins seems to
relish playing the bad guy for once, carrying out scenes with an evil glee.
Unfortunately, he's been plagued with the worst haircut in his career. Jeff
Bridges isn't bad as the paranoid Michael, carrying out the drama and action
pretty well. Hope Davis delivers an acceptable performance, but appears to
be in the movie for eye candy rather than acting prowess. But it takes Joan
Cusack to take the acting honours, as the off centre wife of Oliver. Her
kooky, scary performance is a delight, and rather unsettling. She lights up
the screen every time she appears. And, she looks exactly like her brother
John Cusack, which was certainly very scary.
There's a great soundtrack which certainly helps build up the tension, and
the cinematography is well done. But there's no denying the fact that
Arlington Road, while sporadically _truly_ enjoyable, is a case of style
over substance. Not a total failure, but it didn't live up to what should
have been an easy premise to follow. Although it hasn't got enough plot to
support itself, Arlington Road is certainly an interesting failure, but it
needs strengthening in certain parts.

    Despite its plethora of unanswered questions, and a loud, grating
performance by Jeff Bridges, ARLINGTON ROAD still turns out to be an
effective thriller.  Sort of.  I was reminded of the film SEVEN (the only
movie that has ever left me shaking), with its claustrophobic atmosphere,
moody score (courtesy the great Angelo Badalamenti), and sense of impending
doom.  SEVEN is a far superior motion picture, but I cannot discount any
film that manages to leave me unnerved.
You know right away that Michael Faraday (an unmercifully one-note
Bridges), who teaches a course on terrorism, and Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins),
the seemingly normal guy next door, are going to have problems.  After
rescuing the his neighboršs young boy ­ and, Išm not sure what this scene
has anything to with the rest of the film ­ Tom quickly suspects wrongdoing.
He is obsessed over the death of his wife, and rants about the evil that are
extremist groups ­ all of which seems to feed some basic paranoia he
harbors.  And, thus begins a film-long quest to find out just why somebody
would lie about where they attended college.
I mentioned loose ends:  this movie has em.  For instance, what does
the opening sequence have to do with anything else that comes after?  I
mean, except to introduce the two men.  And why (SPOILER alert), considering
the overall scheme of things, did Michaelšs girlfriend have to die?  What
was the deal with the blueprint, or whatever it was, hidden behind the
picture frame?  Those computers the villains were driving around with??
And, then ARLINGTON ROAD commits the ultimate cinematic no-no of assuming
that climactic events are going to unfold in just the right way, for the
film to pay off like it wants to, when any number of things could go wrong
to avert that ending.  Not that I have problem with this ending, which comes
completely out of left field, but in a good way.  Išm only saying donšt
cheat the audience.  Had ARLINGTON ROAD played fair, the whole way, it
wouldšve been a terrific entertainment.  Lose Jeff Bridges, or at least tone
him down a few trillion notches, and it wouldšve been one of the yearšs
best.

        Just how well do we know our neighbours?  Is a psychopathic
murderer lurking in the house just across the road?  David Lynch often
provides a shattering and unsettling exploration of the bizarre and
sleazy underbelly that lies beyond the comfortable images of the
quaint picket fences and neatly maintained housing lots of suburbia.
Joe Dante brought a more comic approach to the theme with his black
comedy the 'Burbs.
Arlington Road takes this basic theme and neatly marries it
with a touch of the paranoia and cynicism that shaped the best
political thrillers of the '70's, such as The Parallax View and All
The President's Men, etc.  Overtones of both the Oklahoma City and
World Trade Towers bombings also permeate this taut, tense and topical
thriller exploring domestic terrorism in the US.
Jeff Bridges delivers his usual solid performance as Michael
Faraday, a lecturer at George Washington University, who is still
coming to terms with the death of his wife, an FBI agent who was
killed three years ago during a botched raid on a suspected terrorist
encampment.  Obsessed with the nature of terrorism as a political
tool, the embittered Faraday lectures on the topic as part of his
popular course on American history.
One day while returning home to his quiet suburban street he
comes across a teenage boy staggering down the road, with his arm
badly burnt.  Michael rushes the bleeding and dazed boy to hospital
for treatment.  There he meets the boy's concerned parents, Oliver and
Cheryl Lange (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), who happen to be his new
neighbours.  They explain that the boy's arm was injured while playing
with fireworks in the park with some friends.
Michael and the Langes become friends, but Michael soon grows
suspicious of Oliver.  His belief that Oliver is lying and hiding
something leads Michael to an obsessive search into his neighbour's
past.  As he races against time to prove that his neighbour is
actually a terrorist with an advanced degree in explosives, most of
his acquaintances think that the strain is beginning to take its toll.
Is Michael right, or have recent tragic events jaded his perspective?
Bridges brings an intense, wary and highly strung neurotic
edge to his performance.  Robbins delivers a superbly malevolent
performance as Oliver, while Cusack is icily creepy as his wife.
This chilling paranoid thriller from writer Ehren Kruger and
director Mark Pellington efficiently taps into the mind set of most
ordinary Americans, who prefer the comfort of believing in the
officially promulgated theories of lone gunmen and lone terrorist
bombers rather than shadowy high level conspiracies.  Pellington, a
former director of rock videos who made his feature debut with the
disappointing '50's coming of age tale Going All The Way, effectively
tightens the suspense as the film races towards its surprising climax.
Arlington Road doesn't always follow a nicely formulaic path,
and Pellington and Kruger manage to pack in a couple of surprising
twists.  Pellington demonstrates a dazzling visual style that
effectively captures Faraday's increasingly compulsive behaviour, and
bring a nicely neurotic edge to the film.

`Arlington Road' is a film that I would characterize as odd' for a
summertime release.  As you watch the film, it almost feels as if
you're taking a summer course at your local community college called
`The Current Socio-political Environment of Terrorism.'  Would taking
this kind of course be of any interest to you?  Probably not when the
classroom to the right features extra-terrestrials on parade and the
classroom to the left features lesson in sex and baked goods.  But that
is not to say that this is a bad film.  In fact, the more I think about
it, the more I reflect positively on this offering.
`Arlington Road' introduces us to John Farraday (Jeff Bridges) as a
professor of Terrorism.  In class, he openly questions the
effectiveness of the FBI and how it handles cases of domestic
terrorism.  He points out the Saint Louis Federal Building bombing,
which is analogous to the tragedy of Oklahoma City.  He tells his
students that the FBI, after years of painstaking investigation, pinned
all of the blame on just one man.  How could one lone person be the
instrument of such massive destruction, he asks his class.  You can
begin to see the seething distaste that he harbors for the FBI. 
Farraday also takes his class on a field trip to a place called Copper
Creek where a fatal and unnecessary confrontation took place between
those who lived on the property and federal agents.  He explains that
the FBI didn't do enough research before convincing themselves that the
family living there was stockpiling guns for some future terrorist act.
His wife, among several others, is subsequently killed in a gun battle.
 Sadly, he can never get past this personal tragedy, and it manifests
itself into heightened paranoia and a deep suspicion about his new
neighbor, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins). 
Lang is quite odd in many ways.  He keeps to himself, carries himself
as if he had something to hide, and wears a troubled look that's both
suspect and menacing.  Why does Lang not want Farraday to see his work?
 Why does Lang keep getting mail that he insists have been addressed to
the wrong person?  Why was Lang in Saint Louis right around the time
the Federal Building was bombed?  At this point, which is about 45
minutes into the film, the movie moves away from its philosophical
stance and begins to take shape as a psychological drama.  Can Farraday
convince anyone that Lang is dangerous (including a friend who works
for the FBI and his current girlfriend)?  What's Lang's real story?
The movie appropriately takes its time in painting Farraday as a man
passionate about his opinions and consumed with suspicion.  I also
enjoyed Joan Cusack, who plays Oliver's wife.  She's sweet on the
outside, but there's a scary beast within and she projects just the
perfect facial expressions that make her absolutely eerie.  What did
strike me as odd was that near the end, the movie unexpectedly kicks it
up two notches, like some thoroughbred rounding the final corner and
sprinting towards the finish line.  I enjoyed the unexpected ending
that it led us to, but after establishing its pace, it finally succumbs
to a bloody fistfight, car chases, and a whopping explosion.  But let
me say once again that this is a fair offering.  Nonetheless, I'd still
probably choose to enter the classroom on the left or on the right.

Susan Granger's review of "ARLINGTON ROAD" (Sony Pictures/Screen Gems Release)
  This contemporary thriller stars Jeff Bridges as a college
professor whose FBI-agent wife was killed in a botched raid on an
alleged right-wing cult. The film was scheduled to open in May,
shortly after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton,
Colorado. With its tagline, "Fear thy neighbor," its release was
understandably postponed. The theme revolves around how everyday
appearances can be deceiving. This concept is personified by a
seemingly normal, all-American couple - Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack -
who move with their three children into a suburban Washington,
D.C. neighborhood.  Gradually, Bridges, who teaches a course in
terrorism, senses something suspicious about them. Is he just paranoid
or are they part of a lethal, para-military conspiracy?  "There's no
gratuitous violence," Bridges says, "but it does deal with a violent
subject, with militia groups - and how some people express unhappiness
toward the government and their own lives. Certainly, I would hope it
doesn't lead to copycat crimes. However, it's a tough subject: whether
the arts reflect society or lead society. I don't know if we want to
put restrictions on creativity, but, at the same time, we certainly do
not want to inspire people to do violence." Writer Ehren Kruger and
director Mark Pellington are obviously manipulative as they explore
this volatile subject with a stylish scenario that leads to a grim,
uncompromising, over-the-top conclusion. Both Cusack and Robbins seem
to relish their intriguing, intimidating roles with an evil glee, and
Jeff Bridges delivers a solid performance as the tormented widower who
becomes a pawn in their plot to dismantle American society.  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Arlington Road" is a sinister, scary
6, making you skeptical about anyone's safety. It delivers a chilling
shiver on a hot summer's night.

Early in "Arlington Road," terrorism expert Michael Faraday (Jeff 
Bridges) shows his college class a series of horrific images 
reminiscent of the Oklahoma City massacre, then discusses the 
public's willingness to accept the notion that one man could be 
responsible for such atrocities. "We don't want others," he explains. 
"We want one name and we want it fast, because it gives us our 
security back." That's a genuinely disturbing idea and a great way to 
start a movie. "Arlington Road" also boasts a corker of a closing 
scene that is both shocking and thought provoking. If only the parts 
in-between were as good.  
Writer Ehren Kruger's script is the main offender, lobbing an absurd 
number of coincidences at the audience. While most thrillers demand a 
certain suspension of disbelief, Kruger asks viewers to completely 
disengage anything even faintly related to logic. His contrived plot 
stretches credulity further than those amorphous thrillers that pay-
cable channels run in the wee hours of the night. Director Mark 
Pellington doesn't help matters much. Determined to create a 
nightmare-in-suburbia feel, he throws in so much gimmicky lighting 
and skewed camera angles that major portions of the film play like a 
parody of "The Twilight Zone." 
Remember "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," the "there's a monster on the 
wing of our airplane!" horror tale featured in both the TV and movie 
versions of "The Twilight Zone?" In their respective takes on the 
lead role, William Shatner and John Lithgow stammered, twitched, 
jerked and shrieked in deliciously over-the-top performances that 
nicely complimented the outrageous story. Unfortunately, Pellington 
directs Jeff Bridges in the same way here, with embarrassing results. 
Bridges, normally an outstanding actor, must escalate from grieving 
husband to hysterical loon under Pellington's leering camera. 
Bridges' performance is not a pretty sight.  
Set in a upscale suburb in Northern Virginia, the film centers around 
Professor Faraday, who tries to carry on a normal life with his young 
son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) and girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), 
while still grieving the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed during 
a botched raid. After rescuing an injured neighbor boy (Mason Gamble),
 Faraday becomes friends with the boy's parents, Oliver and Cheryl 
Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack). On the surface, the Langs seem 
like a typical all-American family, but Faraday begins noticing 
peculiarities in their wholesome appearance. Suspecting they may be 
part of some extremist group, he begins examining Oliver's background,
 seeking help from Brooke, as well his wife's former partner, Whit 
Carver (Robert Gossett). They both have strong misgivings about his 
mission and counsel Faraday to drop the investigation. After all, 
what are the chances that a terrorism expert, who lost his wife in a 
terrorism-related raid, would end up with terrorists living across 
the street from him? 
Good question. While the film flirts with the notion that Faraday may 
simply be paranoid, it's obvious where things are going, thanks to 
Pellington's ham-handed direction. Oliver and Cheryl Lang peer 
ominously from windows and half-opened doors. They make cryptic 
remarks, clumsily try to block Faraday from looking at blueprints, 
etc., etc. Hell, the monster on the wing of the plane in the 
"Twilight Zone" story was more subtle than these two.
Mark Pellington is a talented man. He took big chances with his first 
film, "Going All the Way," and turned out an extremely dark, faithful 
adaptation of Dan Wakefield's caustic coming-of-age novel. But he 
shows no finesse here, devoting too much time to arty shots of 
shadows and light when he should have been adjusting the screenplay 
to make the plot seem more credible. Instead, we get people popping 
up on the lead characters at just the right time to startle them and 
the audience, regardless of how improbable their arrival might be, 
and we get an incredibly elaborate plan that could not succeed unless 
the conspirators had a psychic awareness of upcoming totally random 
actions on the part of several key individuals. 
Despite such fundamental problems, "Arlington Road" does contain some 
rewards. Tim Robbins gives a good performance and his personal code 
of honor is one of the film's most fascinating elements. Joan Cusack 
and Hope Davis do what they can with their characters, but the women 
are given short-shrift by the screenplay. 
Faraday's early statement to his students is a powerful one, 
reinforced by the surprising twist at the end of "Arlington Road." As 
such, even with its ludicrous screenplay and overwrought lead 
performance, the film still manages to pack a punch. Had the script 
been rewritten with an eye toward making the plot mechanics more 
plausible (even in light of the closing revelations, the Lang's 
behavior and many crucial elements of the grand conspiracy remain 
patently unbelievable), and had Pellington and Bridges worked 
together on toning down Faraday's histrionics, this could have been 
much more than just another popcorn thriller.

Okay, so this is one of the worst cases of a trailer giving away an entire
film's premise step by little step, but I'm a fan of lanky actor Timmy
Robbins, the aging but effective Jeff Bridges, and the cutest little
patootie this side of a goofy aunt we've all known, Joan Cusack. Now let's
see if this film can entertain me!
PLOT:
University professor who teaches a class in domestic terrorism suspects his
"Leave it to Beaver"-type next door neighbors as being a dressed-up family
behind certain harrowing right-wing activities. Does the man suffer from
mass paranoia due to his wife's death to extremists' hands, or is he right
on the ball?
CRITIQUE:
Despite its general predictability and slow start, this film did manage to
grab me by the balls, and fingernail-biting wise, thoroughly entertain me
for its very last half hour. In fact, the ending of this film was one of the
most inspired that I've seen come out of Hollywood in a while. I personally
enjoyed its refreshing conclusion, whilst my better half, Mrs. JoBlo, found
it quite unsatisfying (She loved the film otherwise). It would be fair to
say that this film's script is not its grandest asset, but that its director
is the one who should be applauded for turning this sub-level thrilling
story, into a most interesting thriller with a race to the finish ending
from hell. The shooting style, the dark scenarios, the uneasy feel of its
soundtrack (Note that the man behind those sounds is the very same man who
composed many of weirdo director David Lynch's eerily satisfying
soundtracks, Angelo Badalamenti) are three elements used effectively by the
director to create a decent build-up of tension. It sorta felt like the
movie FALLING DOWN for me, with a man literally "losing it" onscreen.
As the man who "loses it", Jeff Bridges staples his reputation as the actor
with the fluffiest hair in Hollywood, a superb capacity to cry at a drop of
a dime (A few less scenes of him tearing up might've improved my score as
well) and the actor best to be remembered as the slow-motion running dude
towards a camera. Despite those redundancies, Bridges did still manage to
convey a real interesting man who slowly crumbles before our very eyes,
while Robbins creepily presented his neighbor as a sorted side-dish to the
hodge-podge of mayhem. Liking Joan Cusack as I do, I wished they'd have used
her more often in this film, but that predicament was clearly not to be. Add
an extremely powerful opening scene, a slow-to-get-going first hour, a
semi-predictable plot to the stylish wonders of the director, an effective
soundtrack, and some decent acting gigs by all involved, and you've got
yourself an above-average thriller that doesn't break much new ground, but
certainly entertains as a whole. The original ending might turn some off,
but certainly, it helped in certifying my own opinion of this film towards
the green light of recommendation.
No need to see this puppy in the theatres, but certainly an entertaining
video/nacho night treat. Just make sure that you don't watch it with your
neighbors : )
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Screenwriter Ehren Kruger admits that, "Some of the best scenes in the movie
came out of the rehearsal process." He claims that he cannot take credit for
a lot of the best dialogue which "was improvised by these terrific actors."
This film is his first produced script. It won him the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts & Sciences prestigious Nicholl Fellowship for achievement in
screenwriting in 1996.
Director Mark Pellington's wife was the costume designer on this picture.
She is Jennifer Barrett-Pellington. This is Mark's second feature film after
1996's GOING ALL THE WAY. In 1992, he won the "Best Director" prize at the
Billboard Video Music Awards, for his work on the Pearl Jam video "Jeremy".
It also earned him four MTV Video Awards in 1993, including Best Director
and Video of the Year.
Actor Jeff Bridges has been nominated for three Academy Awards, for THE LAST
PICTURE SHOW, THUNDERBOLT & LIGHTFOOT and STARMAN. He is the brother of
actor Beau Bridges. "Beau" means "pretty" in French.
Does anyone remember actress Joan Cusack from her gig on TV's "Saturday
Night Live" during the 1985-86 season? I sure didn't.

 Arlington Road is a most uneven thriller, made more uneven by the nearly 
embarrassing performance of Jeff Bridges, who is forced to act so 
overwrought and paranoid that his character becomes nearly cartoonish.
 The story revolves around an issue that strikes close to home  domestic 
terrorism.
 Bridges plays Michael Faraday, who teaches a course on terrorism at 
George Washington University. A few years earlier, his wife, an FBI 
agent, was killed during a botched raid on a supposed right-wing 
enclave.
 Faraday is still in mourning. He is a man consumed with pain and rage. 
He also has trouble trying to reconnect with his 9-year-old son.
 His new neighbors, the Langs, who recently moved in across the street, 
become friendly with Faraday. The Langs have a young son, and he and 
Faraday's boy become the best of friends.
 But eventually Faraday begins to suspect that Oliver Lang is not who he 
says he is. His investigation, consumed by paranoia, leads him down a 
dangerous and deadly path.
 As directed by Mark Pellington, a veteran of music videos, Arlington 
Road is a frustrating endeavor. Pellington seems more content to play 
with his camera  using whatever odd angles he can devise  to create 
Faraday's nightmarish world.
 It becomes more of a distraction than a dramatic device.
 And Pellington fails to rein in Bridges' over-the-top reading. Bridges 
is one of our best actors, usually able to get under the skin of a 
character. He is best at portraying the average man caught in 
extraordinary situations, such as in Fearless.
 But in Arlington Road, he is all motion  bug-eyed, sweaty and rumpled. 
He seems too unstable, too out of control to be a disciplined college 
professor.
 In contrast, Tim Robbins as Oliver Lang and Joan Cusack and his wife, 
Cheryl, behave normally and underplay their respective roles as the 
couple with a secret.
 Robbins also shows a streak of decency and honor as he protects 
Faraday's son because the professor had saved the life of Lang's son 
after a fireworks accident.
 Cusack is almost June Cleaverish, but with a dark streak that she subtly 
reveals throughout the movie.
 Overall, Arlington Road has some fine sequences, but as a whole, the 
movie is an aggravating experience. The film falls very short of its 
potential.

Usually, when audience members talk during a movie, it shows a fundamental
lack of disrespect to the moviemakers, the actors, and their fellow
patrons.  If they're talking about plot points they missed in the movie, it
shows that they're easily confused or just not paying attention.  If
they're talking about things other than the movie -- like where to go for
dinner afterward -- that's a sign that you're dealing with people who are
totally oblivious to their environment and to moviegoing etiquette.
I don't have any way to measure this, but I believe it's getting worse.  I
went to see Lawrence of Arabia last week at the Paramount Theater in Austin
(in 70mm format, the only way to go) and this woman behind me asked her
date what year the movie was set in... and he gave her a ten thousand word
masters thesis on World War I and the Triple Entente.  This intermixed with
a blow by blow account of the first ten minutes of the movie that she had
missed while standing in line to get popcorn.  He talked almost the whole
way through the movie... no mean feat when we're talking about a three-hour
movie.
I say that to say two things.  First, if you're the kind of person who
talks at movie theaters, you might want to consider renting movies instead,
so you can talk all you want without disturbing other people.
Second, Arlington Road has the best screenplay of the summer.  I know this
because during every slack moment in the second half of the movie, I could
hear everyone else in the theater whispering to each other, trying to keep
up with the twisty plot.  It wasn't individual voices as such, but a
general background buzz from bewildered people trying to figure out what
was coming next.
In this, possibly the dumbest summer in movie history, the summer of
Jar-Jar Binks, the summer dedicated to the glorification of the lowest
common denominator, Arlington Road is... Yes!  A Smart Movie!  Arlington
Road is not one of your artsy-fartsy Merchant Ivory films that you need a
degree in art history to appreciate, mind you, it's just a thriller... but
it's a smart thriller that stays two or three mental steps ahead of its
audience and never insults our intelligence by asking us to believe
anything really stupid.  The plot is simple enough -- a family of
terrorists move across the street from a terrorism expert, who gets
suspicious -- but the elaborations of that plot are deftly done.
For example, we know from the outset as an audience that the Tim Robbins
character is an evil terrorist.  We know this because movies about people
who have unfounded suspicions about their wacky neighbors don't do very
well.  We know this because of the credit sequence, which shows us
negatives of dogs and picket fences and crabgrass and lets us know that
evil lurks in the heart of suburbia.  And we know this because Robbins
plays his character with a featureless, dull exterior that proves that he's
hiding something.
But what makes Arlington Road so smart is that the Jeff Bridges character
doesn't know any of this stuff.  He's got his suspicions, but they're based
on next to nothing.  Bridges finds out, for example, that the Robbins
character is from St. Louis, where terrorists blew up that federal
building.  (Arlington Road pretends that the Murrah Building bombing took
place in St. Louis, but knows that we're smart enough to see through
this.)  Ipso facto, Robbins is a terrorist, right?  But Bridges can't make
anyone believe this but us.  There's one wrenching scene where he's trying
to explain things to Hope Davis (in the unappreciated girlfriend role), and
he's raving like a Class-A nutter, and she's holding him, and he can't stop
spouting off about how this guy next door is a terrorist.
Another sign of intelligence from Arlington Road is how it handles the
inherent insanity in the setup.  It makes sense, in a twisted, paranoid
sort of way, that the Bridges character would see terrorists everywhere,
but what would motivate the Robbins character to move right next door to
him?  (The housing shortage in DC isn't that bad, is it?)  Arlington Road
has an answer to this, one I won't share with you.
In fact, when you get right down to it, when you have a movie that's this
smart, with smart plot twists, there's not that much you can say about it
without spoiling the fun for everyone.  The minor things that help make the
movie work -- the pouty curve of Hope Davis's mouth, the perky smile of
Joan Cusack, the way the Robbins' two little girls look in plaid jumpers
while they bar the door to the house, the horrible things that happen to
Bridges's perfect hair during the course of the movie, Tim Robbins
lip-synching to the words of the Boy Scout oath --are great, but they're
secondary to the sinuous curve of the screenplay as it unwinds itself.
For all fans of Smart Movies, Arlington Road is as welcome as a tall glass
of lemonade during a heat wave, with smart performances, smart casting, and
smart directing complementing an exceptionally smart screenplay.  This...
yes!  is a movie to talk about.
