If you've seen the trailers for Fight Club, you will probably be expecting
a different film than the one you will see. It is not spceifically all
about fighting clubs, and the goings on there, but about a man's journey
outside of himself, his "normal" life, everything he knows and takes for
granted, and then back again, and his relationship with the man that will
change his life, and the lives of many others as well.
The violence depicted in the film is brutal and realistic, and we
thankfully only see the actual goings on at the "fight clubs" a few times
during the course of the two hour plus movie. But when we do, we are not
spared, and the camera almost never looks away when it should. 
Edwrad Norton plays an insomniac. In order to find release and get some
much needed sleep, and on the advice of his doctor, he starts attending a
therapy group for testicular cancer, where he lets his guard down and ends
up crying on Bob's (Meatloaf) large male hormone imbalance induced breasts.
After that,
Norton becomes addicted to the group therapy, and attends a different group
every night, which is also how he meets Marla. Marla is also a "tourist".
And Norton can't cry with another faker around, and so, he relapses into
insomnia. So they eventually strike up a deal, on who goes to what groups
on what day in a funny, if slightly morbid scene. A lot of the humor in
Fight Club comes from such awkward or disturbing places.
Norton later meets Tyler Durdern on an airline flight, where they strike up
a conversation, and Durden gives Norton his business card. When Norton
comes home to his condo, he finds his his apartment has exploded, So he
calls Durden to perhaps get some shelter. and after a brawl outside a bar,
which leads to the creation of the fight club, ends up finding refuge at
Tyler's run down house. 
Tyler lives the complete opposite to Norton. His house is a dive, and the
jobs he takes other than selling his soap, are basically a means for his
mischief. Tyler has total disdain for the status quo, the lives of normal
people who are sheep, herded around by what they do, what they want, and
what they own. Durden's has an almost obsessive need to free everyone
else's id from the shackles of corporate america's superego. Tyler and
Marla eventually get involved which each other, which bothers Norton,
although he can't understand why, since he doesn't seem to like Marla at
all, or at least, pretends he doesn't. Setting up a conflict between Norton
and Pitt's characters which builds to the point where Norton beats an
attractive man to a bloody pulp
for falling more into favour with Pitt, in a scene reminiscent of Raging
Bull's "he ain't pretty no more" scene.
The amount of Fight Club members grows during the film, across the country,
to an almost "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" level where The Fight Club
becomes a 
recruitment center for Durden's mass mischief plans. As the bigger pictures
becomes clearer towards the end
of the film, even the details of "project mayhem" isn't the final cimactic
revelation of the movie.
The performances in the film are excellent. Norton's everyman, and Pitt's
not-so-everyman are wonderful, and in Pitt's case, probably his best work.
If you've ever wondered what id and ego would sound like if they spoke to
each other out loud, then you're in for a treat as  that's how Pitt and
Norton's characters get along with each other. Helena Bonham Carter's
fiesty Marla is also a terrific performance. The lone woman in the film,
(excluding Meatloaf's breasts) who is as tough on the inside as any of the
men, or at least, pretends to be. She just needs attention to keep her from
thinking about herself and from making half-hearted attempts on her own
life. Marla's "fight club" is found in Tyler Durden's bed and in her stormy
relationship slash friendship with Norton.
David Fincher's directing is an extremely stylized departure that he seems
to have been working towards ever since Alien 3. Fincher's camera swoops
down buildings, through bulletholes in windshields, and other places that
can only be achieved through subtle useage of computer technology, not
excluding the bizarre brief sex scene between Marla and Durden. I haven't
seen a film this stylistically powerful since Pulp Fiction, only where that
film snap crackled and popped, Figh Club's viceral experience is like an
atomic blast. Fincher takes us places we've never been, and some places we
probably shouldn't be going to.
I've heard Fight Club as being called a film about a lot of things,
including "emasculated males in the age of feminism", which not being a
woman or emasculated,  I can't disagree with enough. Although in the film
Durden does mention being part of a generation brought up by their mothers,
but that is a direct reference to both Durden and Norton's characters
fathers having left them at a young age, and the dynamic between Pitt's Id,
Norton's Ego, and the partial superego of their absent fathers.
The purpose of the Fight Club is as much therapy as the testicular cancer
survivors sharing their pain with the group. Only in Fight Club, they don't
just share the pain, they dish it out as well. Their pain truly becomes
another's pain. And in that pain, they find release. Everyone is equal, and
there is no room for tourists. But "Fight Club" the movie isn't just about
the fight clubs, or violence, it's about a lot more. There is much subtext
to the story, and everyone's opinions have validity, even "feminist
emasculation". Fight Club is one of the rare films that begs to be thought
about afterwards, not just tossed out of mind with yesterday's empty action
flick.

The cultural anthropologists suggest we play violent sports because--in a
more or less peaceful society--we have no other socially-condoned outlet for
our aggression(s). But not everyone boxes on the week-ends. Some just go see
movies like David Fincher's Fight Club, which, as with Natural Born Killers,
gives us vicarious access without the sweat, blood, and legal repercussions.
And it is over-the-top, lookaway violent. And,
surprise surprise, it's not just Bloodsport or Lionheart or Mortal Kombat.
Which is to say there's actually some real storytelling going on. Ten
minutes in you think you can predict it, which is comfortable, but then it
spins out of control, becomes unpredictable, and suddenly you're no longer
in the Bloodsport-genre.
It is, however, a very controlled spin, incessantly voiced-over by
our Narrator, 'Jack,' (Edward Norton), a Wonder Years approach which serves
to turn Fight Club into his monologue. What he's doing is catching us up
with story of his 'fall,' which is to say he's reconstructing that story for
us, which gives him gives him freedom to play fast and loose not only with
sequence but with the perceived reality of the movie. Yes, there are a few
Woody Allen-ish (Ferris Bueller-ish) talking-into-the-camera meta-moments,
but, to Fight Club's credit, they are entertaining, and do occasionally
provide a chunk of narrative exposition that would have otherwise required
some serious contrivance to introduce. So, the meta-moments are economical,
but just barely.
But back to 'Jack' our insomniac, stuck in an office job, defining
himself by his mail-order furniture, hoping for a break in the monotony of
consumer-existence. Sum: he prays for a plane crash, and instead his
apartment is blown up, which is to say he's reborn in flames, he can rise
Phoenix-like from the ashes of his former life and move on. All of which
sounds over-the-top melodramatic, but it's in keeping with the tone of the
rest of the movie. Now enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, in another 12 Monkeys
counter-establishment role), dressed like Dennis Rodman, the
complete inverse of everything 'Jack' claims to be. Where 'Jack' is
leading an inauthentic existence, Tyler is the real thing. He's the answer
to the question 'Jack' can never quite articulate, that he's been looking
for in cancer-support groups.
Now he doesn't need those support groups anymore, though. He
has Tyler, his Dean Moriarty, and, soon enough, the underground
phenomenon called Fight Club, which satisfies his/their need for the
authentic, via defining fighting (pain) as self-knowledge. And
self-knowledge is of course the generic simile for the authentic. And, as
they find out, their need for the authentic in a commercially constructed
world is epidemic: Fight Club spreads like wildfire. Across the nation,
even. But then, at its height, it morphs into Tyler's idea of controlled
demolition, something called Project Mayhem, which is all about anarchy,
bringing down the establishment, starting America over, better this time.
Which is the point at which this all becomes untrivial for 'Jack.' It
was supposed to just be something like therapy for him (in the unlikely
guise of Ultimate Fighting), but now it's no longer about him. And,
predictably, there's even a damsel-in-distress he needs to save: Marla
Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, no longer Ophelia), fellow 12-step junky. And,
in addition, there's even one big secret about Fight Club, almost of the
calibre of the secret The Crying Game tried to keep, or Sixth Sense. Think
Jekyl and Hyde, or even comedy, The Man With Two Brains. Or, specifically,
Lost Highway. Fight Club does, after all, have the that same
hyper-reality of the dreamstate. And it does open in the dendritic spaces of
'Jack's internal organs, a nervescape Three Kings has already acquainted us
with. Suffice it to say that whereas the first part of the movie is about
needing a Tyler Durden and the middle part is about living with a Tyler
Durden, the last part is all about fighting Tyler Durden, trying to save the
girl, trying to save the commercial America his prior self was so dependent
upon.
And yes, there are some weak re-cap moments in those last 15
minutes--Fincher trying to rationalize the big secret--and some stuff so
over-the-top that it redefines Fight Club as 'fantastic,' but fantastic
isn't all bad. And here, it even serves a purpose, manages to follow through
on what we didn't realize at the time was foreshadowing: just as Tyler
Durden's Fight Club morphed into Project Mayhem, so does 'Jack's Fight Club
morph into something like a modern-day fable. And fables have morals,
messages. So does Fight Club. Watch, listen, don't let the
violence make you look way. It's worth every blood-slinging moment.

***1/2 (out of 4) "If you could fight one celebrity, who would you
fight?" That's what Edward Norton asks of Brad Pitt.
Their two perfect answers? Ernest Hemingway and William Shatner. Both
Hemingway and Shatner (as Captain Kirk) fought, almost as a Zen-like
expression of being human. That focus, that concentration of reality, is
what Fight Club is all about (although there's more to it than meets the
eye).
FIGHT CLUB's long setup is the funniest stuff Fincher has ever directed,
and it hits its corporate, materialistic target with better accuracy
than Mike Judge's OFFICE SPACE. 
Norton plays a cube-dweller/business traveler. His job, he narrates, is
to apply The Formula. Working for a major car maker, he weighs the cost
of a manufacturer's recall against the cost of a lawsuit. The lack of a
human element in the equation is turning him off his job.
He can't sleep nights and his doctor refuses to prescribe pills. Taking
an offhand remark seriously, he goes to a testicular cancer support
group and cries in the arms of Bob (Meat Loaf). That night, he sleeps. 
Crying at support groups becomes his sole means of emotional outlet, and
his sole cure for insomnia. He joins every support group he can find.
The details of this setup are hilarious, and the pacing is rapid-fire.
It's one of the funniest half-hours in any movie this year.
The movie changes tone and tempo a little when Brad Pitt is introduced.
The two meet on a plane and share their thoughts on the single-serving
lifestyle. They amiably trade business cards and go their separate ways. 
Norton arrives home from the airport to discover that his apartment has
been blown to bits. All his perfect furniture lies charred and
smoldering out front. He calls the only phone number he has --Pitt's.
The two get drunk together and agree that Norton has to stay with Pitt.
On their way out of the bar, Pitt insists that Norton hit him as hard as
he can. It is exhilarating for both of them, so they fight some more in
the parking lot. Eventually, they break it up and stagger to Pitt's flop
house to lick their wounds.
Fistfights become better than crying for Norton's insomnia. The two main
characters start fighting behind that same bar every week. Soon, a few
other guys join in and the whole endeavor is given a name: Fight Club.
Pitt takes Fight Club further. There's now a Tuesday and a Thursday
group that Pitt formed without Norton's knowing. It becomes so popular
that Norton begins to worry. Meanwhile, Pitt seems to relish the idea of
forming his own loyal little army. 
 The tone of the movie now changes drastically. What was funny has gone
too far. Norton wants to apply the brakes but Pitt won't stop. In fact,
he's accelerating, and now he even has a political agenda. In place of a
good laugh, the movie now gives us a dose of tension and horror.
Although David Ansen of Newsweek was on to something when he called it a
"mess," presumably referring to the multiple shifts in style and tone,
it really didn't seem to hurt the movie a bit. FIGHT CLUB is comedy,
action, horror/thriller, and eventually, romance, but the plot and
characters drive the transitions. Norton's dissatisfaction is funny, but
what helps cure it naturally leads to the action segment. Letting the
action escalate to extremes leads naturally to the horror/thriller
stage, and so on. So even if it seems "a mess," it still holds together
well.
FIGHT CLUB is great looking. That's not surprising coming from Fincher,
who has directed only solidly-stylized movies(SEVEN and THE GAME). The
opening sequence is a little like the great solar-system pull-back in
Contact, only this time, the "camera" pulls out of neurons and synapses
before coming out of a pore in Edward Norton's face. Later sequences
make great use of new camera/computer techniques that tightly control
the motion and speed of the images and motion on screen.
Thematically, FIGHT CLUB compares well to another recent "modern
malaise" movie: AMERICAN BEAUTY.
In AMERICAN BEAUTY, Kevin Spacey gives up on his pretty and
"successful," but unfulfilling life. He regresses to adolescence and
finds vivacious existence in drugs, cheerleaders, and muscle cars. In
FIGHT CLUB, Norton is suffering from the same vague dissatisfaction, and
finds solace in the reality of pain and the exhilaration of
physicalizing his weekly routine. (Both characters have strikingly
similar scenes in which they solve their "day job" problem.)
I really liked FIGHT CLUB and foundit lacking in almost no areas. The
acting was very good, the production looked great, and the story was
always interesting and entertaining.
Perhaps the biggest complaint is that it made the mistake every
"on-the-lam" movie makes: it overestimates the public's sympathy for the
anti-hero. A movie audience can sympathize with an on-screen rogue who
has the right sort of charm, but that just doesn't happen outside of a
movie. In the case of FIGHT CLUB, screenwriter Jim Uhls assumes that
LOTS of men would be interesting in joining Pitt's fistfighting army,
and I think he's wrong. There's one scene where it is particularly
distracting, which I can't mention without giving something away. Write
to me if you want to know.
But any reservations about the movie are more than made up for by its
wit, its energy, and its wonderful attention to detail. Fincher packed a
lot of stuff into FIGHT CLUB, and maybe that makes it a mess. I prefer
to call it "getting your money's worth."

Directed by: David Fincher
Written by: Chuck Palahniuk (novel), Jim Uhls
It's always easy to spot a director's style. Get about halfway through a film,
and all the tell tale signs are there. However, in David Fincher's case, the
signs can be spotted in the opening credits. From these bizzare credits and
character introductions, to the dark filming locations, to the unusual music,
Fincher is a master of foreboding, creepy atmospheres.
The story revolves around the narrator, Jack (Edward Norton), an insomniac
who's slowly dying thanks to his boring existence. Frequenting support groups
for illnesses he doesn't posess seems to aleviate his insomnia until he meets
Marla (Helena Botham Carter) ,who somehow ruins the experience by being a
fellow faker. Shortly thereafter he meets up with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), an
man who seems to be everything Jack always wished he could be. Together, Jack
and Tyler form a club where men who are bored with their lives go to beat each
other up. While things are going well with the club, Tyler seems to be forming
plans for escalating the club behind Jack's back.
David Fincher's previously well known works have been "Se7en" and "The Game",
which are both dark films which mess with ones mind. This latest venture into
the unusual is based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the primary message in "Fight
Club" seems to be that one should throw off the shackles of everyday life and
be all that one wants to be. This message is given in a story which, at first
glance, appears to be about nothing more than a bunch of guys beating each
other up every night. While there is certainly a lot of violence and an ungodly
amount of blood, there is also some wonderful dialogue, a few truly hilarious
scenes, and terrific acting all around.
To begin with, this movie is not even remotely appropriate for younger
audiences. There are more scenes here which show people being beaten to bloody,
barely living pulps than one can count. There are also a few gross out scenes
that really do their job quite well (almost too well as a matter of fact).
Swearing is rampant, and sex is rather prevalant throughout most of the movie.
So please, don't take any children to see this.
Now, my MPAA warning out of the way, on to the good stuff. For all the
one-liner fans out there, this movie is full of them. A great example would be
"On a long enough time-line, everyones survival rate is zero". In fact, the
dialogue is so witty, insightful, and humorous that it's a little difficult to
believe it's coming from the mouths of the characters involved here.
As for the acting, Edward Norton is terrific, as always, and it's entirely
possible he'll be in the running for a little gold statue on his mantel. Brad
Pitt, who has shown that he can do well when given the right roles (12 Monkeys,
Se7en) is absolutely hilarious in the role of the out of control Tyler. Helena
Botham Carter, who audiences would know best for her roles in "Mary Shelly's
Frankenstein" and "Mighty Aphrodite", is perfect as the rather disturbed third
party in this trio.
I don't want to give too much of this film away, because the plot twists are a
lot of the fun here. Suffice to say, you'll never see the end coming. To sum
up, for a fun, insightful, and very gruesome movie, catch "Fight Club". I fully
recommend it and award it four and a half stars. 
* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.

Fight Club - Directed by David Fincher.  
      There is a certain elegance and grace to Fight Club that is rarely seen
in movies today.  The scenes flow from one to another, the dialogue seems fresh
and realistic, and the whole movie comes off as being effortless.  That, of
course, is not true, a lot of work must of gone into the production of Fight
Club, and all of that work was work paid off.  Few movies have ever achieved
the greatness that Fight Club manages to pull off, it is a marvel of film
making.
     Watching Fight Club is an adventure in itself.  Sitting in your seat
noticing all the little details in this film is what makes it so great.  I
couldn't help but think to myself how far the movie-making industry has come in
order to make movies like this.  This is by no means a conventional movie, it
took the path less traveled and made something truly unique, with lots of
original scenes, (aka the scene where "cigarette burns" are explained to the
audience).  Fight Club definatley has a lot of depth and care given to each
scene, and this makes for a more enjoyable movie experience.  Watching Fight
Club for the first time is like being introduced to a whole new world, a
temporary environment where you can just let yourself go and be a part of
something, and when it ends, reality comes crashing down.
     There is very little else to say about this movie, it is almost an escape
for the viewer.  There are so many little things that I would love to talk
about, however half of the fun of this movie is to find them out for yourself.

        âAction is the adolescent antidepressant.â?
If a bunch of guys getting together to beat each other up is so
therapeutic, then Mike Tyson should be the most well adjusted
fellow on the planet.  That he so palpably isnât exposes the
central flaw of both this movie and the silly and pretentious
book itâs based on. Namely, itâs idiotic.
I wonder that a smart and talented actor of Edward Nortonâs
caliber would have anything to do with this foolish film. 
Raised in affluence and Yale educated, itâs as if heâs ashamed
of his civilized roots; âFight Clubâ? is the third
testosterone-soaked movie in a row that heâs done. 
âRoundersâ? was about how guys donât let their buds down, as
Matt Damon abandons school, girlfriend, and Gamblers
Anonymous to help a cheat named Worm.  In the fine
âAmerican History X,â? Norton got pumped, tattooed, and crazy
as a California neo-Nazi.  Women, to the extent they appear at
all in these three movies, are there to get boinked, dumped, or
in the case of  âAHXâ?, to have pot roast shoved down their
throats when they mouth off.  I think itâs time Norton made a
romantic comedy.
In âFight Club,â? Nortonâs (nameless) character has a lousy
corporate job and chronic insomnia.  For the latter, he joins
support groups for diseases he doesnât have: various cancers,
blood parasites, etc.  These sessions all end in group hugs and a
good cry, and after a good cry he can sleep.  At one of these
groups he meets Bob, an obese former weight lifter. The
steroids Bob took to compete gave him testicular cancer, and
now, ball-less, heâs developing âbitch tits.â?  This feminizing of
Bob is all very symbolic; itâs also very crude and heavy
handed.  And, incredibly, itâs supposed to be .
Support group emotional vampirism doesnât fix Nortonâs
insomnia for long, however.  Itâs all ruined when a woman
shows up and crowds him out (Helena Bonham Carter, here
looking like a grown-up version of Wednesday Addams.)  He
stops going to these church-basement hug fests.  What kind of
existence is it for men, anyway, getting all warm and fuzzy and
crying on each otherâs necks. Real men donât need therapy. 
They need a good fist fight instead.
Real men are strong and silent.  Especially silent.  The first
rule of fight club is you donât talk about fight club.  The second
rule, ditto.  Real men go silently about the business of beating
each other bloody with bare knuckles and when theyâre
through, they nod solemnly and shake hands in their new found
brotherhood.
Oh, brother.  Actually, most fights Iâve seen consist of lots of
yelling, swearing, and threatening, and little or no hitting. 
Hitting hurts.  And it usually ends in anything but happy
feelings all around.
âFight Clubâ? is silly male wish fulfillment.  If you like WWF
Wrestling, youâll love âFight Club.â?  
It gets even sillier when the Space Monkey urban guerrillas
show up, with their boot camp âMore P.E., drill sergeant!â?
nonsense.  Real men, you see, crave discipline.  
Yes, I know âFight Clubâ? isnât meant to be taken too literally. 
Like âThe Blair Witch Projectâ? and the aforementioned pro
wrestling, itâs all kinda a big joke.  Itâs part of the Gen X
sensibility (Norton has said he prefers the label âthe whatever
generationâ?) to make statements they donât really believe. 
How that differs from simple irresponsibility is beyond my
ken.  But I do know that seeing a tall, Aryan Brad Pitt putting a
pistol to the head of a young, cowering Asian convenience
store clerk, terrorizing him supposedly for his own good, is a
very disturbing image.  One thatâs eerily reminiscent of
Nortonâs âAmerican History X,â? only with the sympathy laid
on the wrong side.

I am an amateur movie reviewer.  "Amateur", of course, implies two
things -- that I am not very good, and that I am not getting paid.  (All
those who wish to remedy this status, either by telling me how wonderful
I am or by giving me money, are free to do so.)
But being an amateur, I have certain freedoms.  I do not have to see
every movie, whether it's one of those arthouse flicks that gets hyped
on NPR or one of those mindless teen slasher movies.  I do not have to
review every bad movie I see, which meant that I did not have to
chronicle the multiple sillinesses in, let's say, The Thirteenth
Warrior.  (Or, as they're calling it at the studio, the Chapter
Thirteenth Warrior.)
But most importantly, if a movie is really important for me, if it
really speaks to me in meaningful ways, if I can't write a coherent
sentence about it because of the flood of feelings that come washing
through me, I don't have to write a review.  I tried for weeks to write
a Good Will Hunting review before I figured out that I could stop and go
to the next review.  I didn't have to search my emotional thesaurus to
fight the right words to describe how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's
script affected me.
And I thought, there for a while, that I wouldn't be able to write a
Fight Club review.  I had the first paragraph done, but I got stuck.
"Fight Club is a movie about men and manliness," I wrote, right after I
first saw the movie.  "It is about blood and courage and recklessness.
It celebrates the raw power of men beating the stuffing out of each
other.  It is a macho, savage movie with scene after scene of
bloodletting and violence.  These things are all true, to some degree,
but they do not encompass the movie.  The truest thing about Fight Club
is its resonance, the way it tugs on the little harp strings in your
chest that let you know when something  is... is..."
I thought, there for a while, that Fight Club had a capital-M Message.
A message specifically tailored for bored 30-year-old urban professional
children of divorce.  A message that would ring in our ears and inspire
us. Somewhere in all that high-sounding bombast ("Our Great War is a
spiritual war.  Our Great Depression is our lives.") there was something
that was talking to us.  Something that would be the final word for all
of us lost, soulless Generation X slackers.
The key scene in Fight Club comes very early on in the movie, and is, in
the way, the pebble that starts the avalanche of silliness.  Jack the
Narrator (Ed Norton) starts the movie with a description of his life as
a thirtysomething cog in a corporate machine.  Cogs in machines don't
get to sleep, and neither does Jack, whose insomnia leaves him stumbling
through life.  Jack goes to see his doctor, begging for sleeping pills.
The doctor says no.  (Incredibly, he doesn't seem motivated by any
desire to save Kaiser's prescription plan a couple bucks.)  The doctor
tells Jack that he doesn't need pills, that he's really not going
through any real pain.  Go visit the testicular cancer survivor's
support group, the doc says, and see what real pain is like.
For a long while, I was mad at the doctor.  How dare he be so callous?
Just because Jack (or me) has trouble sleeping, or is depressed about
work and life and the quality of the furniture in our apartments,
doesn't mean that our struggles and our problems and our sense of
emptiness can be dismissed?  Just because our pain isn't as severe as
people with cancer or parents of murdered children or Rwandan refugees
doesn't mean that it's not important, doesn't it?  Doesn't it?
What I think the doctor is trying to tell Jack is two simple, universal
truths:
1.  Everybody's got problems.
2.  Everybody's got to deal with their own problems.
Jack learns the first part of this lesson, but not the second part.  He
begins to infiltrate support groups for diseases he doesn't have,
sucking up the grief of others like a sponge.  It helps him to sleep,
somehow, and gives him an emotional release.  (Thankfully, it gives the
audience some satiric fun, too.)  But it's not a real solution, as is
demonstrated when another faker (Helena Bonham-Carter) starts haunting
the same groups.  And when the real world hits Jack with a real and very
personal catastrophe, he can't use the twelve-steps to sidestep his
pain.
At this point, Fight Club opens the door for Brad Pitt's nihilistic
maniac Tyler Durden.  After a brief meeting on an airplane, Tyler and
Jack somehow form a relationship as balanced as the yin and the yang on
Jack's departed coffee table.  Tyler doesn't have any trouble sleeping.
He's a soap-making entrepreneur (you learn a lot more about the
soap-making process than you want to), outside the system, outside
materialism, outside any sense of right or wrong.
Tyler, himself a walking sartorial sight gag, lives in a trashed-out
nightmare of a house that represents a fantastic step forward in the
lively art of set design.  This house would cause Kosovar refugees to
turn up their noses and ask for a nice, dry tent.  Martha Stewart would
go mad with horror and fear.  This is the kind of house that would make
Bob Vila drop his tool belt and sadly walk away, frustrated by the
magnitude of the opportunity.
Together, Tyler and Durden found Fight Club, where men of all shapes and
sizes can pummel each other senselessly.  I said earlier that I thought
that Fight Club was about men and manliness, which is 100% wrong.  It's
about boys and boyishness.  Men fight, but they fight for reasons, be it
honor or protection of the weak or a multi-million-dollar pay-per-view
purse.  Fight Club is fighting for the sake of fighting, just the way it
took place on the Johnson Elementary playground.  The only thing
different is that no one is stealing anyone else's lunch money.
Fight Club eventually develops into Project Mayhem, which is more
childish but is childishly creative as well.  The men of Fight Club set
up code words and play soldier and get to stay up all night smashing
things.  The audience can, and does, take some juvenile pleasure in
seeing the world's biggest bowling ball run over a Starbucks, but that's
it.  No one in Project Mayhem is dealing with their problems, they're
blowing them up instead.
Fight Club itself has problems if its own that it doesn't deal with,
either.  Fight Club is as nonsensical as a history lesson from Pat
Buchanan or (to be nonpartisan) grand jury testimony from Bill Clinton.
It is lavishly overproduced, with baroque touches like talking penguins
and subliminal film splicing.  Everything is laid on too thick, from the
incessant, whiny narration to the blood flowing from Edward Norton's
nose to Brad Pitt's tough-guy act to Helena Bonham Carter's eyeshadow.
The whole movie screams of excess. (The screaming, unfortunately, is
loud enough to drown out a solid performance by Ed Norton and a dead-on
Winona Ryder impression by Helena Bonham Carter.)
The final verdict on Fight Club is a split decision.  There's a lot to
like and admire about the moviemaking skill that all parties (even Brad
Pitt) display.  If all you're looking for is a fun, mindless movie,
Fight Club may be for you.  But just as there's a message in Fight Club
-- a message that none of the actors heed -- there's also a danger.  The
danger in Fight Club, like the danger in nihilism itself, is that some
people will actually take it seriously.

"So how does a conservative movie reviewer, who doesn't want to spoil
the movie, write a review? The same way he takes the lamb chop from
rottweiller -- carefully. Another way is to fill two-thirds of the
column with irrelevant woolgathering about other topics so that you
only have room for a paragraph for the real review."  -- Jonah Goldberg

   "Fight Club" comes to us at just the right political time. 
The media are abuzz and the classrooms are a-whirring with
ideas about the current controversial du jour: Do violent
movies cause actual violence, or do movies simply reflect the
true cause of violence--our very society?  David Fincher,
whose imaginative output has included "The Game," comes
out on the latter side.  His new epic drama, "Fight Club,"
holds that the soul-deadening jobs that we hold with corrupt
corporations coupled with the daily pummeling we receive
from corporate advertising are enough to drive quite a few
people not just angry, but downright mad.  Because of the
emptiness of the daily, hollow grind, we seek solace by
buying things that promise redemption--which we do not
receive.  We're bombarded by ads depicting models with
perfect bodies and by commercials pitching ways we can fill
up our wanting spirits--buy furniture, buy gym memberships,
drape yourself in Calvin Klein.  (Apparently, escaping to
movie theaters does not qualify as fatuous.) 
   Watching this film--to its credit a you'll-love-it-or-hate-it sort
of experience--I couldn't help thinking of a play on a similar
theme, "Equus."  In Peter Shaffer's conception, Martin Dysart,
a middle-aged English psychiatrist, treats a disturbed
adolescent, Alan Strang.  Among Alan's hobbies is riding a
horse at midnight, as bareback as the animal.  Psychotic
though the lad may be, he impresses the doctor with his
vitality, his lack of inhibition, which he pits against his own
dull, conventional holidays consisting of a couple of weeks of
lazing at a middle-class resort.
   If the listless people created in Chuck Palahniuk's novel did
nothing more singular than ride horses at the witching hour,
Fincher's film, which gives visual heft to Jim Uhls's
adaptation, would lack the intense, visceral power that holds
the audience in its thrall for all of its 139 minutes.  But
whereas "Equus," an effective play written for the limited
leeway allowed by the legitimate stage, is thought-provoking,
"Fight Club" makes full use of the benefits of the big screen. 
Its dialogue is razor-keen, allowing Uhls's script to deride the
usual punching-bags of contemporary satire: consumerism
and corruption.  More important, the movie takes command of
the screen and sound system, embellishing the din of
punches viciously thrown along with rough sex clumsily and
happily indulged in by two of its lead personalities.
   The film opens on a stark scene.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)
has plunged a gun inside the mouth of Jack (Edward Norton
whose narration frequently punctuates the story), announcing
an imminent disaster to occur in a nameless, largely stylized
city.  Fincher flashes back to Jack at work as a consultant
with a major automobile manufacturer.  His job, which takes
him frequently into the field, involves investigating accidents
that have befallen owners of his company's auto.  In an
effective piece of anti-corporation satire, Jack describes
company policy to a passenger sitting adjacent to him on a
flight.  The corporation has a formula. If the expected awards
that the courts bestow on the hapless occupants suing the
company will exceed the company's cost of recalling the
flawed vehicles, the corporation will announce an expensive
recall.  If not, the car remains on the road.
   Jack, disgusted with his job and his insipid boss (Zach
Grenier), is plagued with insomnia.  A doctor dismisses his
patient's agony, encouraging Jack instead to go to a support
group for victims of testicular cancer survivors so that he will
see what real pain is like.  Jack becomes addicted to groups
of this kind and, in the movie's most humorous scenes, he--
and a fellow faker, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter)--
visit a different group each night for entertainment.  On one
business flight, Jack meets colorful soap salesman Tyler
Durden, who urges Jack to chuck his cramped, insomnia-
ridden, bourgeois life-style, become a squatter in a rundown
house in a dingy, toxic section of town, and end his
enslavement to things.  After Jack and Tyler engage in a
physical brawl with each other, Jack finds that he has been
reborn.  He feels peculiarly free.  The two devise a grandiose
plan to set up a fight club, whose members would meet one
or more nights each week to beat one another to a pulp.  In
one scene that could cause some patrons to bolt from the
theater nauseated, Jack smashes up a pretty-boy who has
joined the group so fervently that the young man, Angel Face
(Jared Leto), will presumably have to change his nickname.
   David Fincher has most effectively realized the movie's
tagline, "Mischief, Mayhem, Soap."  As chapters of this fight
club expand throughout the country, Fincher allows the
audience to imagine the movie as a metaphor for the rise of
Fascism.  Fascism thrives on society's discontents.  Hitler's
and Mussolini's grand designs were put into motion when
groups of thugs disgruntled by economic woes and their
status on society's outskirts donned brown shirts and black
shirts and began terrorizing those they believed to be the
cause of their problems.  Fincher seems to say that Fascist
nihilism could arise even in the prosperous United States as
groups of people on society's fringes, together with those
who are dissatisfied with their workaday and social lives,
band together to destroy the forces they perceive as their
enemies.  How else to explain the recent tragedy at
Columbine High School, where privileged, intelligent kids,
shunned by their classmates and relegated to the condition of
outsiders, gunned down those they felt to be their
antagonists?
   Filmed and acted with assurance, "Fight Club" should for
the first time allow the public to see Brad Pitt as far more
than a pretty boy.  In his first truly visceral role, Pitt is the heir
to Malcolm McDowell's misfit in Stanley Kubrick's masterful
"A Clockwork Orange," while Edward Norton, marvelous in a
variety of roles from a white supremacist in Tony Kaye's
"American History X" to a charming romantic in Woody
Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You," inhabits the dark role of
a malcontent with astonishing depth.  Helena Bonham Carter
gives a rousing, over-the-top performance as the cynical
neurotic who is disgusted by Jack's brutality and enraptured
by Tyler's sexual prowess.  Fincher's timing is as surreal as
the film, flashing some scenes across the screen so quickly
(such as Jack's appearance at a sickle-cell support group)
that the audience knows it had better not blink.
   The kinetic style of "Fight Club" will appeal to the younger
members of the audience, the social satire to the more
sophisticated.  Predictably, many social and religious
conservatives will be appalled, the former convinced that its
violence will induce savagery outside the theater, the latter
offended by its nihilism.  Even those bearing no particular
ideology will be divided neatly down the middle, some
confused by what they could (wrongly) consider the
emptiness of the story, others gratified by its brawn, courage,
and energy.  A vigorous movie will do just that: offend some
mightily while gratifying others.  Show me a "likable" movie
and I'll show you a relaxing, banal, made-for-TV drama. 
"Fight Club" combines a physical rush with an intelligent
script and features wonderful performances of sharply-defined
characters.  These qualities should command the attention of
the Academy come nomination time.

     Invoking memories of THE MATRIX, TWELVE MONKEYS, CRASH, and
AMERICAN BEAUTY, FIGHT CLUB has had a lot of hype behind it for close to
a year now.  Is it deserved?  I'm still trying to figure that one out.
I saw the film 6 hours ago.  I liked what I saw.  I'm just not sure
*what* I saw any more.
     FIGHT CLUB is the story of Jack (Norton), a mild-mannered day-job
schlub/insomniac.  To combat his lack of sleep, Jack takes comfort in
various support groups for ailments he doesn't have, where he finds a
sudden freedom from life's pressures, surrounded by people on the verge
of recovery or the verge of death.  Soon enough, Jack becomes `addicted'
to the support groups, but things get worse when the freakish Marla
(Carter) tries to take over his space  obviously getting off on the
same thrill as Jack.
     Soon, Jack is back where he started, and on a flight home from yet
another business trip, he encounters Tyler (Pitt), a nutty character
reminiscent of The Mad Hatter, William S. Burroughs, and The Unabomber
all rolled up into one.  When Jack arrives at home, he finds his condo
mysteriously blown up, and he ends up moving in with Tyler in a craphole
of a house.  Tyler takes Jack down a road of self-discovery, mainly
through violence, and together they found Fight Club, an underground
bareknuckled boxing society  a big step beyond `self-help.'
     As the movie progresses, so does the darkness of Fight Club.  Its
membership skyrockets, and its extracurricular activities turn
subversive.  The explosive ending introduces a twist a la THE SIXTH
SENSE, which finally helps the movie make some sense.
     Along the way, FIGHT CLUB is quite a ride.  Director Fincher
(SEVEN) knows atmosphere, and atmosphere is what you get, starting right
with the opening credits, which feature a ride through the human brain.
Norton narrates the entire film, which puts you right inside his head.
The acting is superb, and Meat Loaf is quite hilarious as an enormous
man with no testicles and two giant breasts (I'd explain, but...).
     FIGHT CLUB is not going to appeal to everyone the way SIXTH SENSE
did.  It's bloody and violent (hence the name), but it's as unique a
film as you're likely to see this year.  I don't wanna see any hate mail
about this review... or else we're gonna have to take this outside.

He has it all - the American dream. A 15th storey glass-fronted condo,
expensive furniture, highly paid job with career advancement possibilities
and a wardrobe full of designer clothing. And jet he is not happy. He feels
nothing. The minutes are ticking by, and form hours, days, months, years.
Nothing happens. Surrounded by emptiness, he doesn't feel alive. A chance
encounter with the mysterious Tyler Durden opens his eyes to the possibility
that he can live a life without material goods. The two begin to fight each
other, once a week, for emotional release through physical pain and
suffering. There is no better way to feel alive, than to taste death. Life
has suddenly got a meaning. Soon others find out about this new way of
therapy and the Fight Club is born. After a little while, every major city
gets its own fight club, but that's only the first step in Tyler's complex
plan. But then the events start moving out of control and the two words -
fight club, mean now urban terrorism..
This is more or less the plot in David Fincher's dark and disturbing film.
Off course there's much more to it. "Fight Club" plays on several levels,
generates many provoking thoughts and is completely open for interpretation.
The plot itself (based on the novel by Chuck Palancniuk) should be enough to
make an impression, but Fincher's gritty and innovative style and the Dust
Brothers' acidic chemical cocktail of dark, mood-enchancing tunes, turns
this film into a macabre, visual masterpiece.
The film's main person and nameless narrator is played by Edward Norton. As
always Nortondelivers an exceptional performance, flowing into the role of a
cynical, but mild-minded young man. This character is probably like 90% of
this world's population. Tyler Durden is the black hole of his soul; he is
everything our narrator isn't, and at the same time everything he wanted to
be. This interesting contrast is shown in everything - from clothes and
visual appearance to thoughts and feelings. Tyler's complex character is
portrayed by the ever popular Brad Pitt. After 25 movies, this is his
strongest performance. And believe me, he is really impressive. Helena Boham
Carter is the only female lead in this film, who plays a woman that attends
support group meetings purely for the entertainment value. She gets
unwillingly involved in the macabre and strange events coming one after
another. In addition to this talented trio, the supporting cast, consisting
of almost unknown actors, is equally wonderful, including Meat Loaf and
Jared Leto .
Even before the release of "Fight Club" everyone were talking about
Fincher's graphical portrayal of violence. There is no point to deny that
"Fight Club" is violent movie. The brutal scenes of blood and bones smashed
will certainly burn into your mind. But the purpose of this horrific
bloodbath is not to entertain or amuse, but to make a powerful statement.
Every member of Fight Club is a victim of a dehumanizing and cynical
society. There is one point in the film when Tyler asks: "How much can you
know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?". Pain gives these men
a sense of individuality by exploring their most primitive, barbaric
instincts. Violence is here a depiction of the bestial nature of man.
Fincher really overcomes himself as he is revealing each new turn in a
spiral that descends into darkness and madness. "Fight Club" is not a
"politically correct" film. It doesn't show the world through rose-colored
classes, it shocks and provokes because of its open depiction of the
horrifying reality. Issues like fascism and the whole Nazi ideology is here
shown as a metaphor for the rise of national socialism. What's making this
film even more interesting is the element of satire and macabre humor. This
is a very difficult combination, and it works. The director's surreal style
allows scenes, that under normal surcomstances would not fit in a serious
and dramatic film like this one. In one scene, our narrator's appartement is
displayed like a page in a furniture catalog, complete with text blurbs
superimposed on the screen describing the various pieces. Add some brilliant
voice-over comentaries (by Norton), and you'll get a twice as effective
scene, revealing much more about our social image, than the creepy
conversations in "Se7en".
"Fight Club" is a heavy, surreal experience that really gets under the skin,
refusing to be ignored. Both Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange",
"Dr.Jekkyl and Mr.Hyde" and "American Psycho" come to mind, while watching
this aggressive fist fight of a movie. This is actually the only film so
far, that can challenge "Eyes Wide Shut" ; and like Kubrick's last
masterpiece, this is a film that offers too much to absorb under one
screening.
So what is this film about? Is it about troubled and self-destructive youth,
the soullessness of the corporate world, or the role of love and friendship
in modern society? The answer you have to find for yourself, but one thing
is certain: "Fight Club" is a lasting and forceful emotional statement about
modern society.

Hear or read a story about _Fight_Club_, and chances are it's about
violence--that is, the film's amount and glorification of it.  Indeed,
there is a fair amount of brutality on display in David Fincher's
adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel (after all, the film is called
_Fight_Club_), but that's just a mean to an end.  And the end--in every
sense of the word--is but one of the many striking blows this
electrifying, electrified film deals its unsuspecting audience.  Physical
violence may give the initial sting, but it's the film's psychological
violence that leaves the lasting impression.
For all the carnage on display, what comes as the greatest shock while
watching _Fight_Club_ is realizing that the film is a _comedy_--albeit a
dark and very cynical one at that (and what else could it be, coming from
_Se7en_ and _The_Game_ maestro Fincher?).  The tone is set by our
nameless, Everyman narrator (Edward Norton, award-worthy as usual) whose
boredom with his mind-numbing job and life leads to a perpetual case of
insomnia.  To fill his sleepless nights, he indulges in some strange
addictions: first, shopping from catalogs, in particular those of IKEA;
then attending support groups for people with ailments he never has and
likely never will suffer himself.  But when he discovers another
unafflicted person, one Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, cast way
against type and delivering), making the rounds at his meetings, he finds
himself without a worthwhile time-consuming vice.
The ultimate addiction comes after the narrator returns home from a
business trip to find that his apartment and all his precious
catalog-purchased items have been lost in a mysterious explosion.  With
nowhere else to turn, he impulsively calls homemade soap salesman Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), whom he met on the returning flight.  After having
perhaps too many beers, the two get into a playful but no less brutal
fistfight outside of a bar, catching the attention and inciting the
involvement of a few other patrons.  Thus begins the strange underground
society of senseless organized beatings known as Fight Club.
Which leads to numerous scenes of men graphically pounding each other
into a blood-drenched pulp, which, in turn, has led to charges that
_Fight_Club_ glorifies violence.  There is some evidence supporting that
argument: the fisticuffs fuel our emasculated narrator's spiritual
liberation; and Fincher, never one to shy away from grisliness in
previous films, doesn't pass up an opportunity to linger over every last
gory detail.  It is overkill, no doubt--but that's precisely the joke. 
The violence is so extreme as to be over-the-top, much like everything
else in this film--to ridiculous effect.  The fight scenes are really not
all too different opening sections of the film, which detail the
narrator's goods-obsessed lifestyle in often literal detail (at one
point, prices and product descriptions appear in his apartment out of
thin air, turning it into a living catalog page).  In doing so, Fincher
underscores the absurdity of that life--and in the violent scenes, all
the blood just drives home the idiocy behind the
beat-or-get-beaten-to-self-fulfillment philosophy.  
As the underground Fight Club mutates into the very visible Project
Mayhem under Tyler's guidance, the narrator comes to see the light and
sets out to stop his partner-in-crime, which turns out to be much more
easily said than done, but not in the way he expects.  This point of the
story has also been debated about (and will leave a number of audiences
talking), with the negative comments calling it a cheap trick.  Far from
it.  More than just a powerful reinforcement of the film's theme of how
the rigidity of society reins in the freedom to express and simply be who
one is, it also ties into Fincher and scripter Jim Uhls' slyest joke.  I
won't give it away, but it's related to an idea Tyler expresses where
identity itself is a product, with public figures being the walking
billboards for an unattainable ideal.  In that respect, the casting of
Pitt--who does a terrific job in any respect--reveals itself to be
especially canny.
_Fight_Club_ is about submission, but not the bloody submission many men
pummel each other into through the course of the film.  It is, however,
about a different type of submission--that of unique human identity to
the homogenization of consumer-driven culture.  The brave, subversive,
and wholly intoxicating way in which Fincher makes his point is far more
shocking than any fight scene in this stunning and important cinematic
work.

FIGHT CLUB is Finchers third movie outing and with every film, he seems to
out-do himself in style and technical filming. In SEVEN, his dark shots sets
the standard for possibly one of the moodiest Hollywood film ever. In THE
GAME (with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn), Fincher continues his penchant
for technical mood only this time, blended with action sequences. With FIGHT
CLUB, he explores CGI and the impressive Virtual Camera (used to much
success in THE MATRIX) interlaced with his trademark stylized dark shots.
The story revolves first-perspective, around Jack (Norton), who has been
suffering insomnia for quite some time. In his desperate state to solve this
problem which is affecting his career and social life, he enrols into
various support-groups. The problem is, the support groups do not support
directly his problem; he involves himself in groups supporting
testicular-cancer, AIDS and many others. Somehow, the talking and the crying
involved in the groups helped him to sleep well at night. Before long, they
became his addiction; attending them everyday after work. However, the
effect disappeared when he discovers another person, Marla Singer (Carter),
who attends all these groups as well, apparently with similar intentions.
He befriends Tyler Durden (Pitt) during one of his business trips and
unknowingly makes a friends who will change his life forever. Tyler is into
soap making, well at least thats one of his weird forte. Jacks life takes
a turn when Tyler asks him to punch him. From then on, they meet up
regularly, and well, just simply punch each others guts out. Soon, they
develop a following and when they group became too big to just hold a
slugfest in the open, they decide to take it underground. Thus FIGHT CLUB is
created. The first rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT
CLUB, second rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB,
third rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB
FIGHT CLUB is simply so bizarre, its hard to believe that audience can
actually immerse so easily in it. Its pure fun. Brutal..but fun. Superb
acting from Norton (fresh from AMERICAN HISTORY X) and Pitt. Norton once
again demonstrates his acting versatility, from buff (AMERICAN HISTORY X) to
geek in FIGHT CLUB. Pitts neurotic Tyler really scared the shit out of me
but still, very adorable. Meat Loafs lactating bodybuilder role is
unforgettable. Fincher does it yet again, you just cant imagine another
director doing this movie any better.
FIGHT CLUB is fresh, funny and brutal. A definite must-see for all!

David Fincher's latest cold, bleak, depressing masterpiece is a 139-
min. adrenaline rush. It's a film that stabs you in the heart with a
rusty knife and then sprays it with 100% proof alcohol. It's one that
goes straight for the jugular and leaves you gasping for its entire
run. And did I mention how funny this macabre comedy is?
Based on Chuck Palahniuk's intensely provocative first novel of the
same name and armed with innovative visual techniques, jaw-droppingly
superb performances from its stars, and a darkly satirical & original
screenplay, `Fight Club' proves that it's one of the best films of the
decade.
Hype for this film has been incredibly high and so have the stakes for
everyone involved. The book has become a cult classic and rightfully
so. Having read the novel myself, I can honestly say the movie is as
good, if not better than the book. The brilliant wordplay, the
monologues, its originality, all has been brought to life and Fincher
has taken them to the next level after that. David Fincher's career
hits a peak with this film, with `Fight Club' he becomes the best
director at combining style and substance and never has it been done
this well. Fincher has also gotten the best performances out of all his
players.
Edward Norton gives another superior performance as the everyman
Narrator and once again proves he is one of the most versatile actors
working in Hollywood today. Not only that, but Brad Pitt is back, going
all out in anti-mainstream mode as Tyler Durden, delivering his best
performance to date. And Helena Bonham Carter portrays her sardonic
character with such deadpan panache that if she doesn't get an Oscar
nomination in February; I'll be bitching for a very long time.
`Fight Club' starts out about a group of yuppies that start a club
where each week they take their aggressions out on each other by
fighting. However, that's only the beginning. Later on, Tyler takes
Fight Club up a notch with Project Mayhem, a terrorist group that
rebels against society in many ways. Their antics get more and more
extreme, right up until its tremendous first-rate climax. Unlike other
recent releases, the film's ending is very satisfying. `Fight Club'
doesn't end abruptly with no conclusion, it doesn't end with a
predictable twist, it ends with a nice and twisted dark ending.
To tell you any more about the plot would be wrong of me, so stop
reading any reviews and go see `Fight Club', the best film I've seen
all year.

David Fincher's (The Game) latest film begins at the end - in a
high-rise office building where protagonist and narrator Jack (Edward
Norton, American History X) is asked, with a pistol jammed into his
mouth, if he has any last words.  The gunman is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,
Meet Joe Black), who explains to Jack that he has planted explosives in
several nearby buildings with the intent of leveling several city
blocks.  We know this is the end of the film, and Jack's story is
revealed through his nightmarish narrative flashback.
There is a reason we never learn Jack's name; he's supposed to represent
an anonymous 30-year-old single white professional male - the kind that
is slowly realizing that they have no purpose in life, other than
toiling away in a white-button-down-shirt job all day and watching
sitcoms from the comfort of their IKEA couch at night.  They are the
middle generation  raised by women and without either a Great War or a
Great Depression.  Their great depression is existence.
Once Jack takes us to the beginning of his tale, we learn that he works
for a major automobile manufacturer, investigating accidents caused by
faulty design to determine whether a recall would be cost effective for
the company.  He also suffers from insomnia, a condition that his doctor
refuses to cure via prescription medication.  The doctor suggests
depressed Jack get more exercise and tells him to cheer up, implying
that he check out a support group at St. Christopher's Church to see the
real misery of the human condition.
The support group is for men that have been gelded due to testicular
cancer.  Jack is paired up with Robert Paulsen (Meat Loaf, Black Dog) a
giant man with giant `bitch-tits' as a result of female hormone
treatments.  After a weepy Robert pours his heart out to him, Jack gets
the best night of sleep he's had in months.  As a result, Jack becomes
somewhat of a support-group junkie, attending meetings for victims of
tuberculosis, sickle-cell anemia and melanoma, among other afflictions.
After a year of touring the anguish and sorrow circuit, Jack meets two
people that will change his life forever.  One is Marla Singer (Helena
Bonham Carter, Theory of Flight), a suicidal woman he notices at all of
the support group meetings.  The second is Tyler, a soap salesman with
extensive knowledge in explosives that Jack meets on an airplane.
Because of a fire in his condo, Jack takes up residence with Tyler, who
lives in an immense dilapidated house in an abandoned part of the city.
As Jack and Tyler bond, they discover that pummeling each other is a
great therapeutic way to unload all of the pressure of being young white
men.  They regularly hold fistfights each Saturday outside a dive bar
called Lou's Tavern and soon are joined by other disillusioned young
white men.  Eventually, the `Fight Club' moves into the dirt-floored
basement of Lou's Tavern and is subjected to several rules (you probably
already know the first one).
While Jack is thrilled at the idea of Fight Club and all it represents,
he suspects Tyler of deviant ulterior motives.  Just who is Tyler Durden
and why do all of these complete strangers seem to become his disciples
so quickly?  How did he manage to score Marla as a sex partner?  Jack
also learns that Fight Club is open on nights other than Saturday and
has heard rumors that Durden has opened branches in other cities, as
well.
As their relationship fizzles, so does Jack's remaining semblance of a
life.  He comes to work disheveled, bloodied and without a tie.  He
fantasizes about Marla and he grows increasingly suspicious of Tyler's
nihilistic and mysterious goals of `freeing' men from the drudgery of
their lives.
Fight Club is one heck of a brutally graphic film.  Visually, it's
amazing, with Fincher pulling no punches in creating the gritty
underworld of indifferent men.  The story is based on Chuck Palahniuk's
novel, who allegedly wrote it long-hand while working as a truck
mechanic.  Palahniuk's story will leave some people slack-jawed, some
nauseous, some cold and some afraid to walk through the theater parking
lot to get to their cars.  Thanks to Fincher's direction (as well as his
production team  editor Jim Haygood and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth
from The Game) you can almost feel every punch thrown in the film.
Although there are plenty of fantastic scenes in the film, two in
particular have the misfortune of following recent pictures with similar
content - American Beauty and The Sixth Sense.  I won't say what the
similarities are, but after you see Fight Club, it will be pretty
obvious.  Despite this bad luck, Fight Club is still a fantastic flick
and almost seems ahead of its time in terms of social message and
violent content.

STARRING:  Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
DIRECTOR:  David Fincher
WRITTEN BY:  Jim Uhls (based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk)
Not since Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers has there been a movie
this incendiary, and not since David Cronenberg has a so-called
mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine
line between pointed social commentary and outright social
irresponsibility.  While Fincher's films have never suffered from a
lack of shock value (his major character killings in both Alien 3 and
Seven are fine examples), Fight Club marks the distillation of his
pitch-black comedic sensibility (see 1997's The Game) into something
like a definitive statement.
Jack (Norton, acting as both narrator and protagonist) is your typical
cubicle clone, whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly
incurable insomnia.  On the offhand advice of a doctor, he sits in on
group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to
testicular cancer.  Here he meets Bob (Marvin Lee Aday, AKA Meat
Loaf), a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia.
Strangely, the release he finds while sobbing on Bob's breasts allows
him to sleep at night, at least until a fellow group-therapy "tourist"
named Marla Singer (Carter) comes along to ruin things for him,
forcing a grudging compromise that recalls Monty Python in its dark
hilarity.  Later, he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman with a
decidedly subversive outlook on life.  One night, after his IKEA-
furnished condo explodes (don't ask-- you'll just have to see the
movie, awright?), he is goaded by Tyler into a fight, and damned if it
doesn't feel good.  It is pure, raw existence, a brief moment of
clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in
comparison.  He moves into Tyler's squalid abandoned mansion, and they
form the titular organization, an underground therapy group where men
bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules, the first two of
which are "Don't Talk About Fight Club."  Armed with charisma and an
attractive anti-corporate philosophy, Tyler assumes leadership of the
burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end McEmployees.
Resentment creeps into Jack's heart, made worse by the fact that Tyler
is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated Marla.  Funded by a
frivolous lawsuit, Tyler begins molding his devotees into an army
dedicated to mischief and mayhem.  Their initially juvenile pranks
(like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads) quickly evolve
into something more like sedition, and Jack fears that things have
gone sour.
It is after this point, when you are plenty uncomfortable and
wondering just how far Fincher will go to say something original, that
the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist.  It is so contrived-- and
so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which
follows (including the ending) becomes far less interesting.  It's a
major (though not fatal) flaw, and for a director as notoriously
unpredictable as Fincher, it feels like a cop-out.
Fight Club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people.  In the
early going, it has a downright dangerous feel; it seems to be saying
that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul, and this
is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take
from it.  I'll be mightily surprised if imitation Fight Clubs don't
spring up here and there, and I'll be even more amazed if Fincher
isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are
currently after Oliver Stone.  They needn't bother, because Fight Club
is less a message movie than Fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke.
Tyler Durden, for all his Dionysian allure, is really nothing more
than the logical (and far less hypocritical) extrapolation of all
those self-help gurus who constantly show up on Oprah to preach their
me-first gospel of self-actualization.  In this context, the joke
works, but like the latest Columbine joke, some people will get it and
enjoy a good laugh, and others won't.  Hopefully, though, their silly
moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us.

  "First rule of Fight Club is, don't talk about fight club." This quote deals
directly with my opinion of this film, because quite frankly, it's not even
worth mentioning.
  Director David Fincher (Seven) has completely gone over the edge. With crude
humor, an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture, I'm
surprised I didn't walk out. This just goes to show that hype kills. It's very
rare that a film so hyped up as "Fight Club" turns out to be noteworthy, and
this is no exception.
  The story goes like this. Edward Norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten
his dull life by going to a variety of  disease therapy sessions, until he
meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). Norton claims that she is wrecking his
pleasurable lifestyle, when he spots her at a session that he also attended.
Apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like, literally
living in pain. Why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me, but
things do get worse. Norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling,
and it's on a plane that he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The two men develop
a bond, and go out to a bar, and by golly after they get drunk, the two pitiful
characters fight. How do they come up with this stuff? Anyway, their fighting
catches other pathetic loser's attention, and a club is formed.
  Out of all this mess, there manages to lie a message. Fincher shows us that
society is like robots. We work in our jobs doing things step by step, and want
out. Our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really
are, and we blame it on others. Call me crazy, but this is common knowledge. I
think Fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it
really is, which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably.
  Even with two good actors, and a solid actress, they only manage to weaken
the story. I couldn't help but hide my face in shame when Norton beats himself
up into a bloody pulp. It just shows how desperate the script is for attention.
I guess Brad Pitt was right for this role, because I felt like beating him up
myself. His bothersome and depressing character, made me disgusted at his 20
million fee. It only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing
more. Helena Bonham Carter however really had no purpose. She just popped up on
screen, mumbled some lines, smoked and left. This continues for what seems like
6 hours.
  The film drags on and my headache gets bigger, while "Fight Club" nears what
I think might be the end. Unfortunately by then, the film hits rock bottom.
Though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes, it backs down
again and continues to move at a snails pace. 
  On a side note, the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film,
that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer.
Fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson.
Concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment, won't do any good
if everything else is in need of support. Also, I'm afraid that immature men
might respond to the film's violence. The last thing the world needs is people
praising a leader of a pointless cult. 
  When the film ends, I'm just glad to get home and take some advil. You'll
either enjoy what the film has to offer, or agree with Ed Norton when he says
"This is so F***ing stupid."

If there's one thing that `Fight Club' unabashedly
displays, it's that the era of the sensitive male is
over.  Men do not gush with gooey sentimentality. 
Restraint is only a temporary state of mind.  There is
an animal inside all of us, and it's aching to break
out.  But the rules of society and the pleas of our
local community beg all of us to be kinder and
gentler.  Thus, we simply brush aside any feelings of
aggression and replace them with happy thoughts and
trance music.  But just once, I'd like catch up to the
guy who cut me off and run him off the road.
With that in mind, `Fight Club' is a movie to which
many of us can relate.  Narrated by the angst-filled
Edward Norton, he represents something that is
probably inside many of us.  Dressed in buttoned white
shirts and solid dark ties, he's stuck in a job that
gradually squeezes every ounce of passion from his
life.  He is the beleaguered worker whose personal
nirvana comes from furnishing his condo with as many
items from the IKEA catalogue as possible.  There is
very little excitement in his life as he constantly
drifts between a state of consciousness and
unconsciousness.  This man has every reason to be
angry.  But he doesn't have the spirit to do so.  He
has been asleep far too long.  
His life is a stark contrast to soap maker, salesman,
and chance acquaintance, Tyler Durden (the chiseled
Brad Pitt).  Everything about Tyler is a little bit
larger than life.  He's extremely confident, donning
red-tinted glasses and looking somewhat like a pimp. 
He's extremely intelligent, reciting to him how
certain household chemicals can be easily mixed
together to form highly power explosives.  And he's
fearless, taking him on a raid of a liposuction clinic
where he steals human fat needed for the high quality
of his soap.  Tyler is God.  He talks, walks, and
attracts girls in the way that Norton's narrator never
could.
The only commonality between them is that they both
possess pent aggression that they need to release. 
Finally, Tyler says, `Hit me as hard as you can. 
You'll never learn anything about yourself unless
you've been in a fight.'   So, the first swing is
taken and surprisingly, there is actually something
therapeutic about clenching one's fist and thrusting
it forward into someone else's face.  Fight Club is
born.  Soon, other men are joining this secret
society.  They are the local garbagemen, drivers,
delivery boys, waiters and middle managers who are
sick and tired of their lives.  Fight Club can bring
about the catharsis that they so desperately seek,
which outweighs any pain that they feel from the
myriad of broken noses and bruised faces.
Up through the first act, I enjoyed the essence and
smartness of `Fight Club.'  It's a good-looking film
with a terrific effort by Norton and Pitt.  And I also
liked Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), as the frustrated
loner who can't understand why pounding each other
with fists is better than having sex with her.  Then I
realized that the men who participate in Fight Club do
not find the spiritual freedom that they so badly
want.  Oddly, Fight Club evolves into some kind of
cult where members engage in acts of vandalism
throughout the city.   The argument can be made that
the direction in which the film takes asks the
question of how far is too far.'  With Norton at one
end of the spectrum and Pitt at the other, can a
comfortable middle ground be found or does one side
have to give it all up?  It's an interesting question
to be sure, and I wish that there were a smarter way
in which the film tries to answer the question.  As it
stands, `Fight Club' is philosophy on one end of the
spectrum and glossy thriller at the other end with no
comfortable middle ground.

         "The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight
Club," says ringmaster Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), addressing a group of
eager young men who've assembled in the basement of a seedy bar to beat
each other senseless. "The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk
about Fight Club."
 Ah, but rules were made to be broken, and it's a safe bet
everyone who sees director David Fincher's brutal, stylistically
brilliant "Fight Club" will have something to say about it. Given the
current climate of political correctness, most of those comments will be
negative, denouncing the movie for glamorizing violence and terrorism or
shaming the script's anti-everything stance.
 Those with long memories will recall there was once another
picture which earned the same kinds of criticisms when it was first
released: Stanley Kubrick's 1971 masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange." If
"Orange" was a bitter answer to the "all you need is love" message of
the late 1960s, "Club" is a brass-knuckled slap in the face to yuppiedom
and its "greed is good" mantra.
 Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel was compared in some critical
quarters to J.G. Ballard's "Crash" in its depiction of outsiders brought
together by shared passions for pain. But Ballard's characters were
cryptic and mostly voyeuristic, while "Fight Club" is made up of
everyday people, the same kinds of educated, mildly successful guys
you'd find in any office building or apartment complex.
 One of them is our nameless narrator (Edward Norton), a recall
coordinator for a major car company. He's a drab, joyless, constantly
exhausted drone who finds his only fulfillment in life comes from
crashing support group meetings, such as those for victims of testicular
cancer or "incest survivors."
 When he crosses pathes first with chain-smoking "tourist" Marla
Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and then with the mysterious soap salesman
Tyler Durden, our hero begins to rethink his entire life and to wonder
why he's let himself be defined by the IKEA and Crate and Barrel
furnishings decorating his condo. "The things you own end up owning
you," Tyler tells him.
 Fight Club, the new outlet for the narrator's built-up
hostility, is an exclusive society in which the members pummel each
other with their bare fists; black eyes, shattered jaws and broken teeth
are this club's equivalent of the secret handshake. But what begins as a
bloody good time eventually mutates into something bigger and more
dangerous as Fight Club organizer Tyler becomes increasingly messianic
and starts giving out "homework assignments" to his devotees.
 "We have no Great War, no Great Depression," insists Tyler.
"Our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives."
The sermonette resounds with the Fight Club followers, and it's likely
to ring a familiar bell with many of the twenty- and thirtysomethings in
the audience. The movie is quite astute in recognizing and capitalizing
on the resentment felt by a large portion of our blue-collar and
white-collar workforce, the people who live paycheck to paycheck and
badly want to believe that a new car or a larger wardrobe will magically
change their circumstances.
 Even if you can't accept its message, "Fight Club" may still
draw you in through Fincher's spellbinding scene compositions and clever
use of digital animation and extreme close-ups. Like all his work, the
film is dark and moody -- the actors are almost always seen in
half-light or shadows or varying shades of black -- but at the same time
there's a feverish urgency in the storytelling. Although the movie is
almost two and a half hours long, it seems to whiz past your eyes like a
graffiti-covered subway train.
 After seriously damaging his credibility with wooden
performances in "The Devil's Own," "Seven Years in Tibet" and the
sleep-inducing "Meet Joe Black," Pitt rebounds spectacularly here,
turning Tyler into a hustler who's equal parts smarm and charm. Carter,
speaking in a brittle accent reminiscent of Judy Davis, is engagingly
batty; listen for the song she sings on her way out of Tyler's
dilapidated house.
 Norton, however, is flat-out amazing in the kind of part most
actors would dismiss as being unplayable. He's required to be the
movie's moral center, as well as milk humor out of bizarre situations
(such as a soon-to-be classic moment in his boss' office) and undergo a
near-complete personality transformation in the course of the action.
Norton does it all, and much more, subtly conveying his attraction to
Tyler and his disillusionment with what he sees as the perversion of his
dream.
 That's important because anyone who pays attention will see the
movie is not an endorsement of anarchy, but a warning about what can
happen in a world full of confused, angry men without any positive role
models to follow. Yet Fincher's film will probably be condemned by many
of the same moviegoers who turned mindless schlock like "Double
Jeopardy" (in which we're asked to root for Ashley Judd's character to
track down and kill her husband) and "The General's Daughter" (which
turns a rape victim into a dominatrix before giving us a lengthy
depiction of her murder) into major box office hits. If it does nothing
else, "Fight Club" should serve to point out the hypocracy of the
general public, which begs for gun control and stricter enforcement of
movie ratings one moment and drops its kids off at the video store to
pick up "The Matrix" the next. James Sanford

In Don DeLillo's novel Underworld, one character argues that "Rage and
violence can be elements of productive tension in a soul. They can serve
the fullness of one's identity. One way a man untrivialises himself is
to punch another man in the mouth." This is the subversive idea at the
heart of Fight Club.
Edward Norton plays The Narrator. He has a respectable job and an
apartment full of nice furniture and clothes, but he is troubled - his
job is unsatisfying and he cannot sleep. He seeks comfort in attending
self-help groups for people with diseases he doesn't have, finding
particular solace in a support group for victims of testicular cancer.
Just as The Narrator's life seems a little more settled, he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), an anarchic crazy-man with several night-time jobs
who spreads a little chaos with everything he does. As a waiter he
urinates in the soup. As a cinema projectionist he splices subliminal
frames from pornographic movies into family films. As a soap salesman
he... but that would be giving away too much.
Outside a bar, Tyler invites The Narrator to hit him. He is reluctant at
first, but they soon start brawling. They find a strange satisfaction in
their cuts and bruises and meet every week to fight. Other men gather to
watch, and eventually one of then asks to join in. The first Fight Club
is born. Men from all walks of life gather in a dingy basement and take
turns at fist-fighting, beating each other to a pulp, and in the process
fighting back against their emasculation at the hands of society and
finding out what it means to be a brutish primaeval man again in an
over-civilised world. The club is an instant success and fight clubs
start appearing all over the country. Tyler Durden becomes an
underground hero, but is unsatisfied and seeks to inspire further chaos
through the sinister Project Mayhem.
David Fincher directs with a manic hyperactive inventiveness.
Astonishing images illustrate throwaway ideas, such as The Narrator's
apartment seen as items in an Ikea catalogue, or for a few seconds, a
terrifyingly realised mid-air plane collision. The medium of film itself
is played with: barely noticeable images appear only for a frame or two,
fake cue dots are used, and the film appears to judder and slip in the
projector showing its sprocket holes on the screen. And yet none of this
comes across as being tricksy: it all makes perfect sense in the context
of this surreal wham-bam beat-em-up world. Jim Uhls' screenplay (from
Chuck Palahniuk's novel) crackles along providing deliciously dangerous
fun. The film contains many jokes, but laughing is rarely an option -
the context of the jokes is so dark and the film so quickfire that by
the time you've had time to register that something was actually pretty
funny, the story has moved on.
Some have expressed outrage at the violence in the film. The fight
scenes are indeed very hard to watch, the savageness heightened by the
sounds of fist splitting flesh and breaking bone and tooth. One beating
in particular is so brutal and bloody that I was glad it had been
slightly cut. But like A Clockwork Orange nearly thirty years ago, Fight
Club is not so much a violent film as a film about violence, so its
disturbing depiction of savagery is more justifiable than the
meaningless violence in the average Hollywood action movie. Stanley
Kubrick's film raised the question of whether it is right for society to
suppress a man's natural brutality. Fight Club takes as a premise that
it's too late - social changes have already done it to men on a huge
scale - and tells the story of some men's reaction to this denial of
their true nature.
Both Norton and Pitt are magnificent, with Norton perhaps just coming
out on top given the more complex character he has to play. Excellent
design, sound and make-up all contribute to the film's impact and a fine
soundtrack from The Dust Brothers provides a perfect hard-but-cool
backdrop. There is a staggering and quite bizarre twist in the plot
which some people will find harder to stomach than the film's violence,
but I thought it gave the film a mythical, fantastical edge and provided
a retrospective justification for the film's wild visual style.
Dangerous and dazzling, Fight Club is as near as makes no difference a
masterpiece and beats Election into second place as my film of the year.

"Fight Club" is, by and large, an effective film that surrealistically
describes the status of the American male at the end of the 20th
century: disenchanted, unfulfilled, castrated and looking for a way
out. At times equally exhilarating, insightful, funny and inscrutable,
"Fight Club" has enough ideas for five films and story lines for
three, pushing well beyond two hours in length and exhausting the
audience's attention span in the process. In a season where many films
have modest and predictable goals, "Fight Club" is a wild smorgasbord.
The beginning of the film is pitch perfect, chronicling the
desperation and despair of modern living in a society where comfort is
the measure of success.  It's the ultimate visual statement of the
question: Are you working for your car or is your car working for you?
A consumer society that emasculates men.  No rite of passage into
manhood, no lion or bear to kill. In an era where men do not have
missions, in the urban wilderness, what is there to hunt? To dominate?
To kill?
To its credit, "Fight Club" has pace, it builds up to its violent
scenes and at times offers an amusing and pathetic portrait of a
nebbish loner, Edward Norton ("Primal Fear", "American History X"),
unnamed at the beginning of the film, aside from the pseudonyms he
uses as he trolls for emotional connection by attending every support
group he can find. But for the most part he is sleepwalking through
life, sad with dark circled eyes, thinking that his life will be
complete once he buys all his IKEA furniture. He becomes a support
group junkie because it's the only way he can relate and have contact
with people, and discovers that his "power animal", in one hilarious
visualization scene, is a penguin. By chance he meets Tyler Durden,
played by Brad Pitt ("Legends of the Fall", "Seven"), who appears to
have it all in the manhood department: he is, literally as we find
out, everything that Edward Norton's character is not. He admires the
freedom of Durden, a man's man, independent and self assured, who's
not ashamed of his desires and wants.
Durden doesn't own anything, and makes his living by raiding
liposuction disposal units, his primary ingredient to make soap that
he sells to upscale department stores, in other words, he is the urban
equivalent of a hunter gatherer, using the system so that he can live
by his own rules. Durden makes you think that he's just a couple of
negative life experiences away from the serial killer Pitt played in
"Kalifornia."
Together, they establish a fight club for men, as an underground way
to express rage and live on the edge, to feel alive by approaching
death. Durden beds Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman Norton
accosted in his exploratory support group encounters. And this is
where we get the first hint that Durden is pure, undiluted id unbound,
and sets up what we eventually discover: that both Pitt and Norton are
Tyler Durden, the intellect and the id fractionated, dissociated from
each other. The fact that they live in a decaying house but in
different rooms is symbolic of that separation. This film, bottom
line, turns out to be a primer in Sigmund Freud and Robert Bly with a
touch of Jung added in.
While this is a cunning twist, (on par with the surprise twist in "The
Sixth Sense"), unfortunately it makes the last quarter of the film
difficult going, as it loses its momentum, particularly as the story
departs on a fascist plot line designed to wreak larger havoc on
society in order to bring about collapse.
Fincher has a strong visual and mood setting style that cumulatively
builds suspense. He is no stranger to the dark nature of mankind as
evidenced in the film "Seven". Fincher works in the nether regions of
the color spectrum preferring blacks, grays and other muted
colors. "Fight Club" also plays with perspective effectively, using
sound and visual effects, as well as simple devices such as having
characters break the fourth wall by talking directly to the
audience. This is like an underground film that accidentally got
greenlighted with a $60 million budget.
One may be tempted to have a knee jerk reaction that the violence and
fascist tone in "Fight Club" lands it in the odious company of
"Natural Born Killers", but this film is much smarter and deeper than
that. The violence in "Fight Club" is honest and ugly. It's not a
ballet like Sam Peckinpaw ("The Wild Bunch") or a comedic choreography
like Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". "Fight Club" is about a
man trying to become an integrated and whole human being, searching
for identity, a place, a mission in a consumer world where our last
major war was over petroleum.
"Fight Club" is anchored in the performance of its two stars and
intelligently written with sharp observations about American
society. Norton carries the first part of the film masterfully. As for
Brad Pitt, it deconstructs his matinee idol status and makes him a
truly menacing figure. This is arguably the most audacious mainstream
movie to be released this year. And even though it's outrageous and
out of control, and runs out of gas before the end, it's because this
film is trying to push the envelope and every button in sight at the
same time.

'Fight Club' tells the story of urban paranoia in perhaps the best way I've
seen since Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' in 1976.  The film tries every
possible way to shock the audience with dread, visual excrement, free
flowing ideas and morbid theories and a protagonist whose very existence is
so far beyond pathetic, that it seems not of this world.  The movie is a
product of director David Fincher, a man whose films are so ugly, they often
miss the real point they're trying to make.  Fincher has been a music video
director and cuts his motion pictures rapidly with visual tricks and plays
with his film a bit too much in the cutting room.  'Alien 3' was Fincher's
first real notice and it received mostly negative reviews.  His hugely
commercial 'Seven' in 1995 had its high points and low points and came
across as a cult like version of 'The Silence of the Lambs' with Kevin
Spacey being the only stand out member of the cast.  'The Game' with Michael
Douglas and Sean Penn in 1997 was like touring a broken down fun house and
now Fincher has released his most controversial film to date with 'Fight
Club'.
You simply can't say enough good things about Edward Norton.  His enormous
talent as an actor is matched only by the fact that he chooses his films
carefully and makes the most of his characterizations.  His next move should
be to act alongside a Newman, a Duvall or a Hoffman the way Tom Cruise has
because since Tom Cruise has held his own with those actors, imagine what
Norton could do!  In 'Fight Club' he is Jack, our narrator and friend who
works for a major car manufacturer and hates his job, his boss and his
surroundings.  On a business flight one night he meets Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt), a soap manufacturer and salesman who befriends Norton and we later
see a strange twist in their relationship that plays with Norton's mind
better than most psychological thrillers of its type.
After Jack's condo is terrorized by a bombing, Tyler puts him up at his
place and the two of them form a strange group of other angry, young to
middle aged men who have similar lives and call it "fight club".  It's an
organization of counter culture where unorthodox, bare fisted fights occur
and anything goes in the manly art of self defense.  Others gather around as
two selected members of the group fight and they have very strict rules
about the sacred order of the club.  Jack also has many problems.  His lack
of friends forces him sub consciously to attend support groups where people
suffer from many diseases and disorders.  One is for a group of men with
testicular cancer and Jack becomes involved with Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf),
a man who later becomes a member of the club.  Jack also meets Marla Singer,
a woman with no life who lives in poverty, smokes herself in a way that may
lead to an early grave and she has no direction in her life.
"Fight club" eventually makes its way into many major cities around the
United States and borders on becoming a terrorist organization striking at
the very heart of commerce and financial viability.  Fincher makes the most
of his wide screen presentation and uses the ratio very well in structuring
his film technically that bends and stretches the limits of the human mind
and shows just how much of an emery it can become in each of us.  'Fight
Club' may seem a bit lengthy but it does sit well as it never seems
repetitive and always has a few goodies up its sleeve.
The controversy surrounding 'Fight Club' will become gigantic.  It's not a
film for the casual movie goer.  Its hard core presentation is unsparing.
It goes for the jugular the way 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Do the Right Thing'
and 'JFK' did.  It's also a film that will sit well with cult film
historians who have appreciated such films as 'Eraserhead', 'The Rocky
Horror Picture Show' and 'Blue Velvet'.
The film's screenplay is by Jim Uhls, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk.
There are many layers of human nature mixed with a perspective view of life
at the bottom of the world and reflects just how many people are
increasingly desperate in their lives, striving for something better and
realizing that opportunities for success are in many cases, closed doors in
their lives and an alternative for their ambitions must be found.  Although
Brad Pitt receives first billing, his character resembles much of the
psychotic tumbling found in his performance in '12 Monkeys' but Pitt does a
good job with what he's given here.  Again, this film belongs to Edward
Norton.  I hope he receives his third Oscar nomination with this film as he
is destined to certainly win one some day if there is any justice.

Note: Just a little of the plot is explained!
Rated: R for graphic violence and gore, strong language, sexuality and some
nudity.
Starring: Edward Nortan, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, Jared
Leto.
"The first rule of Fight Club is, you'd don't talk about Fight Club, the second
rule of Fight Club is you DON'T TALK about Fight Club"
Well Ok I won't talk about Fight Club. I will say that it is one of the most
incredibly original movie ever made, that is at the same time energetic, funny,
violent, intense and sad. Brad Pitt give his best performance to date as does
Edward Nortan and Helena Bonham Carter. Being a David Fincher movie (Seven) I
was expecting a messed up, demented yet artistic piece of art that to my
surprise instantly to me became a masterpiece that had an exploding soundtrack
to back it up as well as a story that was amazingly original.
Ok let me try to tell the plot without giving too much of it away: Edward
Nortan our narrator whom we never find out the name let's just call him Jack is
a normal guy lives a normal life, except one day when he cannot sleep. He then
starts visiting group therapies, going under false names just to try and get
out his depression and emotions. He goes to groups for stuff he doesn't even
have: Testicular Cancer being a standout. That's where he meets her: Marla
(played by the always great Helena Bonham Carter)a bad girl with a sweet side.
She too going to groups for what she doesn't have.
Then the fun begins, on his way to a business thing 'Jack' meets a person who
will change his life forever. He meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). They instantly
hit it off and 'Jack' moves in with Tyler. The two decide to start a club, a
fight club for people who like to get together and well fight. The club gets
underway but things start to get a little out of hand. From here on I ain't
saying nothing else. The whole movie is a cinematic classic. Nothing less we
can always too call it a masterpiece cause that's's what it was too. David
Fincher gives the movie just that right touch to make us believe we are living
in the film rather than watching it. What we don't know is the best thing. The
audience has to think of what they want and believe what they want, because you
really can't go wrong.
Brad Pitt is one of the most skilled actors in Hollywood and makes Tyler Durden
my favorite character in a movie. He's one of those people everyone wants to be
like. Brad Pitt just brings out the character even more and has us believing
that he is Tyler Durden. Oscar Worthy work here. Edward Nortan who gave a
terrific performance in 'American History X' gives a great performance here as
our main character. The way he relates to his character and plays him out makes
us think that he should be picked as best actor. Helena Bonham Carter gives the
performance of her career as Marla the whacked out woman Jack falls for.
The writing in the movie was constantly smart and clever. It has a bit of
everything: Profanity and satire. Both mixing into one quite perfectly might I
add. All the dialogue that comes from the characters are realistic and never
pretentious. Another thing I found excellent about the movie was the way it was
made. It came away from the MTV style editing and went into the hardcore rock
video type thing. It has a dark, gritty atmosphere that makes us part of the
story and made me at least believe it was almost real. This stuff can happen
and does happen. By the end we are left with out jaws hanging down close to the
ground getting dirty. The last 30 minutes have many twists that make us wonder
why movies like this just can't be made anymore?
The bottom line is Fight Club is a new masterpiece for a new generation. Every
so often a move comes along that changed movie-goers lived forever. Fight Club
is that movie. A very controversial movie but deals with the issues of fascism,
violence and secret clubs. Should these things go on? Should we really have
clubs where you beat each other to bloody pulps? That isn't for me to decide.
But as far as I'm concerned good luck.
If you think this movie is nothing but violence and a group of men beating each
other to an inch of their lives. Forget it this is a movie with in-depth
character studies as well as a story that gets so involved by the time the end
credits role I was ready to watch it again just to be amazed. The movie has a
side to it that most don't, it seems like a movie with mean-spirit and ends up
being a movie with a messed up personality to it that we can somehow all relate
to. But remember when you see Fight Club, there are two rules, First Rule: You
don't talk about Fight Club, Second rule: You DON'T TALK about Fight Club. See
it, live it, experience it, be amazed.

It is an unconventional mainstream film, whose aim is to target a
perpetually youth-oriented audience (anyone from aged 17 to 50) who want
to identify with a film that is rebellious against society and their
institutions. It succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for
those who like to see Brad Pitt' pecs and how Edward Norton squirms when
beaten up, and be bemused to hear Helena Bonham Carter complain that the
boys sure love their violence more than they do sex.
The film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the
"old" noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society
as a whole. The sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by
relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point, too much glitter,
and Pitt' and Norton' overacting; what results is a jarring experience,
enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is
the way to achieve respect (it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a
parody reflecting the violence in America: the violence is the thing in
this story that the audience will remember most about this film). It
succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film, which makes the
provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and
go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden
meanings in their life, which are given to them by false prophets,
something that is happening currently in America to a great extent. But
this film is too stilted, unconvincing, and inane to be the messenger
delivering a warning about such dangers in society.
But if its comedy that it is after, then it has some success in meeting
those expectations, as the stars were able to project themselves into
this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift.
The film features a listless narrator named Jack (Edward Norton) to tell
its story. He calls himself many names but no one in the film calls him
by his right name, which is supposed to indicate that he is a symbol for
the anonymous worker in contemporary America. He is a rather
inconspicuous type, a further symbol of the modern man caught in the
rat-race of the high tech world, who will tell us his loser's story of
how as an unmarried 30-year-old, he feels unsatisfied with himself and
with the way his life is going. We first see him in the opening scene
being forced to flash back on his life, as the film's other protagonist
in this nightmarish farce, the specter-like Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt),
has him tied to a chair and with a gun pointed inside his mouth, and is
asking him to tell him what he is thinking about before he dies.
His story unfolds via flashbacks from his tied up position, as he tries
to piece together what happened to him after he met Tyler and the film
goes on for a dreary 139 minutes of non cinematic narration intermixed
with an orgy of visual innovativeness.
He meets the nefarious Tyler on an airplane and comes to live with him
in the toxic part of town where he resides, as he is invited into the
squatter's dilapidated vacant house when returning from his airplane
flight and discovering that his condo was blown up.
The more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling
not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy, the more we learn how
depraved he is. We are told that he makes his product from discarded
liposuctioned human fat which he steals from the waste removal garbage
cans and then sells them to boutiques who sell the product for $20 a
bar; he also works part-time as a movie projectionists, splicing in
penises into the children's film Cinderella that is currently showing;
and, he also works part-time as a waiter in a ritzy hotel, where he
urinates in the soup (now isn't that a pisser!).
While the Narrator is shown to be an uptight yuppie, living for material
comfort, in particular, collecting expensive Scandinavian furniture to
assuage his empty soul and define himself as a person. He works at a
well-compensated but corrupt job for a big car manufacturer, as the
representative for the company who goes out to investigate car crashes
where the manufacturer he represents is being sued and it is his job to
decide if it is cheaper to recall the malfunctioning parts that caused
the accident or to fight the suit filed against the manufacturer. Human
lives are not part of this equation.
Evidently, as we get to know these two opposites, we determine that they
are perfectly suited for each other. A homo-erotic edge to their
relationship is also hinted at, but like everything in this film, it is
only superficially covered.
The Narrator suffers from insomnia, probably caused by his
non-meaningful life. Upon an inadvertent remark made by his physician,
who refuses to prescribe sleeping pills or pain killers for him, but
tells him if you want to see real pain see how the men in the support
group who have testicular cancer feel. The Narrator takes the doctor up
on that idle suggestion and finds comfort there by crying on the
shoulders of one of the men he is paired with, Big Bob Paulsen
(Meatloaf). Finding it therapeutic to listen to someone else talk about
their real pain and seeing that it will actually allow him to sleep like
a baby, he therefore becomes a support group junkie, joining a wide
variety of these self-help groups under false pretenses. It is here that
he meets another phony, who also goes to these groups even though she
doesn't have the disease the group calls for, the street-wise,
emotionally bankrupt Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), who is
addicted to attending meetings. She is a tourist, like him, going
through life without finding herself. But she spoils his game as a
faker, as he wants to be the only fake there and to be the one who is
nurtured by the real pain of others.
The heart of the story takes place when the budding friendship between
the two diverse misfits develops. The utterly depraved Tyler, exhibiting
the ability to be a leader, with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims
against the emptiness of materialism, such as, "You are not your job,"
and the irresolute Narrator, who is someone crying out for help and who
is also someone ripe for being brainwashed.
Their relationship blossoms on their first night out when drinking
together, and violence becomes the prerequisite for continuing it, as
they take turns beating each other up, and with this added expression of
meaning to their life bringing great satisfaction to them, they decide
to open up what they call a Fight Club in the cellar of a bar, allowing
other disgruntled types to voice their need for violence in their lives
and to give them a sense of what real pain is. There's a series of
rules, including the cleverly stated rule number 1 and 2, no one talks
about the club. That all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of
taste, though I think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way, where bad
taste rules the day. The humor is catered to those who like their laughs
coming to them shock treatment style. Their alienation from society,
supposedly, relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless
about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have
been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and
join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems, which should
give the film a conventional reason for being made.
The problem with the film's message, is that it comes via a film that is
relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story,
and then, to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason, is almost
enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent
shootings in America's schools and the other sensational newsworthy
violent acts, wonder what to make of this film, or to just barf at this
outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in
such a mindlessly simple way. The fatuous simplicity the film offers for
linking America's penchant for violence and sex, with the peoples' lack
of fulfillment from meaningful jobs, is too much of a generality to be
taken seriously. This response to what has gone wrong with the American
dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response, as those who would
blame films such as this one for America's problems.
At some point in the film, probably as soon as the Fight Club was
started by Tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then
expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret
society of Mayhem, the film stopped being smart and turned into a
pointless nonsensical venture, that is not serious enough to take
seriously, except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual
style and kinetic energy it shows.
The film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by Tyler, that
"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,"
is an alluring one. If that were developed further along in the
storyline, then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film
that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a
cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say, such as the
drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the
shackles of a consumer society. I didn't fall under Brad Pitt' spell as
easily as Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter did, and therefore was
not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved. By the
end of the film, it becomes apparent that Tyler is a dangerous
psychopath and that all the charm he exhibited earlier on could not hide
his evil nature.
For me, this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the
heavyweight class. What it offers for philosophy, is similar to the kind
of superficial sound bites the TV news might offer to comment on its
headline stories, as the news people seem to always play it safe and
never take a radical position on the events they cover. What the film
offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy, for a story that is more
steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications
in a consumer society. In order words, the major problem with the film,
is that the filmmaker's position on where he stands is never broached.
It is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies, and the
emptiness of their materialistic lives. But, what is the filmmaker's
position about the sudden violence in society, other than being against
the vacuous groups he lumps together? Exploring that avenue, and not
getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film, might have
been a more radical route to have gone down. It was very hard for me to
see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film
that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it, but was disappointing in
its scope... and... was certainly not a radical film.

"This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."
1999 is going to be noted as just possibly the most self reflective
year of motion pictures. So far we had 'American Beauty', 'Three
Kings', 'The Matrix', 'Anywhere But Here', all films dealing in one
way or another with the issue of self worth and identity. Director
David Fincher now adds his two cents to the debate and comes up with
an equally interesting parable of human angst and social breakdown.
Edward Norton stars as 'The Narrator', we never know (or recognize his
real name), but suffice to say that he is a troubled man. Suffering
from chronic insomnia, The Narrator is stuck in a job he hates, a
daily life of loneliness and despair. He joins support groups, under
the guise of illness or impending death in an attempt to feel
something, anything. He quickly becomes addicted to this method of
emotional dependence, moving almost nightly from one group to another.
His world is invaded though by another emotional tourist, Marla Singer
(Helena Bonham Carter), a suicidal waif living on the edge of society.
The Narrator is both intrigued and repelled by this woman, who cheats
and steals, scratching out an existence while the Narrator struggles
with his daily grind and catalogue furnished home. Unable to deal with
someone else copying his subterfuge, He confronts Marla with her
charade. She returns the indictment.
Unable to deal with the loss of his support, The Narrator plunges into
his work. He travels, investigating auto defects for a major car
manufacturer. His job is to weigh the costs between possible lawsuits
and a mass recall for defective parts. On one of his flights he meets
up with Tyler Durder (Brad Pitt), a sociopathic cross between William
S. Burroughs and Deepak Chopra.
When the narrator returns home, he finds that his condo has been
destroyed in an explosion and fire. Everything he owns has been
destroyed. At first he attempts to call Marla, but unable to deal with
her honesty, he instead calls Tyler. The two men meet at a bar, when
The narrator finally, after prompting asks if he can stay with Tyler.
Tyler agrees on one condition. He asks the Narrator to hit him as hard
as he can!
The two men fight, creating a strange and primitive bound between
them.
Moving in with Tyler, the narrator finds that the living conditions
are much less than he could ever have expected. The home that Tyler
lives in is anything but livable. Water floods the basement, walls and
stairs are crumbling, and everything is in disrepair. From here Tyler
and the Narrator start to become brothers, getting other lost and
soulless men to join them in their search for self awareness through
pain and anarchy.
"Fight Club" is a daring film. It is both a hard edge action film and
diatribe against violence. Anarchy rules in this film, more so than
any other in recent years. The only analogous film could possibly be
George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' (another film that skirted the
issue of consumerism as a disease). What "Fight Club" does and does
brilliantly, is to shine a farcical light into the face of society's
obsession with feeling good about one's self. Director David Fincher
and Screenwriter Jim Uhls have crafted a thought provoking morality
tale of self abuse for the 12 step generation.
Jim Uhls' script base on the book by Chuck Palahniuk,, is a clever
piece of writing. Tyler's soliloquies and bullshit Zen are so absurd
as to be the real thing. In this universe, it makes sense to beat
yourself senseless physically, because "self improvement is
masturbation.. self destruction is the answer" The film is a complex
character study that leads the viewer through an almost subliminal
Rorschach test. So many scenes play out with double meaning that the
final denouncement is both expected and surprising.
David Fincher has crafted his most extreme film. Using graphic close
ups, computer manipulation, visual effects, Dutch angles and quick
cuts, Fincher has created a filmic representation of his lead
character. Everything here is seen through The Narrator's eyes, even
in the third person. This is almost as shocking a device as what
Robert Montgomery did with his directorial debut "Lady in the Lake"
(1947).
Admittedly, the film does shift gears half way through the film. Those
expecting a tale about men engaging in bare knuckle fights (ala the
Charles Bronson film "Hard Times" (1975)) are bound to be
disappointed. This is a film about much loftier ideas. As Fight Club
escalates into a terrorist organization, it becomes less focused on
the individual battles, and more focused on The Narrator's realization
of his own mania, while the group of fighters around him become more
autonomous. It is only when one of their members is killed during an
extreme act of vandalism, that the Narrator forces the group to
recognize the fallen man's name. This becomes a mantra, in death you
have a name. There is victory in Death. There is identity in Death.
The Narrator rebels, putting his own life in jeopardy. He has done
everything he could to eliminate his seemingly boring and self
absorbed life, and finally has to fight for that life, as his own Id
fights to stop him.
The performances of the film are all stellar. Edward Norton casts a
frighteningly real presents of a man who has reached his limits. Mr.
Norton manages to make his character both humorously vulnerable and
frighteningly mundane. His character goes through a radical
realization, that he is not the man he thought he was.
Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden swaggers and stomps through his part,
commanding every inch of the frame that he inhabits. Pitt has never
been so forceful or relaxed in his performance, possibly his best turn
outside of Terry Gilliams' "The 12 Monkeys". His character is both
attractive and frightening in almost a reversal of Norton's character.
Helena Bonham Carter makes her character of Marla Singer a streetwise
urchin of noble madness. Here is a woman who has accepted her plight
and her mania and deals with it. Seeing through most of the hypocrisy
around her. Her relationship with both Tyler and The Narrator is both
complex and puzzling, which leads to the fascinating but not unseen
denouncement.
The best performance is from singer/ actor Meat Loaf Aday as Robert
Paulson. A victim of testicular cancer, Robert has developed mammary
sized breasts as a result of his steroid abuse and the hormones used
in his treatment. His character has literally and figuratively fused
both the masculine and feminine aspects of male life into one
shockingly absurd personality. A fine and daring performance.
The photography by Jeff Cronenweth is wondrously bleak. Never has self
absorption been so accurately portrayed  cinematically. Emblazoned
with numerous visual and computer effects, the photography becomes an
extension of the characters, almost eclipsing them in fact. The film
is both dense and shallow in its pallet of color. The only hue that
really jumps off the screen is red. Not just the color of blood, but
rage, embarrassment, confusion, and depravation. "Fight Club" is truly
one of the most cinematic films of recent years.
To summarize, "Fight Club" is not a film for everyone. It was never
(obviously) intended to appeal to a wide spectrum. A film that speaks
about loss and self denial and apathy in ways that is both disturbing
and humorous. The message of the film could, I feel, be best summed up
by the lyrics of John Lennon.. "You don't know what you've got, 'till
you lose it!". A hard edged film, that laughs at our foibles and mocks
our choices. Politically incorrect and insensitive.  A hard film to
forget.

 Fight Club (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton
and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by David Fincher.
 "Fight Club" is not what you perceive it to be.
 It is a movie that assails your senses and lacerates your emotions with a
one-two combination of visual style and barbed humor.
 Basically, "Fight Club" is a savage satire, an attack on consumerism, a
cry against the shallowness of our overly commercialized society. It is a
look at the bleakness and emptiness that engulfs a generation which has
grown up without a great war to fight or a great Depression to steel its
mettle.
 Ostensibly, "Fight Club" is about men who need to beat the shit out of
each other in order to feel alive and make an emotional connection with
another human being.
 But the film, directed by David Fincher, is more complicated than that.
 Fincher, the director of "Seven," leads you down a murky winding path of
dark, dank cellars and alleys in which water drips incessantly and blood
and sweat flow and coalesce as if choreographed by a Balanchine.
 As conceived by Fincher and screenwriter Jim Uhls, based on a novel by
Chuck Palahniuk,  "Fight Club" is the ultimate self-help, 12-step program.
 And that is where the story begins. The Narrator (Edward Norton) works for
an automobile corporation as some sort of claims adjuster. He is among the
walking dead, feeling nothing, unable to connect with anyone. He tries to
compensate for this void by buying furniture and gizmos from catalogs.
 He is an insomniac searching for some emotional release. He finds it when
he begins attending meetings of various groups: testicular cancer survivors
and incest victims, for example.
 People listen to you when they think you're dying, the Narrator explains.
 Through these encounters he gathers strength, emotional release - and free
coffee.
 All this changes though, when our hero meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a
young man who lives by his own rules. Tyler sells soap, which he makes
himself.
 Circumstances throw Tyler and our Narrator together. After a night of
drinking, Tyler goads his friend into hitting him. The two begin fighting
and discover it an enjoyable experience. The pain and bruises are the
confirmation of their humanity within the sterile confines of their
commercial-driven society.
 Soon the concept spreads as more and more men gather around the two.
 Eventually, Tyler forms a nationwide, underground army of disgruntled men
who wear their bandages and bruises as badges of honor.
 "Fight Club" is not as grim as it sounds. Actually it is quite funny, but
it's a sick, razor-slashing  humor. You will either laugh or be sickened.
 At one juncture Tyler and the Narrator make a guerrilla raid on the
garbage bins at a hospital to gather the fatty remnants from liposuction
operations because, as Tyler explains, human fat makes the best soap.
 It is a sequence that is revoltingly hilarious.
 Another moment finds the Narrator blackmailing his boss for a large
severance package by beating himself up in his superior's office, all the
while making it seem as if he is being beaten by his supervisor. Norton's
antics are ballet-like as he flings himself around the room, slamming into
tables and upending bookcases.
 Pitt and Norton give splendid performances. Norton is especially fine. He
again displays the talent that makes him one of the best - if not the
finest - actor of his generation.
 His Narrator begins the film as a dead-eyed, hollowed-cheek, zombie, an
unfeeling, unflinching human being running on automatic.
 As the film progresses, his character becomes more and more animated. His
body language slowly changes. He becomes looser, freer, more at ease with
the world.
 Pitt's Tyler is a cheerful, psychotic dynamo, an urban terrorist. He is a
sick and gross individual who takes pleasure in his rebellion. Working
part-time as a banquet caterer, for example, he urinates into the clam
chowder soup before serving it.
 Pitt creates a larger-than-life outsider. It is a daring performance that
is as comic as it is disturbing.
 Helena Bonham Carter's character is less defined. Her only function seems
to be as the third side of a triangle, to create conflict between Tyler and
the Narrator. Her motivations seem hazy, her usefulness merely a plot
device.
 "Fight Club" is a movie you may need to see more than once to appreciate
its complexity and subtlety. Its apocalyptic-style finale will stir debate.
 "Fight Club" is original, mesmerizing and mind-gripping. You will walk out
partially numbed and exhausted, knowing you have been through an experience
that has jabbed your psyche.

     Ah, how I love controversy!  Not since the release of Stanley
Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" this summer have critics disagreed so much
over one film.  At the theater in which I viewed the movie, several
people walked out after the scene in which one of the characters burns
his hand with a chemical, more left after one of the more grisly fight
scenes, and by the end of the film, it was me and about five other
people.  Being the snoop I am I overheard the conversation of one of
the couples walking out at the very end.  "Hon," the one woman said,
"next time, I pick the movie."  "Sorry about that," the man replied.
     But I wasn't sorry I saw it.  In fact, I was quite glad.  "Fight
Club" is one of the most flashy, original, hard-to-watch, mind-melting
films I've seen in a while.  Fincher, whose previous works include
"Seven" and "Alien3" (which I thought was tolerable, others disagreed)
has made a cult classic that challenges you intellectually, while
visually astounding you.  Unlike a lot of the other action films
Hollywood regurgitates and spits out at you, "Fight Club" actually has
a pulse ... inside, it's alive.
     The story revolves around Jack, played by Edward Norton, as he
trudges through his miserable life.  Like Patrick Bateman in Bret
Easton Ellis' "American Psycho," he is obsessed with purchasing
expensive furniture and exercise equipment for his apartment.  He
suffers from insomnia, and goes to his physician for some sleeping
pills.  The physician refuses, and tells him that he's not really
suffering - the men who have testicular cancer (and go to group
meetings to deal with the after effects of the disease) are the ones
who are suffering.  So, to make himself feel better, he goes to a
group meeting, pretends to have cancer, meets a large man with breasts
(due to hormone therapy) played by Meat Loaf, and, for the first time
in a long time, cries.  This crying is a panacea for him, and after
the meeting he goes home and sleeps comfortably.  Before you know it,
he is addicted to self-help meetings.
     It is here that he meets a kindred spirit, played by Helena
Bonham Carter (very convincing in her trash-whore role), who is also
addicted to self-help meetings. Her presence at these meetings
disrupts him, because she, like he, is actually quite healthy and
"faking" her illnesses (since she seems to be suicidal throughout the
film, it can be assumed that these groups give her a reason to live
even though she claims she only goes to them for the "free coffee").
Jack claims that the presence of another "faker" at these meetings
bothers him, and his sleeping problems are resurfacing.
     Another presence makes himself known to Jack, only this time it's
in the form of the grungy, testosterone-filled Tyler Derden (Brad
Pitt), who makes and sells soap.  A series of events occurs in Jack's
life and he and Tyler start living together, become friends, and
create Fight Club, where men (and only men) meet and exorcise their
homosexual demons by beating each other senseless.
     To reveal more of the plot would be wrong of me, because the film
gets wonderfully weird and while the twists taken may be considered
(by some) as being far-fetched, I view them as being symbolic of the
male psyche.  What's more "spirit crushing" (to use "Trainspotting"
terminology) than being forced to sit in a cubicle all day, typing
meaningless numbers into meaningless machines?  Why are we forced to
put up with dull, emotionless bosses who revel in wearing (gasp!)
cornflower blue ties on Wednesdays "for kicks?"  There are ways we can
escape, however.  Some of them are healthy, some of them not so.
     That's the film's warning.  Tyler Derden's quasi-Hitler approach
to the world is fascist, yes, but then again, Tyler Derden isn't
exactly the film's hero, now is he?  The message of the film is to
avoid going that far, because the potential to go that far is inside
all of us (the symbolism brings Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" to
mind).  If anything, the movie is anti-God (to agree with Alexander
Walker) in the way that the characters abuse and intentionally
disfigure their bodies.  This self-mutilation reminds me of "Sick: The
Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist" and Flanagan's getting
"back at" God for torturing him with cystic fibrosis.  But Jack and
Tyler don't have any major diseases - they aren't suffering from
physical death, but from an existential death.
     Fincher has said that this is supposed to be a comedy, and there
are some funny parts that will appeal to those with a dark sense of
humor.  The ending can best be described as tongue-in-cheek, and I
chuckled at exactly how dark things had become.  I think how you view
the film will depend on your own ideology and how well you accept the
"twist" at the end (these "twists" are one of Fincher's trademarks).
     Ignore what you hear from David Denby, Lisa Schwartzbaum or Roger
Ebert (who is notorious for misjudging films of this nature) and watch
the film for yourself.  Is it trash?  Is it subversive?  Does it
praise violence or show how destructive and detrimental it is to
society?  No matter how you look at it, there's no denying that
Fincher is genuinely talented.  And, like Kubrick, he knows just how
to push everyone's buttons.

This picture "coulda been a contenda!" The flimmakers' fancy foot work in
matching up richly odd (yet achingly familiar) characters for a round of
painful redemption is nothing short of excellent. Unfortunately, the young
fighter (the film) starts slurring its punches, slipping and sliding in its
own sweat by the sixth round. Though still standing at the bell in the
ninth, "Fight Club" voluntarily hands over the title by squandering it's
award winning lead.
Upon the everyday canvas of life, a bizarre fighting ring is erected as a
stinging remedy/answer to it. I was (metaphorically) jumping out of my seat
and routing this picture on! Norton plays the stereotypical
materialistically-reassured yuppie with an atypically acute dose of
depression. Seeking some sense of purpose, he stumbles into a spectral
variety of support groups to which he becomes contentedly addicted until he
meets Brad Pitt. This is where the already powerful film shifts into
hyperdrive. Let's leave the plot line at that, shall we?
In the Tarantino spirit, this hard-hitting (at times plainly gory),
psychologically challenging film is also a comedy. Unfortunately, comedy
slips from this wondrously hybrid mix in rounds six through eight (reprising
in the ninth). Also, the motif of fists to flesh is slightly overdone.
Norton is great; Pitt, nothing less than mighty. Whether or not his
posterior is worshipped by half the population, Pitt is one of the greatest
actors of our time (and you can quote me on that).
"Fight Club" is simply rough and thick! Even though it loses punch during
its extended running time (about 2 hours 20 minutes), it is still a vibrant
contribution to the film world and has all the magnetically therapeutic
attraction to which cult-movie-goers will no doubt cling. "This is a good
life and it's ending one moment at a time." Enjoy it if you dare -- what are
you afraid of?

     Granted:  youšve never seen anything quite like FIGHT
CLUB.  Based on the cerebral, kick-ass novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, CLUB takes on a slew of issues, ranging from
materialism to moral decay.  It is visually stunning, quick,
smart, stimulating, a visceral powerhouse.  But, the film seems
to meander; too many themes bouncing off one another, priorities
misplaced, characters wandering aimlessly between brutal hand-
to-hand choreography and passive philosophizing.  Therešs
terrific material, here, let it be said -- just, a bit on the
disorganized side.
And, then I went back.  Had to; less intoxicated.  Bits
and pieces stuck with me as great, but not the whole, which
kind of baffled me since I absolutely loved the book.  Watching
a second time, the film is still scatterbrain.  Itšs also
spectacular cinema. Boldly directed by David Fincher (SEVEN is
one of the best, genre redefining, ever) -- a filmmaker who
consistently tests the limits of his medium -- FIGHT CLUB
focuses on insomniac every-man Narrator (Edward Norton, in a
performance that is nothing short of amazing) and his inadvertant
quest for self-improvement.  He starts with support groups, of
all disease and abnormality, where a hug from someone worse off
than you is just the thing for a good nightšs sleep.  Meets
Marla (a wild eyed Helena Bonham-Carter), who goes for the free
coffee, plus itšs less expensive than movies; a łfaker˛.  Then,
Tyler (another of our best and brightest, Brad Pitt), a social
nuisance who sells homemade soap at twenty bucks a bar to
finance militant uprising.  Narrator, or Jack, makes his most
resolute bond with Tyler; łHow much can you know about yourself
if youšve never been in a fight?˛  They beat the shit out of
each other, one night, in a parking lot and come to share the
same primal instinct:  emotional release via bodily harm.  As
Tyler puts it, you hit rock bottom when, and only if, you push
yourself physically beyond yourself, to rise above.  Spiritual
discovery, if you will; pain equals destruction, and destruction
equals awakening.  Hešs the rebellious alter ego to Jack, and
anyone for that matter daring enough to lose everything in order
to gain control.  Because, once youšve gotten low as you can
possibly get, the only direction is up.  Point taken.  That
perspective made him an intriguing character in Palahniukšs
brilliant novel, and it works, here, as well.
Both relationships mesmerize, and the ultra-faithful
script by Jim Uhlšs is quirky, witty and biting.  Not to mention
stunningly funny.  You can forget subtlety, though; FIGHT CLUBšs
grim and abrasive, virulent on top of its sometimes easy-goingness.
Wouldnšt have it any other way.  A łthree pitcher˛ bout amongst
friends draws attention, and quickly becomes Saturday night
ritual, relocated to bar basements where men join willingly to
pulverize one another.  No membership fees; each man, regardless
how worthless or respectable his lot in life, deific for a moment
or two of bare fisted suffering.  A sensation that turns into a
nationwide thing, existing łbetween the hours fight club starts
and the hours after fight club ends˛ according to Nortonšs droll,
eloquent voice-over.  Because, the first rule is... blah, blah.
Whatšs great about the novel (one thing, anyway) and here,
too, is that these savage little get togethers are a starting
place for something on more grand a scale.  Recruitment for
vandals and nihilists who believe łlosing all hope˛ is freedom.
Tyler starts Project Mayhem, and passes out homework assignments
which include initiating random fights.  Funny montage.  And,
how could you not like Jackšs contribution to the cause -- a
memorable scene, where Norton kicks his own ass before his
traumatized boss, leading to łcorporate sponsorship˛.
Itšs about damning the consumer mentality, getting a new
perspective, łfinding something out˛.  FC also has perhaps the
most playful story about the human psyche Išve ever seen, and
a realistic depiction of insomnia (ever had it, then you know).
łNothingšs real˛ is true; wastebasket contents and airplane food
take on a certain strange profound meaning.  łYoušre never really
asleep, and youšre never really awake˛, and hallucinations are
not unlikely.  Tyler may be one.  Jack may.  Lose sleep, days
on end, you get a distinct sense of futility, like nothing you
thought mattered really does.  You look for purpose; significance
in the world.  Anything to give yourself reprieve; God, Išve
been there.  Which is why Jack becomes a junkie to twelve-step
meetings.  Why he
listens to his inner misfit, gives his undivided attention (for
a while) and follows orders.  Seriously:  whenšs the last time
two sides of the same personality were this fully characterized?
Wasnšt sure how Fincher and team would pull off the infamous
plot twist, but... damn, job well done.  Allusion is perfection,
as with Jack thinking aloud during his solo tussle, łFor some
reason, I was reminded of my first fight with Tyler.˛  Marlašs
morning-after comment to Jack, łI can hardly believe anything
about last night.˛  A sex scene, in suspended animation, that
blurs the manšs face.  Or, one of Nortonšs very first lines in
the film:  łI know this, because Tyler knows this.˛  Fun stuff,
even if you already know whatšs going down.
Acting-wise?  What can you say..  Pittšs an experimentalist,
which fits in, whatever the project (MEET JOE BLACK excepted).
He takes risks, and you sense it every second hešs on screen.
Brit-beauty Carter -- accent gone, lady-like demeanor trashed --
isnšt so much in a performance, as a character sketch, but it
works.  I liked her scenes with Norton; the way he hasnšt caught
on, yet, and treats her by turns coldly and with affection.  She
doesnšt push it, or overplay.  Shešs manic, alright, but not out
of context.  Plus, as Marla, grunge never looked so delectable
(nor has it made me want a cigarette more in my life).  Then,
therešs Edward Norton.  Enough canšt be said about his work in
FIGHT CLUB, so Išll simply put it:  if no Academy notice comes
of what he has done in this film, consider the lot of them
unconscious.  He is out there, charismatic, assailable, naive,
alive with screen presence and non-assumption.  Beside giving
one of the best movie narrations (second only to Ray Liotta, in
GOODFELLAS), he nails every nuance of the character from
Palahniukšs scathing novel, and then some.  His scenes with
Carter, Jack defensive when Marla invades his space, are humorous
and kind of sexy.  They split up nights at therapy, so neither
gets exposed; he is resentful, because she sees through him,
and protective of his territory (łThis chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.˛) but drawn to her, also,
because shešs kindred.  Same respect:  Norton and Pitt have
chemistry to spare.  Much of their time spent is gruesome -- one
scene, with Pitt drizzling blood on a manšs face, is gory
beyond words; another, Norton pummeling a helpless youngster
into oblivion, features about the queasiest close-up of a mangled
face as I think Išve ever seen.  But, both stars shine in quieter
moments, like their first meeting on a plane, and later when
they make liposuctioned fat soap together.  Big names; no egos.
From its brain-tour opener (and BTW, one of these days,
cool title sequences are going to be refered to as Fincherian),
backed by a driving Dust Brothers selection, on, the furiously
entertaining FIGHT CLUB has masterpiece written all over it.
Unanswered questions?  You betšcha.  If Tyler knows what he is,
whatšs the ultimate goal?  Just cause chaos and/or remake Jack
from the inside out?  And, where _did_ Jack learn to make explosives
that way?  Was he born knowing it and didnšt realize or start
utilizing the technique till now, what?

     In this Year of Our Lord 1999, when all things millennial are hotter
than the coming Apocalyptic purges, I give you David Fincher -- official
filmmaker of the dark night of our collective 21st century soul.  SEVEN
was one of the decade's most chilling visions of societal madness made
flesh; THE GAME turned existential crisis into engrossing suspense.  No
one in popular culture seems to understand our demons better.  No one more
effectively shows the deceptive ease with which our stable world can be
yanked out from under us.
     In his adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's savagely brilliant novel FIGHT
CLUB, Fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche --
quite literally in the propulsive, Dust Brothers-scored opening credits
sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the
edge.  Our narrator (Edward Norton) is not unnamed without cause.  He's an
anonymous man driven to compulsive designer-label shopping and chronic
insomnia by a dehumanizing job (he investigates malfunctions for an auto
manufacturer, deciding whether a recall will be more expensive than paying
out-of-court personal injury settlements), a man who attends illness
support groups for cathartic release he can find nowhere else.  Then he
meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a man with a vision.  After an evening of
bonding during which they gleefully beat each other up, Tyler and the
narrator begin Fight Club, an underground organization where ordinary men
release their inner beasts through bare-knuckle brawls, and ... well, the
first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
     It might surprise a lot of people to discover that FIGHT CLUB is
actually a comedy.  Certainly it's not a comedy in the BIG DADDY or MICKEY
BLUE EYES sense, and not just because this one is actually funny.  It's a
comedy like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was a comedy, a social satire so caustic
you laugh with a sharp intake of breath.  Norton's wonderfully dry
narration includes dozens of scathing punch lines, many of them drawn
directly from Palahniuk's text.  Some of FIGHT CLUB's conceits are
outrageously inspired, like guerrilla theater projectionist Tyler splicing
single frames of pornography into family films, or the creation of
boutique soap from liposuctioned human fat ("We were selling rich ladies
their own asses back to them at $20 a bar").  As performed by Norton, a
perfectly manic Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter (the emotional burn-out who
becomes Tyler's lover), FIGHT CLUB is startlingly hilarious.
     And it had to be; there's no other way to tell a story like FIGHT
CLUB without wallowing in didacticism.  Many critics and social
conservatives have already offered up kill-the-messenger diatribes against
the film's brutality and anarchist sub-plots, yet another depressing
reminder that some people need their messages delivered to them in solemn
"isn't this a very, very bad thing" tones.  At its heart, FIGHT CLUB is a
warning about the percolating discontent that has exploded into
well-publicized acts of violence in this country.  It also peeks into the
capacity for violent action we may not even realize we possess, the
testosterone id bubbling beneath the veneer of civilization.  As Tyler
becomes a messiah for his disaffected devotees, FIGHT CLUB shows just how
quickly fascism can materialize when the rabble are roused.  If the
approach to those subjects had ever become overtly preachy, FIGHT CLUB
would have become a glossy social science dissertation -- a big screen
version of Susan Faludi's emasculated-American-male study "Stiffed."
Instead, FIGHT CLUB taps into something primal, then takes it into the
realm of the absurd -- subliminal penises, liposuction soap and all.
     Weaving it all together is Fincher, as distinctive and unconventional
a filmmaker as any working in mainstream theatrical films.  FIGHT CLUB is
a kinetic work with plenty of visual flourishes and jolting sound design,
yet it never feels like an all-out sensory pummeling -- it's the film
Oliver Stone probably wanted NATURAL BORN KILLERS to be, but lacked the
subtlety to pull of.  The film only sags during a late surge of
exposition, a necessary evil that still feels awkward.  When Fincher is
allowed to plunge into FIGHT CLUB's dizzying array of themes and subtexts,
the result is as provocatively entertaining a film as you could hope for.
If the violence unnerves -- or becomes even more unnerving when
accompanied by vicious wit -- that's only because it should.  FIGHT CLUB
keeps you off balance, its incendiary vision leavened by the unexpected
humor.  This time around, David Fincher gets to whistle in the dark night
of our collective 21st century soul.

FIGHT CLUB *** (out of four) 
-a review by Bill Chambers (fight@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk
directed by David Fincher
Some movie rags have reported that Fight Club's release date was
bumped from July to October to distance it from the Columbine
shootings. If that's true (director David Fincher says he just needed
more time to fine tune the editing), isn't Fox taking a step backward
by attaching to all Fight Club prints the trailer for Light it Up, a
film about a high school kid who tires of the dreaded "system" and
therefore takes his classmates hostage? Fight Club is very violent,
but Light it Up looks sensationalistic.  
Fight Club explores instead of exploiting. It never stops presenting
high-falutin' ideas. In some ways, the film is too existential to be
incendiary-you don't feel riled up by the closing credits, you feel
worn out, exhausted from playing headgames. 
The story is told through the eyes of Norton's nameless narrator (the
movie refers to him as Jack at times, so I will do the same here), a
flunky for an unidentified automaker by day, an insomniac always. Jack
spends entire evenings sifting through Ikea catalogues and staring
hopelessly at TV infomercials. He tells his physician he's miserable,
dying inside, but the doctor responds that if he really wants to know
about pain, he should meet with victims of testicular cancer. 
Jack actually visits a support group for such people, and their
stories cause him to weep uncontrollably. At last, feelings. A good
cry helps him sleep like a baby; soon, he becomes an eager tourist of
like meetings, but Marla (Carter), another phony who has begun making
the support group rounds for "free cake and coffee," interrupts his
good time. Maybe her beauty distracts him, or maybe he just can't deal
with his own lie reflected back, but Jack is made positively irate by
Marla's presence on his turf. 
He takes a break from the 12-step world for company trips, and on one
plane ride he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt-has he ever been this
magnetic?), a soap salesman with the gift of gab. They exchange
business cards, and when Jack returns home to find his apartment
bombed out (the stove's pilot light was left on), he calls Tyler.
Three pitchers of beer later, Jack has a place to stay. 
Tyler introduces him to a seedier life. In Jack's new digs, the
electricity must be turned off during a rainstorm. The shower runs
brown water. The staircase could collapse at any moment. But this is
to his delight: for once, he's not slave to his stuff-expensive
furnishings and appliances. (Tyler tells him, "We don't own things,
the things own us.") 
Tyler offers Jack another release through fighting. What starts out as
a few innocuous swings at one another in a parking lot turns into an
underground sensation, with various disillusioned men meeting one
night of the week in the basement of a dive to scrap. (Tyler, in
essence, extols the virtues of nihilism.) Marla disrupts Jack's
happiness again, though, when she worms her way back into his life
through a sexual relationship with Tyler. 
After only three films (Alien3, Se7en, The Game), Fincher has
developed a distinct style-there is a consistent tone running through
his filmography which could be weakly characterized as "bleak".
Certainly, his works are linked by visual motifs, such as the most
piercing flashlights this side of Spielberg, dank locales, flash
frames, and low angles. (His technique is a bit more playful this time
around; his acknowledgment of the medium itself in one scene is
downright postmodern.) Fight Club also recalls The Game in its second
half as Jack's reality changes and he no longer knows who is
trustworthy. 
But Fincher's past examinations of identity crisis (consider also
Se7en's villain) were emotionally hard-hitting, and while Fight Club
should be applauded for going out on a philosophical limb (much is
made of Jack and Tyler's yin yang dynamic, as symbolized by Jack's
table, and how violence will turn you into a drone as much as sitting
under the fluorescent lights in a cubicle might), it is unmoving.
Cynicism gets in the way at the start, when we're asked to laugh at
truly pitiable characters, including Meat Loaf's sympathetic cancer
survivor (the camera keeps lingering on his large, feminine breasts).
(Other jokes go over better.) When the narrative shifts gears to
Marla's subplot, we learn that she's a burnout (hardly the femme
fatale the ads would have you believe), and little else. She exists to
inform us about Jack, so we vest little interest in their
relationship. 
By film's end, so many concepts and plot twists have been thrown our
way that we're left dizzy at best. The final shot is a feast for the
eyes and ears, but Fincher denies us what Jack wants and periodically
achieves: catharsis. Fight Club is a darkly comic work of crazed
genius (I'd call it cinematic pop art), but its punches aim for the
head, not the heart.

"Fight Club" is a challenging piece of work, a film demanding that its
viewers look past what's on its surface and find something deeper. Certainly
those not used to thinking critically about a film will either be put off by
"Fight Club's" violence or completely buy into the hackneyed philosophy of
its most visible character, Tyler Durden. Both of these reactions are
understandable, but also miss the point. "Fight Club" is not glorifying
violence at all; rather, it's actually a kind of morality play, one whose
central character struggles with two conflicting visions of society, neither
of which seems particularly desirable. Though it may be shocking, and will
certainly be controversial, "Fight Club" is rewarding to those willing to
take an honest look at society. Director David Fincher has created a modern
fable, one that's both confused in its message and shocking in its final
realization.
The film centers on a nameless character, called the Narrator (Edward
Norton, who is called "Jack" once or twice, but is most often not referred
to by name), an insomniac who works a boring job deciding whether or not
products should be recalled (read: whether or not it's cost-effective).
Desperate to cure his insomnia, he asks for medication from a doctor, who
sarcastically tells him to go to a support group for men with testicular
cancer "to see what real suffering is like." The Narrator goes to the group,
surprisingly finding that crying in the embrace of men with "bitch tits"
(you'll know it when you see it) actually helps him sleep. He signs up for
all sorts of support groups, attending each under a different name, faking
illness. It works right up until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a
chain-smoking fellow "support group tourist," ruins the Narrator's plan.
Since Jack can't cry in the presence of another "faker," his insomnia
returns. He comes upon another solution when he meets a mysterious soap
salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler's idea is that men are being
stifled by modern society, which is too "feminizing," not allowing men a
chance to release their aggression. His solution? For Jack to hit him, and
have the two proceed to beat each other to a bloody pulp. This ritual soon
evolves into a weekly club (called Fight Club, appropriately) in which other
men in Jack's situation find their release by fighting strangers in the
basement underneath a seedy bar.
"Fight Club" is an exhilarating rush, a wild roller-coaster of energy that
doesn't let up. Whatever one may think of its philosophy, one can certainly
agree that the film is never boring. Director David Fincher, who showed a
great visual flair in "Seven" and "The Game," pulls out all the stops here,
and the result is a dizzying experience. His style represents the best of
post-MTV filmmaking, with a camera that explores anything and everything in
each scene, often indicating a sly sense of humor on the director's part.
The early scenes take some funny and on-target jabs at 90's society, and
Fincher's visual style compliments that quite well. He includes a scene in
which Norton strolls around his apartment, and each piece of furniture is
labeled with a price and description, like in a magazine catalogue. A
breaking-of-the-fourth-wall sequence in which Tyler, working as a
projectionist in a movie theater, splices single-frame shots of porn into
family movies, is by far the most clever, and actually serves as a trick to
clue the audience in to what is going on. Here's a hint: Look very closely
at the opening scenes, and the final shot, just before the closing credits.
If you miss it, don't worry, you're sure to register it subliminally . . .
The performances in "Fight Club" are uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt delivers
his most assured and daring performance since "12 Monkeys," and Edward
Norton delivers further proof that he may be one of the best actors of his
generation. Helena Bonham Carter, in a strange departure from her earlier
period films, has a whole lot of fun with her relatively small, but not
unimportant role. Meat Loaf, a former rock signer, does a fine supporting
turn, despite being saddled with unusually large breasts (in one of the film
's more bizarre sight gags). The actors are perfectly cast. It's difficult
to imagine anyone else playing Pitt's and Norton's parts, and every
performer has clearly thrown himself (or herself, in Bonham Carter's case)
into the role. Fincher must be credited for getting the most out of his
actors, which is usually an added plus for directors who concentrate on
visuals. With David Fincher, it's almost become expected.
This is a daring film, and as with most daring films, there is a danger of
many people missing the point. "Fight Club" is no different. Those unwilling
to look any deeper may see Tyler's philosophy as dangerously fascist and
nihilistic, a call for random violence and the destruction of civilization
as we know it. There's very little doubt that Tyler is advocating these
things, but the film is not. "Fight Club" is not so much an endorsement of
fascism as an allegory for it. If one takes Tyler's message to be the film'
s, then "Fight Club" will most likely be utterly repulsive, and downright
ludicrous once Tyler recruits members from around the nation for the next
step of Fight Club, called Project Mayhem. Certainly a bunch of "space
monkeys" running around in black masks and planning to blow up all the
credit card companies is not a reasonable solution to the country's
problems, but look at the irony of what Tyler's army becomes. "Fight Club"
is certainly critical of 90's culture, as its Narrator works a mind-numbing
job in which he recites corporate slogans about "de-prioritizing" this and
making these his "primary action" whatchamacallits, while he becomes a
sleepwalking drone. This is definitely no way to live a fulfilling life, but
Tyler's Project Mayhem group is no better. Its members can eventually do
little more than recite "Tyler-isms" and follow orders, essentially becoming
mindless drones of another sort, the only difference being that they are now
drones following a wildly different dogma from the corporate one. Is this
presented as an ideal? I think not.
The screenplay, written by Jim Uhls and adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's
novel, is sharp and fast-paced, with clever dialogue and sly jokes to spare.
In fact, the only fault I can find with "Fight Club" is that it comes
dangerously close to running itself around in circles in the last 30
minutes. This is a possible case of David Fincher's apparent desire to have
a mind-bending plot twist at the end of every one of his movies (remember
"Seven" and "The Game?"). "Fight Club's" twist isn't just unnecessary (the
film could have worked without it), but it comes far too early, and it keeps
on twisting until the final scene, when it almost comes unraveled. The twist
isn't really awful, and it works if you think about it, but it causes "Fight
Club" to become too plot-oriented during its final act, whereas it had been
about mood and philosophy early on. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't ruin
the film. After all, "Fight Club" is a risk-taker, and films that take risks
often have problems like this. An overly "plot-twisty" (look, ma, I invented
a word!) finish doesn't change the fact that the film is a challenging and
impressive work. One thing is for sure, my interest didn't wane at any point
during the film.
I know that a whole lot of people are going to buy into the words of Tyler
Durden, to them I say to be careful, because this film is not telling anyone
to do the things he advocates. Tyler's philosophy smacks too much of
fascism, leaves no room for moderation, which indicates what the film is
actually calling for: balance. (The final sequence would seem to suggest
this.) Tyler and Jack are right: The men in Calvin Klein underwear ads are
not real men. The members of Project Mayhem, however, are not what men
should aspire to be. They are not intelligent beings; they are robots. Tyler
demonstrates how Hitler rose to power, by finding disgruntled members of
society and convincing them that someone else is the source of all their
problems. Such clear allegory to one of the darkest periods in world history
indicates that this film is in actuality a cautionary tale. Much like the
initially misunderstood "A Clockwork Orange" before it, "Fight Club" is a
warning that if society suppresses man's more primal urges too much, it will
pay the consequences. As a study of how a crazed, but charismatic leader can
lead followers to violence, it's a frightening study indeed.

Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter. Rated R.
Pre-release buzz is not directly proportionate to film quality. Take
two recent films, for example: The Blair Witch Project and Fight Club.
Both were hyped tremendously; the former was touted as the scariest
film of all time while the latter was supposedly a sure-fire Oscar
contender. Well, all I can say is no frickin' way. Blair Witch,
contrary to what some cretins claimed, was barely even creepy and Fight
Club, well...
It is exceedingly difficult to give a brief synopsis of the plot, which
is busy and convoluted, becoming less and less linear as it rambles
along. I'll wind up describing it in detail, so if you don't want that
much information you might as well skip the next three paragraphs.
Consider yourself warned. Ś For those of y'all who have decided to
remain for my makeshift plot description, listen carefully. We meet
Jack (Edward Norton), the man who is to guide us through the rest of
the movie. Jack is a troubled soul, an insomniac who takes solace in
going to support groups he doesn't belong to, just so he can cry and
get his true feelings out. He is hampered by his soul-deadening job and
joyless existence; he spends his free time trying to figure out which
piece of Ikea merchandise defines him as a person.
Everything changes in one weird day. On a plane he meets Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt), an angry-at-the-world soap salesman who leaves an
impression on him. When he returns to his condo, he finds that it has
exploded. How no one seems to know. For some reason, he calls up Tyler,
who agrees to let Jack stay with him at his old, beaten-up shack of a
home. In the parking lot one day, Tyler encourages Jack to hit him as
hard as he can. This leads to a fight. Before Jack knows it, he and
Tyler have started an underground fight club, in which men like Jack
(i.e. opressed by society) can take their anger out by kicking the crap
out of others. Jack and Tyler make up rules, homework assignments and
the like and their endeavor becomes unexpectedly popular, with
franchises reportedly starting up all over the country.
Before long, the fight club turns into "Project Mayhem," a sinister
organization of brainwashed drones all working toward a secret goal
unknown to Jack. Jack wants out, but is he in too deep?
My main problem with Fight Club is that its mood and screenplay suggest
an important film with something socially significant to say when in
reality it's paper-thin stuff. It's alleged message about men following
their primal instincts crumbles and falls apart when subjected to the
slightest of scrutiny. In fact, what this film tries to say is
prepostrous: men are "womanized" by Ikea and office work and respond by
releasing their suppresed anger in the form of violence. Is the movie
glorifying this?
Just because the film is hollow doesn't mean it's bad. But to be
worthwhile without being significant means that it has to be a viable
thriller. It's a diverting one because of its offbeat tone and pacing,
but it isn't good. Plot elements make no sense, especially when the
film's big secret is revealed. There is a similarity to The Sixth Sense
in the surprise ending, but that film made it work because it remained
consistent while Fight Club's ending does nothing but create plot holes
big enough to drive a Zamboni through.
One thing I can wholeheartedly praise in Fight Club is the
performances, which are outstanding. Edward Norton once again proves
his ability to mold into any role given to him. Brad Pitt, at last, has
the opportunity to impress us and he capitalizes. I've never liked the
actor; I always thought that he made his characters dull and
uninteresting with his mannerisms. Here, he is effectively menacing in
a bizarre role, clearly trying to make the most of a chance to revive
his lackluster career (he hasn't had a hit since Se7en).
This is an engrossing, entertaining movie, original, visually kinetic
and viscerally exciting. But you can show me as many weird and creative
styles and ideas as you want, if you have nothing to say you result
remains nothing more than a cheeky game, a piece of subversive nothing.

Fight Club
Rating (out of five): ****1/2
Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, Jared
Leto and Zach Grenier
Directed by David Fincher
Written by Jim Uhls (based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk)
Rated R for violence, profanity, sexual situations and subliminal nudity
Theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1
Released in 1999
Running 139 minutes
For years, director David Fincher has been turning out some of the most
stylish and inventive thrillers to ever hit American screens. In spite of
critical and public backlash, his Alien 3 remains the most technically
interesting of that series, and Se7en stands as the suspense film upon which
all other modern suspense films are gauged. With The Game, he proved himself
more than a one-movie-wonder and emerged as one of the most original
filmmakers working in Hollywood. Which brings us to Fight Club, Fincher's
most unnerving and stylized outing yet.
By now, anyone who follows the entertainment business by even a slight
degree has heard of the controversy surrounding Fincher's latest. With most
publicists focusing on the film's unflinchingly violent and blood-soaked
fight scenes, most viewers would be led to believe (myself included) that
it's nothing more than a handful of starkly realistic bar brawls, and
nothing you couldn't see during one night at your local pub.
Well, take all that you think you know about Fight Club and leave it at the
theater door. With as many twists and turns as Se7en and The Game put
together, this is a wholly exuberant and unique experience, and not at all
what you would expect from the previews. Yes, there are numerous graphic
depictions of bare-knuckled fist fights, but they are never exploitive or
glorifying at all, contrary to what you probably have heard. Whilst the
participants in the fight are crying tears of joy and sharing a supposed
male-bonding experience by letting there killer instincts surface, us
movie-goers in the audience are busy wincing at the notion of such
bloodshed. Unlike most Hollywood action pictures that make violence look
exhilarating, Fight Club, if anything, sets to rest any desire you have to
get in a fight; it ain't pretty.
Edward Norton stars as a conformed, white-collar working man who finds this
out too late. Never given a name (let's call him Jack), he symbolizes the
corporate everyman, so choked by his own mundane existence that he often
gets the primal urge to tear free from his barriers (in some extended quips,
Norton, as narrator, makes some of the most blistering comments on modern
consumer life since the great monologues in Trainspotting). And tears free
he does, once he hooks up with a mysterious figure named Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt), a soap manufacturer, theater projectionist and part-time waiter. With
his anecdotes of splicing frames of pornography into family films and
masturbating into fresh clam chowder, it becomes clear that Durden is the
exact counterpart to Jack; a laid-back anarchist who has plans of,
eventually, actually doing something about uptight mindless masses and
setting the world free of itself.
After getting into a rumble with Jack (and liking the effects), he devises
Fight Club, an underground organization consisting exclusively of men who
come together a few times a week to, without any loftier purpose, beat each
other to a bloody pulp. What better way to rage against society's standards
and explore yourself, eh? Soon, Fight Club evolves into something much
larger, something that Jack no longer has even a small amount of control
over. What is Tyler really up to? Is there more to the guy than first meets
the eye?
There's so much more to discuss here and many more subplots to get into
(notice I haven't once made mention of Helena Bonham Carter's character?),
but doing so would inevitably detract from your Fight Club experience. That
said, I do think it's pretty safe to say that the film is much more powerful
and profound than the basic plot outline would suggest. In addition to the
natural instincts of man, Fight Club also delves into such topics as
manipulation, cultism, communism, fascism and even the psychosemantics of
the human id and ego, and explores them all equally, all the while
sustaining the excitement and hyper-kinetics of an effective thriller. I
could have done with a less ambiguous ending (which accounts for the
subtraction of a half-star), but as it stands, Fight Club is bound to rank
as one of the year's best.

As any reasonable human being would, I must admit that occasionally I am
befuddled by certain things. I am befuddled by Fight Club. Now sometimes our
favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success
until much later, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later.  Perhaps
it is because these films are way ahead of their time. Perhaps it is because
they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink
in do we truly appreciate and understand them. Fight Club is either garbage
or brilliant, but, at least right now, I must lean toward the former.
Maybe I am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly
leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold. But if
it is, I sure donšt see it.
Edward Norton plays Jack, a field examiner for a major automobile
manufacturer. His insomnia, coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his
world with IKEA furniture to łcomplete˛ himself, make him a loser at the
game of life. But when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th
story window, he seeks comfort in a stranger, Tyler (Pitt) whom he met on a
flight home. Once Jack is sucked into Tyleršs world, he canšt get out,
literally. They begin Fight Club, an organization based on brutal and bloody
fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a
sense of belonging. As the Fight Club grows, things get out of control and
take on cult status, beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth
by standing still outside Tyleršs house for three days. I dare not even
begin to bring up the last quarter of the film, since that contains the
twist that łexplains˛ the pointless journey.
Suffice it to say I was truly disappointed in Fincher, whošs previous two
films, Se7en and The Game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant
young filmmakers of the next generation. This is not to imply by any means
that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to
the table. But with Fight Club, he has allowed his unique talent for
extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and
self-referencing film elements, such as talking to the audience about what
they are seeing, telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner
are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly
altered recurring line is good łflashback humor˛.
Now, throughout the filmšs coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot
lines, Fight Club is obviously trying to make various social comments about
the state of the world today. Advertisements, inter-office politics,
corporations, you name it, itšs addressed. (Though the media are
suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced.) All of them
play an important role. How so? Well, I can kinda just tell. I canšt really
put my finger on it. To say that Starbucks and Barnes & Noble are taking
over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no
big news. Is that bad for the world? Probably. Not much room for social
commentary there. We all know that inter-office politics are just
that...politics. So what was the point of all this? The film seems desperate
to make a point, or a number of points, but I couldnšt figure out what they
were.
All I saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film
techniques, a bleak visual design and some fine acting. (Pitt, Carter,
Norton...all of them are good. Even Meatloaf is good.) When you get to the
end, you will most likely be filled with questions, many of which the
filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself. Not them, because each of them
would likely give you a different answer. Fight Club means what you want it
to mean, I think Fincher just gives you the stuff to think about. But it
couldnšt be more bizarre and unappealing. Sure, it had shock value, but so
did Se7en and The Game, and they were significantly stronger films.

David Fincher's latest cold, bleak, depressing masterpiece is a 139-
min. adrenaline rush.  It's a film that stabs you in the heart with a
rusty knife and then sprays it with 100% proof alcohol.  A film that
goes straight for the jugular and leaves you gasping for its entire
run.  And did I mention how funny this macabre comedy is?
Based on Chuck Palahniuk's intensely provocative first novel of the
same name and armed with the most innovative visual techniques, jaw-
droppingly superb performances from its stars, and a darkly satirical &
original screenplay, `Fight Club' has convinced me that it's one of the
best films of the decade.
Hype for this film has been incredibly high and so have the stakes for
everyone involved.  The book has become a cult classic and rightfully
so.  Having read the novel myself, I can honestly say the movie is as
good, if not better than the book.  The brilliant wordplay, the
monologues, its originality, all have been brought to life and Fincher
has brought them to the next level after that.  David Fincher's career
peaks with this film, with `Fight Club' he becomes the best director at
combining style and substance and never has it been done this well.
Fincher has also gotten the best performances out of all his players.
Edward Norton gives another heavily audacious performance as the
everyman Narrator and once again proves he is one of the most versatile
actors working in Hollywood today.  Not only that, but Brad Pitt is
back, going all out in anti-mainstream mode as Tyler Durden, delivering
his best performance to date.  And Helena Bonham Carter portrays her
sardonic character with such deadpan panache that if she doesn't get an
Oscar nomination in February; I'll be bitching for a very long time.
`Fight Club' starts out as a film about a group of yuppies that start a
club where each week they take their aggressions out on each other by
way of fights.  However, that's only the beginning.  Later on, Tyler
takes Fight Club up a notch with Project Mayhem, a terrorist group that
rebels against society in many ways.   Their antics get more and more
extreme, right up until its climax where the film peaks.   Unlike many
other films, the film's ending is very satisfying.  `Fight Club'
doesn't end abruptly with no conclusion, it doesn't end with a
predictable twist, it ends with a nice dark ending.
To tell you any more about the plot would be wrong of me, so stop
reading any reviews and go see `Fight Club', the best film I've seen
all year.

"Fight Club" Review
by Fontaine Lien
WARNING: You do NOT want to know the ending to this movie.  Stop reading
NOW if you have NOT seen the movie yet!
Wow.  Just when I thought all hope was lost for the fall movie season of
1999 (well, I had high hopes for "American Beauty" but my stupid friend
ruined my plans by telling me the ending).  "Fight Club" is a stylish,
testosterone-charged look at the mind of a man gone haywire, complete
with thought-provoking commentaries on modern society.  I'm more
appreciative now than ever that the folks who made the trailer did not
leave any hints as to what the movie was really about; it would have
ruined everything. 
It starts with an explosion of sound and neurotransmissions and leads
right into the conclusion of the film, like plunging us all into ice
cold water without forewarning.  Everything else is flashback from
there.  Without wasting any time at all we are introduced to the
character of Jack (Edward Norton), a white-collar yuppie slowly
wasting away due to insomnia.  We're drowning in his poetic narrative
and some of the best dialogue to come out of Brad Pitt in years.  The
scenes are like the ebb and flow of the tide; some are overwhelmingly
powerful and some seem to exist for none other than stylistic reasons.
Somehow I don't give a damn as long as Norton keeps talking and the
camera keeps doing that thing it does.  Shiftng out of focus and
shivering.  Freezing in place and moving abruptly forward.  The
"Matrix" and some other things.  For example, I love the shot in the
very beginning where camera moves down to the van parked in the
basement.  Impressive camerawork overall.  The all-out effects
delicately balanced out Norton's narrative, giving it just enough
oomph but not taking effect away from it.  I mentioned that Norton's
voice-over was like poetry; in fact the entire film is Homeresque in
its scale and beauty.  It's not afraid to do things that haven't been
done before, to laugh at itself with its twisted sense of humor (yes,
it *is* very funny).
Pitt and Norton prove a superb duo (in a movie that is all about the
interaction between Jack and Tyler); it's nice to see Pitt and Helena
Bonham Carter throw away their images and throw themselves into their
eccentric roles.  Norton, however, holds up the bulk of the movie and
proves that he earned that Oscar nomination.  If "The People vs. Larry
Flynt" and "Rounders" didn't make him a star, this movie will.  Don't
be fooled by Pitt's top billing.  It's all about Ed this time.
One friend, deceived by the film's title (as I was), claimed that if
he wanted to go see a film about men fighting, he'd see a Jean-Claude
Van Damme movie.  Well, as anyone who's see "Fight Club" can tell you;
the "Fight" has nothing to do with the theme, at least not directly.
Yes, there are a lot of fights, but all staged to illustrate a central
theme.  The beauty of "Fight Club" is when you look back, when the
movie is winding down to a halt, at everything that happened, you
realize that all parts coalasce to become a whole, and everything
clicks into place.  Without all of its individual parts the tale would
not be whole.  It's intriguing, and it makes you want to watch the
entire movie again just to see its genius and foreshadowing at work.
"The Sixth Sense," anyone (I haven't actually seen the movie yet, I
just read an article in Entertainment Weekly :)?  It's like one of
those riddles that give you a crime scene and ask you to find out how
the victim died.
I've heard the aforementioned EW doesn't like this movie.  They say
it's senselessly violent.  I think they're missing the point.  Yes,
there is a lot of violence in this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it
to young children; but is it senseless?  Is the movie rendered
pointless because in the end, we find out that Tyler never even
existed?  That he was just Jack's alter- ego in his fantasies?  Some
say by writing Jack into a lunatic you destroy the whole purpose of
the movie.  I say it only adds layers of meaning.  It's about a man's
struggle with his inner voice and his ideas that are being suffocated
by upper-middle-class monotony.  On the outside, his suits are crisp,
clean, white as snow; his behavior impeccable, his choice in furniture
excellent.  Inside, as the film shows us, he is turbulent.  And this
is where the violence comes in.  It is terrible, but it is definitely
not senseless.  It serves to illustrate a point, to develop Jack's
character.
I cannot help but wonder, however, if the film wouldn't be better if
it had just ended with Jack dying.  That ending would've felt more in
tune with the rest of the movie.  This one feels fine too; I couldn't
have asked for anything more beautiful and poignant.  Jack's still
screwed up, but he found someone just as screwed up as he is.  In the
end we're not only shaken by the look into our materalistic lives but
we've also gotten a haunting and penetrating look into the mind of an
"ordinary man."
* The only reason I didn't give the movie an A+ is because they blew up
Apple computers.  Hey, stop snickering!

Featuring an acting tours de force by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, FIGHT
CLUB, the much anticipated film by director David Fincher (SEVEN),
proves worthy of its hype.  Although not for everyone due to its
pervasive strong violence, the mesmerizing film shocks, delights and
surprises the viewers at every turn.
Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the brightly written script by Jim
Uhls literally bursts with memorable lines that will have you laughing
and thinking.  The story, which makes Kafka look like an optimist,
concerns an underground chain of fight clubs.  The parallels to Nazi
Germany and the brown shirts are obvious.
When we meet Jack (Norton, who is also the narrator), he's an insomniac
trying to find something to do with his life.  "I flipped though
catalogs and wondered what kind of dining set defines me as a person,"
he tells us.  With the help of a plethora of mail order catalogs, he is
able to fully define himself in terms of all of his material
possessions.
In easily the funniest sequence in the movie, Jack seeks meaning though
self-help groups.  He goes to ones for various forms of cancer, among
others.  No one questions whether he should be there.  "Every evening I
died, and every evening I was born again," he says of the effect on him
of the motivational speakers at the meetings.  "When people think you're
dying, they really, really listen to you," he explains as one of his
reasons for regular attendance.
Upsetting his world is an interloper named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter), who crashes his meetings.  She goes for the free food, not the
sympathy, but it spoils it for him once she shows up.
His life really changes when he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt).  Tyler, a free-spirit, a modern urban terrorist and a
seductive conman, is such a memorable character that you may never again
be able to meet someone named Tyler without thinking of Tyler Durden.
Norton and Pitt are perfectly cast.  Norton, a brilliant acting
chameleon, becomes a canonical office worker who is bored stiff with his
job and his life.  Pitt, born to be a rebel, plays a character with the
inverse of Jack's traits.
"This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time," the
philosophical Tyler tells Jack.  Ridiculing Jack's possession obsession,
Tyler lectures him, "The things you own end up owning you."  The movie
repeats this message so often that you almost expect an endorsement on
the marquee from Anarchist International.
The fight club from which the movie gets its name starts off innocently
enough.  Like a couple of kids on the playground, Tyler wants to trade
licks with Jack outside of a bar.
This rapidly gets out of hand.  They start meeting regularly, attracting
other members who want to get pounded.  Jack starts showing up at work
with massive bruises and cuts as if he were getting into a series of
progressively worse car accidents.
The movie takes one surprising twist and turn after another.  One of the
wildest episodes has Jack and Tyler raiding a liposuction clinic.
Filled with sadomasochistic desires, the guys are soon looking for more
pain than the traditional fight club can provide.  Be prepared to look
at the floor a lot during some of the movie's gory scenes.  "It's only
after we have lost everything that we're free to do everything," Tyler
explains as his credo to justify his savagery.
Filled with Nihilist humor, the film is vicious and viciously funny.
"On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to
zero," Tyler points out to justify his random acts of cruelty.
(In a bit of life reflecting art, I left the big city screening room in
which I saw the movie and went to use a payphone on the street.  An
angry, tough-looking guy threatened to beat the crap -- he used another
term -- out of me for using "his" payphone.  I said I was sorry.  Tyler
would not have approved.)
After seeming to have run out of ideas, the film's ending turns out
instead to be its creative high point.  It's the sort of film that will
leave you exhausted but glad you came.
FIGHT CLUB runs way too long at 2:20.  It is rated R for disturbing and
graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and
language.  It should have been rated NC-17 and is not appropriate for
teenagers unless they are older and can handle extremely horrific
images.

"The Fight Club" is ordinarily the kind of film I would stay away
from. The only reason I went is that it thematically related to
"American Beauty" and would serve as a useful counterpoint in
preparing this review. It seemed over-hyped and, even worse, starred
the odious Brad Pitt. Although I found the film nearly unwatchable, it
certainly did satisfy in terms of documenting the current scene in the
United States through the peculiar perspective of the young director
David Fincher and the screenplay based on the novel of Chuck
Palahniuk.
The central character in this film, who remains nameless and who is
played by Edward Norton, is very much like Lester Burnham. He is
trapped in the corporate world and finds himself increasingly
dissatisfied with the fruits it is supposed to deliver. He works for
an automobile company as a risk assessor. His job is to prepare
technical reports on accidents involving his company's products. If it
cost more money to fix a car rather than pay off successful claimants
in suits against the company, the company opts for not making the
necessary changes to make the car safe.
Norton's character leads an unfulfilled and aimless life. Rather than
masturbating as an outlet, he buys furniture from Ikea. His entire
apartment is covered with tables, chairs, lamps and sofas ordered from
their catalog, which also appears to be his only reading material. He
also suffers from insomnia for which the only cure seems to come in
the form of going to self-help groups for terminal diseases like
testicular cancer or tuberculosis. The emotional confessions of the
participants gives him a vicarious sense of being alive, which then
allows him to sleep soundly. While he enjoys good health, he is closer
to death than the people he communes with on a nightly basis. They
face physical mortality at any moment. He faces spiritual mortality
every moment of his waking life.
On an airplane ride to visit an accident site on behalf of his
company, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who is everything he is
not. Brash, self-confident and dressed like a pimp, Durden describes
himself as a soap salesman but he gives every indication of leading a
darker existence. The Norton character finds himself drawn to Durden.
When he arrives back at his apartment building, he discovers police
cars and fire trucks on the scene as flames pour from the windows of
his apartment. His precious Ikea furniture and all his belongings have
been destroyed in a mysterious explosion, possibly the result of a
pilot light having failed on his stove.
Since Durden gave him his business card on the plane, he decides to
call him up. In the back of his mind, he considers staying with him
until finding a more permanent residence. The two men meet for drinks
at a seedy bar and continue the conversation they had on the plane.
Basically, Durden puts forth a critique of consumerist society that is
absolute to the point of being monomaniacal. There is nothing more
evil in this world view than shopping and status-seeking.
After they have had several pitchers of beer, they leave the bar and
continue talking in the parking lot. Out of the blue, Durden asks the
Norton character to punch him. There is no particular reason for this,
but he accommodates him. Whereupon Durden punches him back and the two
men trade blows until they fall to the ground bloody and exhausted.
Meanwhile, a group of men from the bar stand in a circle around them
both entertained and bemused. Why are the two men, who appear to be
friends, pounding each other into senselessness? Eventually other men
follow in their path and a fight club becomes a regularly scheduled
event in the basement of the bar.
While the film does not really take the trouble to explore through
dialog the appeal such pointless violence has for these men, it
obvious that we are dealing with violence as a form of existential
authenticity. Men--and it is men we are talking about--feel trapped in
a meaningless existence. To transcend the emptiness of such existence,
the only release seems to be the feel of a punch in the nose and the
sight of blood pouring from it, either your own or your opponent's. In
many ways, this message is simply a recycling of the theme of Camus'
"The Stranger", whose existentially unrealized French Algerian
character discovers authenticity through the murder of an Arab on the
beach, whom he has never met. It also evokes "Clockwork Orange," whose
teenaged rebels inflict random violence on peaceful citizens in order
to protest the social control of a well-engineered and well-controlled
society of the future. "The Fight Club" would seem to be saying that
such a world exists today.
Eventually fight clubs spring up around the United States and begin to
mutate into nihilistic bands of black clad militia types with shaved
heads, who attack symbols of consumer society. In a very telling
scene, evocative of recent events in Seattle, they send an immense
globular corporate sculpture crashing into a Starbucks coffee bar. The
revolution of fight club activists is designed to destroy modern
society, not transform it into a positive alternative. This is not far
removed from the vision of the Unabomber and the intellectuals like
Kirkpatrick Sale and John Zerzan who provide spin-doctoring services
for him.
Where "The Fight Club" fails as both cinema and as effective social
commentary is in its total lack of engagement with the ideas that
might propel these men into such an extreme posture. While one would
not expect a film to include the sort of psychological and political
analysis of Dostoyevsky's "The Possessed", its total absence leaves
the viewer with an inability to understand their motivations. It is
simply not sufficient to state that all of a sudden men find
themselves willing to be beaten into senselessness as an escape.
Anybody who has been beaten up, and I speak from personal experience,
does not go through such an experience as a lark. In contrast
"Clockwork Orange" is filled with characters explaining why they
commit random acts of terror. Their words, drawn from Anthony
Burgess's capable prose, are indeed what makes the film successful.
Whatever the flaws of the film, it is a useful snapshot of American
society at a peculiar juncture in its unfolding as an empire. In the
final years of the second term of the Clinton administration, which by
some standards has produced more material success than has been
enjoyed in many years, Hollywood is turning out films that curse the
system that produced it.

Few movies in 1999 polarized audiences like "Fight Club", which showed Gen-X
men beating on each other as a way of attempting to reclaim their
masculinity, or something.  Three camps seem to have sprung up around the
film: hose who love it, those who hate it, and those who find the other two
camps wasting their time with a red herring.  I'm in the third camp.
"Fight Club", at the very least, opens brilliantly, with an unnamed narrator
(Edward Norton) going stir crazy in a homogenized job.  The film gets a lot
of good mileage out of Norton's disgust with his brand-name existence; I was
reminded of Willy Loman ranting, "How can they whip cheese?".  In this film,
Norton paces through his apartment, obssing over housewares catalogues,
while his Ikea-bought furniture all handily display closed-captioned
pricetags and manufacturer's descriptions.
Norton is an insomniac, and winds up going to terminal-disease support
groups as a coping mechanism.  For what, we may ask?  For the fact that his
life is terminally pallid?  How bad can his life be when there are people
dying of brain cancer?  That's the way he thinks about it, anyway, and for a
while it works, until he meets another faker, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter).  Marla and the Norton character wind up involved in a tempestuous
relationship, which in this movie is a little like saying the Eiffel Tower
is tall and pointy.
Things get complicated further by the presence of the handsome and engimatic
soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), whom Norton meets on one of his
unending business trips.  Durden seems to have a knack for telling people
what they've always wanted to hear but could never find anyone else to say.
This is exactly what Norton thinks he needs, and when he comes back one day
to find his apartment blown up, he shacks up with Durden in a house that
could only remain standing in the movies and starts plowing through his back
copies of "Reader's Digest".
So far the film has been funny and knowing, and made with great skill.  Then
it takes a left turn that sends everything barrelling over the cliff.
Durden, as it turns out, is the mastermind of an underground boxing circle
known as Fight Club, where the male disenfranchised can come and feel like
gods while beating the tar out of each other.  The logic of this will be
lost on anyone who has actually been in a fistfight, of course, but the
movie is not about logic.  "Fight Club" has the peculiar, subterranean
arrogance of a precocious writer's first draft, where screwy little details
are defended to death over massive plot holes.
Before long Fight Club is running completely out of control, and Durden and
Norton are at each other's throats when they're not raiding liposuction
clinics for human fat.  The parallels with the Nazis are of course not going
to be lost on a knowing audience, but by the time we get to such things,
they no longer matter.
I suspect "Fight Club" worked better on paper, because what's on film veers
between the nauseating and the ridiculous.  It's one thing to write about
how great it felt to smash your fists into the concrete over and over again,
and quite another to actually SEE it.  Film has a way of literalizing
everything, even things that are designed to be fanciful, and perhaps this
story (from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk) just didn't survive the translation
intact.
People will say (and have said) that the film is actually "about the nature
of violence", but that is approximately as honest as saying that "ID4" was
"about" the value of raising funding for SETI.  The movie isn't genuinely
smart enough to be ABOUT that stuff -- it uses Tyler Durden and his
nihilistic burpings as an excuse to show things that are by turns shocking,
funny, outrageous, repellent, stupid, and then finally just tiresome.  By
the time we get to the "about" part, the movie's already betrayed itself,
and smirks at us with its trick third act that doesn't even really explain
anything.  What's worse, a movie that deals ineptly with a good subject, or
one which uses flashy plot mechanisms to tapdance around really dealing with
it at all?
The problem isn't with David ("Seven") Fincher's extraordinary direction or
the above-average performances by the cast.  Let's face it, there are good
people at work here: Norton's splendid; Pitt is funny when not being jerked
around by the plot; Carter is unexpectedly brassy and scene-stealing.  Her
weirdo monologues could have been torn out and used as the centerpiece for
another, better movie all by themselves.
I wanted to like "Fight Club", or at least appreciate its sardonic flashes
of wit, but I could not.  It's a cold, crass joke at the expense of its
audience; a two-and-a-half-hour red herring that winds up being nothing at
all by pretending to be about a lot of things it doesn't really understand.

It may take a second viewing to see if `Fight Club' makes any
sense at all, but first-time writer Jim Uhls (adapting Chuck
Palahniuk's novel) has fashioned a sardonic, darkly funny script,
and David Fincher keeps the film involving at every turn.
Another reason why `Fight Club' works so well is the forceful
performance of Edward Norton. He first caught the public's eye as a
schizophrenic choirboy in `Primal Fear', and garnered his second
Oscar nomination last year for the powerful `American History
X'. Norton can carry a film with the best of them, and `Fight
Club' might just make him a star.
Brad Pitt is charismatic in as Tyler, showing that he belongs in
Fincher's films (he starred in `Seven') rather than in
melodramatic trash like `Seven Years In Tibet' and `Meet Joe
Black'. Helena (`Wings Of The Dove') Bonham Carter's
faux-American accent wasn't believable, but the choice to cast her
was an interesting one.
The opinions on `Fight Club' will differ from person to person,
but my conclusion is that the film is an unsettling, freakish
experience, but it will reward those who choose to accept it. It'll
be interesting to watch `Fight Club' in 30 years and see how it
stands the test of time, because it brings up issues that may be
important sooner than we think. To quote the tagline for this
year's `Minus Man', `conversation usually follows.'

Directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game, Alien 3). Starring Edward Norton
and Brad Pitt. Just by looking at these three names, I knew that this was
going to be a absolute great movie. And it was.
The movie is all about Joe, or the Narrator, or whatever his name is. Joe
(Edward Norton) is a typical character from a Douglas Coupland novel. Thirty
years old, living on his own in his IKEA furnished luxurious apartement, and
is having a well-payed white-collar job at a car manufacturer. Picture
perfect for any Generation X. But he has insomnia and hasn't slept in 6
months. Just like a Coupland character! So this Joe is out to seek a cure
for his insomnia. He found it by visiting group-sessions who are talking
about their illness and phobia and other stuff. Here Joe finds all the
compasion he needs, so he can sleep.
But after a while, a Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) came to these sessions,
and Joe found out that she's just like Joe, not having a certain illness or
phobia. This drives Joe crazy, so he goes back again to the insomnia-days.
While in his insomnia days, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an
airplane. The two talked, and after Joe's apartment blew sky-high, he stayed
at Tyler's place. Both in search for a meaning of life, and soon they were
starting this club, The Fight Club.
Even though the first two rules of The Fight Club are "You never talk about
The Fight Club", The Fight Club spreads across the nation so fast. And then
everything goes so fast, suddenly you'll see that The Fight Club has turned
into a revolution movement, because Tyler Durden said "The things you own
end up owning you."
The ending is amazing. You can choose whatever you like, because Fincher has
put it in a certain way so you can figure out the film as you like.
All and all, I think that this is the best movie since Pulp Fiction. It's
kinda like an answer for people asking what and who this Generation X are,
and what is really on their mind. And a lot of fighting with minimalized gun
shots (only 2 or 3 shots).

Yeah, there's spoilers... Stay back.
I have to admit, I have mixed feelings on this one.
First off, I have to admire the filmmakers for getting such a genuinely
subversive movie without even seriously undercutting their own subversion.
That almost never happens in Hollywood films... or, at least, in movies
with a subversive text, the occasional subversive subtext slips by, but
that's a story for another day.
Secondly, the film is very well done. It's an entertaining, hilarious
two and a half hour trip. The acting is dead on.  The pace is quick and
sharp. The score moved the story along and kept the mood.
So, what could possibly be my problem?
My problem is the film never made up its mind on a position. It
presented two very extreme positions, for purpose of satire, so in
clearly judging the one - the yuppie lifestyle - it should by process of
elimination pick the other - violent revolution. But instead of
advocating that position forcefully, it tries instead to look
unjudgingly atthat position without showing any middle ground positions.
Not that the middle ground positions should have won out, as that would
clearly have undercut the films subversion. However in not presenting
them, when they should seem reasonably obvious to the average person, it
can't agrue against them. This leaves its argument wanting.
It also spends a great deal of time exploring the beauty of the "Fight
Club" in its original form of basement groups of guys fistfighting. I
understood how they were living then rather than merely existing as they
had before.  The film very effectively conveyed that sense of
reinvigorated male passion... and raised my testosterone levels and I
was there with the film, baby...
.... but then it never addresses how becoming a uniform Brown Shirt in
Tyler's little army is anything like living. It seems like the same kind
of half-existance in slavery that they were supposedly trying to get
away from. A point that it, again, seemed remarkably unaware of. It
tried to draw attention away from that by making the narrator's point of
view be against the destruction and death and arguing both sides of
that.
I know people are going to call these things the delightful and thought
provoking ambiguities of the film, but I think they are actually glaring
examples of not thinking the whole thing through.
Most of all, I'm disappointed that when someone finally manages a chance
to make a film this subversive, it didn't make its argument better.

Wow. Director David Fincher has now made three extremely original and
powerful films in a row. He created SEVEN (9/10), the best thriller of the
nineties, THE GAME (8/10), an excellent film featuring a labyrinthian script
with plenty of twists and turns, and now, FIGHT CLUB, a man's movie which
accentuates the director's uniquely creative touch alongside an impeccably
written script sure to elicit plenty of insight and discussion. All in all,
I would say that the man is having a great decade!
PLOT:
A young, disheartened male hooks up with another cool rockin' young male who
likes to live life to its rawest, and the two men start up a local "fight
club", which no one (including this critic) can talk about. When the high of
the fights are no longer enough to satisfy the duo, they decide to take
things to another level.
CRITIQUE:
Every now and then, a film comes along with balls big enough to pull you by
the hair, bang you against the wall and order you to "wake the fuck up!" and
question your entire purpose of life. AMERICAN BEAUTY was a variance of that
type of film, primarily targeted to the baby-boom family audience. FIGHT
CLUB is the fantasy answer to many of the questions facing the doomed male
"generation Xers" of the nineties. When contemplating your reality is a
task too depressing to reflect upon, why not invent your own tangible
existence and allow it to replenish your lost spirit and sense of direction?
This film gave me a strong sense of power, a visceral energy, opening my
eyes to aspects of my life which had previously laid dormant. I understood
Norton's character. He spoke to me. He understood me. He understood a lot of
my buddies. We understood him. This film is NOT for everyone. It's quite
long at close to two and a half hours, it's deeper than the commercials make
it out to be, and it's definitely going to be appreciated on certain levels
more by men than women. And that ain't sexist, that's just like I think
THELMA & LOUISE is a great movie, but some women considered it to be their
wake-up call. FIGHT CLUB would be ours.
Most importantly, besides all of the philosophical poignancies of this film,
is the fact that the movie entertained me thoroughly. It had a Fincher-feel
(We could say that now), many unique ways of presenting the film's
developments, a dark, brooding look, excellent portrayals by all of the
actors involved, a pounding soundtrack, which I wish they had utilized to a
stronger degree, black humor (!), and a conclusion which can only make you
want to see the film all over again. Toss all that in with plenty of LOST
HIGHWAY-type touches, homosexual undertones, and oh yes...a hot, steaming
plate of the ol' ultra-violence!! Unlike some people, I do not think any of
the violence in this film was overdone, in fact, once you understand the
message of the film, you should truly be able to appreciate its precise
raison-d'etre. It's not even about the fight clubs themselves (Nuff said)!
Another thing I loved about this film is its trailer, which thankfully gave
us very little about the plot, and left so much more to the imagination.
Excellent appetizer! Another sign of a great film is when it has me
chattering it up with my buddies afterwards. FIGHT CLUB kept us yapping for
hours on end. Figuring this thing out, then another thing, and yet another.
Very cool!
One piece of advice that I will hand over to people who have yet to see this
film is that you should go in with a completely open mind. It is very
important for you, much like the main character in this film, to flush all
of your preconceptions and expectations of a film. See it as a painting and
study its texture while discovering its many sorted hidden messages. Or
better yet...see it so that you could check out Brad Pitt's crazy six-pack
abs!! Wow, what a man and whatta movie! See it or I'll have to fight you in
the parking lot after work!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Seeing that comparisons to the Kubrick classic CLOCKWORK ORANGE seemed
inevitable (Fellow online movie critic James Berardinelli called it "the 90s
version of CLOCKWORK ORANGE), it's nice to see that the screenwriter also
saw the connection as he included the word "clockwork" in one of Norton's
dialogue pieces. Listen for it during the last half hour of the film.
Another "in-joke" in this movie has Pitt and Norton walking out onto a
sidewalk which features a movie theatre in the background. The marquee on
the theatre reads SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET, Brad Pitt's 1997  unsuccessful film.
Helena Bonham Carter's character of Marla was the last role to be cast by
director David Fincher who reportedly chose the Oscar-nominated star over
Rosanna Arquette, Courtney Love, and Winona Ryder. Originally, the title
role of Tyler Durden was open to Sean Penn as well.
I don't think that I'm the only one who caught these, but during the first
half hour of the movie, I noticed several "subliminal" Tyler Durden
appearances pop up in scenes in which he was not a part. Think about it.
In order to look the thuggish part, Brad Pitt had a dentist chisel out
notches in his front teeth.
The 8 Rules of Fight Club are: 1) You do not talk about Fight Club 2) You do
not talk about Fight Club 3) When someone says "Stop" or goes limp, the
fight is over 4) Only two guys to a fight 5) One fight at a time 6) No
shirts, no shoes 7) Fights go on as long as they have to 8) If this is your
first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.
According to his publisher, novelist Chuck Palahniuk (pronounced
paul-ah-nik) is a thirty-four-year-old Caucasian male, five-foot-eleven, one
hundred ninety pounds, brown, green. Of French and Russian descent, he is
attributed to Carol and Fred Palahniuk. He has no distinguishing marks, and
was a technical writer churning out manuals on trucks, service and cars
before he hit it big with his first novel entitled "Fight Club". Fight Club
inspirations? "I did some volunteer work in a hospice for the terminally ill
a couple of years ago and that's where a lot of the stuff in the book came
from. I really loved how people who were really facing it - facing death -
could be really honest and funny and I found that really inspiring to be
around. Furthermore, many of the things that happen in Fight Club are actual
things that have happened to people I know. It's funny, friends who have
recognized themselves in the book come up to me and are really flattered
that I remembered them at a party two days ago. People recognize their cars,
houses and their story and they're so thrilled to have read it in a book."

At one point in "Fight Club," Edward Norton and Brad Pitt study a
designer underwear ad posted on the wall of a bus. After looking at
images of a lean, incredibly well defined male body, Norton asks "Is
that what a man looks like?" and the pair break into derisive
laughter. In another segment, Pitt lectures a group of men, stating
they were betrayed by a television culture that told each boy he was
destined to be a rich, celebrated rock star or movie star. The irony,
of course, is that Norton and Pitt are both rich, celebrated movie
stars with bodies that closely resemble those in the underwear ad. The
beauty of "Fight Club" is that its creators are completely aware of
the irony.
Dark, brutal and very funny, "Fight Club," the latest from David
Fincher ("Alien3," "Seven" and "The Game"), is one of the most
mesmerizing films to come along in quite a while. This ingenious
package combines dazzling visuals, a sizzling score, top-notch acting
and a truly audacious screenplay to whack the audience upside the
head, challenging us to sort out the dense conceptual package. At once
a psychological study, an apocalyptic horror show and a feature length
bloody giggle, "Fight Club" shouts "Fire!" in a crowded theater,
knowing that most of us will stay and study the flames instead of
running to safety.
The film begins, literally, inside the mind of its unnamed narrator
(Edward Norton), as the camera swoops through his brain, out of his
head and up the barrel of the gun in his mouth. Then we jump backwards
in time to learn what led to this moment. Frazzled by insomnia, the
narrator begs a doctor for medication to help him sleep. Instead, the
physician snaps at his patient, suggesting he visit a weekly
testicular cancer victims' group to "see what real suffering is like."
At the meeting, the narrator finds himself sobbing in the arms of
"fellow" sufferers, providing the catharsis he needs to sleep. He
quickly becomes a support group addict, attending different meetings
daily under a variety of assumed names.
All is well until he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter),
another poseur who travels the support group circuit because it's
"cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.'' The narrator cannot
cry with another "tourist" in the room and his insomnia soon returns.
Then, during a plane flight, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a
self-assured provocateur who works two part-time jobs when not
peddling his home-made soap to upscale stores. As a projectionist, he
splices single pornographic frames into family films. As a waiter, he
"seasons" foods with his bodily fluids. Tyler and the narrator bond
during a night of drinking, sealing their newfound friendship with a
just-for-the-hell-of-it fistfight. High off the violent release, they
decide to fight on a weekly basis. Other men witness the sparring and,
in short order, Fight Club is born, an underground phenomena that
spreads like wildfire.
Tyler becomes the central figure of the new men's movement, spouting
bumper sticker philosophy to his rapt audience of lost boys desperate
to remove the numbness from their ordered lives. Tyler begins
assigning homework ("Pick a fight with a stranger. Lose the fight")
and Fight Club escalates into Project Mayhem, something far more
frightening. The narrator is shaken by the changes. Why is Tyler
getting all the credit for something they both created? Why is Marla
sleeping with Tyler? And why didn't Tyler tell him about Project
Mayhem?
The extremely violent madness spins wildly, with kinetic camerawork
and the Dust Brothers' score creating a surreal atmosphere of
impending doom. The cast is outstanding, with the three principal
actors doing flawless work and Meat Loaf Aday contributing a solid
supporting turn. Jim Uhls' screenplay, based on the novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, contains so many ideas that it is impossible for Fincher to
address them all, so the director simply presents them for our
consideration. While sifting through the barrage, certain things
linger, from the early, almost subliminal single-frame flashes of
Tyler to the overwhelming homoerotic imagery in the bastions of
hyper-machismo. Of course, Tyler's psychobabble is merely a
rationalization for stylish violence (evoking memories of "A Clockwork
Orange"), but what does Fincher really think about the subject?
The moral conclusions are left up to us. In interviews, Fincher merely
stresses that the film is primarily a comedy. And it is: a grand,
horrific comedy that actually provokes discussion and reflection.
In light of a major revelation that comes late in the film, you'll
likely go see "Fight Club" again. I did, and the story is even more
fascinating the second time around. But as I left the theater, yet
another question popped into my head that will send me back to study
"Fight Club" a third time. SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING MAY REVEAL A
SIGNIFICANT PLOT POINT. After you learn the secret, ask yourself "Is
Marla Real?" Chew on that one for awhile.

Christian Critic's Movie Parables - http://www.christiancritic.com
DIRECTED BY:      David Fincher
STARRING:         Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat
Loaf, Jared Leto
WRITTEN BY:       Jim Uhls
RATED:            R for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent
anti-social behavior, sexuality and language.
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       James 4:1-3, Ephesians 6:12, Proverbs 4:14-19
Just two weeks ago, I reviewed a movie in which sixteen different kinds
of devil spirits could be identified as influencing the actions of the on
screen characters.  Of course, there are more than just those sixteen
classifications.  Now I understand why the one film only used the sixteen.
The others were needed on the set of FIGHT CLUB, a disturbing and twisted
cinematic roller coaster of a ride.
David Fincher (SEVEN) does not flinch or shy away from depicting a
nihilistic view of society.  Instead he embraces the challenge of making
two self-destructive characters his likable leads.  He paints the bleak
and darkly comedic picture with the skill and adeptness of a genuine
auteur.  The film is original, inventive, and spiritually nauseating all
at the same time.
Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X) narrates the film for us as Jack, an
insomniac so disillusioned and disenfranchised with life that he regularly
visits different support groups in order to experience some kind of
cathartic release which enables him to sleep.  Testicular Cancer,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Brain Tumors R Us... it doesn't matter, although it
would appear that the more painful the affliction, the greater the
emotional release.  Ergo, the sweeter the sleep.
His need for this perverse charade is eliminated once he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt, MEET JOE BLACK).  In hindsight, his continuing the
pretense of having testicular cancer would have been a lot saner than
following the direction of this charasmatic, unconventional, soap
salesman.   Together, Tyler and Jack discover the therapuetic benefits of
beating the living daylights out of another human being (or conversely,
being knocked senseless by another person).
Dubbing their new organization "Fight Club," they begin attracting other
followers who, like them, want to fight another person in order to feel
the adrenaline rush through their bodies, even as their blood is pouring
out.  Only then do they truly feel "alive."
This perverse type of logic runs throughout the film.  More and more
"members" are recruited, joining what has become a "don't ask, don't tell,
don't think" army.  Having two men pummel one another is no longer
sufficient for Tyler's demented psyche, so plans for "Operation Mayhem"
are put into action.  Fight Club takes on the shape of an underground
terrorist organization with their aggression turning outward, targeting
the societal ills Tyler deems "responsible" for the desperate plight of
mankind.
Jack watches the evolution of the Fight Club he helped to found, feeling
a bit left out as the club takes on a life of its own, moving inexorably
to an end he cannot control.
The acting is superb, both Mr. Pitt and Mr. Norton demonstrating their
consummate talents in difficult and complex roles.  Helena Bonham Carter
(THE THEORY OF FLIGHT) is very much their acting equal as a tough but
troubled girl who inserts herself into Jack's life and home, first by
invading his support groups and later by engaging in a violently sexual
relationship with Tyler.  Meat Loaf (CRAZY IN ALABAMA) and Jared Leto
(URBAN LEGEND) also provide strong support as two very different Fight
Club members.
As artistically fascinating as the movie may be, the spiritual sickness
that it depicts is, at the very least, distasteful.  While I have given
the movie high praise for its artistic elements and director's vision, the
lack of a star rating indicates my strongest caution.  This is a movie
that depicts characters with no spiritual insight and therefore no defense
against devilish logic, influence or possession.  The "glitzy" style and
the boisterous performances may make it palatable for today's audiences,
but when stripped down to its ugly essence, the negative anti-social
messages at its core give nihilists worldwide something for which to cheer.
At one point, the no-named, dehumanized members of Tyler's army learn
that upon dying, one becomes "human" and finally worthy of being called by
a proper name.  This sick message is something the author of death would
dearly love to promote.

On one side of the fight ring, we have a motion picture that is a visual 
masterpiece, one that knows exactly what it wants to do, and how it wants to 
look. As a study in style and camera artistry, it is as impressive and 
dizzyingly original as any other film of 1999. On the other side of the fight 
ring, we have a motion picture that runs out of worthwhile material at the 
one-hour mark, becoming repetitive, repugnant, and dull. Its message, about 
living your life the way you want to before the tedious nature of life takes 
over your soul, is severely muddled amid the grisly onslaught of violence, 
and was not only covered far more effectively in "American Beauty," but 
treated its characters with respect, rather than as a joke. Worse yet, the 
final thirty minutes brings a twist that is unpredictable, to be sure, but 
also genuine rubbish. Director David Fincher (whose 1995 psychological 
thriller, "Se7en," is his only successful venture, to date) clearly gets a 
lot of pleasure out of jerking his audiences around, and has come up with a 
sharp plot turn that is as superficial and plainly silly as probably anything 
I've seen since Fincher's very own, "The Game," in 1997. The more you stop to 
think about it, in fact, the less it makes sense, and not at all in the 
playful way David Lynch's best films delight, such as 1986's "Blue Velvet" 
and 1997's "Lost Highway."
Edward Norton stars as a bored office worker with no name, other than the 
Narrator. An insomniac who lives by himself in an apartment filled to 
bursting with consumer furniture and appliances, he starts to spend his 
evenings going to self-help groups for everything from testicular cancer to 
tuberculosis because he finds becoming a person other than himself each night 
adds comfort to his life. As he attends them more and more, he discovers that 
someone else has been doing the same thing as him. Her name is Marla Singer 
(Helena Bonham Carter), a darkly-dressed, hilariously extreme chain-smoker, 
and after he confronts her about it, they decide to work out a schedule so 
that they don't go to the same meetings. On a plane back home after a 
business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), an "oh-so-cool," 
confident, possibly dangerous, thirtysomething who isn't afraid of anything 
or anyone. When his apartment ends up being destroyed in a fire, the Narrator 
shacks up with Tyler at his grimy pad, and they immediately form a sort of 
secret organization called Fight Club, in which a group of men meet each 
night and beat each other to a bloody pulp, in response to the 
dissatisfaction of their pathetic, working-class lives. The club surprisingly 
grows larger and larger with each night, until the Narrator suspects it may 
be getting out of control after Tyler throws acid on his hand one night and 
forces him to keep it there until it has burnt right through his skin. 
Meanwhile, Tyler and Marla have met up and begun a strictly sexual 
relationship.
"Fight Club" is a convoluted, blackly-comic thriller that director Fincher 
has said takes an anti-violence stance, despite its nearly non-stop barrage 
of fights, guns, and blood, and so my question to him is: "What exactly is 
anti-volent about it?" As far as this film's characters are concerned, 
fighting is an especially enjoyable way to spend an evening, and despite a 
few human casualties throughout, Fincher takes no stance on the subject of 
violence, nor does he responsibly handle it. Norton's character goes through 
few changes throughout, aside from becoming more liberated, and is never 
attempted to be developed as an actual person who might actually live on 
Earth, nor is any effort made to make him the least bit likable or 
sympathetic. Since Fincher wastes his chances to give Norton a character arc, 
or to make some sort of point on violence (unlike Oliver Stone's profound 
1994 satire, "Natural Born Killers"), the only recognizable meaning to get 
out of the film is, like I've already mentioned, almost identical to that of 
"American Beauty," minus the underlying themes and three-dimensional 
characters. 
The first hour is spectacularly fascinating, as it draws you into the 
Narrator, his petty life, the self-help groups he meets with, Marla, and the 
early appearances of Tyler Durden. I questioned exactly where everything was 
going because, thus far, the film had intrigued and pulled me in like very 
few film do. That's when the Fight Club starts, and where the picture loses 
its footing and plausability. Merely the idea of an underground club that 
gets its kicks out of hurting others and getting hurt is difficult to 
swallow, because the way that the masochistic group grows so quickly is 
ludicrous. Are there really people in the world who would indulge in a Fight 
Club? Yes, probably so. But it's foolish to believe that so many men would be 
pulled into it so quickly, and actually like doing it. Sorry, I just don't 
buy it.
In a role that requires massive frenticism and energy, Edward Norton is more 
than acceptable to bring the Narrator's personality to life, but has very 
little to do on a character level. Brad Pitt, in his most assured performance 
since 1995's "12 Monkeys," nonetheless remains an enigma, and although this 
is appropriate under the cirmcumstances, I question the reasons for his 
attraction to the thin role. If anyone escapes relatively unscathed, it is 
Helena Bonham Carter, in one of the most memorable supporting performances of 
the year. Her portrayal of Marla is one-of-a-kind, and very few people could 
have pulled it off with such fearless bravado and genuine comic sensibilites. 
In supporting turns, Meat Loaf Aday, as Bob, a man struck with testicular 
cancer whose estrogen level has gone up, forcing him to grow breasts, is 
treated as nothing but a joke, rather than a real person. This is 
unfortunate, considering that Aday gives an otherwise moving performance. The 
big mystery in the actor department is Jared Leto, who is so wasted as one of 
Fight Club's members, I suspect his part was criminally edited down to what 
is now more or a less a cameo.
By the film's last half-hour, I had simply stopped caring. The twist is 
admittedly surprising, but also preposterous. Director Fincher and 
screenwriter Jim-Uhls may believe that they have made something clever and 
slick, a film for the late-'90s generation, but it comes off purely as a 
gimmick, and a frustrating one at that. The final image of "Fight Club" is 
unforgettable and oddly beautiful, but only in the context of the scene 
itself, rather than the film as a whole. And there lies the problem with the 
movie--taking every scene on an individual basis, it is often madly 
brilliant, but put it all together, and it is a pretentious, incoherent mess.

     On the heels of AMERICAN BEAUTY, one dark satire of American
suburban life, comes a far grimmer satire of lower class society and
anger.  Chuck Palahniuk's premier novel is brought to the screen as a
howl of rage by David Fincher, director of ALIEN 3, SE7EN, THE GAME,
and the upcoming RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. FIGHT CLUB is about a subculture
of men who have turned their backs on soft supportive philosophies and
meaningless consumerism and have replaced it with hard knuckles and
covert terrorism.
     As the film opens, the narrator of the film (Edward Norton) has
someone unseen holding a gun in his mouth.  He begins to think back
over the previous six months to how he came to this pass.  In flashback
he has been a man suffering from insomnia, living in a constant
netherworld between awake and asleep.  He complains of the malady to
his doctor.  His doctor belittles him and suggests that if he wants to
see what real pain is he should visit a testicular cancer support
group.  Under an assumed name, the narrator pretends to be a fellow
sufferer and soon finds he really enjoys going to and giving support to
the patients.  He begins going every night a week to a different
disease encounter group.  Then he notices Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter) who shares this voyeuristic hobby.  They begin to barter which
support groups each may cover. In a different setting, he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt) a soap salesman and film projectionist who is
fighting his own war guerilla against society.
     When a mysterious explosion destroys the narrator's apartment, he
arranges an invitation to stay with Durden who asks for one thing in
return.  He wants to fight the narrator.  The narrator surprises
himself by enjoying the experience. This becomes a frequent habit
replacing encounter groups.  As other men come to watch the two fight,
they want to fight also, forming a common bond.  Durden and the main
character found a secret society that stages fist fights.  Eschewing
the old life of soft self-sacrificing support of others, membership in
the macho fighting society starts changing all of the narrator's
perspectives.  All that is real is the world where men fight
emasculation and prove their strength by the friendly beating of each
other.  They then wear their injuries as proof they are manly.
Eventually this underground counterculture will add to its agenda the
sowing of chaos and anarchy.
     Jim Uhls's script is frequently bitterly funny, but fails to
connect the various themes together.  The catalog-buying consumer
culture seems so little to touch the lifestyle of Tyler Durden that his
rage against it seems unmotivated and almost could have been added by
the writers as an afterthought.  Even if Durden is to use it as a
symbol of what he is fighting the film needs to tell us why that symbol
of superficiality rather than, say, architecture or vacation homes. The
text chillingly examines the bestial impulses in man and suggests that
we are a long way from breeding them out of the species.  The main
character is saddled with opposite impulses "to comfort the afflicted
and to afflict the comfortable."  In theme and even somewhat in plot
this film could be compared to, of all things, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.
JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.
     Jeff Cronenweth's photography features an agile and dizzying
camera flying the viewer around and through holes where Orson Wells
would fear to go.  Virtually every scene in the movie is underlit to
reflect the theme and create a repressive tone.
     This film seems a not entirely directed howl of anger.  It is
technically flawed, but coming in the wake of rage crimes like
Littleton it could not be more timely.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Formed correctly, the punch is the perfect exercise.  With the fist clenched
tight, tucked palm up into the armpit, half of the body can be worked.  As the
arm spins itself to meet the opponent with the knuckles each muscle of the arm
exerts nearly equal force.  The proper spin takes the weight of one half of
the body behind it, from the toes to the tongue (which swings in your mouth by
its own accord yet is always in concert with the movement of the rest of your
body), exerting the same amount of force on every fiber of your being.  This
same exercise, able to expend so much energy in a single action, can also
serve numerous psychological functions.  The most popular of these functions
is the release of penned up male hostility.
        Deprived of the "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" like
phrasing, this is the message and purpose behind Fight Club.  It is an
organization designed to free the male element of society by allowing them to
release their aggressions in a way that is designed to be relatively
harmless.
The two men behind Fight Club are Jack (Edward Norton), a yuppie insomniac
who has become addicted to self-help groups, and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a
man who makes soap and spouts modern day mantras to the common man as well as
works two night jobs.  Jack has spent a year crying his eyes out at support
groups for ailments he doesn't have, a solace shattered by the arrival of
Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who goes to the support groups "because
they're cheaper than movies and they have free coffee."  Shortly after this
solace is shattered, his condominium is blown up.  Left without a place to
stay, he has a choice: stay with the woman that "were [he] to have a tumor,
its name would be Marla," or stay with Tyler, a single-serving friend (he met
Tyler on an airplane).
Fight Club starts innocently enough.  Tyler and Jack are out in a parking lot
and both experience the first fist fight of their lives.  They do this every
Sunday, their own Sabbath from the pressures of the designer-clothes world. 
After a few weeks, it begins to grow.  Two becomes four.  Four becomes eight. 
Eight becomes sixteen.
When Flight Club hits a certain point, it switches from a recreational
activity to a way of life.  It is the freedom from the repression of society,
and Tyler Durden has become the leader of a terrorist group.  The group is
dedicated, autonomous, and fanatical to its head.
The most amazing thing about Fight Club is that, as you watch the entire
movie unfold in front of your eyes, the rhetoric that Tyler Durden spouts
makes a bizarre sort of sense.  You don't know whether to laugh or to cry at
the pity of the world Fincher creates or whether to start a local chapter.
Fincher, fresh off of the ultra-paranoid The Game, paints a noirish
psychological terror in our minds while making us laugh at the same time.  You
can picture him at the Avid machine, editing away with a sardonic smile on his
face and a cigarette in between his lips.  He proves himself yet again to be
one of the finest directors of thrillers working today.
Brad Pitt goes back to his highly eccentric roots that he honed so well in 12
Monkeys. Edward Norton proves up to the challenge of a role like one he has
never done before and handles it perfectly.  In him, we see a bleak new
portrait of America's urban Everyman, feeling betrayed by a society that he is
at the dregs of.  However, the true crowning achievement acting-wise of the
film is Helena Bonham Carter, who is actually British yet flawlessly takes on
an American role body language and all.  Marla, perhaps the most-well
developed character, gets to have the most fun and it is clear that Carter
enjoys playing her.
Done properly, the punch is the perfect exercise.  Done as it is, Fight Club
is a nearly perfect way to spend two and a half hours.

`Fight Club' is the kind of breathless experience that chews you up,
spits you out, and leaves your senses jaded and disorientated with
exhilaration. It's a sublimely bizarre, starkly hilarious tale of an
underworld group of men who beat each other to a bloody pulp. But that's
certainly not the limit that director David Fincher and screenwriter Jim
Uhls have propelled the film to. The trailer would have you believe it's
merely a dark, disturbing guy movie.  Really, `Fight Club' tackles so
much more.
Fincher's astounding ascent begins right off the bat, when he takes us
through the barrel of a gun during the opening credits. The director has
showed incredible visual style in each of his previous efforts,
including his most recent, the labyrinthine puzzle thriller `The Game'.
Fincher has a knack for establishing mood and atmosphere, and in `Fight
Club', he breaks any and all barriers that could have previously
confined him. This is one wild and crazy ride; an adrenaline rush with
maniacal camera work that zips ferociously through the contents of a
trash basket, an apartment complex, and various other household
appliances.
This is the story of the socially-challenged Jack (Edward Norton), a
30-year old man suffocated by his job and badly suffering from a serious
bout of insomnia. Attending a self-help group for testicular cancer,
Jack is heartened at the fact that people feel sorry for him. He begins
appearing at these self-help groups on a frequent basis, until he spots
another `tourist': the ragged, chain-smoking drug kitten Marla (Helena
Bonham Carter). It just doesn't work any more for Jack. That is, until
he meets the glorified soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane
trip, and new possibilities are opened in his mind.
`Fight Club' is Jim Uhls' adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's acclaimed
novel of the same name. For the majority of it's lengthy 2 hour, 20
minute running time, Uhl's script has a delightful screw loose - one
that keeps the audience on edge as it twists and turns in several
unexpected directions. There are many details explored before Uhls
introduces the movie's central premise. During these moments, Tyler
introduces Jack to his method of personal liberation: old fashioned
hand-to-hand combat. After a while, this `fight club' begins to catch
on, and several new members are awaiting their turn to join in the
no-holds-barred face pummeling. There are only 8 simple rules. The first
rule: `You do not talk about fight club.' The second: `You DO NOT talk
about fight club.' Any questions so far?
At around the two-hour mark, just as `Fight Club' appears to have
exhausted every capably fresh idea in it's deranged little head, a
creative little plot twist comes into play. Is this twist at all logical
in any way? Certainly not. It's goofy but moderately resourceful, adding
fuel to a tired formula and ensuring enough palpable steam for an
appropriate finale. Some may compare this to the mind-bender of a climax
in `The Sixth Sense', but I beg to differ. Unlike that previous
late-summer smash, I was able to predict the unexpected `surprise' in
this entry (or at least detect a sign that things were not as they
seemed). Still, it's an interesting and strategic contortion of the
plot, and I admired the elaborate complexities of it all.
Around Oscar time next year, expect a nomination handed out to at least
one member of the lead ensemble in `Fight Club'. I vote for Norton, who
displays the perfect regulated amount of emotions, causing the narrator
Jack to aggressively appear as just a regular, average joe. But the
memorable centerpiece of the film is easily the offbeat, energized
character of Tyler Durden. Make a note: Brad Pitt has now shed his
pretty-boy image indefinitely, or, at least until he appears as a
typical pin-up hunk in his next film. Bonham Carter approaches the dazed
role of Marla with expertise, and there is also a modest supporting turn
from none other than Meat Loaf (who is credited as `Meat Loaf Aday').
The Loaf plays an overly obese man with gigantic breasts. Just thought
you'd like to know.
There is a graphic amount of violence in `Fight Club', but none seems
entirely inappropriate due to the nature of the subject matter. Fincher
corners the audience with darkly disturbing material, and the reaction
is - laughter? Yes indeed, and a healthy bit of it; the highlights
include a scene where Tyler and Jack smuggle several bags of human fat
from a liposuction clinic, with the intended purpose of using it as a
secret ingredient in the soap. If you think that sounds disgusting, wait
until you experience it in all it's fatty glory. Right from square one,
`Fight Club' is startling and darkly hilarious.
Of course, there is `inner meaning' hidden behind all the bloody
hi-jinks. For instance, why condemn yourself in the ugly barracks of an
average, everyday existence? Live freely, Tyler cautions. Few of these
moral messages successfully got through to me. But `Fight Club' delivers
a delectable helping of visual brilliance, original storytelling and
exhilarating action. This alone provides a prominent reason to see it.
So do it, before I get angry.

First rule of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight
Club. So, right away, I'm in trouble with this bleak, profoundly
disturbing, testosterone-laden contemporary study of emasculation and
insanity. Edward Norton is the nameless narrator. He's a bored,
bitter, yuppie insomniac with no family or close friends. For company,
he joins cancer and other disease-support groups, while Brad Pitt is
Tyler Durden, a devious, charismatic anarchist who challenges him,
taunting "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in
a fight?" He introduces Norton to the raw, animalistic instinct for
survival. When their bare-fist brawls outside a bar attract cheering
crowds, they create an underground network of secret, private clubs
where self-destructive, disillusioned professionals can seek solace
from despair by pummeling each other to smithereens. "This is your
life," Durden says, "and it's ending one day at a time."  Soon Durden
becomes a subversive cult hero, a grungy messiah for the
sado-masochists of an emotionally-dead generation suffering from the
onslaught of consumerism and technology. And Helena Bonham Carter is
the funny, foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, self-help junkie who comes
between the two men.  Adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls from Chuck
Palahniuk's gritty best-seller and directed by David Fincher
("Seven"), it's a fast-paced, stylized man's movie, exploring the
psychology of violence, complete with a sub-plot involving bath soap
made from human body fat from a liposuction clinic. Both Norton and
Pitt deliver knockout performances, relishing the wry, cruel nihilist
humor. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Fight Club" is an
insidious, cynical, savage 8.  But it's socially irresponsible and
repellent in its graphic depictions of extreme violence and brutality.

FIGHT CLUB (R).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: David Fincher
Stars: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, Zach 
Grenier, Thom Gossom jr, 
Jared Leto
Running time: 141 minutes.
        David Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, etc) makes dark edged, gritty
contemporary tales exploring the dark soul of man, and Fight Club is
no exception.  There is a bleak, nihilistic undertone to this cynical
and subversive movie, which espouses violence and aggression as a
solution to the systematic emasculation of men and their struggle to
find their role in society as we move into the next century.
        Edward Norton plays the anonymous hero and narrator of this
disturbing tale.  An insurance adjuster, he is disillusioned and bored
with his unfulfilling life, and feels he is slowly dying, one day at a
time.  He briefly finds solace and catharsis by attending a series of
self help groups, where he finds compassion and warmth.  These
meetings become something of an addiction, until the presence of Marla
(Helena Bonham Carter), also a serial attendee, proves to be
off-putting.
        Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a charismatic but anarchistic
soap salesman, whom he meets on a flight.  Durden befriends Norton and
initiates him into the fight club, a place where men can vent their
frustration, rage and humiliation by punching the living daylights out
of each other.  Eventually though the club seems to take on a life of
its own and develops into some sort of urban terrorist group with a
far more sinister agenda.  However as Norton races against time to
prevent a disaster he discovers more about his true nature than he is
prepared for.
        Based on Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel, Fight Club is a
challenging and visceral film that defies mainstream conventions and
pushes the cinematic envelope a little further.  Visually, this is a
stunning film, and Fincher certainly dazzles us with his cinematic
pyrotechnics here.  He fills the screen with a veritable montage of
images and ideas, and the film's somewhat chaotic, frantic structure
enriches its disturbing vision of modern society characterised by
disharmony and confusion.  Fincher doesn't pull his punches, and this
is one of the more brutal and violent films you'll see this year.
There is a sadistic edge to much of the confronting violence.
However, the film is also tempered with a bleak, very twisted sense of
humour.  There is also a subtle homo-erotic touch to the relationship
between Pitt and Norton, especially evident in the bruising scenes set
inside the fight club itself, which is full of sweating, semi-naked
men beating each other up.
        Somehow Fincher seems to get the best out of Pitt.  He gives
another cocky, brash, jerky and mannered, occasionally narcissistic
performance that lies somewhere between his misunderstood lunatic from
Twelve Monkeys and his seductive psychopath from kalifornia.  He gives
the complex character a dangerous but charismatic edge.  Norton, who
has proved himself one of the more consistently interesting actors
around, delivers another solid performance in a demanding role.  But,
at times, his sense of confusion at the dizzying events overtaking him
seems to be too real.  As the woman caught between Tyler and our hero,
Bonham Carter gives one of her more ambivalent but sexually
uninhibited performances.
        But somehow the film seems to run out of ideas towards the end
and, like Fincher's previous film The Game, limps to a vaguely
unsatisfactory conclusion.  Ultimately Fight Club seems like a triumph
of style over substance.  While the film is visually impressive and
provocative, many in the audience will be disturbed by its themes and
find it more frightening than inspiring.
