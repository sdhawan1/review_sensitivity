"Hallelujah" was the first film from a major studio
with an all-black cast.  Perhaps we should be
grateful that "Hallelujah" exists, rather than
resentful that racism prevented the production
of other films like it.  But at least we have
"Hallelujah", which is more dynamic, fascinating
and unique than most of the other musicals from
the early sound era.
Daniel Haynes stars as Zeke, who, along with his
large family, makes a marginal living as a cotton
picker.  Come harvest time, Zeke gets paid for his
crop, but he promptly loses it to a pair of
con artists (William Fontaine and femme fatale
Nina Mae McKinney).  His brother is also killed.
In his despair, Zeke is born again, and becomes
a spellbinding preacher.  But his family's new-found
success is again threatened by Zeke's maddening
passion for McKinney.
The soundtrack for "Hallelujah" is excellent.
The nightclub scenes have vintage jazz performances.
There are also spirituals, folk songs, and lullabies.
Haynes has a resonant bass voice, reminiscent of
Paul Robeson.  Essentially, "Hallelujah" was filmed
as a silent, with the soundtrack later dubbed in.
That, along with cultural reasons and amateur actors,
may account for the exaggerated performances.
Distribution of the film proved more problematic,
as some theatre owners had fears that 'too many'
blacks would see the film, alienating white audiences.
King Vidor, a successful Texas-born director with
a Hollywood career spanning five decades, also
produced "Hallelujah".  His efforts were rewarded
with an Oscar nomination for Best Director.
