"Les Enfants du Paradis" is a French film better known
in the United States by its English translation,
"Children of Paradise".  It is an outstanding film
with a great cast, script and story; thoughtfully
directed by Marcel Carne.
The plot has the proud, independent Garance (Arletty)
choosing between the male leads, all of whom want her.
Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) is a talented mime,
loved by Nathalie (Maria Casares).  Frederick (Pierre
Brasseur) is a gregarious actor. Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand)
is a playwright turned robber and murderer.  Louis Salou
plays a wealthy and proud aristocrat.  The relationships
between the main characters is complex, and evolves over
the film, which is about three hours in length.
It is hard to find fault with such an outstanding
film, but "Children of Paradise" has a few minor flaws.
The character of Garance is supposed to be gorgeous.
Arletty has the necessary poise for the role, but
she is actually less attractive than Casares.  Later,
we meet three playwrights who are insulted by Frederick.
Two of the authors speak in unison, completing the
sentences of the third author.  Obviously, these are
absurd characters, but they seem out of place in this
drama.
There are several plays within a play.  These are all
quite different in mood.  Frederick turns one turgid
drama into a satire, and later plays Othello as if
filled with hatred.  Baptiste's productions are allegorical.
His feelings of unrequited love, suicide and murder
end up depicted as elaborate onstage productions.
The filming of "Children of Paradise" was interrupted by
World War II, and only completed after France was liberated.
Many of the cast were members of the French resistance
against the Germans.
