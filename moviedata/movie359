Gary "Gel" Dove (Ray Winstone) lives in quiet complacency on the sunny
coast of southern Spain. To all appearances, he is a normal middle-aged guy
who opted for early retirement. When friends tell him that he is about to
have a visit from Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), fear strikes the hearts of all
in "Sexy Beast."
One thing that "Sexy Beast" definitely is, is an enigma. It is, as far as I
can tell, a one of a kind, dazzlingly colorful gangster film noir. Music
vid and commercial director Jonathan Glazer does make quite a splash (and
not just at the film's funny, offbeat rolling stone opening) with a
gangster film that is long on talk and brief, even terse, on caper.
Gal has done time for his gangland deeds and is now blissfully retired to a
villa on the Costa del Sol with his mutually adoring wife, Deedee (Amanda
Redman). Aside from a near miss by a huge, mysteriously rolling stone, life
on the sunny Spanish shoreline could not be better. Until he learns that he
is about to have a visit by the sinister Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), a blast
from his gangster past. Just when Gal had himself convinced that he was out
of the crime game for good, Logan arrives to drag him back in, whether he
wants to or not. Gal is convinced that if he tells Don to his face, "I'm
not gonna do it," all will be well. But, it won't and the violent,
unpredictable Logan will not take "no" for an answer.
This scenario, with snippets of the setup for the upcoming London caper
mixed in, takes up the first two-thirds of the film, and precedes the heist
itself with a violent confrontation with Don. Gal arrives in London, sans
Logan, and wholeheartedly does his bit to pull off the grand theft and take
attention away from the missing Don. Crime boss and mastermind of the
break-in into an ultra secure vault, Teddy Best (Ian McShane), smells a rat
in Gal and does not believe his underling's story on the whereabouts of
Logan. After the heist and a pointedly insulting payoff to Gal, the
ultra-sinister Teddy promises that he might pay a visit to Gal in Spain,
just to see how he's doing. Once in, never out.
Ray Winstone does a fine job as the troubled Gal. The retired criminal's
particular talent (though this is not made clear in one of the movie's
ambiguities) earned him a good enough living, but after being busted and
doing time, he lost his taste for crime, seeking the solitude of Spain to
spend his days with Deedee. Ray doesn't have the gonads to stand up to Don
and weakens under his violent colleague's constant badgering. Winstone ably
displays Gal's tumble into insecurity and fear.
Ben Kingsley earns point as a violent, uncontrollable monster, but his
character is one-note sinister and doesn't rise above his symbol of Ray's
past evils. More effective in being a full-fledged bad guy is Ian McShane.
His Teddy Best conveys a violent, unbridled power capable of snuffing out
life in the blink of the eye. In a much smaller role than Kingsley's, he
develops into a three-D person, though one you would not want to cross.
Amanda Redman's Deedee puts depth into Deedee, making her the obviously
strong member of the couple. The rest of the supporting cast is capable,
but are mainly there to flesh things out. James Fox appears, in little more
than a cameo, as Teddy's ex, in more ways than one.
There is a bigger film here and it's unfortunate that the makers saw to
keep it short and sweet. While "Sexy Beast" is fun in its psychedelic noir,
there should have been more to it. I never thought I would willingly say
that a film should be longer than it is, but that is what is needed here.
The caper sequence is handled so quickly and stylishly, with an underwater
break-in as the linchpin, I wanted to see more, particularly of Teddy Best.
There could have been a great ruthless bad guy performance if McShane had
more screen time.
The techs, from camera, by Ivan Bird, to sets and locales and costumes, are
of a mind with the color-saturated eye of helmer Glazer. Frequent surreal
scenes, with Gal's nightmares prominent, also lend to the noir nature of
this modern gangster parable. At first, I compared "Sexy Beast" to the
classic Brit gangster flick, "The Long Good Friday," but comparison falls
apart pretty quickly, and in the end, it feels more akin to "The Hit" with
a dollop of "The Godfather 3" thrown on top. I give it a B-.

Starring Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane,
Amanda Redman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer. Rated R.
Sexy Beast isn't nearly as interesting as it thinks it
is. It's fueled by lead performances that are far more
electrifying than the characters they embody. As heist
flicks go, this one is stunningly boring, as a
gangster film it's nonsensical and as a character
study it's far too shallow to be taken seriously. But
it is blessed with Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley, and
they just about redeem Jonathan Glazer's debut effort.
This is the kind of "quirky" British movie that gets
high marks with critics because it opens with a scene
of portly Gal (Ray Winstone), mumbling words like
"burning" and "scorching" while sunbathing in a
Speedo. He's a retired criminal who dreads the arrival
of Don Logan, an Ã¼ber-gangster who will try to reel
him in for One Last Heist. His family, none of them
strangers to the criminal underworld, worry that Gal
will be convinced and leave his tranquil life in a
Spanish villa to risk going to jail.
Don Logan arrives in the form of the terrifying Ben
Kingsley. Yes, the Ben Kingsley who embodied Ghandi
and the mild-mannered Jewish accountant in Schindler's
List. He doesn't take "no" for an answer. Actually, he
doesn't take "no" for anything and completely ignores
Gal's repeated, if rather timid, denials, which
invariably begin with "I'm flattered that you'd think
of me, but..."
The interplay between Kingsley and Winstone is easily
the best thing about this hit-and-miss affair. Their
rapid-fire dialogue can be difficult to understand,
since the British dialect they speak comes from a part
of London that tourists never go, but I had no trouble
keeping up with the general gist of their
conversations, which are often wickedly funny. Still,
there is no insight contained in the back-and-forth;
no Tarantino-like layering and depth. It's
entertaining to watch, yes, but nothing more.
This would be okay, but the movie takes a wrong turn
after act two, which ends with the dismissal of one of
the main characters and proceeds to stage what may be
the least interesting movie heist in history. There's
a fundamental error in logic here; since everything
that preceded it focuses on whether or not the heist
would take place, there is absolutely no reason for us
to care about its outcome. It takes place. Great. It's
not the appropriate payoff for Glazer's markedly
different set-up.
Ben Kingsley is awesome, yes, and it's almost a
certainty that he will get an Oscar nod come February.
Winstone also does a great job with his underwritten
role. But we have no emotional investment in their
characters or the plot, and it doesn't feel like
Glazer does either. This isn't a mindless Hollywood
cash cow, but there is no impression that it's a labor
of love. Of course, the worst movies can sometimes
have truly dedicated filmmakers behind them
(Battlefield Earth is already a cliche of an example).
I don't know what the big deal is about this. The
general sentiment towards Sexy Beast seems to be a
close equivalent of "where have you been all my life?"
but I don't think it's remotely a great movie. I
wasn't bored, but I didn't care. 
"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts."
(Daniel Patrick Moynihan)

Ah, it's the good life.  Retired from the daily grind of making a living as a
British gangster, Gary "Gal" Dove (Ray Winstone), accompanied by his wife DeeDee
(Amanda Redman), lives in a remote Spanish villa.  With their fellow British
friends, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White), they are retired and
comfortable.
One day, into this life of contentment comes an unwelcome reminder of Gal's
past, a scary hood whose mere name, Don Logan, causes everyone to freeze.  With
a bald head, big ears and a menacing goatee, Ben Kingsley, in another of his
bravado performances, plays Don.  Like Gandhi's evil twin, Don uses silence and
laser-like glares to frighten the wits out of anyone who dares to cross his
path.  
SEXY BEAST, directed by Jonathan Glazer and written by Louis Mellis and  David
Scinto, has the intensity and the staccato dialog of a David Mamet film.  Don is
there to make Gal an offer that he can't refuse, literally.  Don needs Gal's
help on one more job.  Gal makes up his mind to turn down the offer, but he
explains to DeeDee that Don is not someone who allows disagreements.  Although
normally possessing a demeanor that's roughly the equivalent to the calm of the
eye in the center of a hurricane, Don can be riled.  In his most explosive
scene, Kingsley starts shouting, "No, no, no, ..."  with machine gun cadence and
force.
The melancholy music suggests that all is not going to go well.  And Gal's close
escape from a freak, killer boulder is an unmistakable omen.  The story's real
questions are how Don will convince Gal to do his bidding and who might end up
dead in the process.  Although there are a few nice twists along the way, this
is a crime drama that uses the force of the characters, not cheap plot tricks,
to maintain the tension.  Only those who require non-stop action will leave
disappointed.
SEXY BEAST runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for pervasive language, strong
violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.
The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, is it currently showing at the Camera Cinemas and the Century
theaters.

    CAPSULE: Gal is a 50s-ish London cockney gangster who has 
    retired to Spain.  His old associates want him for one last 
    job and send the vicious Don to give him an offer he can't 
    refuse.  A standout performance by Ben Kingsley as Don cannot 
    save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old 
    Westerns.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)
Roger Ebert asks in his review OF SEXY BEAST, "Who would have 
guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent 
movies would be played by...  Ben Kingsley?"  My response would be 
that anyone who has seen Alan Arkin in WAIT UNTIL DARK, Henry 
Fonda in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, or Anthony Hopkins in THE 
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS should have guessed it.  They should know 
that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is 
cast someone who generally plays mild, sympathetic, or even 
ineffectual character roles.  The same characteristics that make 
an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor 
when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious.  That is the 
principle that works for Kingsley in SEXY BEAST.
Gary "Gal" Dove (played by Ray Winstone) has retired from a London 
career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in Spain.  Life 
has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing.  But his 
paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch.  The first 
punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the 
villa.  The second punch comes from Gal's past.  Back in London 
gang boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane, TV's Lovejoy) is planning to 
break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants Gal.  He 
sends his most rabid henchman Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) to fetch 
Gal.  Don will accept any decision Gal makes from "yes" to 
"certainly."  However, if Gal says "no" Don will do whatever it 
takes to turn it into a yes including threatening Guy's ex-porn-
star wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman).  In the meantime Don knows just 
how to get under everybody's skin.  Kingsley makes Don a compact 
package of fury and nastiness.
There are some serious problems in Louis Mellis's and David 
Scinto's script that should have been caught before filming.  When 
we see the actual crime we have no idea why Gal was so important 
to its success.  Beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear, no 
special talents are required of him.  Any local hood could have 
done what Gal is needed for.  Additionally the crime involves 
digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault, flooding the 
vault.  No only could they have let the water out of the pool and 
avoided the complication altogether, but there is by far too much 
water to be accounted for by what was in the pool.
In spite of the provocative title, the story is cliched and overly 
familiar.  I know I have seen all the plot elements of SEXY BEAST 
in old Westerns like THE LAW AND JAKE WADE.  The story is usually 
of the reformed outlaw, a Robert Taylor type, who has hung up his 
guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability.  The old 
gang, however, wants to do one more job with their old buddy and 
sends a rabid Richard Widmark type to go and git Âim.  It is not a 
great plot.  In SEXY BEAST even the plot twists have gray beards.  
Perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was 
made not as a Western but as a stylish British gangster film.  It 
is an old plot dressed up to look new.
If the plot is old, at least the style is creative.  This is 
director Jonathan Glazer's first film, but he has reputedly done 
some notable TV ads for Guinness Stout.  His style does have some 
unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences.  
Cinematographer Ivan Bird uses a lot of half lit scenes.  We see 
one side of a person's faces.  But the other side fades into the 
darkness, a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters 
in-habit.  Half of everything that is happening is also kept 
hidden.
We Yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog.  At least 
in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the 
quiet speaking, the heavy accents, and the cockney language.
SEXY BEAST is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability 
in the US by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel 
genre, the London crime film.  The plot may be new to British 
crime films, but it would be overly familiar as a Western.  
Further respectability comes from Ben Kingsley's high-powered 
performance.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 
to +4 scale.

Susan Granger's review of "SEXY BEAST" (Fox Searchlight)
  Given the hype surrounding this stylish British thriller, there's less to it than meets the eye. Director Jonathan Glazer, best known for his commercials and music videos, executes the sordid gangster story with far more pace, pizzazz and polish one would expect. And that's evident from the quirky opening shot revealing the paunchy, bronzed body of Gal (Ray Winstone), a retired criminal, happily sunning himself on the patio of his villa on Spain's Costa del Sol, where he lives with his wife (Amanda Redman), a former porn star. Suddenly, as he places an ice-water compress on his overheated crotch, a massive boulder falls from an adjacent hillside, landing with a splash atop the intertwined hearts at the bottom of his azure pool. It's a harbinger of things to come as the tranquility of his sun-drenched, sybaritic idyll is threatened by the arrival of a hot-tempered former associate (Ben Kingsley) sent by a London mobster (Ian McShane) to recruit Gal for one last heist.!
 And this is a stubborn thug who won't take no for an answer. After a lethal battle-of-wills, redolent with pent-up rage, hapless Gal winds up in London taking part in a clever underwater robbery. So much for plot. It's the characters that count. Winstone portrays a resistant middle-aged man who is wildly in love with his wife, while the lean, mean Kingsley is charismatic as the forceful, defiant, psychotic criminal. Unfortunately, there are some surreal, self-indulgent, distracting dream sequences involving someone dressed as a menacing rabbit-demon, and the thick East London accents make the staccato dialogue and pervasive profanity often difficult to decipher. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Sexy Beast" is a grim, brutal, tawdry 5. Unless you're into a flashy, nasty Guy Ritchie "Snatch"-type story, you can do better.

SEXY BEAST (director: Jonathan Glazer; screenwriters: Louis Mellis/David Scinto;
cinematographer: Ivan Bird; editors: John Scott/Sam Sneade; cast: Ray Winstone
(Gal), Ben Kingsley (Don Logan), Ian McShane (Teddy Bass), Amanda Redman 
(Deedee), Cavan Kendall (Aitch), Julianne White (Jackie), Ãlvaro Monje
(Enrique), James Fox (Harry); Runtime: 91; Fox Searchlight Pictures; 2001-UK) 
The emptiness of this film and why its story is so unsatisfying in comparison
with its acidy acting and rollicking photography is because English director,
Jonathan Glazer, comes to filmmaking in his debut feature from music videos and
television commercials; he has succeeded only in making a violent film that is
ugly below its surface beauty. It's a film that discourages thinking and
aggressively forces one to revel in the forceful acting jobs going on by the
over-the-edge performance by sociopath Ben Kingsley, and the understated ones by
retired nice guy thief Ray Winstone and brazen mobster boss Ian McShane. In the
end, the performances don't mean much because the story doesn't amount to
anything. 
Gal (Winstone), who I gather is the sexy beast, is a retired London East End
thief living a relaxing life of luxury in his villa in Spain's Costa del Sol.
The heavyset, fortysomething, jewelry chain wearing hood is living with former
bad girl Deedee (Redman), someone he loves as much as a rose loves water. Guests
at his villa are his London underworld friends -- Aitch (Kendall) and his girl
Jackie (White). The highlight of the villa, which is in a remote area, is the
swimming pool, which is maintained by houseboy Enrique. When a boulder comes
tumbling down from the hill above the house and just misses Gal and lands in the
pool, the gangster's tranquility is only momentarily shaken. After all, he got
out of the toilet he considers England to be and has found peace in the hot
Mediterranean climate. 
The film's plot centers on Gal's ex-boss, a person who inspires fear, Don Logan
(Kingsley), who calls Jackie (someone he had wicked sex with) and tells her to
tell Gal that he's coming to see him because he's putting together a team for a
heist. The thing is Gal is retired and doesn't want to do the heist, but doesn't
know how to tell this to Don. When the bald-headed Don arrives, he intimidates
everyone and goes through a maddening cockney routine of gossip, profanity,
menacing threats, and weird jokes. The film could have used subtitles because
the cockney was laid on so thick it was almost incomprehensible to this
American's ears. 
Don tells Gal, by the side of his now empty pool with the small remains of a
boulder still evident after its removal, that Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) has
schemed for the last 5 months to heist an almost impossible series of
safes--which requires Gal's underwater talents to crack them open. When Gal
wishes to thank him for considering him for the job but, nevertheless, says no,
Don's aggressive manner goes to work and Gal is stuck with the familiar dilemma
used in many a gangster film: of a weary thief wanting to quit but outside
pressures make it difficult to do so. 
There's nothing special or interesting about the story; the film is pretty to
look at and moves at a rapid pace due to jump-cuts and fast editing, but what
happens is inconsequential and the film gets bogged down in its limitations.
There were also several surreal dream sequences that Gal has, but they seem
meaningless and add no weight to the story. It was hard to care about what
happens to Gal and his irksome pals and his beloved wife (someone he would do
anything for), and it was not possible to care one bit about the Kingsley
character. As far as the Kingsley characterization goes, it was too showy for my
taste to keep me riveted to such a pointless story.

If you thought that British films lacked a certain
edginess, then this should come as a shocking and a
pleasant surprise.  After all, with recent slushy fare
like "Billy Elliott" and "Bridget Jones's Diary," you
might think that British films have the feel of a
Three Musketeers candy bar.  Remember their slogan? 
Fluffy, not stuffy.  
Well, you won't find any fluff in "Sexy Beast."  The
stuff inside is a gritty, foul-mouthed film noir about
Gary (Ray Winstone), a retired gangster, who is
mercilessly coerced into performing one last heist. 
This is a tough-guy film for people who like tough-guy
films.
Gary has built a comfortable life for himself and his
wife with the fortune that he has amassed from his
previous jobs.  Residing in his idyllic Spanish
hillside villa, his toughest task seems to be trying
to avoid sunburn while lounging by his pool.  But an
afternoon dip, dinner with his wife, and drinks with
his friends are all that he wants.
His general state of bliss, however, is about to be
shattered when a former colleague visits him.  It's
none other than Don Largo (Ben Kingsley), a ruthless
criminal that needs Gary for an ambitious bank heist
back in London.
Wait a minute.  Can the words "ruthless" and "Ben
Kingsley" actually be used in the same sentence? 
Didn't he win an Oscar for his role as the irenic
Gandhi?  He has built his career on roles that
required quiet intensity.  Here, he is as tough and
threatening as they come.  Don't let that wiry frame
of his fool you.  There is more meanness packed within
that body than there is in a dozen junkyard dogs. 
It's quite a startling transformation.
It is this element of "Sexy Beast" that will grab your
attention.  Don looks like he could easily be snapped
in two.  Meanwhile, Gary has the build of a bear.  But
our likeable lummox is easily overmatched by Don's
brusque methods.  He continually backs down in fear as
Don first asks, then demands, and then threatens for
his involvement.  Much of this film centers on this
volatile fox-and-hound relationship.  Gary meekly
tries to sidestep the pressure, but Don's verbal
assault, which brims with curt yet poetic gangster
invective, is fearfully intimidating.  As the vicious
hoodlum continues to press and as the reluctant
retiree continues to retreat, we hope that Gary
somehow manages to survive this predicament.
While "Sexy Beast" showcased a great, dark turn by
Kingsley, there were a couple of things that were very
distracting.  The language was absolutely appalling. 
Its vituperative nature frequently made me
uncomfortable rather than awestruck with Don's
menacing nature.  There were some absurd moments of
comedy to break this cycle, such as banter that
revolved around falling boulders, goats, and
hairdressers.  But you can't get over the mountain of
foul language.
Even more difficult to filter through might be the
heavy Cockney brogue spoken by the actors.   It takes
a bit of concentration to understand what everyone is
talking about.  So, it becomes a tough exercise when
you have to absorb the foul language in addition to
the somewhat indecipherable accents.  Like Gary who
needed to work really hard to make Don understand his
situation, we may need to work equally hard to
understand the film's finer points as well.

Gary 'Gal' Dove (Ray Winstone, "The War Zone") is living a hedonistic life
on the southern coast of Spain with his beloved wife Deedee (Amanda Redman).
They tan in the blazing sun, swim in their custom pool, and eat and drink
with their best friends Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White).
One day, Gal's almost killed by an errant boulder which crashes into their
pool, cracking the tiles.  His day will be even more shook up when he learns
that the fearsome Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, "Rules of Engagement") is flying
in to get Gal back to London for a major heist in "Sexy Beast."
Working from a feature debut script by Louis Mellis and David Scinto,
commercial and music video director Jonathan Glazer, together with long-time
collaborator, director of photography Ivan Bird, makes a startlingly stylish
entry into the British gangster genre.  From the opening shot of the oiled
and tanning Ray Winstone highlighted by a background of sheer white, Glazer
lets us know we're in the hands of an accomplished image maker.
Glazer's no slouch with character development either.  We immediately can
feel that Gal's money comes from a shady background.  We also know that Gal
adores his wife Deedee.  Winstone and Redmond share a comfortable intimacy
on screen, which Glazer highlights with the fantastical as Deedee emerges from 
their pool framed in a smoky heart Gal's just blown from his cigar.
The tension becomes palpable when Jackie informs them that Don Logan's called
and is arriving the next day.  We're first introduced to Logan by the back
of Ben Kingsley's shaved dome, and damn if he doesn't project menace from even
that angle.  Kingsley, in a performance best described as psychotic pitbull,
won't take no for an answer from Gal, who keeps insisting that he's retired.
Logan lets Gal into a secret regarding Jackie, immediately regretting 
tipping his hand to his real agenda.  The four friends, together with Gal's
devoted Spanish pool boy, put up a protective front, but in the end, Gal
must return to London.
Glazer's sunbleached whites, blues and yellows abruptly turn to watery
grays and greens as Gal's greeted by rain and learns of the plot to rob a
vault by drilling underwater through the Turkish bath next door.  Teddy
Bass (Ian McShane), the operation's mastermind, is far more sinister than
Don Logan and Gal keeps Deedee in his mind like a beacon as he attempts to
circumvent the landmines of his former underworld.
"Sexy Beast" falls somewhere between the best of the genre - "The Long Good
Friday," for example, and the stylish hijinks of Guy Ritchie's "Snatch."
While Kingsley's barking madman is the attention getter, it's Winstone's
paunchy loverboy that has staying power.

No, it's not a porno movie.  It's yet another British crime caper film. 
And frankly, we'd rather have the porn.
Gal (Ray Winstone), an old time ex convict, is now retired.  All he does
is sweat by the pool, enjoy his form porn star wife Deedee (Amanda
Redman), and share drinks with a couple of good friends.  The setting is
Spain, the sun is hot, and life is free of trouble... until, of course,
one day when the peace must be disturbed -- and it is, by a guy named
Don Logan.  Presumably the titular sexy beast, Don (Ben Kingsley)
appears on the scene and hell breaks loose as Gal gets back into his
life of crime.
If you remember Kingsley's roles in Gandhi, Death and the Maiden, or
Schindler's List, you'll definitely be surprised.  His Don Logan, with
bald head, goatee, and wiry physique resembles a cobra when he is silent
and a crazed cockroach when he speaks.  Don's years in organized crime
have destroyed anything human he might have once had; he is now spooky,
profane, socially maladroit, and extremely annoying.
And he's anything but sexy.  In one scene, Don furiously leaves the
airplane after refusing to extinguish his cigarette.  Detained by
Spanish officials, he concocts a story of a sexual assault by a steward
-- the most darkly humored and misbegotten story of sexual harassment
one could conceive of.
As an actor, Kingsley has achieved what was required of his beastly Don:
You want to strangle him when he spits out profanities and run away when
he moves toward you.  The rest of the characters -- Gal (as played by
Winstone, who has delivered strong, nuanced performances in Nil By Mouth
and The War Zone), his wife, their friend Aitch (Cavan Kendall), and the
ominous mob boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) -- are all second-hand
parodies of cinematic stereotypes.  The film tries to convey Gal's
emotional turmoil in escaping his newfound life of crime, but it is
really only able to rise to B-movie standards.
Sexy Beast marks the directorial debut of award-winning commercial and
music video director Jonathan Glazer.  And I would sincerely hope that
after this film tanks, Glazer will be content, just like Gal at the
Spanish villa, to go back to more familiar terrain.  Sexy Beast,
conceived as a black comedy/thriller and shot as a commercial,
occasionally drips with irony and sometimes gives you pause, not knowing
whether to wince or laugh.  But mostly it just makes you shrug.  Well,
perhaps that was the idea.

Roger Ebert asks in his review of SEXY BEAST, "Who would have 
guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent 
movies would be played by...  Ben Kingsley?"  My response would be 
that anyone who has seen Alan Arkin in WAIT UNTIL DARK, Henry 
Fonda in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, or Anthony Hopkins in THE 
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS should have guessed it.  They should know 
that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is 
cast someone who generally plays mild, sympathetic, or even 
ineffectual character roles.  The same characteristics that make 
an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor 
when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious.  That is the 
principle that works for Kingsley in SEXY BEAST.
Gary "Gal" Dove (played by Ray Winstone) has retired from a London 
career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in Spain.  Life 
has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing.  But his 
paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch.  The first 
punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the 
villa.  The second punch comes from Gal's past.  Back in London 
gang boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane, TV's Lovejoy) is planning to 
break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants Gal.  He 
sends his most rabid henchman Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) to fetch 
Gal.  Don will accept any decision Gal makes from "yes" to 
"certainly."  However, if Gal says "no" Don will do whatever it 
takes to turn it into a yes including threatening Guy's ex-porn-
star wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman).  In the meantime Don knows just 
how to get under everybody's skin.  Kingsley makes Don a compact 
package of fury and nastiness.
There are some serious problems in Louis Mellis's and David 
Scinto's script that should have been caught before filming.  When 
we see the actual crime we have no idea why Gal was so important 
to its success.  Beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear, no 
special talents are required of him.  Any local hood could have 
done what Gal is needed for.  Additionally the crime involves 
digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault, flooding the 
vault.  No only could they have let the water out of the pool and 
avoided the complication altogether, but there is by far too much 
water to be accounted for by what was in the pool.
In spite of the provocative title, the story is cliched and overly 
familiar.  I know I have seen all the plot elements of SEXY BEAST 
in old Westerns like THE LAW AND JAKE WADE.  The story is usually 
of the reformed outlaw, a Robert Taylor type, who has hung up his 
guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability.  The old 
gang, however, wants to do one more job with their old buddy and 
sends a rabid Richard Widmark type to go and git Âim.  It is not a 
great plot.  In SEXY BEAST even the plot twists have gray beards.  
Perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was 
made not as a Western but as a stylish British gangster film.  It 
is an old plot dressed up to look new.
If the plot is old, at least the style is creative.  This is 
director Jonathan Glazer's first film, but he has reputedly done 
some notable TV ads for Guinness Stout.  His style does have some 
unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences.  
Cinematographer Ivan Bird uses a lot of half lit scenes.  We see 
one side of a person's faces.  But the other side fades into the 
darkness, a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters 
in-habit.  Half of everything that is happening is also kept 
hidden.
Us Yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog.  At least 
in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the 
quiet speaking, the heavy accents, and the cockney language.
SEXY BEAST is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability 
in the US by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel 
genre, the London crime film.  The plot may be new to British 
crime films, but it would be overly familiar as a Western.  
Further respectability comes from Ben Kingsley's high-powered 
performance.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 
to +4 scale.

I have declared my distaste for the postmodern Tarantino crime genre ad nauseam
so I feel no need to continue voicing it. Nevertheless, a film like "Sexy Beast"
usually comes marching along to ignite the genre beyond the usual expectations
and boy, does it ever. "Sexy Beast" is a firecracker thriller, as intense and
entertaining as "Reservoir Dogs" and about as menacing as "GoodFellas." 
The opening scene sets in a different tone than expected. We see a man basking
in the hot sun as he is lying on a chair near the pool. He starts using synonyms
for his peace of mind and relaxation. Before you know it, a boulder comes
crashing into his pool almost killing him in the process. His relaxation is
over, as is the audiences'. 
The man at peace in his glorious house and pool is Gal Dove (Ray Winstone), a
retired gangster who is trying to sooth his nerves. Those nerves become jangled
as the imminent arrival of a Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) is announced by Gal's
close friends, an ex-gangster sidekick (Cavan Kendall) and his exotic blonde
wife (Julianne White). Don Logan is feared by these people and rightly so. Logan
has come to recruit Gal for one last heist in London, a job commisioned by a
crime lord known as Teddy (Ian McShane). Problem is that Gal has no interest but
boy, does Don try to persuade him. Persuasion and insistence are Don's codes of
coercion - he will not take no for an answer. Don verbally and physically
attacks everyone in his sight, including Gal and his former porn star wife
(Amanda Redman), not to mention Gal's aforementioned friends. Never before have
I witnessed a cliched plot device delivered so brilliantly in terms of
desperation and sheer persuasion as shown here. 
Eventually, Gal ends up in London to perform the complicated heist, which
involves a highly secure bank and a Turkish bath! Teddy is the mastermind of
this heist and also inquisitive and persuasive, particularly involving the
mysterious disappearance of Don. This all results in one of the most conniving,
cunning and surprising climaxes I've seen in eons. 
Ben Kingsley is clearly the marvel of the film, a supreme scene-stealer. His
startling, piercing eyes and thick East End London accent will drive you bonkers
wishing he would just disappear. It is a performance of amazing intensity, all
the more amazing coming from Kingsley who has played bona fide saints in
"Gandhi" and "Schindler's List." He did play a suave gangster in "Bugsy" and
left a haunting impression in "Death and the Maiden," but neither role can
prepare you for what is easily the toughest villain since Joe Pesci's
trigger-happy act in "GoodFellas." 
Ray Winstone is also as assured as the quiet, implosive Gal. He wants out of the
crime world but one gets the sneaky suspicion that he craves the leisure and
laid-back living it can provide. Only someone like Don has given him reason to
quit for good and ever. 
One final performance that left me riveted was Ian McShane's icy, cold-blooded
Teddy - a character that is as dangerous and steely-eyed as Don. Combining these
two magnificent performances in one film can create terror in everyone's mind
for months on end. They would make James Bond's heart palpitate. 
"Sexy Beast" is directed by first-timer Jonathan Glazer, whose background is in
directing music videos. One would expect jump cuts galore and lots of loud rock
music from the Guy Ritchie crime school. Glazer eschews the in-your-face style
for a more formal, stable palette of fixed compositions (the swimming pool even
looks menacing at times). His focus is also on the characters, and the best
scenes are when Don and Gal are sitting by an umbrella table by the pool as the
sun sets its glow on Don's bald head. It is moments of that nature that bring an
unsettling tension to the film. No one-liners or clever postmodern,
wink-it's-only-a-movie moments that would cut away from the tension. Glazer is
as graceful and composed as most seasoned directors. 
"Sexy Beast" is not as much a heist film as it is about people involved in an
emotional crisis and mood swinging tempos, especially Gal's wife who loves her
husband dearly yet feels threatened as does everyone in the film. Exceptionally
performed, directed and photographed, "Sexy Beast" is like no crime film I've
seen before - a surreal, sometimes mind-bending trip into the allure of crime
and the leisure it offers. There are unforeseen obstacles and sometimes it is
less than glamorous in the underworld. When someone like Don Logan comes along,
there may be no way out.
