Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) by John Sylva    Rating: A
Too many films today rely solely on dialogue to tell their story, as nothing is
left for the imagination or mind to devour, but only for the ears to enjoy. 
"Snow Falling On Cedars," Australian director Scott Hicks' follow up to 1996's
heart warming "Shine," is almost dialogue free, relying on magnificent shots
and settings to tell the thoughtful story on their own.  This clever tactic
succeeds triumphantly, telling a complex story with deep meaning without a hint
of wear and tear, delivering some of the most powerful, heart wrenching scenes
in a motion picture this year, many without a word of dialogue.  Hicks
co-adapts "Snow" with Ronald Bass from the best selling novel of the same name,
penned by David Guterson.  If it wasn't for the stunning visuals, "Snow" could
have been a bumbling mess of a film, but instead is one of the year's
strongest.
The hypnotic, overwhelming picture of prejudice, truth, love, and war opens
just north of Puget Sound, where a fisherman is savagely murdered by the
suspected Japanese fisherman Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), who is charged for
murder and put on trial.  From this sequence, "Snow" has already wrapped you in
its artistic ways, leaving you spellbound in its beauty for the entire course
of the film.  "Snow" tells its story during the World War II era, in a time
where racial ties between the Chinese and American cultures weren't
particularly strong, a fact which later serves as a subplot between two central
characters.  Defending Miyamoto is Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow), an
elderly, caring man, prosecuting him Alvin Hooks (James Rebhorn), an efficient,
serious man.  As the trial unfolds, so does the deep plot in form of flashback,
mainly focusing on the romance between Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke),
newspaper journalist covering the trial, and Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Kudoh), who
later became wife to the convicted murderer.  We learn Ishmael and Hatsue had a
childhood love affair throughout their younger years, but were separated by the
war, in which Hatsue, along with her family, ended up in a camp, and Ishmael
was sent to battle, in which he'd lose an arm.  
The acting is up to par all around, mainly in supporting areas, where Kudoh
steals the show as her troubled, generally sad character.  Ethan Hawke may be
the main focus of the film, but is, for the majority of the film, silent. 
Kudoh and Hawke have wonderful on screen chemistry together, most of the time
tense and unstable, without a word being spoken, which adds to the realness of
the situations presented to the viewer.  The two particularly shine in the
final, unspeakably emotional final shots, which will entrance every bone in
your body with their sheer power.  Also of note is Max von Sydow, who delivers
a well executed performance in some of the film's most memorable scenes. 
Sydow's performance never feels restrained, as he lets you feel the sincerity
and devotedness of his character.
Appearing at first to be simply a murder mystery, "Snow Falling on Cedars"
tells multiple, enchanting stories throughout the course of the trial, all
connecting somehow to the characters within the courtroom.  The film is
captivating in a way which films rarely are, blinding you with its blistering
intelligence and stunning visuals.  "Snow" is a miraculous picture, an
absorbing, one of a kind thriller, that shows even more promise coming from
director Scott Hicks.  The characters within are real, strongly written souls
with much background to prove themselves worthy of their personalities.  The
film moves at a deliberately slow pace, building its story to a stronger level
with each passing minute, until everything about the plot becomes crystal
clear.  Hicks' direction has got to be the best in a film this year, pacing the
film in such a way to make the viewer anxious as to what will occur in the
coming moments.  The film transfers between war stories and love stories, all
which polish off this professional, unforgettable work of art.  "Snow" is
excitingly clever in the way which it tells its compelling story, always
presenting every image, from a dying fish to a pine tree, with artistic,
beautiful compassion.  Also worth praising is that "Snow" depicts the era in
which it is set realistically, revealing the awful things the U.S. did to
Japanese Americans as a result of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Provocative is
the best word to describe the atmospheric film, whose structure is so well
planned and thoughtful, it's hard to decipher how one could be so talented to
put this film together.  The rich musical score serves as a perfect backdrop
for the real star of the show, the setting, playing out loud, melodic pieces to
aid the moving story.
"Snow Falling on Cedars" is a rare gem, that doesn't follow the simple path
most courtroom thrillers take.  If this route was taken, every ounce of beauty
and cleverness would be sucked dry from the film, as the originality of the
script is what makes "Snow" glisten in so many departments.  Many will dislike
the film for its choice of narrative structure, but to some, "Snow" should
undoubtedly stand as one of the year's best, most breathtaking films.  Words
can't describe the lush settings of "Snow," or the captivating story, so to
experience what the film has to offer, it's best to travel to your theater,
kick back with your popcorn, and embrace the power and beauty that is, "Snow
Falling on Cedars."
The Bottom Line: "Snow Falling on Cedars" is a rich, beautiful, compassionate
film with heavy subject matter, that unfolds flawlessly, against eye popping,
mind blowing backdrops.  A triumph.

Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) 1 star out of 4. Starring Ethan Hawke,
Youki Kudo, Sam Shepard and Max Von Sydow. Written by Ron Bass and Scott
Hicks. Directed by Hicks.
 "Snow Falling on Cedars" is a languid character study propped up by
fine cinematography and beautiful scenery.
 Unfortunately, that is not enough to sustain this snail-paced feature.
 The movie's biggest flaw is one common to most Hollywood films that
deal with people of other cultures - it approaches situations from a
white, Western perspective.
 Set in post-World War II Washington state, the crux of the story is the
murder trial of a Japanese-American fisherman and the prejudice it
arouses.
 The film's hero is a newspaper reporter who has a personal stake in the
case because the wife of the accused is his childhood sweetheart. And
while she has moved on, he still carries a torch for her.
 "Snow Falling on Cedars" lacks passion and fire. It is as cold as the
frigid landscape that director Scott Hicks continually enjoys
intercutting throughout the drama.
 It doesn't help that the hero, Ishmael Chambers, is portrayed by Ethan
Hawke as a sad-faced piner who seems to be daydreaming throughout the
entire proceedings. 
 How he finally solves the mystery seems a mystery, since it appears he
hasn't been paying attention to anything that has been going on in the
courtroom.
 The feature is really two stories - a murder mystery and a love story.
Where they intersect is at the character of Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki
Kudoh).
 As children, Hatsue and Ishmael were in love. Then the war came along,
and Hatsue and her family were carted off to an internment camp.
 Returning after the war, Ishmael finds that Hatsue has married, while
Hatsue and her family find they have been cheated out of the land they
were promised would be held for them by a kindly neighbor.
 Despite what sounds like an intriguing story, "Snow Fall on Cedars" is
dull, with a limpid payoff.
 The fault lies in the script, adapted by Oscar-winner Ron Bass ("Rain
Man") and Hicks from the novel by David Guterson, which fails to bring
any of the characters to life. They all seem so subdued, so lifeless.
 And Hicks' direction isn't any help. It lacks speed and pace. It just
drifts like a ship lost in a fog. It is dark and dank.
 Hicks' intention may have been to allow us to get to know his
characters, but none of them have much meat, so we have nothing to chew
on.
 For example, it is almost three-quarters of the way through the movie
before you realize that Ishmael lost an arm fighting in Europe during
the war. 
 The movie only comes alive during its courtroom sequence, which
features a rousing portrayal by Max Von Sydow as the wily, elderly
defense lawyer.
 In the small roll of Ishmael's father, Sam Shepard is dignified, a bit
fiery and compassionate.
 "Snow Falling on Cedars" was supposed to be a movie that would melt
your heart. Instead its lack of spirit, of moral outrage, leaves you
cold.

When a tight shot of freshly caught fish gasping for air on the puddled
floorboards of a small fishing boat is saturated with all the aesthetics of
a Renoir painting ... you know you're in for an artistically filmed
production. Well "Cedars" won't let you down. Scrupulously, meticulously,
caringly exposed on the negative, this picture is one of the richest
cinematographic efforts of the year.
The art doesn't stop with the image. Attentive and crisp sounds accentuate
the visual buffet. The crackling ignition of a match, the pouring of hot
tea: this is an abundantly textured film. Additionally, the score
refreshingly fuses new age with traditional movie music composition.
Oddly, this love story is really more of a courtroom drama; however, as soon
as we realize this, the artistry and the plot line unfortunately take off in
different directions.
We view this 1930-1950's story mostly through the eyes of hesitant reporter
Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) who as a child and teen shared a secret
romance with a Japanese girl from his small town. When the woman's husband
is accused of murder, Ishmael has to battle his 20-year-old obsession in
order to decide if he should help defend the man that stole his girl.
One of the film's finest moments finds the widow on the stand, attorney
mouthing muted words while passionate memories of her husband play out on
screen to screaming violins.
The leads aren't particularly strong, but Richard Jenkins as the Sheriff
gives a great supporting performance and Max Von Sydow is charming as the
defense lawyer. Fine casting.
I was trembling with excitement over this film until the halfway mark when
the art became more than a tad indulgent neglecting its responsibility to
story, making the film rather disproportionate. "Cedars" toys with a love
fable, toys with making a statement of Japanese suffrage (the concentration
camps for Japanese-Americans during W.W.II), spends a lot of time in the
courtroom, but is ultimately a tale of one man's wrestle with an obsession
recorded on film in a fashion far superior to its story. Still, it is simply
the most beautiful courtroom drama you'll ever see.

The opening shot of SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS shows a white miasma:  it's hard 
to tell if we are in a dream sequence, underwater, or in a thick fog.  It 
turns out to be the fog, and we see many other striking shots filmed in the 
same artful and patient manner.  The film is beautifully photographed by 
cinematographer Robert Richardson:  in fact, the imagery, along with the 
roundabout storytelling by director Scott Hicks, helps to make a rather 
ordinary story into a very appealing one.
The order of Hicks's narrative is all out of whack;  it's on purpose, of 
course, as Hicks takes chances with flashbacks and brief memories.  One 
advantage is that we escape a long, uninterrupted courtroom scene:  instead, 
we are able to watch segments blended well with the background tales that 
led to the trial.  A second plus is discovering the motivations of various 
characters, the timing acting most of the time as an engaging surprise.
The action takes place in the fictional county of San Piedro, on an island 
off Washington state, between the years 1941 and 1951.  A Japanese-American 
fisherman, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), is on trial for the murder of a 
fellow fisherman.  Kazuo has an ancient but brilliant defense lawyer, Nels 
Gudmundsson (Max Von Sydow); the other side however, has a cagey prosecutor, 
Alvin Hooks (James Rebhouse), as well as the collective prejudice of the 
jury and white community.  Who will prevail?  The trial ends up occupying 
our interest less than the stories that engendered it.
Up in the courtroom balcony the editor of the "Island Review" newspaper, 
Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), is observing the trial.  Even more closely, 
he observes Kazuo's wife Hatsue.  A backstory shows us how they grew up 
together, fell in love, and separated tragically.  Again, prejudice results 
in family and community rejecting any type of mixed marriage;  the theme 
carries farther with the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps for the 
duration of the Second World War.
Some of the most affecting scenes in the film show these citizens, many of 
them residents of the area for years, uprooted and loaded into army trucks 
bound for California.  A drumbeat with spare accompaniment plays as these 
people leave their lives and belongings, and march into an exile imposed by 
the United States government.  Hatsue has refused Ishmael's proposal of 
marriage, and leaves with her family.  In shots used in the movie trailer, 
we see Ishmael's face in a car window, Hatsue's reflected from the outside.  
They are separated.
Clearly his love for Hatsue has consumed much of his attention, turning into 
an obsession.  The plot gains some complication from Ishmael's stumbling 
upon evidence important to the trial.  It's here that the plausibility 
weakens, as the situation dictates that Ishmael must have adequate 
motivation for withholding material that could exonerate a man of a murder 
charge.  Ethan Hawke has never struck me as an actor who could play 
vindictive: all the more reason why the script, by Hicks and veteran 
screenwriter Ron Bass, should give his character stronger incentive to think 
about behavior so drastic.
Hawke is fine in all other scenes, wistful and pensive and lovesick. 
Ishmael's parents, Arthur and Helen, are portrayed by Sam Shepard and 
Caroline Kava, and they supply very strong support.  Arthur Chambers is the 
newspaperman with integrity, refusing to back down when townspeople cancel 
their ads and subscriptions, and deliver telephone threats, because they 
hate the editor's support of the Japanese-American community.  Shepard 
sports thin wire-rimmed spectacles, giving him a wise and avuncular look.  
In the film's later time setting, 1951, Arthur is dead and Ishmael's mother 
takes a bigger role.  As a matter of fact, she is aware of her son's 
preoccupation with Hatsue, and tells him what he must ultimately do:  Forget 
her, she's a married woman.
Max Von Sydow delivers a deceptively simple performance.  Though he makes 
his role seem effortless, one can imagine the thought the actor put into his 
speech and body language.  As I watched him I could not help but think:  
what if the casting director and Hicks had switched the actors playing the 
lawyers?  What could Von Sydow have done in the role of the prosecutor 
trying to convict the hapless fisherman?  James Rebhorn, after all, was 
typecast as this slightly slippery, pencil-mustache-wearing attorney.
As the object of Ishmael's love, Youki Kudoh plays Hatsue with a nice 
understatement.  Here the script helps in clarifying the way a woman of 
Japanese descent must act: "You wouldn't understand," a young Hatsue tells a 
teenage Ishmael.  Kudoh often appears wide-eyed and stunned, but this 
expression is usually part of the cultural mores that dictated her 
behaviors.
Between sequences of non-linear narration, the visual storytelling is often 
inspired.  True to the title, snow falls on tall, shred-barked cedars, as 
well as on a breathtaking and rugged countryside.  The set is also decorated 
with countless vintage vehicles.  But the most striking visuals include 
strangely beautiful underwater images:  the drowned fisherman sinking, the 
soupy fog, even Ishmael in full combat gear floating downward in his attempt 
to participate in an assault on an enemy beach.  To an extent, most of the 
main characters seem at some point to be suffocating, oppressed by the 
closeness of ignorance and hate and injustice.  Whereas what we see often 
inspires awe, the filmmakers went out their way to simulate a period mood by 
using sepia-tinted film throughout much of the story.  In many scenes this 
aura of brown grew distracting:  why not just use black and white, or a miz 
of color and non-color, instead of a fake tinge of age?
The film is rated PG-13 for one instance of strong language, love-making 
scenes, and images of battle carnage and corpses.  Parents would feel 
comfortable taking most 12 year-olds to view with them.

   When O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering his
ex-wife and her friend, critics of the jury system and of
lawyers' tactics were quick to pounce on the verdict.  Given
the racial makeup of the jury and the defense team's alleged
playing of the race card, cynics and detractors in general
were quick to say that the decision was based not on the
evidence but on the willingness of minority jurors to free an
African-American simply because of his race.  What we
all know, though, is that the situation has almost always been
the reverse: jurors have been quick to find innocent people
guilty if the defendants were members of minority groups. 
During this film-packed Christmas period, moviegoers have
been treated to a story depicting a flagrant case of such
injustice by taking in Universal Studios' "The Hurricane," in
which Denzel Washington plays a prizefighter unjustly found
guilty of a murder and warehoused for a couple of decades
because of racial prejudice.  High-school students are still
assigned "To Kill a Mockingbird" in sophomore English class,
Harper Lee's powerful tale of a Southern lawyer who defends
a black man accused of rape.  (Kids lucky enough to catch a
revival of Robert Mulligan's 1962 movie starring Gregory
Peck and introducing Robert Duvall could get by without
reading the book.)
   Now, David Guterson's multi-layered, PEN/Faulkner prize-
winning novel, "Snow Falling on Cedars," has been adapted
to the screen by Scott Hicks, whose "Shine" proved that
director's mettle in examining the life of pianist David
Helfgott, who had been pushed to the edge by a demanding
father.  Using flashbacks to a greater extent than he did in
that 1996 film--in fact employing flashbacks within flashbacks,
overlapping dialogue, and a great emphasis on ambiance and
mood--Hicks is not as successful in translating this hugely
successful novel for a movie audience.  Pushing James
Newton Howard's moody score to the limit while zigzagging
back and forth to events in the lives of a newspaper reporter,
his Japanese love interest, a man accused of murdering his
best friend, and groups of Japanese forcibly evacuated to
wartime interment camps, Hicks has virtually abandoned all
aspects of linear storytelling to the service of fancy camera
work.  Though he does this in a far more skillful way than a
young film student, he nonetheless overemphasizes 
technique, thus blurring the tale's coherence and leaving the
audience flustered.  Though some scenes caught by
cinematographer Robert Richardson of snow falling on
the titled cedars in the Pacific Northwest are stunning--much
like images captured in movies like "The Sweet Hereafter"
and "The Ice Storm"--they cannot compensate for the oblique
narration of a compelling tale, one which highlights the nature
of American prejudice, the potential for inequity in our
criminal justice system, the value of courageous journalism,
and the heartbreak of a thwarted love affair.
   "Snow Falling on Cedars" is set in 1951, just six years after
the conclusion of World War 2, in the fictional town of San
Piedro near Puget Sound in the state of Washington.  Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a Japanese-American who served the
U.S. as a lieutenant in the war, is on trial for the murder of
his best friend, a white man.  Despite Miyamoto's service for
his country he is nonetheless hated by segments of the
community as are other Japanese living there, as bitter
memories of the war die slowly.  A journalist covering the
trial, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), is seated in the
balcony, but he is not an impartial spectator.  He is
torn between the liberal-humanist ideas of his journalist
father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), and the enmity he bears for
having lost an arm during the war and, perhaps more
important, having lost his girl friend, Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki
Kudoh), now married to the defendant.  
   A more straightforward telling of this story would have
served us better.  We did not need to wait until the final
segments of the movie to learn that Ishmael lost an arm while
fighting, nor does Hicks serve us well by showing the battle
scene in such a minimalist style that we can scarcely
appreciate that Ishmael was in the midst of raging combat. 
Nor can we be sure on which front Ishmael was fighting. 
While flashbacks are an appropriate device in a visual art like
the cinema--as well as in literature--we are treated to an
arbitrary repetition of the mechanism as Hicks takes us now
to Ishmael and Hatsue expressing teen love, then back to the
more recent past, then once again to their early childhood,
back again to the present day. Hicks does a better job when
he illustrates what the U.S. government did with many
Japanese-Americans--rounding them up and shipping them to
fenced-off camps for the duration of the war--a practice not
executed against German-Americans or Italian-Americans at
all.  (Alan Parker, who dazzled us just this month with
"Angela's Ashes," reminded us of one of our country's great
injustices in his 1990 film "Come See The Paradise," about a
hotheaded union organizer who is separated from his
Japanese-American wife after Pearl Harbor when she and her
family are sent to such a camp.)
   Twenty-nine year old Ethan Hawke, so dynamic in the film
"The Eighth Day," doesn't get a chance to do much other
than look glum and passive, with many of the love scenes
between him and Youki Kudoh played by a younger version
of his character (Reeve Carney), but Youki Kudoh turns in a
fine performance as the conflicted love object ordered by her
mother--like the Rebeka Johnson character, Sylvia, in "Liberty
Heights" to marry her own kind.  Max von Sydow is the
scene-stealer, though, as the defendant's gentle attorney
Nels Gudmundsson, who tells the jury that since he is
virtually looking death in the face, he can prize from long
experience the need for justice.  While all loose ends are
ultimately tied up--Ishmael learning that he must hold on to
his father's principles while letting go of his great love--"Snow
Falling on Cedars" falls victim to overly pretentious film
technique.

Based on the acclaimed novel by David Gutterson, âSnow Falling on Cedars,â? 
directed by Scott Hicks (1996âs âShineâ?), is a sumptuous, meticulously 
poetic motion picture that refreshingly tells much of its story through 
strikingly beautiful visual images, rather than a lot of dialogue. One could 
complain that some of the characters are never fully realized, including the 
central figure of the story, but those that say such a thing, perhaps, have 
missed the point. The film consistently weaves in and out of the present and 
the past, based on peopleâs recollections, and, as in real life, memories 
often consist of nothing more than pictures, rather than words. 
Superficially a courtroom mystery, in which a young Japanese fisherman, Kazuo 
Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is being tried for the alleged murder of a man on a 
fog-induced night in the Pacific Northwest, circa 1950, what the film truly 
is, at heart, is a moving romance, as well as a documentation of the 
treatment of the Japanese, and their division with the Anglo population, 
sparked from World War II. Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) is a novice 
reporter who has returned to his hometown in the dead of winter (and a very 
heavy snowstorm) to cover the trial, which means much more to him than the 
usual news story because his childhood love and, he believes, soul mate, is 
Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), now Kazuo's loyal wife. As adolescents, Ishmael and 
Hatsue had fallen deeply in love with each other, but Hatsue decided, based 
on her mother's and the general public's belief, that the Japanese "should 
stick to their own kind." The majority of the residents of the small fishing 
town believe that Kazuo has to be the guilty one, but Ishmael suspects 
otherwise, and sets out to seek the truth, all the while pondering from afar 
about how his life might have been different had he and Hatsue followed their 
hearts ten years before.
Told out of chronological order, with flashbacks to Ishmael and Hatsue as 
children, teenagers, and Ishmael during and after fighting in WWII, and 
flashbacks within flashbacks, "Snow Falling on Cedars" is just as 
effortlessly told as an Atom Egoyan film (i.e. 1997's "The Sweet Hereafter"), 
and largely gains much of its effectiveness on the way the multiple stories 
beautifully and imperceptibly are revealed and transpire, akin to reading a 
complex, but very much satisfying, novel. Because the time period and 
storylines are changing throughout, there is no chance of any one of them 
(the trial, the romance, and the historical relevance) overstaying their 
welcome. 
There are many dazzling, powerful sequences to be had within, including when 
Hatsue and her family, along with the rest of the Japanese in the town, are 
forced out of their homes and shipped off to internment camps, which is an 
example of complete bravura filmmaking. The scene looking back at the close 
relationship between Hatsue and Ishmael when they were younger is also 
superbly filmed and fastidious in detail. And the portrayal of the way the 
whites in the town look at the Japanese is also accurate and, thankfully, not 
overwrought. The music, by James Newton Howard, strikingly aids in 
underscoring the scenes.
There's really no way a person could possibly pen a review for "Snow Falling 
on Cedars" without mentioning its clearest and most worthy attribute, which 
is the exquisite, occasionally awe-inspiring cinematography, by Robert 
Richardson. Not only should the film be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination in 
this category (and deservedly, the award), but it many times left me in, 
basically, a wide-eyed gaze at the unbelievably beautiful images that were 
appearing on the screen, one after the other. Shots of rainy forests, and 
water dripping off of the leaves of plants, and snow-blanketed trees and 
mountains and whole, wide landscapes left me wondering if it was actually 
real (for it surely looked awfully believable), or billions of tons of fake 
snow, or a visual effect. Either way, never has snow looked as gorgeous and 
alluring and threatening as it does here.
The performances in the picture are not very flashy and, at times, are 
threatened to blend into the background. This posed a problem for me several 
times throughout, as I felt that the film was marvelously engaging to look 
at, but emotionally mute. Luckily, director Scott Hicks would prove me wrong 
immediately after each time my mind would wander to such a thought, with a 
stunner of a scene that left a precise dramatic impact. The last scene is 
particularly one of subtle, but unavoidably impassioned beauty. Of the cast, 
Youki Kudoh is a standout as Hatsue Miyamoto. She is so good, and so 
well-cast, that at times, her facial expressions say it all, and she doesn't 
even need to speak what she is thinking.
"Snow Falling on Cedars" probably isn't a film for everyone. While all mature 
audiences will be able to grasp its important themes and meaning, those 
partial to Hollywood movies with a lot of action or predictable comedy and 
romance will not be taken under its, overall, exquisite spell, due to a 
deliberately slow pace that cherishes and respects each and every one of its 
shots, and does not follow all of the rules of this sort of genre. 
Nevertheless, those audiences looking for a more challenging and intricate 
viewing experience will be genuinely delighted with the visual and emotional 
rewards that "Snow Falling on Cedars" has to offer.

Befitting of its picturesque name, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS sure is pretty
to watch.  But it doesn't take long to realize that the film moves with
the same plodding pace as a man trying to trudge uphill along an unplowed
street following a blizzard.  Exquisitely beautiful but excruciatingly
slow sums up Scott Hicks' (SHINE) latest endeavor.
The film takes a look at stateside Japanese-American relations during the
time of the Second World War.  Set in the scenic Pacific Northwest, SNOW
FALLING ON CEDARS centers around a murder trial where American-born Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune in his film debut) is accused of murdering his boyhood
friend, an American fisherman.
Covering the trial is Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke, GATTICA), a young
newspaperman for the small community on San Piedro Island.  As we see in a
series of flashbacks, Ishmael has a number of conflicting emotions at
work.  Most importantly, the defendant's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh,
MYSTERY TRAIN) was Ishmael's secret childhood sweetheart in a severed
relationship which was never reconciled.  At least, not as far as Ishmael
was concerned.
Secondly, there's the memory of his father (Sam Shepard, SAFE PASSAGE),
also a newspaperman who had the conviction to take an unpopular stand
against the injustice being carried out via the internment of
Japanese-American citizens during the 1940's.  This earned Ishmael's
father the respect of the Japanese community and has given Ishmael some
mighty big shoes to fill.  The tension, what little there is, comes from
our wondering whether Ishmael will even try.
Based upon the award winning novel by David Guterson, the screenplay (Ron
Bass, ENTRAPMENT and Scott Hicks, SHINE) takes a non-lineal approach to
telling its story, jumping from decade to decade, from prewar to postwar
to finally, in the war.   While this can often be an effective device,
here it serves to distance us from the characters instead of drawing us
into them.  Instead of revealing more about the characters' lives, each
flashback merely adds another layer onto them, like a fresh snow will add
a pristine blanket to a rural landscape.
Mr. Hawke underplays his character and his conflicting emotions almost to
the point that we will be excused for thinking that he didn't have any.
Whether mooning  or pining away for his "forbidden love" of Hatsue, most
of his anguish is internalized and unexpressed.
Ms. Kudoh is just as enigmatic, leaving Hatsue's emotional life to be
displayed by the actress who played the character as a young girl.  In
fact, we gain more insight into Ishmael and Hatsue from the fine work done
by young Reeve Carney and Ann Suzuki who play the same characters as
children than we do from their adult counterparts.
Max Von Sydow (WHAT DREAMS MAY COME) as Kazuo's defense attorney,
provides support in what is a relatively minor role as does Sam Shepard as
the principled newspaperman and father to Ishmael.
Taking a stand by publicly denouncing the government's mistreatment of
the Japanese-American community who lived on San Piedro Island was not
without a price.  Ishmael's father was scorned, his paper lost
subscribers, and his family was threatened with physical harm.  That type
of reaction is one which we conceivably may experience in our own lives
whenever we choose to stand upon the truth of God's Word.  God's Word
prepares those who choose to follows Its teachings by letting us know what
to expect from those with opposing views:
"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."  1 John 3:13 [KJV]
"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they
are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."  John 17:14 [KJV]
Taking a stand because it is the right thing to do is oftentimes hard
because we know that it may make us unpopular for a time.  What we should
remember is that it also makes us well-pleasing in God's sight.  And
ultimately, it is for Him we live.

SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS (director/writer: Scott Hicks; screenwriter:
novel by  David Guterson/Ron Bass; cinematographer: Robert Richardson;
editor: Hank Corwin; cast: Ethan Hawke (Ishmael Chambers), James
Cromwell (Judge Fielding), Richard Jenkins (Sheriff Art Moran), James
Rebhorn (Alvin Hooks), Sam Shepard (Arthur Chambers), Max von Sydow
(Nels Gudmundsson), Youki Kudoh (Hatsue Miyamoto), Rick Yune (Kazuo
Miyamoto); Runtime: 126; 1999)
What I didn't need was Australian director/writer of "Cedars," Scott
Hicks ("Shine"), to tell me what a bad thing the internment of Japanese
Americans during World War II was for a little over two hours of a
darkly photographed film and then precede to bore me to death with a
glum romantic/courtroom drama, that never got untracked, but seemed so
proud of itself for being so politically correct in taking a stand
against bias. All the film's great social themes and plays on morality,
were too docile and too manipulatively inflated to hold my interest.
The film is set in the Pacific Northwest of Washington, in an island
fishing village in the early 1950s, where the weather was either misty
or snowing. The first part of the film, just stagnated, as uninvolving
flashbacks filled the screen and uninteresting storytelling techniques
prevailed, without fleshing out the reality of the characters except to
see them in wooden terms.
A fisherman is found dead, entangled in his net and the sheriff who
discovers the body suspects foul play. Through flashbacks at the trial
that visually move back and forth from present to past, we learn that
the fisherman was a childhood friend of Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), who
is being accused of the murder because he was the last one on the boat
with the fisherman and had a motive for killing him. He is a decorated
Japanese American war veteran, whose family was to buy land from the
fisherman's white family but missed their payments when Miyamoto's
family was sent to the detention camp for the remainder of the war. He
is now asking his childhood fishing partner to consider going against
his mother and sell him the land. The fisherman's mother was bias
against the Japanese because of Pearl Harbor and sold the land to a
white farmer, returning to the Japanese family all the money they put
into the land for payments.
Into the picture, in the middle of a snow storm, the reluctant hero of
the film, Ishmael Chambers (Hawke), smelling a story that intrigues him,
as he is now a reporter on the same paper his father was a
crusading-editor (Shepherd), who sought justice for the Japanese
Americans during WW11, reminding his readers that they are our
neighbors. Ishmael had fallen madly in love with Kazuo's wife, Hatsue
(Youki Kudoh), as a teenager when they grew up so close to each other,
but she sent him a "Dear John" letter after her mother urged her to only
marry a Japanese boy, when she was in the camp and he was fighting in
the South Pacific.
At the trial, ponderously played, featuring various forms of flashback:
we see a fair-minded judge (Cromwell), a one-dimensional bigoted D.A.
(Rebhorn), and the defense attorney Gudmundsson (Max Von Sydow), who
tries to steal every scene he is in with his sometimes melliflous and
other times doddering spiel in defense of Kazuo, bringing up a  corny
liberal argument against prejudice, and finally telling the court
humanity itself is on trial. Von Sydow reflects the opinions of the
author of the popular novel the film is based on, David Guterson.
Everything seemed so contrived, the film had no fresh air to breathe,
the cinematography was darkly uninspiring, the courtroom seemed to be
staged only as a reason to give the filmmaker his chance to applaud
himself for being so free of bias.
The kicker to the story comes from Ishmael, when he decides to come to
terms with the bitterness of being rejected by Hatsue and he turns over
to the court in the nick of time evidence he had discovered of her
husband's innocence. Everything seemed so mechanical: the acting, the
story, and the directing; everything was so dutifully right, the film
left me asleep in the cedars, as I was unable to see what the fuss was
about in telling Americans that their country shamefully put Japanese
Americans in internment camps during the war. What's the surprise? Don't
they teach that in the high school social studies courses anymore?

Despite being a visual marvel and cinematic triumph, Snow Falling on 
Cedars is ultimately a failure in terms of living up to its potential 
and expectations. That Universal is marketing this film for Best Picture 
is an insult to the Academy's intellect. The production does have 
moments of glory, namely riveting courtroom scenes and the 
aforementioned cinematography.
It is December, 1950 in the state of Washington and prejudice runs thick 
among locals. One morning an American body is found murdered at sea. The 
man soon standing trial is Japanese. To Kill A Mock85oops, sorry, I =
mean Snow Falling on Cedars focuses on the obvious racism involved. As 
someone points out of the trial "Every once in a while, somewhere in the 
world, humanity goes on trial."
The film is based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. Humor 
aside, there is a strong argument that this work is little more than a 
poorly disguised adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. The only major 
difference is that in To Kill a Mockingbird the stories and characters 
outside of the trial are well developed and intriguing. Here they are 
like a random collage. In that sense, Snow Falling on Cedars is more 
like Mike Figgis' awful film The Loss of Sexual Innocence where footage 
of unrelated stories was shot and randomly assembled on an editing 
table.
The court scenes are truly excellent and even solicit memories of 
classics like Inherit the Wind. Max Von Sydow plays Nels Gudmundson, the 
defense lawyer. Like the brilliant Dustin Hoffman in Sleepers, he is 
shaky and visually unintimidating. But when his character goes after 
witnesses it is truly a classic courtroom drama. Von Sydow should be 
applauded and may even see his name as a long shot Best Supporting Actor 
nomination. Equally magnificent is James Cromwell as the presiding 
judge, determined to have a trial without prejudice.
Snow Falling on Cedars is a genuinely attractive film. The 
title-descriptive winter scenery could easily comprise a calendar (a 
rarity for any image absent a semi-nude woman in the 90's.) 
Interestingly, the camera is almost always either focussed on a 
person's face or a large, rich scene. There are very few half-way 
shots. These facial portraits are further enhanced by being only half 
lit, yin-yang style. Unfortunately even this engaging technique sheds 
light on a flaw: everyone's makeup is perfect. When people sweat, cry 
or are just themselves, their faces are a little too beautiful to be 
believed.
The court scenes are particularly effective because the script creates a 
genuine hatred towards certain prejudice characters. Not since Jack 
Nicholson's riveting performance in A Few Good Men has a film been so 
effective at creating such feelings towards a witness. Just as facial 
portraits reveal unrealistic makeup, dE9j=E0 vu of that 1991 production =
is a too strong to be ignored. The pinnacle of this is when a witness is 
questioned about their phone calls in the same manner that Tom Cruise 
bombarded Nicholson some eight years ago.
It is most unfortunate that courtroom drama, excellent acting and visual 
ecstasy like this must be ruined by murky plot lines and poor 
adaptation. Ironically, yin-yang is more than just some characters' 
portraits, it is an underlying theme of Snow Falling on Cedars.

The timing of events often has a great impact on a person's life. The
central theme of this film is how an intimate relationship between two
people can be affected by a large, outside force beyond their control.
The central character in the story is newspaperman Ishmael (Ethan
Hawke), who writes for the town newspaper he inherited from his father
in a small hamlet in the Pacific Northwest. He is a war veteran
scarred by the loss of his childhood sweetheart, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh),
who terminated their long-standing relationship while he was fighting
overseas. The story begins when Hatsue's husband, Kazuo (Rick Yune),
is charged with the murder of a local fisherman.
Although the events of Kazuo's trial form the primary component of the
plot, the heart of the story is the relationship between Ishmael and
Hatsue, and the forces that doomed it. Director Scott Hicks skillfully
intermixes the two parallel stories. Their relationship is
sporadically recounted as flashbacks, from to their friendship as
children to their breakup as young adults. The force they could not
stop was World War II, and its residual effects on American society.
Anti-Japanese sentiment is a destructive force for the couple and a
primary component of the trial. The trial overtly explores the
elements that played more subtly between Ishmael and Hatsue.
The core of the film is satisfying but it occasionally becomes tiring
when the story overuses melodramatic elements. The issue of racism
injects melodrama, but breaks no new ground. The core of the story has
wrapped up when Ishmael talks with Kazuo's lawyer, Nels Gudmundsson
(Max von Sydow), about the helpless course of human life controlled by
fate. It is a moving scene that sums up the entire story.
Recommended. This is a slow, introspective film which examines closure
for things lost. Although the story overuses the issue of racism for
dramatic effect, the exploration of the central theme is a rewarding
experience.

The transformation of an intricate novel into a successful film can be
a daunting task. Filmmakers must effectively generate symbolism and
imagery onto the screen, instead of allowing the readers to interpret
it for themselves. That's why people are always saying that a movie
was never as good as the book.
Unfortunately, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS, directed by Scott Hicks
(SHINE), is a prime example of an unsuccessful interpretation of a
tremendous novel.
Set in 1951 on a fictional island called San Piedro, just north of
Puget Sound, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), an American-born man of
Japanese descent, is on trial for murder. In this small town, the
Anglo and Japanese-American populations had long lived in relative
harmony until Pearl Harbor dragged half the town's population into
internment camps.  Kazuo was a veteran of the war and served in the US
military, but despite his ranking and valor, he is stigmatized as a
"Jap" and faces long odds in the racially polarized town. Ethan Hawke
(REALITY BITES) plays Ishmael Chambers, the local reporter who may
have evidence crucial to Kazuo's innocence. But Ishmael's past links
him to Kazuo's wife Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Koudo), whom he loved as a
child in a forbidden romance. As the trial unfolds, and the outcome
doesn't look good for Kazuo, Ishmael must decide to whether or not to
intervene.
What takes pages and pages of complex thought and explanation for
character development in a book seems merely happenstance when
explained in the context of a two-hour film. For example, we know that
Ishmael's character is morally astute, but the movie fails to portray
just how difficult it is for him to help absolve Kazuo from guilt. Why
would he wait when someone's life was hanging in the balance? Another
problem is the film's editing. Attempting to get its arms around a
vast amount of information, it confusingly bounces back and forth from
childhood, to war, to funerals, to internment camp, to weddings, and
so on. This montage blending of past with present appears tries to
chop together a dozen plot elements that don't make sense. Example:
halfway through the film, we learn that Ishmael went to war and lost
his arm. Are we supposed to interpret his indifference toward Kazuo's
fate as revenge for his battle wound that he blames on his lost love
for Miyamoto? I have no idea.
With a large ensemble cast of impressive actors, a lot of the talent
was wasted on roles that were limited because the film was in a
constant time warp. However, Max Von Sydow plays an Oscar-worthy
supporting role as the attorney assigned to defend Kazuo. His demeanor
is grandly stoic as he is faced with a tremendous task.
Do yourself a favor and read the book. In the two hours and five
minutes that it takes to watch the film, you can probably make a
significant dent into the novel, and it'll probably cost the same.
Unless you buy popcorn at the theater, that would make the movie more
expensive.

SHINE ON! -- A look at director Scott Hicks' next project - SNOW FALLING
ON CEDARS
An interview by Athan Bezaitis for Filmcritic.com Copyright Athan
Bezaitis 1999
Director Scott Hicks is uncompromising in his approach to filmmaking.
During pre-production for his first feature he insisted that Geoffrey
Rush, at the time a struggling Australian theatre actor, was the only
one who could play the role of pianist David Helfgott.  Hicks would not
be satisfied until he had the right man, and his mulishness proved to be
brilliant insight when SHINE became a resounding hit at the 1996
Sundance Film Festival.  It went on to receive seven Academy Award
nominations including the best actor award for Rush and a nomination for
Hicks as best director.
In the wake of SHINE's dazzling success, Hicks was inundated with
hundreds of screenplays and offers to direct, but nothing caught his
eye.  But he had read David Guterson's incredibly popular novel Snow
Falling On Cedars and felt compelled to tell its fascinating story, but
was disappointed to learn that the rights had already been purchased by
a major studio.  Eventually word got out about Hicks' interest, and when
the screenplay made its way to his home in Australia, he jumped at the
offer.  As both director and devout fan of the book, his vision of SNOW
FALLING CEDARS was to recreate more than just the plot of the deep and
powerful novel.  He wanted the moviegoer's experience to have the same
feel of absorption as actually reading the book.
Faced with the arduous task of adapting such a complex novel into film,
plus having to measure up to all the expectations created by his first
film, Scott Hicks has reached a crossroads in his career.  Will his
second film vault him into elite status among the finest directors, or
will it set him back, raising questions of whether or not he's a `one
hit wonder'?  Hicks confronted these daunting issues and more as I spoke
with him after a private screening.
filmcritic.com: Your debut film SHINE is almost universally loved and
accepted.  It resurrected David Helfgott's career.  It also transformed
you from documentaries to a major player in the world of full-length
feature film.  No matter how good SNOW FALLNG ON CEDARS turns out to be,
do you feel any added pressure for this film to succeed because of your
success with SHINE?
Scott Hicks: Nothing is ever going to be the same again.  SHINE was a
unique experience and very few people are ever lucky to feel that degree
of universal acceptance.  After years of really struggling to get
noticed as a filmmaker, the fact that there is anticipation and
expectation attached to this film is a huge relief.  At least I know
that people are going to pay attention.  Whether or not they'll like it
is the really important part.  What SHINE has done is ignite a career
for me.  It has given me the opportunity to make this film, which is
quite different, and hopefully will be just as successful.
filmcritic.com: What first drew you to David Guterson's novel Snow
Falling on Cedars?
Scott Hicks: Reading the novel was such an awe-inspiring experience for
me because it's so densely detailed and atmospheric.  I felt completely
immersed.  It was like entering another world with layer upon layer of
detail that just accumulates and secretes until you realize that you're
completely embedded.  Within that world you have such powerful
characters and this intense human drama.  It is essentially a love story
that is dashed against the epic events that occur which are out of the
character's control.
filmcritic.com: Because the atmosphere affected you so powerfully, is
that why you took ten months of location scouting and why you heavily
collaborated with author David Guterson to create the right setting?
Scott Hicks: I needed to immerse myself in that world and that
environment.  The locations were extremely important.  Not just for the
vistas but because I wanted it to feel like an authentic island setting,
and it was great to have David as a reality check.  I didn't want to
make some silly blunder with something that would make it appear or feel
artificial.
filmcritic.com: When did Robert Richardson (Director of Photography --
PLATOON, WAG THE DOG, and THE HORSE WHISPERER) become involved in the
project?
Scott Hicks: I knew his work from all sorts off films that I'd seen and
I was a huge admirer of his.  When you're choosing people to work with
it's kind of like casting.  It's something Frank Zappa used to do when
he was auditioning musicians.  You take it for granted that they have
the musical credentials, but you need to know whether or not they're
going to have a sense of humor.  Or whether or not you're going to be
able to get along with them?  So I meet Bob and we just hit it off right
away.  He's a very charismatic character so we really connected.  He got
involved a couple of months before shooting.  We sat down and went
through books of still photography and we shared our ideas of the
graphic design, the shape, and feel for the film.
filmcritic.com: Was there any specific photographer whose pictures you
used in collaboration?
Scott Hicks: Harry Callahan and Robert Frank both had important and
unique details in their photographs that we felt we could use because
they best represented the era of 1950's and the setting, which is a
small fictional island off the coast of Puget Sound.  In designing some
of the sets I would say, "Where's the Callahan moment we can use here?"
filmcritic.com: That amazing opening scene that appears to be shot under
one key light source, just a lantern being held up by a fisherman.  How
did you go about choosing that unique approach?
Scott Hicks: There was a lot of elaborate preparation in creating it
like that and interestingly it was the very first shot of the film,
which is quite rare.  We decided that it was a great way to suck the
audience in. That's the whole idea about wanting to immerse people.
Just like in the book.  The introduction allowed me to set the overall
tone that the movie is more about atmosphere than it is about plot.
This is not a whodunit.  The details of the trial and whose blood was on
the railing of the boat is not the point.  It's more about what is
happening between these people and how it will be resolved.  Which is
why I took the attitude that this is not a courtroom drama.  The
courtroom is simply a crucible within which, everyone is confronting his
or her memory.  That's why the film is constructed as an attempt to
simulate how one's mind works.  It constantly flashes from one thought
to the next, which is a more humanistic way of thinking for it allows us
to ponder the future, dwell in the past, or even contemplate a dream
world.
filmcritic.com: When did that structure of having the movie revolve
around memory and flashbacks come about?  Was that the plan from the
start or did it come about gradually?
Scott Hicks: What I didn't want to do was have this dry formulaic flick
where you have three stories in which you did a little bit of one and
then a bit of another.  With such a conventional approach you can lose
people, as they tend to prefer one specific part of the story.  I
decided that we had to shatter it.  When we were editing I got myself an
editor (Hank Corwin -- JFK, NIXON, and NATURAL BORN KILLERS) that was
well equipped to do it and he worked through all the material with me.
We started from the way it was scripted and shot and then we pushed it
to the limit.  I took some bold decisions with the cinematographer and
bold decisions with the editor and composer.  My attitude was, "Let's go
for it!"
filmcritic.com: SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS has quite an eclectic cast from
Sam Shepard to Max Von Sydow, who really stands out in his role as
defense attorney.  Could you explain a little more about your casting
process and how you went about getting such a wide variety of actors for
this movie?
Scott Hicks: That's such a huge part of my job.  First comes casting and
second I need to assure that the whole ensemble is acting in the same
movie! Everybody brings their own methods to the game and unless you're
very careful you'll find that they're off on wild tangents from each
other.  One of the delights with the success of SHINE was that actors
saw me as a director that would pay them a lot of attention because in
Hollywood the performer is often the last person to get any
consideration in formulating the film.
filmcritic.com: You seem to have the virtue of being able to communicate
your work so well with actors.  What kind of preparation do you do with
these actors to coax such impressive performances out of them?
Scott Hicks: A lot of it goes back to casting.  You bring an actor into
the whole process based upon what they are capable of doing and then you
develop an individual relationship with him or her.  Part of my strategy
is that I don't like to rehearse a great deal.  I like to talk through
everything with the actor.  I want to essentially learn from them a
sense of what they want to do.  It's a very delicate balance and you
have to carefully gauge when to interfere and when to stay the hell out
of it and let the carpet unfold.  I'm very much in tune with my actors.
>From elderly actors to children the most important part is to get what
you want out of them and the most successful medium usually arrives when
we both are happy.
filmcritic.com: You got a great performance from Max Von Sydow.  His
role seems to be the one that radiates most throughout the film.  How
did you approach working with him?
Scott Hicks: Max wrote me a beautiful letter after the film was
finished, which I now treasure.  When I was working with him he asked
me, "How do you get things so quiet on the set?"  Because I tend to talk
very quietly and I told my assistant that I wanted no radios, cell
phones, or megaphones.  Everybody had to be quiet because I wanted to
create an atmosphere that just lets the actors do what it is they had to
do. Normally there's a hubbub of activity leading up to every scene and
then suddenly there's silence and "action!"  All at once the actor is
forced to get out of the gate and do their thing.  I like them to feel
that there's a certain quiet atmosphere in which they can think without
distractions.  That's pretty much what I did for Max.  I created an
environment so that he could best do what he's equipped to do.  I mean
here's an actor supreme and all I did was help with subtle nuances and
made tiny suggestions.  His letter just thanked me for making the role
so perfectly suited for his strengths.
filmcritic.com: Since you've done a lot of documentary films in the
past, has that made an impact on your overall approach to narrative
film?
Scott Hicks: It's had a lot of impact.  It's made me much more confident
in relying on my instincts in capturing what I've set in motion.  You
have to create the scenario.  It really started with Geofferey Rush on
SHINE although there's no improvisation in Geoffrey's performance, every
syllable that he utters is in the script is written on the page, but the
challenge for me was to help him find the identity of the character,
create the situation, and let him go.  We would then film it as though
it was never going to happen again.  Now that's like documentary where
you don't get a second chance.  You've got to catch it and you've got to
look for the detail that you're going to piece together to tell that
story.  You can't just set a camera there and let everybody just parade
in front of it and hope that the audience is going to make sense of it.
You're still telling a story.  Everything from those "Callahan moments"
to the color of a woman's lips, to the shaking of Max Von Sydow's hands
is relevant.
filmcritic.com: Going back to when you first read the novel.  As a
filmmaker, do you envision certain actors like Ethan Hawke or Sam
Shepard in your mind as you read the story?
Scott Hicks: Not when I first started reading the book but when I got
the screenplay and began working on the script certain faces started to
come into my mind and Sam Shepard was one of those characters that could
portray Ishmael's (Ethan Hawke) father.  He's very selective in the
roles that he chooses.  He's only made eight movies in his whole career
and his film credits are staggering.  I thought that there wasn't a
chance in hell that he'd want to do this movie with me, but when I asked
he was thrilled.
filmcritic.com: This novel was so popular.  Obviously adapting novels is
not easy, but some of the greatest films ever have been adaptations from
books like LOLITA and PATH OF GLORY.  Was it a difficult adaptation
because of the complexity of the book and do you think its readers will
be happy with the movie?
Scott Hicks: I was determined that I would not betray the reader.  That
doesn't mean that I was going to be slavishly faithful to the novelist
but I felt that this book was not about plot rather than atmosphere and
emotion.  Those were the essential ingredients that I want to keep in
the same faith with the novel and where a lot of adaptations stumble is
how they boil the novel down to just the plot line and only try and tell
element of the story.  In that case, a plot is often feeble and
evaporates right in front of your eyes.  It doesn't resemble the
experience of reading the book so I wanted SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS to be
a cinematic version of reading the book.  The film is a total immersion
of sight and sound where it's all coming at you at once until that
climactic point when you see the whole fragmented film pieced together.
The greatest test for me was asking the author David Guterson himself.
When I first showed it to him I was nervous with trepidation and when he
saw it, he embraced me and said, `There's not one thing about that film
that could have been better.'  I was ecstatic.
filmcritic.com: You almost didn't become a filmmaker until you met some
longhaired philosopher who changed your life.  What was that all about?
Scott Hicks: I was going to study law at Adelaide University in
Australia and was all signed up.  I'd been enrolled and accepted and
then I went to go see a musical `VietRock" and at the end of it they
said there would be a discussion that would be chaired by a philosophy
professor from a new university that had been established a few years
earlier.  I thought it would be some boring old fart that would just
talk my ears off when all of the sudden this guy came down the aisle in
his mid fifties with long hair and denims and I thought he looked pretty
cool.  Strangely enough, he looks sort of like I do now.  I decided to
stay and watch him speak and afterwards went to visit the university.  I
found it extremely interesting and decided to enroll there but I wanted
to do English and History.  They said I couldn't mix disciplines with
major subjects so I had to choose something else.  So I decided to do
English and a much easier subject in drama, which would act as adjunct
to English.  It ended up changing my life.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     Several months ago, upon hearing that David Guterson's much-respected
novel _Snow Falling on Cedars_ was being turned into a film, I made my
usual effort to familiarize myself with the source material. After
approximately 90 pages, I did something I almost never do: I surrendered. 
The grinding pacing of the story -- which, at the point I lost interest,
had consisted almost entirely of a court proceeding -- did absolutely
nothing to motivate persistence. Whatever intriguing themes might have
been contained in Guterson's tale would never be known to me thanks to a
narrative decision I considered crippling: waiting far too long to get to
the point.
     This background is offered to make it clear that my ambivalence
towards Scott Hicks' SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS has nothing to do with
affection for the source material. It also sets up the problem with the
film, which is the same problem I had with the novel. The story begins in
1950, in a fishing village on an island off the coast of Washington state.
A murder trial is beginning, in which Japanese-American fisherman Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is accused of killing another fisherman with whom
there was a history of family dispute. Reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan
Hawke) is covering the trial, but his interest is more than merely
journalistic. In flashback, we learn of Ishmael's youthful romance with
Hatsue (Youki Kudo), who will become Kazuo's wife. Their love affair is
thrown into turmoil, by the "relocation" of Japanese-Americans during
World War II, an act of discrimination the implications of which carry
into Kazuo's trial.
     It's not the first time the screen has seen a story of lovers
separated by the Japanese-American internment camps (Alan Parker fumbled
the similarly-themed COME SEE THE PARADISE), but that doesn't mean it's
not an important story to tell. In fact, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS has an
angle on the often-didactic issue of racism that makes it potentially
compelling. Ishmael faces a moral choice when he discovers information
that could exonerate Kazuo, a choice complicated by his own feelings of
hatred. Those feelings, however, are not some easily dismissable bigotry.
Instead, they're a churning mixture of Ishmael's tangled feelings about
his father (Sam Shepard), a controversial liberal publisher; about the
loss of an arm in the war; and about his lingering obsession/revulsion
towards Hatsue. While the prosecutor in Kazuo's case (James Rebhorn) 
engages in none-too-subtle race-baiting, Ishmael's own brand of less overt 
racism makes it harder to watch with smug superiority.
     Unfortunately, by the time it's clear how Hicks and co-screenwriter
Ron Bass are trying to personalize the murky matter of racism, the film is
almost over. That leaves a film with two glaring flaws. The first is Ethan
Hawke's performance as Ishmael, which is so blank that the role might just
as easily have been played by a cardboard cutout. Hicks does a nice job
with Ishmael and Hatsue's secretive adolescent trysts inside a hollow
tree, but he doesn't do much to help us understand Ishmael's longing. 
Hawke plays most of his scenes with a thousand-yard stare we're expected
to interpret as a combination of introspection and repressed emotion,
while it could just as easily be interpreted as trying to remember where
he left his car keys. By the time Hicks tries to crank up the drama by
cranking up James Newton Howard's score during a wildly overwrought
sequence involving Hatsue's "Dear John" letter, it's too late to give the
relationship the sense of consequence it demands.
     The second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by
that "Dear John" sequence, which shows up at every possible wrong time. 
There are quiet moments in SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS when the mournfully
personal manages to escape -- Kazuo and Hatsue sharing a wedding night in
the internment camp separated from her family only by a curtain, or the
always-segregated school bus suddenly missing its Japanese-American
passengers. Too often, however, Hicks either ladles on the symbolism
(Hatsue in a convoy to the internment camps reminiscent of her parade as
the town's "Strawberry Princess") or lets speeches tell his story (fixing
on a close-up of Max von Sydow as Kazuo's defense attorney, summing up for
the jury how "humanity itself is on trial"). There's too much film-making
business going on for too long, and too little of the human story that
should intensify the historical story. I didn't surrender on the film
version of SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS. I merely walked out unsatisfied,
wondering why the story, like bad journalism, had to bury the lead.

_Snow_Falling_on_Cedars_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Ethan Hawke may topline the credits of this adaptation of David Guterson's
highly-esteemed novel, but neither he nor anyone else in the cast can lay
claim to being the "star" of the film.  That title belongs to
director/co-scripter (with Ron Bass) Scott Hicks, who has crafted a lushly
evocative mood piece that has everything to do with sense and emotion as it
doesn't with traditional plot-driven satisfactions.
Of course, there is a story here, and the primary one revolves around the
1950 trial of Japanese-American Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), who is charged
with murder.  Kazuo is married to Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), whose heart truly
belongs to the caucasian Ishmael Chambers (Hawke), who runs the local
newspaper in the Pacific Northwest community of San Piedro.  They have been
in love ever since they were children, but anti-Japanese sentiment during
the WWII-era--culminating in her family's incarceration in the internment
camp of Manzanar--tore them apart.
There are more secondary character touches, such as Ishmael's struggle with
living up to his father's (Sam Shepard) legacy as a newspaperman, but all of
the narrative comes secondary to the depth of feeling Hicks, cinematographer
Robert Richardson, and composer James Newton Howard are able to convey
through imagery.  For a two-hour-plus film, _Snow_ is startlingly short on
dialogue, relying on sight and sound to tell the story for extended
passages.  It's said that a picture says a thousand words, and the images in
the film speak a lot more about the emotion of the piece than any scripted
lines.  This is best exemplified by the central Ishmael-Hatsue romance;
Hawke and Kudoh barely share any screen time, but one can feel the longing
between them to the point of heartache.  The story eventually catches up and
converges with the atmosphere in the end, making for the perfectly
transcendent conclusion to this beautiful work of art.

SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a silent movie.  Well, not exactly, but
director Scott Hicks (SHINE) does rely chiefly on tableaux to tell the
story, which is based on David Guterson's well-respected novel.
This isn't quite as hopeless as it might seem, since Robert Richardson's
breathtaking cinematography of the Pacific Northwest during the snowiest
winter in decades is nothing short of astounding.  Couple this with
gorgeous settings and richly evocative music, and you've got a movie
that's a real treat for the eyes and the ears.  Your mind, however, will
not be equally engaged.
Cutting back and forth in time and locale, Hicks only confuses the
viewers.  One time we witness 10-year-olds having sex only to realize
that Hicks has tricked us again.  The people inside the dimly lit cedar
tree are now closer to the age of consent than 10.  Another time, we
witness hand-to-hand combat on American shores only to find that it's
Germany instead.  If these visual slights of hand served some purpose it
might be different, but they don't.
At the center of the story is a fascinating trial.  Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick
Yune), a Japanese-American who fought just a half-decade earlier in the
trenches of World War II, is on trial for the murder of a local
fisherman, who died recently under what appear to be mysterious
circumstances.  Since Kazuo was the last person at the crime scene, he
is accused of the murder.  In a xenophobic town in which
European-Americans distrust Japanese-Americans, and vice-versa, Kazuo is
immediately assumed guilty by most of those not of Japanese ancestry.
One man who does eventually come to Kazuo's aid is the local
newspaperman, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), since he and Kazuo's wife,
Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Kudoh), were long-time childhood sweethearts.
Hawke (BEFORE SUNRISE), who is an accomplished actor, isn't able to do
anything with his part in this picture because of the restrictions
placed upon him by the director.  Hicks strategically places Ishmael in
each scene and then has him look as stoic as possible while saying
absolutely nothing.  Stone statues have more warmth.
Although the trial sequences are mesmerizing, Hicks uses them only as a
glue to hold the rest of the story together.  The script by Hicks and
Ronald Bass devotes most of the movie to the long background material on
the years before the trial.  As we spend long minutes observing native
flora, the movie takes on the same remote and dispassionate feel found
in THE THIN RED LINE.  Whenever the trial starts to build a little
momentum, Hicks cuts back to the past so that young Ishmael and Hatsue
can stroll along the beach some more.
The star of the trial is the wise, but aging, defense attorney, Nels
Gudmundsson played with panache by Max von Sydow.  Nels's hands shake,
he has trouble remembering his questions, but he puts his heart and soul
into the case.  Whether it will be enough to save his client is,
nonetheless, questionable.
Paced faster and with much of the extraneous material pruned back, SNOW
FALLING ON CEDARS could have been an outstanding motion picture instead
of merely a handsome one.  Posturing as an art form works for painters,
but the technique isn't suitable for an action medium.  Hicks should
have given Hawke some meaningful lines and let him out of his
straightjacket.  Together they could have fashioned something wonderful.
SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS runs a long 2:06.  It is rated PG-13 for
disturbing images, sensuality and brief strong language and would be
fine for teenagers.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Director Scott Hicks' visually stunning follow-up to the Oscar-nominated
Shine appears, on its surface, to be a simple murder mystery.  Instead,
Snow Falling on Cedars is an intricate tale of forbidden love, humanity,
integrity and decency.  Based on the best-selling novel by David
Guterson, Cedars is hauntingly beautiful, using long takes and close-ups
that show the story more than telling it.
Set in 1954 San Piedro, a tiny fishing village north of the Puget Sound,
Cedars opens aboard a ship on a particularly foggy evening.  The
fisherman, a meticulous, by-the-book sailor, is found the next morning
washed up in his own fishing net and with multiple stab wounds.  His
accused killer is Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a young man born in
America but of Japanese descent.  The murder and incarceration of Kazuo
reawakens both the prejudices of the small town's white population, with
Pearl Harbor still fresh in their minds, as well as reminding those of
Japanese ancestry of their imprisonment in internment camps the previous
decade.
Cedars' story concentrates on the aftermath of the death and subsequent
trial, which are some of the finest courtroom scenes ever filmed.  But
the strength of the film is its unusual narrative structure, offering
numerous flashbacks to several different periods in the history of the
town.  Some are directly related to the trial, while the majority of
these flashbacks concentrate on the childhood relationship between
Kazuo's wife Hatsue (Youki Kudoh, Mystery Train) and the son of the
town's newspaper owner, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke, The Newton Boys).
Playmates as children, Hatsue and Ishmael grew closer and closer as the
years passed.  Knowing that she was forbidden to date white boys, the
two are forced to relegate their burgeoning passion to a hollowed-out
cedar tree in the woods near each of their homes.  But World War II
interrupts their already delicate bond; Hatsue and her family are
dragged off to an internment camp, while Ishmael is sent to fight for
his country.  Without divulging too much of the plot, Ishmael learns
that Hatsue has called off their relationship while he is overseas, and
the resulting scene still gives me chills when I think about it.
In the present day, Ishmael, who has inherited the Island Review from
his deceased father, recognizes the importance of the trial as it
relates to the future of his town.  Together with Kazuo's defense
attorney Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow, What Dreams May Come), Ishmael
sets out to prove Kazuo's innocence, despite both the bigotry of the
majority of his advertisers and subscribers and the bitterness he feels
toward Kazuo for stealing the heart of the girl that he still loves.
It's tough to pick a place to begin praising the hypnotic and
atmospheric Cedars.  The film is jaw-in-your-lap beautiful, from the
silvery-black look to the steely water at the film's beginning, to the
vibrant red strawberry patches that Ishmael and Hatsue played in as
children, to the blinding white blizzard that engulfs the town during
the final stretch of the trial, to the darkness that hangs over the
candlelit courtroom as a result of the blizzard's disruption of the
building's power.  This is definitely Oscar-worthy work from one of last
year's nominees, Robert Richardson (The Horse Whisperer).
Pleasantville's art and production teams help give the film a rich,
realistic look and feel.  Editor Hank Corwin (Natural Born Killers)
pieces together the past and the future magnificently and without
seeming like a Lone Star rip-off (unlike Simpatico).  Of the
behind-the-scenes work, only the score (James Newton Howard, The Sixth
Sense) is slightly annoying.
It's very hard to imagine Ethan Hawke carrying a picture, and he doesn't
here.  It's a great role for him because he has few lines, required
mostly to look good and thoughtful instead.  James Cromwell (The Green
Mile) is typically wonderful as the presiding judge, but von Sydow
steals the show with his closing argument that all but flashes `For Your
Consideration' at the bottom of the screen.  His character seems
bewildered and frail, but he is still obviously a legal menace, capable
of swaying any jury.
Hicks, who adapted Guterson's novel with Ron Bass (Stepmom), should be
praised if not just for assembling the talent necessary to pull the film
off.  His direction is first-rate, repeatedly using long stretches with
no dialogue (especially as the Japanese are taken from their homes to
the internment camps), and his World War II scene is nearly as
devastating as Saving Private Ryan's Normandy invasion.  Hopefully Hicks
and his crew will be remembered when it's time to hand out nominations,
if not awards.
2:06 - PG-13 for disturbing war images, adult situations, strong
language and some sexual content

        For a big-budget studio film, there are a lot of art house
pretensions in Scott Hicks' "Snow Falling on Cedars."  Artistic shots of
young lovers catching raindrops on their tongues in the bowels of a tree,
or making out behind dimpled glass.  A non-linear narrative structure so
complex that you could be excused for thinking the lead character (played
by Ethan Hawke) actually stumbles across himself washed up on a beach, many
years older and ravaged by war.  An intricate, distracting soundtrack abuzz
with overlapping dialogue, babies wailing, wind and rain beating down on an
old creaky courthouse, all set to strings that swell and swell some more.
        Fans of David Guterson's best-selling novel will probably wish that
Hicks, the director of "Shine," would just shut up and get on with the
story.
        That story is a post-World War II courtroom drama cum love story
set in the high country of Washington state where the cedars touch the sky
and everything is blue and gray (except for the occasional red of the
women's lipstick).  The courtroom drama results from the death of a local
fisherman and the accusation of a Japanese landowner for his murder.  The
love story is one from the past: how a local reporter named Ishmael
Chambers (Hawke) once loved the accused man's wife (Youki Kudoh).  This all
transpires in a time and a place when anti-Japanese sentiment was at its
zenith.
        Earnest, handsomely mounted, and empty, "Snow Falling on Cedars"
takes a difficult chapter in this nation's history--how the United States
interred thousands of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps following
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor--and forsakes a lot of hard questions in the
process.  Max von Sydow's defense attorney does, however, deliver a darned
good closing argument as this two-hour film draws to a close.  Hicks knows
it, and doesn't cut or pull back for a second.
        It's a rare moment of truth in a film that exploits its cinematic
strengths--exquisite photography, manipulative music, and a fractured
narrative style--at the expense of honest storytelling.  Von Sydow is
magnificent in this scene.  Magnificence, alas, is a quality that "Snow
Falling on Cedars" strives, yet fails, to achieve.

         With its lush imagery and muted colors, "Snow Falling on
Cedars" is a first-rate example of a feature film that should have been
a coffee table book instead. Apparently, director Scott Hicks ("Shine")
was so intent on getting the perfect shot of a drop of water sliding off
a fern or in finding bicycle bells that perfectly corresponded to the
sound of Japanese wind chimes he overlooked the fact that most people
who buy tickets to a movie are looking for a story, preferably something
with a little action, romance or humor. Those ingredients are in short
supply in "Snow," but if you want to see how lovingly an amputated arm
can be photographed, by all means, step right up.
 Hicks' self-conscious style is crippling to a story which
depends on passion and mystery to hold an audience's attention. Set in
Washington state in 1950, when much of the country was still grappling
with anti-Japanese sentiments left over from WWII, "Snow" follows the
trial of Kazou Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a fisherman accused of murdering an
American. Covering the court proceedings is reporter Ishmael (Ethan
Hawke), whose real interest lies in Miyamoto's wife Hatsue (Youki
Koduh).
 Hatsue and Ishmael were childhood sweethearts before the war
but were ultimately torn apart by Japanese traditions and her family's
exile to the Manzanar internment camp. The two barely found time to make
love in a hollowed-out cedar (and you thought back seats were bad!)
before their separation. Nine years later, Ishmael is still nursing his
broken heart.
 In its supporting roles, "Snow" employs several reliable
character actors -- James Cromwell, James Rebhorn, Richard Jenkins --
but it seems Hicks' only direction to them was to look as morose as
possible. Hawke, too, is such a Gloomy Gus he's extremely difficult to
identify with and both Ishmael and Hatsue's characters are so sketchy we
never get a sense of any bond between them, aside from the tryst in the
tree perhaps.
 The movie proceeds at a lethargic pace as Hicks stacks his
visuals one on top of another, smothering them in echoing dialogue and
an elegiac score by James Newton Howard, all of which keeps us even
further away from any developing drama. Any genuine emotion seems to
have been drained out in the name of art. Even when the camera glides
past scores of soldiers' bodies washed up on the beach at Normandy, the
movie remains so aloof, you might think you're looking at part of a new
campaign for Calvin Klein's Obsession. Like snow itself, the movie is
picturesque but chilly -- and a chore to plow through. James Sanford
