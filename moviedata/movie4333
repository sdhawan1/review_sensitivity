Heard any good stories lately?  Think any of them are true?
Jon Shear's edgy thriller, URBANIA, loves to mess with our minds, and it 
has lots of stories to tell us.  Set on a night with a built-in extra 
hour due to the Daylight Savings Time shift, the episodic story has 
characters who relate incidents with varying degrees of believability.  
The reaction of the characters hearing the stories frequently reveals 
more about them than about the teller.  Sometimes nervous laughter will 
be followed by painful introspection.  
The disorienting film takes devious delight in layering various versions 
of the stories so that we feel like we're jurors looking into a 
courtroom lined with funhouse mirrors.  What are we supposed to believe?  
One thing certain in this intriguing and distorting tale is that our 
eyes are glued to the screen.  The wonderfully labyrinthic script by 
Daniel Reitz and Jon Shear is based on Reitz's play "Urban Folk Tales."  
In a terrific, nuanced performance, Dan Futterman (THE BIRDCAGE) plays 
the story's protagonist, a gay man named Charlie, who is searching for 
his Mr. Right, Dean (Samuel Ball).  When Charlie first laid eyes on 
Dean, a hunk with a heart and snake tattoo, Charlie decided that Dean 
was the man for him.  Among the many questions is whether Dean, who 
appears to be a potentially violent homophobe, is what he seems to be.
Along the way this eventful night, Charlie encounters people gay and 
straight who have their stories to tell, most of which we see acted out.  
One story, about a woman with a wet poodle and a microwave, is thrown in 
as the story's only real joke.  The script is especially good at not 
telegraphing which stories have legs and which end almost before they 
begin.  One of the latter involves an attractive middle-aged woman who 
propositions a bartender with a purse full of fifties.  Even the most 
minor of these incidents are staged with such creepy class that they 
become quite intriguing.
It's the sort of film in which even innocuous phrases such as, "Don't 
forget to set your clock back," manage to have dark, ominous portents.  
The crisp editing by Randolph Bricker and Ed Marx keeps us on our toes 
as images sometimes flash by like a hit-and-run and others times linger 
to haunt us.  And Shane Kelly's cinematography captures the mood almost 
too well.  Nightmares after this film are definitely possible, not so 
much for what happens as for the movie's raw intensity.
"Just give me a second to figure out the ending," Charlie tells us at 
the opening of the movie.  The biggest disappointment for me was that 
URBANIA doesn't really have an ending.  Oh well, as they say, "the 
journey is the reward."  And for adventuresome moviegoers, URBANIA takes 
us through a fascinating night when danger is definitely in the air.
URBANIA runs a little long at 1:43.  It is rated R for strong violent 
and sexual content, language and some drug use.  It would be acceptable 
for college students and older.

 Director: Jon Shear
 Writer: Jon Shear, Daniel Reitz, play "Urban Folk Tales" by
Daniel Reitz
 Cast: Dan Futterman, Alan Cumming, Matt Keeslar, Josh
Hamilton, Lathaire Bluteau, Bill Sage, Barbara Sukowa, Paige
Turco, Megan Dods, Gabriel Olds, Samuel Ball
  The thirty-seven year old Dan Futterman, who is known
principally to audiences that favor indie films like "Shooting
Fish," has the look and smirk of a young Ben Gazzara.  He
appears in every scene of Jon Shear's adaptation of Daniel
Reitz's play "Urban Folk Tales," a surreal, nihilistic journey
into the netherworld of Manhattan's dark streets.  Mixing
flashbacks with intentionally comic and quick scenes from
urban legends (such as the woman who microwaves her
poodle to prevent its catching a cold and the man who wakes
up in an ice-cold bath minus a kidney), "Urbania" is the story
of a traumatic incident in a young man's life and the
redemption he ultimately gains.  Shane Kelly's Super 16 film
gives this mysterious, sometimes opaque but always
challenging tale the obligatory grainy look of a noir yarn while
Marc Anthony Thompson's editing flashes back and forth
from reality to imagination furiously, adding to the intensity of
the central character's passion.  
   As Charlie (Dan Futterman) walks the streets of downtown
Manhattan we recall Robert De Niro's perambulations through
the hazy metropolitan byways, steam pouring from the
sewers.  Charlie's world is hopefully unlike any we have
seen.  The man is filled with a simmering rage resulting from
an incident about which we gain a brief hint early on, as he
recalls the pleas of a bloodied dying person, the victim of a
homophobic beating.  Though Shear keeps us wondering how
the pieces fit, we soon discover that Charlie's companion
Chris (Matt Keeslar) is the unhappy victim of a hate crime
and that Charlie is intent on restoring his peace of mind while
at the same time he combs the area looking for distractions.
   As he wanders about the town, through hidden tunnels and
a neighborhood bar like a landlubbing ancient mariner, he
runs into a number of people, each with a story to tell.  Some
are old friends, such as Brett (Alan Cumming), a friend
whose sensuous eyes reveal the ardor he feels for the young
man, while a far different sort is a stuttering homeless man,
Bill, (Lothaire Bluteau), whom Charlie treats compassionately
as though he were chatting with a pet.  
   After allowing us to eavesdrop into a host of stories by
diverse people including a friendly bartender, a ditzy blonde
who has established a relationship with a man Charlie knows,
Shear gets down to business in the final segment as the film
turns raw and pungent.  Charlie ultimately meets and toys
with the man whom he believes responsible for his torment
and, after meting out justice has a final reunion with the
object of his passion.
   "Urbania," which was featured at Sundance and later at the
GenArts festival, demands our attention in every scene,
forcing us to suspend not so much our disbelief but our urge
for immediate gratification.  Shear takes his time in putting
the segments of Charlie's trauma together but once done, we
witness the appropriate cathartic touch.  Our patience is
rewarded as we are convinced that this likeable fellow is able
to get wholly in touch with his remorse and to take action to
rehabilitate himself and shuck off the anxiety that wears him
down.
Rated R.  Running Time: 107 minutes.  (C) 2000
