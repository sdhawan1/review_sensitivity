PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
A bored housewife is the focus of this film.  And if that doesn't give
you any indication of the overall boringness of the movie, then read
on.  Diane Lane (Murder at 1600) stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a seemingly
happy wife and mother of two  until the family takes its annual trek
from New York City to Woodbridge for summer vacation.  Here, Pearl
realizes that she missed out on too much of her life by becoming knocked
up at the early age of 17.
So instead of turning to valium like all of the other hausfraus, she
starts screwing the traveling blouse salesman (Viggo Mortensen, A
Perfect Murder) that occasionally pops into the shanty vacation town to
peddle wares to the stranded women.  She doesn't learn his name until
later.  And because the film is set in the summer of 1969, the
filmmakers have Pearl and the Blouse Man make love with the requisite
nostalgic backdrops  Woodstock and the moon landing.
Pearl gives no thought to the fact that her hard-working television
repairman husband (Liev Schreiber, Scream) gave up things in his life,
too.  Or to her kids, Alison and Daniel (Anna Paquin and Bobby
Boriello).  Or to her fortune-telling mother-in-law (Tovah Feldshuh, Law
& Order) who keeps Pearl's affair from her own son.  Or even to the poor
fools that have to watch this film.
The anemic script is blandly directed by Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy in
Ghost) but is more of a showcase for some very fine acting.  The best
parts, however, are actually from an unseen actress  Julie Kavner is
the uncredited voice of the resorts social director that can often be
heard announcing to the yenta vacationers `The knish man is on the
premises.'  (1:45  R for nudity, sex and adult language)

Gray; director of photography, Anthony Richmond; edited by Dana Congdon;
music by Mason Daring; production designer, Dan Leigh; produced by Dustin
Hoffman, Goldwyn, Jay Cohen, Neil Koenigsberg, Lee Gottsegen and Murray
Schisgal; released by Miramax Films.CAST: Diane Lane (Pearl Kantrowitz),
Viggo Mortensen (Walker Jerome), Liev Schreiber (Marty Kantrowitz), Anna
Paquin (Alison Kantrowitz), Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz), Bobby
Boriello (Daniel Kantrowitz), et al. 107 minutes. R  (sex).
A nice movie, even though it is too slow, too long, has overly neat and
predictable developments, and is unsubtle (but then its people are
unsubtle, too).
It's the first directorial effort by actor Tony Goldwyn, the grandson of
the famous Sam Goldwyn who created MGM. It is also the first filmed script
by Pamela Gray. She wrote it as her thesis for the UCLA Film Department,
and the scenario attracted much attention.
The movie (shot in Canada's Laurentians standing in for the Catskills )
centers on Pearl Kantrowitz (Lane), a young and comely mother of two,
Alison (Paquin) 14, and much younger Daniel. Her husband Marty (Schreiber)
is a Brooklyn TV-repairman. The time is the summer of 1969. Marty drives
his family, including his mother Lilian (Feldshuh) to the low-end Jewish
resort of Dr.Fogler's bungalows. Marty, like many other, unretired men, has
to go back to work and gets to the bungalows only on weekends.
Pearl is a pretty woman with a beautiful figure -- often displayed. She is
vaguely dissatisfied with her life.  Married to Marty when she was a
teenager (and pregnant with Alison), she has known no other men (carnally,
that is) and is also aware of the hippie culture of the times, and the
"freedom" that goes with it.
While, at the resort, rather too neatly Alison gets her first period and
her first boyfriend, Pearl meets Walker (Mortensen), aka The Blouse Man. He
is a peddler of women's garments, an itinerant dweller of his bus
shop-plus-home. Pearl has an affair with him. Marty finds out. But there's
a probably (and certainly contrived) happy ending.
AWOTM does a good job in its observation of people, that is, its nucleus of
the five Kantowitzs plus Walker. The other characters are strictly an
uncluttering background, which is good -- even though contemporary
Jewish-American filmmakers (Gentiles would not dare !) including this
picture's, tend to overdo ethnic accents, manners and mannerisms. They add
to them touches of irony (granted this is often warm) that can border on
the tiresome.
However, the Kantowicz family is free of ethnic touches, except for old pro
Tovah Feldshuh who portraysa most original and sweet mother-in-law. All the
people in the film are real, even veristic, which amounts to their being
rather dull, as most terra-firmans are. But the main problem is not there.
It is in the construction.
First come the symbols, metaphors, parallels and improbabilities, starting
with the movie's title. The summer of 69 was the summer of the first man to
walk on the moon (Neil Armstrong on 20 July). While the gathered
bungalow-dwellers watch on TV the liberation of earthlings, and rejoice,
Pearl, inside Walker's bus, goes into sexual orbit and finds her own sexual
liberation. Too pat.
The coincidental mother-and-daughter newfound sexuality? Too pat. Later,
Walker and Pearl cavort and make love under a waterfall, but the camp's
denizens do not notice. Improbable. The Woodstock Rock Festival   (15-17
August), held not at Woodstock but in Bethel , N.Y., is too conveniently
close to  Dr. Fogler's Bungalows. Alison and new boyfriend Ross scoot  over
to the festival where she spots her Ma writhing with abandon with her
lover. Too much. When Pearl takes to the road, in the rain, the itinerant
Walker just happens to be driving by.   Young Daniel gets strung by bees
--at a providential time that triggers his dad's return to the resort. Too
pat. And so on.
I 'll  make an educated guess here. As a film student, script-writer Pamela
Gray must have most certainly seen several classic movies. Her scenario is
under the sign of at least three masterpieces of the 30s and 40s: The Rules
of the Game (France), Casablanca (US), Brief Encounter (UK).
In The Rules of the Game, Renoir went to some careful preparations before
the wife of the host, testing a small monocular, spies her husband
embracing his (now-ex) mistress.  In  AWOTM, Alison, using unexplained
binoculars, spots Pearl and Walker within a crowd of hundreds of thousands!
In Casablanca, Rick parting with Ilsa utters the famous "it doesn't take
much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill
of beans in this crazy world."  He is right, but such is the power of that
movie that, paradoxically, those problems do affect the audience. Which is
not the case in AWOTM, where, as in many more movies, private or domestic
problems affect the characters but not the public. Such  movies do not go
beyond their own borders.
Brief Encounter is a masterpiece among films in general and love stories in
particular. The short-lived affair, with no sex, between married Celia
Johnson and Trevor Howard is so achingly beautiful that it can haunt you
for years. What is important for the characters is certainly not trite for
us.
This said, the principals' performances are very good. For Diane Lane, Liev
Schreiber and to an extent, Anna Paquin, their roles are difficult yet
deliver the goods with great conviction. Lane's debut was as a ravishing
teen-ager in A Little Romance (1979). She made a lovely Paulette Goddard in
Chaplin (1992), but her career has had few memorable roles. Her Pearl feels
like a comeback.

A WALK ON THE MOON (director:Tony Goldwyn; screenwriter: Pamela Gray;
cinematographer: Anthony Richmond; cast: Diane Lane (Pearl Kantrowitz),
Viggo Mortensen (Walker Jerome), Liev Schreiber (Marty Kantrowitz), Anna
Paquin (Alison Kantrowitz), Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz), Bobby
Boriello (Daniel Kantrowitz), Joseph Perrino (Ross, the lifeguard),
1999)
A heart-rendering film capably directed by the actor now turned
first-time director, Tony Goldwyn, for and about the baby boom
generation, taking place in upstate New York, where a lower middle class
couple annually rent a bungalow for the summer in a Jewish resort and
react to all the change that is in the air for the country and for them
in the summer of '69. It was the summer of the Vietnam War protests,
Neil Armstrong's walk on
the moon, and Woodstock, so the music in the background is appropriately
enough from Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Grateful Dead, Richie Havens,
Dylan, and Hendrix, and so on, which should bring on a case of nostalgia
for those who were around during that period. There should also be some
nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation
spots, for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when
growing up or raising a family.
like the other couples heading for their summer oasis, the featured
couple like to keep time how long it takes them to get from the city by
car to their Catskill Mountain lodgings, with the Red Apple being the
famous rest stop on the thru-way and the half-way point in their
commute. Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) is the restless housewife asking
her steadfast television repairman husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), "Why
do we do the same thing every summer?" His unsatisfactory response to
her is, "Because we do." The eldest child, the 14-year-old Alison (Anna
Paquin), seen wearing a peace medallion around her neck and is also seen
rebelling against her parents lack of idealogy, while her younger
brother, Danny (Boriello), is dressed in a cowboy hat and is just an
innocent kid. The housewife's mother-in-law, the perceptive Lilian
(Tovah Feldshuh), who is a visionary and is very close with her son,
especially so, after her husband just took off and left her one day, and
her son swore he would look out for her from here on. She feels sorry
that her son who dreamed of being a scientist but went to work as a
television repairman, as the easiest way to support his wife, had to
give up his childhood dream.
The Kantrowitz's met when she was a teenager and he was a waiter in a
resort hotel, and the first time they made love the 17-year-old virgin
became pregnant with Alison, which led to their marriage, something the
husband says is the best thing that has happened to him, even if that
marriage led to his not becoming a college graduate but a television
repairman. She now feels that she can't communicate her feelings to her
husband, that life has past her by. She complains to him that the most
important decision that she has to do as a housewife is to choose
whether to shop in the A&P or at Waldbaums. His response is that the
Ring-Dings are fresher at the A&P.
The bungalow colony is a place where everyone knows everyone else's
business, where the men work in the city during the week and come up for
the weekend. It is a place where visitors such as the knish man, is
announced so that the colony will know that he is on the premises. One
of the visitors to the bungalow colony is the handsome blouse man,
Walker Jerome (Viggo), a free-spirited hippie type, peddling his wares
from colony to colony, who bought out the regular blouse man's truck and
route. Tempted by what seems to be the greener grass on the other side
of the fence, Pearl has an affair with the gentle and laidback hippie on
the night of the walk on the moon and is seen by her daughter with him
while attending the nearby Woodstock concert. The film purposefully
means to mirror the couple's life with the changes that altered the face
of the nation during that period.
The ramifications of her affair becomes common knowledge to the family
and threatens the marriage, a marriage where the husband has done
nothing wrong and is, if anything, too good. Marty goes out of his head
at the thought of her with another man and will go into an
uncontrollable rage, feeling the one thing he was most secure about in
life has been taken away from him, while Pearl wrestles with her sense
of responsibility and with what she really wants to do. Finally, she
decides not to ride off with Walker and live a hippie-style of life, and
the super-straight Marty decides to loosen up a little and get with the
new music coming into vogue.
The story allows mother and daughter to come to terms freely with who
they are, as Alison has her first period and her first boyfriend, and is
exploring who she is just like her mother is currently doing. The
conflict between mother and daughter, reflects on how this particularly
volatile time in American history resulted in a sexual revolution and in
a generational movement of attitude changes, that forced families to
face what was in the air at the time or else wide gaps developed in
family relationships.
The moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved
accordingly by the parties affected, and so what happens in the film's
mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance, as it is
put forth in a way that worked out for the film's sake but might not
have seemed correct for many a viewer, or at least, it was not important
enough to be resolved by the film, even if that clash was supposedly the
whole point of the film.
The acting was convincing, the story had a nice feel to it, and it
followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at
that time. The yearnings for a new kind of freedom and to step away from
the old boredom of other generations was in the air, as a counterculture
was constantly being dangled in front of all types. What the film
lacked, was resolution. The aim of the film was realized as a small step
for a troubled woman feeling the need for passion in her life and
getting it via an affair; but, there were no gigantic aims to be
accomplished after Pearl takes her gigantic leap into the arms of her
hippie lover. I thought that the fleeting affair she had with the
long-haired sculptured Adonis figure, certainly satisfied her sexual
needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted
to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response, which left me
believing that the liaison was the thing here, just like in those
romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read, with nothing more to
tax your mind.

Because of an accidental pregnancy, Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) had to
get married at about the same age as her 14-year-old daughter, Alison,
and Pearl has always resented the loss of her youth and freedom.  "Do
you feel trapped in your life," Pearl asks one of her women friends
rhetorically.  "Oh sure," her friend replies hopelessly.  Alison, played
by Academy Award winner Anna Paquin, is having her own problems, going
through the substantial changes of adolescence, having her first period
one day and her first date the next.
A WALK ON THE MOON, actor Tony Goldwyn's directorial debut, takes place
at a low-budget Jewish resort in the Catskills -- think DIRTY DANCING
but set in cheap cabins and without any dancing.  ("How can you not love
it here -- an army barracks with lawn furniture," the stand up comedian
describes their "resort" during his dinner act.)  The time is the summer
of 1969 and period events like the first walk on the moon and the
Woodstock music festival get prominent placement in the storyline
although the movie has little to do with either one.
The well cast movie is glacially paced as if it were in some sort of
trance.  Except for one completely predictable and brief bit of dramatic
tension that occurs in the middle, the movie drifts along like a sailing
ship lost in a placid sea without any wind to provide momentum.  The
actors, for all of their talent, never seem engaged.  They are as lovely
as models in a magazine but just as two-dimensional.
Pearl's husband (Liev Schreiber) only gets a few days off from his job
as a TV repairman, so he leaves the family (his wife, son, daughter, and
fortunetelling mother) alone in the Catskills while he goes back home to
work.  This provides just the opportunity that Pearl has subconsciously
wanted to have that sexual fling she was denied through an early
marriage.
One day, "The Blouse Man" steps into her life.  Viggo Mortensen, with
his animal magnetism, long flowing hair, and deep, penetrating eyes,
plays a man who drives his old bus from one resort to another, selling
blouses.  After a couple of meetings, they are off having sex, movie
style, under waterfalls as well as in slightly more conventional and
believable places like in his bus.
Since Pearl does a laughably bad job of concealing her affair, she is
quickly discovered, generating the obligatory series of confrontation
scenes.  "I'm the teenager, not you," her daughter scolds her when she
finds out that Mom's been cheating on Dad.  "You had your chance."  "No,
I didn't," Pearl complains.
Since the film is almost devoid of dramatic tension, it could have used
some humor to give it some spark of energy.  The only even barely funny
scene, however, occurs when some hippies decide to skinny dip in the
resort's lake.  This scandalizes the guests, who grab their children and
run away with them lest the kids see some naked bodies.
"It's true," Pearl's husband finally admits.  "I'm a bad listener.  I'm
not a very good talker either."  Regretfully, such insightful lines like
these rarely occur in A WALK ON THE MOON.  Instead, the movie just limps
along until it runs out the clock, having never accomplished anything.
The only memorable parts of the movie are a few good Woodstock songs,
but you probably already know them anyway.
A WALK ON THE MOON runs 1:45 but feels longer.  It is rated R for sex,
nudity, profanity and drug usage and would be fine for older teenagers.

1999 - 106 minutes
Rated R (for profanity, sex, and brief nudity).

"A Walk on the Moon," actor Tony Goldwyn's directing debut, is similar 
in place and time to 1987's far superior "Dirty Dancing." Both are set 
in the nostalgic '60s, during the summer, in the Catskills, and feature 
a female protagonist finally able to come into her own. But while "Dirty 
Dancing" got me involved in the characters and the beautiful setting, "A 
Walk on the Moon" is a smaller, slighter, and less-involving drama.
Set during the crucial summer of '69 when man first walked on the moon 
and the infamous Woodstock took place (both of which are conveniently 
portrayed here), Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) is an unsatisfied 
31-year-old woman who married her high school sweetheart, Marty (Liev 
Schreiber), when she was still a teenager and accidentally got pregnant. 
Despite having certain goals and dreams, Pearl and Marty both decided to 
take responsibility for their actions and be good parents. While on a 
summer-long vacation in the Catskills, Marty, a television repairman, is 
only able to come up on the weekends since there is a mad rush for t.v. 
sets due to the impending moon landing, leaving Pearl; her rebellious 
14-year-old daughter, Alison (Anna Paquin), who is just discovering and 
getting involved in boys; her precocious 5-year-old son; and her 
children's grandmother (Tovah Feldshuh), to fend for themselves during 
the week. By chance, Pearl meets Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), a 
travelling "blouse man" whom, to her utter surprise, she sees as a light 
at the end of a dark tunnel, and starts an affair with, therefore 
putting her marriage and children's trust into jeopardy.
"A Walk on the Moon" is an overall unsatisfying domestic drama that 
feels like it begins in mid-stream, without any proper introduction to 
the characters, and it took me the film's first hour to actually get 
into the story. Even then, with only 45 minutes to go, the characters 
themselves always seemed to be standing at a far distance from me, and 
it was difficult to understand the motives of the central character, 
Pearl. We are supposed to believe that she is taken aback by Walker, but 
he is never written as a fully developed character, but more of a 
symbol, and therefore the whole plotting comes off as a mere contrivance 
in order to give us a story of "self-discovery."
If anything, the performances certainly can't be faulted. Diane Lane, a 
wonderful actress who began a promising career in the early '80s with 
such films as "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish," before resorting to 
low-rent or underused roles, has finally been given her first 
substantially satisfying in recent years. Lane proves a sympathetic 
heroine, even when she is making some very numskull decisions that are 
difficult to understand. In what comes off as one of the few successes 
in an otherwise largely unrealized screenplay, by Pamela Gray, the 
character of Marty is portrayed as not simply the "husband," but a real 
person who is genuinely good, even when considering that he sacrificed 
his own life for his family, and Liev Schreiber is up to every 
challenge. Giving the film's most assured and poignant performance is 
Anna Paquin, already an Academy Award winner (for 1993's "The Piano"), 
and at 16, she has already become one of the best actresses of her 
respective generation. A subplot involving Paquin's character of Alison 
discovering romance for the first time is supposed to come off as a 
catalyst to Pearl's blossoming affair, but not nearly enough time is 
devoted to her. Paquin is given the best scenes, however, including a 
bravura one in which Alison confronts her mother concerning her affair, 
and another in which she has a loving, truthful conversation with her 
father. Viggo Mortensen is the one weak link in the central roles, but I 
suspect this is due to his underwritten role of the "blouse man." There 
is no room given for Mortensen to create a definite personality, and 
director Goldwyn unwisely chooses to add a bunch of pointless sex scenes 
to stand as character development. And the likely winner of best 
performance by an actress in an unseen role goes to Julie Kavner as the 
resort's P.A. announcer, who is constantly announcing things over the 
intercom, including even Alison's first period!
Regardless of the obvious low budget, the film verifiably recreates 
Woodstock in a breathtaking sequence in which, allegedly, 300 people 
were transformed into hundreds of thousands via computer digitization. 
It ends up being an anticlimax, though, and before we are given a chance 
to see it, the film hurriedly moves on to something else.
"A Walk on the Moon" unmistakably feels like a rough cut of a possibly 
good movie. There's a fulfilling one lurking around in there somewhere, 
but the film feels too rushed and, because of this, no emotional 
momentum is allowed to build up. I liked Pearl, and I liked Alison, and 
Marty, but I'd like them even more in a better overall film. Not only 
does the story in "A Walk on the Moon" feel like a plot device, but it 
is also tiresome and unoriginal. So many similar motion pictures have 
been made, and more successfully, that this one only pales in 
comparison. That's too bad, because, even though not alive during the 
decade, I do have a fondness for the '60s.

     A WALK ON THE MOON is a coming-of-age film, which may lead you to
expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation; it's set
during 1969's Summer of Love -- and at Woodstock, no less -- which may
lead you to expect even more "Wonder Years"-esque navel-gazing than usual.
There are some pleasant surprises in A WALK ON THE MOON, actor Tony
Goldwyn's directing debut, but the most pleasant may be that it's mature.
Taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing American
summer, it's a simple, occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to
realize that comings-of-age don't happen exclusively to teenagers.
     In this case, it happens to Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane), a married
Jewish mother of two living in New York City.  The Summer of '69 finds the
Kantrowitzes taking the same vacation to the same Catskills resort where
they vacation every summer, with Pearl's husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), a
television repairman, commuting from the city on weekends.  This summer
seems certain to be something different, however.  Pearl's daughter Alison
(Anna Paquin) is about to "become a woman," and the resort is abuzz with
the anticipation of the impending moon landing.  Most significantly, Pearl
becomes attracted to the resort's itinerant blouse salesman Walker Jerome
(Viggo Mortensen), and begins to wonder how she got so old so fast.
     Pearl's story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time
of social upheaval.  Obliged to surrender her youth when she got pregnant 
as a teenager, Pearl suddenly finds herself compelled to flirt with
youthful irresponsibility when it's a luxury she can no longer afford.
Surprisingly, screenwriter Pamela Gray doesn't celebrate Pearl's affair
with Walker as the action of a woman "finding herself," nor does she turn
Marty (nicely underplayed by Schreiber) into an easy scapegoat.  A WALK ON
THE MOON doesn't shy away from the self-absorption of a wife and mother
falling into the "if it feels good, do it" ethos of the time, embracing
instead the idea of facing one's difficult choices.  Though Gray
occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text (Alison: "You
had your chance to be the kid!"  Pearl: "No, I didn't!"), A WALK ON THE
MOON generally lets Diane Lane's solid performance bring out Pearl's
conflicts.
     Goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his 1960s Catskills milieu
as a distinct, amusing time and place.  The camp's never-seen public
address voice (an unbilled Julie Kavner) makes ubiquitous announcements,
including the onset of Alison's menstrual cycle; women play mah jongg at
outdoor card tables; the men compare boastful tales of how quickly they
managed to make the drive up from the city.  The portrayals do
occasionally drift into the stereotypical, notably Tovah Feldshuh as
Marty's predictably iron-willed, oy-spouting mother, but the characters
still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world.  When
the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the
generation-defining concert -- including a quick skinny-dip in the camp's
private lake -- it provides a well-realized picture of the new freedom
that calls to Pearl.
     The only reason A WALK ON THE MOON feels awkward is that it fumbles
the sub-plot involving Alison's own adventures.  Gray and Goldwyn clearly
want Alison's experimentation to parallel that of her mother, but they
don't dive into Alison's character with nearly enough care.  They take a
half-hearted middle ground when one of the two extremes -- focusing
entirely on Pearl or making the two stories equally significant -- would
have been genuinely effective.  Alison's flirtations and rebellion end up
feeling token, her relationship with her mother never fully explored.
Fortunately, when A WALK ON THE MOON sticks with Pearl's growth --
including getting to know who her husband _really_ is for the first time
-- it's an appealing character study.  From its atmosphere to its acting,
it's a nicely grown-up story of growing up, not just physically but
emotionally.

   When you pass by the doorman in front of that fairly
ordinary building, the security guard in a run-down
department store, the older man who sweeps up inside
McDonald's, does this thought cross your mind..."I wonder
whether this guy always dreamed of becoming a doorman, a
security guard, a sweeper?"  People do have youthful
dreams.  Go into any high school and ask the kids what they
expect to be doing in ten years, and you'll find one student
who is not even on the J.V. basketball team envisioning his
becoming the next Michael Jordan.  Another who hasn't taken
a course more difficult than health ed. is going to become a
neurosurgeon.  
   But as Jessica Lange's character once said, "People in hell
want ice water.  That doesn't mean that they get it."  Most of
us are bound to be thwarted.  It's only natural for our reach to
exceed our grasp.
   This motif of frustrated ambition is an old one: even less
fresh is the theme of adultery.  Yet when the two concepts
combine in Tony Goldwyn's directorial debut film, "A Walk on
the Moon," the story works, largely because of unusually
good casting combined with an engrossing authenticity. 
Those in the audience who have personally lived through the
period described and vacationed in locales similar to the one
portrayed here will feel a gratifying connection to the piece.  
   "A Walk on the Moon," which takes place in the Catskill
Mountains resort area in 1969 (actually filmed in Quebec's
Laurentien Mountains), is a poignant tale of a woman who
became pregnant at age 17, got married too young, and
regrets never having sown her wild oats.  Her husband,
however stymied in his job as a TV repairman because he
did not have the funds to go to college, comes across as
more accepting of his fate.  And therein lies the conflict
between the two.
   The story opens as Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) and her
devoted husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), pack up his mother,
their two kids, and an array of belongings, and head for their
usual summer bungalow resort in the mountains.  As was
typical during this period and in this culture, the husband
would work in the city and come up only for the weekends. 
When Pearl, envious of the sexual and other freedoms that
the youth culture of the late sixties were enjoying, became
attracted to an unconventional blouse salesman named
Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), she indulges herself in an
affair with the young, handsome Gentile man without a
thought of the effect of this liaison on her marriage.
  At times the dialogue is laughably stilted, as when Pearl
tells her incensed husband, "I disappeared.  I wanted to be
the person you fell in love with."  The story flirts with cliche
as when Marty retorts, "Do you think you're the only one who
had dreams that didn't come true?"
   The tale, written by Pamela Gray under a production team
led by Dustin Hoffman, is an old-fashioned one told in the
most conventional, straightforward way. And yet it is more
affecting than quite a number of the so-called hip and edgy
comedies that come out of festivals like Sundance each year.
Director Goldwyn could not have hoped for a better performer
than Liev Schreiber to portray the stereotypical Jewish
husband, perfectly willing to sacrifice his own vacation so that
he could make enough to keep his family upstate, away from
the city heat.  At times Tovah Feldshuh steals the show as
the Bubbie, a visionary who can tell other people's fate from
their tea leaves and who quickly fathoms that her daughter-
in-law is straying.  Anna Pacquin as the 14-year-old daughter
who is experiencing her first period and her first date during
that summer of '69 dishes up a subplot, her own coming of
age paralleling her mom's newfound freedom and ecstasy.
   Goldwyn displays a decent emulation of the Woodstock
Festival of that momentous year, a time in which Neil
Armstrong walked the moon and young, groovy people were
making love, not war, in a way that would infuriate the uptight
elders.  "A Walk on the Moon" is a low-key romantic comedy
with melodramatic undertones--not a momentous film but one
whose superlative cast and accurate portrayal of what we
once did on our summer vacation is altogether pleasing.

1969. The year has been explored numerous times, most notably(to me)
in "The Wonder Years", which is the only T.V. show that I actually
enjoy watching.  In 1969, man landed on the moon, and Woodstock hit
the world like no other musical event had before. Actor Tony(GHOST,
NIXON) Goldwyn's directorial debut, A WALK ON THE MOON, tells the
story of a family whose lives are turned upside down during the summer
of '69 in a Catskills bungalow colony.
Pearl Kantrowitz(Diane Lane) is a Jewish housewife from the city who
seems to be bored with her marriage to straightforward Marty(Liev
Schreiber). She got pregnant at 17 and forfeited her young life to
take care of her two children, Alison(Anna Paquin) and Daniel(Bobby
Boriello). She seems to want to experiment more, to be young again,
and there is no better time than the summer of '69. It is then that
the blouse salesman(Viggo Mortensen) arrives at the bungalow
colony. His name is Walker Jerome, and he is quite the hippie. He
rides around in his bus full of blouses, and soon, the married Pearl
is joining him. Pearl's psychic mother-in-law(Tovah Feldshuh) knows
about her little outings with the blouse man and urges her to stop it
for her family's sake.  Meanwhile, the teenage Alison is coping with
her first boyfriend, and her first period.  She is also going through
an experimental hippie phase, and it is not long before she catches
her mom at Woodstock with the blouse man. Pearl's mother-in-law
finally calls up her son and forces him to get up to the Catskills
immediately to try to fix up the whole mess.
There is nothing especially groundbreaking about the story or the
technique, but the story is told in such down-to-earth fashion that
you can't help feeling intrigued by the coming-of-age of Pearl and
Alison. Mortensen's Walker is never more than a caricature though, and
the story is by-the-numbers, but the film does manage to capture the
whirlwind of turmoil in the Kantrowitz family. Diane Lane is very
good, and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin gives her character as much
life as possible. All in all, Tony(grandson of Samuel) Goldwyn's A
WALK ON THE MOON doesn't offer much insight into the lively 60's, but
it does present us with a nice little slice of life that is sure to
charm most viewers. No matter how much Miramax has sold out, the
company still knows how to put out good movies year-round.

This finely etched family drama is seductively reminiscent of 1969, the year of Vietnam protesters, flower power, Apollo astronauts, Woodstock, and the sexual revolution. But it was just another summer in the Catskills for the Kantrowitz family. Diane Lane plays 31 year-old Pearl Kantrowitz, a loving mother and conscientious kosher housewife, who fears that life is passing her by. She's stranded at Dr. Fogler's Bungalows, an isolated Jewish resort on the borsht belt, with her angst-ridden adolescent daughter, Anna Paquin ("The Piano"), her precocious young son, and their nagging, superstitious, tarot-card reading grandmother (Tovah Feldshuh), while her dull husband (Liev Schreiber) toils in New York as a hard-working TV repairman. The monotony is relieved only by the weekly visit by Viggo Mortensen, as the Blouse Man, a soft-spoken hippie who peddles "bargain" discount fashions from his gypsy van. On one particular weekend - while Neil Armstrong is walking on the moon -!
 Pearl enjoys a liberating, if overheated fling with this seductive, uninhibited proponent of free love and drug experimentation. But then what? Discovery, betrayal, anguish, compassion, forgiveness. Directed by actor Tony Goldwyn, inspired by some of writer Pamela Gray's childhood memories and produced by Dustin Hoffman's company, this film boasts excellent performances set within a strong sense of atmospheric authenticity. And, yes, that's unbilled Julie Kavner's raspy voice on the public address system. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Walk on the Moon" is an amusing, romantic, evocative 8, a sophisticated woman's picture that could appeal to men as well.

Because of an accidental pregnancy, Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) had to 
get married at about the same age as her 14-year-old daughter, Alison, 
and Pearl has always resented the loss of her youth and freedom.  "Do 
you feel trapped in your life," Pearl asks one of her women friends 
rhetorically.  "Oh sure," her friend replies hopelessly.  Alison, played 
by Academy Award winner Anna Paquin, is having her own problems, going 
through the substantial changes of adolescence, having her first period 
one day and her first date the next.  
A WALK ON THE MOON, actor Tony Goldwyn's directorial debut, takes place 
at a low-budget Jewish resort in the Catskills -- think DIRTY DANCING 
but set in cheap cabins and without any dancing.  ("How can you not love 
it here -- an army barracks with lawn furniture," the stand up comedian 
describes their "resort" during his dinner act.)  The time is the summer 
of 1969 and period events like the first walk on the moon and the 
Woodstock music festival get prominent placement in the storyline 
although the movie has little to do with either one.
The well cast movie is glacially paced as if it were in some sort of 
trance.  Except for one completely predictable and brief bit of dramatic 
tension that occurs in the middle, the movie drifts along like a sailing 
ship lost in a placid sea without any wind to provide momentum.  The 
actors, for all of their talent, never seem engaged.  They are as lovely 
as models in a magazine but just as two-dimensional.
Pearl's husband (Liev Schreiber) only gets a few days off from his job 
as a TV repairman, so he leaves the family (his wife, son, daughter, and 
fortunetelling mother) alone in the Catskills while he goes back home to 
work.  This provides just the opportunity that Pearl has subconsciously 
wanted to have that sexual fling she was denied through an early 
marriage.
One day, "The Blouse Man" steps into her life.  Viggo Mortensen, with 
his animal magnetism, long flowing hair, and deep, penetrating eyes, 
plays a man who drives his old bus from one resort to another, selling 
blouses.  After a couple of meetings, they are off having sex, movie 
style, under waterfalls as well as in slightly more conventional and 
believable places like in his bus.
Since Pearl does a laughably bad job of concealing her affair, she is 
quickly discovered, generating the obligatory series of confrontation 
scenes.  "I'm the teenager, not you," her daughter scolds her when she 
finds out that Mom's been cheating on Dad.  "You had your chance."  "No, 
I didn't," Pearl complains.
Since the film is almost devoid of dramatic tension, it could have used 
some humor to give it some spark of energy.  The only even barely funny 
scene, however, occurs when some hippies decide to skinny dip in the 
resort's lake.  This scandalizes the guests, who grab their children and 
run away with them lest the kids see some naked bodies.
"It's true," Pearl's husband finally admits.  "I'm a bad listener.  I'm 
not a very good talker either."  Regretfully, such insightful lines like 
these rarely occur in A WALK ON THE MOON.  Instead, the movie just limps 
along until it runs out the clock, having never accomplished anything.  
The only memorable parts of the movie are a few good Woodstock songs, 
but you probably already know them anyway.
A WALK ON THE MOON runs 1:45 but feels longer.  It is rated R for sex, 
nudity, profanity and drug usage and would be fine for older teenagers.

Remember the dude who was Patrick Swayze's friend in GHOST (8/10), and then
screwed him over in the name of greed? Yeah? Well, his name was Tony Goldwyn
and this film is his directorial debut.
PLOT:
Square husband takes his frustrated wife and blossoming daughter to their
annual retreat in the Catskills mountains. During their stay, the husband
has to constantly drive back to town for work, leaving the wife to glad-eye
the local free-spirited blouse salesman, and the daughter to enjoy her
initial rites of passage into womanhood.
CRITIQUE:
This film did not offer me any new insight into the human condition, the
late sixties, the Jewish getaways, humor, blouse salesmen or the flowering
of a young girl. It did however include a typical 60s hippie soundtrack (if
you like that kind of thing), a great performance put forth by the
underrated Diane Lane, who projects the wife's utter desperation very
effectively, and Viggo Mortensen. Now despite his character's lack of depth
and absence of emotion, Viggo still managed to hold my attention simply by
his form as an actor, his presence as a bonafide moochacho, and his slick
mane. Ironically, I kept joking to my friend that they could've just called
this film the "Blouse Man" solely on the number of times they coined those
words. It is only later that I found out that the makers behind this
yawn-fest had originally had the foresight to title it "Blouse Man". Oy vey!
The husband in this film was also a disappointment by the way of the
lackluster performance given by the miscast Liev Shrieber, and his
character's ultimately unconvincing actions. In fact, for a film that
features a faithful Jewish wife cheating on her husband at the Woodstock
concert no less, this movie offered very little actual drama, and a
resolution that just seemed a little too tidy for my taste. Anna Paquin was
good as the confused daughter, but all of her transformations have already
been seen before in other better films, and the time dedicated to her
character in this film, was simply not enough to care. Other than that, the
jokes were all adult-oriented and lame for my taste, and the Woodstock scene
was obviously shot within a group of fifteen people or so. All in all, I
wouldn't recommend this film on any level, unless you are a huge Viggo fan
(there's a shot of his ass in this one as well), enjoy sexual re-awakenings
(via a couple of nicely shot sex scenes featuring the lovely Lane) and love
the Diane Lane. Otherwise, this film offers a weak plot, very little in
dramatic interest, and nothing memorable to offer cinema-goers.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Most of the scenes in the Catskill mountains were actually shot up North in
Montreal, Canada.
Diane Lane was married to actor Christopher Lambert from 1988 to 1994, at
which time, they got divorced.
The voice of the social director at the camp is none other than the voice of
Marge Simpson from TV's "The Simpsons", Julie Kavner.
This film went through three other title changes before settling on the one
set to its poster now: BLOUSE MAN, KISS THE SKY and OVER THE MOON.
Local Montreal movie critic Bill Brownstein makes a cameo appearance as a
customer in one scene at the husband TV repair workshop.
