If director John Dahl has a forté, it's his ability to take a story
featuring backwoods cops, seedy desert motels, filthy truck stops and dimly
lit bars full of lowlifes and make it enormously entertaining.  He also has
an uncanny knack for taking marginal B and C-list talent and making them
seem like Oscar contenders, even though the material is more akin to stuff
you'd find in a made-for-cable movie.
Actually, Dahl's two best films - Red Rock West and The Last Seduction -
debuted on pay cable, a medium that is taken slightly less seriously than
Tara Reid's chances of winning an Oscar.  The Academy doesn't even let films
like these qualify for their little year-end party, which was a shame
because Seduction's Linda Fiorentino deserved a Best Actress nomination (she
won the Independent Spirit Award, as well as trophies from critics in London
and New York).
But Joy Ride is a different story...or is it?  The film is getting a wide
release from a major distributor, but it's still set in the desert and is
populated by the same small-town cretins we grew to lovingly despise in West
and Seduction.  There are no big stars here, and there are barely any little
ones, either.  And the scariest thing of all is that Ride has been sitting
on the shelf nearly as long as O, the monumentally delayed modern update of
Othello (filming wrapped in early 2000).
But Ride is a surprisingly good little flick.  It's about a straight-laced
Berkeley student named Lewis (Paul Walker, The Fast and the Furious) who has
a crush on a girl from his New Jersey hometown.  Lewis buys a used car to
pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski, Here on Earth) in Boulder, hoping the two
will bond during the cross-country drive.  But right before he leaves, Lewis
finds out his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman) has just
been busted for a DUI in Salt Lake City.  No problem - Salt Lake City is on
the way to Boulder, so Lewis bails Fuller out and agrees to drive him as far
as Denver.
Grateful for the bail and ride, Fuller buys Lewis a CB radio so the two can
monitor police activity as they speed through the dusty west. Saying the CB
is like "a prehistoric internet," the bored Fuller talks his brother into
impersonating a woman to lure a desperate-sounding trucker with the handle
"Rusty Nail" to a hotel room with the promise of a good time.  The boys stay
in the room next-door and listen like a couple of giggling schoolgirls
before falling asleep.
They awaken to a grisly scene in the next room and shortly thereafter find
out Rusty Nail (voiced by Matthew Kimbrough) knows who they are and is
hell-bent on revenge.  Dahl expertly ratchets up the tension into an
edge-of-your-seat frenzy that only gets the slightest bit silly when Rusty
Nail's truck is trying to run them down (it's too much like Christine,
Jeepers Creepers or that dopey Metallica video).  Dahl never shows us what
Rusty Nail looks like, which helps to make the story all the more
disturbing.
It's a pretty simple idea, but the whole thing is brought to life by Ride's
two screenwriters, who have each directed enjoyable television shows (Clay
Tarver, Upright Citizens Brigade and Jeffrey Abrams, Felicity).  Like Dahl's
previous films, he gets great performances from his actors, too.  Walker
shows his decent performance in Furious wasn't a fluke (although I'm still
not entirely convinced - he's way too pretty to be any good, right?) and
even gets naked with Zahn for one scene.

I walked out of "Joyride" a little dazed and unsure of what I had just seen. My
uncertainty was because I thought I had seen a great film but in reality, upon
closer inspection, "Joyride" is not great but it is a damn good scary ride. 
"Joyride" begins with Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) at college talking to his best
friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) on the phone. He plans to pick her up at Colorado
and take her to back on a trip to New Jersey. On the way, Louis hears that his
brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), has been arrested for being drunk and disorderly
in Utah. Louis picks him up on his detour and then proceeds to pick up Venna.
Before you can say "Road Trip," Fuller decides to buy a CB radio for forty
dollars ("a prehistoric Internet"). Before arriving in Colorado, they play
around with the CB and find one trucker on their frequency by the name of Rusty
Nail. Fuller convinces Louis to play a prank and pretend to be a woman named
"Candy Cane" and to meet Rusty Nail at a motel. Big mistakes are always made but
that is one mistake that should not have been made. Let's say all hell breaks
loose once they get to the motel as this truck driver turns out to be a raging
psychopath with a road rage complex. 
There is nothing astounding or inspring about "Joyride" but it does have great
intensity. As directed by John Dahl ("Red Rock West"), it is so intense that you
will often be left gasping for air. It also helps that three terrific actors
have been cast who are likable enough to keep us scared for them. Paul Walker
("Pleasantville") is both sympathetic and innocuous as Lewis, a kid that looks
like a jock who wishes he were somewhere else. Steve Zahn is simply a great
comic live wire as Lewis's jailbird brother, completely funny and convincingly
scared throughout. He has one great moment where he saves Venna from some
rednecks in a bar by pretending to be as manly as possible. Kudos must also go
to Leelee Sobieski's thankless role as Venna where she has enough serene beauty
to keep her watchable in all the chaos. She has one great line when she
discovers who is chasing them: "I am not going to be scared of a radio."
As for the killer Rusty Nail, well, we never actually see him - only hear his
menacing, malicious voice. Someone said that it reminded them too much of the
killer's phone voice from "Scream." But this is not a clever pun on slasher
flicks - "Joyride" puts "Scream" and most other thrillers of late to shame. It
is a latter-day update on "Duel" and it keeps you on edge and makes you bounce
and scream. In other words, a real thriller that thrills and intensifies the
nerves. Don't say I didn't warn you.

  JOY RIDE (director: John Dahl; screenwriters: Clay Tarver/J. J. Abrams;
cinematographer: Jeffrey Jur; editors: Eric L. Beason/Scott Chestnut/Todd E.
Miller/Glen Scantlebury; cast: Steve Zahn (Fuller Thomas), Paul Walker (Lewis
Thomas), Leelee Sobieski (Venna), Jessica Bowman (Charlotte), Matthew Kimbrough
(Trucker's Voice); Runtime: 95; 20th Century Fox; 2001) 
 "Joy Ride" is calculated to draw fear from the viewer and does not attempt to
develop character or enlarge its story, as it goes on a wild cross-country ride
into dark terrain. This on the road film is set in the open spaces of the West.
Its menacing trucker theme reminded me most of Steven Spielberg's 1971 film
"Duel," though this one is played more for laughs. It's also aided by many
noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the
film a quirky humor, as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas
stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars. But here the material
is freshened with a different take on it. 
A University of California student, Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker), calls up his
unrequited love, Venna (Leelee Sobieski), someone he's romantically interested
in but has only been Platonic friends with so far. She's from his New Jersey
hometown and is now a college freshman in Boulder, Colorado. He offers the
attractive girl a ride home for her summer break in a beat-up vintage 70s
Chrysler Newport he just purchased for this occasion. His good-for-nothing
brother, Fuller (Zahn), a petty criminal with oodles of manic energy and a gift
for trouble, is coincidentally being released from a Salt Lake City, Utah jail.
Lewis begrudgingly agrees to also pick him up on the request of his sister,
hoping he won't ruin his secret romantic plans. 
Fuller buys a CB radio for $40 and uses the handle Black Sheep and goads the
more timid and straight-arrow Lewis into accepting the handle of Mama's Boy, and
then gets him to disguise his voice as a young lady with the handle of Candy
Cane. They play a practical joke on a trucker with the handle Rusty Nail (the
voice of Matthew Kimbrough), by getting him to come to the next-door room in the
Wyoming motel they are staying at with a bottle of pink champagne to meet her at
midnight. 
They get a laugh over this as they listen in through the thin motel walls when
he arrives, but the trucker doesn't take the joke lightly. In fact, he fatally
disfigures the mistaken guy in that motel room, who is found unconscious on the
highway the next morning. 
The brothers get no comfort from the Wyoming State Troopers investigating the
murder and find themselves on the road again and being followed by the trucker
in his gigantic rig, whose ominous voice we hear intimidating them over the CB
and telling them that they'll pay for that joke. But we never see him through
the hazy windshield of his rig, which makes him even more scary. When the
brothers reach Venna, they think they are out of the woods after telling their
twisted tormentor there's no young woman. They therefore fail to tell her what
happened--not wanting to scare her off. But returning to their Nebraska motel
after a bitter experience in a redneck bar, they receive a threatening call from
Rusty Nail and he mysteriously knows everything about them and Venna. How he
does--just doesn't seem to matter, as the film plays out its hand as a
sophomoric joke gone dangerously bad. Anyway, while the story is moving at a
frenetic pace, serious thought is not called for. There's B-film fun here if you
don't mind the many holes in the story and how slight the plot is and how the
sadistic trucker can set so many successful traps for them when it doesn't seem
possible, and that we are never let in on the secret of how he does it. 
When the boys frantically get Venna to forget about the room she paid for and
jump into their car to hit the road, she only asks: "How scared am I supposed to
be?" Fuller nervously says, "Much more than usual." 
There's a sense of the macabre in the Nebraska cornfields, as the psychopathic
homicidal trucker starts to do his thing as he closes in on them. But there's
always an element of fun in how absurd this all is, and the mostly teen-ager
audience where I saw this film laughed at parts of it and shrieked in fright
during the parts that were creepy. 
It's not a terribly interesting film but the director John Dahl ("Red Rock
West"/"The Last Seduction") and his writers Clay Tarver and J. J. Abrams, have
made a film that knows its audience and knows how to pull its punches. It's an
easy film to critique for what it doesn't do, but what it does do very well is
take you for a comically dark fantasy ride and the filmmaker keeps this thriller
tense throughout. The result is a cleverly done cultish film that's scary,
building to that grotesquely violent finale in the motel. It's also a bit kinky
without any explicit sex scenes. A film that should be admired totally for its
entertainment value and filmmaking craftsmanship, and the engaging performance
by Zahn.

Halloween is coming up and if you're in the mood for an old fashioned,
Grade B thriller, "Joy Ride" may be right up your alley. The production
makes some mistakes, but manages to establish and maintain a palpable
sense of menace by tapping into areas of primal fear. You know that
vague discomfort you feel while driving in the middle of nowhere late at
night? "Joy Ride" plops you into that setting, then ups the fear factor
by adding an anonymous figure, one that cannot be reasoned with, whose
only goal is to get his hands on you.
Here's the set-up. Lewis (Paul Walker) is a college student who dreams
of turning his relationship with Venna (Leelee Sobieski) from platonic
to romantic. To that end, he agrees to pick her up from her school in a
different city, looking forward to a road trip with the girl of his
dreams. Just as he is leaving, he learns that his older brother, Fuller
(Steve Zahn), is in jail. Despite being leery over his seemingly
incorrigible sibling, Lewis heads to the pokey and picks him up.
While on the road to Venna-land, Fuller buys a cheap used CB radio,
installs it in the car and starts fiddling with the old machine ("This
is like a prehistoric Internet!" he chirps happily). Before long, he
gets Lewis to join in the fun, adopting a female voice and using the
name Candy Kane to stir up nearby truckers. In short order, a
gravel-voiced driver using the handle Rusty Nail starts chatting with
Ms. Kane.
The boys carry the prank further, luring Rusty Nail to a local motel for
a rendezvous with the fictitious young lovely, while they press their
ears to the wall of a neighboring room to listen to the reaction. But
the practical joke explodes and the boys find themselves pursued across
the dark rural highways by a killer bent on vengeance. When they pick up
Venna, things get even worse  Rusty Nail decides that, in lieu of Candy
Kane, Venna will do.
The actors make fine surrogates for the viewer. Paul Walker is the
bland, easily influenced everyman, Leelee Sobieski stays suitably
wide-eyed as a bright kid thrust into an insane situation and Steve Zahn
adds texture as the comic relief who watches in horror as his little
joke turns lethal.
Rusty Nail is a great villain. We've all heard voices like his calling
right-wing chat shows late at night, talking conspiracies and
Armageddon. Wisely, the filmmakers never show us his face. Foolishly,
they do show the gruesome results of his attacks  in general, a
description of something horrible is far more chilling than a picture.
Despite an over-reliance on stunt driving late in the proceedings, "Joy
Ride" works because we know that there really are crazy people out
there, and that on any given night we could become the target of one of
them.

Susan Granger's review of "JOY RIDE" (20th Century-Fox)
    Unseen terror is always more frightening than the obvious - and
that's what makes John Dahl's newest thriller so scary.  College is over for the
summer when Lewis (Paul Walker), a Berkeley freshman, buys a beat-up '71
Chrysler Newport so that he can pick up a high-school pal, Venna (Leelee
Sobieski) at her dorm in Denver, hoping their platonic relationship will evolve
into something more as they drive home to New Jersey. En route, he makes a
detour to Salt Lake City to bail his notoriously irresponsible brother Fuller
(Steve Zahn) out of jail. When Fuller buys a used CB-radio for fun on the road,
they decide to play a prank. Using the handle "Candy Cane" - with Lewis
pretending to be an amorous woman on the prowl - they lure an amorous
trucker,"Rusty Nail," to a roadside motel at midnight. "Bring pink champagne,"
Candy Cane purrs. "It's my favorite." But when Rusty Nail turns out to be a
psycho-killer, the situation is far from humorous. Nevertheless, they pick up
Venna who cheerily chirps, "You guys ready for an adventure?" She knows nothing
about what happened - until they discover that Rusty's big black rig is
relentlessly stalking them down the highway. After "Red Rock West" and "The Last
Seduction," John Dahl proved himself a master of film noir imagery, like glaring
headlights on a deserted highway and flickering neon. Working from Clay Tarver
and J.J. Abrams clever if less-than-credible script, he utilizes them and more,
throwing in a chase through a dark Nebraska cornfield that evokes Hitchcock's
"North by Northwest" and Spielberg's "Duel" about a faceless trucker who
terrorizes a driver. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Joy Ride" is a
tense, twisting, sinister 7. It's a popcorn picture that's guaranteed to keep
you on the edge of your seat.

Ever make someone else the brunt of a practical joke -- only to learn
the joke is really on you?  The characters in Joy Ride have, and after
the lessons they learn, you can bet they'll never, ever tease anyone
else again.
Joy Ride has clearly learned from similar, high-octane road thrillers
like Breakdown.  It calculates every move, but seldom do we see the
surprises coming.  The film explores the misadventures of a college
student named Lewis (Paul Walker).  Lewis is a nice guy, having just
bought a used car to travel all the way across the country to help a
friend in need (Leelee Sobieski).  Along the way, he also stops to post
bail for his troublemaking brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), and give him a
ride as well.
Fuller buys a CB radio at a gas station to chat with the truck drivers
who cruise the deserted highways of Nevada, and soon they receive a
signal from a man with a deep, scruffy voice who calls himself Rusty
Nail.  Fuller thinks it would be funny if Lewis pretended he was a woman
and sexually teased Rusty Nail.  Lewis reluctantly agrees and eventually
invites him to a hotel.  They will stay in room 18, while they tell
Rusty Nail to visit room 17, where a fat, grumpy man will rest for the
night.
Not a very nice thing to do, and Rusty Nail doesn't particularly
appreciate the prank.  So little that the police find room 17's lodger
on the highway the next morning, lying in a permanent coma with the
lower half of his jaw ripped off.  And this is only the beginning,
because Rusty Nail wants revenge, and he'll stop at nothing to get it.
Joy Ride builds an incredible amount of tension, then releases it with
some startling violent encounters.  This works, but eventually becomes
somewhat redundant after the third or fourth time around the track. 
That does not terribly injure the film, however, for several reasons. 
We don't know who is behind the voice of Rusty Nail or the steering
wheel of that massive semi, as the mystery and suspense always keep us
guessing.  We also care about the characters; the actors' performances
are believable, as is the terrifying reality of the situation.  As well,
the story continually raises the stakes, introducing new conflicts and
characters, and exploring new environments, thanks to a well-written
script by Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams.
Thankfully, the film doesn't go overboard with needless gore and
violence.  The cinematography is also some of the year's most effective
work.  The characters' faces dimly lit by red neon hotel lights or the
soft glow of a fire, the mood contributes to the tension of the film.
Sadly, the ending an abuse of the old deus ex machina contrivance. 
Sure, we're on the edge of our seats, but really, it's a bit lazy.

Until the last part, the terror is interspersed nicely with some perfectly timed
humor.  "You guys okay to get back to the main road?" asks one friendly stranger
whom they had originally assumed to be Mr. Nail.  "Sure, now that we're not
dead," Fuller jokes back, while still shaking in his boots from their near death
experience.  The funniest scene comes when Fuller demonstrates just the right
technique to diffuse a brewing bar battle with a group of hostile rednecks.
JOY RIDE is funny, frightening and fabulously fun.  And it's all made quite
plausible.  One thing is certain, kids who see it will probably never be tempted
to pull a prank on a stranger.  And, if you see cars on the highway steering
clear of 18-wheelers, you can probably assume that they've recently seen JOY
RIDE.
JOY RIDE runs 1:36.  It is rated R for "violence/terror and language" and would
be acceptable for most teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, October 5, 2001. 
In the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

   When I was in college in the days before the Internet became a
favorite way to fool people, our idea of freshman fun was to look
up the people in town named Frank James.  We'd call every one
of them and say, "Hello, Frank?  This is Jesse.  We ride tonight!" 
I guess we thought we were original, that no one else thought of
doing this--which explains why we got back nothing but yawns
from our targets.  Nowadays, the ante has been upped.  In "Joy
Ride," for example, a 19-year-old college kid and his older
brother have fun with a vintage CB radio in a 1971 car newly
owned by one of them.  The idea for a prank comes from the
shrivelled brain of Fuller Thomas (Steve Zahn), who has just
been bailed out of jail for a drunk-and-disorderly charge by his
more sensible and less daring brother, Lewis Thomas (Paul
Walker).  Lewis hooks up on the radio with a guy whose CB
name is Rusty Nail (uncredited in the cast because he is never
seen) and, pretending that he's a hot babe name Candy Cane
offers to meet the truck driver in a specific motel. "Bring a bottle
of pink champagne."  Apparently when the driver, whose physical
charm can be only imagined by the audience in the theaters
seats, discovers that this fictitious Candy Cane is a big, grouchy
guy, he decides he doesn't like being played around with and
resorts extreme measures.
   "Joy Ride" is directed by John Dahl, whose past contributions
have included a top-grade B movie called "Red Rock West,"
about an unemployed guy played by Nicolas Cage who is
mistaken for a contract killer and featuring Dennis Hopper in the
role of a psycho who is the real hit man, "Lyle, from Dallas." 
Even better is Dahl's "The Last Seduction," with  Linda Fiorentino
as a sexy but pathological woman who dumps her husband,
takes his drug-deal cash, and makes a local upstate guy her
patsy.  When put side by side with those beauties, "Joy Ride" is
Dahl-disappointing, pretty conventional even if the villain is a
truck rather than a human being, with the evil truck as the only
thing this movie has in common with the vastly superior thriller,
"Breakdown."  Nor can Steve Zahn, admittedly a funny funny
guy, or Paul Walker, perhaps the handsomest actor of his
generation, match in acting ability Dahl favorites like Fiorentino,
J.T. Walsh or Bill Pullman.
   The comic antics come from Steve Zahn, who metamorphizes
from a hell-raising good-time guy to one scared pup while the
seriousness (and stick-like acting) comes from Walker, who as a
guy completing freshman year in college is determined to change
his platonic relationship with Venna (Leelee Sobieski) into
something spicier.  He leads her instead into the scariest
adventure of her life as she is set up for cannon fodder by a truck
driver (or rather by a truck--which is the only villain we can see),
hoping to be rescued by her two companions in their vintage car
with a vintage CB radio.
   Dahl is better at staging a few scares than in making much out
of Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams' script.  The highway used in
Northern Nevada to stand in for Laramie, Wyoming and environs
is a scary place of seedy, anonymous motels made especially
hair-raising when photographed during a dark and stormy night.
Rated R.  Running time: 98 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

PLOT:
A dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with
a trucker on their CB radio. It isn't long before their little prank gets
someone put into a coma (long story) and the next thing you know, the trucker is
following them too. Lotsa nuttiness ensues and then, they pick up their other
friend, Venna, a girl who the dude has a crush on. But what's this...? The
trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young
whippersnappers...? You bet! Buckle up, Dorothy...this is gonna be one bumpy
ride!
CRITIQUE:
A good ol' time at the movies! Here's a film that actually gives away most of
its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything "new" to the
forefront (if you've seen flicks like DUEL and BREAKDOWN, you've crossed this
path before), but still manages to entertain you gangbusters, with realistic
situations, believable characters, funny moments, thrills, chills, the whole
shebang. Let's give it up for director John Dahl, who continues to put out solid
films every other year (if you haven't seen RED ROCK WEST, do yourself a favor
right now, and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest
convenience). And much like that film, this one has an excellent premise and
sets everything up at an even pace. It gives you a little bit of background on
each of the main three characters, and then shows you how one small prank, can
lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone! Paul Walker really surprised me in
this movie, since I've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty
face (and damn, is it ever pretty or what?!) But here, he actually manages to
put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which
you are so closely tied to the main characters. Sobieski is also good, but she
isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think, but the man who really takes this
film to another level, is Steve Zahn.
If you've loved this guy as the "goofball" in most of his previous roles, you'll
appreciate him even more here, as the dude who starts off as one of the most
manic and excited human beings I've seen in quite some time ("This is so
awesome!!"), only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the
flick. And speaking of the ending, boy, does this movie deliver some chilling
moments during its final 15 clicks or what?!? The Arrow and I were practically
in each others arms (well, maybe I'm exaggerating, but you catch my drift) as
each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn, took it all to
an even higher level. Once again, kudos to director Dahl for being able to
generate that type of intensity, suspense and tension, with a great score,
editing, style and camerawork. Plot-wise, I too did wonder how the "bad guy" was
able to track them so well, but it didn't really bother me all that much (you
can assume that he had bugged their car?). But pretty much everything else in
the story stuck like glue and I couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and
appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance. A great movie with an even
cooler ending, this film will likely be remembered as one of the better
thrillers of the year. "This is amazing!!!"
