I will admit that I was sick of seeing the trailer of this film every time
that I went out to the theatres over the past year. It was apparently pushed
back a couple of times, but here it is now, right before the real hockey
season gets under way. Anyway, it isn't every day that Hollywood comes out
with a hockey movie which isn't turned into an actual NHL franchise, so I
was still willing to give this one a shot. Good move.
PLOT:
A small wintery town that prides itself on its dignity and game of hockey,
soon find themselves on the receiving end of a proposal from the actual New
York Rangers. The NHL team want to challenge the small town goobers to an
exhibition game, after a flattering article about their rich tradition of
hockey fills the pages of Sports Illustrated.
CRITIQUE:
I love hockey. You don't have to like hockey to like this movie, but being
Canadian, and liking hockey, both allowed me to appreciate this film's
universal message on a deeper level. Three films which kept resonating in my
mind as I watched this small but effective film, were the underdog done good
flick, RUDY, the character driven small town tale, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS (8/10),
and the bigger budgeted FOR LOVE OF THE GAME (7.5/10). Consider this one an
amalgamation of the three. Sound like you've "been there, done that"? Maybe.
But this movie worked for me. It's about heart. It's about drive,
inspiration, pride, tradition, love of a game which anyone, including
non-hockey fans, could truly appreciate. It's also about relationships and
the hardships that people have to endure to survive a small town
micro-culture, a feeling of second banana to a sport, and opportunities
missed and achieved. I don't live in a small town, but I am always smitten
by films of these kind which successfully convey the small town feel to
someone who has never been. It's easy to see how many of these communities
are deemed to be extended families, as every little thing once does somehow
seems to affect every one else in the group. So strange.
Not only was this film able to convey this atmosphere convincingly with many
sharply written characters all grieving on some level or another, but even
more importantly, it was able to resonate the importance and deeply
ingrained feeling of love for a sport, which allowed us to feel for these
characters, and obviously, root for them in the big game. You should know
that this film does not feature a lot of hockey play. In fact, I would say
that it is more of a character-driven film based around a common "obsession"
which happens to be the game of hockey. There are funny moments, dramatic
moments, touching moments, and obviously moments of fun hockey. I enjoyed
all of the performances in the film, except for the Burt Reynolds character
who seemed a little too narrowly drawn for my taste, but kudos to Russell
Crowe and the rest of the gang for portraying these folks as real human
beings, instead of stick figures from the minds of Hollywood execs. There is
also a cute cameo near the end of the film (Read the little known facts if
you really want to know who it is) which seemed soooo appropriate for this
movie. Some may find this film corny and derivative, but God help me if I
didn't enjoy its every moment. Another unnamed critic hailed this film to
the "Rocky of hockey", and despite the complete banality of that statement,
I would have to agree in respect to its intent. If you're in the mood for a
feel-good, character-driven drama featuring some good performances, funny
and tender moments, then this is one that you should definitely check out.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
When you consider the fact that this actor is Canadian, has gone on the
record as saying that he loves hockey, and that he starred in director Jay
Roach's two previous directing efforts (Roach is the director of this film
and married to the singer from The Bangles, Susanna Hoffs), it shouldn't
surprise you to find out that actor Mike Myers makes a quirky and humorous
cameo near the end of this film. He plays a hockey commentator.
Actor Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand but now calls Australia home.
You might remember his wife in this film, actress Mary McCormack, from her
popular role of Alison Stern, wife of the self-acclaimed "king of all media"
Howard Stern, in the movie PRIVATE PARTS (7/10).
Shot entirely in Alberta, Canada, this film apparently led to at least one
barroom brawl when actor Russell Crowe was alleged to have gotten himself
into such an altercation during the filming months of this movie.
In case you are living on the planet Mars and still don't know who writer
David E. Kelly is, he is the man behind the two Emmy-winning shows, "Ally
McBeal" and "The Practice". He's also known for being the man who once got
Michelle Pfeiffer to agree to marry him in 1993, and has since been married
to the lovely actress, and the man who penned three other motion pictures,
TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY, the monster tale, LAKE PLACID and FROM THE
HIP, which has apparently based on some of his own experiences as a lawyer.
Sadly, it starred actor Judd Nelson :) David actually used to be a lawyer in
Boston and attended both Princeton University and Boston University Law
School.
This film was originally titled POND RULES.

*1/2 (out of 4) The previews for the movie are pretty good. They show a
little plot, all the characters, and the emotional highlights, all
spliced together to give a general impression of the script.
Unfortunately, the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes.
The residents of Mystery love hockey. Mystery and hockey go together
like Texas and high school football. The townsfolk love hockey so much
that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man
(yes, that's one of the movie's jokes.) Every Saturday, the best players
pair off for a game, and the whole town comes to watch. 
The town's prodigal son Charlie (Hank Azaria) wrote an article on the
weekly game for Sports Illustrated. Mystery's national fame has the town
abuzz. A week later, Charlie actually shows up in person, and he brings
with him an offer from the NHL. The New York Rangers will come to
Mystery to play the locals.
The Mysterians see this as both good and bad. On the one hand, they'd
love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition. On the other
hand, they don't want to turn up as the butt of Leno and Letterman
jokes.
The movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the
proposition. 
Biebe (Russell Crowe) has just been retired from the team and is asked
to coach the boys, including his new replacement. He's already
resentful, and to top it off Charlie has been making eyes at his wife.
Crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film, so he's just kind
of stuck with constantly brooding.
Charlie, meanwhile, is resentful of having born in a town where hockey
is the only measure of a man's worth. His "gift" of the feature story,
and of the New York Rangers, was his way of compensating for not being a
better skater. He hoped it would earn him some respect and merit, but
the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him.
Burt Reynolds could have been interesting as Walter, the judge whose
courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans. Walter actually
has some experience with collegiate hockey, but he actively tries to put
it behind him. He wants his son to take the game more seriously, but he
wants his community to just get over it. Reynolds could have been good,
but sloppy writing and/or editing keep Walter in the corner, and so
Reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together.
One character actually was interesting. Biebe's wife (Mary McCormack),
like the judge, understood that there was more to life than hockey. But
unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community. She
chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open. Her unique
insight is verbalized once, and it lasts only a scene before it is gone,
but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom.
MYSTERTY, ALASKA follows a handful of other characters, but none are
well developed or worth mentioning.
The biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to
the story, no underlying thing that the movie is really ABOUT. Instead,
Roach and screenwriters David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne try to cram the
entire human condition into this sports comedy. They try to make you
laugh and cry, to feel outrage and pride. They present the framing and
cadence for jokes, but there's nothing truly funny. They show
appropriately staged scenes of sadness, but they give you nothing to be
really sad about. As columnist Molly Ivins would say, it's all hat, no
cattle.
The perfect opportunity arises for Roach to say what this movie is
really about. There is a funeral scene, played with appropriate gravity
and somber music. It is a chance for the characters to reflect on their
lives and decide what's truly important. Russell Crowe steps forward to
speak, about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us. He says that what
really matters in life is "community...." Then adds "and hockey." I
guess these Mysterians really are as shallow as they appear.
Only mildly bad, Mystery, Alaska probably deserves 2 stars. I even
laughed out loud, genuine laughs in places. But I docked it an extra
half star when Mike Myers, a friend of Roach, turned up in a role that
didn't suit him. Myers is a comic character actor. He puts on masks,
becomes an outrageous caricature, and is funny. He's great as Austin
Powers, Dr. Evil, or any of his Scottish characters. 
Nobody else in MYSTERTY, ALASKA is a comic caricature. All the other
people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles. For
Roach to bring in Myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt
toward the rest of his cast, toward his audience, and indeed toward the
film itself. It's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not
worth taking seriously.

1999 - 118 minutes
Rated R (for sex and profanity).
Reviewed October 2, 1999.
"Mystery, Alaska" is an uneasy hybrid of two genres, one of which is way past 
its prime. At first glance and through the advertising campaign for the film, 
it appears to be a sports movie for the whole family, about a small-town 
hockey team, a la "The Mighty Ducks." The "sports movie" has, in the last 
fifteen years, become a reliable staple of big-studio films, from 1984's "The 
Natural," to 1988's "Major League," to 1988's "Bull Durham," to 1992's "The 
Might Ducks," to 1994's "D2: The Mighty Ducks," to 1994's "Major League 2," 
to 1996's "D3: The Mighty Ducks," to 1998's "Major League 3: Back to the 
Minors," to the currently-in-release "For Love of the Game." Just taking a 
gander at the aforementioned pictures, which amount to roughly only 5% of the 
total "sports movies" in recent years, is quite a dizzying and tedious task. 
By now, films that conclude with the biggest cliche of them all, "The Big 
Game," are no longer suspenseful, nor can audiences honestly care about the 
outcome. The protagonists either win (which they usually do) or they lose; 
there aren't many other twists you can throw into the rather limitied 
proceedings. 
But this is where the formula for "Mystery, Alaska" gets a little tricky (and 
mind-boggling, for that matter). The film is rated R, for several sexual 
situations (including a premature ejaculation scene that was carried out to 
much more successful effect in last summer's "American Pie") and for a 
dizzying parade of profanity (let's just say the F-word is not used 
sparingly). While much of the film does center on the rag-tag hockey team in 
the snowy mountain town of Mystery, Alaska, and the impending game that they 
will be playing against the professional New York Rangers, the rest of the 
118-minute film dwells around the many characters who inhabit the team or are 
a part of the town. Subplots are brought up almost ludicrously too often, so 
that many different minor stories are being played out simultaneously. 
Extramarital affairs, fatal heart attacks, a gun-shooting, a trial, and 
teenage puppy love are just a hint of the issues that are dealt with 
throughout, therefore cutting off all chances of children seeing and enjoying 
the film. Consequently, the hockey scenes are portrayed in such a 
tried-and-true, flatly-filmed manner that adults will most likely be bored 
with these moments. And yet, if "Mystery, Alaska" fails to attract an 
audience (since there really isn't one), at least you have to commend 
director Jay Roach ("Austin Powers"), screenwriters David E. Kelley (TV's 
"The Practice") and Sean O'Byrne, and its distributor Hollywood Pictures, for 
having the courage to make a somewhat off-beat film that does not cut corners 
or condescend to a certain audience simply to earn a quick buck. It doesn't 
always work, and the screenplay remains seriously flawed and uneven, but it's 
unusually ambitious for a "sports movie" and should be admired on that simple 
basis. Let us all be thankful, at least, that "Mystery, Alaska" is not "D4: 
The Mighty Ducks."
The film takes a look at all of the interrelated townspeople of Mystery, as 
they prepare for their run-in with the Rangers, and most of the characters 
are given their own individual stories, which are not all equally efficient 
and often clank together like giant pieces of metal. John (Russell Crowe) is 
a thirtysomething married man and sheriff who lives to play hockey every week 
on the team, until he is abruptly cut in order to make room for the 
much-faster Steve (Ryan Northcott), a bright-eyed teenager. Fellow teammate 
Skank Marden (Ron Eldard) is a womanizer who "loves to play ice hockey and 
fornicate because those are the two most fun things to do in cold weather." 
Unfortunately, Skank has currently begun to have an affair with the unhappy 
wife (Lolita Davidovich) of Pitcher (Colm Meaney), the town major, who has 
forgotten how to show love and human compassion. Then there's Judge Walter 
Burns (Burt Reynolds), a strict father whose son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), 
another hockey player, is constantly being put down, and a teen daughter 
(Rachel Wilson) who is the girlfriend of Steve. Finally, the arrival of 
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a wealthy former resident of Mystery who 
returns with the big news about the New York Rangers, causes John's wife 
(Mary McCormack) to question whether she made the wrong choice years ago when 
she decided to get married, have kids, and stay put in the tiny burg of 
Mystery.
The scenes of people playing ice hockey in "Mystery, Alaska" are kept to a 
pleasing minimum (discarding the neverending climax), so that the characters 
themselves have a chance to be developed. While nothing pleases me more than 
a character-driven motion picture, and this one oddly reminded me of 1996's 
underrated treasure, "Beautiful Girls," the writing is too often lackluster 
and not nearly as witty and memorable as writer David E. Kelley's current 
television ventures, including "The Practice" and "Ally McBeal." Also, where 
"Beautiful Girls" was an intelligently-drawn comedy-drama about the 
relationships between people in a snowy U.S. town, "Mystery, Alaska" is 
sloppy and often too neat-and-tidy for its own good. There are no laughs, 
even though the film constantly attempts to be funny and, aside from two or 
three particular instances, the drama is rarely effective the way it could 
have easily been had the screenplay been written with a surer hand.
On the positive side, the inner turmoil of John, handled well by Russell 
Crowe, as he nears the end of his hockey career, is noticably similar to that 
of Kevin Costner in the higher-profile "For Love of the Game." While Costner 
was instructed to sit around and whine and pout, Crowe's struggle to enter 
into the next phase of his life is more subtle, and therefore, cogent. 
Additionally, the underused Lolita Davidovich (1994's "Intersection," one of 
the most overlooked films of the decade) is touching as the mayor's wife, a 
woman confused about her marriage and unsure what her recent affair means. 
Although more could have been done with it, the sweetest relationship comes 
in the form of the youngest one, between 17-year-old Steve and his 
girlfriend, who fears his rising popularity will cause him to forget about 
her. The two performers, Ryan Northcott and Rachel Wilson, making their major 
film debuts, strike the right notes throughout.
A perceptible strain for melodrama, further subplots come off as nothing more 
than gimmicks to add an extra amount of conflicts, including one in which a 
character suddenly dies, and another that feels like it's come right out of a 
John Grisham courtroom drama. More focus on the interesting characters and 
their predicaments, and the complete cutting of these unnecessary storylines, 
might have aided the film quite well, overall.
After "Austin Powers," its sequel, and this more adult film, director Jay 
Roach has not proven himself yet to be anything more than an 'adequate' 
filmmaker. He usually aims for the obvious, and in this film's case, 
distractingly forces silly humor onto the rest of the material, including an 
insipid, totally unfunny cameo by Mike Myers. "Mystery, Alaska" is a 
respectable film as far as "sports movies" go, but it really is frustrating 
to watch a group of capable performers that are so far above the given 
material. It's clearly a case in which a film's aspirations were higher in 
the planning stages than what was translated to film.

"The Rangers taking their off-time to go to some cold village and play
pond hockey with eskimos: it's a joke!"
Starring Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Colm Meaney, Hank Azaria, Mary
McKormick, Lolita Davidovich, Maury Chaykin. Rated R.
After watching Mystery, Alaska, I decided to do a little research. I
ventured over to the Internet Movie Database, the premier source of
movie information on the net, to test a theory. I searched for movies
and tv series about hockey, baseball, football, and basketball. When I
searched for baseball, it returned 145 movies and tv shows. Football
gave me 145 and basketball came up with 68. But when I did a search on
hockey, the result was a measly 44 references. Why is hockey so
underrepresented in pop culture? Hard to say, but while audiences seem
to be tired of sports movies of late, a hockey film or two is not
unwelcome, provided it doesn't have the words "Mighty Ducks" in the
title.
Mystery, Alaska is a hockey town. Life revolves around the "Saturday
Game", a weekly pond hockey match-up. It's not a competition. They
don't keep score. The teams are decided at random. The game is more
than a tradition: it's a legend, a way of life. A veteran of
the "Saturday Game", John Biebe, who has played for some thirteen years
is about to be honorably discharged. He's a good player, but he is
getting old and his agility on skates isn't what it used to be. He has
to be liquidated to make room for an ambitious up-and-comer, a lighting-
fast high-schooler with relationship issues.
Just then, a cocky former Mystery resident who has abandoned the town
for a career in Hollywood returns -- on a helicopter, no less. But he
doesn't come empty-handed. He brings word that the New York Rangers are
going to fly to Alaska for a game of pond hockey with the "Mystery
Boys". It seems some genius at the National Hockey League had an idea
for some good, cheap promotion: why not fly the league's premier hockey
team to the middle of nowhere and have them play a sort of charity game
with mysterious "Eskimos"?
But not so fast. It seems the Rangers aren't too keen about taking
their precious free time to play pond hockey in Alaska. The players'
union files a grievance demanding that the arrangement be cancelled,
and Mystery sends their lawyer (Maury Chaykin) to represent the town
and hopefully maintain what dignity they have left. As if that wasn't
enough, crises arise in the homeland as well. The team needs a coach.
The town Mayor (Colm Meaney) wants John to do it as a sort of
retribution, but John wants to play, thereby pressing the old hockey
expert/town judge (Burt Reynolds) to take the job.
Mystery, Alaska is not only full of cliches, it clings to them as if
they were lifeblood. I don't take notes when I watch movies, but I wish
I had brought a notepad and a pen for this one just so I could write
down at least a significant portion of the countless examples of idea
recycling that goes on in this movie. To name a few: kids spontaneously
cursing for laughs, a guy who piles an inordinate amount of [fill in
food here; in this case, mashed potatoes] onto his plate when he is
distracted during dinner, a guy watching sports during sex and
screaming out when a goal is scored, and of course, the obligatory "Big
Game" ending, which we know can turn out one of two ways. I'll leave it
to you to guess which one is used here.
I've always thought of director Jay Roach as some kind of weird genius.
He is the man behind the legend that is Austin Powers and its sequel.
Both are delightful, no-holds-barred comedic masterpieces, always
reveling in their own outrageousness. With Mystery, Alaska, Roach tries
to get accustomed to the limitations of a more conventional narrative
and he doesn't always succeed. I'm not saying that he is incapable of
making good "standard" movies, far from it, I'm sure that if given the
right project he could very well extend his range. But here, working
from a script by tv vet David E. Kelley, he wants to burst out. As a
matter of fact, he finds some outlets to do just that, one of them
being -- whe else? -- Mike Myers, having oodles of fun with an
exaggerated Canadian dialect as a smarmy hockey commentator. There are
times when you sense the Jay Roach from Austin Powers coming out of the
woodwork, and those tend to be the high points. But for much of the
movie he has to restrain himself, and with a script as average as this
one it feels forced.
Nevertheless the film stays afloat. There is something about its pure,
well-intentioned affection for hockey that won me over. If, to a sports
movie, the game it's portraying is nothing more than a part of a
formula, it will not work, which is why none of the three Mighty Ducks
movies ever went anywhere. But when we feel a love for the sport, the
oldest of formulas can seem almost as good as new.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
TV scribe David E. Kelley's second big-screen effort of the year is a
hackneyed adult version of The Mighty Ducks.  Film fans, beware  this
does not mean Slapshot.  In the movie, a small Alaskan town  and its
highly competitive brand of ice hockey - graces the cover of Sports
Illustrated, culminating in a showdown with the New York Rangers.  It's
a typical David-versus-Goliath picture, with the `loser' title affixed
only to the sucker in the audience that plunked down green to watch this
slow-moving abomination.
The first words in Mystery, Alaska are an expletive spoken by a kid too
young to know any better.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be
Kelley's attempt at irony (most of the adults say `jeez' and `for God's
sake' a la another snowy pic, Fargo) or his craving to work `blue' after
years and years of living under the watchful eye of television censors.
Remember Betty White in Kelley's summertime flop Lake Placid?  It's
probably the latter.
As the film opens, Mystery eagerly awaits the new issue of Sports
Illustrated, where a feature piece on the town's beloved `Saturday Game'
is scheduled to appear.  Arriving not long after the magazine is former
resident Charles Danner (Hank Azaria, Mystery Men) an employee of Sports
Illustrated, who arrives bearing great news  the National Hockey
League, impressed with the article, has agreed to fly the New York
Rangers to Mystery for an exhibition game against the locals.
Here is Problem No. 1:  I can look past the fact that the New York
Rangers would never play Mystery, but why would the game take place in
Alaska?  Would it not make more sense to fly the Mystery players to New
York so that the game could be played on a real ice rink?  In a bigger
arena?  Where you wouldn't need to fly a television crew and legions of
media personalities?  Mystery has 32 days to prepare for the game, both
in terms of team preparation and to remedy the fact that they usually
play on a pond in front of about fifty people.  They acquire a Zamboni
while workers quickly build a grandstand and install intricate
lighting.  In one shot, the film shows four cranes building the outdoor
rink.  I don't think there are four cranes in the entire state of
Alaska, let alone Mystery.
And let's talk about the advertising.  Once the game begins, viewers
will see a ton of advertising both on and around the rink.  Locals even
complain about this advertising, which is simply the filmmaker's way of
saying `See, this isn't really product placement.  It's an integral part
of the story.'  Bullshit.  Use make-believe advertisers if you want, but
don't try to legitimize the giant Coca-Cola logo at center ice that
fills the entire screen for the opening face-off.
There are plenty of other things to complain about, like the fact that
Kelley manages to somehow wedge in a legal battle involving the
potential opening of the mega-store Price World and its Mystery-bashing
emissary (Michael McKean).  Or the use of the Winetka brothers (Adam
Beach and Leroy Peltier) lifted right from Slapshot's Hansons.  Or the
cameo from Mike Myers (Mystery director Jay Roach also helmed both
Austin Powers pics), which reveals the actor's unfunny side.  Or The
Daily Show's hysterical Beth Littleford, who appears long enough to be
only a throwaway sexual joke.
None of the above complaints come close to matching the annoying and
time-consuming subplot in which the team coach/town sheriff John Biebe
(Russell Crowe, L.A. Confidential) is dropped from the big game in favor
of a younger, faster player with premature ejaculation.  This,
exacerbated by the arrival of his wife's (Mary McCormack, True Crime)
high school sweetheart (Azaria), leads to rocky times in the Biebe
household, leaving the film filled with the gooey sentiment of the worst
imaginable Hallmark card.
Highlights include town judge/coach Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights), who
resembles another old guy named Burgess Meredith in Rocky, shouting
advice to his team through clenched jaw andwell, that's about it.
(1:59  R for adult language and sexual content)

For as cold as it gets up north, these people sure make a warm picture.
Russell Crowe (of "LA Confidential" fame) is convincing, compelling and
infinitely likeable as John Biebe the anchor of the Mystery city Saturday
pond-hockey team. Mystery is a snow-covered town where everyone knows
everyone (occasionally a little too well). The heart and pride of the small
community is solidly routed inside that little black puck.
Enter Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a former Mysterian displaced to the east
coast. He arranges to copter in the New York Rangers for a bit of high
sticking on the cold ice. "Mystery doesn't have much, but it does have its
dignity and its illusions," Judge Walter (Burt Reynolds) warns, "I suggest
you cling to both." It's an interestingly different role for Burt, though
his stern caution is ignored and Mystery goes on to mix it up with the NHL
team.
David E. Kelley of "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" (to name just a few fine
credits) provides a quality script appropriately backed up with equally fine
direction, acting and a powerful score. Aside from a sad moment where my
throat was all caught up in knots, I was smiling. I love the opening
sequence: a lone player skating atop a winding frozen river.

Dear David E. Kelley, if this is all you can do on the big screen, please 
stick to the small screen.  It's not that Mystery, Alaska is a terrible 
film Mr. Kelley, rather is a little to plain and thin on conflict.  See, 
Mr. Kelley, I an avid fan of your TV shows.  I loved your Picket Fences, I 
watch Ally McBeal every week, and the best of your shows, The Practice, I 
make time just to watch it.  What makes and made these shows so 
good?  Sharp writing, a sense of direction, and conflict.  Mr. Kelley 
you've done so well with your words every week on the small screen, what's 
up with doing the same on the big screen?
First you churn on the terrible Lake Placid which isn't worth even the 
rent, hell, how did it get made in the first place?  Then you turn out this 
quaint film, Mystery, Alaska about a small fictitious town named Mystery in 
Alaska where it's always covered in snow and the people there always ice 
skate around.  The people of the town are quaint just like the movie.  You 
got your quaint sheriff who loves to play hockey, John Biebe (Russell 
Crowe), and his quaint wife, Donna (Mary McCormack).  You got your quaint 
mayor played by Colm Meaney.  You even got Burt Reynolds in the film as a 
mean judge.  But, you know what Mr. Kelley?  Everything is just too nice in 
this film.  Sure, there are people who look like they're the bad guys, like 
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) who comes back to his home town with the New 
York Rangers to challenge the home team at a game of hockey  this is 
because the home team is so good at hockey that they've been featured in 
ESPN.  But, the bad guys, well they're quite nice also.
What we have here, Mr. Kelley, is a film that meanders around for 90 
minutes then ends.  Not much but a lot of nice people going about their 
nice lives.  Not much entertainment value either.  It's hard to do this to 
you Mr. Kelley, but for the second time this year, I'm giving one of your 
films a Skip, Skip, Skip label because it's not worth seeing.  I beg you 
Mr. Kelley, bring some of that small screen magic that you bring to Ally 
McBeal and The Practice every week onto your big screen projects, else stay 
on the small screen.

MYSTERY, ALASKA (M).  
(Hollywood Pictures/Buena Vista International)
Director: Jay Roach
Stars: Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack, Burt
Reynolds, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Michael McKean, Maury
Chaykin, Judith Ivey, Ryan Nortcutt, Mike Myers
Running time: 120 minutes. 
The good folk of Mystery, a small town in Alaska, live and
breathe little else but ice hockey.  The Saturday afternoon games on
the local pond are a social highlight, and the men guard their
positions in the team jealously.  But after an article on this hick
town team appears in the prestigious Sports Illustrated, they are
offered a one-off opportunity to play an exhibition match against the
New York Rangers.
The deal is the brainchild of celebrated sports journalist
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), who grew up in Mystery before seeking
greener pastures.  Most of the town rally around the team, with the
exception of the crusty old judge (Burt Reynolds), who urges that
Mystery cling to both its dignity and its illusions.
But as the match draws closer, tensions within the town
simmer.  The match represents something of a personal mission for John
Biebe (Russell Crowe), the town's sheriff, who has just been dumped
off the team after thirteen years.  The town's mayor (Colm Meaney,
from Con Air, etc) discovers that his wife (Lolita Davidovich) is
having an affair with Shank (Ron Eldard), a member of the team, while
Biebe becomes jealous of the former relationship that existed between
his wife (Mary McCormack) and Danner.
Mystery's brief flirtation with fame also brings with it a
number of problems, not the least of which is a sudden influx of money
and interest from big corporations that threaten the harmony of this
small town.  Can the team pull off an unlikely fairy tale win against
the best and most professional team in the business, or will defeat
rip the heart out of this tight knit community?  Mystery, Alaska is a
classic tale about an underdog that eventually has its day, but this
leisurely paced comedy takes its own sweet time about getting to the
climactic hockey match.  Director Jay Roach (the two Austin Powers
comedies) and television writer David E Kelley paint a wonderful
portrait of this small town, bringing to life its charming, laid back
lifestyle and colourful gallery of eccentric inhabitants.  At times,
it seems a little like a nice off spin from the quirky Northern
Exposure series.
Roach has assembled a strong cast to bring the delightful
residents of Mystery to life, and he has also coaxed a brief
appearance from his Austin Powers star Mike Myers, who plays a
vitriolic tv sports commentator.
As a film dealing with the fast but often violent sport of ice
hockey, Mystery, Alaska is better than Disney's increasingly tiresome
Mighty Ducks series, but somehow not as much fun as the ribald,
raunchy comedy Slap Shot.  Instead, this is another of those endearing
comedies that explore the rich textures of life in small town America,
and its quirky charms should win over most audiences.

     In MYSTERY, ALASKA, local sheriff John Biebe (Russell Crowe) contends
with feelings of inadequacy.  Writer Charlie Danner (Hank Azaria), an
expatriate resident, wants to be loved by the people he left behind.
Stern Judge Burns (Burt Reynolds) has difficulty connecting with his son
Birdie (Scott Grimes).  Mayor Scott Pitcher (Colm Meaney) and his wife
(Lolita Davidovich) face marital strife.  Studly local teen Stevie Weeks 
(Ryan Northcott) and his girlfriend Marla (Rachel Wilson) contemplate a
sexual relationship.  A grocer (Michael Buie) is charged with shooting a
potential chain-store competitor's representative (Michael McKean) in the
foot.  A promiscuous man (Ron Eldard) gets a comeuppance.  A corpulent
attorney (Maury Chaykin) makes the biggest court speech of his lifetime.
     After two obscenely bloated hours of MYSTERY, ALASKA, the question
may no longer be how David E. Kelley ("The Practice," "Ally McBeal,"
"Chicago Hope," "Snoops") can be so prolific, but why he doesn't know when
to quit.  Ostensibly, the film is the story of a tiny Alaskan hamlet with
a tradition of great skaters participating in a ritualistic Saturday
afternoon hockey game against one another.  When Danner writes a "Sports
Illustrated" cover story on Mystery, the NHL decides to send the New York
Rangers for a goodwill exhibition game against the scrappy underdogs.  The
set-up is extremely promising, gradually revealing the importance of
hockey and the "Saturday game" to the residents of Mystery.  With Carter
Burwell's typically splendid score adding to the mystery of Mystery,
there's hope that Kelley and director Jay Roach will combine an amusing
little sociology lesson about small-town pride with the ever-appealing
scrappy underdog story.
     They then proceed to heap so much extra baggage on the story that it
never has a chance of getting off the ground.  It's one thing to spend
time on Biebe's story, in which his emasculating ouster from the Saturday
game runs parallel with his jealousy of local celebrity Danner -- who also
happens to be the old flame of Biebe's wife Donna (Mary McCormack).
There's even an excuse, however feeble, for Marla's awkward attempts to
make sure Steve won't leave her for an easier catch.  The rest of the
half-dozen or so plot threads in MYSTERY, ALASKA are just plain
inexcusable.  The first hour of the film is a grinding ordeal, so
fragmented and unfocused that it's easy to forget what it's all supposed
to be leading up to.  
     In the final half-hour, when the film finally gets around to the
hockey game, MYSTERY, ALASKA generates at least a little energy.  The
Rangers are a fairly anonymous opponent -- too much time is wasted on
tangents to create a worthy adversary -- but Roach directs the game scenes
with plenty of verve.  Then even the game begins to over-stay its welcome,
losing momentum by the minute.  Any potential for a rousing conclusion is
lost in memories of the preceding two hours, with its two typically
bombastic Kelley courtroom scenes, tedious pacing and undisciplined
script.  MYSTERY, ALASKA is a film that inspires slack-jawed frustration,
leaving a viewer scrambling for a reason why this simple concept went so
horribly wrong.  The answer may be just as simple: perhaps Kelley grew
bored with something as mundane as a single film, and decided to turn it
into a rambling two hour pilot for yet another television series.

Stephen Graham Jones
In 1976 Rocky said it once and for all: "I can't beat him. But that don't
bother me. The only thing I want to do is to go the distance, that's all."
The determined underdog, the noble nobody, the champion-in-waiting. These
are the things we love. Mystery, Alaska (re)delivers them, packaged nicely
in snow and isolation and every episode of Northern Exposure. Which isn't at
all a drawback: Northern Exposure had some strong writing. Refreshingly, so
does Mystery, Alaska, though of course it does--as the genre demands--dabble
the slightest bit in hero-making. But so be it. Heroism and sports are
synonymous in the American conscience. As are the Mighty Ducks and hockey.
And, not unlike Mighty Ducks, it does all come down to that one final
game--locals vs. the professionals--and it's all balanced such that
individual victories and team victories are interdependent, and there are
all the necessary enthematic rallies in the halftime locker room ('you've
got the rest of your lives,' etc), but, in spite of all these predictable
developments, Mystery, Alaska manages to set itself apart. Or, slightly
above.
This is due largely to Russell Crowe as John Biebe, the aging Sheriff
who--in the space of what has to be the most condensed 24 hours Mystery's
ever seen--gets bumped off the local hockey team, has to arrest one of his
players on shooting charges, and is called to investigate a 'mysterious'
helicopter carrying his wife's old flame Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) back
into town. Danner is of course bringing the news we already know from the
trailer: that the New York Rangers are coming to town. Soon enough
everything and everyone's in motion, preparing, anticipating, etc. Everyone
except Judge Burns (Burt Reynolds), that is, the pessimistic voice of reason
here. But he gets very little screentime, too, which makes it easy to get
caught up in the fervor of this small town attempting to prove itself
to/against the big city, which is nicely carried out on an individual level,
with Sheriff Biebe, who has to similarly prove himself to the town council
(who for some strange reason decide who gets to play in the weekly games).
But Crowe doesn't carry the movie himself. Mary McCormack as Donna Biebe is
the real show-stealer, in an understated way. And of course Skank (Ron
Eldard, with some good sitcom training) provides enough philandering humor
that things never get boring. They do however, get a little contrived in a
couple of places. The first of these is a court trial that, for a
legally-hip audience, either rings a bit false or isn't quite Liar Liar-ish
enough to mute our critical faculties. The second contrivance is the
so-called low point of the narrative, when all the characters are
simultaneously and conveniently hit with something from which it seems they
surely won't be able to recover. In addition, there's a strange little
teenage romance going on between the Judge's daughter and Stevie, the new
team star, a relationship which seems to have been written in largely for
comic effect, as it has no real relevance to the rest of the movie. It is
funny, though, and does make room for the best line of the movie, to the
Judge, from his wife, about his daughter's sex life, in response to his
question about what they're talking about without him: "If you don't leave
[the room] right now, I swear I'll tell you."
The Judge wisely backs out of the room, and Burt Reynolds is all hat-tipping
Bandit as he does.
What's nice about Mystery, Alaska are those kind of moments, where you
forget you're in a sports-movie and begin to suspect you might be getting
caught up in some of this small town drama, the lives of these characters
which are supposed to be just padding for the slow-motion action sequences.
Yes, though, in the end Mystery, Alaska is just Hoosiers on ice, but all the
same, Hoosiers was a good movie. Mystery, Alaska could have done far worse
for a role model.

Susan Granger's review of "MYSTERY, ALASKA" (Hollywood Pictures)
Just because he just won two Emmys for "The Practice" and
"Ally McBeal" doesn't mean David E. Kelley can score every time. This
story revolves around a publicity stunt that pits the world-famous New
York Rangers in a televised exhibition game against a hometown team
from Mystery, Alaska, population 633.  The genesis for the face-off is
a "Sports Illustrated" article, written by a former native, Hank
Azaria, that explores the rural legend of a small Alaskan town where,
for generations, young men aspire to nothing more than being on the
local ice hockey team. It's a place where people are so obsessed with
the sport that they leave the streets frozen for skating. And the
comedy comes from a culture clash between the media hype and the
rugged Alaskan eccentrics. Burt Reynolds plays the stuffy town judge
and hockey coach. Russell Crowe is the sheriff and, at 34, a 13-year
veteran of the team, while Ryan Northcott is a high-school whiz who
threatens Crowe's prestigious position. Directed by Jay Roach ("Austin
Powers"), it's like "Northern Exposure" meets "The Longest Yard,"
although too much time is spent on superficial strained marriages and
father-son relationships. Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack, Michael Buie,
Michael McKean, Ron Eldard, Judith Ivey, and Lolita Davidovich embody
colorful characters who add to the predictable melodrama as Little
Richard sings "The Star-Spangled Banner" and Mike Myers broadcasts the
game. There's lots going on but little depth. If you're looking for a
really good hockey movie, rent the video of George Roy Hill's
"Slapshot," which was filmed in the mid-'70s at Yale. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Mystery, Alaska" slides in with a chilly
5. The puck stops here.

Potatoes.  The secret weapon of the rag-tag group of adults who play
hockey in the extremely remote village of Mystery, Alaska is the lowly
potato.  Heated they can be shoe warmers, and cold they can be used to
plan plays.  The juvenile R-rated comedy MYSTERY, ALASKA would have been
more aptly named, THE MIGHTY DUCKS 4: NORTH TO ALASKA.
A putative comedy that includes all the well-worn sport clichés, it
tries hard to be a poignant tale as well about the bleakness and
hardships of living in the far north.  At neither a comedy nor a drama
does it come close to succeeding.
Even in the obligatory big game ending, the movie fails miserably.
Containing one of the most poorly filmed hockey sequences you could
imagine, it manages to be both confusing and boring.  Basically, we see
the puck in close-up shot back and forth ad nauseam until one team,
thank god, is finally declared the winner.
Director Jay Roach, whose only other film credits are the AUSTIN POWERS
series, seems as lost with the material as if he wandered off into a
blizzard.  MYSTERY, ALASKA is so clumsily directed that it gives support
for those who say that the real director of the AUSTIN POWERS movies was
the star himself, MIKE MYERS.
The setup for the story is that an article in Sports Illustrated ("The
Roots of Hockey") propels the local team into national prominence.   As
a publicity stunt, the New York Rangers come to town to challenge them
to a single game of "pond hockey."  ("We don't know who they are or what
they are," says the national newscaster, as the way the network plans on
promoting the game.  "We just know they have poor dental health and can
skate like the wind.")
The town, for reasons that are never made plausible, only wants to play
if they can actually beat the pros.  "Two things we've always had: our
dignity and our illusions," Judge Burns (Burt Reynolds) lectures the
town's citizens.  "I suggest we cling to them both."  Other members of
the large cast include Hank Azaria, Russell Crowe, Mary McCormack,
Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney and Maury Chaykin.
Typical of what passes for humor in the movie is a scene in the locker
room in which the coach, the town's sheriff, tells the players, "You
guys know what you're made of!"  The youngest member of the team then
proceeds to puke.
In the long chasm between the setup and the big game, we have to witness
constant bickering among the locals.  The film's R rating stems mainly
from sexual humor that is included, one supposes, as a way to juice up
the script.  Too bad.  Released as a PG-13 film, they could attract
preteen set, which might have lower standards as to what constitutes
comedy.
So is anything funny?  Yes.  There are two cameo appearances: One actor
provides a little color commentary during the game and the other sings
the national anthem.  I will not give either away since the names of
these individuals, not the script, provide most of the laughs.
MYSTERY, ALASKA runs a long 1:58.  It is rated R for language and
sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers.

On paper, "Mystery, Alaska" looks like a winner. The premise - - an
article about a small town hockey team prompts the New York Rangers to
come calling for an exhibition game - - sounds like fun. The cast
contains a slew of top notch actors, including Russell Crowe
("L.A. Confidential") and Ron Eldard ("Men Behaving Badly"), along
with Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich and the always sturdy Burt
Reynolds, supported by reliable character actors Colm Meaney ("Star
Trek: The Next Generation"), Hank Azaria (Apu from "The Simpsons"),
and Maury Chaykin. The film even boasts dandy cameo appearances from
Mike Myers and Little Richard. So why is "Mystery, Alaska" such a
mess?
Kelley, who co-wrote the film with Sean O'Byrne, is also the man
behind the inert "Jaws"-with-an-alligator rip-off "Lake Placid," and
the TV series "Picket Fences," "Chicago Hope," "Snoops," "Ally McBeal"
and "The Practice." He was crowned King of Hollywood last month when
"Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" won Emmys for Best Comedy and Best
Drama.
Angered when "The Practice" beat the infinitely superior series, "The
Sopranos," a number of alternative journalists recently declared war
on Kelley, turning out lengthy attacks on the absurdly prolific
writer. For the record, I want to make one thing clear: I disliked
David E. Kelley long before it became trendy.
While Kelley possesses some undeniable gifts, particularly the ability
to convincingly present both sides of an argument, he is essentially a
stunt writer. He takes characters and situations straight out of "The
Jerry Springer Show," removes the trailer park accents and presents
the resultant bathos as cutting edge television. He clutters his shows
with snarky interpersonal conflicts, and delights in presenting
overblown speeches, preferably in a courtroom setting (during "Lake
Placid," I half-expected to see the alligator hauled in front of a
judge).
Virtually all of Kelley's worst tendencies run unchecked in "Mystery,
Alaska." For most of the film, the hockey story is smothered beneath
relationship blathering and a stream of hammy speeches (and, yes,
there is a courtroom scene). Eventually, the main story kicks in,
building to a finale that tries to be a frost-bitten "Hoosiers."
The production even includes one of the most annoying movie
clichés, the "Rudy" clap. It goes like this. In a dramatic
situation where real humans would immediately break into thunderous
applause, the "Rudy" clap attempts to stir audience emotions by having
one character slowly begin applauding. Gradually, his handclaps grow
faster and faster as others join in and the whole thing builds to a
full-fledged ovation. On my irritation-meter, the "Rudy" clap lands
somewhere between calls from telemarketers and performances by Carrot
Top.
The story starts off well, with the weekly hockey game that has long
been a tradition in the tiny burg of Mystery. The game is entertaining
and the players are an enjoyable lot. But then the avalanche of
subplots begins. An early draft of this review included two paragraphs
packed with subplot descriptions, but I'll spare you the details.
While the 90 minutes that precede the big game are mostly tedious,
there are some nice moments. Ron Eldard is enjoyable as the village
Lothario. A sex scene between two randy teens provides big laughs, as
does the bit where a player is punished by being pushed into a snow
bank while wearing only a jock strap. But most of the fun occurs
during the final half-hour, as little Mystery tries to keep their
dignity in the midst of the media circus surrounding the exhibition
game. Mike Myers draws smiles as a smarmy color commentator and Mayor
Pitcher conspires with Little Richard to turn a rendition of the
National anthem into a tactical advantage for the team.
But oh, do you have to pay for those good parts. I suggest you wait
until "Mystery, Alaska" hits cable. Then you can settle back and enjoy
the minor pleasures of this trifle while reading a good book during
the dull sections. Come to think of it, that's what I do on those rare
occasions when I watch one of David E. Kelley's TV shows.

All right.  I admit it.  After seeing Lake Placid and Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me, the concept of a collaboration of David "The Bill Gates of TV"
E. Kelley and M. Jay "Cock" Roach didn't seem like an altogether good idea. 
Revision: it seemed like a terrible idea.  Despite the nice shot in the
preview of the kid rocketing down the ice, when the voice-over said "David E.
Kelley, the writer 'Ally MacBeal' and 'The Practice' and M. Jay Roach, the
director of Austin Powers" I groaned.  I expected it to be so bad that I
brought a book along with me.
A few minutes worth of word of mouth and my book went back in the car.
Unlike most movies that come highly recommended while seeming incredibly
mainstream, Mystery, Alaska did not disappoint me.  It did not annoy me.  It
did not make me cry, but it sure as hell made me laugh.
Mystery, Alaska is the story of a grassroots hockey team that ends up on the
cover of Sports Illustrated because of an article a former town dweller
(Charles Danner, played by Hank Azaria) wrote.  In it, Danner claims that "the
team of Mystery, Alaska has the skill to rival any of the NHL."  This being
American and this movie being Hollywood, the New York Rangers decide to take
the challenge and send up the team as a publicity stunt.
The first thing that will surprise you about Mystery, Alaska, aside from its
incredible scenery and ability to blend toilet humor with intelligence, is the
depth to which each character is explored.  They are all fully dynamic
individuals with background.  They all have their humorous side, they all have
their human side, and they all have their conflicts.  While real life may not
be that interesting or complete, what we the critics like to call this is good
characterization.  It's what lets the hooks penetrate our rocky hides and drag
us into the movie.
To start off with, we have John Biebe (Russell Crowe), the closest thing to a
main character that the movie has.  Biebe has been playing hockey all his
life, is desperately in love with his wife, and is the all-American Alaskan
that we'd expect.  He's even the town sheriff.  Then we have the
aforementioned writer Danner, who only seeks acceptance of the town.  We have,
for partial comedic effect and partial seriousness, Skank (a nickname), played
by Ron Eldard.  Skank gets his name for the obvious reason that he is
promiscuous to the Nth degree.  We have big-bodied, big-hearted Adam "Tree"
Lane (Kevin Durand).  We have the overweight lawyer who only loves hockey
(Maury Chaykin).  The Judge who is initially against inviting the Rangers to
play (Burt Reynolds).  And, this being a small town, the couple that is trying
to go all the way right under their parents noses (Rachel Wilson and Ryan
Northcott).
Although these characters may not be real, and the story is very obviously
not, the movie gives the impression of reality.  Hollywood being the business
of illusions, and the best illusions being the most realistic looking,
Mystery, Alaska does a very good job.
David E. Kelley should be lauded on his ability to sidestep every cliché that
could have found its way into the movie.  The characters aren't stock, the
ending unpredictable, and the laughs often shocking.
But I'm not all great words for Mystery.  It did use the toilet humor a
little too much, and it begins to get on your nerves after about thirty
seconds.

Unfortunately, there is little mystery in this film. Following in the 
footsteps of Rocky; Hoosiers; Rudy; The Mighty Ducks; and on and on, 
Mystery, Alaska is yet another underdog sports movie where the audience 
is made to wait over an hour for an inevitable final match that will 
surely come down to the last seconds. This film will likely be buried 
quickly in the always hectic fall film season.
With a population of just under 700, the town of Mystery, Alaska is 
small, homely and most everyone knows everyone; the biggest threat is 
the invasion of a mega-store and its potential harm to the status quo of 
their economy.
Once a week, the town gathers around a frozen pond for a near-religious 
experience: The Saturday Hockey Game. The players are selected by a 
special committee and are the pride of Mystery. The matches are always 
friendly as the pool of athletes is randomly divided into teams just 
before game time.
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a Mystery native, has left the town and is 
now working in New York with a television station. He remembers the old 
town games and thinks, just as Kevin Bacon thought in The Air Up There, 
that these local players might be on par with the multimillionaire 
athletes seen every weekend on television. He writes a feel-good article 
for a popular magazine and soon after returns to Mystery with the 
promise of an exhibition game, against the New York Rangers, to be 
broadcast for the whole world to see. To Charles it is a fluff piece 
that will make him money, to the Rangers it is a joke and waste of time, 
to Mystery it is a game for pride - the pride of knowing that their 
boys are just as good as any others.
The makers of Mystery, Alaska learned a lesson from Fargo: No matter how 
snowy and accent-heavy your setting, a complementary side plot is still 
necessary. In this case sexual relationships are the added oomph. 
Although premature ejaculations; teenage soap-opera relationships; 
adultery with a friend of the spouse and old crushes revisited are far 
from uncharted territory, they are portrayed here in a surprisingly bold 
manner for a sports film.
The production skates dangerously close to the realm of melodrama. One 
of the low points comes mid-film and pits the town of Mystery, in court, 
with the National Hockey League Players Union. The issue is whether or 
not the Rangers will be forced to play in the game all the way across 
the country during one of their much-valued breaks. Aside from having an 
obvious outcome, if there is no game, there is no movie, this section is 
particularly pathetic because two of Hollywood's last resort dramatic 
elements are used: a court scene and a key character's death.
There are three funny roles in Mystery, Alaska: Mike Myers, Beth 
Littleford and Michael McKean. Myers has a cameo, McKean has two scenes 
and Littleford isn't exactly a prominent character. Other than those, 
there is not much good about this film; the drama is weak and the payoff 
is predictable. Maybe the Rangers had the right idea in trying to stay 
home.

     Oh no.  Someone let David E. Kelley out of his cage for a second
time this year.  This time, the water in his LAKE PLACID is frozen over,
giving us the setting for MYSTERY, ALASKA.
     The title's surely a MYSTERY and gives you no clues about the film
 so what's it all about?  Those expecting a schlocky horror flick like
LAKE PLACID will be let down.  Is it a surreal and light dramedy like
`Ally McBeal'?  That's closer.  Reality:  MYSTERY, ALASKA is simply a
grown-up version of THE MIGHTY DUCKS.  Hey, this *is* a Disney film.
     And not a very good one.  The first sixty minutes, which set up the
unlikely premise of the New York Rangers flying to a nowhere
nothing-town in the middle of the Alaskan winter to play a game of pond
hockey, is one of the worst hours of film I've seen all year.
Stonkingly boring stretches broken up by potty humor do not a fun
viewing experience make.
     History would tell us that hockey movies are supposed to be funny.
Disney would seem to argue otherwise, claiming that this Cinderella
story can be played like an Arctic ROCKY.  And maybe it can.  For a
while, I thought MYSTERY was headed into brave new territory  maybe a
cautionary tale about the false pedestals we put our sports heroes on.
     But pretty soon the Disneyfication hits and hits hard, and we've
got the Against-all-odds-David-vs.-Goliath movie on our hands.  And in
its own bizarre way, that's when the movie becomes watchable.  At two
hours flat, MYSTERY, ALASKA is redeemed in its second half only by some
unexpected cameos (that I won't spoil here) and a surprisingly great
game of hockey.
     If you're a hockey fan, you'll enjoy the movie for the game alone.
If not, you're going to find yourself, ahem, out in the cold.
