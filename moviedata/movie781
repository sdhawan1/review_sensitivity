     The pleasure of Shrek is in its gleeful naughtiness, like a kid at 
the dinner table doing disgusting things with food to make a mother 
throw her hands up in mock despair.  The title character (adapted from 
the William Steig book of the same name) is an ogre who revels in 
revulsion.  He bathes in muck, brushes his teeth in slime, and pulls wax 
out of his ears to make candles.  And he wants nothing more than to be 
left alone.
     He's not evil, of course.  When the townspeople make their periodic 
forays with flaming torches into his swamp to slay or capture him, he 
scares them off good-naturedly, but he doesn't hurt them. 
     But things take an unacceptable turn when Shrek's swamp suddenly 
fills up with refugees - Pinocchio, the Seven Dwarfs, the Three Little 
Pigs, and a bunch of other fairytale creatures who have been exiled by 
Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow), a pint-sized aristocrat so nasty 
he tortures the Gingerbread Man by dunking him in milk.  Shrek (Mike 
Myers doing his Fat Bastard brogue from Austin Powers) demands that the 
unwelcome intruders be removed, and Farquaad agrees on the condition 
that Shrek go fetch him a princess bride (Cameron Diaz), who is being 
held captive in a castle in a distant kingdom by a dragon.  Accompanied, 
much against his wishes, by his trusty sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy), 
he sets out to perform the feat and win back his lonely peace of mind.  
And before it's all over, adventures have been had and lessons have been 
learned.
     The story is fun on its primary level, helped mightily by the 
improvisational vocal antics of Eddie Murphy, whose ingratiating Donkey 
rattles on non-stop as he tags along with the reluctant ogre.  It's a 
character not unlike the little dragon he voiced in Disney's Mulan, and 
here the Dreamworks people poke a bit of fun at that by having the big 
dragon who's guarding the princess fall for Donkey. 
     In fact, the Dreamworks people have lots of fun at Disney's 
expense, providing another level of enjoyment for the grown-ups who take 
the kids to see this one.  The displaced characters who invade the swamp 
are clearly refugees from the Land of the Mouse, there is a brief 
send-up of Disneyland's maddening Small Small World attraction, and the 
nasty Lord Farquaad is said to bear a resemblance to Michael Eisner, 
head of Disney and nemesis of Shrek producer and Dreamworks chief 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was once Crown Prince of the Magic Kingdom 
before he and Eisner had a falling out and he was banished under a dark 
cloud.  (Eisner, however, is tall, and Katzenberg is short, so the 
diminutive Farquaad may be directing a wink at his own boss.)
     The writing is clever, although not quite up to Toy Story 
standards, and the animation is accomplished, although personally I miss 
the old style in which drawing was king.  These characters look like 
Play-Doh with bone structure; they occupy some uneasy territory between 
cartoon and real.  What they really remind me of is those old Viewmaster 
slides, where you would click your way through a story on a disc held in 
a red plastic viewer.  But the effects are wonderful, and the story is 
nicely acerbic, and there are none of those treacly Disney songs -- when 
Donkey tries to sing the ogre will only let him hum.  That alone is 
worth the price of admission.

    It stands as a moment one will not soon forget: a giant, green ogre flips 
through the pages of a cliche fairy tale, narrating it with every bit of dull 
inspiration that the story holds.  This leads one to believe that this serves 
as the prologue to Shrek, DreamWorks' second computer animated feature, but 
in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema, a page of this tale serves as that 
ogre's toilet paper.  From this opening moment, one can infer Shrek's defying 
of all expectations regarding it as a standard, Disney-esque fairy tale.  
Although rampant moments of hilarity dot Shrek, the true charm of the film 
lies in the bold elements of friendship, courage, and acceptance, excelled by 
outstanding direction, stunning actor voice work, and most importantly, a 
witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye. 
While Shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward 
adults, positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the 
storyline: Shrek, the previously mentioned ogre, holds a position of absolute 
nothingness within his community.  The jolly green giant meets a fellow 
outsider, known only as the Donkey (his species) who talks, and although he 
remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time, Shrek 
eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their 
common state as outcasts of the world.  The pair team up to retrieve Princess 
Fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful Lord Farquaad, 
learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way.  Their 
friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on, 
exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest 
companion can unquestionably affect someone.  Shrek and Donkey endure as 
supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling 
to each other for support and guidance along their journey.
Courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines: along the 
journey to rescue Fiona, Donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself.  
Whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone, Donkey 
withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment.  
But the yapping Donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant, 
fire-breathing dragon guarding Fiona; either he dies from terror or he 
triumphs with courage.  He wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no 
dangerous situation actually faces him, allowing the donkey to overcome a 
horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them.  Secondly, 
upon Shrek's and Donkey's redeeming of Princess Fiona, the ogre finds the 
princess has plans for whomever saves her: to satisfy her desire for a 
(human) knight in shining armor.  Throughout this storyline, Shrek faces his 
deep, perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine 
how he will reveal his true identity to Fiona.  An ongoing struggle occurs 
between himself and his reluctance of the truth, but eventually, Shrek 
courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to Fiona.  
Children can realize from Donkey and Shrek that fear remains only as 
complicated as one makes it; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something 
in particular, endless possibilities exist.
After the friendships and courage prevail, the three central characters 
at the heart of Shrek must take one more stretch of development: acceptance.  
Surprisingly, Fiona holds a dark secret of her own: due to a spell cast upon 
her years ago, she transforms into an ogre by night.  In this storyline, 
Fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself, and she must realize what 
beauty truly means: to simply act as one's self.  Upon Fiona's learning of 
Shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her, Fiona, knowing that 
acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with Shrek to 
work, gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred.  Any child 
can pull from Fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of 
self-acceptance.  
On the technical side, Shrek triumphs.  Directors Adam Adamson and Vicky 
Jenson pace Shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner, evenly distributing 
the lessons learned by the central characters.  These central characters 
spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie 
Murphy (Donkey), and Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona).  Myers creates his Shrek 
as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin 
color but perhaps his envy of other, "normal" beings.  Murphy succeeds with 
his Donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the 
actor to have off screen.  Cameron Diaz exudes charisma and innocence as 
Fiona, giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters 
in animated films lack.  While the direction and voice work certainly elevate 
Shrek, the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay, 
written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S.H. Schulman.  
The script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer, combining the 
three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike. 
 Capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at 
classic Disney animated features, the fresh and entertaining screenplay 
delivers.  
With Shrek, DreamWorks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg has certainly 
one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on 
for ages to come.  The smaller children will laugh and cheer; the adults will 
laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not.  
A film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own, 
Shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages.

The computer-animated comedy "Shrek" is designed to be enjoyed on
different levels by different groups. For children, it offers
imaginative visuals, appealing new characters mixed with a host of
familiar faces, loads of action and a barrage of big laughs (including
numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances, apparently
a requisite in contemporary family films). For adults, it's a fractured
fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the
kids. All in all, "Shrek" is a snappy ride, although there are a couple
of points I found disturbing.
But first the basics. Based very loosely on a 1990 children's story,
"Shrek" follows several momentous days in the life of the title
character, a rotund green ogre voiced by Mike Myers in that pleasant
Scottish accent he is so fond of using. Shrek is a grumpy fellow living
a solitary life deep in the swamp, until a local nobleman disturbs his
peace.
Petty tyrant Lord Farquaad (take away the "awk" in the middle and you
have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners) owns the land on
which Shrek resides. He proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an Ellis
Island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings
from his castle. As a result, Shrek finds himself surrounded by legends
like the Three Blind Mice, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, the Seven
Dwarfs, and the Three Bears, to name but a few.
An enraged Shrek storms to the castle, only to find Farquaad (John
Lithgow) ready to bargain. Lord Obnoxious wants to become king and the
magic mirror from "Snow White" has shown him the way. All he has to do
is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife. The mirror unveils
three choices in a presentation straight out of "The Dating Game" (when
Snow White is shown, the cheeky announcer purrs, "Even though she lives
with seven men, she's not easy!")
Farquaad selects the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and offers
Shrek a deal: If the ogre snatches Fiona from the dragon-protected, lava
moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the
throne, the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his
grounds. Shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest, accompanied
by a motor-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) determined to make the green
grump his best friend. They finally hook up with the princess, only to
learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet. For the
matter, the dragon offers a few surprises as well.
The movie references a great many other flicks, from "Babe" ("That'll
do, donkey. That'll do") to "The Graduate." But the lion's share of the
jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of Disney. The
public-domain characters made into icons in various Disney films take
their hits  Pinocchio is referred to as a "possessed toy" and when
Shrek spies a sleeping Snow White in his cabin, he bellows, "Get that
dead broad off the table!"  but the biggest slams come when Shrek
visits Farquaad's royal domicile, which closely resembles a certain
magic kingdom, from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of
animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy
tune that sounds a lot like "It's a Small World."
Which brings me to disturbing point number one. I laughed at all the
Disney swipes, but found the mentality behind them a bit sad. The
acrimony between Dreamworks honcho Jeff Katzenberg and Disney big wheel
Michael Eisner is well known. For years the two companies have tried to
sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar
competing productions on the same day. And now we have Katzenberg using
an entire movie to attack his former employer. Here's a suggestion for
the two boys: Grow up! Put the past behind you! There's room in the
sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice, then go to
your rooms!
The other area I found troubling came in the portrayal of Lord Farquaad.
Beyond all the irreverence, "Shrek" actually has a message: People
should learn to look beyond physical appearances, because true beauty
lies within. It's a lovely notion, but the film betrays its own moral by
incessantly taking cheap shots at Farquaad's diminutive stature. Do we
really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people
is acceptable? The pompous, selfish behavior of Farquaad is enough to
make him a target for zingers. Adding short jokes is simply mean.
Still, "Shrek" is a rollicking good time. The computer animation is
mostly impressive (although several key characters look like animated
rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky), the voice
work is strong (particularly from Eddie Murphy), the laughs come fast
and furious, and the moral, tainted though it may be, is a good one. To
trot out a cliché, "Shrek" is fun for all ages. Parents, though, should
remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others
because they are short, tall, skinny, fat, etc. is a bad thing.

Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson. Screenplay by Ted Elliott,
Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman and Roger SH Schulman, with additional dialogue
by Cody Cameron, Chris Miller and Conrad Vernon, based on the novel by
William Steig. Starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz. Running
time: 89 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 27th, 2001.
Synopsis: Shrek (Myers) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in 
the heart of a forest, until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures 
fleeing the rule of the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad agrees 
to relocate the pests, on the condition that Shrek rescues Princess Fiona 
(Diaz) -- whom Farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle. 
Grudgingly, Shrek sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, 
Donkey (Murphy).
Review: One memorable aspect of Disney's "Aladdin" was that it finally 
gave Robin Williams a character -- the Genie -- to best take advantage of 
his comic talents. "Shrek" does the same for Eddie Murphy; ironically, 
though, Murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. All the same, 
"Shrek" does represent Murphy's best comic outing in years, and as Donkey 
he steals all the best lines. For instance, after getting belted with 
pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, 
Donkey soars into the air and scoffs, "Now I'm a flying talking donkey!" 
And despite its many contributors, the script for "Shrek" is full of such 
comic gems. Myers is delightful in more of a straight man role, and 
Lithgow also gets some great moments (watch for a hilarious repartee with 
the Gingerbread Man). "Shrek" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy 
tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful 
knocks at Disney in the bargain. Things do go somewhat astray during the 
film's middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters 
at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the 
movie's greatest strength. But even then, one can always sit back and 
enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here 
represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology.

El gйnero de animaciуn ha constituido una de las formas mбs creativas del
cine en los ъltimos aсos. Los notables avances en las tйcnicas han ido
aparejadas de nuevos caminos de expresiуn artнstica.
En 1995 surgiу la primera pelнcula animada realizada enteramente por
computadora: Toy Story, fruto de la asociaciуn entre los estudios Walt
Disney y la compaснa Pixar. Ahora, llega a nuestras pantallas la nueva cinta
de dibujos animados digitalizada, Shrek, la cual ha arrasado la taquilla en
Estados Unidos con recaudaciones superiores a 230 millones de dуlares,
siendo la de mayores ingresos en el aсo, superando a Pearl Harbor, La momia
regresa y Nбufrago.
Para Dreamworks (el estudio de Steven Spielberg y Jeffrey Katzenberg, quien
fuera el presidente de Disney) йste es el quinto filme de dibujos animados,
tras haber producido Hormiguitaz, tambiйn por computadora; El prнncipe de
Egipto y El camino hacia El Dorado, de dibujo tradicional, y Pollitos en
fuga, de animaciуn con plastilina. De este modo, Dreamworks se ha convertido
en el mayor competidor de Disney en este campo, que hace apenas unos aсos
representaba su coto absoluto.
El resultado en esta ocasiуn es sumamente afortunado. Mбs que un
entretenimiento garantizado, Shrek es una autйntica delicia, un hallazgo.
Combina, con singular acierto, el sentido de la aventura, el humor y los
elementos tнpicos de relatos infantiles, para crear una obra novedosa, plena
de ingenio y cargada de sentimiento y emotividad. Es un original cuento de
hadas por el que desfilan personajes de cuentos clбsicos, como Blanca
Nieves, La Cenicienta, Caperucita Roja, Pinocho, Los tres cochinitos y Peter
Pan, entre otros.
Asн, se erige en un sincero y refrescante homenaje a la historia literaria y
cinematogrбfica del gйnero y es una ventana abierta a la imaginaciуn. Lo
admirable es su capacidad para armar su narraciуn, para ubicar en este
contexto a sus nuevos personajes, salidos de los libros del cartonista
William Steig, dбndole la vuelta de tuerca a las convenciones de este tipo
de historias.
El hйroe que rescata a la princesa Fiona es atнpico: un ogro verde,
irascible, huraсo y de malos modales, que gusta tomar refrescantes baсos de
lodo. Ella ha sido vнctima de un hechizo y su beldad desaparece de noche. El
final feliz, muy vбlido dentro del espнritu del relato, no se darб por la
vнa normal. Triunfarб el amor verdadero pero ella adoptarб en definitiva la
apariencia del ogro "y vivirбn feos y contentos por siempre".
Por cierto, la princesa se revela como una experta en artes marciales, en
una audaz escena que nos remite directamente a ese sorprendente espectбculo
del cine moderno que es The Matrix.
Es notoria la alta calidad que alcanza el dibujo digitalizado en la cinta,
pero lo mбs sobresaliente es la concepciуn de las imбgenes, la precisiуn de
los encuadres y los planos, con los que desarrolla un autйntico lenguaje
cinematogrбfico.
Tras un sуlido planteamiento inicial, el filme decae ligeramente a la mitad,
despuйs del rescate en el castillo. Pero vuelve a retomar con нmpetu el
ritmo que en todo momento atrapa al espectador. La escena final en la que
los diversos personajes de los cuentos cantan y bailan, resulta de
antologнa.
Afortunadamente, en Mйxico la distribuidora uip tuvo el buen tino de ofrecer
la versiуn original en inglйs, con subtнtulos en espaсol, ademбs de la
necesaria versiуn doblada para los niсos. Asн, podemos disfrutar de las
voces de Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz y John Lithgow, pero el que se roba las
luces es Eddie Murphy como el burro, personaje que se ajusta a las
caracterнsticas del actor.
En suma, una obra memorable, un nuevo paso adelante del cine animado que
tantos momentos relumbrantes ha proporcionado en los ъltimos aсos. Una vez
mбs se comprueba que una buena pelнcula para niсos serб siempre una buena
pelнcula para adultos.

So when you're trying to choose a future queen, do you go for 
bachelorette #1 (Sleeping Beauty, who's a real snoozer), bachelorette #2 
(Snow White, who lives with seven guys) or bachelorette #3 (Princess 
Fiona, who has the advantage of looking and sounding like Cameron Diaz 
but who is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon)?  It's a tough choice, 
but Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) finally casts his lot with #3.  Being 
royalty, he doesn't actually plan to slay the dragon himself lest he 
gets his pretty little -- and I do mean little -- body toasted, so he 
delegates the dangerous work to an ugly, slime green ogre named Shrek 
(Mike Myers of AUSTIN POWERS fame), who is aided by a loquacious donkey 
(Eddie Murphy in his sweetest part since he played Mushu in MULAN).  
SHREK, Dreamworks/PDI's second computer animated answer to 
Disney/Pixar's three mega-hits (TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE and TOY STORY 2) 
-- their first was ANTZ -- takes a bawdy approach that pushes the limits 
of its PG rating.  You've probably never thought of using an illustrated 
book of children's fairy tales for outhouse toilet paper, but writers 
"Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Joe Stillman and Roger S. H. Schulman" 
have.  (Don't you love the way that the Writers Guild makes hash of the 
English language in order to ensure each writer gets precisely the 
proper credit?)  Since fairy tale characters are the subjects of the 
majority of the jokes in SHREK, their union could decide to picket the 
theaters.  Maybe you'll be lucky, and your theater will be picketed by 
the three blind mice, who certainly are cute in the movie.  
With its laugh-a-minute, fast pacing, it is hard to pick out favorites.  
One of mine comes from the tortured gingerbread man who boldly cries 
out, "Eat me!"  Another is Princess Fiona's great CROUCHING TIGER, 
HIDDEN DRAGON martial arts moment.  And, yet another comes when Shrek 
tells the donkey, "That'll do, donkey.  That'll do."
The script throws several barbs Disney's way.  (You'll recall that one 
of the three founders of Dreamworks, Jeffrey Katzenberg, used to work at 
Disney under Michael Eisner, who kept referring to Katzenberg as a 
midget.  Reportedly, Lord Farquaad's facial resemblance to Eisner and 
his small stature are intentional and not so subtle jabs.)  Lord 
Farquaad's castle looks like Disneyland, right down to its themed 
parking areas (Lancelot rather than something like Pinocchio) and 
singing dolls ŕ la "It's A Small World."
I've just touched the surface of the comedic ideas that the film 
develops.  I haven't even had a chance to mention the break-dancing pigs 
or the humorous possibilities of inflated snakes.  
Even though SHREK never enters Pixar's rarified league, it is an 
imaginative and side-splitting movie that is a treat for young and old.  
Well, perhaps not too young since the love struck dragon -- she has the 
hots for the donkey -- is actually kind of ferocious when she's burning 
up the joint.  But, bathroom humor and all, SHREK is such a 
good-spirited film that everyone will love it.  My son's sixth grade 
class, who were there en masse at our screening, thought SHREK was 
terrific.  I concur.  
SHREK runs 1:27.  It is rated PG for mild language and some crude humor 
and would be acceptable for just about everyone.  
My son Jeffrey, age 12, who still hasn't stop repeating his favorite 
lines from SHREK, gave the film a full ****.  His favorite part was when 
the donkey talks to Shrek, saying "We'll stay up late, tell manly 
stories and, in the morning, I'm making waffles!"  Jeffrey friend 
Nickolas, age 12, also gave it ****, saying it was "hilarious!"  His 
friend Eliot, age 12, gave it *** and said that he liked the onion joke 
the best.

Once upon a time, there existed a fierce rivalry
between two powerful animation production companies. 
One was called Pixar, owned by a juggernaut known as
Disney whose name has become synonymous with great
animation and storytelling.  The other was a feisty
little startup company known as Pacific Data Images,
headed by Dreamworks.
Their battle began a few years ago when Pixar released
"A Bug's Life" and then Dreamworks/PDI released soon
afterwards the similarly themed "ANTZ."  Both
companies showed that they were capable of ushering a
new era of animation technology and that the public
could look forward to further sparring in the form of
more ambitious releases.  And now with "Shrek",
Dreamworks/PDI has taken their rivalry to the next
level with a film that not only showcases incredible
animation but also pokes fun at the wonderful world of
Disney.
"Shrek" is a lively and disarmingly silly tale of a
misanthropic ogre (voiced by the gleeful Mike Myers
with a Scottish brogue).  He values his solitude, but
becomes especially distressed when fairy tale
creatures wind up in his private little swamp.  The
creatures explain that the mean Lord Farquaad (voiced
by the deliciously malevolent sounding John Lithgow)
has exiled them there.  Our green hero, joined by a
wise-cracking donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy),
leaves to seek out the evil nobleman in order to claim
back their land.
The story itself never approaches the level of awe
that we have for the animation, which incorporates an
added level of detail, light, and texture that has not
been seen before.  The verdancy of the forest and the
meadows that sway in the wind are truly incredible. 
Donkey looks amazingly lifelike with his furry
exterior and ears that reposition itself based on his
emotions.  Extended sequences such as a song and dance
number with Robin Hood and his very Merry Men and an
escape from a dragon's keep is nothing less than
impressive.
There's plenty here to entertain kids of all ages. 
Young ones will like the colorful characters while
older ones will be reminded of their precious youth
when they see the likes of the Gingerbread Man (who
proclaims "Eat Me" when being threatened by Farquaad),
the Seven Dwarves, the Three Blind Mice, and dozens of
others.  Meanwhile, there are lots of humorous moments
derived from references to pop culture (with spoofs of
The Dating Game, The Matrix, and the WWF), but it also
takes great pleasure in teasing the Disney company. 
For instance, Farquaad's city looks very much like the
Magic Kingdom with its parking lots, turnstiles, and
musical information kiosks.  
"Shrek," unfortunately, never musters enough strength
to tell an involved story.  While our lovable oaf
laments that he actually has a good heart and is just
misunderstood, develops affection for the rescued
Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), and learns a
lesson about friendship and forgiveness, the ideas
seemed hollow.
"Shrek" seems more interested in dazzling us with its
animation and funny moments.  We are dazzled and we
laugh, but the cleverest moments occurred outside the
context of the plot.  More noteworthy animated films
such as "Toy Story", "Chicken Run", and Beauty and the
Beast easily outmatched this film's storytelling
muscle.  Regardless, this is a nice offering that will
undoubtedly leave a lasting impression in your mind.

Shrek
Rating: * * * * out of * * * *
Rated PG: mild language, crude humor, some sexual innuendo.
Starring the voices of...Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow.
Directed by: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson
Back in 1998 Dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "Antz". 
The film was critically acclaimed, and went on to gross almost $100m dollars 
at the domestic box office. Again in 1998 they released their traditional 
animated film "The Prince of Egypt" and it named an instant classic, and 
became a huge hit as well. On a winning streak, they released "The Road to El 
Dorado" and it wasn't as big as they hoped, but still did ok, then they had 
the fantastic "Chicken Run" in the summer. Now in 2001 Dreamworks has 
released what I can safely name, one of the top five best animated films.
Shrek (Mike Myers) is about a loving, green Ogre who lives in the woods of 
Duloc by himself. Surrounded by fairy tale characters, he hopes somehow he 
would escape from everyone. The ruler of Duloc is the short, heartless Lord 
Farquaad (John Lithgow), who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale 
creatures, if they are captured and arrested. Of course many of the owners 
turn them in for gold and silver, but one of those creatures is Donkey (Eddie 
Murphy). A regular donkey, except he talks and has a definite attitude, after 
his owner tries to disown him, he escapes into the woods, and runs into 
Shrek. Lord Farquaad however, has different plans and makes all the fairy 
tale creatures in the woods near Shrek's house. To get his property back, and 
his life back Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so Lord 
Farquaad can be a king. Shrek wants his property back, but he never thought 
he would fall in love with Princess Fiona.
"Shrek" is such an amazing film, that while watching it you can't help but 
just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't 
make movies like this. The animated graphics are so great, that they look 
every bit of realistic. I saw previews for this film all last year, and I 
thought to myself wow, what a great movie this will be. I must say I was not 
disappointed at all, and the film is the best of 2001 so far, and will go 
down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year.
The voice talents are brilliant as well, with the comic genius Mike Myers. In 
the past he has been a Wayne, an Austin, and a person married to an ax 
murderer. Now he is Shrek, not only does he do the voice talent...but he IS 
Shrek. With his Irish accent, and he lovable personality, Shrek becomes a 
friend to the audience and warms your heart.
Eddie Murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "Mulan" does another bang 
up job here, and he is the comic relief in the film. The tones of his voice, 
the lines he utters, and the jokes he gives, he even outdoes the comic genius 
of Robin Williams in "Aladdin". The always beautiful Cameron Diaz gives the 
voice of Princess Fiona and she does a great job as well. She is very funny, 
and her character fits her to a T. Of course the best supporting voice is 
John Lithgow, who is personally one of my favorite actors. He as the bad guy 
Lord Farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same 
time.
At times I was so amazed by the computer graphics, that you can't help but 
just start looking at backgrounds. There is many hidden jokes in the film, 
and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera. "Shrek" is a 
definite kid film, but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire 
family to enjoy. There are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't 
get, but the parents will be laughing. Believe me though, everyone will be 
laughing the entire way through.
In the end, "Shrek" gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy 
and be who you are. Everybody out there is beautiful in their own way, even 
though it may be inside. There's not many words that can praise "Shrek" 
enough, but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie 
now.

Once upon a time a solitary ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) was really annoyed
to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice, seven dwarves
and all the other fairy tale characters in the land, banished from their
home by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).  Unwittingly befriended by a non-stop
talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek travels to Dulloc to speak with Farquaad,
where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner.  His prize?  To save 
Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and 
protected by a dragon so she can become Farquaad's bride.  The ogre agrees to 
the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in "Shrek."
It took four writers (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio ("The Road to El Dorado"), 
Roger S.H. Schulman ("Balto") and Joe Stillman ("Beavis and Butthead Do 
America")) to adapt William Steig's children's book.  The bad news?  They've
genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of
William Goldman's "The Princess Bride."  The good news?  There's so much
wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this
movie should keep you in stitches.  
We get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of Farquaad's
men, intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'Five schillings for the 
possessed boy!' after observing Dreamworks' rendition of Disney's animated 
Pinocchio.  Meanwhile within the castle walls, a gingerbread man being tortured
by Farquaad spits icing and yells 'Eat me!' before breaking down and solemnly 
asking 'Do you know the muffin man?'
Shrek, a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears, is a grumpy recluse who
really yearns to fit in (although who could put up with his habit of making
candles from his own ear wax?).  Donkey is a hyperactive, endearingly stunted
creature who can talk and, therefore, believes will make a great misfit pairing
with the uncooperative Shrek.  Donkey proves his worth sweet talking the
princess-guarding dragon.  The Princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat
after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been
expecting.  When Fiona's true colors are exposed (including opportunies for
some tomboyish gross out humor), a spark develops between her and Shrek.
The script's details are gleefully impish, constantly poking fun at Disney 
from the theme park world of Farquaad's Dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and
'It's a Small World' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which
meets a most un-Disneyish fate after duetting with Fiona 'Snow White' style.
Popular culture is represented with film references to "Babe" and "Charlies'
Angels" via "The Matrix." 
Myers chooses his 'So I Married an Axe Murderer' Scottish brogue for Shrek
in order to give his voice some heft.  While this may prove distracting for
anyone familiar with that film, overall it works more than not.  Eddie Murphy
steals the show as the fast-talking, Motown-singing Donkey, proving once
again his talent as a vocal performer (is it another wink at Disney that 
Donkey is paired with a dragon, a creature Murphy portrayed in Disney's
'Mulan?').  Lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious, height-challenged
villain Lord Farquaad.  Diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing 
Princess Fiona.  (A better choice would have been Minnie Driver, who's proven 
herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as Disney's 
"Tarzan," "Princess Mononoke" and the "South Park" movie.)
The computer animation looks terrific (particularly Donkey), although it
won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of Pixar's work ("Toy Story," "A
Bug's Life," "Toy Story 2").  In keeping with its hip style, pop music
is used, which like Myer's voice may be initially jarring, but ultimately 
satisfies (while surveying bridal candidates via a 'Dating Game' parody 
broadcast by Snow White's Evil Queen's mirror, Farquaad is told 'Fiona 
likes pina coladas' - cue Jimmy Buffet!).
"Shrek" has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group
in the family.  While it may be derivative of the 1987's "The Princess Bride,"
"Shrek" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't
suffer in the comparison.

Most of the 89 minutes of the computer animated SHREK are a delightful 
lampoon of fairy tales.  The trouble is, SHREK ends up following the same 
sanitized formula at which it had been thumbing its nose.
DreamWorks SKG has translated William Steig's children's book into a slick 
story to hold the attention of today's audiences.  It's really a clichéd 
tale, when you think about it  an outsider in the form of the big green 
ogre Shrek( voiced by Mike Meyers, with a Scottish, who wants his privacy 
back when all kinds of storybook characters, evicted from their abodes, show 
up in Shrek's part of the forest; Shrek takes a sidekick (the Donkey is 
voiced by Eddie Murphy, by far the best voice actor in the movie) and 
commences a quest to find Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).
Sound familiar?  Needless to say, you can see the ending from across the 
forest, even through  all of the trees.
There are lots of good things SHREK has going for it, though.  Worthy 
satires have creative villains, and John Lithgow pulls the bad guy off 
wonderfully here  Lord Farquaad is a little stump of a man with a pompous 
voice  he even has fake legs into which he inserts his own short ones when 
he rides his horse.  And something grand happens to him at the end, as well.
There's a moment of absolute sick hilarity, when Fiona has a seemingly sweet 
whistling duel with a smiling birdie.  When it tries a pitch as high as 
Fiona's, the camera pans away and we sense the bird has exploded!  What 
happens to the three eggs in its nest?  Fiona fries them and serves them to 
Shrek and Donkey!  SHREK is at its best when it tries to emulate the spirit 
created by POLITICALLY INCORRECT BEDTIME STORIES.
Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson pace the story well enough, and 
use the animation for all kinds of delightful effects.  I would recommend 
seeing SHREK if you ever were a fan of Mother Goose, The Brothers Grimm; 
alas, if you are a fan of Disney films, you will not be disappointed at the 
end, but you will have to sit through some archly funny moments.

It took three years and over 275 artists and computer geeks to bring Shrek
to the big screen, and the PDI/DreamWorks (the peeps who made Antz) film
kicks off with a crappy "modern rock" song that was popular, oh, about three
years ago ("Hey now/you're an all-star/pull your pants down/you lame-o").
It's hardly an auspicious start for something that, on the surface, looked
like it could have been one of the bright spots of the summer release
schedule.
Luckily, things - including the music (there's a new Eels song and a Bob
Dylan cover) - get much better.  Shrek, based on William Steig's book, is a
quality production, from its appearance to its voice work and even to its
laughably predictable story.  It's the first feature-length film to showcase
computer-animated human characters, and, while it seemed creepy and
distracting in the trailer, it's really incredibly detailed and enjoyable.
The film's main character is the titular Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, Austin
Powers), a big green ogre who loves his privacy and lives in an isolated
swamp far away from just about everybody.  With both the accent and rotten
teeth of a Scotsman, Shrek is often besieged by gangs of torch and
pitchfork-wielding men intent on either driving him from his home or,
possibly, from the face of the Earth (it's a kids' movie - their motives
remain unclear). But Shrek can usually scare them off simply by raising his
voice a bit.  He is, after all, an ogre.
Shrek's dream lifestyle comes to a screeching halt one day when his swamp
becomes overrun with fairytale characters that have been banished from a
nearby kingdom.  Everyone from the Little Gingerbread Man to the Three
Little Pigs have nowhere else to go after being given the boot by the
diabolically short Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow, 3rd Rock From the Sun), a
man intent on creating the perfect empire over which he shall rule like a
king.  To do so, Farquaad is told, he needs to marry a princess, and we see
him as a contestant in a very amusing animated version of The Dating Game.
Farquaad settles on Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, Charlie's Angels), who is,
like every decent princess should be, locked away in a dragon-guarded tower
as she eagerly awaits her first kiss.  Because Farquaad has Short Man's
Syndrome, he has decided it would be better to get someone else to rescue
the princess and bring her to him.  Enter Shrek, who is willing to do just
about anything in exchange for the removal of Pinocchio and Goldilocks from
his piece of land.
Shrek, along with the wisecracking donkey (Eddie Murphy, Nutty Professor II)
he reluctantly befriends, sets off to slay the dragon and rescue the
princess, who, of course, turns out to be the foxiest animated babe since
Lara Croft.  It comes as no surprise that Shrek and Fiona fall in love, but
the princess' dark secret is a nice touch, helping kids learn that whole
moral about books and covers.
The film gives nods to everything from Babe to The Matrix (the latter is
getting kind of boring, but the Shrek folks get some slack because this film
took so long to make).  Shrek and company even run into a spoof of
Disneyland, one of two jabs at producer Jeffrey Katzenberg's former employer
(the other, apparently, is that Farquaad looks like Disney's Michael
Eisner - the ultimate inside joke as the average viewer has no idea who he
is, let alone what he looks like).
Myers is a pleasure to listen to, as his Shrek is essentially a toned-down
version of Austin Powers' Fat Bastard (his accent was thicker, but test
audiences didn't care for it).  There was also some tweaking with Diaz's
character, but more for her appearance than her voice.  The original
versions of her Fiona looked too realistic, and they, too, were revamped for
the benefit of the audience.  One thing that wasn't kicked down a notch is
Murphy's Donkey, who plays a brasher version of his Mushu from Disney's
Mulan and steals just about every scene.
Shrek is full of jokes about farting, earwax, bad breath and body odor, and
I'll bet you my right arm that the same critics who have blasted every film
released in 2001 for containing the same kind of humor will be raving about
how good Shrek is and how it's perfect entertainment for the entire family.
It is, but cut Freddy Got Fingered and Tomcats some slack, will you?

A world in which all fairy tale creatures co-habitate with humans, Shrek 
(Mike Myers) is a lonely, green ogre whom everyone fears. Living in a quaint 
cottage by a swamp, he is distressed to discover that the fairy tale 
creatures, including the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, The Three 
Bears, the Three Blind Mice, and Pinocchio, have all been rounded up in his 
backyard, under the direct orders of Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). In an 
attempt to get his land back, Shrek journeys to the theme park-like castle in 
the town of Duloc to talk to Lord Farquaad, with blabbermouth Donkey (Eddie 
Murphy) in tow. Since Lord Farquaad can't become King until he marries a 
princess, he agrees to give Shrek his land back, in exchange for rescuing the 
feisty Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who is locked away in another castle, 
guarded by a fire-breathing dragon, and bringing her back to him.
The second computer-generated animated film from Dreamworks (with the first 
being the disappointing 1998 movie, "Antz"), "Shrek" is a dazzling display of 
creative artistry and sheer imagination. With animated characters never 
looking so flesh-and-blood before (at least until "Final Fantasy" is released 
later this summer), the movie is nonstop candy for the eyes, with a palette 
of bright colors jumping off the screen, and a round-up of central characters 
who are not only likable, but also memorable and enchanting. 
With a PG rating, for some admittedly racy material for a family film, 
"Shrek" is an ideal viewing experience for both children and grown-ups alike. 
There is humor throughout that kids will be able to thoroughly enjoy, but 
also a constant slew of jokes that will have the adults rolling (if my 
theater of mostly over-15's is any indication). When Lord Farquaad, for 
example, is deciding on a princess to marry, he is presented by the Mirror 
from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" with three contestants, a 'la "The 
Dating Game"--Cinderella, Snow White, and Fiona. About Snow White, the mirror 
says in its best TV-personality voice, "...and although she may live with 
seven men, she's not easy!" Fiona, meanwhile, "enjoys sipping pina colatas 
and taking long walks in the rain." And when Fiona is the lucky winner of the 
contest, the song, "If You Like Pina Colatas," bursts onto the soundtrack. 
"Shrek" is the funniest animated film since Trey Parker's outrageous, R-rated 
1999 feature, "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut."
Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, and screenwriters Ted Elliott and 
Terry Rossio, based on the children's book by William Steig, delight in 
showing off their fast, zippy, satirical dialogue, and have a lot of fun 
playing with fairy tale conventions. Nearly every fairy tale creature you can 
think of makes some sort of cameo here, as does the actual Disneyland theme 
park, cleverly disguised as Lord Farquaad's living quarter. Another 
rib-tickling moment comes when the Gingerbread Man is being tortured by Lord 
Farquaad, in an attempt to get information out of him. With Lord Farquaad's 
constant taunting and his own leg torn off and lying next to him on the 
baking sheet, the Gingerbread Man sarcastically exclaims, "Eat me!"
The voice work from all four principals is wonderful. Mike Myers develops 
Shrek into a lovable ogre who is tired of being feared, and just a little bit 
lonelier than he outwardly appears. Eddie Murphy is hysterical as Donkey, an 
ass who can't ever seem to shut up, but forms a nice friendship with Shrek. 
Cameron Diaz cleverly gives Princess Fiona a bit of punch by portraying her 
much like her butt-kicking, live-action character in 2000's "Charlie's 
Angels." And John Lithgow also amuses as the very short Lord Farquaad. 
Remarking about the monstrous size of his castle, Donkey proclaims, "A castle 
that big must mean he's compensating for something."
Aside from a ten-minute section at the start of the third act, in which a 
misunderstanding between two characters brings added conflict, and briefly 
turns the movie into a tedious one, "Shrek" is a fabulous, unadulterated 
entertainment, and comes back just in time for a winning finale. Word is that 
there are already plans for a "Shrek 2," and that's fine with me. There is a 
great deal of unchartered territory that this first picture doesn't even 
begin to scrape, and undoubtedly more adventures for Shrek to go on. Whatever 
the case is with the rumored sequel, one thing is for sure: "Shrek" is a 
magical film not to be missed on the big-screen, by anyone. A new animated 
classic has been born.
