     Short description: Not much of a movie, but it make a nice bookend to go
with COCOON.  Well, everybody comes back from the first movie (*everybody*), and
a lot of them think about whether it was a good idea to leave Earth in the
first place, and one of the cocoons gets picked up by an oceanographic research
institute where Courtney "Assault Dimples" Cox works, and...
     Brother, is there a lot of padding in this film.  40 minutes could have
been cut out and nobody would have been the wiser.  Yes, some of the charm of
the original is still there, but it's either strained or canned from COCOON.
There are some really ridiculous plot holes running around (especially
regarding how security for the alien is handled -- Carl's Rent-A-Cop guarding
extra-terrestrials).
     *Sigh*  After the Christmas season so far, I'm having to put all my hopes
on THE NAKED GUN...  the local radio promos have been hilarious: "LESLIE
NIELSON as Virtue Incarnate!  PRISCILLA PRESLEY as Lust Personified!  RICARDO
MONTELBON as Pond Scum in Human Form!"  "You've heard the ad...  now see the
movie!  Then buy the silverware."
