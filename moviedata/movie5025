Welcome to the tiny hamlet of Verplank, NY, where everyone drives a Yugo with
vanity plates.  (If you drove a Yugo, would you want to advertise the fact?) 
The most hated woman in town, Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), just took a fatal
plunge into the lake.  The cause:  cut brake lines.  Suspects?  There's her
husband Phil (William Fichtner) who's having an affair with waitress Rona Mace
(Jamie Lee Curtis).  Or her dimwitted son Jeff (or Jeph, it's spelled one way
on his vanity plates and another on his key chain) (Marcus Thomas) who lost his
right hand to Mona's anger.  How about Jeff's partner Bobby Calzone (Casey
Affleck)?  Jeff and Mona were destroying his landscaping business.  Don't
forget Bobby's fiancee Ellen Rash (Neve Campbell); if Bobby's business sinks,
so does her future.  Sorting it all out is Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny
DeVito), Ellen's father.
That seems like a promising set-up for a murder mystery, but the clues are
painfully obvious to interpret.  However, the inscrutable Chief Rash seems slow
to see the connections.  Screenwriter Peter Steinfeld rejects suspense in his
quest for quirky humor.  Sometimes he hits the target, more often he misses. 
Steinfeld also sacrifices the believability of characters.  He seems to plot
the movie by asking at each juncture "What's the goofiest plot twist I can
throw in here?" rather than "What would this character do here?"
The cast works hard to make the deliberately odd script work.  Neve Campbell
was especially good.  She seems to have been invigorated by being a character
actor rather than the lead.  William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas are funny as
the survivors of the dysfunctional Dearly family.  In the numerous flashbacks,
Bette Midler plays a bitch-on-wheels with verve.  The weak link is Casey
Affleck, whose character is more or less the protagonist in this ensemble.  I
couldn't decide whether Affleck was a really bad actor or just giving a good
performance as the timid and awkward Bobby.  Either way he was painful to
watch, and I kept hoping he'd drown.
Bottom line:  "Drowning Mona" really wants to be "Fargo," but it never comes
close.  However, despite the one glaring exception, the stellar cast makes a
superb effort and manages to wring some laughs out of it.

Cast: Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Casey Affleck, Jamie Lee Curtis, Neve
Campbell, William Fichtner
Director: Nick Gomez
Writer: Peter Steinfeld
Ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his,
or her, sophistication? It's full of stops and starts and usually, the
punch line is ruined. I felt the same way watching Drowning Mona. Skip
a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at
an ensemble comedy.
There are some slightly successful attempts at humor, but they only
serve as window dressing. There is a running gag about the town,
Verplanck, N.Y., being a test town for the then new Yugo. Everyone
drives a Yugo, differentiating their cars with personalized license
plates. Even the Police chief drives one. There is a certain
sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out Yugo
skittering its way through the town streets. There also is a running
gag about one of the characters, Jeff,  missing a hand and how it
occurred. It pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends. It turns
out the truth is more horrifying than any legend. There are some sight
gags that pop up as well, such as Mona's tombstone, which
reads "demoted", instead of devoted. Still, The core of the story
maintains the flatness of a still pond.
The lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes
involving Mona (Midler). Each scene with her is the same: scream at
someone, hit someone, then scream some more. There's no uniqueness or
modulation to her or explanation for her meanness. Anyone off the
street could have played the role, such as it is. The other characters
are walking cardboard cutouts. Each one is defined by one trait and no
further attempt is made at deeper characterization. There is a burly,
female car mechanic, so of course, there is a forced lesbianism gag.
Mona's son, Jeff (Marcus Thomas) is a simpleton, hence you can predict
his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth. Chief of
Police Rash (Devito) likes Broadway musicals and loves his daughter.
There's nothing more to him.  Elle, the chief's daughter (Campbell), is
bland personified, a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to
have a child and be married. Mona's husband Phil (Fichtner) Jeckle and
Hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch. Bob (Affleck), Elle's
betrothed, and business partner to Jeff, is a mumbling, obvious
dullard. There is no contrast to any of the characters. By having at
least one character with some wit, or wits, to serve as counterpoint to
the others, perhaps Steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town
infested with ambitionless people might have come off better.
Ostensibly a murder mystery, Drowning Mona gives you almost all the
clues immediately, then lets you sit back and feel superior as you
watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer,
who could be anyone due to Mona's loving manner with everyone on town.
Even that aspect of the film fails, throwing in a convenient,
ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things.
It's been a while since I walked away from a movie theater in an angry
mood. What makes it all the more remarkable is that I rarely remember a
comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it's ineptitude.

Have you ever known someone who was so detestable that everyone hated him?
Imagine if that person was murdered, who would the suspects be, everyone?
Now, imagine if someone, we'll just call him Nick, were to make a movie
entirely about a person like this; what kind of movie would that be?
Apparently, it would be a movie called "Drowning Mona", one of the most
despicable, mean spirited, evil little movies I have ever seen. The only
thing that saved this movie from a one star rating, was the presence of
Danny DeVito as the only likable character in a movie filled with abhorrent
people. "Drowning Mona" managed to cause me to stare, slack-jawed and
horrified at the screen during its full running time. There aren't too many
films out there which can do that.
Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is an evil, loathsome creature, whose life is
filled with caustic remarks and hate-filled glares. Her husband, Phil
(William Fichtner), is a depressed looking man who makes it through life
only because of the happiness he finds in his affair with Rona (Jamie Lee
Curtis), a local waitress. Then one day Mona's brakes fail while driving
along a mountain road, and she flies into the river. Of course, everyone in
the town is suspect: Her husband; her one handed son, Jeff (Marcus Thomas);
his business partner, Bobby (Casey Affleck); Bobby's fiancee, Ellen (Neve
Campbell); and a slew of other people all had plenty of reason to want Mona
Dearly dead. Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), the local sheriff, must try to
determine who the killer might be out of the hundreds of possible suspects.
It's only March, and already a candidate for worst movie of the year has
arisen. Seldom have I seen a movie audience so silent during a comedy. On
those rare occasions where I was able to tear my eyes from the horrors on
display, I would glance about to see other audience members staring at the
screen with looks of shock plastered on their faces. "Drowning Mona" is an
amazingly evil, twisted movie, which nearly gives "Very Bad Things" a run
for its money as most disturbing film of the past five years. Not only is
the movie evil, but its attempts at actual humor fall completely flat. I
think that "Drowning Mona" was supposed to be a dark, dark comedy, but it
succeeds only in being very dark.
Perhaps most terrifying of all is that the actors involved appeared to be
having a grand old time acting like Yugo driving demons (everyone in the
film drives a Yugo). Bette Midler is amazingly convincing as the queen of
this hell on earth, and her fellow stars, particularly Marcus Thomas
("Palmetto"), are very nearly as loathsome. The running gag with Thomas
involves him having a stump for a left hand (pretty funny, huh?). Thomas's
character, Jeff, does wonderful things such as run over his neighbor's dog
with a lawnmower and hit on a thirteen year old girl. I think this was all
supposed to be funny, but if that's the case it failed miserably. DeVito
plays the only fully likeable character here - the sheriff with a heart of
gold. The truth is, DeVito can't help but be great in any moive, no matter
how otherwise terrible it might be ("War of the Roses", for example).
"Drowning Mona" is a waste of both talent and time. I wouldn't wish it on
anyone except perhaps Nick Gomez and Peter Steinfeld for creating this heap
of garbage. I'll grant you, the two men must have talent because it takes
some to create a film so thoroughly revolting. The film runs 95 minutes,
which is about an hour and a half too long. I don't recommend it to anyone,
anywhere. If you're really desperate to see Bette Midler in something new
(and I mean desperate enough that you're going to die without seeing her),
I'd still suggest you wait for video or at least catch a matinee. With any
luck, "Drowning Mona" will be out of theaters in a few weeks. I give this
sorry movie one and a half out of five stars.

Don't let the ads fool ya, folks...the main star of this movie is none other
than Ben Affleck's baby brother, Casey. Sure Jamie Lee Curtis' big boobs
look good bouncing up and down in the trailer, of course Neve Campbell and
Bette Midler will bring in their respective demographics, and surely the
inclusion of ol' faithful, Danny DeVito, will bring to mind many other
funnier comedies of which he's been a part. But the one character that
really drives the story is little ole Casey, and I for one, enjoyed his
performance...and his cute, little teeth! Oh, and the movie you say?
PLOT:
Mona Dearly is a woman hated by practically everyone in this quaint, little
hick town. Fortunately for everyone, she dies in a car accident early on in
this film...well actually, t'was no accident...Mona's brakes were tampered
with. Unfortunately for everyone, the local police are on the hunt for the
murderer, with no less than everyone in town targeted as a suspect.
CRITIQUE:
A fun, diverse cast, some solid laughs, many other chuckles and smiles don't
take away from the fact that this movie lacks the consistent humor to
sustain a crowd filled with angry, young whippersnappers looking for an
all-out comedy fest. The movie starts off strong with plenty of successful
jokes, a bevy of colorful characters (most of whom just act dumb and goofy)
and a cool premise which rapidly establishes the murder mystery as the
film's prime source of business. But ultimately the film doesn't gather much
steam, lulls from point to point, and basically just bounces around from one
decent joke to another lame one and then back again. So why am I still
recommending it? Well, the cast is quite a hoot with every member firmly
grinding their teeth into their backdoor roles, and some of the one-liners
were pure hilarity ("You snooze, you lose"). Well, you had to be there.
Actually, the film's great cast is one of the things that holds it back from
even greater success, since its 90 minute prescription is barely enough time
to truly get to know any of them real well. It felt like there was a lot of
potential in the cast, the premise and some of the jokes, but in the end,
the story and the laughs just seemed to come up a little short.
Danny DeVito was one of the standouts in the cast, playing an excellent
straight man in a town full of ninnies. Others in the cast weren't so lucky,
with Jamie Lee Curtis and Neve Campbell playing deadbeat parts that didn't
necessarily seem to require their specific talent. And despite her early
departure from the film, Bette Midler gives us some superb mean-spirited
shtuff via the consistent flashback sequences sprinkled across this movie.
And then there's Casey Affleck. Yes, Casey...not Ben. Here's a dude whose
probably best known for his dinky "friend" role in his brother's GOOD WILL
HUNTING movie, but here he is coming through as the nice, little, naďve dude
with a heart. Of course, his bleach, blonde awful haircut helps him look
cute and innocent, but all the same, thumbs up for little brother. And last
but certainly not least, let's not forget to mention the pathetically funny
character portrayed by William Fichtner, who kicked mighty ass in last
year's GO as the cop with a penchant for homosexual innuendoes, and does
another credible job as the sad-sack, loser husband in this one. All in all,
the film might provide some of you with the type of entertainment that
you're looking in your night (some laughs, quick runtime, easy story), but
it could also disappoint many others. I would offer a stronger
recommendation for viewing this film on video, or simply advise you to lower
your expectations for this movie, and try to enjoy it for all of its
smaller, better points which include a solid cast, plenty of laughs that do
work, and well...the fact that Bette Midler is killed in it! Happy now?
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actor William Fichtner only got his first role in the movies in 1992, when
he played a cop in Spike Lee's MALCOLM X. His next role only came about in
1994, when he portrayed a stage manager in QUIZ SHOW. Since that time, his
movie roster has been much more active, including turns in STRANGE DAYS,
HEAT, CONTACT and ARMAGEDDON. He began his career as a soap opera actor
starring in AS THE WORLD TURNS for about six years (1987-1993).
Actor Marcus Thomas, who plays Bette Midler's idiot son Jeff in this movie,
was born in Brussels and raised in Switzerland. He moved to America in 1992
and attended the prestigious Strasberg Institute for a year. This film is
his first big break.
This film is writer Peter Steinfeld's (no relation to Jerry Seinfeld...hehe)
first produced movie screenplay.
In order to purchase the required dozen or so Yugo cars for the filming of
this movie, the producers had to actually do a search on the Internet to
find dealers that still sold the models. They were lucky enough to find two
who actually still had them-one in New York and the other in Denver. Living
up to their reputations as the lemon of the automotive industry, the cars
needed their own set of handlers to tune prior to each scene.
Danny DeVito isn't merely one of the stars of this movie, he is also one of
its executive producers. This is the third acting collaboration between
Bette Midler and himself, who previously starred together in RUTHLESS
PEOPLE, a film in which they only shared one scene (just like this movie),
and GET SHORTY, a film which never showed them on the screen at the same
time.

Nick Gomez's "Drowning Mona" displays an ensemble of interesting and 
inventive characters in search of a sharper, more focused screenplay than the 
one they have been given. Hand it to the bright, exciting cast for giving it 
their all (and they are all obviously having a blast with their roles), but 
the script, by Peter Steinfeld, aimlessly wanders around between them, not 
knowing where it is going, and resting its rooting interest on the tepid 
whodunit plotline.
Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is the most despised wench living in the small 
white trash town of Verplanck, New York, which was the testing site years ago 
for the Yugo car company. When she is unable to put on her brakes and flies 
right over the cliff and into a watery grave in the opening scene, suspicions 
are aroused by Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) when he learns the brake lines 
had been intentionally cut. Soon, everyone even remotely related to the 
maniacal Mona is a suspect, including her husband Phil (William Fichtner) and 
her son Jeff (Marcus Thomas), both of which hated her as much as everyone 
else. Jeff is landscaping partners with Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck), who 
was consistently verbally and even physically battered by Mona, and he is 
about to marry the pretty, tough-spoken Ellen (Neve Campbell). Having an 
affair with both Phil and Jeff is Rona (Jamie Lee Curtis), the 
straightforward waitress at the local diner, who also may or may not have 
killed Mona because she wanted Mona's family to herself.
At just 91 minutes, "Drowning Mona" feels drug out, and one of the reasons 
for this is that the film always seems like it is finally going to take off 
with its story, and in the interactions of the Verplanck inhabitants, but it 
never truly does. Occasionally, there will be a spark of wit and originality, 
as when Rona and Phil, meeting at their usual hotel room for a tryst, use the 
"Wheel of Fortune" game as foreplay. But more often than not, the humor just 
isn't edgy enough to work the way it should, and at least one of the 
detractors of this is its bothersome PG-13 rating when it very well could 
have been R, and probably a whole lot funnier. That isn't to say the film has 
no laughs; one scene, in particular, drove me to tears, and I missed the 
whole next scene because I couldn't get over the previous one. Too bad the 
laughs are relatively few and far between.
Advertised as one of the major stars of the picture, Bette Midler actually 
only pops up sporadically, and even then it is only for a minute or two each 
time, via flashbacks that are supposed to present her as this evil woman, but 
fails. Sure, she has a hot temper, but she doesn't seem all that bad, and in 
the one good flashback sequence Midler is given, Mona loses at a 
knife-throwing contest and expresses her frustration for not ever being a 
winner at anything in her life. Otherwise, Midler is sorely underused, but at 
least better than she was in the recent stinker, "Isn't She Great."
Of the rest of the cast, only Danny DeVito is disappointing, not because of 
his performance, but because his character is the one that gets very few 
funny things to say. The high points are most certainly Neve Campbell, who is 
shaping up to be a promising major talent in Hollywood, if only she starts to 
choose her projects a little more wisely (her upcoming Sundance hit, "Panic," 
co-starring William H. Macy, is a good start), and especially Jamie Lee 
Curtis, who it is nice to see again after not appearing in a feature film in 
over a year. Curtis joyously gets right into her character, and the film 
always gains the most mileage out of her appearances. And Will Ferrell, as a 
balding mortician with a taste for taking kinky pictures of scantily clad 
women in his backroom, demonstrates his sheer comic timing to his few scenes.
Undoubtedly made on a limited budget, the cinematography, by Bruce Douglas 
Johnson, is particularly flat for a wide-release motion picture, and after 
seeing his 1997 misfire, "Illtown," and now the superior, but still not very 
good "Drowning Mona," it is safe to say director Gomez is never going to be 
winning any Oscars. Relying on the performances alone, try as they might, 
they simply cannot withhold the weight of the film all by themselves. 
"Drowning Mona" has promise, and it has occasional flare, but for the most 
part, it is a string of missed opportunities.

Say what you will about Ben Affleck, but one cannot deny that he has
screen presence.  The same, however, cannot be said of his younger
brother Casey, who is given his biggest opportunity to step out of his
Oscar-winning sibling's shadow in _Drowning_Mona_.  But his flat
performance isn't the only thing that contributes to this dark comedy's
overall lack of color.
_Mona_ is an ensemble film, but Affleck's character, mousy landscaper
Bobby Calzone, is given the greatest amount of focus.  He is a suspect in
the murder of the ironically named Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), who was
anything but dear to Bobby, who was involved in a business partnership
with Mona's dim son Jeff (Marcus Thomas).  Then again, Mona wasn't dear
to anyone but herself, hence just about everyone in her small town of
Verplanck, New York is a suspect: Jeff; Mona's philandering husband, Phil
(William Fichtner); Phil's mistress, Rona (Jamie Lee Curtis); and Bobby's
fiancée, Ellen (Neve Campbell), who happens to be the daughter of Police
Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), the leader of the murder investigation.
Among this group are a couple of interesting characters.  Making notable
impressions are Campbell, who displays a surprising comic flair; Will
Ferrell's mere facial expressions are good for a laugh as a creepy
undertaker;and Midler, who is deliciously nasty in her few flashback
scenes.  But much attention is paid to those considerably less
interesting, namely Bobby, who is made even more bland by Affleck's
opaque, inexpressive performance.  It's not that he had to hype up his
portrayal; after all, DeVito does a quietly effective job in his
straight-arrow part.  It's just that he forgets that even the most
"normal" of characters still has some personality, and he doesn't give
Bobby any.
But Affleck isn't entirely to blame the drowning of _Mona_; writer Peter
Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez do a good (bad) enough job of it on
their own.  There a few funny scenes and a biting one-liner here and
there, but they are outnumbered by the groaners.  Steinfeld does pack in
a couple of interesting twists along the way, but his story is ultimately
done in by a too-contrived resolution, which ends what is supposed to be
a dark comedy on an overly pat and sunny note.  Then again, the latter
can be said about the entire film; it's supposed to be dark and
mean-spirited, but it never goes beyond a somewhat dark shade of grey;
perhaps the PG-13 rating held more sinister--and possibly
funnier--instincts in check?
Regardless of the rating, however, one would expect a comedy to be
funny.  _Drowning Mona_ is that, but only on occasion.  The rest of the
time, the film relies on bad wigs (sported by nearly every cast member)
and references to cheap Yugo cars for laughs.  It's hardly surprising,
then, that _Mona_ goes down in a heap long before Mona takes her plunge
from a cliff; the real fatal crash happened back in the writing stage.

          In this comedic whodunit, Bette Midler plays a despicable,
foul-mouthed woman whom any number of people had both a desire and a
motive to murder. So, when her yellow Yugo has a problem negotiating a
curve and ends up plunging off a cliff into a lake near her hometown
of Verplanck in New York's Hudson Valley, the chief of police (Danny
DeVito) suspects foul play. Indeed, he discovers her brake lines were
cut. But who is the culprit?  Is it her long-suffering, battered
husband (William Fichtner)? What about her belligerent, moronic,
one-handed son (Marcus Thomas) or his handsome business partner (Casey
Affleck), whom happens to be engaged to the police chief's daughter
(Neve Campbell). Or could it be the town's most promiscuous waitress
(Jamie Lee Curtis)?  Other suspects include the local auto mechanic
(Kathleen Wilhoite) who specializes in Yugos, a cop who scolded Mona
for speeding (Peter Dobson), and a snoopy neighbor (Tracey
Walter). Screenwriter Peter Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez
shamelessly pilfer Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble With Harry and
Murder on the Orient Express, tossing in plot twists and nasty red
herrings which tend to fall flat in the midst of the tasteless mess
that should have been a wacky farce. Whodunit? Who cares? On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Drowning Mona is a floundering 4.  And
Bette Midler played this type of odious oddball once before - remember
Ruthless People?

Phil Dearly (William Fichtner) and Rona, The Waitress (Jamie Lee Curtis)
are having an affair.  At their usual hourly motel for the week's
assignation, they quickly start to strip for a hot game of Wheel of
Fortune.  Enjoy the moment for this is about as funny as Nick Gomez's
DROWNING MONA ever gets.
Peter Steinfeld's script calls for a cast of thousands -- all suspects
in the murder of Phil's wife, Mona (Bette Midler).  Meant to be an
Agatha Christie style mystery, the movie is constructed as a series of
loosely-connected vignettes, frequently told in flashback and without
much narrative drive or momentum.  Sometimes cute, the film has trouble
ever working up to funny.
Set in the fictional town of Verplanck, New York, where the first Yugos
were tested, the movie's on-going joke is that almost all of the cars
are old Yugos.  In the first scene of the picture, Mona dies in a car
accident in her son's Yugo, and foul play is suspected.
Mona, the queen of her white trash family, is the town's most hated
resident.  When her family is told of her death, her son, Jeff (Marcus
Thomas), has only one concern -- why she was driving his car.  Jeff
claims that his mom suffered from a "personality disorder" -- not
exactly an original line.  Like most of the local citizenry, Jeff has an
IQ firmly in the double digits.  The running sight gag with him, not
that it's funny, is his stump in place of a hand.
At the center of the circle of suspects is boyishly blonde Bobby Calzone
(Casey Affleck), Jeff's business partner.  Bobby is planning to marry
Ellen Rash (Neve Campbell), whose father is Wyatt (Danny DeVito), the
local Chief of Police.
Although Wyatt seems rather lackadaisically to be trying to solve the
crime, others show no interest whatsoever.  As Wyatt's deputy (Peter
Dobson) succinctly puts it, "Ding, dong the witch is dead -- end of
story."
Like a firecracker that's packed with powerful ingredients but ends up
just fizzling, the movie spurts along until the killer is rather
arbitrarily chosen -- something that could be said of Neve Campbell's
last picture (SCREAM 3).
Have you ever wished that movies featuring a large cast would have
everyone wear name tags so that you could remember the names?  Well,
DROWNING MONA has a solution.  Most of the characters have their names
on the vanity plates on their Yugos.  Cute, huh?
DROWNING MONA runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements,
language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 11
and up.

 My friend Ruth, a die-hard Bette Midler follower, sighed as she
looked at the cinema marquee. "I guess I have to go see 'Isn't She
Great'," she mumbled, with all the enthusiasm people generally reserve
for such statements as "I guess I have to pay that $700 repair bill" or
"I guess I have to have that prostate exam."
 So she got her ticket and sat down with the six other Midler
addicts who had gathered in the theater. Ruth shook her head. "Bette has
just completely lost her audience," she said.
 Ruth is right. Midler, whose name once meant money in the bank
back in the mid-1980s, is now considered a risky Bette by moviegoers.
After a string of big hits ("Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "Outrageous
Fortune," "Beaches"), she floundered for most of the 1990s in such
disappointments as "Hocus Pocus" and "Stella." Even the surprise success
of "The First Wives Club" hasn't been enough to jump-start her film
career, as evidenced by the paltry attendance for "Isn't She Great."
 Now comes "Drowning Mona," which reteams Midler with Danny
DeVito. Previously, they turned "Ruthless People" into one of the
funniest movies of the 1980s. But "Ruthless" had a snappy script and a
sensational supporting cast (Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater, Anita Morris,
Bill Pullman, etc.). "Mona" features Neve Campbell, Jamie Lee Curtis,
William Fichtner and Casey Affleck trying awfully hard to convince us
they're delightfully discombobulated while screenwriter Peter Steinfield
painstakingly spins a comic whodunit that's neither terribly funny or
particularly mysterious.
 As the Mona of the title, Midler is saddled with a two-note
character. Most of the time, she's a shrieking harridan, but once in a
while she stops howling long enough to indulge in whiny self-pity. No
wonder everyone in Verplanck, N.Y. wants her dead.
 When Mona's Yugo goes flying off a cliff into the river, nary a
tear is shed by her neighbors or her family. In fact, Ellie (Campbell),
who's been on the receiving end of Mona's fury, speculates property
values in the community will probably go up as a result. Ellie's police
chief dad (DeVito) is obligated to investigate the death, however, and
the suspects pile up speedily. Ellie and her fiance Bobby (Affleck),
trashy waitress Rona (Curtis) and Mona's slovenly husband Phil
(Fichtner) are among the most likely candidates, although the longer
"Drowning Mona" drags on, the less anyone will care about the
resolution.
 A handful of giggles arise: The chief, a devotee of Broadway
musicals, tries to coax confessions from the locals by asking them to
"imagine you're Annie and I'm Daddy Warbucks, or I'm Auntie Mame and
you're little Patrick."; a local mechanic (Kathleen Wilhoite) who
fancies herself the next Melissa Etheridge quickly composes a
hard-rocking ode to Mona's memory; on one of their dates, Ellie and
Bobby venture out to see a dinner theater production of "Oh Calcutta."
The soundtrack, ripe with such obscure 1970s pop as the Pipkins' "Gimme
Dat Ding" and David Dundas' "Jeans On," is often more amusing than
anything the script can provide.
In short, "Drowning Mona" is the sort of thing that will
probably become a staple on Comedy Central in about five years, resting
comfortably alongside such snoozers as "Once Upon A Crime" and "Who's
Harry Crumb" in the cable channel's line-up.
 But Ruth will undoubtedly show up to see it this weekend,
shaking her head and sighing as she trudges in to pay homage to her
idol. Yeah, sometimes it's tough to be a fan. James Sanford

The gallows comedy, "Drowning Mona," is set in Verplunck, a small town
in New York's Hudson Valley that was once a test market for Yugos. The
national rollout of the chintzy cars proved to be a massive bust, but in
Verplunck, everyone still tools around in the little death traps. The
loser-mobiles are the perfect vehicles for the citizens of this weird
burg. With its motley assortment of backstabbers, cheaters, connivers
and other ne'er-do-wells, the community serves as the Bizarro Mayberry;
a petri dish of colorful yahoos that could provide Jerry Springer enough
guests for a year or two.
Opening day reviews of "Drowning Mona" were overwhelmingly negative,
with most critics slamming virtually every aspect of the movie. Count me
in the minority. While noting various problem areas, I was too busy
laughing to worry about them much. "Drowning Mona" may be a mess, but
it's a funny one.
It begins with the demise of Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), who plunges to
a watery death when the brakes on her Yugo fail to work. Laid-back
police chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) soon learns that the car had been
sabotaged and launches a murder investigation. Narrowing the suspect
list proves a difficult task  Mona was a monster widely hated
throughout the community. In the matter of Mona's murder, any number of
Chief Rash's friends and neighbors had motive enough to whack the
harridan.
While the whodunit fuels the storyline, the real payoff in "Drowning
Mona" comes from studying Verplunk's low wattage luminaries. There's
jittery Phil Dearly (William Fichtner), Mona's battered husband (among
other things, she smacked him in the head with a frying pan) who has
been carrying on an affair with Rona Mace (Jamie Lee Curtis), a sexy
waitress at the local diner. His son Jeff (Marcus Thomas) is another
creepy piece of work. The surly boob lost a hand under mysterious
circumstances (we're shown several possible scenarios for the
mutilation, all involving him reaching for a beer at the wrong moment)
and is widely known for being almost as mean as his mother. While
working as a landscaper, he once mowed down a client's cat  literally.
Jeff's business partner, Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck), was another
frequent recipient of Mona's fury. The blond, blandly polite kid divides
his time between trying to rid himself of Jeff, and working out details
for his upcoming wedding to Chief Rash's daughter, Ellen (Neve
Campbell), a feisty redneck used to getting exactly what she wants.
As far as colorful characters go, I've barely scraped the surface.
There's self-assured auto mechanic Lucinda (Kathleen Wilhoite), freaky
funeral director Cubby (Will Farrell), nosy old coot Clarence (Tracey
Walter, who plays a very similar role in "Erin Brockovich"), Chief
Rash's dumb cluck officers, led by the preening Feege (Peter Dobson) and
many others.
Writer Peter Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez juggle their large cast
well, making it surprisingly easy to remember each player in the
ensemble. Still, several of the more intriguing characters are sketchily
drawn and woefully underused. Steinfeld and Gomez treat "Drowning Mona"
as if it was one episode in a TV series, focusing on a few characters
for this installment while planning to highlight other cast members in
later shows.
The writing is just as uneven. A running gag about lovers using a "Wheel
of Fortune" board game as part of their sex play never takes off, and
the plotline, which reveals the identity of the killer far too early,
loses steam towards the end.
Still, the film is still funny. Beyond the obvious jokes lies an
absurdist sensibility that leads to a number of wonderful off-the-wall
moments. I won't spoil things by recounting them here, but one strong
example occurs when Bobby spots Jeff leering at a young girl and
exclaims "Come on, man, she just turned 13!" Jeff immediately replies,
"Finally!" Tasteless? You bet, but it still left me howling.
The cast has a great time playing the local yokels. Bette Midler gets to
strut her stuff in raucous flashbacks (unfortunately, the filmmakers
include one ill-conceived scene that softens the character, failing to
realize that for Mona to work, she needs to be as vile as humanly
possible). William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas make an effective
father-son pair, Danny DeVito nicely underplays his role and Neve
Campbell whoops it up as a hillbilly debutante. Jamie Lee Curtis,
Kathleen Wilhoite and Will Farrell also make indelible impressions,
despite being given scant screen time.
If you're looking for a comedy with finesse and good manners, "Drowning
Mona" is not for you. But if you simply want to laugh a lot and don't
mind a considerable amount of nastiness, feel free to ignore the
consensus and join me in the critical minority. I welcome the company.

Starring Bette Midler, Casey Affleck, Danny DeVito, Jamie Lee Curtis,
Neve Campbell, William Fichtner, Marcus Thomas. Directed by Nick Gomez.
Rated PG-13.
Drowning Mona is a weak, underrealized, inconsistent comedy that has
enough little throwaway gags to keep us interested but not much more to
sustain our constant involvement. It's dark, often meanspirited but
it's laughs don't originate in its pitch-black tone. Instead, the few
moments here worth savoring are the goofier, more light-hearted ones.
Does that make the movie a failure? That depends on your tastes.
The film opens with a scruffy-looking Bette Midler getting out of her
trailer to go somewhere. She realizes she doesn't have keys to the
right car, so she is forced to take her son's. As she's riding along
she comes to a hairpin turn that, if not maneuvered around correctly,
can lead to a car plunging into a lake. She slams the breaks, but they
don't work. Down, down to a watery grave.
Via flashbacks we find out that Midler's character, whose name was Mona
Dearly, was not a well-liked lady. She was, in fact, a violent bitch
who delighted in hitting people with frying pans and other blunt
objects when they did the slightest thing to piss her off. This leaves
the town detective (Danny DeVito) with a problem: who cut Mona Dearly's
breaks? Everyone, it seems, had a motive. Was it Mona's husband
(William Fichtner)? Her idiot son (Marcus Thomas)? A mild-mannered (or
is he) young enterpeneur who's had his share of encounters with Mona
(Casey Affleck)? Or could it be Mona's husband's mistress (Jamie Lee
Curtis)? All of the above?
The problem with Drowning Mona is that it's consistently unfunny. Is it
offbeat? Yes. Entertaining? Sometimes. But only on a few occasions does
it inspire as much as hearty chuckles. The movie is dark, yes, being as
it deals with the murder of a woman whom everyone wanted dead, but its
mood rarely translates into laughs.
That being said, rookie screenwriter Peter Steinfeld has a couple
moments where he shines. These are throwaways; they don't make the
movie, but at least they assure that Drowning Mona is worth a rental.
Example: two policemen approach a suicidal man. He desperately
yells "Don't come any closer, sheriff!" referring to DeVito. The
policeman with him yells "No! He's not a sheriff!" That was one of the
only times I laughed with this movie rather than at it.
Considering the big name cast, the performances here are, to my great
shock, merely serviceable. Bette Midler is good at playing a bitch, but
she has so little actual screentime she isn't on enough to really make
a difference. Casey Affleck is annoying as hell, using a shrill, high-
pitched voice for some reason I don't understand. Neve Campbell isn't
the brightest light bulb when it comes to satire and she makes it quite
evident with her dull, one-sided performance. The one actor who rises
above the crowd is William Fichtner, who's quite good at playing a
slimy, unsympathetic bastard. And since that's what all of the
characters sans, maybe, DeVito's are supposed to be, I wish all the
actors involved in this project were as good as Fichtner at what the
script asked them to do.
It's hard to hate Drowning Mona. Some of it is done well, especially
the uncharacteristically cheery musical score that accompanies some of
the proceedings. But there is not enough here. Not enough laughs, not
enough plot, not enough good performances. This is an interesting
failure, but a failure all the same.

Director-Nick Gomez
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Destination Films - 03/00
`Drowning Mona', an oddball black comedy cocooned inside of a murder
mystery, is the second star-laden comedy feature to be released this
week. The first was `What Planet Are You From?', a ribald alien sex
farce with Garry Shandling and a barrel of humming genitalia jokes. Both
movies fail to reach the initial promise indicated by their hilarious
cast and premise, but one of those two components still buoys the bubbly
`Drowning Mona' to a docile altitude that makes it difficult to dislike.
First off, let's discuss the premise. A `horrible tragedy' has
blindsided the denizens of Verplanck, New York - a small town labeled as
the `Yugo capital of the world'. Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), possibly
the most reprehensible woman to ever live, has driven her Yugo off a
cliffside and drowned in the Hudson River. Upon closer inspection, it
appears that Mona's brake-line was tampered with and her fateful plunge
into the water was no accidental incident. But everyone in town is a
suspect, because even Mona's closest relatives thought she was a
miserable wench.
I know. It sounds pretty grim. But then there's the real fundamental
element of `Drowning Mona': the cast, which foams relentlessly with
comic talent and adds a cheery loft of innocent gullibility to the shady
proceedings. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) and daughter Ellen
(Neve Campbell) are among the only mentally competent residents in town
- save for Ellen's sweety-pie fiancee Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck).
William Fichtner (`Go') is Mona's careless husband Phil, who is having a
secretive affair with Rona the waitress (Jamie Lee Curtis), while
one-handed son Jeff (newcomer Marcus Thomas) ceaselessly pesters Bobby
about their mutual landscaping business. Rounding out the cast of
blithering idiots are Deputy Feege (Peter Dobson) and Cubby (Will
Ferrell), the sex-crazed funeral director. While you may believe the
film has its bearings set on a scathing black comedy, the strangely
innocent appeal of the multi-talented cast dilutes the darkened formula
while emitting a sunny charm. Resistance of succumbing to the saccharine
sweetness of `Drowning Mona' is futile.
There is plenty of frustration and lost chances afoot as well. As
written by Peter Steinfeld, `Drowning Mona' has its share of lame,
unfunny comic tedium. There's even a scene in which we are intended to
feel sympathy for the Mona, which generates an awkward and cumbersome
sensation of guilt for the viewer. Steinfeld's script could have
certainly used some `There's Something About Mary'-esque edge and a dash
more of maniacal energy, but the film still has its moments. Like air
pockets of hilarity across a deserted terrain, these wry little
instances of clever humor maintain the giddy playfulness of `Drowning
Mona'. It wasn't funny half the time, but I was still chuckling
throughout. Just pin this guilty pleasure on the diverse cast, who -
from the outrageously brash Midler to the jubilantly nonchalant Fichtner
- are white trash in top-form.
Director Nick Gomez shoots the film much like a smaller, independent
feature - not surprising, given that is his regular field. This approach
is effective, although it lacks the pizzazz to carry a comic ensemble
piece of this caliber overall. Another saving grace is Steinfeld's use
of well-distributed punchlines. For instance, when the police have just
informed Jeff that his mother has driven off a cliff while driving his
car, his immediate response is `What was she doing with my car?' In a
zany, off-kilter sort of way, this type of subtle lunacy is what keeps
the leaky foundation of `Drowning Mona' afloat. It's not the intriguing
murder-mystery portion or the zestful tidbits of black comedy... the
charming little touches help thread this film together. It's interesting
that, in the midst of a puzzling homicide and other gruesome
developments, all you can remember is that a character uses `Wheel of
Fortune' as foreplay, and another puts ketchup on pickles. That's
`Drowning Mona' for you.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     At one point in DROWNING MONA -- one of the strangest, most
frustrating films I've ever been able to sort of recommend as a critic --
small-town cop Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) conducts an interview after the
suspicious death of town witch Mona Dearly (Bette Midler). The interviewee
is Mona's dimwitted son Jeff (Marcus Thomas), who is trying to implicate
his landscaping business partner Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck) by
recounting a confrontation in which he recalls that Bobby shouted a threat
to Mona: "I'll tear out your ovaries!" An incredulous Chief Rash asks
Jeff, "He said 'ovaries?'" "Oh yeah," responds Jeff, "all the time."
     That can't possibly read as funny as it plays, but it's typical of
the throwaway gags that kept me chuckling constantly through an utterly
pointless plot. The premise is that virtually everyone in town -- Jeff,
Bobby, Mona's husband Phil (William Fichtner), Phil's waitress lover Rona
(Jamie Lee Curtis), Bobby's fiancee and Chief Rash's daughter Ellie (Nee
Campbell), even Chief Rash's deputy Feege (Peter Dobson) -- had a motive
for slaying the much-hated Mona. Through flashbacks we see a variety of
antagonizing incidents, many of which may have happened in a completely
different way. The goal would seem to be a broad, dark comedy combining
DeVito's twisted sensibilities, Midler at her most obnoxious and a
well-known everybodydunnit: THROW THE RUTHLESS PEOPLE FROM THE ORIENT
EXPRESS.
     Only the broad, dark comedy is far and away the least interesting
thing about DROWNING MONA. At its best, it's a showcase for the sort of 
giddy, utterly unexpected moments (by screenwriter Peter Steinfeld) that
can make a devotee of great film writing swoon. Due to a test marketing by
the car manufacturer, everyone in the town drives a Yugo (and the service
station helpfully announces "We specialize in Yugos"). A suicidal man's
demand to Chief Rash, "Don't come any closer, Sheriff" is greeted by
another officer's insistent plea, "Wait wait wait ... he's not a sheriff!" 
A funeral parlor's neon sign announces "As seen on TV." And so on.
     Actually, and so on and on and on. Steinfeld is clearly a clever
fellow, but he also doesn't quite know when to quit, or how to keep the
tone jaunty. There are trite scenes involving an alcoholic Catholic
priest, shoulda-been-but-not-quite gags involving a man's use of the
"Wheel of Fortune" board game as foreplay and a misguided scene apparently
intended to make Mona a sympathetic loser (instead of the cackling cartoon
better suited to the story). By the time the final half hour rolls to a
close -- including a forced bit with a lesbian kiss and Tracey Walter
becoming the film's town loony ex machina -- DROWNING MONA has lost a lot
of the bounce in its step, tossing out much of the subversive humor for
chases and exposition (and far too much screen time for Neve Campbell).
     Still, there are those great bits of business that make too much of
DROWNING MONA too much oddball fun to dismiss completely. Plenty of those
bits of business would have worked just as well in any other story, which
makes it a shame that it had to be a wacky farce. Crank DROWNING MONA down
a notch or five, yank some of the bigger stars out of the film and make it
a sly low-budget film (which has been director Nick Gomez's milieu), and
you might have really had something. You have something anyway, something
as smart and weird as it is big and dumb. Maybe it's only a certain kind
of viewer who will enjoy sitting through the big, dumb stuff to get to
big, dumb Jeff sarcastically tapping his thumb and forefinger together,
taunting Bobby by playing "the world's smallest tambourine."

 Every film with Bette Midler should start with her driving off of a
cliff.  It could be a recurring cinematic gag  like when Kenny buys the
farm on each episode of South Park.  Somebody actually suggested that
Midler's new film Drowning Mona would be entertaining because she was
playing a character that was really despicable and obnoxious.  I
explained that Midler has already done despicable and obnoxious five
weeks ago in the atrocious Isn't She Great, and hinted that the
horse-faced diva probably wasn't even acting in either film.
Midler stars as Mona Dearly, a vindictive meanie from Verplanck, New
York, that terrorizes her family and anybody else stupid enough to cross
her path.  When Mona's Yugo takes a swan dive into the Hudson River and
the resulting investigation reveals that her brakes were tampered with,
everyone in the tiny burg becomes a suspect.  Husband Phil (William
Fichtner, Go) is having an affair with a slutty waitress named Rona
(Jamie Lee Curtis, Virus), so they both have a motive.  As does son Jeff
(Marcus Thomas, Palmetto), although I won't say why (even though Mona's
trailer shows it, the film saves it for the big final reel surprise).
Sheriff Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito, Man on the Moon) can't even rule out
his own daughter Ellen (Neve Campbell, Scream 3) or her fiancé Bobby
Calzone (Casey Affleck, 200 Cigarettes), the latter of whom owns a
struggling landscaping business with the lazy, dimwitted Jeff.  As Rash
investigates the crime, the film flashes back to show everybody's
individual beef with the late Mona.  The result is a sloppy whodunit
that tries too hard to be quirky and, instead, is a pretty darn dull
knock-off of Fargo.  Most of the funny parts are shown in the trailer
and, of course, the ending is pretty predictable.  The only surprise in
the film is that Affleck (Ben's brother) has the biggest role in the
film, despite four other names reading above Mona's title.
Mona is another weak big-screen directorial effort from Nick Gomez, who
has done some much better work on television (Homicide, The Sopranos and
OZ), and the paper-thin script was written by first-timer Peter
Steinfeld.  Mona was financed by DeVito's Jersey Films, a production
company the diminutive actor runs with Hollywood cohorts Michael
Shamberg and Stacy Sher.  While Jersey has pumped out some of the best
cinema in recent years (Gattaca, Pulp Fiction and Out of Sight), they're
also creating a disturbing trend by casting their littlest partner in
their projects that are, at best, mediocre (Get Shorty, Man on the Moon
and Living Out Loud).  DeVito isn't in Jersey's upcoming Erin
Brockovich, so you may just want to save your money for that film.
1:30 - PG-13 for some thematic elements, language and brief sexuality

 If you've ever found yourself in a theater watching a movie like THROW
MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN or DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD, then
you'll understand my experience with DROWNING MONA.  DROWNING MONA is
one of those films that you might hear about and shrug it off as a bad
idea.  Then you'll see a trailer and realize that your first instinct
was right.  There is no logical reason for you to ever see this movie.
It looks unfunny, moronic, and you have already crossed it off the list
of all the movies you are potentially interested in ever investing your
time in.  But despite all of that, you somehow end up forking over eight
bucks for the privilege to see it.  And your worst fears are realized.
 Suffice it to say that DROWNING MONA is a bad film.  It is a very bad
film.  Let us count the ways.
 First, there is the plot.  Everybody hates Mona.  Mona gets killed.
And the question is not who did it, but who didn't do it.  As far as
this plot goes, let me just ask, can anybody think of a good whodunit
black comedy?  Hell, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was Alfred Hitchcock's worst
movie.  I'll even go so far as to say that it's simply not wise to
attempt to conjure any sort of comedy out of movies about mean and/or
dead women.  Anyone who has seen either of the two movies cited above
should understand this concern.  In the particular case of MONA, it
seems to be an important element of the plot and theme of the movie that
nobody seems to care who killed MONA.  They are just glad that she is
dead.  Well, I ask, if nobody in the movie cares, then why the hell
would we?
 The second problem with the film is the characters and the acting.  The
actors were actually the reason I talked myself into seeing this film in
the first place.  I mean sure, Danny DeVito and Bette Midler have a
tendency to not discriminate when it comes to scripts.  And they also
have a tendency to sink to the level of their material.  But here we had
Jamie Lee Curtis, William Fichtner, Casey Affleck, and Will Ferrell, all
actors whom I before had thought either had some talent or were at the
very least a little funny.  But none of them pulled it off here.
Affleck particularly, who was hilarious in GOOD WILL HUNTING, turns in a
conspicuously morose performance as the good kid that turns into the
prime suspect.  Fichtner has the sole funny line in the script.
Ferrell, as the funeral home director, trying to pull off yet another
variation of his Saturday Night Live stock character (half shifty, half
outright weird), just can't seem to suck enough out of the script to
generate a single laugh.
 The third problem with the film is the theme, otherwise known as the
point.  To put it bluntly, this movie has no point.
 So just in case your best judgment has left you and you find yourself
standing at the ticket booth.  Maybe everything else is sold out.  Maybe
you feel a sudden compulsion to experience the entire oeuvre of Bette
Midler.  Maybe you're just not thinking.  Please, DO NOT SEE THIS
MOVIE.  If movies like this perform poorly enough at the box office,
maybe we won't be subjected to any more of them.
 That's my public service announcement for the month.  Black comedy is
hard.  Only the select few, like the Coen brothers or Stanley Kubrick
seem to be able to pull it off.  Please note that none of them had
anything to do with this film.
