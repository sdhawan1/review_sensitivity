Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        In adapting a popular television series to the big screen, one must
be careful not to stray too far from the source material so as not to offend
the die hard fans, which is exactly what this past summer's TV-inspired hit
Mission: Impossible managed to do with a single plot twist.  Fans of the
cult cable series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MSTies, as they are called)
need not worry, for in the trip from small screen to big, little, if
anything, of what made the show so smart and funny has emerged unscathed.
        For those of you unfamiliar with the basis of the show, the premise
is simple yet brilliant: mad scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace
Beaulieu) holds average joe temp worker Mike Nelson (Michael J. Nelson)
captive in a satellite in space and forces him to watch some of the worst
movies imaginable.  This thin plot is really just a setup for the heart of
the show, in which Mike and his two robot friends, Crow T. Robot (Beaulieu)
and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) crack wise at the screen, gleefully saving
every awful detail of every awful movie.  This time around the target is the
1955 piece of sci-fi cheese This Island Earth, in which an alien race of
creatures with large heads try to take over earth.
        MST3K: The Movie is just like any other episode, and that's why it
works so well.  The makers of the film--producer-director Jim Mallon,
writers Nelson, Beaulieu, Murphy, Mallon, Mary Jo Pehl, Bridget Jones, and
Paul Chaplin--are also the crew behind the show, and they wisely didn't go
overly big-budget Hollywood with the film.  While the sets are more sturdy
and elaborate, and the wires that control the robot puppets have been
digitally erased, as a whole the film retains the low-budget charm of the
source material.  The look of the film is fairly irrelevant, since the true
"star" of MST3K has always been the writing, and there are far more than a
few good quips here though the commentary is slightly more crude than usual,
with an occasional profane word here or there (shame on you, Tom Servo).
Some critics have knocked MST3K: TM for cutting away from the movie within a
movie for sketches involving the cast, but I like their inclusion here, for
the film wouldn't truly be MST3K without the interludes with Mike, Crow, and
Servo on the Satellite of Love.
        I do have a couple of bones to pick with MST3K: TM, but this is
mostly due to my being a MSTie (#70623, to be exact).  The bouncy opening
theme song, which very succinctly and wittily sets up the story, is sorely
missed, as is the presence of a few players from the television series.  Dr.
Forrester is as wacky and fun as ever, but the character works better with
his dimwitted assistant, TV's Frank (Frank Conniff), who left the series
after the sixth season.  Michael J. Nelson is a very capable and likable
lead, but I always preferred the more dry, acerbic presence of original host
(and series creator) Joel Hodgson.  Gypsy (Mallon), the robot who pilots the
SOL, is thankfully given a greater presence in the film, but it doesn't make
up for the absence of Cambot (which shot the TV show) or the amorphous Magic
Voice.  These two never really played a major part of the show, but it just
isn't quite the same without them.
        The biggest problem of MST3K: TM, in my opinion, is that This Island
Earth, while certainly cheesy and ripe for ripping, isn't as prime cannon
fodder as some of the true dreck the threesome tackled in the television
series.  Mike and the 'bots still have more than enough to work with in This
Island Earth, but since the film isn't _that_ awful, MST3K: TM doesn't
measure up with some the funniest episodes of the series, such as ones in
which they rip the so-bad-it's-good 1975 Joe Don Baker action yarn Mitchell
or, my personal favorite, Pod People, a disjointed, laughably inept '80s
E.T. ripoff.
        The appeal of Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie will probably
fly over the heads of a lot of people--after all, watching three guys making
wisecracks about a bad movie may seem like dubious entertainment for
some--but it is a fast (only 74 minutes) and very funny treat that will go a
long way in converting those who _do_ get it into new MSTies.

It was a rainy Friday afternoon in Columbus when I persuaded a friend
to see a matinee performance of MST3K:TM. He had never seen any
episodes of the show, and I have watched a scant few, due to its
unsocial airtime on Comedy Central and the uneven nature of many of
the episodes.
For those of you not familiar with the premise, Dr Clayton Forrester
(Beaulieu) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film
ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public. To achieve
this, he (in the words of the TV series' theme, which is missing in
the movie) "bumped [Mike Nelson (Nelson)] on the noggin and then shot
him into space", and is monitoring Nelson's reactions to the movies he
is forced to endure. Rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many
of the movies, Nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help
of his two robot companions, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot. The format of
the show consists of Nelson, Servo and Crow making their comments
while silhouetted against the movie being watched, and breaks every 20
minutes or so for segments set on the Satellite of Love, the ship on
which our heroes are marooned.
Only two things are different in the movie: the absence of Forrester's
sidekick, TV's Frank, and the slower pace of the jokes. This latter
change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing
some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke. For
their big screen outing, the producers have chosen "This Island
Earth", a 1954 classic, and one of the first SF films to have a
special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill.
Unfortunately for that film (but making it ideal MST3K fodder), acting
and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which, by
today's standards, are less than impressive. Nelson & Co. make jokes
about everything from Japan's dominance in the world market, to Star
Trek, to the state of disrepair of Seattle's Kingdome, and most of
them work. Unfortunately, the segments set outside the satellite's
movie theater seem out of place and aren't particularly funny, but at
least they're fairly short.
The big question about this movie though is: Why? I presume it was an
attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series
(rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the
plug was eventually pulled a few months ago), but the format gains
nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special
effects to dazzle you, no action sequences to keep you on the edge of
your seat, and no use of digital surround sound. So, it seems
pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few
months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3, and not
have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts.
Nevertheless, MST3K:TM provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than
any film you're going to see this year, and I thoroughly recommend it
to anyone with a pulse. Given its uniqueness, I hesitate to grade it
against other films, but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of
"unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad
B-movies" it does well.

Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996) **** out of ***** - Cast:
Michael J. Nelson, Trace Beaulieu, Kevin Murphy, Jim Mallon.  Directed By:
Jim Mallon.  Running Time: 73 minutes.
Big screen version of the cult favorite TV series from Comedy Central.  If
you are unfamiliar with the show, here's the basic premise: Mike Nelson and
his robot friends are trapped in space and forced to watch really bad
movies.  To make the film more tolerable, they talk throughout the film,
making lots of jokes and obscure references to a number of different things.
For the big motion picture version they are forced to watch "This Island
Earth", a horrible 50s sci-fi flick (which surprisingly many film guides
rate highly).  There are only minor differences between this film and the
series: it is funnier than most episodes, it runs a little shorter, the
segments in between the watching of the film aren't done as well as on the
show, and it is rated PG-13, which allows for a little use of language,
but nothing too shocking I assure you.  And be sure to stay tuned through
the final credits.
For some ridiculous and completely stupid reason, Comedy Central cancelled
the TV show right before the film's release.  Comedy Central is now minus one
quality show.  The show has been picked up, however, by The Sci-Fi
Network.  The Sci-Fi network is run by some very bright individuals.

     What is the worst thing that can happen to you in a movie theater?
Sitting next to a group of people who not only talk incessantly back to
the screen, but who say nothing but inanities and bathroom humor.
Well, welcome to your worst nightmare, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000:
THE MOVIE.
     The movie is based on the increasing unpopular and soon to be
discontinued "Mystery Science Theater 3000" TV series on the Comedy
Channel.  MST3K's format is they take an old science fiction movie and
make fun of it with non-stop jabbering.  The setup is that there is a
mad scientist, Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu), who has Mike Nelson
(Michael J. Nelson) and two robots, Tom Servo (voice by Kevin Murphy)
and Crow T. Robot (voice by Trace Beaulieu), trapped inside a space
station called Satellite of Love.  They are forced to watch old sci-fi
movies, but end up enjoying them.  Mike and his two mechanical buddies
are shown silhouetted in the bottom of the screen talking back to the
movie which occupies the rest of the screen.
     In MST3K there are also scenes without benefit of the old movie.
The laughs here are rare.  The only piece of dialog I like is when Crow
tells the others, "I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus
doing something very stupid, and I decided to go ahead."  Sort of like
what producer Jim Mallon did when he decided to make a feature length
movie of something people had tired of seeing on television.
     The picture Mike and company are forced to watch is THIS ISLAND
EARTH (1954) with Jeff Morrow as the alien Exeter, Faith Domergue as
Dr. Ruth Adams, and Rex Reason as Dr. Cal Meacham.  I have never seen
THIS ISLAND EARTH before and the best part of MST3K is getting to see
it.  The worst part is the non-stop rambling by Mike and the robots.
     I guess I must confess my prejudices.  I watch little television,
and when I have channel surfed past this show in the past on TV, I have
not been impressed.  The concept is fine, but the implementation,
thanks to director Jim Mallon and writers Michael J.  Nelson, Trace
Beaulieu, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy , Mary Jo Pehl, Paul Chaplin, and
Bridget Jones is fatally flawed.  If you run out of ideas for dialog,
admit it and cut back to only the material worth filming.  Moreover,
the characters do not have to suffer from diarrhea of the mouth.  Let
the old film speak for itself most of the time, and then a few jabs
will prove much funnier.
     I can not print MST3K's bathroom humor in this G rated review, but
think of the type of tasteless commentary that a 9 year old might come
up with as vulgar humor, and you get the idea.  In the printable, but
typically bad dialog, we have exchanges like that when Dr. Meacham
flies into Exeter's hideout in the country.  Crow proclaims, "He's
flown into a Flemish painting," and Servo tries to one-up him with, "I
claim this land for Spain."  This is supposed to be funny?
     There were a few members of the audience who laughed frequently,
but most were like me and just stared at the screen.  There are a
couple of funny parts.  One is when Dr. Adams and Dr. Meacham try to
escape from Exeter.  Stealthy they are not, and as Crow puts it, "Let's
slip away in the dark of the afternoon in the biggest car in the
county."  The other occurs during the credits when Mike and his robot
sidekicks hang around to poke fun at everything from people's names to
their titles.  If you think about it, some of the titles people get in
movie credits are pretty esoteric.  Perhaps because they were not
interrupting a better movie, I liked most of their jokes during the
credits.
     If they had taken THIS ISLAND EARTH and perhaps some other films
in this 50s sci-fi genre, they would have had the core of a fascinating
documentary which would have been much better than MST3K.
Alternatively, if they felt they had to stay with this contrived
format, the writers should have drastically limited how often Mike and
the robots should speak.  As it is, I was constantly wanting to scream
at them, "shut up!"
     MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE runs a mercifully short
1:14.  It is correctly rated PG-13 for bad language and gross humor.
There is no sex, nudity or violence.  Given the setup of the film,
there is no reason why they did not make a G or at most a PG show.  The
crudeness of the script detracted dramatically from the quality of the
movie.  Done right this should have been a show fine for my seven year
old.  Thank goodness, I did not bring him.  I do suspect the film will
be okay for most kids over 9 or 10 since by then they are all too
familiar with crude humor.  I do not recommend the film, although loyal
fans of the show will probably enjoy it.  I give it * 1/2 solely
because I did enjoy seeing parts of THIS ISLAND EARTH.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

     Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Craig T. Robot bring their cable-TV
shtick to the big screen in MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE,
though with a substantially less-awful target to take aim at.  The
three, who sit silhouetted at the bottom of the frame, wisecrack their
way through the cheesy 1955 classic THIS ISLAND EARTH.  From sitcoms to
"Star Trek" to DR. STRANGELOVE, their comments come from every corner of
the pop-culture spectrum.  More gags fail than fly, sure, but they all
contribute to an atmosphere of mirth and merriment that lasts the
duration of the film.  You'll laugh; you'll howl.  (Unfortunately, the
other sequences-- those set in the dog bone-shaped space station, where
the characters live, breathe, and watch movies-- are cheap-looking and
largely unfunny.) The best part of MST3K: THE MOVIE is that the humor
lacks either a mean-spirited or condescending edge.  The writers don't
attempt to outsmart the viewer; instead, they invite us to laugh along
with them.  They know, as we do, that bad movies are best heckled at.

The premise is simple, if not bizarre. A mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu as Dr.
Clayton Forrester) launches an average-joe (Michael J. Nelson as Mike Nelson)
into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies
ever made. Why? It's torturous, it's maniacal, and it's just plain fun. Based
on the cult-favorite cable television series, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000:
THE MOVIE isn't torturous, but as for being maniacal and just plain fun, it
foots the bill quite nicely.
Mike Nelson, on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft, spends his days as any young man
would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay, and seeing quite a few
movies. The catch is, these movies aren't the movies he chooses, but retched
examples of film-making chosen specifically by Dr. Forrester in an attempt to
break Mike's will to live. Dr. Forrester is convinced that one too many b-
movies is all it will take to ruin a man, but with a couple of wise-cracking
puppet buddies (Tom Servo, voiced by Kevin Murphy, and Crow T. Robot, voiced
by Beaulieu), the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is
wrong in the world of cheezy cinema.
The purpose behind MST3K is to exploit some of the worst films known (even if
by very few of us) to man. We watch as the silhouettes of Mike, Tom, and Crow
sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them. In
this case, it's the 1954 sci-fi film THIS ISLAND EARTH. We basically watch as
our three leads watch, only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their
hilarious commentary. The plots behind the movies ripped apart are really
quite irrelevant, but for the sake of those who might want to know, I'll
explain this one. THIS ISLAND EARTH is the tale of two scientists, a man and a
woman, who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the Earth.
Together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet.
To make MST3K work, the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible
as possible, and although the TV-series introduced us to several worse films
than THIS ISLAND EARTH, it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical
cruelty. MST3K, which doesn't actually contain the complete THIS ISLAND EARTH,
is a short 73 minutes, but this is a step very wisely taken. As funny as some
of their observations are, it can only go so long. Occasional breaks from THIS
ISLAND EARTH also help the film tremendously. Although it takes a second to
get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment,
it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste.
MST3K lovers will likely hail the film greatly, but if you don't know what
you're in for, it could be a jarring disappointment. Although I thought the
sharp wit of this film was worth three stars, it is a movie to be seen on home
video, late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity
anyway, and with a large, saracastic crowd - New Year's at midnight for
example, which is when I saw it.
Warning: Although MST3K has more to its end credits than most (the three leads
use the credits to poke some more fun), they are actually more annoying than
most. The name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny, and
after laughing for about 70 minutes straight, it put a heavy damper on the
overall experience. Most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's
have to say, but for me, it almost ruined an otherwise good film.

     I guess there are some concepts that don't excel in the translation 
from the small screen to the big one, and MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 
appears to be among these.  The TV series, which started on a 
Minneapolis UHF channel in 1988 before moving to HBO's Comedy Channel in 
1989, provides light, undemanding entertainment for those who enjoy 
lampooning (or, perhaps more appropriately, harpooning) bad movies.  
This new motion picture incarnation, which boasts larger sets but 
essentially the same format, is on par with one of the lesser episodes.  
As a TV diversion, MST3K is thoroughly enjoyable, but, in this new 
medium, it's something of a disappointment.
     For those unfamiliar with the MST3K premise, it goes something like 
this:  a dastardly mad scientist, Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu), has 
decided to conquer the world by subjecting the entire population to bad 
movies.  On an Earth-orbiting space station called the Satellite of 
Love, Forrester tries out his plan on a hapless human guinea pig, Mike 
Nelson, and two robots, Tom Servo (voice of Kevin Murphy) and Crow T. 
Robot (voice of Trace Beaulieu).  Instead of being tortured into 
submission, however, these three actually seem to enjoy the experience.  
Episode-after-episode, they sit in the audience and mock whatever 
"cinematic suppository" Forrester exhibits.  As viewers, we see a movie 
screen showing the picture of choice with a row of seats and three 
moving heads silhouetted against it.
     For MST3K: THE MOVIE, the film-to-be-savaged is THIS ISLAND EARTH, 
a 1954 science fiction embarrassment that could hold its own against any 
other entries in the worst movie of all time competition.  Featuring the 
obscure cast of Jeff Morrow, Rex Reason, and Faith Domergue, the 
chaotic, idiotic plot involves a trip by two Earth scientists to the 
planet Metulana (which, in the words of one of the MST3K trio, looks 
like "THE JETSONS after Armageddon").  Once there, the Earth man and 
woman learn of an intended invasion of their homeworld, avoid becoming 
the victims of a giant mutant insectoid, and join a helpful Metulana 
native in escaping from the dying, bombed-out world.  
     A significant problem with using a movie this deliciously bad is 
that the film generates enough unintentional humor on its own, so it 
doesn't really need the quips and barbs from Servo, Mike, and Crow.  
Although a number of their comments are very funny, THIS ISLAND EARTH 
would have had me doubled over with laughter had I seen it without the 
MST3K format.  Unfortunately, during the course of this film, there are 
several contrived breaks that get the characters out of the darkened 
theater.  During these sequences, without a cheesy flick to inspire 
them, their banter comes across as juvenile.  Such unnecessary and 
pointless padding dilutes the movie's better aspects.
     Die-hard fans will undoubtedly be delighted, but it's more 
difficult to determine how casual viewers will react, especially if they 
realize that they're paying for something that's no better than what's 
available on TV.  In fact, the theatrical environment may stifle MST3K, 
unless you happen to see it in a ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW setting.  By 
its nature, MST3K demands audience participation -- something difficult 
to obtain in a typical movie-watching environment.
     In general, it's easy to praise the ingenuity of the MST3K writers, 
although less for this script than for some of what they have previously 
accomplished.  Motion pictures, no matter what they celebrate or deride, 
should be something of an event (after all, you have to travel to get to 
the theater, then dole out money once you arrive).  In this case, 
however, MST3K: THE MOVIE is routine -- sporadically funny, occasionally 
clever, but routine nonetheless.

Here's a bit of background for those of you unfamiliar with the television
program "Mystery Science Theater 3000" (MST3K). This is an American program
which basically consists of a man and two robots seen in silhouette, making
fun of some god-awful old movie playing on the screen before them. These rag
sessions are divided with little vignettes about the man (named Mike Nelson)
and the robots and their life on this space station.
Wait a second. This is the Internet. Everyone is familiar with MST3K.
So let's cut to the chase. The question is, "How do you make a movie out of
MST3K?" And the answer: "Just show it in theaters on a really big screen."
And the next question is, "Is this any good?" The answer: "It's hilarious." 
The movie of ridicule is THIS ISLAND EARTH - that 50s flick with the famous
bug-eyed, brain-headed alien. As soon as the film started and the wisecracks
began, I was laughing. They were clever, well-timed and one, after another,
after another. I was in stitches right up to the first vignette. After the
break, I had settled into the pattern of the humor and thus didn't laugh as
_hard_. But I still laughed a _lot_ - a snort or "tu-HA!" every 30 seconds
or so.
I had been afraid that the filmmakers might have tried to justify their
big-screen debut with some goofy storyline involving the robots and Mike.
Not the case. While the vignettes in the space station seemed to have
slightly better production values than the TV show, they had little
pretension toward developing a plot. No more than 5 minutes into the film,
Mike and the robots settle in to watch THIS ISLAND EARTH. There they remain,
for the bulk of the movie.
While this movie may simply be an overgrown episode of MST3K, it's the best
episode I've ever seen... although I can't call myself a fan. Since I first
channel-surfed into MST3K years ago, the bits and pieces I've seen probably
total no more than four or five full episodes. But if you don't credit my
assessment, believe the audience. There were more than a few MST3K nuts in
there and they were dying with laughter.
Do you need to see MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE on the big
screen? Of course not. But if you love MST3K, you'll see it in the theater.
I know you will. Just be sure to stick around for the credits; they rag on
them, too.
In case anyone is interested, I also posted this review a few days ago to a
mailing list I run called "Mike's Midnight Movie Reviews." Basically, I go
to advanced screenings for new movies and post a review to the list when I
get home (usually around midnight).
