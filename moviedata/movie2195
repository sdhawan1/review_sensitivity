After such a dismal year that "Castaway" is considered one of its best
films, the release of a Coen Brothers film is certainly cause for
celebration. Luckily for us, this one is near perfect.
No deep messages here, just a collection of hilarious episodes as Homer's
"Odyssey" is overlaid on a tale of a thirties prison break in the deep
south. Exactly what we need during the chilling gray days of January.
With a collection of actors including Holly Hunter, John Turturro, Charles
Durning and John Goodman, it's surprising that George Clooney emerges as the
stand-out. His comedic bits are masterful and his face so rubberized that at
times he appears to be an animated character. This could be Clooney's
break-out film.
There are so many surrealistic scenes (the Klan rally, the sirens, the
Soggybottom Boys and more) that you'll sit slack-jawed during the entire
film amazed that anyone would put these on the screen. And even more amazed
that they work so spectacularly.

You gotta hand it to the Coen brothers. Even with the great success of FARGO
a few years back, they have still managed to maintain their integrity, their
quirky filmmaking nature and their innate ability NOT to sell out. This film
is yet another example of the original work that these guys have been
putting up on the screens for close to 20 years now, with an obvious passion
for their projects and very little priority placed on commercial success.
Don't get me wrong, their films surely pay back their investment and then
some, but much like Woody Allen and his successful streak of films year
after year, the Coen brothers seem to make movies primarily because they've
got a boatload of characters to share with the world, and quirky stories to
divulge. Blockbusters are not what these brothers are about.
PLOT:
Set in the South during the 1930s, three men have just escaped a chain gang
in order to retrieve the treasure which one of them buried before his
capture. On the way to their final destination, the bumbling threesome run
across various colorful characters including a fast-talking one-eyed bible
salesman, a black man who just sold his soul to the devil in return for
musical talent, a trio of sexy sirens, the KKK and many other quirky members
of the Deep South personnel.
CRITIQUE:
Another original piece set forth by the Coen bros, who continue to charm us
with their unique knack for poetic dialogue, quirky characters, musical
melodies and eerily authentic looks at the days of old. And despite this
film being a little slow at times, a little too long for its own good and a
little weak in the "romance" end of the story, it still managed to keep me
entertained for most its outing with plenty of peppered one-liners, a great
chemistry between the three leads, catchy tunes and a rock-solid performance
by George Clooney. Now when the heck did he suddenly become a movie star and
an actor?!? Wow. Here Clooney shines as the leader of this pack of con men,
with a twangy accent in tow, a great delivery of his overly literate
dialogue and a hilarious running gag about his hair. I just could not take
my eyes off this guy when he was on the screen. A great turn for Mr. Clooney
(and a nice Clark Gable-ish 'stache to boot). The other two scoundrels also
follow suit with top-notch performances of their own offbeat personalities
as do the rest of the cast, with plenty of fun and engaging moments of their
own. There was however at least one character for whom I didn't care much.
And seeing as the film did run a little too long, I think it would have been
a tighter flick with a little snip here and there.
But ultimately, much like any other Coen film, you either like it or you
don't. I did and despite many of its characters obviously having graduated
from the RAISING ARIZONA school of highly tuned dialogue (just not as
flat-out funny), I got into it and would recommend it to anyone looking for
something different. This film will doubtfully be a commercial hit because
it simply doesn't have much to say and doesn't entertain on a "general
audience" type of level. Its story isn't a grand one and its over-emphasis
on the use of musical ditties is unlikely to appeal to the masses, but the
film certainly will not disappoint Coen fans and/or anyone looking for a
little variety in their cinematic diet. I for one enjoyed the film on the
whole, thought it could've used a little more structure and one or two less
characters, but appreciated its overall creative outlook. I also can't seem
to get that darn hit song from the movie out of my head, so I guess that's
always a good sign. Love 'em or hate 'em, they're the Coen bros and they're
here to stay.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: (taken from the IMDb)
The title of this movie is taken from the title of the film the director
wants to make in Preston Sturgess' Sullivan's Travels. Homage is paid to
that film via a scene in which a lot of chain-gang members are brought to
watch a movie in a theater.
This film is based on Homer's "The Odyssey" and several references can be
found throughout: The names of George Clooney and Holly Hunter's characters
(Ulysses & Penelope), the one-eyed Big Dan as the Cyclops, the three girls
by the river as the Sirens and the old-man disguises at the end of the film.
Stephen Root, who plays the radio station owner in this film, also played a
radio station owner in the TV show "Newsradio".
The character of Tommy Johnson is based on famed blues guitarist Robert
Johnson who, according to folk legend, sold his soul to the Devil at the
crossroads for his legendary talent.

Directed by: Joel Coen
Written by: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Homer (for "The Odyssey")
Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) just broke free of a chain gang with 
two fellow prisoners, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). 
They plan on heading back to Ulysses' home town to recover 1.2 million 
dollars in stolen money (that's 5 hundred thousand each! Delmar happily 
exclaims) that Ulysses has buried. Little do they know their journey will 
take them through hazards and wonders aplenty. Before their journey ends, 
the trio will have encountered George "Baby Face" Nelson (Michael Badalucco) 
in the midst of one of his crime sprees; three sirens by the river who will 
attempt to seduce our heroes and have a habit of changing some men into 
amphibians; a one-eyed bible salesman named Big Dan Teague (John Goodman); a 
massive Ku Klux Klan rally; a heated race for the Governership between the 
angry Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning), and the jovial reform party 
candidate, Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall); and Ulysses' wife, Penny (Holly 
Hunter), who is getting re-married since Ulysses was conveniently hit by a 
train without his knowing about it. The group will also meet up with a 
guitar player named Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to 
the devil so he could play his guitar masterfully. Along with Tommy, the 
trio records a hit song under the assumed band name of "The Soggy Bottom 
Boys," but they're traveling so much they don't yet realize just what a hit 
it is.
"I never         met a Coen movie I didn't like," I told a friend of mine before 
heading out to see the brothers' latest flick. Even Barton Fink, with 
its plunge into utter nonsense at the half-way mark, kept me quite 
entertained. If you want to view that as a sign that I'm biased toward Coen 
movies and my opinion therefore counts for less than it normally would, go 
right ahead. If you're willing to accept my opinion, then let me sum it up 
this way: I loved this movie. Gee John, what a loquacious description. How 
long did it take you to think that one up? Well I'm sorry my friends, but 
unlike Ulysses Everett McGill and Big Dan Teague, I'm not blessed with the 
gift of gab. Besides, what did you expect me to do, sit here and ramble 
about the sheer beauty of every scene of this movie? Did you think I'd 
babble on and on about how I could watch this movie on mute just to gaze in 
awe at its sheer majesty, but then I'd miss the outstanding and highly 
amusing banter between the characters? That I'd talk about how the movie was 
funny, clever, good natured, and a great time all around? Well, if that's 
what you thought, you were obviously wrong. No, I think the words "I loved 
this movie" will do quite nicely on their own.
I've never fully understood why people like George Clooney so much. He 
always seemed afflicted by Nic Cage syndrome to me. In case you're 
wondering, that means he plays the exact same character with different 
names. This works at times, like it did in Out of Sight, but usually 
fails miserably, as exemplified in the horrendous The Perfect Storm 
and, even worse, in Batman and Robin. Imagine my surprise when I 
witnessed his truly hilarious, frankly Oscar worthy performance as the 
silver tongued Ulysses. I have to admit, this movie has given me a whole new 
appreciation for Clooney's acting talents. Of course, he's supported by a 
host of great actors. Long time Coen collaborator John Turturro is perfectly 
cast as the embittered Pete, while Tim Blake Nelson (The Thin Red 
Line) manages to turn the brainless Delmar into an endearingly naive and 
funny character. I tend to like John Goodman in everything, and though his 
appearance in O Brother is brief, it's quite funny and he's just the 
man for the role. Holly Hunter (The Piano) and Charles Durning 
(I.Q.) are given fairly small roles, but they makes their appearances 
memorable.
Who am I kidding? I feel a burning need to praise this movie up and down; 
but while I won't waste your valuable time doing that, I'll at least provide 
a touch more insight than "I love this movie." Reading the reviews before 
walking into the film, I had this sick feeling that I was about to witness 
the Coens' first failure. "It's dull!" The critics cried; "It's not funny!" 
"It makes fun of the south!" I must have seen a different movie. The one I 
saw may have been leisurely paced, but I was never bored, and I didn't look 
at my watch once. Not funny? Are you kidding me? Curious as to how they 
could feel that way, I went back and looked at a few of their reviews for 
The Big Lebowski (which I feel is the funniest movie of the '90s). 
Sure enough, they all hated that one too. My friends, if you enjoy the 
Coens' brand of quirky, subtle comedy, you'll find this movie to be a laugh 
riot. Otherwise, go watch Dumb and Dumber for the umpteenth time; I'm 
sure it hasn't lost any of its comic genius for you. As for the film making 
fun of the south, I'm not sure just what these critics were talking about. 
There's a little gentle prodding I suppose, but nothing remotely vicious. 
Even the scene involving a Ku Klux Klan rally is played for comedy (Klan 
members dance about in a very funny homage to The Wizard of Oz) 
rather than as an attack on the south for housing such groups. In fact, 
there's nothing remotely mean spirited about this movie. Damnit all you 
nay-sayers, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore.
It breaks my heart to say this, but I can't honestly recommend O Brother, 
Where Art Thou? to everyone. Like most Coen brothers movies, this one 
will only find its way into the hearts of a small group of people; typically 
those society describes as just a little... off. Why is that? Well, because 
it's come to my attention that American audiences tend to like their humor 
as in-your-face as possible (what else can explain the success of Scary 
Movie?), and the humor in O Brother, Where Art Thou? is as subtle 
as it can be. The second, and perhaps most important reason, is that the 
film is leisurely and pleasant. There's next to no action (aside from 
"Babyface" Nelson's bank robbery and car chase); and the film is filled will 
long sequences of the Coens' trademark wide, panning camera shots of the 
beautiful south. Sorry folks, but if that doesn't sound like your cup of 
tea, go catch Guy Ritchie's frantic film, Snatch, instead. It's 
probably best that I mention one more thing which could certainly be seen as 
a flaw. Animal lovers will probably be shocked and horrified at a few scenes 
like one where a toad gets squished, or one where a cow is plowed over 
during a high speed chase. If you're one of those people who can't handle 
the very idea of anything happening to an animal, this will probably disgust 
you. If you're like me, and you can realize it's not really happening to the 
animal, you should do just fine (if you're really sick, like me, you might 
even get a chuckle out of these scenes).
I'm pretty sure someone will shoot me if I don't mention the film's 
soundtrack, and that someone could very well be me. So, here's the 
soundtrack description for ya: it's old, it's southern, it's country, it's 
twangy, and it's brilliant. That's coming from a guy who doesn't normally 
like anything resembling country music. I bought the soundtrack the day 
after I saw the movie, and not just for the outstanding song by the Soggy 
Bottom Boys, "I am a Man of Constant Sorrow." Granted, that song will be 
stuck in your head for days, but the entire soundtrack is simply brilliant. 
>From the Sirens' song, to the beautiful and haunting "O Death", this 
soundtrack makes me wonder one thing: how did this sort of deep roots, 
lovely music give way to the moronic country and pop rock of today? O 
Brother, Where Art Thou? runs a leisurely, gentle 106 minutes, and I 
treasured every moment of it. I'd recommend the film to fans of George 
Clooney since he really shines this time around, and to fans of the Coen 
brothers who will probably appreciate the film's quirky humor. I give the 
movie a much deserved four and a half out of five stars.

O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, an adaptation of Homer's classic tale, "The 
Odyssey," is by none other than the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan.  You 
know, the ones who brought us THE BIG LEBOWSKI and FARGO.  Don't worry, 
there aren't any subtitles, and the adaptation is loose, very loose.  
This version concerns three hayseeds who escape from a Mississippi chain 
gang.  Set during the Depression, the film's imaginative cinematography 
looks like a print left out to bake in the hot Mississippi sun, which 
makes the heat palpable.
The convicts, Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop 
(John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson), might be called 
a bunch of half-wits except that they don't have a whole brain among 
them.  With an angry group of state police chasing them, they are 
heading for some buried loot.  They only have a few days since a new dam 
will shortly flood the area.  If they can get there in time, they figure 
that they can split the $1.2 million among them, giving each of them 
$500,000.
The cat-and-mouse story meanders like a leaf drifting lazily on a 
stagnant pond.  The movie's salvation lies in the eclectic songs and 
music, which feature old-timey gospel and country tunes.  The gang of 
three, calling themselves "The Soggy Bottom Boys," record a hit record, 
which gives them more fame than their criminal exploits ever did.  The 
film uses music heavily, including a magical scene of singing muses 
sitting on large boulders in a river.  This gives you reason to look for 
the music video and the CD of the soundtrack.  It doesn't, however, 
provide you enough reason to see the picture, which lacks one essential 
ingredient, humor.  This is a comedy in which I didn't laugh once nor 
did those around me.
The Coen brothers are brilliant visual stylists, which they amply 
demonstrated in FARGO and do so again in this film.  Many scenes give 
you much to admire, even if not much to like.
"I'm awful pleased my adventuring days have come to an end," Everett 
says at the story's conclusion.  And so was I.  I just wish that it had 
come much sooner and that I had just seen a music video of the film's 
singing finale rather than having to sit through the entire movie.  
O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? runs a long 1:46.  It is rated PG-13 for some 
violence and language and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.

Two dim wits and a fast talker (Clooney) escape from prison in the 
1930's South USA. Seeking a hidden 1.2 million-dollar treasure, the 
police-dodging trio hitchhike from one near-surreal adventure to the 
next. All the while, deeply rich gospel music graces their adventures.
Clooney splendidly rattles encyclopedic phrases off a friendly southern 
accent. His two narrow-eyed buddies are also charming despite their lack 
of brains. Vying between the light and the peacefully religious, "O 
Brother" eventually favors the silly instead of the profound.
Beautifully filmed with carefully scripted dialogue, the production 
almost breaks out into cinema greatness. If only the rich touch and feel 
had been backed up with a stronger knot and substance, this one could 
have been as truly gorgeous as its music. A strong B+.

     The 1941 Preston Sturges comedy SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS told of a
movie director who decided that in the hard depression era, fluffy
comedies just were not what the world needed.  He wants to make a
serious film about the down-trodden in the South.  When the director
sees the real world he discovers what the world really needs is more
fluffy comedies like . . . well, like that Preston Sturges guy
makes.  On to the ash heap go his plans to make the serious and
important film O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  Apparently Joel and Ethan
Coen have decided to make a film called O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?
after all.  In spite of the dour title it seems that neither
Sullivan nor the Coens could resist the urge to make fluff that
belies the harsh setting.
     The plot is simple enough.  We start with a chain gang working
soulfully in the blistering Mississippi sun.  Somehow three men have
managed to escape (as convicts always seem to from cinematic chain
gangs) and are hiding in a cornfield.  They are hobbled by a chain
around their ankles and betrayed by their telltale broad-striped
prison clothing.  There is Everett Ulysses McGill (played by George
Clooney), Pete Hogwollop (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim
Blake Nelson.  The story follows them on a short odyssey into the
poor South past sights and though a series of episodes, some of
which will be drawn together in the final reel.  Along the way they
pick up and then lose a black guitarist Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas
King).  They mix into music, and politics; they see a famous
criminal's getaway, a baptism, and a Klan rally.  In the end they
have multiple whimsical Dei Ex Machinae.  Some of the incidents are
loosely and slightly pretentiously based on episodes of Homer's
Odyssey.  Others are inspired by SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS and perhaps bits
of other films set in the Depression-era South like NIGHT OF THE
HUNTER and FOOLS' PARADE and Davis Grubb stories.
     The Coen Brothers are, of course, some of the most creative
filmmakers going.  This film is released by the unconventional
combination of Touchstone and Universal.  Roger Deakins shot the
entire film with washed out colors to give the film something of a
period feel.  It works, though I am not sure why.  They drop into
scenes 1930s products, particularly hair pomade for the dapper
Ulysses.  They avoided two pitfalls here.  They used no brands
currently available so they respected their film sufficiently to
avoid product placements.  They also avoided that great cliche of
the South, Moon Pies.  One cliche they did not avoid is the
choreographed and slightly too poetic chain gang.  It always seems
like an appeal to social conscience to show men chained up, though
how different is it from children led together through town on a
rope as we see in the latter portion of the film.
     The music by T-Bone Burnett and others becomes an important
element of the film rather than just creating atmosphere for
incidents.  The movie is suffused with the "Old Timey" music of the
period which becomes important in the plot.  There is a repeating
theme of the characters getting into strange circumstances by
following mystical music coming from the woods.  Each time it is
heard the boys will be tested in some way.  Tim Blake Nelson is not
one of the more familiar faces on the screen but manages to stand up
with the more popular Clooney and Turturro, though in the musical
scenes he seems relegated to a distinct third place.  Also along in
much smaller roles are familiar Coen veterans Charles Durning, John
Goodman, and Holly Hunter.
     As a single story, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? just does not
amount to much.  But the individual episodes are entertaining.  I
rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

The Coen brothers are back again, this time with Homer's "Odyssey" as the 
backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a Mississippi chain gang who 
trek across the South to find a secret treasure in "O Brother, Where Art 
Thou?" 
Right for the beginning of "O Brother" the Coens grab your attention with a 
chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a 
work song. The camera flows around the hard toiling men, giving a visually 
exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - Ulysses 
Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John 
Turturro) - escaping across a cotton field. It is the beginning of a 
journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of 
the trio. 
A strong suite, as always with the Coen brothers, is the depth of character 
of the folks they create in their films. Their characters are goofy and 
comical, like Nicolas Cage in "Raising Arizona"; or, dramatic, as Albert 
Finney and John Turturro in "Miller's Crossing"; and, even a mix of the two 
with Frances McDormand in "Fargo." In all cases, and in "O Brother," too, 
the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people. 
Ulysses Everett is a handsome, hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver 
tongue and not a lot in the brains department. But, he seems like a genius 
when compared to the simple, sweet Delmar and the maladjusted Pete, who 
follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1.2 million. 
Their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of Homer's original 
material as they meet all manner of people along the way, including those 
dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a 
Cyclops who beats them and takes all their money. There is magic, too, when 
Delmar believes that Pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens. 
The story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures, 
giving the flick a  choppy, episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow. 
Some of the interludes are an epiphany, though. The trio becomes a quartet 
when they pick up guitar-playing Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) and 
visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere, run by its blind owner 
(Stephen Root). They become the Soggy Bottom Boys for the sightless Radio 
Station Man and, without their knowledge, are recorded as they sing the 
traditional tune, "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow." It is a wonderful moment 
of moviemaking and gives us, in my mind, the best movie song of the year. 
Contrasting this and other wonderful moments (the sexy seduction by the 
sirens comes to mind) are some pretentious bits that detract from the 
overall quality of "O Brother." In particular, near the end, is a scene 
where Ulysses, Delmar and Pete crash a Ku Klux Klan rally to save Tommy 
from being lynched. The scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "The 
Wizard of Oz." They don't say "lions and tigers and bears, oh my!" and 
there's no Dorothy, but it is the Land of Oz we're seeing here. 
The highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several 
levels. George Clooney is funny, charming, a little dumb and one of the 
handsomest actors in the business today. He has the charm of a 30's movie 
idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity. Ulysses 
has an ongoing obsession with his hair, risking life and limb to get a 
particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets. His vanity will come 
to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer. 
While Clooney is the name draw for "O Brother," the show stealer is Tim 
Blake Nelson as Delmar. The heretofore unknown Nelson is terrific as the 
simple convict who, at one point, hears the word of the Lord and joins 
members of a church congregation in their mass baptism. Delmar is saved and 
dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple 
character that makes him shine. The taciturn Pete, as played by longtime 
Coen collaborator Turturro, is the sullen member of the trio and gives them 
the necessary angst. 
All together, the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the Three Stooges and the 
Three Musketeers as they prove to be buffoons, albeit brave ones. 
The colorful supporting cast is rampant with Homerian characters to meet 
and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey. Charles Durning appears 
as incumbent governor Pappy O'Daniel, who keeps crossing paths with them in 
his bid for re-election. John Goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible 
salesman and con artist, Big Dan Teague. Michael Badalucco is manic and 
outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary, George "Babyface" 
Nelson. Stephen Root is amusing as the blind DJ, rep'ing one of the many 
references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways. Holly 
Hunter is wasted in the small role as Ulysses' estranged wife, Penny (and 
the real reason for this adventure, not secret treasure). 
Techs are, as expected in a Coen brothers venture, first class. 
Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has worked on five previous Coen films, 
captures the sultry atmosphere of the South. The photography complements 
the lush period production and costume provided by Dennis Gassner and Mary 
Zophres, respectively. Once again, Roderick Jaynes - the alter ego of Ethan 
and Joel Coen - is on board as editor. 
The high points outweigh the low through most of "O Brother, Where Art 
Thou?" with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and 
traditional music. I give it a B.

O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?
(Touchstone)

Durning, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Michael Badalucco.
Screenplay:  Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, based on "The Odyssey" by Homer.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     In the opening credits of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?, Joel and Ethan
Coen announce that the film we are about to see is "based on 'The Odyssey'
by Homer." They do so with the same straight-facedness they employed when
announcing that FARGO was "a true story," and they are equally full of
crap this time around. True, O BROTHER features a character named Ulysses
Everett McGill (George Clooney) trying to get home to his wife Penny
(Holly Hunter). And yes, along the way he encounters a blind prophet, a
one-eyed beast and a trio of sirens that tries to lure him to his doom. He
also winds up in the company of a Mississippi bluesman who claims to have
sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads, and a bank-robbing gangster
named George "Baby-Face" Nelson. Funny, but I don't remember them turning
up in my Western Civilizations reading list.
     If you really want a sense of what the Coens are after in O BROTHER,
WHERE ART THOU?, it helps to know the origin of the title. In Preston
Sturges' SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, a Depression-era filmmaker popular for his
frivolous comedies decides to hit the road in America to research an
important, significant film story -- a story he plans to call O BROTHER,
WHERE ART THOU? Ultimately, he discovers that people love frivolous
comedies, and that there's no shame in creating them. Forget epics of the
common man; make them laugh, and you've got them right where you want
them, and right where they want to be.
     I'm not sure I could make an argument for the Coens' O BROTHER, WHERE
ART THOU? being flawless film-making. It is, however, the most utterly
demented, unashamedly un-important and purely entertaining film experience
I've had all year. The central plot finds Clooney's McGill fleeing a
Depression-era Mississippi chain gang with fellow convicts Pete (John
Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). They're heading for $1.2 million
McGill has hidden from a pre-incarceration heist, money that's days away
from being sent to the bottom of a lake by a dam project. But that journey
to the treasure takes many turns, during which the three fortune-tossed
men join Nelson for a bank job, become inadvertent recording stars and
wind up in the middle of a floundering re-election bid by Governor Pappy
O'Daniel (Charles Durning).
     Essentially, there's nothing to O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? but a
string of comic misadventures. Coen brothers characters don't often occupy
a particularly moral universe, so there's not really a lesson or point to
any of it. Manic-depressive gangster Nelson takes his Tommy gun to a herd
of cows. The governor's campaign team laments their opponent's clever use
of a midget as a representative of "the little man" he stands for. McGill
shows nearly as much interest in finding his preferred brand of pommade as
he does in finding his loot. It's an exercise in free-form narrative
cinema, held together by the Coens' distinctive whip-smart dialogue and
their gift for putting the right face on every role.
     And it's constantly, gut-bustingly hilarious. Viewers who have been
lukewarm to previous Coen projects aren't likely to become converts this
time around, but if you're in tune with their warped sensibilities, you're
in for a treat. O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is the kind of film you'll
spend most of the time watching with your mouth open, either laughing out
loud or in dumbfounded amazement at what they're able to put on a screen.
And few things are as dumbfoundingly amazing as George Clooney's
loose-limbed comic performance, the kind of work that forces you to
re-think an actor's versatility. From his know-it-all soliloquies to his
performance of the bluegrass standard "Man of Constant Sorrow," Clooney
takes every bizarre situation and runs with it as far as the Coens will
let him. In a cast full of great comics and Coen film veterans (Turturro,
Durning, Hunter, John Goodman), Clooney steals the show.
     It happens to be a joyous show he's stealing. Somewhere creeping
around the edges of O BROTHER is a commentary on our need for religion and
mythology even in an "age of reason," with its combination of Greek legend
and American folk tales. It would be ridiculous, however, to argue that
this is the Coens' personal "Odyssey." It dips and swerves, hits its lulls
then tears back into remarkably goofy set pieces. There's no important
message here, no contemporary re-working of an ancient classic. This,
folks, is film-making that aims for nothing more profound than the funny
bone. This, folks, in all its glory, is frivolous comedy.

     People love it or hate it.  The Times gave it a rave.  
Entertainment Weekly gave it an F and labeled it the worst picture of 
the year. 
     Trust me (even though you should never trust anyone who says "trust 
me"): this is a wonderful movie.  The Coen Brothers have made a slyly 
crafted, joyously eclectic picaresque road/buddy movie drawn from 
sources as diverse as Preston Sturges and Homer, The Wizard of Oz, The 
Court Jester, It Happened One Night, Gunga Din, some Leni Riefenstahl, 
some Busby Berkeley, and maybe even a little Jean-Luc Godard.  Does that 
sound crowded?  It's just the tip of the iceberg. 
     "Based," a title card announces, "on The Odyssey by Homer."  This 
odyssey starts with three convicts escaping a chain gang in the 
Depression-era Mississippi Delta, and setting off after buried loot.  
They're Ulysses (George Clooney) and his dim-witted companions Pete 
(John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Along the way they run 
into a gallery of Homeric rogues -- an old blind seer (Lee Weaver); 
three sirens (Mia Tate, Musetta Vander, Christy Taylor) who lull them, 
rob them, and turn one of them into a frog; a rascally one-eyed Bible 
salesman (John Goodman); Ulysses's wife Penny (Holly Hunter), not quite 
as steadfast and true as her classical counterpart.  Also livening the 
landscape are characters suggesting legendary Delta bluesman Robert 
Johnson (Chris Thomas King); Jimmie Davis, who wrote "You Are My 
Sunshine" and served a couple of terms as Governor of Louisiana (Charles 
Durning); and  a bi-polar Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco).
     This is a musical, and the music is terrific.  The centerpiece is 
the recording of "Man of Constant Sorrow" cut by Ulysses and his 
confederates under the moniker "The Soggy Bottom Boys" at a little radio 
station.  The genius of the Coens is to temper their gleeful 
extravagances with the unwinking straightforwardness of the music, which 
swells on the sountrack with studio values even when it's being sung al 
fresco.
     The movie's title comes from the Preston Sturges classic Sullivan's 
Travels; it's the social message film that Hollywood director Sullivan 
(Joel McCrea) wants to make for the common people when he goes out in 
search of the "real" Depression America, only to discover that the 
common people would rather laugh than be reminded of their misery. 
     The Coens understand that.  Laughter surges through this movie like 
water bursting from a dam.  Some of the scenes may seem a bit over the 
top, but they're really more around the bend.  They're held in line by 
disciplined direction and beautifully-tuned acting.  There's almost a 
quality of down-home magic realism to this movie, a blend of cartoon, 
classicism, and social commentary, expertly filmed in yellowish 
nostalgic tones by Roger Deakins.   Some of it makes little sense 
individually, but there's a perfect sense to it overall.   
     The linchpin to the whole project is George Clooney's remarkable 
Ulysses Everett McGill.  This is a risk-taking Clooney you've never 
seen, a pomaded dandy with raffish Gable looks and a silver tongue given 
to locutions like "It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of 
the human heart."  If you weren't sure before, the jury is now in: 
George Clooney is a first-rate talent.  So are the Coens.  If there's an 
F here, it's for Fabulous.

Do me a favor: the next person that tells you George Clooney is a
talentless, pretty-boy hack, pop 'em in the mouth.  Better yet, take
them to see O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?.  If they ain't convinced by his
magic therein, there just ain't no convincing 'em.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is a down-home, no-place-like-home, road
story, in the vein of one of the first, and best, of them: Homer's epic
poem, "The Odyssey".
In depression-era Mississippi, three rather...confused...convicts -
Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro),
and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) - bust out of the chain gang
they're on in search of the $1.2mil treasure Everett told them he stole.
Everett, a self-made leader who is as concerned with his hair and the
pomade that keeps it slicked as he is with the treasure they're after,
doesn't inspire much confidence in the hotheaded Pete or the somewhat
dimwitted Del; but since he's the best they've got, they reluctantly
follow his lead.  The threesome are cautioned by an old soothsayer (Lee
Weaver) that their way would be fraught with dangers to overcome, but
our three heroes are determined to see their odyssey through.
Along their journey, they come across some situations epic and
not-so-epic, involving Pete's backcountry cousin Wash (Frank Callison)
and son Bog (Quinn Gasaway); Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), a
guitarist at a crossroads in his life; a radio announcer (Stephen Root)
whose "can" allows a surprising outlet for the trio plus one; Homer
Stokes (Wayne Duvall), a reform candidate for Governor who really means
it when he says he represents the Little Man (Ed Gale); a trio of sweet
siren temptresses (Mia Tate, Christy Taylor, Musetta Vander); and many
more creatures, great and small.  The threesome are searching for many
things - including redemption and divine intervention - but, like the
Ulysses of centuries ago, what they want most is to find their way Home.
The Upshot:
Ok, ok, maybe a quick poppin's too drastic [DISCLAIMER: anyone who'd
give someone else a pop in the mouth on my say-so, needs their head
examined.  Go, quickly, and get thyself Healed, for I have no such Power
over thee].  After all, Clooney can't be held harmless for some of the
bad press he's gotten; for too long, he seems to have gotten by with his
sloe grin, puppydog eyes, and Classic Actor looks.  But that's neither
here nor there; in the "Odyssey"-inspired O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?,
Clooney more than holds his own against the likes of Actors' Actors John
Turturro, Charles Durning, and Holly Hunter.
In fact, it's Hunter (Penny) that set in mind the movie that "O Brother"
reminded me most of: the Coens' equally quirky (though somewhat better)
RAISING ARIZONA, in which she costarred with another "Brother", John
Goodman.  "O Brother" survives the comparison; though it's not quite as
"groundbreaking" as "Arizona" was, for my money, O BROTHER, WHERE ART
THOU? is just as much fun.
The treats in "O Brother" came from all sides: for one, while each actor
was given a chance to shine - Clooney and the hilariously deadpan Tim
Blake Nelson, especially - the ensemble effort that the Coen Boys seem
to inspire, was evident.  Within this large cast, from John Goodman's
broad portrayal of conman Big Dan Teague, to Michael Badalucco as George
Nelson, the gangsta who wouldn't accept the name society would deem him
fit to hold, to the multiple "Odyssey"-esque characters in between, the
players built each segment of "O Brother" onto the next, layering its
rich tones along the way.  Second, behind the scenes, the Brothers Coen
worked their magic in a way I haven't seen from them since FARGO (I'd
love to say more, but it'd involve too many spoilers).  I wonder what
they could possibly come up with next to top these two films.
If anyone involved with this dynamite production could be said to be
flat, it would have to be Charles Durning; I've seen his Governor Pappy
act one too many times in similar Good Ol' Boy roles, and it quickly
wore a nerve for me.  And besides, Paul Newman portrayed the Guv'ner
>From Louisiana much more memorably in BLAZE a few years back.
It's quite amazing to find a movie that actually has me anxious to go
back and read old grade school literature [where's my old copy of Homer,
anyway?].  And, the bonus of watching Clooney move in way I've never
seen him move before?  Priceless.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
    And speaking of "Magical Negroes"...
I'll be the first to admit that Lee Weaver, as the old blind soothsayer
who first sets Everett, Pete, and Del off on their adventures, occupies
that archetype; soothsaying, after all, *is* Magical, no two ways about
it.  I'm not sweatin' that role at all; it is as it was *supposed* to
be, so I suggest that anyone who wants to get Up In Arms about it,
should take a pill.
I *do*, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Chris Thomas King's
rather dull portrayal of Tommy Johnson, a role apparently inspired by
the fabled story of blues guitarist Robert Johnson.  But my quibble with
King, I reckon, is one that he could never overcome - because for the
life of me, I can't imagine anyone ever doing a better job at playing
Robert Johnson than the incomparable Joe Seneca, as he did in
CROSSROADS.  Sorry Chris; you never had a chance.
Bammer's Bottom Line
The real test of a greenlighter, for me, is whether I'd want to see the
movie again, if only eventually.  "O Brother" passed that test and then
some - because I was ready to re-watch this flick immediately.  If only
to hear the "Soggy Bottom Boys" work it again.
O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (rating: greenlight):
Just found my old Ancient Lit textbook.  Hmmm.  Uh...anybody got any
cliff notes I can borrow?

 O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (director/writer: Ethan and Joel Coen;
 screenwriter: based on "The Odyssey" by Homer; cinematographer: Roger
 Deakins; editors: Roderick Jaynes/Tricia Cooke; cast: George Clooney
 (Ulysses Everett McGill), John Turturro (Pete), Tim Blake Nelson
 (Delmar), John Goodman (Big Dan), Holly Hunter (Penny), Chris Thomas
 King (Tommy Johnson), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Ray McKinnon
 (Vernon Waldrip), Wayne Duvall (Homer Stokes), Daniel Von Bargen
 (Sheriff Cooley), Stephen Root (Radio Station Man), Michael Badalucco
 (George Nelson), Frank Collison (Wash Hogwallop), Del Pentecost
 (Junior O'Daniel); Runtime: 106; Universal/Touchstone Pictures; 2000)
The Coen brothers have based their latest film on `The Odyssey' by
Homer. Naturally, coming from them, it is a very loose interpretation of
that Greek classic. Comedy-and-old-fashioned bluegrass and gospel music
are what prevails, what gets left behind is the serious poetry of that
epic work. The film is closer to Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels
than it is to Homer. This film even gets its title from the part in
Sullivan's Travels when Joel McCrea, playing a successful director,
wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious
drama called `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'
The scene is set in Mississippi during the height of the Great
Depression, where three chain gang convicts escape while chained
together. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) loves to talk fancy
and vainly thinks he's a smart one, and by the process of elimination,
he's the self-proclaimed leader (Ulysses is Roman for Odysseus). Pete
(John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are dolts and perfect
foils for Ulysses. Pete is easily made a fool of by those who can't
resist how gullible he is and Delmar talks incessantly about getting
back his farm before he can talk about a woman or anything else. The
three of them collectively being dumb-and-dumber-and-dumbest.
The film will display moments of visual splendor and a riot of comedy
coming about through the characterization of the three stooge-like
convicts, but overall the film flags in its effort to make the story
more worthy than a few skits that work.
Since they are chained together, in order to get them all to want to
escape with him, Ulysses makes up a story that he knows where $1.2
million is buried from an armed robbery he committed, which the three of
them call a treasure.
After their escape, they ride away from the nearby prison with a blind
black man (Homer's prophet) driving a railway handcar, who warns them
that they will find treasure out there, but not the treasure they're
seeking.
Seeking shelter with a kin of Pete's, the three are turned in by him to
the sheriff (von Bargen), as he explains these are hard times and I
could use the reward money. But the trio escapes as the place burns down
and the turncoat's kid drives them out of there. The trio will proceed
to get into one adventure after another, as two of them are all excited
about going after the treasure, while Ulysses is more concerned with
tracking down some pomade called Dapper Dan, which makes him smell
pretty and look the way Clark Gable did as a matinee idol. The man with
seven daughters real reason for escaping, is to stop his wife Penny
(Homer's Penelope namesake-Holly Hunter) from marrying a wormy
politician (McKinnon).
On a desrted road, they give a ride to a young black musician, Tommy
Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who says he just sold his soul to the devil
so he could be a great musician, and they decide to go with him into a
rural radio station/recording studio, where they tell the blind radio
manager (Root) that they are a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys. They
cut a catchy country tune and are paid ten bucks each, but tell the
manager there are five of them. They then take off again and are unaware
that the record becomes an enormous smash, with customers requesting the
album that the store owners tell them is all sold out.
On the road again, the three hitchhikers thumb a ride with the excitable
George "Baby Face" Nelson," who is being pursued by the police, with him
firing his Tommy gun from the side of the car at them with tremendous
glee, while also taking time out to kill a cow. After robbing a bank
with him, he deserts them because he feels depressed. Yet, he leaves
them the money from the robbery.
The adventures continue, as the boys are lured into the woods by a trio
of sweet-voiced sirens, and when they wake up the next morning, Pete is
gone. Delmar mistakes the toad in Pete's overalls for Pete. So he
carries the toad around in a shoebox until a one-eyed Bible salesman
(John Goodman as the Cyclops) squeezes the critter to death after
beating the two over the head and stealing their bank money.
The boys run into a heated governor's race that pits the unpopular
incumbent Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) against a fire-brand reform
candidate (Wayne Duvall) whose motto, `Friend of the Little Man,' is
endorsed by a broom-sweeping midget who accompanies him on his campaign
stops.
The major skit in the film, is a wonderfully choreographed Ku Klux Klan
rally that is disrupted by the boys in a comical fashion. The film
reaches its climactic moment, when
they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a
standing ovation by the audience as the Soggy Bottom Boys. Durning comes
to their rescue from his KKK opponent, who snarls at the band for being
integrated. Durning goes onstage with them and pardons them for their
past sins, as he is grateful that his political career has been
reinvigorated by his association with the popular singers.
The story seemed to die when it tried to conclude in some sane way, as
the film was played mostly for the comedy, so the story had no emotional
impact or little complexity to it, even though it lightly touched on
racial and religious issues. There were also several obvious references
to Homer's epic, but mostly it was a film carried by the comedy
performances of the three dimwitted characters, with George Clooney
showing he had an old-fashioned charm, much like the old Hollywood
stars, plus he has a good ear for comedy, and showed that he could carry
a film.
Dan Tyminski did the singing for Clooney in the pic, as the trio sang
the fictional hit "Man of Constant Sorrow."
I was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film (trying to depict
the Depression-era in the Deep South as in the midst of great social
changes due to anything from its music to the TVA--with comedy being
prescribed as a the cureall for everything). It was amusing and fun to
watch, but could never get over its limitation -- a weak storyline.

A weak offering from the Coen brothers will usually still be head and
shoulders above most other films, a point proven with O Brother, Where
Art Thou?.  Compared to any of the Coen's previous films, O Brother just
doesn't measure up.  But since the brothers have consistently made some
of the best films over the last decade and a half, even something that
doesn't seem up to their usual standards can tower over its competition.
O Brother, which is loosely based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' in set in
1937 Mississippi, where a rock-breaking chain gang appears on the screen
after the nifty silent movie title cards used for the film's opening
credits. Three of the convicts (apparently the only three white
prisoners there) escape through a giant cornfield and are quickly
involved in two very funny sight gags because of their still-shackled
feet.
The fast-talking leader of the group is Everett Ulysses McGill (George
Clooney, The Perfect Storm), who orchestrated the jailbreak because only
four days remain before his `treasure' will be underwater. The treasure
in question is from an armored car robbery McGill pulled off some years
earlier, while the "underwater" comment remains somewhat of a mystery.
In addition to the treasure, McGill also has some pretty serious issues
with his hair, which he constantly slicks back with Dapper Dan's Pomade.
McGill's two sidekicks are Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro, Cradle Will
Rock) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson, The Thin Red Line), two
animated dimwits who specialize in hysterical slack-jawed expressions.
The three men begin the trek to McGill's home, but first they come upon
a strange black man speaking in riddles that foreshadow what the escaped
cons are going to encounter over the next four days.
And, oh, the things they encounter.  They rob a bank with the manically
sensitive `Babyface' Nelson (Michael Badalucco, The Practice), interrupt
a Ku Klux Klan rally, run into a slightly deranged bible salesman (John
Goodman, Normal, Ohio), cross paths with three lovely sirens, and even
cut a hit record at a radio station owned by a blind man (Stephen Root,
Bicentennial Man).  And the coppers are on their tail the entire
journey.
O Brother is full of all kinds of great 30s slang and mannerisms, plus
some wonderful Southern accents.  The music is first-rate, too, with
most being penned by T-Bone Burnett (he was part of Bob Dylan's `Rolling
Thunder Review') and Chris Thomas King, who appears in the film as a
blues musician at a familiar crossroads after a certain appointment (his
name is Johnson  Tommy, not Robert).  And Roger Deakins' (Thirteen
Days) lush photography is spellbinding, giving every scene in O Brother
a golden glow that could translate to a golden night at next year's
Oscar ceremony.
The negatives of O Brother are pretty minor.  At times, it seems like
the Coens (The Big Lebowski) just stuck a bunch of random ideas
together, using bits that they couldn't squeeze into their previous
films.  From the color of the leaves and the dead corn stalks that make
up the backgrounds of nearly every scene, it should be autumn, but a
newspaper tells us it's the middle of July.  The film also wags its
tongue at P.E.T.A., showing some pretty bad stuff happening to animals
for comedic value.
Surprisingly, O Brother is practically a musical, offering more than a
couple of nicely orchestrated song and dance numbers.  Also somewhat
shocking is the strong performance from Clooney, who seems totally wrong
for a role like this, but does an exceedingly good job.  Turturro and
the relatively unknown Nelson (he directs an upcoming version of
Othello'  called O) deliver great performances, too.  An interesting
note: Turturro supplied the voice of Badalucco's dog when he played
David Berkowitz in Summer of Sam.
1:46  PG-13 for adult language, violence and some bad animal cruelty

        Fans of the Coen Brothers--they made "Raising Arizona," "Barton
Fink," "Fargo," and "The Big Lebowski," among others--are going to eat up
their latest film, a Depression-era musical comedy/drama loosely based on
Homer's "The Odyssey."  Others may be less appreciative, or downright
flummoxed.  Like those films before it, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
showcases the Coen's absurdist humor, their amazing ear for dialogue and,
mostly, their unrivaled inventiveness.  This is not a film you can easily
categorize or compartmentalize.  It's unpredictable, it's unorthodox, it's
occasionally quite funny (but, oddly, not as funny as it should be or,
perhaps, thinks it is).  And that, my friend, is the overriding problem
with the film: it's all a bit too much.  You come away with the feeling
that the boys have gotten a little full of themselves.  Brilliant has
always been a tough act to follow, I suppose.  "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
(the title comes from the Preston Sturges film "Sullivan's Travels" and,
not surprisingly, the Coen's latest feels like a Sturges comedy for much of
the time) follows the trials and tribulations of three chain gang escapees
in rural Mississippi, circa 1937.  Our heroes are played by George Clooney,
John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is
the smooth-talking one; he's obsessed with his hair and getting to $1.2
million's worth of buried bank notes before the state troopers catch him,
or the dam bursts.  Clooney is really the pivotal character in the film,
since Turturro and Nelson just act dumb and vacant around him, heightening
Clooney's Dapper Dan appeal.  The film, like Homer's lengthy poem, is
episodic, with the boys' journey interrupted by various colorful
characters.  There's a black guitar player they meet at a crossroads who's
just sold his soul to the devil (he wasn't using it) and with whom, as The
Soggy Bottom Boys, the foursome cut a hit record.  There's a one-eyed bible
salesman (played by Coen regular John Goodman); a gangster, Babyface
Nelson, who prefers to go by George; and a wife (Holly Hunter) with seven
kids in tow.  In addition, there are three seductive sirens washing clothes
in the river; a Governor (Charles Durning) whose campaign is being done-in
by a midget; and the Ku Klux Klan.  On top of all this, cinematographer
Roger Deakins makes this the yellowest film you have ever seen!  Nobody has
ever accused the Coens of going mainstream, and they're certainly not going
to start now.  However, like that traveling bluegrass guitarist Ulysses,
Pete, and Delmar encounter along the way, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
seems to be missing just one thing: a soul.

Maverick movie directors eventually become domesticated. Don't believe
me? The same guy who directed The Conversation also directed Jack.  The
man behind The French Connection helmed Blue Chips.
        Whether it's through common sense, clean living, or skill, Joel and
Ethan Coen have avoided a creative snag.  After some 20 years, their
movies are still original, intelligent. and funny without being aloof. 
Their latest effort, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, is no exception.  Based
on Homer's epic, The Odyssey, and set in Depression-era Mississippi, the
brothers have done the unthinkable: They've taken classic literature and
made it fun.
        The tale, which includes references to the poem throughout, has three
escaped convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Evans)
overcoming various obstacles in retrieving a load of loot Clooney has
supposedly hidden.  Of course, things go awry in classic, semi-bizarre
Coen brothers style.  There's a meeting with a one-eyed Bible salesman
(John Goodman), a chance encounter with an overly sensitive Babyface
Nelson, and a flirtation with fame when the cons become hillbilly
singers.  Oh, and I forgot to mention encounters with the Ku Klux Klan,
the excitable governor of Mississippi (a hysterical Charles Durning),
three very sexy sirens, and a load of spirituality.
        A lot is thrown at the audience here, but Joel and Ethan (no, I don't
know them) continue to be experts at molding the workings of a fevered
imagination with dramatic substance.  Look at Fargo.  Yes, it is about a
kidnapping gone brutally awry and the excessively pregnant cop who
solves the case, but the film is really a portrait of a small-town
nobody (William H. Macy's car salesman) and how unbelievably desperate
he is to be someone -- so much so that he initiates his own wife's
abduction.
        The same magnificent trick happens in Brother.  The sirens, the fame,
the power of Babyface are all brilliantly presented as part of a
supremely entertaining road movie.  But these events and people are
material obstacles the characters must overcome to achieve real
happiness and awareness, which occurs in a climax I wouldn't dare spoil.
        The performances from the three leads are a huge asset, as they avoid
becoming three Forrest Gump clones.  Nelson is especially good.  I've
never heard of him, but I'd like to see more of him.  As a yokel who's
determined to get the family farm back, he has a goofy lack of
pretension that seems genuine.  He's the anti-Pauly Shore.
        As for Turturro, is there any role the man can't play?  I've been
watching him for years, and he's never given a bad performance.  He's
played child-molesting bowlers, card sharks, meek general store clerks,
and rednecks all the same way-superbly.  Clooney is also edging up on my
list of suave and talented actors.  His laid-back, articulate cool
provides the perfect tone for the movie.  It's a joy to watch him here.
        And it's a joy to watch this movie as a whole.  The Coen brothers are
all about pushing the envelope, and then reading the surprisingly
intelligent, thoughtful letter inside.  In Brother the skill and clarity
in which they do this is astounding.

   Thick and rich with Depression-era ambiance while making
no attempt to fashion critical political or social commentary on
its impact, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is targeted
principally to die-hard fans of the surreal and creative touches
of the Coen Brothers. If you liked "Fargo," which was blessed
by the magical casting of Frances McDormand who provided
a center for the layering of observations about Minnesotans,
you stand a good chance of smiling through "O Brother." 
Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers' latest offering has little of
the disarming comedy of "Fargo," the wacky style of "Raising
Arizona," and precious few of "The Hudsucker Proxy"'s
surreal moments.  While the picture is creatively
photographed by Roger Deakins in the traditionally sepia
tones usually reserved for pics about America during the
thirties, and while the musical score, particularly the
bluegrass mood, is disarming, the whole comes out less than
the sum of its parts.
   The intriguing title comes not from Homer's "Odyssey" on
which the story is loosely based but on Presten Sturges' most
important hit, "Sullivan's Travels," which featured Joel
McCrea in the role of a movie director who decides to do a
serious film and sets out with a dime in his pocket to
experience the real world.  Similarly "O Brother" focuses on a
trio of convicts on a Mississippi chain gain who cut away from
the daily round of breaking rocks to experience life in other
parts of the Deep South with no idea how they are going to
finance their commute or to evade the pursuing law.
   The breakout is motivated by the would-be leader of the
trio, Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), who tells his
pals Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) that
if they escape with him, he can lead them to a $1.2 million
buried treasure.  In reality, Everett's goal is to get back with
his ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who, it turns out, is about to
marry another.  As Everett announces his plans and his
dreams with a rich vocabulary obviously foreign to others in
the chain gang or in the staff of officers guarding the men, we
get the impression that he may be about the smartest guy in
the state--which is led by a thick-waisted, thick-headed
governor, Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning).  As the men
pursue the fictitious treasure, they embark on a Homeric
Odyssey which begins as a blind man pushing a railway
handcar gives them a lift while counseling them like a thirties
Cassandra that they will indeed find a treasure but one
different from that which they are seeking.
   Along the road they meet up with Tommy Johnson (Chris
Thomas King), a black guitarist who has allegedly sold his
soul to the Devil, in return gaining the ability to strum his
guitar like Orpheus.  They form a bluegrass company, The
Soggy Bottom Boys, which soars to number one on the
charts, leading the people throughout Mississippi and
Alabama to wonder who these gifted, mysterious musicians
are.
   Magical experiences abound as the three cons, one step
ahead of the law, are in turn seduced by a trio of
contempoary sirens, beaten by a kind of Cyclops (John
Goodman) who swindles them into thinking he is going to set
them up in the business of selling Bibles, and even
accompany an over-the-top Baby Face Nelson (Michael
Badalucco) on a bank robbery and a chase in which the
celebrated bandit roars, "Come and get me, coppers."
   The Coen Brothers display their most startling imagery at a
huge gathering of Ku Klux Klansmen, all in white robes
except for their colorfully attired leader.  As they prepare to
lynch Tommy Johnson, they engage in a dance number that
could have come out of The Wizard of Oz or even Dancer in
the Dark.
   "O Brother, Where Art Thou" can be appreciated for its
moments like these of bold imagery, while its soundtrack of
bluegrass gems can make us wonder how decades of hard
rock music ever supplanted this all-American breed of
melody.  Looking at the whole picture, though, I couldn't help
thinking that this is a road movie of one-damn-thing-following-
another, a story whose loose ends are tied up only in the final
moments.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney, "Three Kings") takes his ball and
chain mates Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, "The Thin Red Line") and Pete
(John Turturro, "Rounders") on an escape from a 1930s Mississippi hard 
labor camp.  The three embark upon an adventurous road trip in a race against
time as Everett's gold is buried in an area slated to be flooded by the
Tennessee Valley Authority in Joel and Ethan Coen's "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?"
The Coen brothers excel at recreating American film genres and styles.
The ambitious "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" bears more than a passing
resemblance to its namesake, Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels"
(it was the name of the serious film comedy director John L. Sullivan 
(Joel McRea) wanted to make in that film before he discovered the value
of comedy).
The threesome are immediately in hot water when Pete's cousin, whom they
went to for shelter, turns them in.  ('Damn, we're in a tight spot!'
pronounces Everett.)  Menancing Sheriff Cooley (Daniel
Von Bargen, "The General's Daughter") and his pack of bloodhounds is
never far behind them from this point on.  After stealing a car, they
pick up a black blues guitarist, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King),
hitchhiking at crossroads in the middle of nowhere after selling his soul 
to the devil.  After a brief interlude where Delmar and Pete get baptized
they're cutting a record at a remote radio outpost as the Soggy Bottom
Boys.  Unbeknownst to them, their record climbs the charts as they
cross paths with Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco, "Summer of Sam"),
lose Pete to a trio of river Sirens (Delmar's convinced they've turned
him into a toad), get beaten and robbed by a maniacal bible salesman,
Big Dan Teague (Coens' vet John Goodman), and rescue Tommy from the Ku
Klux Klan in a scene straight out of the "Wizard of Oz!"  Then there's
the film's double climax as Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning)
challenges rival Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall, "The Deep End of the Ocean")
at a political rally while Everett attempts to woo back his wife Penny 
(Holly Hunter) followed by the final showdown with Sheriff Cooley.
The film is surreally funny, featuring oddball Coen humor such as Baby
Face Nelson shooting at cattle ('Oh George, not the livestock!' wails
Delmar) and Everett's constant search for his brand of hair pomade (Dapper
Dan's).  While it doesn't reach the heights of the Coens' very best
("Fargo," "Millers Crossing," "Blood Simple") because of its meandering
ways, it's a solid middle effort with charm to spare.
George Clooney channels the comedic charm of Clark Gable in a stylized,
yet pitch perfect performance.  Preening in a mirror or issuing the goofiest
of dance moves as a Soggy Bottom, Clooney fits into the Coen brothers' brand
of comedy like a custom tailored suit.  Tim Blake Nelson, known more for
his writing/directing skills behind the camera ("Eye of God"), is sweetly
stupid as the trusting, animal loving Delmar (butterflies are always drawn
to this character).  John Turturro is the high strung, manic member of the
threesome.  Of the supporting players, Stephen Root (TV's "Newsradio") gets
some mileage out of a brief appearance as a blind radio station manager
while Durning blusters and flusters as Pappy O'Daniel with his two yes
men and lookalike son Junior (Del Pentecost).  Other cast members mostly
go through the motions.
The film is beautifully shot in a golden glow by the Coens' frequent
cinematographer Roger Deakins ("Fargo").  T Bone Burnett provides the
authentically antique sounding music.

I sat watching the Coen Bros. latest film, "O'Brother, Where Art Thou?" in 
stunned silence. I certainly watched with admiration that the Coens would be 
interested in the Depression era. I liked the art direction and the 
cinematography by gifted cinematographer Roger Deakins, who also photographed 
"Fargo." The film has a sense of time and place, and it has all the hallmarks 
of a wonderfully crafted period piece. The problem is that there is no 
attitude, no edge, no life. In fact, this remains the most lifeless, 
laughless comedy I've seen in years, and the Coens are to blame entirely for 
this misfire. 
The film begins promisingly enough with the shot of a chain gang working on a 
railroad. Three prisoners escape and keep ducking across an open wheat field, 
unseen by the prison guards. They are Ulysses Everett McGill (thin mustached 
George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) - three 
fools with not one brain cell to their name. Nevertheless, Ulysses considers 
himself the leader of the group as they try unsuccessfully to hop on a 
freight train. Later, their chains are cut by a local who turns them in to 
the cops. The trio escape, finding themselves in one comical situation after 
another. Ulysses's intent is to find some secretly stashed money that they 
can split among themselves. Along this journey, they encounter trigger-happy 
Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco) who hates to be called Babyface, a 
one-eyed, vicious Bible salesman (John Goodman), members of the Klu Klux 
Klan, a remote radio station man (Stephen Root) where the trio cut a record 
as the Soggy Bottom Boys, and three sirens by a river who luxuriate their sex 
appeal in one of the most surreal setpieces the Coens have ever devised in 
their career. 
And yet I was mortified by how little any of this made me laugh, much less 
chuckle. I sat watching all these events unfold on screen yet none of it 
engaged me on any level. Every sequence is flat and joyless, including a KKK 
rally that is neither ominous nor remotely funny. There is one brief segment 
involving the possibility that Pete has turned into a horny toad but it never 
leads anywhere. The sequences hang loosely with no weight or substance. 
The actors do not help in the least. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson merely 
react with artifical expressions that seem less alive than those found in a 
Norman Rockwell painting. The Coens refuse to invest any humanity in these 
characters so that every single situation, every actor, every line is 
reinforced with a robotic mentality that produces no chemistry, no interest 
and no imagination. Holly Hunter shows up in a throwaway cameo as McGill's 
previous lover who finds him to less than "bona fide." She shows some 
strength and vitality and refuses to come off as an automaton or a cartoonish 
caricature, unlike the rest of the cast. 
"O'Brother, Where Art Thou?" reminded me of the frenetic road comedy by the 
Coens known as "Raising Arizona," which has become something of a cult clas
sic and which I less than admire. I suppose their over-the-top brand of humor 
of the anything-goes school of comedy doesn't click with me at all, as I was 
also one of the few supporters of "The Hudsucker Proxy." I admire their 
intentions in creating a zany comedic period piece (and thus basing it on 
Homer's "The Odyssey") but I found nothing here to connect with me on any 
level. Perhaps it is time for them to go back to their film noir roots, 
"Blood Simple" and "Fargo," two of my favorites by the Coens.  Here, the 
Coens seem to be dangerously close to traveling nowhere.

Susan Granger's review of "O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?" (Disney/Universal)
  Joel and Ethan Coen have built a reputation on their quirky,
intelligent, unorthodox films ("Fargo," "The Big Lebowski," "Raising
Arizona," "The Hudsucker Proxy," "Blood Simple," "Barton Fink") and
this is no exception. Who else would approach Homer's classic
"Odyssey" with a Preston Sturges touch? Yet there is is, up on the
screen, a road movie beginning with a blind prophet. Set in the 1930s,
the story begins as three shackled convicts escape from a Mississippi
chain gang: charming, articulate Everett Ulysses McGill (George
Clooney), a schemer who's obsessed with his Dapper Dan hair pomade and
getting back to ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter); dumb Delmar (Tim Blake
Nelson) and moody Pete (John Turturro). Relentlessly pursued by state
troopers on their way to find $1.2 million in buried loot, they
encounter the Cyclops, embodied in a one-eyed Bible-thumper (John
Goodman), and the Sirens, three seductive maidens washing laundry in
the river - along with a notorious bank robber, Babyface Nelson
(Michael Badalucco), a campaigning Governor (Charles Durning) and the
Ku Klux Klan. The title comes from the oft-mentioned film in Preston
Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels." To spice up the episodic structure and
stolid pacing, there's T-Bone Burnett's tuneful bluegrass music, as
the trio joins up with a black guitarist (Chris Thomas King), who sold
his soul to the Devil, to cut a hit record as "The Soggy Bottom Boys."
While Roger Deakins' photography is visually stylish, there's a
fundamental problem: a complete lack of humor. It's a comedy with no
laughs. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?" is a goofy, bizarre 5, appealing primarily to devoted Coen fans
who will accept their colorful, absurdist style over substance.
