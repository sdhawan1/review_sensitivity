Susan Granger's review of "CHICAGO CAB" (Castle Hill Productions and
Dream LLC)
All of us have plopped ourselves down in the back of a cab to
go somewhere but - have you ever thought of all the different
passengers thatdriver has encountered in one 24 hour period? That's
the premise of "Chicago Cab," adapted by Will Kern from his
long-running, award-winning play, "Hellcab," drawn from his own
experiences driving a cab in the Windy City. Paul Dillon recreates
his stage role as the lonely cab driver, delivering a sweetly
solitary performance as he attempts to evoke some warmth and
humanity in the midst of a cold, chaotic Christmas season. Mary Cybulski
and John Tintori, a husband-and-wife directing team, keep the pace
fast and furious as he picks up fare after fare on the day of the
winter solstice. Each encounter is a mini-episode, some more
poignant, some more repugnant than others. And there are familiar
faces: Gillian Anderson popsup as a hurt and angry Southside woman
of questionable morals, while John Cusack is simply a scary
man. Julianne Moore is distraught and devastated crime victim, whose
story is then passed on the Reggie Hayes, an architect with a
sympathetic ear. But there's also the religious zealots, the 
Pakistani who complains he's driving too slow, the pregnant woman who
barely makes it to the hospital in time, the deli-chain owner, the
stoned girl for whom he buys a do-nut, the guy who got a bad deal on
a used car, the seductive suburban mom, and the pretty receptionist
whose businessman boy-friend thinks she's a slut. The quirky humor
is angry, funny, bawdy and irreverent - all at the same time.  On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to10, "Chicago Cab" is a boldly
original, engaging 6. Hop in for a weird, wild, most unusual ride.
