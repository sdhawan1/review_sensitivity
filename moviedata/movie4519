"Papillon" may have been Steve McQueen's last great role.
With his intense and determined personality, he was perfectly
cast to play the lead.
"Papillon" tells the story of an 'innocent' Frenchman
convicted of murder during the 1930s and sentenced to serve
his time in the prisons and work camps of French Guyana,
in Central America.  Once there, Papillon (McQueen) is determined
to not only survive the hostile conditions, but escape.
He enlists the help of a wealthy counterfeiter and prisoner
(Dustin Hoffman).
Although McQueen befriends Hoffman to use his money, he
later shows surprisingly loyalty to his friend, risking his
life on several occasions for him.
Hoffman gives an even better performance than McQueen.
He is particularly good at the film's end, when his character
has become so eccentric that he talks to pigs as if they
were people.
"Papillon" is not for the faint of heart.  There is realistic
but graphic violence, and the deprivation and suffering that
McQueen endures in prison is shown at length.  Still, these
scenes are important because they demonstrate how cruel and
oppressive a "civilized" nation can be to its prisoners.
McQueen plays an underdog that attracts sympathy from
others, who aid him in his escape attempts.  However,
those characters that represent power (of Church
or State) show much less integrity and betray him.
The film has credible and non-stereotypical portrayals
of a leper, a homosexual prisoner, and an aboriginal chief.
