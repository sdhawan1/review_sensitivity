An American Rhapsody offers us an example of teen acting gone
marvelously right.  As a 15-year-old who wants to rediscover her
Hungarian roots, Scarlett Johansson portrays the thrill and frustration
of being a teenager so perfectly that I don't ever want her to grow
up.   And her voice, with its cracked rage, only makes her desire to get
control in her life sound more convincing.
When Johansson (Ghost World) is on screen, An American Rhapsody has a
riveting passion and dramatic urgency that is found nowhere else in the
movie, which is based on director/screenwriter's Éva Gárdos life. 
Johansson's character, Suzanne, is left behind in Hungary as an infant
when her family stealthily moves to America circa 1950.  Six years
later, the young Suzanne is finally brought to America, where she joins
her parents, Margit and Peter (Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn) and
her older sister (Mae Whitman).  However, Suzanne is torn away from the
parents (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi and Balázs Galkó) of a family friend who
nurtured and protected her from government suspicion.
Suzanne has trouble fitting in with a world of hula-hoops and
hamburgers, running away several times.  At 15, she is still fleeing,
only this time to smoke cigarettes, make out, and dabble in other forms
of teenage rebellion.  This doesn't sit well with Margit, who soon
results to locking Suzanne in her bedroom.  When Suzanne finds a shotgun
in her closet and starts blasting away at her locked bedroom door, she
decides that a trip to Hungary will set things straight.
Until Johansson appears, the proceedings dawdle.  Gárdos, a longtime
film editor, spends too much time setting up the movie's powerful final
stretch.  A fascinating array of characters gets left in limbo, and a
load of potential powerhouse dramatic moments get ignored.  Margit, who
has come from an obviously wealthy upbringing, finds herself working as
a waitress and writing letters to anyone who could bring Suzanne to
America.  Peter, who dreams of running a publishing house in America,
ends up building airplanes.  Gárdos doesn't show how the couple reacted
to such a sudden social shift without their little girl.  There had to
be nights of terse bedroom conversations, quiet sobbing and
reassurances.  
And what about Margit's mother (Ágnes Bánfalvy), who spends time in
prison for protecting her family, including Suzanne?  Late in the movie,
she tells Suzanne she endured the time behind bars by thinking of fairy
tales to tell her grandchildren.  With a more experienced director (this
is Gardos' feature film directing debut), the possibilities for showing
the grandmother's distraction could have been fascinating.
The movie works best when Johansson is onscreen.  Scenes involving the
six-year-old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz-Banlaki) are also wonderful. 
There's not an ounce of stage mother gusto in her performance.  And
Gardos does craft some nice moments in her film where the pursuit of the
American dream tears at your roots.  A scene when Endresz-Banlaki calls
Kinski "lady" as she's tucked in is hard to forget.
Most of the movie, unfortunately, lacks emotional power.  America is a
nation of immigrants -- we all know stories of how our families made
sacrifices to get here.  In a movie about immigrants' pluck and grit, a
director can't just focus on a settling story.  We've heard that
before.  He or she must take pains to hit on a human level.  Gardos
sporadically does that in An American Rhapsody, but fortunately there's
enough evidence here to support she will be more accurate in the future.

At a '50s California backyard barbeque to celebrate the family's reunion
with 6-year-old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz Banlaki), who was separated from her
parents at infancy and raised behind the Iron Curtain, her father proposes a
toast : `America  the greatest country in the world!'  It's a perspective we
appreciate today with special poignancy, as the Stars & Stripes fly from our
porches and flutter from our cars.  
Eva Gardos, the writer/director of this autobiographical film, traveled a
difficult road to her appreciation of this country.  In fact, it wasn't even
this country to which her family fled from communist Hungary in the early
Fifties.  They came to Canada, but Canada has a smaller movie market, so the
cinema version of her family wound up in southern California.
`An American Rhapsody' begins in Casablanca-esque  black-and-white, as
Peter (Tony Goldwyn) and Margit (Nastassja Kinski) escape from Budapest with
their 5-year-old daughter, leaving baby Suzanne to be smuggled out separately a
day or two later by a woman who specializes in baby-smuggling.  But all does not
go according to plan, and the baby winds up stuck in Hungary, to be raised by a
childless couple (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi and Balazs Galko) in the countryside.  The
family has made it safely to Vienna (which is steeped in color like the land of
Oz) and procured visas for America, but they have to go on without the baby.  
Her parents work tirelessly to secure her release, but it takes years.  By
the time Suzanne makes it to America, she's a little Hungarian girl, devoted to
her Hungarian `parents'.  It's not an easy adjustment to this strange family
that declares itself to be her own (especially with the Fifties songs that
drench the soundtrack  `Primrose Lane' and what sounds like the white-bread
Georgia Gibbs cover of LaVerne Baker's classic `Tweedlee Dee'.)  In a way
Suzanne is just an extreme version of many children who suspect they somehow
wound up in the wrong family.  She grows into a rebellious teenager (Scarlett
Johansson), and battles horribly with her mother, who tries to control her in
much the same way the Russians did the Hungarians, with bars and chains on her
room.  Finally in 1965 she convinces her parents to let her return to Budapest,
where she has a chance to see first hand the country that has survived as a
paradise in her nostalgic childhood dreams.
`An American Rhapsody' is a heartfelt and affecting story, without being in
the first rank of the cinematic craft.  In can err into the soapish and the
heavy-handed.  There is some confusion in the telling, especially when it deals
with the reasons for the family's flight from Hungary.  Peter is a publisher,
and we assume it's free-speech trouble with the authorities that makes it
essential for him to get out, particularly when Suzanne tells us in voice over
`Father said everybody he knew was either in jail, or going to jail, or worse' 
But near the end of the movie we discover that there's an entirely different,
and more melodramatic, reason for the escape.  The end of the movie itself is a
problem  after lingering more than necessary over some of the earlier periods,
it rushes to a conclusion that telescopes too much into too little time, giving
it a simplistic comic book feel.
But the movie's emotional resonance outweighs its shortcomings, and a large
slice of the credit goes to Ms. Johansson (`Ghost World'), who digs into the
essence of her character and delivers something utterly believable and
thoroughly moving.  Tony Goldwyn, getting a chance to shed his bad guy shackles,
is excellent as the understanding father, and the Hungarian contingent,
particularly little Kelly Endresz Banlaki, is marvelous.  
`An American Rhapsody' is a timely reminder of the preciousness and
privilege of many of the things we take for granted in this country, and of the
fundamental value of having a place where we belong.

   I guess most of us think we've had weird childhoods, parents
who did not understand us, but Eva Gardos's coming-of-age story
is an unusual one because not many of us were in her
predicament. One example of what people like her went through
was seen in the documentary "Into the Arms of Strangers," about
10,000 Jewish children in Nazi-dominated Europe who were
whisked to England where they were adopted, some never seeing
their biological parents again.  Not that Eva Gardos was a
member of some hated minority in her native Hungary, and in fact
she never even felt a need to leave her homeland.  In "American
Rhapsody," which is a dramatization of her early and adolescent
years, she is seen singing songs in praise of the fun she has in
Communist Hungary during the 1950's, nicely decked out in a
white uniform with other genuinely smiling girls.  But her parents
faced a different set of circumstances, which is why Ms. Gardos
gives us a labor of love with a movie depicting her bewilderment
as a kid and later, her rebellion as an unhappy adolescent.
   Eva, who in this story is named Suzanne and is seen at the age
of one, again at six, and yet again at age fifteen, could scarcely
have known what impelled her folks, Margit (Nastassja Kinski) and
Peter (Tony Goldwyn) to risk everything by leaving the country of
their birth.  Peter's publishing house was closed down by the
repressive Communist regime governing the East European
nation and, as we later learn, someone happens to his wife Margit
that is quite a bit more gruesome.  Writer-director Gabor takes us
through the risky escape, as Margit and Peter, dressed as
peasants, are put on a train heading toward the Austrian border
under the supervision of whatever they call a Coyote in the
Budapest area, crawl under barbed wire, find themselves in
Vienna and later go to Los Angeles.  The trouble is that they have
to leave their infant daughter Suzanne behind because of a stupid
error by the little girl's grandmother.  Suzanne grows without her
real folks but stays in Budapest with foster parents, the kindly
Jeno (Balazs Galko) and Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi), inhabiting the
middle of the story at age six where Suzanne is played by the
marvelous and adorable Kelly Endresz Banlaki.  Suzanne is
wrested from the foster folks whom she loves by her grandmother
and whisked to L.A. to join her biological parents where at first she
digs the hamburgers, the Elvis records, and the lovely, if sterile,
suburban landscape.  By the time she reaches the troubled age of
fifteen, however (as played by Scarlett Johansson--formerly of
"The Horse Whisperers" and "Ghost World"), she's homesick for
the old country and the kindly people she leaves behind.
   I rarely want to throw tomatoes at the screen but I did in this
case--and this is not a criticism of the film.   Margit, who felt so
oppressed during the Soviet occupation of Hungary and was
itching to get out of there, now becomes a bit a Red Fascist
herself, just like the occupations forces in 1950's Budapest. 
While praising the land of  liberty, she suddenly does not like the
freedoms that her daughter wants to enjoy with a handsome boy. 
Seeing the teen kissing the lad, she has bolts put on Suzanne's
bedroom door and locks installed on the windows--to the chagrin
of the poor teen who by then wants to escape to freedom--back to
Hungary!
   The question that keeps us, oh, in the middle of our seats by
this time is: will she bolt for good and stay with her kindly
Hungarian folks, where she can find equally handsome boys and
be serenaded by gypsies?  Or will she sell out and realize that
America is her real home after all?
   Gardos wears her heart on her sleeve. After all, this is her story
and she must be proud indeed to share it with movie buffs
everywhere.  The film played first at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival
in the Czech Republic, then headed west to Nantucket, and is
now scheduled to open August 10 in NY and LA and later in the
rest of the country.  Aside from being an absolute labor of love for
Gardos, "An American Rhapsody" falls short of its title--a fairly
ordinary picture told in a conventional style albeit with canny
lensing especially in Budapest by Elemer Ragalyi, backed up by a
Hungarian crew in the city of bridges and an L.A. team here in the
States.  Though arthouse fare, the plot is schematic.  Important
gaps make us want to know more about, say, how the Red Cross
managed to sponsor Suzanne's solo trip at the age of six from
Budapest to L.A. via London.  Tony Goldwyn plays the kind of dad
we all wish we had--understanding, gentle, often at a loss to calm
down his neurotic wife.  And Natassja Kinski blinks quite a bit. 
But oh, that Kelly Endresz Banlaki--that's the little actress whose
notable performance will survive in our memory after the
predictable plot is forgotten.

When the oppression of the Communist regime running 1950's Hungary proved
too much, Margit (Nastassja Kinski) and Peter (Tony Goldwyn) take their
eldest daughter and flee for the refuge of America. But, they are forced to
leave their baby, Suzanne, behind to be raised by a kind, childless couple
for six years until they can manage to bring the little girl here, too.
Longtime film editor Eva Gardos takes the helm and tells her own story
about coming to America in "An American Rhapsody."
Working from her own script, Gardos brings us back to a tumultuous time as
the specter of communism descends upon the people of Central Europe,
bringing to a halt the hopes of freedom that arose from the ashes of World
War II. Book publisher Peter see the writing on the wall of Stalin's
growing hegemony on his beloved Hungary and makes plans to spirit his
family out of the country. His scheme go awry when he and his wife, Margit,
are forced to leave baby Suzanne in the hands of the child's grandma, Helen
(Agnes Banfalvy). Helen is soon arrested for her complicity in the couple's
escape and Suzanne spends her formative years with Jeno (Balazs Galko) and
Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi) on an idyllic farm in the country.
Margit, in the meantime, has not forgotten her baby and lobbies untiringly
to get her daughter back. She succeeds and, in a flurry of media attention,
six-year old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz Banlaki) arrives on American soil. But,
the little girl has only known Teri and Jeno as her parents and, while
growing close to Peter, has never embraced Margit as her mother. The
estrangement deepens when Suzanne reaches teen hood and the young girl
rebels at the overprotective hand of her birth mother. Things come to a
head when mom puts bars on her daughter's windows and an outside lock on
her door. Suzanne calls in a promise made to her years before by Peter to
go back to Hungary to the "parents" she loves. Margit, reluctantly, lets
her daughter go. Once back "home" again, the young woman comes of age and
realizes the importance and love of her real family.
I must laud Eva Gardos for her dedication in bringing her story to the
screen. Her effort borders on amateur at times and the overall work comes
across as something made-for-television, but there are some good things
about it, too. The best little thing in "An American Rhapsody" is the
charming performance by Kelly Endresz Banlaki as six-year-old Suzanne. The
diminutive actress comes across as a real little girl who makes the best of
being a stranger in a strange land. When, one day, she dresses in her
Hungarian clothing and sets off to play, unknown to her parents, we see
America through her innocent eyes.
Unfortunately, the story jumps ahead to teenage Suzanne (Scarlett
Johansson), a selfish young woman who stays out all night, drinks and hangs
out with her older boyfriend, much to Margit's despair. Johansson comes
across more like a spoiled brat than a genuine young rebel. The tone of the
film takes a down turn during this transition and the impact of Suzanne's
revelations about life when she returns to Hungary is diminished. She sees
her grandmother again and all of her teen angst and rejection of her mother
is changed when she hears "the real story." It all wraps up neatly, but
without much satisfaction.
The end of the Cold War opened up Eastern Europe to filmmakers and Gardos
makes the best out of the lovely old city of Budapest. We get a travelogue
presentation of the bridges and buildings that make up the city, but the
nice scenery does not help the change in pace from the film's first half or
draw you close to the older Suzanne. This part keeps the viewer at arm's
length from characters and loses the involvement gained when watching the
charismatic younger Suzanne.
The production has an artificial feel to it as the period touches - things
like hula-hoops - are used to show the timeframes the film follows. I would
have to watch again, but it seems that the attention to such details is
less than accurate, bringing my mind to question the chronicle of events
depicted.
"An American Rhapsody" is a heartfelt film and an obvious labor of love by
Eva Gardos, but the story loses steam when it leaves little Suzanne's
story, becoming a conventional coming of age tale, albeit one with Budapest
as a backdrop. I give it a C.

The movie has some of the most impressive cinematography (Elemér Ragályi, JACOB
THE LIAR) of the year.  From a rich Technicolor look that mimics movies of the
period to intriguing black-and-white flashback sequences, it is hard to pick out
a visual favorite.  The set designers (Alex Tavoularis and Stephanie Ziemer) and
the costumers (Beatrix Aruna Pasztor and Vanessa Vogel) work hard to get the
look authentic without overwhelming us with kitsch.  The 60s, in particularly,
is a hard era to recreate without producing parody.  
There's a lot more in this rich narrative that I haven't mentioned from the
maternal grandmother's plight in prison to the mother-daughter conflict of a
rebellious teen and an overprotective mother, who is dead set on never losing
her daughter again.  Is there anything I would change?  Not much.  I'd lose the
boy on the bike with the big American flag, which was a little too clichéd even
if it did provide a nice two-second visual.  If you leave happily teary eyed,
don't be surprised.  But don't worry, you'll won't feel manipulated.  
AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY runs a nearly perfect length at 1:43.  It is rated PG-13
for "some violent content and thematic material," and would be acceptable for
any kid old enough to be interested in such serious stories.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 24, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.

When Margit (Nastassja Kinski, "The Claim") and Peter (Tony Goldwyn, "The
Sixth Day") flea from 1950s Hungary with their daughter Maria, their infant
is supposed to follow, but grandmother Helen's (Agi Banfalvy) fears make
her keep the baby behind.  Heartbroken, the family continues on to America, 
while baby Suzanne is raised in the Hungarian countryside.  Writer/director 
Eva Gardos tells her own story of a life between two families and countries 
in "An American Rhapsody."
Childless farming couple Jeno (Balazs Galko) and Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi)
give Suzanne (at 6, Kelly Endresz Banlaki) an idyllic peasant folk 
fairytale childhood.  The child is happy and adored and doesn't comprehend
the occasional gifts which arrive from the United States.  Peter and
Margit have worked hard and achieved a middle class home in California
where Maria has become a typical American child.  Margit toils at a 
letter writing campaign to have her daughter returned to her and finally
realizes her dream.  Suzanne is taken from the only parents she knows
(who believe she'll be returned) and sent to America, where her arrival
is a media event.
While Suzanne enjoys a good relationship with her father, she's at war
with her 'new' mother.  The teenage Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, "Ghost
World") sneaks out of her bedroom window to drive around with her boyfriend,
drink and stay out all night.  Mom installs bars on the windows and a lock
on the door.  Suzanne loads a rifle and shoots up the room.  With the
family in crisis, Peter fulfills an old promise to send Suzanne to
Budapest, against Margit's wishes.  The trip allows Suzanne to become
whole and learn the secret her mother wished to protect her from.
"An American Rhapsody" is a personal story about the meaning of home
and family.  Suzanne's resentment at being left behind and torn from
the people who raised her is met with overwhelming mother love from the
woman who's dreamt of nothing but their reunion.  Elder sister Maria,
ironically, is the alien of the family, somewhat taken for granted and
completely assimilated into the new culture.  She drinks coke and slings
the slang while her babushka wearing sister gets lost in a neighborhood 
of identical tract houses.  While these early scenes are fascinating,
due in large part to the sensational Banlaki, the later teenage years
become wearying in their repetitiveness, with too many scenes of Margit 
standing in Suzanne's bedroom doorway while her daughter sulks.  Gardos 
doesn't get the mother's point of view across well and lets important
characters like sister Maria and Suzanne's boyfriend Paul all but
disappear (in fact, the shooting scene begins with Paul at the window,
but he's promptly forgotten, a jarring problem in such a climatic moment).
Kinski's fine as the overprotective mom, but Johansson fails to make us 
empathize.  Goldwyn is surprisingly good as the even tempered, practical dad.
The camera just loves Banlaki, and the film's at its best when she's
on screen.
Hungarian cinematographer Elemer Ragalyi ("Jacob the Liar")
shoots the early escape in a bluish black and white, letting full color bloom
when the family arrives in the West.  The film has a retro look, as if
it was filmed in the time period the story takes place in, which is
also complemented by the production (Alex Tavoularis, "Apocalypse Now") and 
costume design (Beatrix Aruno Pasztor, "The Wonder Boys").
Reminiscent of the equally uneven "The Man Who Cried,"
"An American Rhapsody" takes a bumpy road on its way home.

Many films based on true stories probably seem like good ideas while
storyboarding but suffer because there just isn't that much happening on
screen.  That's not to say they're bad, but a real-life event doesn't
automatically make for an entertaining movie.  Take that trip I made to the
gas station on the way to work today.  It was uneventful, and while I'm
happy with the way things turned out, it isn't something that should be
rushed into production anytime soon.
That's part of the problem with An American Rhapsody - it's just a bunch of
stuff that happens.  The film kicks off during the early 1950s in
Soviet-controlled Hungary, where a young family is about to hightail it
through the Red Curtain to make a new life for themselves in America.  Peter
(Tony Goldwyn, Bounce) and his kin are well off (he owns a publishing house,
just like Goldwyn's character in Substance of Fire), which makes it easier
to bribe their way into Austria.  With him are wife Margit (Nastassja
Kinski, The Claim) and young daughter Marie (Kelly Banlaki).  Not making the
journey is their infant, Suzanne, who will stay behind and, somehow, meet
them in Vienna in a few days (it's never clearly explained).
Of course, things go wrong and the family is forced to leave for the U.S
before little Suzanne can meet them, because it's apparently really
important to stick to an itinerary when you're taking a trip.  While Peter
and crew eat barbeque and listen to Elvis in suburban Los Angeles, Suzanne
is stuck with a pair of surrogate parents (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi and Balázs
Galkó) back in Budapest, where, presumably, she eats kindling and listens to
Zamfir.  But she's happy, and that's all that matters.
With help from the Red Cross, Peter and Margit are finally able to have
young Suzanne flown to the United States, where she is finally reunited with
the parents she never knew.  She has trouble fitting in (think having an
older sister is hard?  Try one who literally can't understand you) and longs
to return to the people who raised her, considering them more parental than
her biological parents.  Rhapsody flashes forward several years, where
Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, Ghost World) is now a rebellious teen who
constantly butts heads with her mother, who has now become a Red Curtain
unto herself, locking Suzanne into her bedroom and barring the windows shut.
To escape the oppression, Suzanne decides to go back to Hungary.
This is where things begin to go askew in the film.  For starters, it's hard
to believe a teenage girl would want to ditch mid '60s suburban Southern
California for Cold War Budapest, no matter how badly her life is going (she
could have hung around a few more years and joined the Manson Family, for
pete's sake).  Plus it offers little resolution to the preceding scenes of
full-on teen angst.  But, again, it's a true story, so you can't complain
too much about the lack of excitement.
Writer/director Éva Gárdos, who makes her debut behind the camera here, has
created a partially autobiographical film of her own youth.  She previously
worked as an editor, most recently on two films directed by Anjelica Huston
(Bastard Out of Carolina and Agnes Browne).  Gárdos certainly has an eye for
striking images, especially the shot of Suzanne wearing a red coat while
standing on a bridge in gray, lifeless Budapest. She also chose to shoot the
film's early scenes in black and white, switching to color stock when the
family finally crosses the border into Austria.
Rhapsody loses a bunch of points for having a third act that doesn't make
much sense, but gains some back for not being the calculating tearjerker you
might expect.  And it scores even more points for not wussing out on the
whole language thing.  I screened Rhapsody a few days after seeing Captain
Corelli's Mandolin, in which Nicolas Cage pretended he was an Italian
speaking Greek but was reciting his lines English the whole damn time.
That's not good enough for me, and it's not good enough for Rhapsody,
either.  Goldwyn and Kinski actually speak Magyar in the film's early scenes
(they're subtitled), which is a hundred times more enjoyable than hearing
them butcher some accent.
1:42 - PG-13 for some violent content and thematic material

presentation of the bridges and buildings that make up the city, but the 
nice scenery does not help the change in pace from the film's first half or 
draw you close to the older Suzanne. This part keeps the viewer at arm's 
length from characters and loses the involvement gained when watching the 
charismatic younger Suzanne. 
The production has an artificial feel to it as the period touches - things 
like hula-hoops - are used to show the timeframes the film follows. I would 
have to watch again, but it seems that the attention to such details is 
less than accurate, bringing my mind to question the chronicle of events 
depicted. 
"An American Rhapsody" is a heartfelt film and an obvious labor of love by 
Eva Gardos, but the story loses steam when it leaves little Suzanne's 
viewpoint, becoming a conventional coming of age tale, albeit one with 
Budapest as a backdrop. I give it a C.
