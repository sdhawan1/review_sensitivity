Roger:  Yes.  Theaters started showing trailers for MO' MONEY about
        two months ago with a prominent screen enumerating all of the
        artists on the soundtrack.  Ironically, the soundtrack provided
        the second funniest line in the movie.
Roger:        The scintillating Jam and Lewis soundtrack aside, this comedy-
        action-romance-with-a-twist-of-social-conscience portrays the
        story of a young man, Johnny Stewart (Damon Wayans) and his
        brother, Seymour (Marlon Wayans), two inner-city hustlers.
        When Johnny meets an attractive credit card company executive,
        he decide to find a real job to attract her.  The story becomes
        interesting when Johnny becomes unwillingly involved in an
        elaborate scheme of crime credit card fraud.
Roger:  Yes, it does have some sad commentary on the results of
        Reagan's voodoo economics.  For instance, while holding a
        full-time job, Johnny can't make ends meet until he supplements
        his income through illegal means.
