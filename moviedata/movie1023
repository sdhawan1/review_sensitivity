     It is a tough call which annoying trend represented by MAD DOG TIME
is more annoying.  Is it the Cameo-Rama, the insistence upon turning every
scene into a celebrity "Where's Waldo?"  Or is it the Pulp Affliction, the
impression that a film spilling over with kooky, garrulous gangsters must
also be spilling over with style points?  Writer-director Larry Bishop has
a terrible case of both in MAD DOG TIME, a simply awful piece of
pseudo-cool tripe which holds the ignominious distinction of being the
1996 heir apparent to THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD as "Film
Most Likely to Make You Wish No Aspiring Director had _Ever_ Seen a
Quentin Tarantino Film."
     Jeff Goldblum stars as Mickey Holiday, a hired gun with more enemies
than he can count.  As if it weren't bad enough that everyone who can pull
a trigger wants to challenge him to a quick-draw contest, Mickey now faces
the return of his former boss Vic (Richard Dreyfuss), a big shot who has
been spending some time in a mental hospital.  It seems Vic is likely to
be unhappy that Mickey hooked up with Vic's girl Grace (Diane Lane) while
he was away, even though Mickey is now involved with Grace's sister Rita
(Ellen Barkin).  Vic, however, faces problems of his own from rivals who
think the time is right to move in on his territory, rivals including Jake
(Kyle MacLachlan) and Ben London (Gabriel Byrne).  Vic's solution to all
his problems is Nick Falco (Larry Bishop), a cool gunman more than capable
of dispatching each and every one of Vic's enemies.
     Bishop, the son of comic Joey Bishop, clearly wanted to take a
contemporary crime caper and mix it with the swingin' sensibility of his
dad's old Rat Pack buddies.  The soundtrack is spilling over with 40s and
50s standards, including a couple by the Chairman of the Board himself,
and everyone walks around in tuxedos (for the gents) or slinky evening
dresses (for the dames) radiating smoothness.  However, in trying to
combine OCEAN'S ELEVEN with RESERVOIR DOGS, Bishop has cranked out a
script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even
notice that you don't care a thing about anyone or anything in MAD DOG
TIME.  Gabriel Byrne is the worst offender, trying to make his Irish
accent sound like Brooklyn Italian while blathering on about other
characters in lines which mistake simple, inane rhymes and alliteration
for cleverness.  There is an almost hypnotic monotony to the artificial
cadence of the speech in MAD DOG TIME; after a while, it begins to sound
like it was written by the R-rated evil twin of Dr. Seuss.
     With nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it, Bishop
resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who don't seem to belong on the
same planet, let alone in the same movie.  Billy Idol and Gregory Hines?
Joey Bishop and Burt Reynolds?  Paul Anka and Richard Pryor (whose
appearance seems not only unnecessary, but just plain cruel)?  Bishop even
goes for obscurity points by bringing in OCEAN'S ELEVEN cast member Henry
Silva as a narcoleptic hood, and flash-in-the-pan Christopher Jones of
WILD IN THE STREETS as one of Goldblum's challengers.  It doesn't matter
that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which,
whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup, makes many of them look
like prime candidates for the George Hamilton Memorial Melanoma Wing of
Cedars-Sinai.  Even the notoriously bronzed Goldblum looks like a British
schoolboy next to the burnt sienna complexion of Anka, Reynolds and Bishop
himself.
     At times, Bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince
the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in MAD DOG TIME,
giving Goldblum a couple of meta-conscious lines which refer to
characters, situations or dialogue.  There are even a couple of moderately
inspired moments, like having Dreyfuss and Reynolds, owners of two of the
most distinctive laughs in Hollywood, cackling away as they face each
other.  But when a film-maker spends this much time subjecting viewers to
a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious Rat Pack
stand-ins and have them mouth labored, grossly unfunny lines, he loses the
right to pretend it's all a lark.  The actors may have had fun playing
versions of Frankie, Sammy, Dean and the boys, but that fun isn't likely
to be shared by an audience.  MAD DOG TIME is a self-indulgent homage
masquerading as hipster cinema.  Worse yet, it's like THE CANNONBALL RUN
with cocktails and shark-skin.

Trigger Happy (1996) 93m.  Originally released as MAD DOG TIME
Love it or loathe it, writer-producer-director Larry Bishop's debut
outing is destined for cult heaven.  In summary, story sounds like a
run-of-the-mill mob flick:  Gangland boss Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is
returning to his nightclub after being released from incarceration. 
Other would-be mob bosses (Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Gregory
Hines, to name a few) wonder how to use this situation to their best
advantage.  They don't wonder too hard - everyone's solution to
problems in this scenario is simply to shoot everyone else dead, which
is exactly what transpires, in one measured showdown after another,
until the film's conclusion.  
The lack of compunction or consequence resulting from this gunplay
pushes TRIGGER HAPPY well beyond the fringe of reality, but that's
understandable:  Vic is being released not from a prison, but an
asylum - this story may be taking place entirely within his head. 
That's one plausible reason, at least, for the over-tanned
blemish-free makeup smothering all the characters (Dreyfuss himself is
positively pancaked with the stuff) - the inhabitants of Vic's world
are as neat and tidy as the precise, bloodless killings within it. 
Then there's the opening narration about the entrance of a new
universe, the references to the Big Bang theory and Vic's
conversations with God, and the extreme closeup of Vic's eye in the
final frames.  Vic, as demented creator of an equally demented world,
is ubiquitous throughout the story: other characters talk about him
constantly whenever he is absent from a scene.  In fact, Dreyfuss
doesn't put in an appearance until considerable buildup has elapsed. 
It's an interesting effect, because despite our warnings that Vic is
totally insane, Dreyfuss never actually does anything crazy (no
crazier than his contemporaries, anyway).  He needs do nothing more
than stare benignly and let our imaginations wonder how psychotic he
really is. There's almost one moment of revelation during Gabriel
Byrne's awful rendition of Vic's signature tune Â‘My Way' (What else,
for a Creator?), surely the most memorable cinematic representation of
that standard since Sid Vicious mangled it in SID AND NANCY.  It's an
interesting moment because we can't be sure if Byrne is snarling
remarks like `You're a paranoid schizophrenic' between the lyrics or
whether we are finally seeing/hearing evidence of Vic's delusional
psychosis.
The contribution of Byrne, who speaks in an unfathomable accent, is
the most comic of the film.  He makes a great foil for Vic's hired gun
Jeff Goldblum (my favorite performance among his credits so far),
whose wry, schoolboyish looks suggest he is concealing some sly prank.
 He, Dreyfuss, and Byrne form the crown of a cast list that is
irresistible, including the likes of Ellen Barkin, Diane Lane, Billy
Idol, Rob Reiner, and Paul Anka.  Rat Packers Sinatra, Martin, and
Davis dominate the soundtrack.  The original title, MAD DOG TIME was
meant to be an anagram of MAD GOD TIME, highlighting Bishop's
intention that his film be seen as an allegory.
