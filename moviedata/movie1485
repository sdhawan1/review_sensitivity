        Set and filmed in Africa, YAABA is an enchanting slice of life
which doesn't cater in any way to American audiences.  The movie, which won
the International Critics Award at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, takes us
into the world of Bila, a rambunctious boy living in a small village.  You
could think of Bila as an African Huck Finn.  He is the village
rascal--good natured but always getting into trouble, usually with his
stern father.  Bila gets in especially hot water when he befriends Sana, an
old woman whom the villagers have shunned as a witch.  Sana lives by
herself away from the village, but Bila brings her food and keeps her
company; he affectionately calls her Yaaba, or grandmother.  When he's not
visiting Sana, Bila either plays with his flirtatious friend Nopoko or
fights with the other boys in the village.
        The movie's charm lies not in its plot, which is virtually
nonexistent, but in its wonderful characters.  YAABA is set in an exotic
culture, but the personalities within the culture are universal.  There's
the town drunk, the kind mother, the bitchy wife, and various other human
archetypes.  YAABA is a unique opportunity to visit Africa without having
to spend your life savings on air-fare.
