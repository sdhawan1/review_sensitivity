Films that romanticize a sport where you dress like a mama's boy and
whack a ball with a stick are inherently stupid.  You can't even call it
a sport, since the only way a player can break into a sweat is if they
weigh over 300 pounds.  There's nothing spiritual or magical about the
game (you can get sand in your shoes at the beach, too), which is why
Happy Gilmore and Caddyshack are better golf films than Tin Cup and The
Legend of Bagger Vance.
Vance was directed by Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer), so right off
the bat you know it's going to be long, slow, beautifully photographed,
full of inspirational music and will most likely feature a lead
character who looks like Redford did 30 or 40 years ago (like Ralph
Fiennes in Quiz Show and Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It).  This
time up, it's Matt Damon (The Talented Mr. Ripley)
Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, a legendary Southern golfer who amazed fans
with long drives and a delicate short game in pre-World War I Savannah.
During the war, Captain Junuh lost all of his men in battle (in a choppy
Saving Private Ryan-ish scene) and came home to Georgia as a craggy
drunk unable to play the game because he'd `lost his swing.'
Meanwhile, Junuh's ex-girlfriend Adele (Charlize Theron, The Yards) has
inherited a struggling golf resort from her father, who offed himself as
the country's depression left his new business without any customers.
The only way Adele can keep the place from folding is to hold a gimmicky
exhibition golf tournament between the nation's top two golfers  Bobby
Jones (Joel Gretsch, who looks like Damon's doppelganger) and Walter
Hagen (Bruce McGill, The Insider).  But the only way Savannah's leaders
will sign off on the contest is if a local golfer is allowed to compete.
Enter Junuh, who is suggested to represent the city by young Hardy
Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief, in his film debut), a pre-pubescent chap
who has heard incredible stories about the once-great local legend.
Junuh, of course, doesn't want to have anything to do with the
tournament, but he comes around when a mystical black caddy named Bagger
Vance (Will Smith, Men in Black) literally appears out of nowhere and
helps the fraught golfer find his swing again.
Vance then proceeds to follow the typical sports flick formula  perform
badly at first, get better and better before swooning a little, and then
 well, I'm not going to give away the ending, but you can probably
figure it out on your own.  The last hole unwinds over an ass-numbing 15
minutes, meaning that this movie about golf is actually, at times, as
exciting as real golf.
As a long-time promoter of edgy, independent cinema, Redford seems like
he should be above this kind of schmaltz.  Vance tries too hard to find
its way into your heart (but, thankfully, not as hard as Pay It Forward)
with sweeping music (Rachel Portman, The Cider House Rules) and
sun-drenched cinematography (Michael Ballhaus, What Planet Are You
From?).  Judianna Makovsky's (Pleasantville) costumes  especially the
hats  are the standout from Vance's behind-the-camera talent.
Vance was based on a novel by Steven Pressfield and was adapted by
Jeremy Leven (Don Juan DeMarco).  The film is narrated by an older
version of Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon, Tuesdays With Morrie), which adds
another layer of the aforementioned schmaltz to the overall package.  As
far as the acting goes, Damon does well, but Smith is the standout.
Here, he's turned down to a `6' (as opposed to the usual `10' or `11'
he's usually cranked up to).  His understated performance, a technique
he used in his best film to date (Six Degrees of Separation), is
reminiscent of a younger version of Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss
Daisy.
2:07  PG-13 for adult language and mild sexual content

Runnulph Junuh (Matt Damon) had it all. He was a golf prodigy with a
promising future and a beautiful, wealthy young wife, Adele (Charlize
Theron), whom he loved madly. Then, the world was plunged into the Great
War and Runnulph went overseas to do his patriotic duty. The horrors of WWI
and the gruesome loss of his entire command drove Junuh to disappear from
all he knew and the life he loved in Savannah. He reappears unexpectedly
over a decade later to find that Adele is facing bankruptcy. She arranges
"the greatest golf exhibition on the best course" and Junuh is reluctantly
recruited as Savannah's favorite son in "The Legend of Bagger Vance."
Director Robert Redford, from the very start with his Oscar winning
"Ordinary People" through "A River Runs Through It" and "The Horse
Whisperer," has given his films a uniquely atmospheric feel that is his
signature. He continues to show his individual auteur with "The Legend of
Bagger Vance," this time taking on the fantasy story about a fairy
godfather who arrives on the scene at just the time when our hero needs
help the most. It's a trite, near overdone tale that benefits from the
strong performances of the leads, solid supporting cast and high-grade
techs. Redford isn't a shabby director, either.
While Bagger Vance (Will Smith) is an obvious Zen master, he, fortunately,
isn't forced to recite such homilies as "be one with the ball," but
screenwriter Jeremy Leven comes close. "It's you, that ball and that flag,"
says Bagger to the troubled Runnulph after the mysterious man appears out
of nowhere and offers to caddy for Junuh for "five dollars guaranteed." It
does get a bit cliched as Bagger gives his homey advice and observations,
like: "You lost your swing. We gotta find it," and "Let it [the shot]
choose you." Smith's wry demeanor and likable presence helps the filmmakers
get away with such obvious Yoda-isms.
While Smith revels in his down home rendition of Junuh's mentor and trainer
- he's a mix of the aforementioned Yoda, Mickey for "Rocky" and a little
bit of "E.T." - Matt Damon gives the most complex arc to his performance as
the insecure, troubled Runnulph. It's a subtle perf by Damon that
effectively uses facial expression to build his character, showing both
angst and determination.
When young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Montcrief) spots Junuh returning to
Savannah after many years, he immediately starts campaigning to get the
former golf genius as the local contender in Adele's $10,000 purse
tournament. Against his will, Junuh agrees to play and picks up his sticks
to learn the game again (and, maybe, rekindle something with Adele). Out of
the darkness comes Bagger Vance who immediately starts to rag on Junuh
good-naturedly, helps him find his game again and gets an agreement to be
caddy for the big match.
Once the fairy tale is established, the film gets down to the game.
Runnulph is playing two of the best in the business - Bobby Jones (Joel
Gretsch) and Walter Hagan (Bruce McGill) - and they are more than a match
for the insecure Junuh. He immediately falls behind and it looks like the
citizens of Savannah are about to have their hopes of a victorious local
dashed. Bagger doesn't perform any magic except to open Junuh's eyes with
the help of Hardy, who absolutely idolizes Runnulph. The golf play is
nicely done as the game becomes a metaphor for life. Junuh finds his
original swing.
The story shows its literary roots (the novel is by Steven Pressfield) with
plot threads that are separate from the main yarn. There is a nice little
subplot involving Hardy and his dad. Because of the catastrophe of the
Depression, Hardy's father, Frank Greaves (Trip Hamilton), is forced to
take a job as streetsweeper in Savannah. This is a point of humiliation for
the boy who is ashamed of the lowly job his father takes. Junuh helps Hardy
learn the truth about his father, a truth that turns the boy's eyes from
admonishing to admiring, making the small side story a nicely sentimental
one.
Backing up Damon and Smith are several good performances, especially an
endearing one by young Montcrief. The debut perf is an assured and varied
one as Hardy exhibits expressions of wonder, shame, happiness and sadness.
Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill flesh out their characters of Jones and
Hagan. Bobby Jones is elegance in motion and Gretsch captures this
gracefulness perfectly, while Walter Hagan represents raw power and
endurance, also captured well by McGill. Both men display the honor of fair
play and giving the game their best. The two actors get past the symbolism
of their characters and make them real people. Charlize Theron is only OK
as Adele, but hers is the toughest kind of role - the neglected/abandoned
wife.
Tech credits, as you would expect in a Robert Redford film, are of the
highest caliber. Michael Ballhaus, who collaborated with Redford on "Quiz
Show," gives the film an atmospheric look that captures the sultry warmth
of Savannah. The lush photography is coupled with an outstanding period
production design by Academy Award winner Stuart Craig and stunning
costume, especially for Theron, by Judianna Makovsky. Musical score, by
Rachel Portman, and songs of the time help to carry forth the period feel.
The fairy tale nature of "The Legend of Bagger Vance'" (though the "legend"
is never discussed) has been done many times before, but the good natured
outlook and mysticism of Bagger makes this an entertaining film that has no
golf prerequisite. I give it a B.

Jack Lemon walks out onto the fairway and has a heart attack. During 
this surprisingly un-traumatic experience he relives (that is, narrates 
to us) a story about a mysteriously wise (perhaps mythical) caddy that 
comes to the aid of a broken man back during the great depression. The 
story is told in the style of mid-80's films (like "The Natural"): warm, 
big, movie-like. Nothing is all that real, but really swell nonetheless. 
No artificial enemy torments our protagonists for tension (I found that 
refreshing). Well, there is a play at it early on, but most of the 
story's conflict rests squarely on Rannulph Junuh's struggle with 
himself. He's a first rate golfer, struck down in his prime (note the 
similarity to "The Natural") by war memories. The whole town of Savannah 
needs him to step up and play a big match against the two best golfers 
of the era. 
Damon (as Junuh) plays fine enough, but you might think that Robert 
Redford would be a "Natural" for the part, in which case you wouldn't be 
surprised to learn Redford directs. Actually, the actor I think of as a 
young Redford came to my mind - Brad Pitt. And though Will Smith does a 
better job than anticipated of playing the wise old (er... young) caddy 
Bagger Vance, Morgan Freemon would have been the more obvious choice. 
Yeah, Pitt and Freemon - I'm sure of it. Aside from that, the other 
casting choices were excellent. J. Michael Moncrief stroking a better 
than par swing as the 10-year-old Jack lemon. 
But hearty and hopeful too, and although it is structurally formulaic, 
the film goes several hundred yards in search of unformulaic details. 
Rolling off the green on a few strokes, the picture lays the ball right 
in the hole a couple of times as well. Improvements could have been made 
by striking Junuh with a few more (and detailed) flashbacks of wartime 
misery. Also, I'd have woven that last dance into a thing of beauty 
rather than a loose end in need of tying. That said, in a gentle and 
warm kind of way, I enjoyed the film. Not over the top great, but 
decidedly above average.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     Philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema. Steven Pressfield's
novel THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE seemed like a terribly unlikely candidate
for a film translation, because it wasn't really a novel. It was a primer
in Hindu spiritual thought (Bagger Vance, Baghavad ... get it?) combined
with a mash note to the game of golf, wrapped loosely around a period
narrative. There was no way Pressfield's book could be turned into an
engaging film. Then again, that's what people said about Norman Maclean's
A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, and somehow director Robert Redford managed to
turn that book into a pretty solid film. But how would a text comprised
primarily of mystical lessons and play-by-play from the links be rendered
on screen?
     Redford's adaptation of THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE radically
re-imagines Pressfield's novel to make it a more palatable screen story. 
In so doing, he rips out its soul and leaves a fairly bland sports drama
in its place. The bulk of the film takes place in Savannah, Georgia in
1931, where a once-in-a-lifetime event is about to take place. 
Cash-strapped heiress Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), desperate to
generate interest in her late father's golf resort while the Depression
rages, arranges for an exhibition match between the era's two golf giants: 
Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). There's also
interest in adding a local boy to the field, and everyone knows that World
War I hero and former amateur champion Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) should
be the one. But Junuh, psychologically scarred by the war, has no interest
in playing  until a mysterious fellow named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) 
shows up and offers to be Junuh's caddy.
     It's easy to see the logic behind most of screenwriter Jeremy Leven's
decisions in adapting BAGGER VANCE. He creates a romantic sub-plot by
casting Adele and Junuh as former lovers separated by circumstance; he
excises most of Baggers' lengthy speeches; he even tries to build up the
character of the young boy (J. Michael Moncrief) who will become the
story's flashback narrator (an uncredited Jack Lemmon) by exploring his
family's losses due to the Depression. The story is streamlined into a
tale of redemption and lost love regained, and the climax is rendered as a
nigh-mythical clash of titans. It's all quite clean and efficient, with
all the prosaic descriptions of transcendentally significant dogleg lefts
and most of the revelatory visions left on the page.
     In fact, it's so clean and efficient that it hardly registers as a
drama at all. While Pressfield's novel wasn't terribly concerned with
making his characters genuinely complex, it didn't really matter
contextually. Leven and Redford don't add much to that complexity, and
here it matters a lot. Redford is too concerned with making the atmosphere
mystical to give Junuh's pain an earthly urgency, and Matt Damon's
performance suffers as a result. Charlize Theron gets to weep a bit, but
Adele has "romantic interest" written all over her from the outset. Will
Smith does fine, relaxed work as Bagger, but his importance as a spiritual
teacher is diminished with his teachings reduced to fortune cookie-sized
aphorisms. BAGGER VANCE was not going to work on the screen with twenty
minute sermons on the Authentic Swing; it makes perfect sense to shift the
focus to the characters. It makes no sense to shift the focus, then still
leave the characters underdeveloped. 
     As usual, Redford directs a technically accomplished piece of work,
beautifully photographed by Michael Ballhaus and smoothly edited. There's
simply no weight to any of it, despite the intrusively heavy score by
Rachel Portman. Instead of a meditation on a personal journey to
enlightenment told through the unique nature of the game of golf, the film
becomes a period piece with a few appealing performances. What remains is
a film about whether or not Junuh will win the big golf match and/or win
the girl. And while it's competently rendered, it's not exactly the matter
of cosmic import the film builds it up to be. You can't blame a filmmaker
for radically altering a text as inherently uncinematic as THE LEGEND OF
BAGGER VANCE. Redford, however, alters it to the point that you wonder why
he bothered to make it at all. He understood that philosophy generally
makes for godawful cinema. He didn't understand that without the
philosophy, or rich characterizations to replace it, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER
VANCE just barely breaks par.

Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) has it all.  He's an amateur golf 
champion whose girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), is the
beautiful daughter of Savannah's wealthiest man.  However Junuh is so
traumatized by his experiences in WWI, he returns to Savannah a broken
man.  He makes no attempt to see Adele, preferring to play cards in a
shack on his estate and drink to forget.
Meanwhile, Adele has lost her father and is on the brink of losing his
last creation, the Krewe Island golf resort, because of the depression.  
She sells all she has to come up with a $10,000 golf exhibition prize and
charms the era's two (real life) greatest golfers, ladies man Walter Hagen 
(Bruce McGill, "The Insider") and Ivy League grand slammer Bobby Jones (Joel 
Gretsch, TV's "The Bold and the Beautiful") to compete, but Savannah 
demands one of their own play.  Young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief,
Jack Lemmon in present day), the story's narrator, proposes Junuh and
bicycles off to deliver him.
Junuh declines Hardy, but goes out to swing a few anyway.  Out of the darkness
arrives a stranger, Bagger Vance (Will Smith), who offers to caddy for
Junuh for $5 guaranteed.  Bagger has a way of talking Junuh back into his
game and soon Savannah is gripped in a home town media frenzy.
"The Legend of Bagger Vance" is a signature Robert Redford film, evoking
his starring turn in "The Natural" and the nostalgic glow of his own
"A River Runs Through It."  Golf is used as a metaphor for life as Bagger
advises Junuh and his young protege Hardy 'you can't win the game, you can
only play the game,' and 'find your place in the field - you need to find
your swing - get out of its way and let it find you.'
The cast is generally fine.  Smith holds back, speaking softly, letting
his words form a whisper cloud around Junuh's head.  His non philosophical
comments lend the film most of its humor.  It's a confident performance.
Damon is OK, if unexceptional as the conflicted Junuh, although he does
have a real shining moment when he explains to Hardy why he drinks.  Theron's
mostly decorative, with a Southern accent that wavers in and out.  
Character actor Bruce McGill is fun as the lusty Walter Hagen.  His golfing
style, where severe missteps are countered with brilliant catchup maneuvers,
is fun to watch, particularly when he's sizing up his next move, barefoot
in water wielding his ever present smoke.  Even better is Joel Gretsch as
the amazingly talented Bobby Jones.  It's Gretsch, not Damon, who's the real
Redford Golden boy standin.  He creates an elegant, upstanding athlete.
Young Moncrief has a wide-eyed face and displays real enthusiasm for the
game of golf and hero worship of Junuh.
Redford really involves us in the two day 36 hole game, visualizing the act
of focus and creating suspense in the outcome.  Unfortunately his present
day bookending of the tale with Jack Lemmon recalls the similarly poor
use of the device in "Saving Private Ryan."  The central romance is
underbaked as well, mostly because we're not given enough background on
why Adele remained single for a decade.  The script rather lamely has
them declare their attraction as 'dancing well together.' 
Production and costume design are first rate.  Several scenes set at the 
resort recall the period flashbacks of "The Shining."
If you can invest in the mysticism of Will Smith's supernatural Caddy (the 
only black man apparently admitted into Krewe Island's locker room) and the 
old-fashioned storyteling/filmmaking on display here, you may be surprised 
at the rewards to be found.  Cynical filmgoers should avoid this one.

At first glance, "The Legend of Bagger Vance" appears to be simply an
inspirational sports story, directed by Robert Redford with his
customary elegance and economy. But there is something more going on
here. Based on Steven Pressfield's book, "Bagger Vance" takes two
renowned real-life Depression Era golfers and introduces them to a pair
of characters from an ancient Hindu holy book. The result is a
beautifully photographed, otherworldly fable that presents a Buddhist
look at spirituality, set against an exhibition golf match.
It takes place in the late 1920s in Savannah, Georgia. Adele Invergordon
(Charlize Theron) decides to save the golf resort she inherited from her
recently deceased father by staging a celebrity exhibition match
featuring the two undisputed stars of the game, Bobby Jones (Joel
Gretsch, in a star-making performance as a charismatic Atlanta
gentleman) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill, delightful as a flamboyant
Yankee). To appease town leaders that want a Savannah native in the
game, she reluctantly agrees to add a third player, one Rannulph Junuh
(Matt Damon).
Years ago, Junuh was her love, as well as the most promising young
golfer in the South. But upon his return from fighting in the war, he
became a recluse, shutting out Adele along with the rest of humanity,
save for a few drinking and gambling friends. Local boy Hardy Greaves
(J. Michael Moncrief) tries to convince Junuh to join the match, but the
shattered ex-soldier resists, until a mysterious man named Bagger Vance
(Will Smith) appears late in the night and offers his services as a
caddy, and as a guide to help Junuh "find his swing."
Jeremy Leven's script strips the already-streamlined book down to its
essence; Junuh's spiritual journey with Bagger Vance. Leven may have
stripped away a bit too much  the book introduces the two long after
their teacher/student dynamic has been established, where the film
depicts their relationship from the first meeting, with Vance initially
coming off as a folksy enigma at best and a flake at worst.
Director Robert Redford draws warm, understated performances from the
talented cast and creates a picture marked by good humor, rich tones and
a welcome sense of restraint and balance. Occasionally, the score gets a
bit heavy handed and the production skirts the edge of pretentiousness,
but Redford keeps matters in check most of the time.
Now here's the fascinating part. Although the author of the book does
not point this out, "Bagger Vance" is a retelling of a portion of the
Indian epic, "The Mahabharata," where Bhagavan, an honorific title for
the Lord or for a spiritual master (a title which sounds a lot like
Bagger Vance) helps Arjuna (which sounds exactly like R. Junuh) through
his spiritual crisis. Bhagavan aides Arjuna in recognizing who he really
is, how he fits into the texture of existence and how to find peace in
the midst of action.
Thanks to fine actors and Robert Redford's great directorial skills,
"The Legend of Bagger Vance" can be enjoyed without that information,
but placed in its proper context, the little truisms of the story become
pieces in a vast, exotic puzzle that offers contentment when fully
assembled.

_The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Just who is Bagger Vance, and why is he so legendary?  Or, more
importantly, why should anyone care?  _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_,
Robert Redford's film of Steven Pressfield's novel of the same name,
offers plenty of pretty sunsets and New Agey gobbledygook but very little
reason why one should have an emotional investment in this benign, banal,
and sometimes boring inspirational drama.
        The main character is not Will Smith's titular golf caddy, but
one Rannoulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who at one point was considered the
greatest golfer in all the South, but tragedy on the battlefield in WWI
robbed him of all his nerve, not to mention the golf swing that earned
him the respect and admiration of many fans.  When Junuh's estranged
girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) stages a big exhibition
tournament to save the lavish golf course built by her late father, young
Junuh fan named Hardy Greaves (newcomer J. Michael Moncrief) sees this as
a chance for Junuh to reclaim his status after ten years of bitter
seclusion.  After some heavy duty campaigning by Hardy and Adele, Junuh
reluctantly agrees though his swing seems long a thing of the past. 
Enter Bagger Vance, who seemingly appears out of thin air one night in
Junuh's yard; a couple of golf pointers later, Bagger is Junuh's caddy.
        From this point, Redford and screenwriter Jeremy Leven could have
completely settled into sports movie formula, and their unwillingness to
fall into convention would be more admirable if their alternative were
more inspired.  Granted, one key variation from the formula--that Junuh's
two highly celebrated opponents (Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill) are good
people and not forced to fit into a "villain" mold--is refreshing.  But
the movie that Redford and Leven made really isn't about the tournament
so much as Junuh remembering his golf swing and all the psychological
healing that entails.  The problem is Junuh's trauma--his guilt over
being the sole survivor of his army platoon--is too simply handled, and
his road to recovery is less than convincing.  Bagger's long-winded
spiritual platitudes about golf are what set Junuh back on the right
path, and while the lyrical fairy tale gloss Redford gives the picture
keeps this point from being laughable, it simply reduces it to lesser
offense of being cornball.
        So where did Bagger get his bottomless pools of wisdom?  Who
knows; he could be a guardian angel, a mystical spirit, or just an
exceptionally perceptive and insightful man.  But the vagueness of his
character isn't as irksome as that of his more down-to-earth
counterparts.  Junuh: good guy, lost his confidence, needs it back. 
Adele: good gal, wants to preserve her dearly departed daddy's integrity.
 Hardy: good boy, wants his hero to succeed.  All the performances are
similarly nondescript, which is especially unfortunate in the case of
Smith.  Reduced to smiley-faced pontificating, the unpredictable energy
that usually makes him a captivating screen presence is as lost as
Junuh's swing.
        There is no denying that _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ is a
handsomely mounted production.  The film is exceedingly well done on the
technical end, highlighted by the cinematography of Michael Ballhaus, who
lushly captures the natural splendors of Savannah; and Rachel Portman's
subtle and evocative score.  If only the entire film were able to have as
firm a hold on the emotions as it does the senses.

Robert Redford's THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE, a "Zen And The Art Of 
Golfing" story, stars Will Smith as Bagger Vance, a mysterious and 
philosophical caddy, and Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh, a washed-up, 
local golfing legend.  With Bagger's cheerful help, Junuh discovers "the 
authentic swing in each of us."  
Set in Savannah in 1928, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is a disappointing 
but gorgeous film that features lavish period sets and appears to have 
been shot only in the glow of the rising or setting sun.  Its sweeping 
music tries to suggest epic proportions for a story that's badly lacking 
gravitas.  Incidents unfold unhurriedly.  The story moves along without 
much drive.  And Redford interrupts an already slow game to admire the 
local flora.  Just what golf needs, someone to slow it down.
The fictional story concerns a match between two real-life golfing 
greats, the effortlessly gifted Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and the 
flamboyant, ladies man Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill).  Along for the ride 
is a local golfing hero, Junuh, whose life was shattered by the war.  
After meeting Bagger, he reluctantly agrees to return to his game after 
10 years absence and become the third member of the match.  Putting up 
the $10,000 prize money is Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), Junuh's 
ex-girlfriend and owner of a nearly bankrupt golf course.
The problem with the production starts with the casting.  The 
over-narrated film features Jack Lemmon's flat and uninspiring 
voice-overs.  Theron, who has been quite good in films such as THE 
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, is way over her head and completely unconvincing as a 
manipulative Southern belle.  The minor actors playing Savannah's 
citizens ham it up with inflated Southern accents and exaggerated 
gestures.   J. Michael Moncrief, as Hardy Greaves, the story's 
ever-present kid, quickly goes from cute to annoyingly saccharine.  Matt 
Damon proves to be an acceptable but not an exciting choice as Junuh, 
giving us little reason to root for him.  The only actor who brings much 
to his part is Will Smith, whose performance provides the only credible 
argument to see the movie.
At its best, the movie can be funny and sweet.  "This is becoming 
embarrassing," Junuh confesses to Bagger after flubbing shot after shot 
on the first game of the big match.  "Oh naw, sir, it has been 
embarrassing for sometime now," Bagger says with a grin the size of a 
driver.
"The meaning of it all is: There is no meaning," Hagen tells Junuh about 
golf, life or both.  That about sums up the movie.  It's gorgeous and 
then it's over.  Even if Redford queues the heavenly choirs to sing when 
a ball approaches the green, he isn't able to escape the fact that what 
he has made is just a genre picture and nothing more.  He wants to imbue 
much meaning and spirituality to its message but never succeeds, no 
matter how earnestly he tries.
THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE runs a long 2:09.  It is rated PG-13 for some 
sexual content and would be fine for kids around 8 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, called the film, "nice."  He gave it ** 1/2 and 
said that he it too slow but had a good plot.  He mentioned that he 
liked the way that the narrator wasn't the main character.

Robert Redford's singular devotion to American mythology continues in
The Legend of Bagger Vance, the story of a golfer who's lost his swing
and the caddy who brings it back to him.  "Inside each and every one of
us," says Vance (Smith), "is our one true, authentic swing."  It's a
metaphor intended to apply to all walks of life, on the fairway or
otherwise.  If oversweet metaphors like this are your bag, then you're
really going to like Bagger Vance.
The story opens in the present with an aged Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon)
suffering a heart attack on a golf course.  As he lies quietly smiling
to himself, he muses on the frequency of his cardiovascular failures and
his love of the game of golf, which meanders into a quixotic narration
on the career of Rannulph Junuh (Damon).  Soon the narrative fades to
the past and we see Junuh at the height of his career, in the company of
the enchanting Adele Invergordon (played by Charlize Theron of The
Devil's Advocate fame; who, by the way, happens to represent the purest
embodiment of good, wholesome sex that the film industry has to offer).
Junuh is the greatest golfer in Savannah, Georgia, Miss Invergordon is
his true love, and they are about as privileged as anyone in the South
until Junuh ships off to serve his country in World War I, whereupon his
entire platoon is slaughtered in the grand history of Saving Private
Ryan.  Returning home he finds himself a mere shell of his former self
and--tragedy of tragedies--he has lost his golf swing.  This is about
the dumbest point in the entire film, the point at which I nearly wrote
the whole thing off.  There is absolutely nothing convincing about
Junuh's wartime horrors.  Damon's portrayal of shock at the sight of his
slain comrades is not unlike his appearance of dismay at losing his MIT
girlfriend in Good Will Hunting.  Fortunately, like any good
professional, I persevered.
Skipping ahead a few years, to the Great Depression, Miss Invergordon
has inherited her father's golf course and, determined to fend off
bankruptcy, throws a high profile golf tournament.  How exactly this is
going to work is not quite explained and, presumably, no one in town can
afford to pay admission, and she's giving away ten grand to the winner,
but anyway....  The two greatest golfers of the day are coming to play
and Savannah will be represented by none other than the washed up and
unshaven Rannulph Junuh.
Enter Bagger Vance.  Will Smith is predictably likable and witty as the
colloquially wise vagabond shaman who saves the day--and the story--from
otherwise certain grief.  The Bagger Vance character is not a new
archetype for Hollywood, but Smith's delivery of Vance's black Southern
dialect manages to convey an element often missed in such film
portrayals.  Where other stereotyped victims of segregation appear
merely ignorant or uneducated, we find a wit and, more importantly, a
will in Bagger's voice.  It's a subversion of language intrinsic to
African American culture, born of wisdom and cunning in the face of
adversity.  Will Smith's ability to carry this to the surface lends
wondrously to our imagination of his character, and forges a heightened
standard for future actors. Something in Smith's delivery is so
conducive to the suspension of disbelief as to render all things
permissible, and it took only a few scenes to reel this critic in.
In the end, Bagger Vance is a strong, memorable film, filled with rich
dialogue and vital camera work.  Though Redford seems to have fallen
back too heavily upon his overused and rambling A River Runs Through It
narrative style, the strength of the underlying story carries it off. 
Better directorial focus might have made for a hole-in-one, but as it
stands, this movie's a solid birdie.

Why do people always insist on trying to make me like golf? It's like those
folks at weddings who always try to get everyone else to dance, when they
obviously don't want to. Hey man, leave me alone, I don't want to dance and
I don't want to play golf! Feels like a strange "cult-like" thing or
something. When I was in business school, it was all about "you gotta play
golf to mix business with pleasure". When I joined the corporate world, it
was all about "you gotta play golf to suck up to the managers" and even now,
my married friends will come around and say "you gotta play golf man, it's
not as boring as it looks on TV".
Well, I've taken a couple of swings at the ball, never played a real game,
but still don't feel any need to wake up at 6am and club a little white ball
for hours on end. Just not my style. And even though THE FIELD OF DREAMS
actually made me feel like playing baseball, this film STILL was not able to
convince me of any so-called "magic" connected to the game. But maybe I'm
just not holding my driver the right way...
PLOT:
A guy who used to be a great golfer goes to war and loses his touch. He
returns in shame, abandons the girl he loved dearly and drinks himself silly
until a local golf tournament needs him to raise the spirits of the
townspeople. At that point, a figure by the name of Bagger Vance helps the
man regain some of his old self-confidence, take a shot at the tournament
and his old glory.
CRITIQUE:
This movie wasn't bad but I honestly expected a deeper meaning behind it
all, a bigger inspiration to go out and do something great in my own life,
or in the very least, a little magic. Unfortunately, none of that came
through in this movie, a film which looked great and felt good, but
ultimately didn't say much to me. The acting was solid across the board, but
nobody really stood out. The message of the movie was nice, but nothing to
change your perspective as such. The costumes were beautiful, the décor
authentic and even the golf courses majestic, all perfect accoutrements for
the events unfolding around them, but for me, most of the story seemed
pretty predictable from the start and nothing particularly fantastical or
surprising took me aback during the entire picture. Perhaps the film will
mean more to golf fans. I don't know. Perhaps there is a much greater,
deeper inspirational thought or message that I didn't pick up on. Not sure.
All's I know is that unlike the viewing of an actual game of golf, this film
did not bore me out my skull, and did manage to sustain my attention for its
entire two-hour run, so all in all, not bad. I didn't particularly care for
Will Smith's character, who I thought was a little too "nagging" and "glib"
to be of any inspiration to anyone, but he eventually managed to lighten up,
so no major harm done there. One thing that didn't grow on me was this one
particular continuity issue which just bothered me throughout. If Matt
Damon's character was supposed to have been this great golfer back in the
day, why is it that when he returns to the game all those years later, he is
still decades younger than the top golfers of that time? The fact that
Damon's character was this aged golfer who didn't look a day over 25 just
struck me as very odd and somewhat distracting. Or was that just me? Anyway,
other than that, the film was okay but nothing to go out of your way to see
on the big screen. Catch it on video and see Theron perfect the art of
crying in cinema, Smith finally show a little range as a dramatic character
and Damon, well, he's a good actor but a little too typecast for my taste. A
great looking picture with great looking people, a sad-sack romance, some
dopey lines and a so-so plot line. Interest you any?

   Nothing aids meditation about life better than having a
heart attack on the golf course.  You stare at the sky and as
your life begins to pass before you, you fixate on your
journey's most dramatic events.  In this case, Old Hardy
(Jack Lemmon), dropping to his knees and then his back
while suffering his fifth or sixth coronary assault, allows his
mind to drift to two seminal events in his life: one involves a
brief scene recalling a World War One battle engaged in by
his childhood hero, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) in which
Junuh's witnessing the death of his battlefield buddies causes
him to be shellshocked.  The other, which Old Hardy narrates
from time to time and which takes up the bulk of this story,
involves his role as onlooker to dramatic events in Junuh's
life--his romance with the drop-dead gorgeous Adele
Invergordon (Charlize Theron) and his Prozac-like revival
from the long depression emanating from his trauma on the
field of carnage.
   When a guy says that golf is a game that no one wins but
one which you can only play (as Old Hardy one once learned
from a most unusual fellow), you wonder what he means by
that: after all, there are winners in the sport, aren't there? 
You soon realize that Hardy is manipulating the game of golf
as a metaphor for life, and here the geezer is on safer
ground.  Indeed, life is a game, and no one gets out alive.
Ultimately we all lose.  But how you play the game is what
counts.  To demonstrate this, "The Legend of Bagger Vance,"
directed with Robert Redford's restrained hand, turns what
could have been a fortune-cookie story into a lovely tale
which skirts the borders of the maudlin but remains as solidly
authentic as the counsel it preaches.  "The Legend of Bagger
Vance" has added, mythic resonance since (as the splendid
online critic Edward Johnson-Ott points out) the film is
nothing short of a retelling from the Indian epic "The
Mahabharata," in which Bhagavan (meaning "Lord" or
"spiritual master") aids Arjuna thorugh a spiritual crisis.  The
name "Bagger Vance" sounds an awful lot like "Bhagavan"
and "R. Junuh" is not unlike "Arjuna."
   "The Legend of Bagger Vance" is situated in one of the
most touristic cities, Savannah, Georgia, just as the
Depression was to put thousands of its citizens out of work
and would lead to the suicide of Adele's father--who had built
a magnificent golf course only to see the land go unused. 
Adele, refusing to sell, takes a chance on attracting national
publicity by announcing a competition between two of the
world's great golfers, the strikingly handsome Bobby Jones
(Joel Gretsch) and a fellow known to put on a good show as
well as belt out a great game, Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). 
To attract the ardent interest of the locals, she also
invites a man with whom she enjoyed a pre-war romance,
Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who has "lost his swing" and
spends his time holed up with his heavy-drinking, card-
playing pals.  
   While Junuh has to be roped into the joining the game
given his utter lack of confidence, who better able to do the
convincing than Hollywood's most strikingly attractive
performer?  As the bold entrepreneur impresario, Charlize
Theron's Adele could probably convince hell to freeze over,
though she is unable to get her depressed boy friend to do
much on the golf course--not until the mysterious Bagger
Vance emerges from the nocturnal mist insisting that with a
little help from a concerned caddy, Junuh can get his groove
back.
   Redford's movie, scripted by Jeremy Leven from Steven
Pressfield's nostalgic novel, follows the trajectory of Frank
Coraci's "The Waterboy"--in-the-dumps guy finds his
authentic self and emerges as hero--but oh, what a
difference. While "The Waterboy" is a pathetic, dumbed down
attempt at comedy, "Bagger Vance" turns what could have
been fortune-cookie maudlin into a tender, well-acted, and
most of all controlled and adult yarn whose mythic roots
could scarcely be lost on any viewer.  The expressive J.
Michael Moncrief in the role of young Hardy Greaves is not a
cutesy-putesy sitcom kid in the game to attract the ahhhs and
ohhs and look-how-darling crowd but is as genuine an idol-
worshipping kid can be, a sight to be seen by today's youth
who are allegedly bereft of real heroes.  As Adele, Theron
shows us that saving her golf course is important but even
more consequential is revving up and saving her relationship
with her true love.  Will Smith is the perfect spirit, giving
advice like an ordinary human being, a caddy in fact, and not
with the lighting bolts and special effects visions so often
used to designate supernatural elements.  Even the crowds,
as well-behaved as they are enthusiatic, give testament to
Robert Redford's vision, the belief that you need no blaring
soundtracks or melodramatic brushes to represent the broad
spectrum of human emotion.  This is the way to tell a story.

At times we all would like a mysterious stranger to emerge from the mists
and impart sage wisdom that sets our life back on the path. And wouldn't it
be great if that guy had the coolness of Will Smith?
Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon shot through the "Look Like Robert Redford"
camera filter) has just such a stroke of luck. The promising suthuun golf
pro turned shell-shocked ex-GI is enticed to play in a big-time tournament,
but soon discovers that his game don't mean a thing if it ain't got that
swing. Then raggedy man Bagger Vance (Smith) steps out of the night to put
his driver one with the universe.
The film has the feel of director Redford's recent efforts: "The Horse
Whisperer" and "A River Runs Through It". Mysticism mixed with a rough
manliness and topped with feel-good ending.
Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's work is so beautiful that it's tempting
to ignore the movie's faults as he turns the game of golf into visual feast.
Tempting, but not impossible. Sports as a metaphor for life has to tread a
fine line between inspiration and corn. There's no tightrope walking here.
Redford topples into cartoonsville.
The Savannah town council is so goofy it could have been pulled from "The
Music Man". Junuh is "rescued" from a life of good-time drinking and poker
playing with his buddies. Not too bad a briar patch and it's difficult to
have much sympathy.
We never come to know much about any of these genteel folk. Vance himself is
the only character that works and that's because he isn't supposed to be a
normal human being. A black Zen Master in the Depression-era deep South:
this is not an ordinary traveler.
(You can hear the casting discussion between Redford and Smith: "I'm
supposed to do _what_?" "Well, you gots to shuffle like Steppin Fetchit, but
the upside is that you can almost walk on water.")
It's a pretty pretty film and worth a viewing just for that and Smith's
performance, but come on Bob, give us a story with people next time, huh?

For fans of golf  or any sport, for that matter  THE LEGEND OF BAGGER 
VANCE will capture the interest if not the imagination.  The philosophy 
spouted by the caddy Bagger Vance (Will Smith) frequently goes too far, but 
sport has always been a metaphor for life and the pursuits inherent in life. 
  And certainly the golf exhibition match at the center of the narrative is 
one of the best things about the film.
Based on Steven Pressfield's novel, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE chronicles 
the attempt of an erstwhile rich Southern belle, Adele Invergordon (Charlize 
Theron), to save her dead father's golf resort from the ravages of the Great 
Depression.  A cadre of rich Savannah businessmen wish to purchase the 
resort for a song, but Adele thinks on her feet of an exhibition she hopes 
will attract the star golfers of the time  Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen, 
and Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones.  Hoping in a small way to thwart her, the 
men call for the involvement of a third golfer, someone local.  After a few 
names are passed over, a young golf fanatic named Hardy Greaves (J. Michael 
Montcrief) suggests `Captain Junuh.'  This man Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) 
is the one we see near the film's start;  he's racing into the slaughter of 
a World War One battle, where it seems he is the sole survivor.  To be 
brief, Junuh loses himself.  Traumatized, he disappears for a decade, 
failing to return to Adele, who happens to be his intended.  After several 
scenes during which Hardy and Adele attempt to convince the down-and-out 
Junuh to play in the match, perhaps even to recapture the position he won as 
a young man  the best golfer in the South  Junuh decides to give it a 
swing.
So the stage is set for the two-day exhibition, $10,000 for the prize, with 
the bigger stake being, of course, Junuh's soul.
Will Smith nicely underplays the mysterious caddy of the film's title.  
Vance appears suddenly and speaks with such nonchalance and self-assurance 
that Junuh hires him without knowing anything of his background.  Though the 
rhetoric he spreads is sometimes pure corn, Smith is able to keep his 
character likable if not believable.  A problem with the title character is 
that he is too much without a history, and we never know him well enough to 
view him as a real human.  On the other hand, director Robert Redford and 
screenwriter Jeremy Leven never elevate him into the realm of magic;  Bagger 
is apparently not some genie sidekick that has no life aside from the wishes 
of his master.
At the heart of the argument that this film is mediocre is its failure to 
create a spirit of enthusiasm and magic.  I have seen THE NATURAL  starring 
Redford, by the way, as Roy Hobbs  and THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is no THE 
NATURAL.  Yes, Redford was older and more experienced than Matt Damon when 
Redford played the main character in Bernard Malamud's mythic baseball opus. 
  But Damon often seems plastic in this role.  Is he trying too hard to 
portray a man shell-shocked out of his former easy manner?  Does his trouble 
result from playing opposite Theron as Adele: a good actress herself trapped 
with an underdeveloped character?  It's hard to tell.  But clearly the film 
lacks the several enchanting moments that a sports drama needs to succeed.
Bruce McGill is good as the semi-slimy Walter Hagen, a spoiled sports figure 
ahead of his time.  Further, the handsome Joel Gretsch is very convincing as 
the Renaissance man Bobby Jones, his determination clear in his glare.  And 
a nice discovery is J. Michael Montcrief as Hardy Greaves, the young 
narrator.  Hardy supplies both comic relief and the innocence necessary to 
make the golf-as-way-of-life hokum even a little believable.  Jack Lemon is 
Hardy as a senior golfer, who opens and closes the film;  too bad Lemon is 
underused in the frame, though his voice is welcome in many parts of the 
long story.
Cinematography is strong in THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE.  The exteriors are 
beautiful, the golf course, the woods, even the haze of the battlefield in 
the brief warfare scenes.  A couple of shots smack of computer generation, 
as when we assume the viewpoint of Junuh's golf ball as it sails toward the 
green.  And I could swear the bank of a lake looked plastic and unnatural as 
well.  These vantages are not bad, but neither do they make more convincing 
the events that the story tries so hard to make astounding.
In the end the film is mildly satisfying, and would be a nice choice for a 
rental.  As a sports movie I would place it on a par with another athletic 
flick out now, REMEMBER THE TITANS, and well ahead of Keven Costner's 
baseball debacle, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.

2000 - 127 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for sexual situations, mild war violence, and profanity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 4, 2000.
With a cast that includes Matt Damon (1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), Will 
Smith (1998's "Enemy of the State"), and Charlize Theron (1997's "Devil's 
Advocate"), and the classy Robert Redford (1998's "The Horse Whisperer") at 
the directing helm, "The Legend of Bagger Vance," based upon the novel by 
Steven Pressfield, has all of the pedigree to be a gorgeously photographed, 
thoughtful, low-key character drama. After sifting through all 127 minutes of 
it, however, at least I can still say it is well photographed. Director 
Redford has created a slow-moving, occasionally tedious film set in the Great 
Depression of the early 1930s, and then deals with none of the hardships or 
issues that went along with the time period, instead opting to weave a sort 
of half-hearted fantasy that is rarely ever involving.
Following the untimely death of her father, wealthy Savannah heiress Adele 
Invergordon (Charlize Theron), in an attempt to avoid foreclosure of the 
country club that is owned by her family, creates a huge golf tournament 
between pros Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) with 
the grand prize being a whopping $10,000. Searching for a third player who 
will stand for the great city of Savannah itself, the town elects the 
services of one Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), a once-great golfer and WWI vet 
(not to mention Adele's ex-lover) who has slid into obscurity in the 
backwoods of Savannah, spending his nights drinking his life away with a 
group of poker buddies.
While on the golf course one night mourning the loss of his swing and 
debating whether to accept the offer to compete in the tournament, Rannulph 
meets Bagger Vance (Will Smith), an honest mystery man who becomes his 
personal muse (and caddie). Setting out to help Rannulph find himself once 
again through the game he used to love so much, Bagger seems to be dedicating 
his whole being to aiding in Rannulph's personal redemption, but who exactly 
is he? And where did he come from?
Opening with a silly wraparound sequence (featuring Jack Lemmon), and then 
leading into a neverending narration that resembles a cheesy history lesson 
on WWI and the troubles in the south, it isn't until nearly the twenty-minute 
mark that "The Legend of Bagger Vance" finds its footing. For a director as 
skilled as Robert Redford, whose "The Horse Whisperer" pulled you into its 
story from the very beginning, this noticeable flaw could have easily been 
corrected. Instead, it comes off as sloppy filmmaking.
The potentially intriguing (if overworn) issue of race relations in the 
south, circa 1930, is overlooked, bypassed for a tale that is deeply 
sugarcoated and unconvincing. Whether Redford wanted to make a realistic 
drama or a reality-based fantasy, there is no excuse for not even making a 
mention of the fact that Bagger Vance is a black man. Had he shown up in 
Savannah, Georgia in the midst of the Great Depression, it is a given that he 
wouldn't have exactly been welcomed with open arms by the townspeople, and he 
certainly would not have been allowed to act as a caddie on a ritzy country 
club resort. Furthermore, the subplot about the Great Depression that has 
recently befallen on Savannah acts as a cheap plotting device, instead of a 
thoughtful part of the story.
Lest it seem that there is nothing to recommend in "The Legend of Bagger 
Vance," it should be noted that this is definitely not the case. While the 
characters aren't exactly poster children for three-dimensionality, the 
actors are good enough that they easily overcome the snags. Matt Damon is 
believable as the internally lost Rannulph Junuh, even if we never get a full 
sense of why he has disappeared into a little, black hole, while Will Smith's 
sweet-faced Bagger acts as a fitting partner to Rannulph. Smith's role is 
unchallenging, but he does what he can with it, and it's nice to see him 
appearing in a film void of aliens and shoot-'em-ups. And Charlize Theron, as 
the conflicted Adele, is very good, perhaps the standout in the cast. 
Impassioned, subtly funny, and strong-willed, Theron knows how to light up 
the screen, and deserves a leading role soon.
Also effective is the romantic relationship between Rannulph and Adele. With 
only a small amount of time dedicated to this subplot, Damon and Theron 
successfully convince us of their strong past relationship, and screenwriter 
Jeremy Leven makes every line of his smart dialogue count.
What "The Legend of Bagger Vance" comes down to is its climactic fourth round 
in the golf tournament, with Rannulph pacing just behind his two competitors. 
Manipulative, more than a little implausible, but with beautiful 
cinematography (by Michael Ballhaus), to boot, it sums up the entire film. 
The outcome of the contest may be a little surprising, but getting to that 
point is a battle in itself.

  From the opening shot of (uncredited) Jack Lemmon reaching for a club, muttering, "Why do I play a game that's destined to kill me?," you know you're in for a magical, mystical golf metaphor. Through flashbacks and Lemmon's narration, the story of his childhood idol, Rannulph Junuh, unfolds. Junuh was the greatest golfer in Savannah, Georgia, until he went off to W.W. I and returned home, disillusioned and depressed. The golden boy had lost his "authentic swing." After that, it took a high-stakes exhibition tournament with Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, the two greatest pros of the Depression-era, and a dose of reality from a philosophical caddie, Bagger Vance, to help him find redemption and get back in the groove, not to mention back in the arms of his spunky fiance. As the guardian angel Bagger, Will Smith steals the picture, ruminating wisely on overcoming adversity. Originally, director Robert Redford was to play Junuh, opposite Morgan Freeman. Too bad he didn't.!
 Damon's a charming if bland, young Redford clone, and an original is always preferable to an imitator. On the other hand, Charlize Theron is beguiling, as is young J. Michael Moncrief. The problem: Jeremy Leven's screenplay, based on Steven Pressfield's novel, has too little backstory to evoke an emotional investment in the characters. But the production values are admirable: credit cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, designer Stuart Craig, costumer Judianna Makovsky, visual effects supervisor Richard Chuang and editor Hank Corwin. Too bad composer Rachel Portman's music goes over-the-top, as when a religious choir heralds a hole-in-one in the 3rd round. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Legend of Bagger Vance" is a spiritual 7. Like life, golf  "is a game that can't be won, only played."
