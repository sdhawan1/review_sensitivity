   If you're a teen living in a town that has one road, a
couple of taverns, no movie houses and no tourists or anyone
from the outside communities to stimulate change, what do
you do?  The usual activity seems to be (if you're a girl) to
get pregnant and if you're a guy to put gals in the family way.
After all, leaving for the big city is not an option if you're so
isolated you barely know that urban areas such as Montreal
and Toronto exist--and New York is something somewhere
down there "in the States."  Allan Moyle's quirky movie
scripted by Tricia Fish (who claims that the story is in no way
autobiographical) is about such a dreary town which, despite
its being right on the ocean, is about as scenic as the South
Bronx.  "New Waterford Girl" opened up the Blame Canada!
festival at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and will
presumably play at some art houses later.  Though the movie
is idiosyncratic, it is not done in the style of, say, Justin
Kerrigan's energetic "Human Traffic"--which deals with 20-
somethings grooving on weekends after putting in time on
their stultifying jobs.
   While Hollywood movies made in Canada--particularly in
Vancouver--have often been losers, the Canadians
themselves seem incapable of turning out a bad product. 
"New Waterford Girl" is in no way destined to become the
next "Titanic" but the picture is a cute study of a dysfunctional
family living in the stixiest of stix towns way out in the
Eastern Canadian island of Cape Breton (in the province of
Nova Scotia, I believe). 
   Mooney Pottie is the eponymous New Waterford Girl, a 15-
year-old who is moody more than Mooney and one who
bears evidence to the possibility that no matter how isolated
and inbred a location may be, there's always someone who
does not fit in.  In her fairly large family, everyone but
Mooney is happy, or at least so thinks her dad, and he'll be
darned if he's going to allow a strange bird like her to go to
New York where she has just won an all expenses paid
scholarship.  She has to find a way to convince the old man
to let her out of this prison, so she latches on to a regular
tradition.   Whenever a girl is knocked up, she is sent by
train--which looks like the Toonerville Trolley--to the town of
Sydney or thereabouts to spend a few days getting an abortion,
and then to return, her reputation intact.  If she can convince
pop that she has a bun in the oven, he will be the first to put
her on that train--except that she will be stateside bound and
as virginal as the day she was born.
   Moyle gets good performances out of the ensemble and
knows how to employ irony with the young people so that the
boys--and not the girls--are the ones worried about their
reputations.  Injecting a catalyst into the action, Moyle
introduces a hip teen from the Bronx whose dad is
incarcerated, implying that she and her mom (Tara Spencer-
Nairn and Cathy Moriarty) are mafia people on the run.  As
the town teacher, Cecil Sweeney--who is in love with his
gifted but isolated student Moonie--Andrew McCarthy does a
surprising turn as a former brat-packer who has matured into
a sensitive adult; a flawed educator who is goodhearted
enough to encourage the object of his desire flee the coop. 
"New Waterford Girl" is a slow-moving, sensitive coming of
age with considerable irony and humor who is the first to
leave her "Margaret's Museum" town, and the sharp-looking
Tara Spencer-Nairn uses some slightly magical powers to aid
in Mooney's liberation.

Confession time: though I live in Newfoundland, I don't watch many 
Canadian movies. This is not exactly by choice -- the simple fact of the 
matter is that Canadian films make up an exceedingly small fraction of 
those shown at local theatres. Indeed, the only Canadian picture which 
showed locally during the first half of 2000 was "Misery Harbour", a 
co-production with Swedish, Norwegian and Danish firms.
The reason for this, I guess, is that Canadian cinema has a reputation 
for being very "artsy" and inaccessible. In my admittedly limited 
experience, I haven't seen a lot to dissuade me from that opinion. Like 
it or not, audiences in general prefer more mainstream fare, and until 
Canadian filmmakers accept this, the situation isn't likely to change.
Fortunately, at least one Canadian movie this year does fit the 
"mainstream" bill -- and without sacrificing its artistic integrity. That 
movie is "New Waterford Girl", fresh from the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, 
set in the coal-mining town of New Waterford, on Cape Breton island in 
Nova Scotia. For the geographically-challenged amongst you, Cape Breton 
lies about 60 miles across the Cabot Strait from the south-west corner of
Newfoundland, and its culture and atmosphere share a lot in common with 
this province. Consequently, I could easily relate to much of the 
material -- the accents and attitudes found in New Waterford are not 
dissimilar from many outport Newfoundland communities.
That said, "New Waterford Girl" is a movie for everyone, not just 
Atlantic Canadians. I do wonder, though, how many Mainlanders will 
recognise the pinpoint accuracy of the seemingly exaggerated portrayal of 
a rural Maritimes community. (If you don't know whether you're a 
Mainlander, trust me, you are one.)
New Waterford in the 1970s is an isolated, conservative town where 
Catholicism is still a vital part of everyday life. Fifteen year-old 
Mooney Pottie (Liane Balaban) is a talented artist, but has resigned 
herself to a life of limited possibilities. When her eccentric high 
school teacher (Andrew McCarthy) secures her a full scholarship to 
prestigious New York art school, Mooney is initially exuberant. But her 
family, including father Francis (Nicholas Campbell), mother Cookie (Mary 
Walsh) and four siblings, are horrified at the prospect of Mooney leaving 
New Waterford, convinced that no good will befall her.
Into this desperate milieu arrive Lou Benzoa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) and her 
mother Midge (Cathy Moriarty), the Potties' new next-door neighbours. 
They come from the Bronx, where Lou's ex-boxer father got into some sort 
of hot water with the law. Despite being treated with suspicion by the 
locals ("You're not Catholic?"), the free-spirited Lou falls in love with 
New Waterford and quickly befriends Mooney, reinvigorating her dreary 
life. With Lou's help, Mooney concocts a scandalous scheme to escape New 
Waterford by ruining her own virginal reputation and then claiming she's
pregnant. This will ensure a trip to Antigonish (on the Nova Scotia 
mainland) to have the purported baby, from where she can travel to New 
York before anyone is the wiser.
Although the story of "New Waterford Girl" is fairly typical 
coming-of-age fare, rarely has this sort of tale been told with such 
delicious humor. The script, by Tricia Fish, is peppered with lovely 
moments. Witness the scene where Mooney feebly "tries out" for the 
national high jump team, for example, and patiently explains that her 
poor performance was because "these aren't my normal shoes". Delightfully 
inventive is a subplot in which Lou discovers that pugilism runs in her 
blood and becomes the enforcer for the lovelorn ladies of New Waterford. 
Only a climactic boxing match feels contrived.
There is also a certain authenticity to the proceedings: the teens of New 
Waterford get drunk and make out and argue with their families just like 
young people really do. There is little of the exaggerated behaviour that 
often characterises these sorts of movies; at times "New Waterford Girl" 
has an almost documentary feel.
The direction by Allan Moyle ("Pump Up The Volume") is very capable, 
abetted by Derek Rogers' cinematography. The stark, uncompromising beauty 
of the Cape Breton coastline is depicted superbly, without making the 
movie feel like a travelogue. The only tech problem is the sound, which
sometimes results in indistinct dialogue.
But "New Waterford Girl"'s biggest asset is its cast, excellent almost 
without exception. Newcomer Liane Balaban is a real find, looking not 
unlike Natalie Portman and -- more importantly -- with acting skills to 
match. Her Mooney is a wonderful character, neither too cynical nor too 
pitiable, and with a palpable intelligence. Mooney's scheme to fake 
pregnancy could have come across as goofy, but the conviction Balaban 
brings to the role makes it work.
Spencer-Nairn's Lou provides a good contrast, vivacious and daring. 
Mooney can't wait to get out of Cape Breton; Lou enjoys New Waterford, a 
welcome change from timeworn plot of the big city kid who moves to a 
small town and loathes it. Spencer-Nairn has terrific chemistry with 
Balaban and a real presence onscreen. The only thing that mars her 
performance is that the film seems to conveniently forget its implication 
that the Benzoas are on the run. That Lou seems utterly dismissive of the 
fact struck me as hard to swallow.
Amongst the supporting players, veteran actors Campbell ("Da Vinci's 
Inquest") and Walsh ("CODCO", "This Hour Has 22 Minutes") are grand as 
Mooney's parents, evoking both desperation and honest caring when 
confronted with Mooney's situation. As for the two big-name Hollywood 
actors, Moriarty is rather underutilised, but McCarthy delivers a 
laudable low-key performance.
It's unfortunate that more people don't have the chance right now to see 
"New Waterford Girl" (it's making its way only slowly across Canada, and 
the producers have yet to secure a US distribution deal so it will 
probably be confined to festivals). It is a touching and funny movie, and 
marks the start of a very promising career for Balaban. As "New Waterford 
Girl" ably demonstrates, Canadian cinema is alive and well. I, for one, 
am eager to see more of it.
