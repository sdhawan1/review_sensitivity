Those who know me well know that for the past few weeks I have been
obsessing with GO, the new film from Doug Liman, the director of
SWINGERS. No, it wasn't because I thought SWINGERS was all that great;
infact, I liked it, but I thought it ended too abruptly.
It all started a couple months ago when I picked up my latest issue of
Entertainment Weekly and began reading Owen Gleiberman's thoughts on
the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. In the article, Gleiberman spent a
page writing about GO, which he compared with PULP FICTION, arguably
my favorite film, without showing any signs of flinching.  So needless
to say, the film had caught my attention. Then I read on and found out
that the film starred Katie Holmes, who is one of the most beautiful
young women on television, and Sarah Polley, who should have won an
Oscar for her heartbreaking performance in THE SWEET HEREAFTER(the
best film of 1997).
Then, a few weeks later, I saw the trailer for GO. Wow, I thought,
this movie is gonna be a rush. Yes, a rush. I mean, they showed raves,
gunfights, British guys, beautiful women, and a car driving wildly on
the Las Vegas strip while blasting a newly mixed version of "Magic
Carpet Ride." I guess you could say I was not in any position to be
let down.
Just a few weeks ago, another film was compared by many critics to
PULP FICTION, compelling one critic to say it is the first film to
actually riff on PULP FICTION without feeling derivative. This British
import, called LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, was also being
compared to TRAINSPOTTING, another favorite of mine.  So, like any
diehard movie buff, I saw it opening weekend, and was disappointed out
of my mind. Not derivative? My ass!
So, in conclusion to my introduction, I expected GO to disappoint
me. I didn't let anyone know, as pretended I was still in my rush as I
sat down to see the film. The film had already given me trouble this
rainy day(and the night before, as it was sold out, forcing me to see
the new Drew Barrymore film) ,as I took the bus to an area not too
close to where I live, just to see the film at the matinee
showing. But, no, the clerk wouldn't sell me a ticket, because I'm
well under 17 and he just happened to notice.  Hello?! Mr.  Clerk, do
you know how much I've been obsessing over this film!!! I could hear
the GO gods laughing at me from above. They knew about my obsession,
about how much I needed to see the film before my spring break runs
out on me.
So, the next thing I know, the rain comes pouring down on me out of
nowhere.  I felt like Truman Burbank when he finds out the rain only
falls on him. Yes, the rain was for me, only for me! I went back home,
after waiting outside for the bus for at least half an hour.  My dad
then offered to take me to the 4 o'clock show at a close theatre.
Obviously, I would go.
So we get to the theatre, and the film is sold out. Luckily(haha), we
bought tickets to the 5 o'clock show, and went home to kill time
before the show. So then, I went back to the theatre, suffered through
20 trailers, and finally, the experience began...
If you actually think I can muster up enough strength to spell out the
entire plot of GO for you, then you obviously don't know me. Why don't
you just go see the movie??? If you want the plot, go read another
review. Well, I'll tell you this much. GO's plot is PULP FICTIONesque
to a certain degree, but the plot is basically RASHOMON, with four
people discussing one Christmas eve from each of their points of
view. There is sex, murder, drugs and more.
Needless to say, I was in no way disappointed by GO. The film is a
trip, a rush, an overall blast. I doubt a more entertaining film will
hit theatres this year.  Doug Liman mixes elements of PULP FICTION,
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, and TRAINSPOTTING into one big melting
pot. So, it's derivative. And the script by John August isn't witty
enough to be entirely comedic. And there isn't anything in the film
that is close to what I'd call depth, whereas PULP FICTION got depth
out of pure originality. I was a little let down by the fact that I
was hoping GO would be the quintessential film for the 90's, but
actually it kind of is. If nothing else, the 90's were fun and
entertaining.  How's that for depth? So, in conclusion, stop comparing
films to PULP FICTION. It's just not worth disappointing people.

"Go" really earns its "R" rating and I like that. The film 
unapologetically presents amoral characters, recreational drug use, 
marginally-sympathetic dope dealers and young people having sex with 
strangers, along with nudity, violence, gunplay and a car chase that 
actually packs some oomph, all set against a low-rent backdrop of L.A. 
raves and tacky Las Vegas glitz. This "Pulp Fiction Lite" wallows in 
recklessness and, in these oh-so-responsible times, there's something 
perversely refreshing about that.
For his second feature, "Swingers" director Doug Liman, working from 
newcomer John August's screenplay, weaves together three stories that 
spring from a single encounter at a grocery store. After following one 
plotline for roughly 30 minutes, he returns to the initial setting to 
launch into the second tale, then repeats the technique for the third, 
which flows into a conclusion that more or less wraps up all three 
stories. The fragmented, non-linear technique is ambitious and not 
altogether successful, but offers more than enough satisfying moments to 
make up for its weak points. 
A big part of the fun in "Go" comes from the film's many surprises, so 
I'll keep the plot description as bare-bones as possible. It begins at a 
Los Angeles grocery, where checkout clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) spends the 
Christmas holiday season working overtime, trying to earn enough money to 
avoid eviction from her apartment. Reluctantly, she agrees to work a 
shift for Simon (Desmond Askew), so he can vacation in Las Vegas with 
friends. Then soap opera actors Zack and Adam (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) 
show up at the store to buy drugs from Simon. 
Plotline A begins when the entrepreneurial Ronna decides to make some 
extra cash by handling the drug deal herself. With two pals in tow, she 
visits Simon's dealer, Todd (Timothy Olyphant), leaving her friend Claire 
(Katie Holmes) as collateral while she conducts the business. Things go 
very wrong, leading her to pursue a risky backup plan at a nearby rave. 
Plotline B follows Simon and his buddies to Las Vegas, where some 
remarkably bad decisions result in a wild, and quite entertaining, chase 
scene. Plotline C chronicles the travails of Zack and Adam when they 
become involved with an extremely intense police officer (William 
Fichtner) and his equally bizarre wife (Jane Krakowski).
Ronna's storyline works primarily because of a hilarious depiction of 
life from the perspective of a kid whacked out on Ecstasy, and the 
considerable talents of Sarah Polley and Timothy Olyphant, two actors 
with wonderfully expressive eyes. Polley, so good in "The Sweet Hereafter,
" is compelling here, managing to look defeated and determined 
simultaneously, and Olyphant proves adroit at blending a menacing stance 
with an off-kilter sexiness. Interestingly, "Dawson Creek's" Katie Holmes,
 the closest thing this film has to a traditionally nice character, is 
also the blandest. 
The center story, focusing on the misadventures of Simon and his buddies 
in Las Vegas, provides the juiciest action and biggest laughs. Breckin 
Meyer is a hoot as Tiny, a Caucasian kid trying his damnedest to be black 
("If you were any whiter, you'd be clear," snaps one of his friends), but 
the lion's share of the time is given to Simon and Marcus (Taye Diggs), 
whose trip to the Crazy Horse strip club turns into a riotous flight from 
a vengeful father and son. Director Liman, who dealt with Las Vegas and 
male bonding in "Swingers," seems most comfortable handling this segment, 
effortlessly blending repartee and action scenes. Desmond Askew and Taye 
Diggs make a great comic team, with Simon's skittering impulsiveness and 
Marcus' Tantric efforts at serenity balancing out beautifully. 
The third storyline, featuring Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf, suffers by 
comparison. The couple's situation demands that they be nervous, but I 
still found their stammering and furtive glances tiresome. Thankfully, 
William Fichtner and Jane Krakowski are a scream, exuding a deliciously 
ominous forced peppiness during a tense dinner scene with the boys. The 
husband and wife clearly have an agenda beyond sharing Christmas cheer, 
and the payoff is memorable. 
Of the countless movies patterned after "Pulp Fiction" (it's hard to 
believe that only five years have passed since Quentin Tarantino turned 
contemporary cinema upside down with that film), "Go" is the best one yet,
 due to Liman's assured direction, coupled with a well-constructed script,
 a generally strong cast, great editing and effective use of music. Is 
the film a triumph of style over substance? Of course, but this genre is 
based on the pursuit of style over everything. Had the characters been 
more substantial, their nihilistic behavior would have been hard to take, 
and in "Go," nastiness and irresponsibility is half the fun.

It's 3AM.  Do you know where your children are?  Well-hidden and tucked
beneath the cosmopolitan Los Angeles landscape exists a breed of
youngsters who do what they can to scrape by for their survival.  They
roam within deteriorating communities awash in the neon lights of porn
shops and the blue and red blinking lights of passing police cars.  For
some, like Ronna and Claire, they are underpaid checkout girls at the
local supermarket within their much-in-need-of beautification
neighborhood.  Their friend includes Simon, who is a small time drug
dealer.  Their hardened childhoods have made them street smart,
resourceful, and desperate.  Kids like this don't think, they just do. 
They just go.
`Go' is an off-centered comedy that employs quirky sex and violence in
an environment filled with drugs, rave dances, and strange
conversations about pop culture.   There are three scenarios that
illustrate how a simple decision puts them on a path that will cause
their already unfocused lives to spin further out of control.  The
first one focuses on Ronna (Sarah Polley).  She is facing eviction, and
unless she can generate rent money in a night, she'll be thrown out. 
Her plan involves Simon's drug distributor.  But she can't anticipate
the situation that she's walking into.  Her situation is made worse by
her accomplice who is tripping out on a powerful hallucinogen during
the height of the problem.
The second story features Simon, who is a young, brash, and libidinous
teenager on his first trip to Las Vegas.  His wide-eyed curiosity is
bound to get him into a lot of trouble.  For example, accompanied by
his friend to a topless bar, he is warned not to get a bottle of
champagne (a very expensive invitation for a private lap dance), which
he naturally does.  Their situation also spins out of control, and as
they make their escape, another friend being filled in on the details
exclaims, `you mean you stole a car, shot a bouncer and had sex with
two girls at the same time?'  There's another story that focuses on two
men.  Their vignette revolves around elements of gayness and a humorous
poke at the multi-level marketing structure of Amway, but their
inclusion into the overall story line is to show that even responsible
adults can get themselves into bizarre situations where their may be no
way out.  
The film's structure involves an interlocking timeline, where we
revisit certain scenes more than once.  When we do, we'll be revisiting
the same time period through the eyes of a different person.  All of
these varied stories cleverly converge.  This is certainly a
well-structured movie.  I liked the depiction of the drug euphoria,
which was like being underwater where sights and sounds are severely
distorted.  I'm not condoning drug use, but did enjoy the stylish
visualization, depicted as a wild Macarena-like sequence in the produce
section of a supermarket and a telepathic cat.   There are many offbeat
characters that lend energy to this film.  I also liked how these kids'
lives were symbolized and the general atmosphere of the film.  When the
frenzied activities of the previous night finally ends, the next thing
that they want to is only as clear as the cover of the morning fog. 
But these kids are scrappy, and they'll find a way to survive.

Freeman, Nathan Bexton, Jane Krakowski, James Duval, Courtland Mead.
1999 - 100 minutes
Rated R (for violence, profanity, nudity, sex, and drug use).
Reviewed April 10, 1999.
Doug Liman's "Go" is a glittery, flashy, and fast-paced dark 
comedy-thriller in the obvious style of Quentin Tarantino. Although the 
basic outline is completely different, both films feature off-beat and 
interesting dialogue; several dispicible, if very funny, characters; and 
the same invigorating non-linear storytelling techniques.
Set entirely on Christmas Eve and early Christmas morning in L.A., "Go" 
begins with a jolt as we are treated to quick flashes of a rave before 
the Columbia logo is even finished. We then move on to the stories at 
hand. Ronna is a 20-year-old grocery story worker who is threatened to 
be evicted from her apartment if she doesn't come up with enough money 
soon. Accepting to take a double-shift when her English co-worker, Simon 
(Desmond Askew), goes on a trip to Las Vegas, Ronna finally sees a light 
at the end of the tunnel when two of her customers, Zack (Jay Mohr) and 
Adam (Scott Wolf), approach her about scoring some ecstacy. Agreeing to 
sell them some, Ronna sets off to see Todd (Timothy Olyphant), a drug 
dealer, but when she doesn't have enough money to pay him for the pills, 
she forces her friend, Claire (Katie Holmes), to stay with him as 
colateral. As predicted, things don't go quite as planned.
Switching back to the opening of the film, we now follow Simon on his 
wild trip to Las Vegas with his three buddies (Taye Diggs, Breckin 
Meyer, and James Duval), where he runs into problems after sleeping with 
two strangers, causing a large fire, and breaking the "no-touch" rule 
when he hires a stripper to dance for Marcus (Diggs) and him.
The last story involves Zack and Adam, two soap opera actors, who 
unwittingly find themselves having Christmas dinner with a sexually 
determined cop (William Fichtner) and his oddball wife (Jane Krakowski). 
These three tales, as well as several enjoyable and well-written 
subplots, one in which involves the unexpected romantic coupling of 
good-girl Claire and the shady Todd, all inevitably careen and cross 
paths with each other by the film's end, but many of the plot 
developments really are genuinely surprising and satisfying. 
There are many pleasures to be had in "Go," but one of the greatest 
satisfactions is in the unorthodox way that the film is made, as it 
actually leaves it up to you to use your mind and follow all of the 
feuding stories. You rarely see this in a wide-release film, and 
sometimes it can be distracting, but "Go" moves so smoothly through time 
that it was almost impossible not to get caught up in the proceedings. 
Not only that, but I am the type of person who especially loves to 
discover films without having the outcome be telegraphed well in 
advance. Here, there is no way to figure out how everything is going to 
turn out, and it was this anticipation that involved me even more. John 
August should be personally thanked for writing the sharp-witted and 
entertaining screenplay, which, at a swift 100 minutes, gives the 
characters enough time to have many intriguing conversations and 
distinguish themselves with each other.
In the acting department, I doubt a superior young cast could have been 
possibly executed, and this was an impressive career move for all 
involved. Giving the best performance is Katie Holmes, who also has 
likability on her side since she is, perhaps, the only non-slimy 
character in the whole film. Not only that, but Holmes really does prove 
how promising she is as an actress, as the words in the superb 
screenplay effortlessly roll out of her mouth like wildfire. Also 
particular standouts are Sarah Polley, so much different than her 
sympathetic parapalegic role in 1997's "The Sweet Hereafter," and Taye 
Diggs, who sparks all of his scenes to life (as if the movie didn't 
already have enough life to it!).
Although "Go" may appear from the television ads like it is another
 teen-oriented movie, it really isn't at all. In fact, the youngest 
character is probably around nineteen or twenty, and the age group goes 
all the way up to one central character who is in his forties. 
Thankfully, there's no high school in sight, nor is there a prom, or a 
cliched plot.
Director Doug Liman made a splash in 1996 with his indie film, 
"Swingers," starring Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, and he actually 
improves upon that film to bring us something more assured and complex. 
Kudos also go out to the gritty cinematography by Liman himself, which 
is a spectacle to see (particularly the rave scenes), and the 
perfectly-assembled soundtrack, with the song, "New," by No Doubt, 
making a big impression. A goofy, hilarious sequence has another of 
Ronna's friends (Nathan Bexton) hallucinating from taking a hit of 
ecstacy and imagining that he is dancing with a grocery story customer 
to the Macarena song.
If there is a problem with "Go," it is the same problem I had with the 
slightly superior "Pulp Fiction," which is that for all of its 
intricacies, the movie ultimately doesn't really lead up to much. The 
twists and turns are sorted out, yes, but what I mean is that nothing 
much is solved, as everything simply circles around in time. 
Fortunately, the performances, direction, screenplay, and impressive 
technical aspects work together as a solid unit to make the exciting 
journey to nowhere a great deal of fun. In short, "Go" really does, 
well, go!

 One of the times I mentioned that Jean-Luc Godard is a seminal filmmaker,
someone exclaimed" I didn't know he was an American Indian!" Loved it. Also
love Godard's paradoxes. As when, in his earlier days, his screen
audacities made a puzzled viewer ask: "But Monsieur  Godard, don't you
think that a film must have a beginning, a middle, and an end?"
"Absolutely," quoth JLG "but not necessarily in that order."
Which is what "Go" (as in Godard) does, and goes one step beyond. It is in
three sections where many key  characters are the same, but with the
"weight" of their roles variously distributed, as the three sections take
place at the same time.There's a soupcon  here of "Rashomon" seen through a
glass darkly.
The settings are primarily Los Angeles and secondarily Las Vegas-- on
Christmas Eve. A fine match, since Vegas, a city-show (cf.city-state) has
an ethos and a aesthetic which are no doubt appreciated by much of the
Angelenian Kultur and,as the Russians say, its "nyekulturnyi."
I admit that I find Christmas in California funny. Perhaps because I have
spent much time where Christmas is "real" and not X-mas: in the cold
Midwest, as well as abroad where even in mild climates late December is
persuasive. I know it makes no sense, as the source event did not happen in
northern latitudes --but still, X-mas in LA. is comical.
In "Go", the main connecting thread is, arguably, Sarah Polley, a performer
who can be three-dimensional in two-dimensional roles. She plays Ronna, a
check-out grocery clerk obviously,and understandably bored with her job.
Her co-workers and friends are Katie Holmes (as Claire) whose looks remind
me of Christina Ricci's; and the Brit in America Desmond Askew (as the
goofy Simon).
Claire is essentially a tag-along comparse, Simon is a relative newcomer to
the Star-Spangled nation. His fits the bill and the scene perfectly. He's
learned all he knows about the USA from movies, is into drug-dealing and
fast-living. Note that Askew, the name of the actor, is most apt to the
character of Simon.
Simon, intent on visiting Vegas, asks Ronna to take his place in a deal of
buying and reselling about two dozen Ecstasy tabs. This may not be her
forte, but she accepts because she's  broke and about to be evicted from
her lodgings. I won't reveal the first section of the movie, except to say
that it leads to wild and woolly adventures for Ronna.
While this is going on, in what we have to call Part II, Simon and friends
drive to Vegas. The team is a colorful one, especially Simon and the chic
and savvy  Marcus (played by Taye Diggs). Marcus,who is black, has some of
the best reactions in the film, especially when it comes to others'
unconscious (?) racism.
Vegas yields some quite amusing scenes: Simon's having simultaneous sex
with two girls met at a Jewish wedding where he wandered in; starting up a
hotel fire; getting blackmailed by a little boy next door;  stealing of a
resplendent Ferrari; an encounter with strippers that blows into to a
fracas, a shooting and the pals being chased by a father-and-son duo in an
SUV.
Improbabilities abound, especially during the car duel and the
incompatibility in width between the SUV some alleys. But it is all very
kinetic, inventive, and, for many viewers, great fun.
Part III, back in LA, concentrates on two young TV actors of soapers, and
police detective Burke, who's wired them .We had met all three  in Part I
as potential drug customers. Burke forcefully invites the boys for dinner
at his home, where they meet his sexy, horny wife. The near-result is laden
with sex, homo and hetero, but by implication rather than graphics. The
end-result, which I have to reveal,  is that the host couple has an
additional income from being representatives for an Amway clone company.
What they really want from the boys is to recruit new salesmen. Hilarious.
"Go" was to be a short film of just Part I, but when director Liman scored
with his first feature (Swingers, 1996) it was expanded. The genealogy of
Liman's works is something like this:
Decades ago, the Warner Bros. Studios begat films noirs. In them humor
often resided, but rather incidentally. (See The Maltese Falcon, or
Casablanca which admittedly is not noir)
These, developing in tortuous ways, eventually begat neo-noir, much of it
with stepped up humor, which in turn produced the Coen Bros and such.
Technology begat videos,video-stores --and some movie-drunk employees. This
begat Quentin Tarantino, who spawned followers and imitators, dull,
gauche, inspired, with others yet , as in "Go," de-noiring a great deal and
placing the funny stuff at center stage.
"Go", even when not dissected, is "deja vu all over again." But it's not
pure copy-cat-ism. It very own twists, tricks and treats, inventions, big
and small touches,may not give it a Ph.D. in originality but are worth an
M.A. as they also bring to the movie a feel of lively improvisation.The
energy level is high:  go! go ! go!  all the way.
This brings us to the mysterious lack of an exclamation mark after "Go".
It's not a full injunction to see the film. It does not, like monosyllabic
brand names (Gap, Bic, Mac), try to sell a product nor does it  fully
describe the movie's kinetic nature.Perhaps the makers themselves don't
know. Liman -- who's also his own very good cinematographer--is a jokester,
which may be explanation enough. And the lack of ! calls extra attention to
the film. "Go" also joins level 2 of shortest titles (like "If") though not
level 1(like"M").
The film's subjects (in the plural) and nature, its druggies, sex,
violence, raves and young people, plus a  Gold Medal-winning record of f...
words, will not attract mature audiences. But then Liman and writer August
knew this. They have aimed squarely at the massive youth public which could
well make "Go" a cult movie.

GO *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( go@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Sarah Polley, Desmond Askew, Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf
screenplay by John August
directed by Doug Liman
Go's is a gloriously slick hip machine. Director Liman (who also
photographed Go) and screenwriter August celebrate the drug/rave scene
in L.A., preferring to take (comedic) snapshots of troubled youth
rather than critique them. After more than ninety minutes of
pill-popping, tantric sex, car chases, and attempted murder, Go even
has a happy ending. This is the sort of film that gives members of the
Dove Foundation splitting headaches; as Go wound down, I anticipated
an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder
sermon that (blessedly) didn't arrive.
A la Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Go is comprised of three separate but
related stories. The basics are as follows: Ronna (Polley) is a bitter
grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for
extra dough. Her co-worker, Simon (the improbably named Askew), is a
clubber from Britain ecstatic about his first trip to Vegas.  Zack
(Mohr) and Adam (Wolf) are soap opera stars escaping a
career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop (Fichtner)
in a drug bust. Perhaps because the innovative structure of
Tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat, the id-fueled Go
delighted me but rarely surprised me (with the exception of that
mind-reading cat!); Pulp Fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen, but
we see Go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last.
Torontonian Polley (of The Sweet Hereafter) refused to do publicity
for this picture on the basis that she was "not pleased with" her turn
as the ill-fated cashier. In Go, she delivers, hands-down, her best
performance to date. Here's an (overrated) actress who agreed to
appear on the poster, but not support her team at the junket or in 
interviews; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for Ms. Polley, as
anyone who has read of her political agenda in the Canadian press will
tell you. If she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment, she
should have said "No," not Go.
But I digress. Go is a fun film, so chipperly depraved one can't help
but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride.
In that sense, it's a departure from Liman's last film, Swingers,
which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of Vince
Vaughan's Trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever
epilogue (which has been aped by McDonald's for their latest
commercial). I wish I cared more about Go's characters: like 
the techno music they listen to, the bands of anarchists on display
here are at once absorbing and vacuous. When the lights came up and
stung my eyes, it was difficult to recall what about it entertained
me.
Yet entertain me it did. Go is light and frothy, featuring compelling
if not endearing work by Polley, Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2), and
especially Fichtner, whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective
laughs. Fichtner is a character actor best known for playing
backstabbers (in Heat, Armageddon, and others); his previously
untapped comic abilities shine in Go. Unlike much of the film,
Fichtner is unpredictable.

Almost every weekend now, teen movies are released.  Most of them are mediocre,
such as Ten Things I Hate About You (C+) and Wing Commander (F), but some of
them are very well done, such as Cruel Intentions (A-), Never Been Kissed (A),
and this film.  Once in awhile, just like in this film's case, the film will be
much more than an attempt to bring in money from teenagers.  They will appeal
to not only teens, but adults as well.  That's that way I feel about the film
Go.  This film is from the director Doug Liman, who also directed the hit movie
Swingers, starring Vince Vaughn.  
The film is actually three short films in one.  Each section follows a
different character and what they do on Christmas Eve.  In most cases, drugs
are the main idea.  The first section of the film is entitled "Ronna."  Sarah
Polley stars as Ronna, a rude grocery store worker.  There, she hangs out with
Claire, played by Katie Holmes, Mannie, played by Nathan Bexton, and Simon,
played by Desmond Askew.  All three are really into drugs.  At the grocery
store, two men (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) make a drug deal with Ronna.  Ronna
must get the drugs from a dealer, who also deals for Simon.  The dealer is
Todd, played by Scream 2's (A-) Timothy Olyphant.  She is on her way to a
party, where she makes a lot of money selling allergy medicine to pay back drug
debts.  
Ronna's story is a very interesting one.  Ronna is a very confused character. 
Sarah Polley is very good as the character.  The best character in this story
is Claire.  Katie Holmes is absolutely wonderful as Claire.  Holmes will have a
huge career ahead of her after this film.  Mannie and Simon are not the main
focuses in this story, but they will be seen later on.  Timothy Olyphant is
also superb as Todd.  All of the characters seem very realistic and strange in
this part of the film.
The second section is called "Simon."  We know Simon from earlier, in the story
of "Ronna."  Once again, Desmond Askew plays Simon.  Simon's main hobby is
drugs. Right now, he is in Las Vegas with Marcus, played by How Stella Got Her
Groove Back's Taye Diggs, Singh, played by James Duval, and Tiny, played by
Breckin Meyer.  The three get into big trouble in Vegas, and now they are being
chased by two men who are willing to kill them on the spot.
This part of the film was probably the most unlikable.  Simon is not a very
likable character, but what do expect from a drug crazed maniac?   Askew is
fine as the role, it's just the character.  Taye Diggs was good when he was on
screen, but he didn't get half the screen time he needed to develop his
character.  Meyer and Duval are not seen enough to decide whether they turned
in good performances or not.  
The third and final section is called "Adam and Zack."  These two characters
were seen earlier in the film, during one of the first sequences in the grocery
store.  Adam is played by played by Party of Five's Scott Wolf, and Zack is
played by Playing By Heart's Jay Mohr.  The two are soap opera actors.  This
third section of the film was good.  Mohr turns in a type of performance that I
thought he could never pull off- A non-annoying and even good performance. 
Scott Wolf is also good.
The way Go was done was very impressive.  I really enjoyed the technique, and
especially the way everything tied together in the end.  Maybe the makers of
the film 200 Cigarettes (D) should have used this form if film making, rather
than making the film very confusing.
Another thing that I really loved about Go was the amount of sub-plots it had. 
There was no definitive plot, which gives you a variety of different plots that
are all developed very nicely.  The performances turned out by everyone are
good.  Katie Holmes and Timothy Olyphant are the two performances that are
still in my mind though.  They were both very exceptional and a lot more than I
expected.
Go is a very funny film.  It isn't pure comedy though.  There are a lot of
themes, mainly drugs, that are darker and disturbing.  The drug usage plays a
main part in the film, so I don't think younger teens should see this flick. 
Many sequences are hysterical.  Mannie turns out many laughs after taking too
many drugs.  The sound also adds a lot to the content of the film.  The
soundtrack is fun and fast.  A young teen cast, a fresh soundtrack, and the
funny scenes should make this film a cult hit.  It was much like Trainspotting,
(C+) only a lot more light and fun to watch.  Expect wonderful word of mouth
for this great little film.

     In this cinematic era A.Q. (After Quentin), much film criticism is
filtered through the pop-culture sieve that is Tarantino.  We just can't
seem to help ourselves -- when we're not noting ways Tarantino has cribbed
from his film-making forebears, we're noting the ways his acolytes have
cribbed from him.  A gun can't be fired but his name is invoked; a
conversation can't be peppered with profanity and obscure references but
he becomes an adjective.  When a film like GO appears, so like PULP
FICTION in both narrative structure and style, it's easy to dismiss it on
a comparative basis without discussing why the Tarantino oeuvre has become
the Greenwich Mean Time for an entire genre -- the edgy, after-hours comic
thriller.  It's easy to miss why director Doug Liman's film works in the
ways it understands Tarantino's unique touch, and doesn't work in the ways
it fails to understand. 
     Like PULP FICTION, GO involves several non-chronological yet
intertwined stories of Los Angeles denizens with less than glowing morals.
Ronna (Sarah Polley), a young grocery store clerk, takes the shift of her
co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew) to help pay back rent, then also takes
some of Simon's side business as a drug dealer to help a bit more
substantially.  Her two customers are Zack (Jay Mohr) and Adam (Scott
Wolf), a pair of party animals who may be undercover cops, or perhaps soap
opera actors, or perhaps some interesting combination of the two.  Simon,
meanwhile, is on a road trip to Las Vegas with a trio of pals including
Marcus (Taye Diggs), a road trip which always seems to be just one step
ahead of complete disaster.  These three stories meet, swerve and overlap
through one wild 24-hour period filled with sex, drugs and a pre-Christmas
rave.
     There's something to be said for a film with the ability to grab you
viscerally, which is one of the tricks GO manages to pull off.  That
description isn't just about pacing (though GO moves with the hypnotic
momentum of a rave beat), nor is it just about the level of violence and
action (though there's one kicker of a car chase through Vegas).  Like the
most memorable moments in PULP FICTION, the most memorable moments in GO
energize you with the sense that you're really not sure what's going to
happen next.  At key junctures, you realize that screenwriter John August
is in complete command of his narrative as he turns expectations upside
down in ways that make perfect sense, not just because he can.
     That's not to say that GO doesn't wander off on tangents just because
they might prove to be entertaining.  GO isn't a clean, linear story even
in the most fundamental ways, but it's also a case of a film that doesn't
let the main storyline get in the way of some hilarious distractions:
Ronna's entrepreneurial spirit as she sells her own special brand of pills
at the party; Zack and Adam at a Christmas dinner with ulterior motives;
Simon experimenting with tantric sex with a pair of bridesmaids; the
encyclopedic knowledge of a cat during a hallucinogenic trip.  Like much
of Tarantino's work, it's a loose and sloppy sort of a film, which doesn't
mean that there's no logic to what's going on.  It's just the logic of
giving an audience one heck of a ride, letting the characters stroll and
stray because the film-makers have created an atmosphere where we trust
they'll stroll somewhere interesting.
     Unlike much of Tarantino's work, however, there's not much going on
beneath the glittering surface of GO.  The closest it gets to a thematic
link is the idea that these young people dash into dangerous situations
with little restraint on their desire to...well, to go.  There's nothing
resembling the moral center of PULP FICTION, nor do August and Liman show
nearly as much affection for their flawed, self-absorbed characters.  The
performances are solid even when the chattery dialogue feels a bit forced,
giving us plenty of reason to follow the characters even when they seem
like hopeless screw-ups, but no one is experiencing a fundamental life
change.  GO is a dazzling demonstration of how good even a derivative sort
of film can be when someone grasps the basic principles of engrossing
film-making.  It also demonstrates what we talk about when we talk about
Tarantino -- a way of telling us something about humanity between the
bursts of dialogue and gunfire.

GO by Doug Liman, the director of SWINGERS, is three fast-paced black
comedies for the price of one with each fascinating enough to stand on
its own.  The movie follows one set of characters during the span of a
single night and then backs up to the beginning of the story to follow
another.  With shades of PULP FICTION, VERY BAD THINGS and LOCK, STOCK &
2 SMOKING BARRELS, the movie's hip dialog by John August leaves few dull
moments.  It's proudly crude and vulgar and full of twists as each
group's plans goes horribly awry.
As the story opens, we meet a very bored and broke grocery store clerk,
Ronna, played by Sarah Polley from THE SWEET HEREAFTER.  At the end of
Ronna's extra long shift, another clerk, Simon (Desmond Askew), pays her
to take his just starting shift. Simon, who earns money on the side
dealing drugs, is off to Vegas with some buddies he met in traffic
school.  Just as she looks like she is about to fall asleep on her
grocery scanner, two guys named Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr)
arrive wanting to buy drugs from Simon.  With Simon gone, she decides to
make money by buying drugs from Simon's distributor and selling them to
Adam and Zack.  Nothing will go as planned.
First, we follow Ronna and her clerk buddies as they try to be drug
entrepreneurs without much luck.  They do hit upon a scam whereby they
pass off allergy medicine and aspirin as drugs at a rave.  As in the
lull before the storm, in each of the 3 stories things will start
looking good for the characters just before the hurricane hits.
Next, we backtrack to when Simon cons Ronna into filling in for him.
When he and his smart-mouthed buddies arrive in Vegas, they start having
the time of their lives, complete with private lap dancing sessions,
small orgies and big guns.  (Simon even gets to practice a bizarre
technique known as tantric sex -- don't ask.)  As amateurs, however,
they are way out of their league in Sin City, and some locals prove more
than a match for them.  The director manages to stage the car chases
there in ways that seem fresh, no small feat for such an overused part
of the action drama repertoire.
The final leg backs up to the drug purchase by Adam and Zack, who are
two television actors in trouble with the law.  They have been forced by
the police to go undercover and wear wires in order to entrap Simon.
They have their own set of problems with the worst being a Christmas
dinner with their police boss (William Fichtner) and his wife (Jane
Krakowski), a couple "open to new experiences."
The camerawork is as energetic as the story itself, and the sets are
suitably eclectic with Ronna's car and all of its Christmas lights being
one of the best.
Although most of the movie's gifts are comedic, it does provide some
practical guidance for choosing your next car.  If you're anticipating
the need to transport dead bodies, a Miata is not the car for you.
GO runs 1:40. It is rated R for drug usage, nudity, sex, profanity and
violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
Columbia / 1:43 / 1999 / R (language, violence, strong drug use,
sexuality, glimpses of nudity)
Cast: Sarah Polley; Desmond Askew; Jay Mohr; Scott Wolf;Taye Diggs;
William Fichtner; J.E. Freeman; Katie Holmes; Timothy Olyphant; Jane

Director: Doug Liman
Screenplay: John August
The emphatic title of "Go" alternates as a well-deserved, one-word
recommendation of the movie itself: Don't dawdle, don't deliberate,
don't protest, just _go_. It also functions as a well-deserved, one-word
summary of what happens in the movie: The characters here are constantly
_on_ the go, outrunning disgruntled junkies, angry strip club thugs or
their own mistakes. Slap the double-meanings together and you've got one
seriously wild ride. To pass "Go" would be to deny yourself the rush of
watching fine filmmaking, a truly unpredictable storyline and spirited
acting come together in a fully satisfying whole.
A rush of a different kind accompanies the on-screen action, which
begins with a Ecstasy deal gone horribly awry and paves the way for
trips - literal and figurative - into territory seedier still. A
snowball effect of sorts starts in "Go"'s opening scenes, as
strapped-for-cash supermarket clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) agrees to take
the shift of British co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew) so he can travel to
Las Vegas with his mates and she can hopefully nab enough cash to avoid
being evicted from her Los Angeles pad. How convenient, then, that she
stumbles into an opportunity to make some extracurricular dough via
dabbling in the drug trade.
With a breakneck pace and fine attention to detail, all this is nearly
perfectly realized - and only the first in a series of three separate
but interlocking "chapters" cooked up by debut screenwriter John August.
Bravo to him for keeping momentum dizzily spinning throughout "Go," even
if the influence of Quentin Tarantino is fairly obvious in narrative
structure, a key soundtrack selection and same scenes shown through
several different points-of-view. Could this film have been made without
"Pulp Fiction" or "Reservoir Dogs"? Maybe not. Does that negate its
intoxicating good-time vibe? Definitely not.
Besides, to call "Go" totally Tarantino overlooks its original energy,
style and tone. These assets spark the remaining pair of vignettes,
although they aren't quite up to the challenge of topping Ronna's
hilariously chaotic plight (though the finale comes close). In the
middle section, the focus is on Simon and company, as they recklessly
tear through Sin City and get a nudie bar crew on their bad sides. Then,
a couple of soap stars (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf), significant
role-players in Ronna's quest for excess, spend a bizarre Christmas
dinner with a strange cop (William Fichtner) and his stranger wife (Jane
Krakowski).
That last bit provides "Go"'s biggest laugh, as Fichtner's understated
performance successfully compliments his unforeseeable ulterior motives.
Other MVPs that shine in an already supremely polished cast: Polley,
unfazed and quite the entrepenuer; Katie Holmes as her best bud, cutely
nervous and caustic when issued by Polley as collateral to a dealer;
Timothy Olyphant as the dealer, his dangerous profession and demeanor
hiding the fact that he's a pretty OK guy; Taye Diggs as a suave,
meditative high-roller; and the always engaging Breckin Meyer,
delightfully over-the-top as a crude homeboy-wannabe.
Director Doug Liman went the same route in "Swingers," combining
colorful people, snappy dialogue and a jazzy locale, but "Go" goes his
freshman feature a few better by upping both dramatic urgency and
production values. Most of the plot threads, for example, end up
congregating in a place that would have been way out of "Swingers"'
budget - a seductively glowing, techno-pumping warehouse rave. It's an
ironic setting to bring everything in "Go" together, because this movie
deserves some raves of its own.

GO (Columbia - 1999)
Cast: Desmond Askew, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, J.E. Freeman,
      Katie Holmes, Jane Karkowski, Breckin Meyer, Jay Mohr,
      Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf
Screenplay by John August
Produced by Paul Rosenberg, Mickey Liddell, Matt Freeman
Directed by Doug Liman
Running time: 100 minutes 
Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   Doug Liman's GO is almost the certainly the first film in Columbia
   Pictures' history where its trademark fanfare and torch-bearing
   emblem flickers out to give way to a full-out rave in progress.  It's
   the sort of brazenly confident touch which Liman employs throughout
   the picture, revealing a fearless flashiness previously unseen in his
   breakout debut, SWINGERS.  So frenetic is GO, so aggressively
   energized, it'd be utterly exhausting were it not so exhilirating.
   Wearing its sardonic sense of humour like a badge of honour, the
   snappy screenplay by John August segments the film into three
   interrelated sections running along the same 24-hour timeline and
   careens through them at a breakneck pace.  We meet Ronna (Sarah
   Polley), in desperate need of rent money, who haphazardly engineers a
   drug deal which predictably goes awry.  There's her co-worker Simon
   (Desmond Askew), who embarks on a disasterous misadventure during a
   fling to Las Vegas with friends.  And there's Adam (Scott Wolf) and
   Zack (Jay Mohr), the soap opera actors who instigated the deal with
   Ronna and find themselves stumbling into a strange series of
   quandries.
   The entire film, in fact, is essentially a string of escalating
   situations which comically spin out of control in quirky and
   unexpected ways as its collection of disaffected young characters
   recklessly plow through the night.  While each of the vignettes has a
   slightly different tone -- Adam and Zack's is the most wickedly
   mischievous, while the madcap anarchy in Simon's manic half-hour
   contrasts with the sly deliberation in Ronna's chapter -- they easily
   meld in this lively black comedy where both Liman and his characters
   throw caution to the wind and charge into a pulsating world of
   dangerous chic.
   Despite possessing elements of action and tension, at heart, GO is a
   gleeful comic romp and consequently Liman never takes the mishaps
   which befall the characters seriously -- there are shootings, ODs and
   other assorted misfortunes, and yet the film doesn't let up for a
   moment; it's as if the director feared the picture would stall the
   moment he took his foot off the pedal.  While there's nothing
   especially remarkable about August's topical, consciously hip
   dialogue, the situations in which the characters find themselves are
   often very witty and some of the cute little touches are inspired; the
   unlikely macerena and feline sage are standout moments.
   As good as Liman is in effectively injecting offbeat comedy into
   otherwise grim situations of youthful folly, his confident, kinetic
   visual work is his chief contribution to the picture.  The film's
   urgent pacing is assisted by Liman's bold, appealingly edgy
   cinematography; the handheld camerawork pops with energy that
   complements the rhythmic soundtrack, and Stephen Mirrione's crisp
   editing helps keep GO humming.
   While it's Liman's picture, the young ensemble cast is uniformly
   solid.  I don't think that her performance as resilient would-be drug
   dealer Ronna is vintage Sarah Polley, but it says a lot that she's
   nonetheless wholly arresting.  In his North American debut, Askew is
   great naughty fun, while Taye Diggs as level-headed friend Marcus is
   an unexpectedly strong screen presence.  Katie Holmes, playing Ronna's
   timid friend Claire, makes for an appealing collatoral, while William
   Fichtner makes a strong bid for leftover Christopher Walken roles with
   his memorable turn as the creepy Burke.
   For all of its propulsiveness, GO begins to run out of steam before
   reaching the finish line, but its primary deficiency is its sheer
   narrative unpredictablility; all of the twists and turns in the plot
   basically play out in random fashion.  While this certainly helps to
   keep the audience on its toes and involved to a certain degree, such
   arbitrariness also makes the proceedings feel a bit fleeting and
   shallow.  Although PULP FICTION, to which this picture owes its
   structural resemblence and shared general aesthetic, completely deals
   with redemptive themes, GO really doesn't have any running
   undercurrent -- it's cheerfully, blissfully amoral, and consequently
   lacks any real resonance.  Ultimately, GO is nothing more than a
   thrill ride, but it's a stylish, enjoyable one.

Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
I must admit, No Doubt's single "New" is quite catchy.   It was bouncy
and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director
Doug Limon, the man who had brought us the humorous Swingers a little
while back.  The result?  A movie that's just as good as that song,
really.
It follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one
weekend.  First we hear about a grocery bagger (Sara Polley) who runs
into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a
rave (with bad results, as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by
her); then comes the story of an English grocery store worker (same
store) who heads to Vegas for the weekend with friends, where sex,
gunplay, and stolen car trouble come into play; then we see the story of
two gay movie actors (played by Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr) who deal with a
cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl (Sara) with
their car; and, finally, we come to another grocery worker (Katie
Holmes) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer (the one
mentioned earlier).
Really, it's all confusing to keep track of in review format, your best
bet is to just, well, go.  The movie features some very good acting from
all angles, and Limon adds the same humorous energy he had with Swingers
to this particular product.  The dialogue is pretty snappy and the
resolution is pretty well realized, not going for the sappy happy ending
nor the dreaded bad ending.  Think of it as a, well, ending.
The intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie,
as it's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story,
like Sliding Doors kinda did.  However, it's better suited for the
younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks, which
Sliding Doors kinda isn't.

  Yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs
and sex.  Stars Katie Holmes and Sarah Polly couldn't look more bored.
Their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out
there.
  One thing you need to know is I really hated this movie.  Everything
about it annoyed the hell out of me.  The acting, and script, the
plot, and ending.  The director (of the fluke hit Swingers) could have
very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film.
The "big" stars of Go pretty much drown the project of any
originality.  I felt like I was watching Dawson's Creek Episode 200.
Although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast.
  The "surprise" ending was sooo predictable.  Since when is a male
character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in
Hollywood anymore??
  Go is Dawson's Creek + Varsity Blues - She's All That = Go home and
watch something else.

Since the surprise success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film, many films
have tried to become "the next _Pulp_Fiction_."  Films ranging from studio
efforts like the 1996 MGM release _2_days_in_the_Valley_ to the recent
British indie import _Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ have, in the
name of achieving commercial success and cinematic "cool," purloined at
least one characteristic of that modern-day classic: the seedy underworld
milieu, quirky canvases of characters played by large ensemble casts,
twisty plot threads linking these characters, "hip" dialogue heavy with pop
culture references, and--above all else--ultraviolence.  More often than
not, though, the films end up not so much cool but cold--as in dead (on
arrival).
With its large cast, crime world setting, and timeline-overlapping
storylines, _Go_, written by first-timer John August and directed by Doug
Liman (who created a different brand of cinematic "cool" with 1996's
_Swingers_), could not tempt failure more dangerously.  Yet of all the
_Pulp_ knockoffs I've seen, this is the first that truly understands and
captures what made that film such a triumph.  It wasn't the casting (though
that definitely helped); it certainly wasn't the violence; nor was it the
snappy dialogue of Tarantino and Roger Avary's Oscar-winning script--at
least not that aspect of the screenplay, anyway.
The elusive quality in question is the element of realistic surprise.
_Go_ spans one eventful 24-hour span, during which the life paths of Ronna
(Sarah Polley), a teenage supermarket clerk who tries her hand at drug
dealing; Ronna's British co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew); and friends Adam
and Zack (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) constantly crisscross through Los
Angeles and Las Vegas.  While following these three threads, August and
Liman find unpredictable yet completely plausible ways to link the stories
and take them in their own wild, roller coaster-like directions--without
ever falling into the cheap trap of gratuitous violence.  To say anymore
would be to rob the viewer of this film's greatest delight: that of discovery.
Not too far behind is the August's sharp sense of humor (suffice it to
say, his hilarious dialogue and original comic situations do have snap) and
the sterling ensemble.  Everyone does a standout job, but especially
noteworthy are Polley, so good in Atom Egoyan's _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, who
takes a surefooted step toward the mainstream; Askew, a newcomer to this
side of the Atlantic; creepy William Fichtner, playing a cop with a hidden
agenda; and Katie Holmes and Taye Diggs shine in more secondary roles.  Not
to be ignored, though, are the efforts of Liman.  He shows a disarming
visual flair never hinted at in _Swingers_ (which was more of a
script-dependent movie than a director-dependent one), and it is his
guiding voice that assembles the numerous parts into a finely calibrated
thrill machine.
Because of its largely youthful cast, _Go_ is in danger of--and, in fact,
already has, to some extent--being pigeonholed as a "teen _Pulp_Fiction_,"
and given the films' similarities, that title is not entirely undeserved.
But _Go_ deserves a more favorable comparison.  While not in the same
league as its precursor, what August and Liman have done is use _Pulp_
basics to create a film that is, by its own merits, a fiercely original and
exhilarating entertainment.

Documenting the wild and unbelievable events  that happen to a
collection of twentysomethings and teens in Los Angeles, the exuberant
movie, Go, is a film that doesn't feel original, yet sure is fun to
watch.
The film intertwines three stories over one fateful Christmas Eve. The
first revolves around grocery store clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley).  She  is
about to be evicted from her apartment, unless she can come up with  the
necessary money in the next 24 hours.  Hope comes in the form of two
bickering actors (Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr), who are looking to score
some ecstasy for an all-night rave.  Ronna decides to do this one time
drug deal for some quick cash...but quickly gets in over her head.
The second storyline follows four thrillseekers (including Desmond
Askew, Taye Diggs, and Breckin Meyer) on a Christmas trip to Vegas.  The
twenty-four hours that follow seem to spring from both their wildest
fantasies and nightmares.
The final story brings back elements of the first two, as the
aforementioned actors, Adam and Zack have their own set of
misadventures.  Primarily, they center around the duo's run-in with a
mysteriously eccentric character, Burke (William Fichtner). But the
story launches from there to tie in elements of the other two plotlines
as well.
It's impossible to watch Go without thinking about Pulp Fiction, but at
least in this instance, the comparison is favorable.  Both films tell an
anthology of stories, with titles preceding each one, and a non-linear
chronological structure.  But whereas Pulp Fiction was about criminals
who were shockingly acting like normal people, Go is rather about normal
people who are shockingly acting like criminals.
One thing that sets Go apart from the pack is the acting.  From the
leads, down to the supporting members, each actor has been flawlessly
cast.  However, Sarah Polley certainly stands above the crowd. From The
Sweet Hereafter to her performance here, she is proving herself one of
the most talented actresses of her generation.  Another great
performance comes from William Fichtner (another Pulp Fiction nod), who
gives the film a fine, creepy supporting performance.
The plot of Go is well written, and is able to stand on its own, even
without the borrowed structural gimmick.  The dialogue is sharp and
lively, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep everyone on
their toes.
The intelligence of the script, the director and the actors allows Go to
rise above the level of a simple copycat picture.  Funny, shocking and
overall entertaining, Go delivers.

When I sat down to watch Go, I must admit that I was expecting yet another
in a long line of teen-oriented movies which have been popping up recently.
That is to say long on style and very short on substance. At first it seemed
as though that was what I was in store for. The movie started out a little
on the slow side (read lame). The director seemed more interested in showing
off music video style camera work than actually trying to tell a story.
Happily, the movie steadily improved to the point where it ended up being a
very good film. Due in no small part to its excellent young cast (some of
whom, I had never heard of before).
Go is basically three intersecting stories. They all start at more or less
the same point and then later converge in much the same point. All work very
well on their own and the fact that they all combine in the end is simply
icing on a very pleasant cake. There are no predominant stars in Go. All of
the cast have pretty decent sized roles. If I had to focus in on a few as
the main leads Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr come to
mind. Polley and Holmes play supermarket check out girls who are approached
by soap-opera starts Wolf and Mohr who are looking to score a few drugs for
a party that they are having. Polley and Holmes then try to procure the
drugs for the two actors but things don't go exactly as planned. This is a
gross simplification of the plot of the movie but to explain it in any
greater detail would risk spoiling it. It would also take a couple of
paragraphs.
Acting wise, Go is almost without fault. With the exception of one minor
character who got on my nerves a bit, the cast is amazing. Many will be
familiar with Scott Wolf from TV's Party Of Five. Anyone that has watched
TV's Dawson's Creek is no doubt familiar with the talent of Katie Holmes,
who ranks very high in my book as one of Hollywood's most talented young
stars. To hear US film critics talk, Sarah Polley has just magically
appeared out of nowhere. Canadians have been aware of Ms. Polley's
considerable talent for quite some time, so it comes as no shock to anyone
that she gives a standout performance in this her first major American film.
I'm guessing that those same critics forgot her performance in the Academy
Award-nominated The sweet Hereafter in 1997.
My only complaint was with some of the bad camera work in the early part of
the movie. To be honest, I don't think it really improved all that much as
the movie went on, but the story was so compelling that the poor direction
wasn't such a major issue. It's sad that Hollywood seems to thin that the
only way to keep a young audience's attention is to direct a film like a
music video. Herky jerky camera moves works well in a 3 minute music video,
but it gets real old real fast in a feature length movie.
Go is cleverly written and frequently funny, although some of the scenes do
miss the mark. I would say that Go is certainly the smartest movie that I
have seen in 1999. It will probably rank among the best of the teen-type
films released this year. If nothing else, it gives stars Sarah Polley,
Katie Holmes, Scott Wolf and the rest of the very talented cast a showcase
for their ample acting abilities.
8/10 -- Clever story and cast, only detracted from by the director's MTV
style camera work

Like "Hillary and Jackie", "Lovers of the Arctic Circle" and even "Pulp
Fiction"; "GO" tells the same story from more than one perspective -- three
in fact. Each perspective is carefully titled (ie: screen goes black, name
of character whose point of view is to be portrayed appears in white). I
find this a bit patronizing, I'd rather the filmmakers just thrust us into
the next perspective and let us figure it out. I'd appreciate that momentary
confusion.
"GO" depicts the fumbling side of the underworld, with believable foul-ups
that include graphic un-glorified violence and stumblingly fun dialogue.
This being the genre of "Pulp Fiction," and more recently, "Lock Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels."
In the "GO" story a young teen grocery cashier short on cash plays drug
dealer for the night. She and her friends get in way over their heads.
Perspective one: Ronna (Sarah Polley) decides to act as replacement for her
drug-dealing friend Simon who has taken off to Las Vegas for the Weekend. I
did not like this soulless character. I did not Polley's acting. I did not
like this third of the movie, Sam I am.
Perspective two: Simon (Desmond Askew) weasels his buddy Marcus (Taye Diggs)
into a violent predicament with two Las Vegas thugs. The interplay between
the two is quite entertaining. One of the best clips of dialogue plays in
the preview. Marcus cuts off Simon's black-blooded boasting with, "If you
were any more white you'd be clear!"
Perspective three: Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr) are con men
recruited by an oddball detective to entrap Simon (or in this case --
Ronna).
Though I nearly walked out of this film during the first telling of the
story -- the second and third perspectives were extremely entertaining and
very cleverly intertwined.
Starring Desmond Askew, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, J.E. Freeman, Katie
Holmes, Jane Krakowski, Breckin Meyer, Jay Mohr, Timothy Olyphant, Sarah
Polley and Scott Wolf. Directed by Doug Liman. Written by John August.

     Believe it or not, this is a Christmas movie!  And here it is, the
middle of April, and there's nothing else I'd rather see.
     Let me put it this way: GO is the best movie I've seen since
FARGO.  Doug Liman, the man behind the brilliant SWINGERS (which, I
realized, came out much too long ago, in 1996), has concocted such a
film that I'm almost compelled to pay the whopping $8.50 to see it
again.
     GO is a seamier look at life than SWINGERS, brilliantly
deconstructing Gen X life in latter-day Los Angeles, giving a new
perspective on rave culture, drug dealers, the lure of Vegas, and even
Amway distributorship.  Through the lead characters of Ronna (Polley),
Claire (Holmes), and Simon (Askew), you'll never look at grocery store
clerks the same way.
     GO owes its clever structure to PULP FICTION, following multiple
interlocking storylines and bouncing back and forth chronologically.  To
attempt to distill the plotlines here is to do the film an injustice,
but it centers around Ronna's attempt to get $380 to pay the rent, which
leads her to try to sell 20 hits of Ecstasy in a drug deal gone awry. 
Really awry.  Completely unpredictable.  Hilarious.  All of it unified
through the phrase, "Go!"
     I can't say enough good things about GO, and I urge you to see it. 
The acting, directing, and especially August's writing are all far
better than we're all used to.  You may not even know how to react.
     That's why GO gets filmcritic.com's coveted and rarely awarded:
Director: Doug Liman
Producer: Matt Freeman, Mickey Liddell, Paul Rosenberg

 Go (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Sarah Polley, Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf,
Desmond Askew and Taye Diggs
 "Go" is an energetic exercise in frantic filmmaking that also is witty,
stylish and enjoyable.
 The movie, directed by Doug Liman of "Swingers'" fame, tells three
interconnecting stories set on Christmas Eve and all concerning young
people involved in Los Angeles' raucous and seamy underground life.
 The initial story revolves around Ronna (Sarah Polley), an 18-year-old
grocery store checkout clerk who needs to raise some money to keep from
being evicted from her apartment.
 She hits upon a scheme to fill in for Simon (Desmond Askew), one of her
co-workers, who deals drugs as a sideline.
 Simon, it seems, is taking off with some friends for a weekend jaunt in
Las Vegas.
 Ronna scores some pills, which she is supposed to sell to Adam (Scott
Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr), a pair of TV stars, who, coincidentally, find
themselves starring in a real-life drug sting.
 All those stories and most of the characters intersect in John August's
fast-paced script.
 Liman, who also handled the cinematography, creates an edgy atmosphere as
he continually jumps his camera around. You never know what's going to
happen next, nor who will pop into the picture.
 Of the three stories, the best - and funniest - is the vignette set in
Vegas where Simon and his buddies, including Marcus (Taye Diggs), are set
for a weekend of frolic.
 Of course things go terribly wrong as Simon is involved in a fire, a
shooting and a car theft. The Vegas stay is cut short as the buddies make a
hasty retreat back to Los Angeles.
 Though "Go" is an ensemble piece, a couple of the performers do stand out,
especially Diggs as the ever-cool Marcus and Polley as the beleaguered
Ronna.
 This is a movie geared more for the 20-something audience. Older audiences
may not appreciate the casual approach to drugs and sex. If so, that's
their loss, since "Go" is rife with humor.
 Wolf and Mohr are winning as the actors dealing with a moral dilemma,
while Askew is a bit outrageous as the impulsive Briton who, as he tells
his buddies, learned to drive by watching American cop shows.
 Liman, following in the footsteps of Quentin Tarantino, deftly mixes
comedy and violence, overdoing neither.
 And while "Go" is no "Pulp Fiction," it has a similar in-your-face air,
daring you to accept the movie on its own terms or forget it.
 "Go" is an entertaining ride, a wild, kinetic experience that is most
satisfying.

I have become sickened by all the Tarantino rip-offs, too many to
mention.  Almost all have none of the grace, wit or humanity that dear
Quentin invests in his own works. They are like well-designed
wallpapers flung with graphic violence, countless obscenities, and
numerous rock n' roll/rap songs and packaged as something shocking and
new. Some star Michael Madsen, Martin Sheen or Dennis Hopper. "Out of
Sight" was the most dazzling but that had the advantage of a great
author, Elmore Leonard, as its basis, and Steven Soderbergh, a stylish
director. The new "Go" is different - it's as symmetrically close to
"Pulp Fiction" as you can imagine but it has an electric energy and
volume all its own.
The film begins with a supermarket checkout girl named Ronna
(soft-voiced and droopy-eyed Sarah Polley from "Sweet Hereafter") who
establishes a drug connection for two handsome soap opera stars, Adam
(Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr). Ronna's drug of choice is ecstasy,
which one member of her elite group nearly overdoses on and imagines
speaking to a cat with Zen subtitles. Ronna has to deal with the seedy
drug dealer, Todd (Timothy Olyphant), who has a propensity for sexual
favors. But when her good friend, Claire (Katie Holmes), another
supermarket checkout girl, is left alone with this devil, things truly
go haywire.
After Ronna's predicament, we flash back to the beginning of
the story told from the point-of-view of a thick-accented, red-haired
Brit, Simon (Desmond Askew). Simon is a drug connection for Todd
(Ronna is the replacement) and goes off to Vegas with his pals,
including the suave Marcus (Taye Diggs) and a stoner who thinks he's
black, Tiny (Breckin Meyer - always the pothead).  Unfortunately,
after a debacle involving backroom lap-dancers ("Do not touch!"), they
are now on the run from a vicious gangster (the terrifically oily
J.E. Freeman). And it is here where we experience one of the most
dazzling car chases ever filmed to the tune of Steppenwolf's "Magic
Carpet Ride."
Then the story flashes back again and we see the story told
from the point-of-view of the two soap opera stars, who are working
undercover under the tutelage of the Teutonic cop Burke (William
Fichtner), a character that makes you squirm. Burke invites the pair
to a Christmas dinner that is fraught with misunderstandings and
unclear intentions. Let's just say it is a howler of a sequence,
guaranteed to keep you laughing at its inevitable payoff.
The characters, as well as the audience, experience one
near-catastrophe after another, and all the characters seem intent to
make a whole 24-hour, Rashomon-like experience as dangerously exciting
as possible with no inhibitions - they will do absolutely anything for
thrills. There are gangsters, awry drug deals, dances to the tune of
"Macarena," distorted visions, extreme violence, conversations about
Tantric sex and the comic "The Family Circus," and lots more to feast
the eyes and the ears.
"Go" is suffused with electric energy throughout - there is
not a moment that is not thrilling or kinetic in any way. Director
Doug Liman ("Swingers") frames his charismatic actors with tension
abounding every step of the way by means of a constantly roving
camera. The opening titles show a stroboscopic club where silhouetted
patrons dance the night away in light blue hues, and the editing is
lightning-paced. This brilliantly sets up the rest of the film's pace,
and sometimes Liman will slow down long enough to study the actor's
faces.
I enjoyed all the actors on screen, but Sarah Polley has a
dole-like quality that is more realistic than the cardboard teens
shown in other films - I could not stop looking at her. Katie Holmes
displays a sensuousness and a charm that made me swoon. I also liked
the merry soul of Taye Diggs, a definite star-in-the-making.
"Go" may remind many of "Pulp Fiction," but this film has its
own momentum, and plenty of style to spare. It's a crazy film that
will keep you on edge - funny, energetic, joyous, jolting, ironic, and
tense. You can't ask for a better time at the movies.

GO (director: Doug Liman; cast: Desmond Askew (Simon Baines), Taye Diggs
(Marcus), William Fichtner (Burke), J.E. Freeman (Victor Sr.), Katie
Holmes (Claire Montgomery), Jay Mohr (Zack), Timothy Olyphant (Todd
Gaines), Sarah Polley (Ronna Martin), Scott Wolf (Adam), Breckin Meyer
(Tiny), 1999)
A zippy youth oriented Christmas movie (though there is no Bing singing
White Christmas in this one) marketed for the druggie generation of
post-teens and those in their late 20s, that is perhaps a cut above the
rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's
largest share of ticket buyers, as it tells its somewhat derivative
black comic tale, (PULP FICTION type dialogue and style), fuelled by the
originality of its accelerated pace, using the cool life-style in LALA
land as its backdrop, and telling about its main characters who either
work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing
pills.
GO is made up of three interconnected stories, which are told in
different versions from the point where Ronna (Polley ), as the
supermarket cashier strapped for rent money, about to be evicted on
Christmas Eve, is on the phone, as her fellow supermarket cashier, the
Britisher, Simon (Desmond), who needs to go to Las Vegas with his mates,
makes Ronna an offer, giving her his pay up front, if she takes his
shift at work.
The first story is about Ronna, who shows some spunk, interacting with
her fellow workers by playing a funny kind of guess the celebrity game
while on a break, but is quickly dislodged into reality when the manager
tells her the break is over, and she is back at work filling in for
Simon, after finishing her 14- hour shift. In this frenetically paced
film, the innovative young director, Doug Liman, following his indie
debut feature, SWINGERS, shows that he has a feel for these young people
and their problematic world, as he grapples with their realities, giving
us a good look at how they view themselves, their job and their
customers. On Ronna's check out line are two good-looking guys,
appearing to be swish, to the dismay of one of Ronna's cashier
girlfriends, Claire (Katie), as these two, Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack
(Jay Mohr), ask for Simon, and quickly let on that he is their drug
supplier, while telling Ronna they will deal with her because they need
the stuff, immediately, for a party. This gives Ronna some ideas that
she can do the deal herself  by going to Simon's supplier, Todd
(Olyphant); but, he tells her she needs all the money up front to make
the deal. From there on, what can go wrong for her, does. The most
amusing bit, is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as
substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill, at a party, where those
who are there, are so high already, they don't know the difference from
one pill to the other.
The second story is one that I must have seen a dozen times by now in
films, about the guys who go to Vegas, gamble over their head, get into
trouble, have a car chase, meet some gangsters and Vegas showgirls, and
have themselves a vacation they can't forget. What saves this story is
not the story, but the charm of the hapless Simon in Vegas, and the mood
set by the glitzy Vegas world of neon, that blends violence in with the
loud background music, as the bouncers chase after Simon and his
friends, all because Simon put his hands on a lap dancer and wounded the
bouncer who was pummeling him. But it is the very likable nature of
Simon's amusing friends, as they chatter away, one conversation has the
white Tiny (Breckin) telling the black Marcus (Taye), that race is a
state of mind, other conversations include one about Tantric sex, that
saves the day in Vegas.
The third and final story traces Adam and Zack, the two TV actors and
lovers, who got busted and are now wired to catch other drug offenders,
such as Simon and Ronna, with the promise by the weird undercover
officer in charge of them (Fichtner), that if they cooperate, they will
be let completely off the hook. I though Fichtner was the funniest and
most malevolent one in the film.
I don't think the film had much to say about much of anything, including
the use of drugs, but it hit hard at being an hilarious film, with its
fast-paced mood swings, its sharp editing cuts and frequent light
changes, allowing its story to be easy to watch, and imbuing the
characters with a certain attitude about them, that made their
performances seem eclectic. I especially liked Sarah Polley, when she
wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose.
In any case, GO has watch ability because of its raw energy, and the way
it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen
how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high. Yet the film for all
its innovative features, still could not escape, from being on the edge
of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking. And the only
reason for calling it a Christmas story, is because it happens during
the holiday season, probably accurately showing how some generation
x'ers now spend their holidays. The film's appeal is still mostly with
the younger generation. They are the ones who are mostly likely to be
amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves, while
the older generations might not be as amused, and feel put off by the
lack of any character depth or real wit in the story. And the benign
ending, not only didn't make sense, but seemed artificial and
embarrassing to watch. It was as if this film after using all its energy
in rebellion, now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending.

Filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a
dull, dreary, and overused idea. Doug Liman (SWINGERS), director of the
ultra-hip and severely dark comedy GO, is an example of just such a
filmmaker. In his latest, he gives the viewers a raucous, neon-lit
backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested
path of misadventure as director. But he fails to come up with any
parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect
with the audience on any level, bringing the worth of his efforts to nil
and the value of GO to about the same. 
His movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from
multiple (three) points of view, much as an author might write a serial
novel. Consistent with this ethic, Liman and screenwriter John August
provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and
insert brief connections to other narratives. The thread that laces the
three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter. In
story A we have checkout clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) looking to score
some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it; in story B we
have regular drug dealer Simon (Desmond Askew) gone to Las Vegas giving
Ronna her opportunity; and in story C we have gay soap actors Zack (Jay
Mohr) and Adam (Scott Wolf) working undercover for the police to bust
said drug deal. 
Neither of the three stories have much substance, and the movie has the
feel of a campfire story (albeit a rather strange one) that could be
told in five to ten minutes. (In fact, the movie was originally a short
film entitled X expanded to feature length.) The early April release
date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's Christmas setting, and
the Los Angeles/Las Vegas nightlife is something too far from the
mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to. The
characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite, and performances
from little-known players like Polley, Askew, and Taye Diggs don't help
or hurt the roles. In fact, even bigger names like Mohr, Wolf, and Katie
Holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success. 
Although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time, the
success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories.
GO doesn't have this, and it suffers because of it. As far as teen
movies are concerned, GO represents the absolute bottom, for its
constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without
some sort of common theme. (The following do not count as common themes:
drug deals, people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug
dealers, people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives, or people
not involved in drug deals stumbling into them.) At times, the humor in
GO is sickly funny, and on a low night, almost watchable; but for the
majority of its running time and for most viewers, this movie will best
be left to teens at Blockbuster on a Saturday night.

Yes, another film in the Pulp Fiction genre.  
Is _Go_ good?  Depends.  If you loved _Pulp Fiction, then perhaps you'd like
_Go_.  Or come out disappointed.  Or wonder how many plot twists from the
latter were lifted from the former.
_Go_ details the events that occurred before and after a disastrous drug
deal.  The word "go" is, to my knowledge, uttered three times, at three
significant points, meaning three different things.  These three stories are
told, within the same twenty-four hour time frame.  
Because the stories are incredibly loony, with coincidences abounding, the
film falls into the terrible trap of coming up with as many vices that could
be conjured up within the small time frame.  More than once, you hear one
character say "Don't do this..." only to have it done later.  For these
moments, the film is predictable.
But to its credit, many of the plot twists are totally unprecedented.  Kudos
goes to William Fichtner, (great in _Contact_, terrible in _Armageddon_).
His role is so well executed that when the punch line comes, it's from a
totally unexpected track, that is both maddening and hysterical.
The same goes for the rest of the cast:  not a stinker in the bunch.  Katie
Holmes and Sarah Polley show true star potential, far different from their
previous work.  Jason Flemyng has come a long way from _Scream 2_, as the
heinous drug-dealer, who is as concerned with getting his fare share as how
bad "Family Circus" is.
But because of its setup, you can't help but recognize how totally
artificial the exercise is.  Hear me out.  Sarah Polley's character is being
kicked out of her apartment.  Christmas Day.  And she works three shifts in
a row to help make ends meet.  Excuse me?  And that's before the story kicks
in.  Suffice it to say, you can only wonder what got into the heads of Doug
Limon (director) and John August (screenwriter) who have her go through much
more, only to return to work the next day.
And what to make of the total role-reversal that Holmes' character goes
through?  She is kept at Flemyng's grungy apartment as bait, until Polley
gets back.  She is terrified of him.  Later, she makes a series of decisions
that contradict everything we had seen before.  
_Go_ doesn't exist to fully make sense.  It exists as a throwaway vehicle
for its stars, all of which have a good future before them.  It (thankfully)
doesn't take itself seriously (the scene where the Macarena is playing is a
prime example).  So it's fun, and it's incredibly busy, even though the film
in general doesn't follow the rules of ordinary logic.

GO (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Doug Liman
Stars: Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Desmond Askew, Taye 
Diggs, Breckin Meyer, James Duval, Scott Wolf, Jay Mohr, William Fichtner,
J E Freeman, Nathan Bexton, Jay Paulson, Jimmy Shubert, Jane Krakowski
Running time: 102 minutes.
Doug Liman's follow up to Swingers is a much more entertaining
and accomplished film, and one of the cinematic surprises of this year
so far.  The film also features a hot and hip ensemble young cast,
drawn primarily from the world of television soaps (Katie Holmes from
Dawson's Creek and Scott Wolf from Party Of Five), and a number of
rising actors on the cusp of stardom.
Go deals with a drug bust gone wrong, and the narrative thread
follows the various characters through an incredibly hectic 24 hour
period.
Ronna (Sarah Polley, from The Sweet Hereafter, etc), a check
out clerkk in a Los Angeles supermarket, is about to be evicted from
her apartment because she is behind in her rent.  She agrees to take a
double shift, thus allowing her colleague Simon (beautifully played by
British actor Desmond Askew) to go to Vegas with three friends.  Ronna
is approached by Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr, from Jerry
Maguire, etc), the stars of a popular tv soap opera, who are looking
for some drugs to liven up a party later that evening.  Ronna
reluctantly agrees, hoping to score some extra money on the side.
She buys the drugs from Simon's contact Todd (Timothy
Olyphant, from Scream 2, etc), "the nice drug dealer".  But when she
approaches the two actors, she finds out the whole thing is a set-up.
Go explores the aftermath of this drug deal.  The film then
switches to follows Simon's misadventures in Vegas.  While two of his
friends come down with food poisoning, Simon and Marcus (Taye Diggs,
from How Stella Got Her Groove Back) visit a strip joint and run afoul
of the management.  They are pursued back to LA by the club's owner (J
E Freeman), with murder on his mind.
Meanwhile, we learn more about the relationship between Zack
and Adam, and how they came to be blackmailed into co-operating with a
sleazy cop (William Fichtner, from Armageddon, etc) for the drug
operation.
First time writer John August has obviously been inspired by
Tarantino and, in particular, Pulp Fiction, and Go wears its
influences openly and proudly.  In his sophomore film Liman handles
the various narrative strands with assurance, and brings the whole
thing full circle to a satisfying finish.
Liman directs the complex structure with energy and style, and
shows that he is quite adept at staging some inventive action
sequences.  The use of hand held cameras, especially during the
exciting car chase through the streets of Las Vegas, adds to the
movie's breakneck pace.  The film is also suffused with generous
dollops of wry black humour, and a marvellous soundtrack that seems to
propel the action along.

     Go is fun.  Go is the kind of fun that makes you want a cigarette
afterwards and, a bad mark on it, leaves some of us wanting more.
 The plot of Go is reminiscient of a country song I once heard: "Why Don't
We Get Drunk and Screw?" except that in Go, the refrain should be: "Why
Don't We Hit Pot and Screw?".  A classic demonstration of sex, drugs, and
rock 'n roll, Go takes us on a non-linear, multi-faceted view of a drug
deal.
     We watch the SNAFU go down from three viewpoints, taking us back and
forth through time and space and ending up where we began.  If it sounds
like Pulp Fiction, you shouldn't be surprised.  In basic story structure,
the two films are near carbon copies.  In Pulp Fiction, it tells the story
of two hits gone wrong with diversions in between, and in Go we see the
story of a drug deal gone wrong, with diversions in between.  There is,
however, a notable difference.  Pulp Fiction was a serious movie with some
comedic elements.  Go is a comedic movie with some serious elements.  That
is why I told people expecting something serious to get lost.
     To go into detail about the plot, we have Ronna (Sarah Polley from The
Sweet Hereafter and Exotica), a girl behind on her rent who decides to deal
drugs and work extra shifts in order to avoid being evicted.  She gets set
up to deal drugs by two gay soap actors working for cops, Zach (Jay Morh)
and Adam (Scott Wolf) and is aided in the act by her friends Claire (Katie
Holmes) and Mannie (Nathan Bexton) and the LA drug dealer Todd Gaines
(Timothy Olyphant).  When the deal goes wrong, Ronna is forced to flush the
real Ecstasy and ends up dealing Baby Asprin at a Christmas Rave.
     Meanwhile, in Vegas, the normal drug dealer, Simon (Desmond Askew) is
having a ball in Vegas.  He loses money, has a threesome where he attains a
new spiritual high, sets a room on fire because one of the girls set tissues
on fire as she plugged her nose in order to take a bong hit.  Running from
that, he teams up with Marcus (Taye Diggs), a black guy who keeps being
mistaken for a hotel worker due to his race.  Marcus, as a revenge of sorts,
steals a ferarri which happens to have a 9mm in it and the two of them go to
a strip club, where Simon steals a bouncer.  The bouncer, of course, has a
psychotic father (J.E. Freeman) who begins to chase them through Vegas and
L.A.
     The film is a technical masterpiece but a sad spot of storytelling.
Incredibly strong in the realm of dark comedy, it then tries to suddenly be
serious and ends up annoying people like me.  Look, if you're going to have
a point than have a point, and if you're not, don't try.
     Aside from that it is an incredibly cool movie.  People obsessed with
the movies will be awestruck at Liman's capability to capture the rave so
completely, which he does by using some of the best lighting effects
captured on the silver screen (furthermore, it does not lack the idiotic
error of seeing the Stedicam's shadow that we saw in Swingers).  People
obsessed with music will love the soundtrack, which includes No Doubt and
Natalie Imbruglia (the No Doubt song, at the risk of sounding like a stupid
member of my MTV generation, kicks ass).  People who are obsessed with drugs
will just love the drugs.
     The film is gifted with scenes funnier than you are normally greeted
with in a drug movie.  In Cheech and Chong, we just saw them act stoned.  In
Go, we see them being high.  Two strange drug sequences occur as an Ecstasy
double-dosed junkie imagines tangoing with a fellow check out lady and is
later talked to about Chinest nationalists by a cat.  Another beautiful
moment comes when a bunch of yuppie teens trick each other into believing
that sinus medicine is Ecstasy in the midst of a Ford Windstar.
     Not a film for anyone who minds drugs, sex, profanity, and the general
yada yada yada that I don't care about, it still comes off as an extreme
dose of fun for twentysomethings and below.  Just know this coming in to Go.
Don't smoke pot during this film: you get all the same effects by just
watching it.

The next time you find yourself coming up short on rent day, try this:
Get a few bottles of allergy medicine, head out to the local rave
party and sell the tablets for $20 apiece. Chances are the kids you're
selling it to will already be high and won't notice that the pills
aren't doing anything except opening up their sinuses.
That's Ronna's (Sarah Polley) strategy for avoiding eviction, and it's
typical of the kookiness of "Go," the second feature from director
Doug Liman. Like Liman's first movie, "Swingers," "Go" is propelled by
its quirks and details rather than drama; unlike the generally mellow
"Swingers," however, "Go" zooms through its shaggy dog story with the
same adrenalin rush that dominates its psychedelic soundtrack from
master DJ BT.
If "Go" is reminiscent of Robert Altman's film "Short Cuts" (in which
a couple of dozen Californians of differing social classes turn out to
share common threads), it's considerably lighter in tone.  How grim
can things get when the closest thing the movie has to a villian is a
guy who wears a Santa hat, quotes from "The Breakfast Club" and
deconstructs "The Family Circus"?
This sort of project lives or dies by its casting, and Liman has done
an outstanding job. Polley ("The Sweet Hereafter") and Katie Holmes
("Dawson's Creek") are endearingly earthy as Ronna and Claire, two
seemingly bright young women condemned to waste their days working
endless shifts at the check-out counter of a fourth-rate grocery
store. To add insult to injury, in honor of the Christmas holidays,
the cashiers are forced to wear "Yule Save More" buttons on their
Velveeta-colored aprons.
But Ronna's life becomes a bit livelier when TV stars Adam and Zack
(comedian Jay Mohr and "Party of Five's" Scott Wolf, playing amusingly
against type) come through her line. They're looking to score some
designer drugs before heading to a holiday rave, and, since their
usual dealer Simon (Desmond Askew) is out of town, they turn to Ronna
for help. She, in turn, hightails it to Todd (Timothy Olyphant), the
local drug kingpin, a decision that leads to a traumatic night for all
concerned.
Besides its characters, what elevates "Go" high above the typical
"party picture" - such as"Can't Hardly Wait," for example - is
screenwriter John August's zingy dialogue. As when a guy refuses to
reveal everything about his indiscretions, warning his lover that if
he does, "you will freak out and it will be drama, bad, not-funny
'Roseanne' kind of drama." As when would-be Vegas smoothies Tiny
(Breckin Meyer) and Marcus (Taye Diggs) debate about race and Tiny
insists it's all "a state of mind," Marcus responds by calling him
"Rhythm Nation."
For a fledgling director, getting funding from a major studio on your
second film often means having to compromise the qualities that
originally set you apart from the crowd. The buoyant, sassy and
decidedly unglossy "Go" is proof Liman has managed to avoid that trap.

Diggs. Rated R.
What's a critic to do when he sees a movie he wholeheartedly enjoys but winds
up asking why it was made? What if a film's purpose and the motivation behind
it remains a mystery? What does one make of an interesting, entertaining
movie that is almost utterly pointless? Watching Go, the new flick from Doug
Liman, director of the sleeper hit Swingers put me in that very dilemma.
Go is an intriguingly structured movie in that it replays the period of time
following a drug deal 3 times: each time from the perspective of a different
character (or set of characters). First we are shown Ronna, a 17-year old
girl who works at a supermarket and is about to be evicted on Christmas Day
because she is short on her rent. When her drug trafficker friend Simon
leaves for the weekend, she jumps at the chance of making some extra bucks by
running a drug deal herself, until she finds out that her two customers are
working for the police and are about to bust her. She is forced to halt
mid-stream and dump her merchandise without getting any money, putting her in
trouble with the drug dealer whom she still owes, and whom she left a friend
of hers with as collateral. The movie then follows her as she tries to get
out of the situation, attend a rave and pay her rent all at the same time.
Then, after a rather unpredictable turn of events the screen fades to black
and we are taken all the way bact to the beginning, but this time the film
follows Simon as he goes to Las Vegas with his friends where he gets in
trouble with a nasty strip club bouncer and struggles to escape. Finally, as
we are taken back to the beginning again, we see the story from the point of
view of the two gay actors/criminals who are Ronna's "customers" working with
the cops trying to catch her in the act of committing a crime.
Go is a daring, fast-paced movie that entertains down to the bone. The
multitude of interesting characters also helps to keep the audience's
attention, and few people will be bored. The movie's script, written by John
August is full of quirky wit that will strike a chord with the film's younger
audience as well as fans of Doug Liman's slightly more upbeat Swingers.
I also liked the way Liman brought all of the characters together in the end,
revealing that they were all involved in the events that transpired after the
drug deal that went terribly wrong. But even with this neat loose-end tier,
Go suffers from lack of a common theme to tie these three stories together.
Sure, the lusty, steamy, violent and rather thrilling action is wickedly
entertaining but there's nothing to organize it and bring it all together
under the surface.
Many comparisons will be made between Go and some of Quentin Tarantino's
work, and rightfully so; some of his films have many structural similarities
with Liman's movie. The kicker, however, is that while Tarantino's dialogue
is rarely purely for dialogue's sake: there are always slight hints as to the
movie's main theme. The dialogue in Go, while funny and original, is purely
superficial.
Go is best viewed as an exceptionally good teen movie; where the viewer is
happy that it is good but restricts himself from yearning for more from Doug
Liman. More ambitious moviegoers may be dissappointed with this derivative
frivolous exercise. But like I said before: No one will be bored.

I caught Go on the rebound.  My chosen movie for the evening was Lee Marvin
leading The Dirty Dozen, playing at Austin's Paramount Theater
(www.theparamount.org) as part of their summer classic movie series.
Unfortunately, when the MGM lion appeared at the start of the movie, he
didn't roar.  The Paramount's sound system was missing in action.  After a
couple of false starts, the theater manager announced that they couldn't
get the sound rolling, and that re-admit passes would be waiting at the box
office.  (Note to film preservationists:  According to the Paramount
people, this is the only 35mm reel of The Dirty Dozen in existence, and
what I saw of it looked badly faded.)
I had two dollars in my pocket -- drinks and popcorn at the Paramount are
reasonably priced, thank goodness -- which meant that the only available
cure for cinema interruptis was a trip to the dollar movie, where Go looked
like the best of a mixed bag. In one of the opening scenes, three
supermarket clerks are sitting in the back of the store, playing a "Dead
Celebrities" word game, and one throws out the name, "Lee Marvin".  I was
in the right place.
Go's cinematic origins, though, have less to do with Lee Marvin and more to
do with Quentin Tarantino.  Go actually starts in a small cafe with a young
man and a young woman chatting about nothing, a conversation that is
recapitulated in the last third of the movie.  Pulp Fiction fans will
recognize this homage, and will feel right at home with Go's interlocking
tripartite narrative.  Go takes place in the same seedy underbelly of Los
Angeles that houses the Tarantino universe, but its characters are younger,
hipper, and less cynical.  Nobody in Go eats Big Kahuna Burgers or hangs
out at Jackrabbit Slim's or reads Modesty Blaise on the can.  They're too
busy dancing at rave parties and worrying about how to pay the rent.
Unlike the businesslike hitmen in Pulp Fiction, the characters in Go are
likable and spunky:  there aren't any bad guys in this movie to speak of.
To reveal much of the twisty plot of Go would be to spoil it entirely.  As
the movie's theme song suggests, Go is a Magic Carpet Ride, whizzing up,
down, and all around, back and forth through time and space, with all the
plot points intricately woven together in a tight-knit pattern. The
narrative skips from a dumpy Los Angeles supermarket (one almost expects
The Dude from The Big Lebowski to shuffle by in his bathrobe) to the Strip
in Las Vegas to a Christmas Eve rave party in an abandoned warehouse.
Oddball characters abound, from a pair of blissed-out Vegas bridesmaids to
a supermarket checker who gets stoned to the point where he can hear cats
talk, to a police couple with... shall we say... outside interests.
Since I can't talk about the plot much -- other to say that it's a hoot --
I'll concentrate on the first-rate job by the ensemble cast.  The two most
familiar faces belong to Jay Mohr and William Fichtner.  You will remember
Mohr as the rival super-agent Burt Sugar from the sainted Jerry Maguire,
where he spent the movie stealing scenes and clients from Tom Cruise.
Here, he's struggling young actor Zack, who we first see planning a
pre-rave partner with fellow actor Adam (Scott Wolf) that, apparently,
requires mass quantities of frozen concentrated orange juice.  Fichtner was
last seen as the shuttle pilot in Armageddon, whose job was to delay the
movie so that Bruce Willis could wait until the last possible second to
destroy the asteroid.  In Go, Fichtner graduates from being the poor man's
Christopher Walken up to the relatively-well-off man's Christopher Walken.
He's got the same role that Kevin Spacey had in L.A. Confidential,
policeman to the stars, and if he plays the part with less panache than
Spacey, he more than makes up for it in creepiness.
But the real stars of Go are the younger actors, and they get a splendid
chance to shine here.  The first third of the movie focuses on the
aforementioned supermarket clerks.  Sarah Polley is nothing short of
hypnotic as the supermarket checker who decides, almost impulsively, to
branch out into drug sales.  You don't see that many anti-heroines out
there, but Polley is everything you'd want in such a character, smart,
tough, streetwise, brave, ready to take a risk, and ready to bail out if
the need arises.  Her sidechick is Katie Holmes, who appears to be on TV in
something called Dawson's Creek that I've never heard of.  She's got the
movie's first, enigmatic lines, but she mostly tags along behind Polley's
character.  Nathan Bexton does some good scene-stealing work as their
stoned friend.
In the second third of the movie, Go shifts abruptly from twisty drug
intrigue to full-scale male fantasy movie.  Young British actor Desmond
Askew and Taye Diggs tear a wide swath through Las Vegas, getting into more
trouble in half an hour than most of us can manage all year.  Askew is
interesting as a second-generation Austin Powers, ineptly roaming the
casinos.  Taye Diggs doesn't get much screen time, but manages to leave an
impression of being the incarnation of cool.
There are a couple more things I could say about the movie, but Go is at
its best when it manages to surprise the audience -- and it does so with
style.  Go is a surprisingly good movie with some really exceptional
ensemble performances by some talented young actors.  (It's not The Dirty
Dozen, of course, but what is nowadays?)

The director of one of my favorite films of all-time, SWINGERS (9.5/10),
Doug Liman, joins a hip script written by rookie scribe John August, slaps
in a bunch of young kids acting nutty, and demands you to GO see his movie!
PLOT:
Christmas time in Los Angeles just isn't like Christmas anywhere else. One
evening takes us through a drug deal gone bad, a rave scene gone right,
accidents galore, a fun "boys night" out in Vegas, shootings, homosexual
under-and overtones, and an all-around jolly time via the selected lives of
several slick teenage candidates.
CRITIQUE:
A mini-PULP FICTION for the quirky kids of today, this movie cranks you
through three separate stories taking place on the same night to a raving
cast of entertaining characters, chock-full of black humor, non-stop
excitement (except the third story, which was my least favorite of the
three), a pounding soundtrack, and all the originality that's been lacking
from every other crappy teenage flick to come down the pike this year.
Forget SHE'S ALL THAT (6.5/10) and NEVER BEEN KISSED (6/10), this movie
rolls their humdrum cinematic existences into a joint and smokes it! This
film's got punch, plenty of action, many over-the-top scenes, and a
convenient, but still satisfying ending, that'll have you crackin' up and
cringing all at the same time. The one sour note in the entire meal was the
"third story" which was particularly slower than the first two, and did
manage to bend my interest for a while, but all the same, the conclusion of
this film stapled my approval locked, stocked and two smoking barrels! (I
don't even know what that means, but the point is...I enjoyed this movie!)
All of the actors were effective, save for Jay Mohr who is just getting way
too many bit parts for his own good. Sarah Polley stood out in them all,
while the Vegas boys all deserve a tip of the hat. Director Liman is also to
be congratulated for making a film that is still fun, stylish, and quite
different from his well-known hit, SWINGERS. Both films do have an
underground scene and Vegas in common, but that's where the similarities
stop. GO plays with X-tasy, female lap dancing, oral sex jokes, and Amway
products, all tied up in a nice Christmas bow. I also like the separate
point of view way of telling each story, the drug-induced sequences (DAZED
AND CONFUSED, look out!), and the overall flow of the entire picture (save
part trois), which culminated into a fantastic, ravelicious conclusion. Now
if you've ever come home high as a kite, or wasted out of your gorge...or if
you've ever had one of those days that you wish would just go away...well,
slap them both together, add some drug-laced seasonings, a little pulp-noir,
a cast of hipsters and have yourself a jolly ol' Saint Nicholas of a time,
and don't forget to GO to this awesome, little movie!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This is writer John August's first produced movie screenplay. He is 27 years
old, and also served as co-producer on this film. He found his inspiration
for this film amid the checkout clerks at the rundown Ralphs Grocery on
Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, known as "Rock 'n' Roll Ralphs" due to its
proximity to various guitar academies. Originally written to be a short
film, the script-then titled "X" expanded over the next two years into its
current feature length.
Scott Wolf landed the first job he ever auditioned for and has continued to
work steadily ever since. He attended the same elementary school as Ian
Ziering from TV's "Beverly Hills 90210", and has a degree in Finance from
George Washington University.
You may remember actress Sarah Polley from her earlier role at the age of
nine in THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (8.5/10). Her character was named
Sally Salt. Later on in life, she dropped out of high school to become a
political activist for Socialist groups, and once tried to pick up JoBlo
Movie Emporium's own Coop the Scoop (read all about that incident here:
http://www.joblo.com/scoop3.htm).
Taye Diggs made his feature film debut starring opposite Angela Bassett in
the film adaptation of Terry McMillan's HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK. He's
born in New Jersey and counts Syracuse University as his alma matter.
Desmond Askew (the British guy) made his American feature film debut in this
movie.
Born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, Katie Holmes (middle name Noelle, which
means "Christmas" in French...She was born on December 18, 1978) began
acting in high school theater productions. She attended Notre Dame Academy,
which was an all-girls parochial school. While attending a national modeling
and talent convention in New York City, she met a manager who encouraged her
to come to Los Angeles for the television pilot season. Holmes landed the
role of Joey on the hit series "Dawson's Creek", the highest rated show on
the WB network.

Out of nowhere comes filmmaker Doug Liman's 'Go', a movie that contains
almost everything that Generation X moviegoers tend to fetish over: zany
characters, hilarious conversations, unpredictable scenarios and a
blazingly fast pace.  Liman worked with a script from debut screenwriter
John August, and it's a screenplay that is tight, well rounded and
beautifully integrated.  It's also masterfully manipulated by Liman, who
makes a film that is terrifically entertaining and immediately
intriguing.  In other words, 'Go' is one hellava time at the movies.
Why do critics and viewers persist in comparing films like 'Go' to 'Pulp
Fiction', even though it was made over four years ago?  It seems that
nowadays these kinds of films will inevitably be contrasted to
Tarantino's work whenever their characters delve into meaningless
conversations about such things as foot massages or cheeseburgers, or
when the use of guns become outrageous pieces of black comedy, or even
when a film's narrative doesn't follow a chronological flow.  'Go'
implements all these things, this time delivered by a young cast, who
give a fresh, youthful feel to the genre.
Todd: You come to me out of the blue asking to buy twenty hits of
ecstasy, twenty being the magic number at which intent to sell becomes
trafficking?
Ronna: Todd I would never fuck you like that.
Todd: How would you fuck me?
The story is separated into three distinct sections, each based around a
character's perception of the events that take place.  The first - and
probably the best - revolves around Ronna (Sarah Polley), who works as a
supermarket checkout and is under threat of being evicted from her home
unless she produces some serious dough fast.  So, she plans to sell
twenty hits of ecstasy to Adam (Scott Wolf) and Marcus (Taye Diggs), who
are friends of Simon (Desmond Askew), one of Ronna's fellow supermarket
employees.  The deal goes awry and Ronna is forced to make money by
ripping off people at a rave, with surprising results.  The second part
of the story centers around Simon and his friends as they create havoc
in Las Vegas, Simon especially having the time of his life before
landing himself into danger.
Simon's friend: Just so we're clear, you stole a car, shot a bouncer,
and had sex with two women?
The third section, more relaxed in pace and tone than the others,
regards Adam and Marcus, and a rather peculiar Christmas dinner in which
they dine with a strange policeman and his wife, whose absurd motives
for having them over gradually become evident.  Katie Holmes, of
'Dawson's Creek' fame, also has a part as Ronna's best friend Claire.
All cast members contribute energetic and thoroughly entertaining
performances, especially the gorgeous Sarah Polley, who stunned
audiences in Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter.'  Each actor gets at
least one hilarious and memorable moment.
'Go' is equipped with electric editing, paced to the rhythmic beat of a
rave.  It's the closest thing to a cinematic equivalence of Ecstasy that
I've ever seen - Go is vigorous, upbeat and bordering on the edge  of
brilliance; it's a Rockefeller Shank of a movie, powered by a script
that unfolds like clockwork and direction that's virtually seamless.
Intricately plotted and visually breathtaking, 'Go' is a great way to
spend a couple of hours at the movies, with a breadth of quirky
characters who always make you feel like you're in good company.  My
favorite movie so far in 1999 boasts a pulsating effectiveness in all
production aspects, and achieves a feat that some of the early efforts
of Tarantino also accomplished - it's an instant classic of the genre.
Todd: Ronna, I just gave you a favor.
Ronna: Here and I just thought you gave me head.

How many of you have attended a high school or college production of a
famous piece or work previously produced or published by some other form of
medium?  Perhaps you attended your children's Shakespearean productions when
they were in high school, or even grade school.  Did you like an amateur
production of 'Julius Caesar' or 'Hamlet' better than renderings by Marlon
Brando or the great Lord Laurence Olivier?  I hope not.  'Go!' looks and
feels like an amateur production of 'Pulp Fiction'.  I assume that for all
of you who are sports fans, that you also like the major leagues rather than
the minors.  Now, it's true that filmmakers, musicians and artists draw
influences from others who lived before them or put out stupendous work in
their lifetime based on advice from others who have worked along similar
lines, but there is a huge difference between drawing a variation of
someone's work in contrast to deliberately ripping it off.  Further
illustrating this point is that critics everywhere are comparing 'Go!' to
Quentin Tarantino's 1994 masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction' which probably has some
of the most memorable dialogue and repeated quotations since 1942's
'Casablanca'.  It certainly ranks up there with any memorable film script
you can think of.
Set in Los Angeles like 'Pulp Fiction' was (do they have to be that obvious
about it?) 'Go!' basically centres itself around four major characters.
There is Ronna (Sarah Polley), a supermarket clerk who hates her job.  She
works long hours for little pay and is facing eviction if she can't pay her
rent.  She has a plan to deal some drugs on the side and winds up double
crossing a drug dealer after losing her stash which could cost her her life.
There is Simon (Desmond Askew), who embarks on a trip to Las Vegas with
three friends and upon doing so they get mixed up with dancing girls,
prostitutes and a nasty bouncer and his criminal father. There are Zack and
Adam (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf).  They are facing criminal charges unless
they can help the police nab a suspect in which case the charges against
them will be dropped.  Other notable members of the cast Timothy Olyphant as
Todd, the drug dealer involved in Ronna's life.  Taye Diggs as Marcus,
Simon's main companion on the trip to Vegas and a cop named Burke (William
Fichtner) breathing down Zack and Adam's neck.  All of these stories take
place in conjunction with one another just like 'Pulp Fiction'.
In fairness, as I've said many times, a film should be judged on its own
merit but there are exceptions to the rule.  You can't help but compare
'Go!' to 'Pulp Fiction'.  What I really didn't like about 'Go!' was the fact
that while creating such a stark and obvious film, there is no development
on making the characters likable.  Many of the characters in 'Pulp Fiction'
were likable even though they were scum bags.  Tarantino had an uncanny way
of transmitting his vision to make it not only memorable but also separated
the good guys from the bad guys even though these were all wretched people.
You basically want to dismiss almost every character in 'Go!' as not likable
and the film gives you no one to root for.
The film is directed by Doug Liman who did 'Swingers' in 1996 and 'Getting
In' in 1994.  His style looks and feels a lot of Steven Soderbergh, George
Armitage and David Fincher.  Directors whose styles are better suited to a
technical job rather than as the man calling the shots on the set of a movie
in a very shallow and protracted manner.  It also seemed pretty clear that
'Go!' was trying to act as valid social commentary as well as entertainment.
It succeeds somewhat in doing so and the performances in the film are good
but the rest of the film and its attempt to put forward an original idea
just isn't there and the film comes off as aloof and totally forgettable.

Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)
1999, R, 103 minutes [1 hour, 43 minutes]
Starring: Sarah Polley (Ronna), Desmond Askew (Simon), Jay Mohr (Zack), Scott 
Wolf (Adam); written by John August; produced by Matt Freeman, Mickey 
Liddell, Paul Rosenberg; directed by Doug Liman.
Seen April 16, 1999 at 10 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, N.Y.), 
theater #15, by myself for free using my Hoyts' critic's pass. [Theater 
rating: ***1/2: very good seats, sound and picture]
        Do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just 
become part of a story? Everyone has their own life story, both past and 
present, and every time two or more interact, they become part of each 
others' story (not necessarily an important or even significant part, but a 
part nevertheless). That seems to be the basic theory behind `Go,' where 
several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways.
        In order to test this theory screenwriter John August and director 
Doug Liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types 
to have an entire film revolve around them, such as a teenage supermarket 
cashier, a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera 
actors. These types of characters might not sound all that original, but 
consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and 
his psychotic father, a mid-level drug dealer, a narc obsessed with 
multi-level-marketing, horny wedding guests, a Zen lovemaker, two 
shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out.
        How they will all come together is the process the film deals with. 
I'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing 
themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a 
terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general.
        The film starts out as anything else, with little indication of 
what's to come. We meet Ronna (Polley), a depressed Los Angeles checkout girl 
who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay 
her rent. She's not very charming, especially to her customers, but this is 
played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works. Maybe 
this is because she's not a very afeminite character, but she's far from 
masculine - a creative character indeed.
        Things start to progress when Ronna reluctantly agrees to take the 
hours of the goofy, hyperactive, yet likable Simon (Askew), an English teen 
into vices for the sake of the experiences. This agreement starts a 
three-pronged storyline as it allows Simon to go to Las Vegas for the weekend 
with his friends and in turn drags Ronna and her friends into buying and 
selling an experimental drug. The process of which will not only bring Ronna 
close to being arrested but also to death.
        Nearly the same can be said for two other characters, Zack (Mohr) and 
Adam (Wolf), who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting 
characters, but later will become major players to the film's makeup - 
another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how 
significant insignificant interaction might be.
        Once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle. 
When the title screen `Ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned 
turning point scene, it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard 
linear method of storytelling. Considering how good it is up until that 
point, it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today.
        And so the film begins to take shape, first by following Ronna and 
her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated 
by Zack and Adam (who were actually looking for Simon), which doesn't exactly 
go as planned, but that's what keeps it all so interesting.
        The second storyline starts at the same moment as Ronna's story, but 
this time the camera chooses to follow Simon instead. Simon and his three 
friends head to Vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience 
things they never would have imagined. 
        The third arc, about Zack and Adam, again overlaps with Ronna's story 
telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle. We're 
shown things we never would have expected were going on while following 
Ronna. And many of the events that do happen to Ronna because of Zack and 
Adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when 
they were.
        I'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and 
especially how the film wraps up in the end, but that would take up too much 
time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film. 
Perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and 
unpredictability, and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay, just 
through great filmmaking.
 Direction: Trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task 
and for a rookie filmmaker such as Liman, it's a great accomplishment. He 
doesn't just depict a story, he wraps us up in it all, pulling us into the 
fray so that we experience every high and low.
 Screenplay: Besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general, 
it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources, with both obvious 
and subtle references, yet it never screams `rip-off.' 
 Tone/mood: Where other Hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of 
the independents to the mainstream, this one is able to create its own sense 
of the macabre. It's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so 
satirical for it to be considered a black comedy, more like `macabre light.'
 Cinematography/art direction: Able to photograph both the intense and the 
lighthearted in the same manner.  
 Characterization: For nearly every character introduced, no matter what 
role they play in the big picture, we're able to get a sense of who they are, 
what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations. Even when 
their actions are surprising, it never seems very out of synch.
 Performances: Every actor nails their role (see above).
 Theme/theory: The film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind 
of political or social messages, instead, it's more of a philosophical 
experiment. In fact, it might not have meant to do that intentionally, but 
there definitely is something existential to it all.
...And to think that `Go' is just a big comedy and adventure!

Starring Desmond Askew, Katie Holmes, and Sarah Polley.
Directed by Doug Liman
Running Time: 1 hour 41 minutes
Taking a few tips from the Pulp Fiction school of filmmaking, Go is the new
feature from the director of the cult hit Swingers. The story centres around
a group of people, who include Brit Simon (Askew), and checkout girls Claire
(Holmes) and Ronna (Polley) and the misadventures that they get into, split
into three chapters. Everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in
a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than Swingers.
Although QT's touch is evident in nearly every frame, Go is entertaining
enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster
ride. Liman, who also photographed the film, has a deft touch with the
camera, and the film looks good. The film also seems to have benefited from
a budget, with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good.
There's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even
the darkest scenes get a smirk.
The young cast are talented and help bring the story to life. Holmes, one of
the Dawson's Creek cast (a show I'm not particularly fond of) displays much
talent here, and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a
three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature. Askew is
slightly successful, being rather obnoxious. No doubt the filmmakers
intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him, but
instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying. He drags down slightly one
of the funniest chapters, but the talent around him in that particular tale
more than makes up for it. The real standout is Sarah Polley as the drug
dealing checkout girl: her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes
the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining. Also
entertaining Timothy Olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer, who gives
an nice evil performance.
The script, written John August, is sharp and witty, with good dialogue and
some funny jokes. It starts off rather slow however, but in about twenty
minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better. The
stories are largely satisfying, although occasionally there's too much
attention on one detail but not on another. Also, some of the endings seem a
little forced and lucky. Still, the cast have a meaty script to get into and
obviously enjoy it. It could of tried a little harder in some parts however,
and these parts lag.
Because this is a Gen-Xer movie, the obligatory rave soundtrack must
accompany, and Go's one is pretty decent. Unlike other Gen-Xers movies, Go
never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue, which is a plus.
Go is a very easy movie to absorb into, and the audience really starts
feeling for these characters. Thankfully, they never become two dimensional
characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the
stories mechanics (like the heroine in 10 Things I Hate About You.) They are
who they are and they stay that way.
Go is great fun, and a worthy follow up from the director of Swingers.
Ignore the fact that it steals from Pulp Fiction and Very Bad Things, and
just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride. Erm, go to Go, I guess.

7th September 1999: Cineworld, Bristol 
Set in a world of sex, drugs and clubbing, Go tells three stories whose
characters and action intersect with each other at several points,
giving us different perspectives on the same events throughout the film. 
Simon (Desmond Askew) works in a supermarket and is minor drug dealer.
While he's away on a trip to Las Vegas, two strangers arrive seeking to
make use his services. In his absence, fellow worker Ronna (Sarah
Polley) sees an oportunity to make the money she needs to avoid
eviction. She tells the strangers she can get the drugs they want.
Meanwhile, Simon and his mates are upsetting some Las Vegas villians.
And aren't those strangers a little familar? In this film, nothing goes
to plan and much is not what it seems. 
The structural similarities to Pulp Fiction are glaring, and the
director Doug Liman, whose previous film was the indie minor classic
Swingers, must have been aware that Go would be branded a Pulp Fiction
rip-off. But he went ahead and did it anyway. Which is lucky for us,
because Go is great fun, with the characters in the three stories
finding themselves deep over their heads in criminal entanglements,
forcing each to make a hasty exit from their own sticky situation, hence
the film's title. 
A problem with the film is that most of the the main characters with
whom we are meant to identify are singularly unappealing, each being
involved in their own little scams or crooked deals. The film is far
from amoral, however, as comeuppances fly in from all directions. There
are a few implausibilities in the film, but that is more than made up
for by some clever confounding of audience expectations, especially in
the the last segment, which tells the story of Zack and Adam, a pair of
actors who in order to have a minor drugs charge dropped are helping the
police with some undercover work. The police office they work with,
excellently played by William Fichtner, becomes increasingly creepy, but
his motives are not what you expect. 
Go doesn't have the crisp exuberant visual style of Pulp Fiction, but
has a grittier, seedier feel which better suits the somewhat sordid
world in which the stories take place. It is fast-paced, well-written
fun, but is a little hollow and very derivative.

   "Go," Doug Liman's film using a faster-than-a-speeding-
bullet screenplay by John August, borrows mightily from the
genre made famous by Quentin Tarantino, to show the frantic
antics of a group of adventurous twenty-somethings.  "Go,"
which was the hit of the recent Sundance Festival left the
auditorium crammed, 1300 people staying out in the January
Utah cold.  We can see why.  "Go" has everything the
youthful generation and the young-at-heart seek from a
movie, all spinning before us at high-octane tempos.  The
movie juggles what passes for romance among 1990s youth
with car chases, drug deals gone awry, a weird cop,
a hip dude that seems to have come from the 1970s
blaxploitation genre, and altogether an assortment of people
whose daytime jobs belie their off-hour penchants.
   Dividing the non-linear story into three segments, each
from a different character's point of view, "Go" at first shows
us a dramatic incident in the life of a supermarket checker,
Ronna (Sarah Polley), and then, by exhibiting the same
actions from the viewpoints of the people with whom she
comes in contact gradually allows us to see the whole
picture.  After his debut film "Swingers"--a hip update of
"American Graffiti" with its entertaining look at single life in
L.A.--Liman has come back with a better-developed, more
mature black comedy with action that spills across the screen
at a breakneck pace with ultra-contemporary, sharp dialogue. 
   The opening story, which unfolds in a more involving style
than the subsequent pair, centers on young Ronna (Sarah
Polley), a supermarket checker who needs $300 fast to avoid
eviction on the following day.  Bypassing the usual drug
channels, she contacts drug dealer Todd Gaines (Timothy
Olyphant) and buys 20 hits of ecstasy for two customers,
Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr).  Taking the bottle to
her client's apartment, she senses that she is being
entrapped by a police officer, Burke (William Fichtner), and
takes rapid action to escape.
   In the second segment, which involves Ronna's co-worker
Simon (Desmond Askew), Simon and his friend Marcus (Taye
Diggs) get into hot water while enjoying a lap dance in a
Vegas topless bar, while in the final segment, the most
awkwardly paced letdown, Zack, his actor friend Adam, and
police officer Burke are working out a deal to get the young
men off the hook for drug dealing only to find out that the
older cop and his wife are even more adventurous and kinky
than they.
   Liman must have had barrels of fun shooting this
thoroughly contemporary tale of mayhem and escapades. 
Taye Diggs stands out as Simon's friend in Vegas, where he
is twice mistaken for an employee--first by a man using the
bathroom who tips him for being handed a towel, then by a
guy who hands him keys to park his sports car.  
   "Go" is loaded with all the surprises that a viewer should
rightfully expect from a film with Tarantino earmarks and is
highlighted by a sharp performance from Sarah Polley--who
wowed the Academy and the public as a vindictive teen in
Atom Egoyan's arty "The Sweet Hereafter."  There isn't a
mediocre piece of ensemble acting here, as Jay Mohr more
than redeems himself after suffering through the torpid New
Year's Eve embodied in "200 Cigarettes."  
   Next time you see those innocent young women pushing
those frozen peas through the laser beam in the
neighborhood supermarket or the kindly, nice looking fella
lounging lazily in the coffee shop, you'll be able to imagine
the far more potent lives they lead to compensate for the
hours of mere existence.  The ubiquitous posters advertising
the film do not do credit to the comely Sarah Polley, nor do
they justice to the zaniness that assails these buddies in this
crackling good story.

If there was ever a film that lived up to its title, then Go is that
film.  For one hour and forty minutes, the audience is subjected to a
story that never stops, a movie that never even comes close to slowing
down.  It's not that the film is relentless or action-packed; it's just
a perpetual motion machine, fuelled by skillful direction from Doug
Liman (Swingers) and by a poundingly-appropriate soundtrack.  I didn't
find myself emotionally involved in anything that happens in Go, but I
became curiously entranced with the picture by the end.  It works on a
visceral level, but not on many others.
It also has no obvious narrative, though there are several small
stories that Liman and screenwriter John August skillfully intertwine. 
The first revolves around Ronna (Sarah Polley), a grocery store clerk by
day.  At work, she's approached by Adam and Zack (Scott Wolf and Jay
Mohr), a couple of guys looking for Ecstasy.  She goes out with her two
friends, Claire (Katie Holmes) and Mannie (Nathan Bexton) to find some
drugs, thinking that on the way she can make a few bucks to pay for her
rent.  Another plot involves Simon (Desmond Askew), a Brit who works
with Ronna at the store.  He goes off to Vegas with his friends (Taye
Diggs, Breckin Meyer, and James Duval), and they end up getting into
trouble with a strip-joint owner (Jimmy Schubert) and is father (J.E.
Freeman).  There is also a segment dedicated to Adam and Zack, but that
one has the most surprises and shouldn't be described here.
Go is a film propelled entirely by style and acting, and that's not
necessarily a bad thing.  Liman, as I said, is very good at what he does
(I liked this picture more than the overrated Swingers).  There's a
certain eclectic quality about the scenes in Go, one of unpredictability
mixed with an acute sense of adventure.  August's smartly-crafted
(Tarantino-style) script helps underline this tone; the story overflows
with pop-culture references and ultracool dialogue, and so most viewers
under the age of thirty-five are likely to find Go a fast-paced blast. 
It also helps that most of the performances are so strong and memorable;
Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter) stands out among the crowd, never
failing to give her lines a punch of pointed cynicism.  William Fichtner
(Armageddon, Contact) is brilliant as a cop of a peculiar temperament,
one who is "open to new things."  Breckin Meyer has an incredibly funny
role as a white guy who wishes he were black.  I was impressed with both
Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf for their subtlety.  And Desmond Askew is a
likable kind of flawed hero, and constantly finds himself in
unexplainable situations (one of which involves two naked women and a
conflagration in a hotel room).
There are numerous scenes that don't work at all.  I didn't like the
one that involves a certain young woman getting nailed by a yellow
Miata; it's played for laughs, though it's not the slightest bit funny. 
This is later followed up by a scene in which the drivers of the Miata
attempt to dispose of the body, and it's generally unpleasant.  There
are also some points during which the characters are forced to be
incredibly stupid; when Simon and Marcus steal a Ferrari, I was rolling
my eyes and wondering what possessed them to do such a thing.  The real
problem is that Liman presents the material with such hip sarcasm that I
found it impossible to invest any kind of true feeling for the
characters.  But these aren't fatal flaws; Go is still an amazingly
entertaining film, one that is clearly in tune to the way people like
this think and talk.  And there's certainly no way it can bore you; one
thing you can count on is a whole lot of going.

    In Doug Liman's 1996 sleeper hit Swingers, he paid tribute to Quentin 
Tarantino's breakthrough film Reservoir Dogs by emulating a scene in which 
the main characters walk in slow motion to their cars. In his new film Go, he 
pays tribute to Mr. Tarantino at even greater length by telling his story 
from three different perspectives, which is part of what made Pulp Fiction so 
successful. In contrast to his 1996 film, which was very character-driven, Go 
relies heavily on visuals to deliver its impact.
    While some critics will call Mr. Liman a copycat, I would refrain from 
such surmise, for he is able to push the genre that Tarantino made famous as 
far as it can go.
    The central home where the story commences is a suburban supermarket, 
where bored clerks debate such questions as "are there any dead celebrities 
whose first name begins with an 'X.'" The often sardonic Ronna (Sarah Polley 
of The Sweet Hereafter) is desperately in need of cash so she won't be 
evicted. Her ebullient English co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew) helps by 
giving her his shift while he goes out of town. The visibly tired Ronna is 
awakened when two charming strangers, Zack (Jay Mohr) and Adam (Scott Wolf of 
Party of Five) ask her to step in for Simon in a drug buy. Financially 
strapped, she jumps at the chance and takes her friend Claire (Katie Holmes) 
with her.
    She able to score some Ecstasy from Burke (Timothy Olyphant), Simon's 
creepy drug supplier. This only after she has to give up Claire as collateral 
while she finds the money. Ronna's story will end at a raze where she is 
selling cold medicine to stoned partygoers. We only see a glimpse of her 
story's end, as the second one begins where the first one started: the 
supermarket.
    As in Swingers, Liman shoots the film himself and creates a fast paced 
energy that can be both dizzying and inviting. The speedy action matched with 
caustic dialogue can be most easily seen in the second story, that of Simon's 
Las Vegas spree. Along with his buddies, he indulges in gambling and lap 
dancing, finally culminating with a car chase on the Vegas strip. While this 
type of run-through may seem a bit cliché, Liman's jolt of energy and 
screenwriter John August's trenchant humor make the action seem all too 
original.
    The final story is that of Adam and Zack, two soap-opera stars that were 
eager to make a drug buy back at the supermarket. William Fichtner has a key 
role in this segment as an eccentric undercover cop whose ambiguities leave 
us wondering if whether or not he's gay. Even Adam and Zack are under 
suspicion when Claire sees them and makes the observation "Gay man are so 
hot. It's tragic."
    Liman doesn't use much excess light while shooting and doesn't seem to 
mind if a shadow is momentarily visible, "just like in real life," he says. 
While lacking the character depth of "Swingers," Go makes up for it with 
attitude and wit. Perhaps Mr. Liman has ever superceded the man he has paid 
tribute to as Hollywood's most precocious and bracing young director.

 Obviously inspired by the Coen Brothers, along with Quentin
Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," Doug Liman's "Go" is a dark, reckless
comedy/drama about some impulsive Los Angeles slackers whose lives
collide after a botched drug deal. The action takes place during a
period of 24 hours in the lives of three groups of people, and
first-time screenwriter John August's plot involves everything from a
bizarre Christmas Eve dinner to a trip to Las Vegas, with scenes of
drug deals, lap dancing, mate swapping, and tantric sex. And the story
is told from three points of view.  The ensemble cast includes Sarah
Polley ("The Sweet Hereafter") as a cool yet feisty, over-worked
supermarket clerk facing eviction; Katie Holmes (TV's "Dawson's
Creek"), who is trying to score some rent money; Jay Mohr ("Jerry
Maguire") and Scott Wolf (TV's "Party of Five"), playing soap opera
actors who get caught up in the middle of a sting operation. There are
many different characters and, somehow, during the three half-hour
segments, their wobbly paths dovetail, an obvious homage to the
strange coincidences of life.  Best known for his cult hit "Swingers"
(1996), Doug Liman also directed a low-budget comedy, "Getting In"
(1993), starring Calista Flockhart and Matthew Perry before they
landed TV roles; Jennifer Aniston was also supposed to be in that film
but the studio insisted on Kristy Swanson, who had just starred in
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer." With "Go," Limon again demonstrates his
cinematic eye for casting, as he also doubles as cinematographer,
keeping up a fast momentum. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Go" is a nasty, vulgar, crude, off-beat 6, obviously targeted at an
18-35 year-old audience who will also appreciate the loud, ultra-hip
soundtrack. It's been dubbed "a teen 'Pulp Fiction.'"
