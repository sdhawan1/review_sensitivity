If you're a filmmaker looking for a star for your next action picture, 
there isn't any better choice today than Russell Crowe (GLADIATOR), the 
star of Taylor Hackford's PROOF OF LIFE.  He exudes a controlled 
intensity that always seems just below the boiling point.  Bringing 
intelligence and quiet charisma to his parts, he adds something special 
that isn't flashy but isn't subtle either.  
Crowe's costar in PROOF OF LIFE is Meg Ryan, to whom he has been linked 
romantically in real life.  In the movie, in which there is supposed to 
be romantic sparks, the chemistry between Crowe and Ryan is as dead as a 
campfire extinguished a week ago.  Ryan, who has been terrific in a wide 
variety of roles from WHEN HARRY MEET SALLY... to COURAGE UNDER FIRE, 
never finds the right tone this time.  Employing a very limited 
emotional range, she spends much of the movie glassy-eyed, holding, but 
not smoking, a lit cigarette, as if it were some sort of fashion 
statement.  Her character, Alice Bowman, is called a "little hippie" by 
her husband, Peter (David Morse), but she poses and acts more like an 
ex-fashion model.
The story is about K and R (kidnap and ransom) negotiators.  With jobs 
that make Kevin Spacey's in THE NEGOTIATOR look like a tea party in 
comparison, K and R negotiators specialize in executive kidnap cases, in 
which they negotiate the ransom with the kidnappers, usually third world 
rebels.  We learn that paying what the rebels ask is like trying to 
eradicate the gophers in your backyard by sticking a hose in one of 
their holes and trying to drown them.  Yield entirely to the kidnapper's 
demands and your "final" payments keep getting turned into down 
payments, forever delaying the release of the victim.  So long as you 
get the right proof of life -- a photo of the victim holding a recent 
newspaper being popular -- and find just the right price point, you can 
get your client freed in a matter of mere months.
Much of the story involves endless haggling over the price between Terry 
Thorne (Crowe) and the South American rebels who have kidnapped Peter.  
Unless you're a car dealer by trade, you're likely to find that this 
part becomes tedious.  The first two-thirds of the film stays in low 
gear as the negotiations drone on.  Eventually, the movie is transformed 
into quite a credible and satisfying action picture, in which Terry's 
old sidekick, Dino (David Caruso), joins him in the fun.
"Things don't happen for a reason," Alice tells Terry.  "They just 
happen."  Tony Gilroy's script is like that.  Although it throws out 
some interesting ideas, it has trouble fashioning them into a compelling 
thriller.  But, all is not lost.  The movie does prominently feature 
Russell Crowe.
PROOF OF LIFE runs 2:15.  It is rated R for violence, language and some 
drug material and would be acceptable for teenagers.

Inspired by the 1998 Vanity Fair article "Adventures in the Ransom Trade,"
by William Prochnau, director Taylor Hackford tells the tale of American
engineer Peter Bowman who, while trying to build a dam in the remote wilds
of South America, is kidnapped by guerrillas and held for a $3 million
ransom. He is abandoned by his company, but his wife Alice (Meg Ryan) won't
give up on him as she seeks the help of K&R (kidnap and ransom) expert
Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe). But, things turn out to be far trickier than
expected as negotiations drag on for months and a romance develops between
Alice and Terry in "Proof of Life."
Helmer Taylor Hackford has always provided interesting, star studded films
from his romantic, Oscar-nominated "An Officer and a Gentlemen" through to
the satanically satiric "Devil's Advocate." With "Proof of Life," the
director/producer takes us into the secret world of kidnap and ransom. The
end of the Cold War, over a decade ago, resulted in the end of financial
backing by the Communist countries of various rebel groups worldwide.
Without that monetary help, the revolutionaries turned to kidnapping,
demanding huge ransoms from their victims, to cover their operating costs
and expand their power base. Kidnapping became such a popular means of
making lots of money that companies operating in high risk areas began
securing "K&R" insurance for their executives.
In "Proof of Life," Peter Bowman is in the South American country of Tecala
trying to get his vision built - a dam that will benefit the people of that
country. But, the engineer works for an oil company that is taking
advantage of the small country and its people by forcing an oil pipeline to
be built. Bowman becomes a pawn in the conflict when rebels from the
revolutionary group, ELT, put up a roadblock and take all the innocents
they stop as hostages. Of course, Peter is, as the most visible
representative of the capitalist oil corporation, a prime candidate for
huge ransom demands.
Bowman, forced to trek across the Andes with his captors, leaves behind his
wife, Alice, who turns to his company for help. K&R expert Terry Thorne
(Crowe) arrives on the scene and assures Alice that all will be well and
begins the delicate mission of securing Peter's freedom. But, corporate
skullduggery and greed soon prove to be more important and Alice is told
that there is no insurance, no company and no high level help to free her
husband. With Terry suddenly taken out of the picture, she and Peter's
sister, Janis (Pamela Reed), contact a local security firm to get Peter
released, only to find out that they just want her money.
A crisis of conscience forces Terry to return to Tecala to help Alice get
her husband back. The arduous ransom negotiations start to drag on
interminably, week after week after week, as Terry and his rebel contact,
Marco, barter over the life of the captive engineer. As the months go by,
Terry finds himself attracted to the pretty, vulnerable Alice as he works
to secure Peter's release. When negotiations fall apart, Thorne seeks the
assistance of an American K&R man, Dino (David Caruso), who is trying to
locate a kidnapped client of his own. Action replaces talk as Terry, Dino
and his team head into the jungle to extract their clients from the hands
of the rebels.
"Proof of Life" covers territory that has, until recently, remained in the
misted shroud of secrecy. The world of kidnap and ransom is populated by
former members of the CIA, FBI, Interpol, SAS and the military - men who
are used to "negotiating" with an opponent holding an AK-47 assault rifle
rather than a law book. The entire K&R industry was created by the social
and economic changes in the world, necessitating its birth as a hedge
against the lucrative abduction business. The story, provided by longtime
Hackford collaborator Tony Gilroy, opens our eyes to this, until now,
secret world that has changed the revolutionaries into drug dealers and
worshippers of the almighty dollar.
Gilroy's screenplay, while steeped in the unknown world of K&R, has the
feel of a re-creation of that greatest of American films, "Casablanca." The
parallels between that classic and "Proof of Life" are more than passing,
though the perspective is from a unique angle. Peter Bowman replaces Victor
Laszlo (Paul Henreid) as the leader of the cause that draws Terry Thorne
(filling in for Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)) into the fray as Peter's
potential savior. Meg Ryan takes Ingrid Bergman's place as the loyal wife
and love interest for Terry, while David Caruso's Dino takes over for
Captain Louis Renault (Claude Raines) as the good friend to the hero.
(Actually, at one point, I half expected Crowe to recite the "Of all the
gin joints in all the towns in all the world?" line from the older flick.)
"Proof of Life," even with the "Casablanca" comparison, is still a routine
thriller that walks through its paces well enough, but does nothing to try
to get beyond the routine. The most intriguing part of the film is the
story that follows Peter's plight while in the hands of his captors.
Bowman, before the abduction, is totally committed to his mission to help
the people of Tecala, putting the problems of getting his construction
underway ahead of the needs of Alice. Their last time together was fraught
with tension, but after the abduction, Alice becomes Peter's sole raison
d'etre, keeping the man from falling into utter despair as his
incarceration drags on. The romance that buds between Alice and Terry
simply adds a bit more controversy to the film.
The production of "Proof of Life" was reportedly plagued by disaster and
political intrigue throughout its making. The director made the decision to
shoot the film on location in Ecuador and Hackford and crew found
themselves flanked by two active volcanoes, mud slides and the same threat
of kidnapping that the story, itself, is about. There was also the
unfortunate death of a stand-in for David Morse that devastated the
production team. This list of woes has its impact on the film as there is
not a great deal of energy in the perfs by the principles, with the
exception of Morse who does a fine job in what amounts to a one man show.
Isolated from his wife and the life he knows, Morse's Peter must maintain
his will to survive with only a tattered photo of Alice as a reminder of
what he had. It's a close to the chest performance that says volumes with
little dialogue.
The stars of "Proof of Life," Ryan and Crowe, give performances that say
"star" rather than "actor." Both give credible perfs, but there is little
of the chemistry that we've heard so much of about the couple's off-screen
amour. Because there is little spark on screen between them, I found myself
more interested in the plight of Peter than the interplay between Alice and
Terry.
Supporting cast is a plus with a number of small, but effective, roles that
help to flesh out the background of the film. Pamela Reed is solid as Janis
Goodman, Peter's sister, who comes to Alice's aid. Reed gives strength to
the role as her character provides the moral support that Alice needs
during such trying times. David Caruso provides the sharp cynicism and
humor to his Dino that brought the actor to our attention years ago. I hope
this signals a comeback for the talented actor who has made some bad career
decisions. Anthony Heald, as oil company honcho Ted Fellner, brings the
same oily sleaziness to his character as he gave to his doomed doctor in
"The Silence of the Lambs." Gottfried John is terrific in the little role
of captive missionary, Eric Kessler, who is instrumental in Peter's
continued survival and rescue.
The behind the camera work, as one expects from a Taylor Hackford film, is
uniformly first class. Veteran Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak,
whose credits include such works as Krysztof Kieslowski's "The Double Life
of Veronique" and "Blue," gives a sharp lushness to the mountainous prison
of Peter, while bathing his and Alice's luxurious home in a warm light that
contrasts the harshness of the mountain locale. Bruno Rubeo, who wowed us
with his production design in "Devil's Advocate," gives the same level of
attention and detail to the varied sets in "Proof of Life."
In the end, "Proof of Life" is an exciting travelogue into a whole new
world of international intrigue that makes you think twice about travelling
in the hot zones. The generic adventure doesn't knock my socks off, but the
film does rep the craftsmanship and attention to detail that can accompany
a big Hollywood budget. I give it a B-.
Taylor Hackford's last two fiction features ("Devil's Advocate," "Dolores
Claiborne") both had striking visual styles, one of "Proof of Life's" 
strongest assets.  However, the story, inspired by the Vanity Fair
article "Adventures in the Ransom Trade" and adapted by Tony Gilroy (whose
credits include the Hackford films cited as well as stinkers "Bait" and
"Armageddon) and the articles author, William Prochnau, is far less exciting
than the gossip generated during the film's production.
Peter Bowman (David Morse, "Dancer in the Dark") is an idealist who's 
hooked up with an oil company to head their goodwill project - the building
of a dam for the people of Tecala (the fictional country stands in for
Ecuador, where the film was shot).  Bowman's in trouble though - the oil
company is on the verge of a takeover and he's being left in the lurch
with a full crew, no money and no equipment.  He's also going through 
difficult times with his hippie wife Alice (Meg Ryan), who's unhappy in
Tecala, while also blaming him for the miscarriage she suffered eight months
earlier in Africa.
As Peter drives back from his stalled construction site one day, the 
ELT, a former marxist group turned mercenary kidnappers and drug dealers,
storm a roadblock taking hostages.  Peter is led into the mountains and
Alice is left friendless in a foreign country to negotiate with kidnappers.
Enter Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe, "Gladiator"), a hostage negotiations
expert (the film begins with him making a daring rescue in Chechnya), who 
quickly reassures Alice and her sister-in-law Janis (Pamela
Reed, "Bean").  The next shoe drops when Alice is informed that the company
has left them uninsured and Thorne exits, leaving her to rely on exactly the
type of person he'd advised them to avoid - a local security man.  In an
inexplicable move, Thorne returns to save the day and begin the lengthy 
negotiations.
The film intercuts between two stories, one of which works far better than
the other.  Peter's ordeal with the ELT is a character study of a strong
and rebellious man fighting for survival.  Peter meets up with a 'mad
missionary,' Eric Kessler (fine support from Gottfried John), a former 
Foreign Legionnaire who's perfectly sane yet plays the fool with their 
captors.  The ELT are mostly interchangeable bad guys - filthy peasants 
with a predilection for partying, although their is a sympathetic woman as 
well as a strutting egoist whose demotion to pig herder sets up a grudge 
against Peter.
Meanwhile, things are fairly dull back with Alice and Terry.  He gets on
the radio and barters with a voice on the other end.  She uses cigarettes
as props and frets in the oversized sweaters costumed to make her look
vulnerable.  They're supposed to fall in love - we know this when Terry's
partner Dino (a terrific David Caruso) spies Alice casually drink out of 
Terry's glass.  While Dino gets suspicious, the audience is never given any
indication of the couple's passion when they're on screen alone.  Before
the big climatic ending, where Terry and Dino storm the ELT camp, there's
suddenly a kiss and some soulful staring.  An ending straight out of
"Casablanca" feels unearned (except for the beautiful relationship of
Terry and Dino).
Technically, the film's arduous location shoot mostly pays off.  The verdant
jungle scenes give the entire film a green theme, although some city
shots have a distractingly hyper-real quality.  Danny Elfman's score
complements the action without calling attention to itself.

In an article that inspired the action-thriller, "Proof of Life,"
William Prochnau wrote, "The huge number of multinational executives
being abducted abroad has made organized kidnapping a big business. It
has also spawned a counter-industry  getting them back  and a secret
drama involving former spies and revolutionaries, AK-47s and armored
cars, helicopter drops and hideaways." With source material as
provocative as that, the resultant film should be a knockout and "Proof
of Life" does contain some moments that deliver on its promise, but far
too much of the film is squandered on the most tedious aspects of a
cumbersome, ill-conceived storyline.
The production starts off right, with commando-turned-hostage negotiator
Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) dodging bullets in Chechnia while rescuing
a victim from his abductors. Shortly after returning home, he gets
dispatched to South America for another mission.
That mission is Peter Bowman (David Morse), an American engineer
snatched by the ELT, a guerrilla outfit that started as a Marxist
organization, but devolved into just a bunch of heavily-armed thugs who
kidnap for a living.
Terry meets with Alice (Meg Ryan), Peter's wife, and settles in for the
negotiations. Because their captive is a corporate employee, the ELT
demands millions. What they don't know is that the company is on the
verge of collapse and has not paid the kidnap insurance bills on its
staff for months. When Terry learns the cold financial truth, he splits,
but something draws him back and he becomes even more determined to come
up with a way to get Peter home.
So far, so good, but the story then settles into mediocrity, cutting
between segments of Peter being mistreated by his dope-smoking,
coke-snorting, gun-toting captors and interminable scenes of the
molasses-slow negotiation process and the growing quasi-romantic
relationship between Terry and Alice. The film eventually delivers a
rousing action set piece, but by then it's too little, too late.
"Proof of Life" is particularly frustrating because you can see the film
it should have been. Scenes between Terry and his adrenaline junkie
cohorts, particularly a jittery operative named Dino ("NYPD Blue" vet
David Caruso), deliver the sense of danger and immediacy that is missing
during most of the movie. The film screams for more edgy camaraderie,
for more adventure, for anything other than more dreary looks at a
half-assed romance.
And half-assed is the operative term. Aside from some intense gazing,
which can be interpreted several different ways, scant evidence of
romantic feelings appear onscreen. A love scene between Russell Crowe
and Meg Ryan was filmed, then scrapped by director Taylor Hackford.
Consequently, a smooch between Terry and Alice late in the film left me
thinking, "Where the hell did that come from?"
The incongruous kiss is just one part of a poorly written script that
plays like a rough draft rather than a finished product. Alice and Terry
are each assigned one painful burden in a pale attempt to flesh them
out. For Alice, it's the memory of a miscarriage. For Terry, it's the
knowledge that his globetrotting job has strained the relationship
between him and his son. Is anything of substance done with this
information? No.
The script is equally inept when depicting Peter's life in captivity,
shooting for a "Midnight Express" vibe, but failing because the captors
are left as stereotypes instead of people. The caricature status given
the terrorists is so blatant that, when one kidnapper displays an
exceptional level of animosity towards Peter, it's obvious he is merely
being set up as an identifiable target for the grand finale. Besides
Peter, only one character at the guerrilla camp is allowed to be human,
fellow prisoner Eric Kessler (Gottfried John, another white guy, of
course).
"Proof of Life" gives viewers a great beginning, solid action near the
end and a closing scene between Terry and Alice that wants to be
haunting and poetic, but falls flat because the script fails to provide
sufficient groundwork for the relationship. The film's long, droopy
middle leaves good actors straining to wring substance out of filler.
Russell Crowe uses his great physicality to carry the home-front portion
of the movie and the talented David Morse manages to add some oomph to
the anemic camp scenes, but Meg Ryan comes off as simply
inconsequential. In supporting roles, David Caruso is wiry and
appealing, while Pamela Reed is strong as Peter's fiercely protective
sister, even though the script quickly softens her fire and ships her
away.
Ultimately, "Proof of Life" takes a great idea and turns it into an
overlong exercise in missed opportunities, punctuated by a few powerful
sequences that show what would have happened had the writer focused on
psychology and adventure instead of uncooked mush.

Good films are hard to find these days.  Great films are beyond rare. 
Proof of Life, Russell Crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue
thriller, is one of those rare gems.  A taut drama laced with strong and
subtle acting, an intelligent script, and masterful directing, together
it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these
days, genuine motivation in a story that rings true.
Consider the strange coincidence of Russell Crowe's character in Proof
of Life making the moves on a distraught wife played by Meg Ryan's
character in the film -- all while the real Russell Crowe was hitching
up with married woman Meg Ryan in the outside world.  I haven't seen
this much chemistry between actors since McQueen and McGraw teamed up in
Peckinpah's masterpiece, The Getaway.
But enough with the gossip, let's get to the review.
The film revolves around the kidnapping of Peter Bowman (David Morse),
an American engineer working in South America who is kidnapped during a
mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers.  Upon discovering
his identity, the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million. 
The only problem is that the company Peter Bowman works for is being
auctioned off, and no one will step forward with the money.  With no
choice available to her, Bowman's wife Alice (Ryan) hires Terry Thorne
(Crowe), a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative, to arrange
the return of her husband.  But when things go wrong -- as they always
do in these situations -- Terry and his team (which includes the most
surprising casting choice of the year: David Caruso) take matters into
their own hands.
The film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and
creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with
well-written dialogue, shades of motivation, and convincing acting by
all the actors.  The script is based on both a book (The Long March To
Freedom) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations,
and the story has been sharply pieced together by Tony Gilroy,
screenwriter of The Devil's Advocate and Dolores Claiborne.
The biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between Crowe and
Ryan, but that between Crowe and David Caruso.  Dug out from B-movie
hell, Caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as Crowe's right hand gun
while providing most of the film's humor.  Ryan cries a lot and smokes
too many cigarettes, David Morse ends up getting everyone at the
guerilla camp to hate him, and Crowe provides another memorable acting
turn as the stoic, gunslinger character of Terry Thorne.
The most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes.  The
bulk of those scenes, which bookend the movie, work extremely well as
establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters. 
The scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and
poise.  Director Taylor Hackford mixes both his old-school style of
filmmaking with the dizziness of a Lars Von Trier film.
Proof of Life is a thinking man's action movie.  It is a film about the
choices men and women make in the face of love and war, and the
sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you
sleep at night.

   Lest you think the picture might be called "Woof of Life,"
this film--which takes place on the roof of life high in the
Ecuadorian Andes--is far from a dog.  But think of what
Costa-
Gavras could have done with the K&R (kidnap and ransom)
theme!  Slashing Tony Gilroy's script, which thoroughly
demonizes the South American terrorists by making them
virtually faceless and with only the slightest nuance of real
emotional feeling, Costa-Gavras would have given at least
equal time to the hardy mountaineers who live all-year-round
amid a gorgeous panorama  but without the use of toilets,
showers or L.L. Bean catalogues.  What really drives them,
and do they all think alike?  Imagine as well what Martin
Scorsese could have done with the smoldering romance
between a miscast Meg Ryan and the sexy Russell Crowe! 
In "The Age of Innocence," Scorsese successfully employs
Michele Pfeiffer as an unconsummated diversion for Daniel
Day-Lewis--bound to marry the socially equal but (to him)
unappealing Winona Ryder.  This we could believe.
   "Proof of Life" is apportioned into two motifs: one is the
struggle of Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) to work out a
ransom payment with a troupe of E.L.T. terrorists (patterned
perhaps by Peru's Marxist Sendero Luminoso guerrillas), who
have captured a man who works for an oil company, Peter
Bowman (David Morse).  Thorne is salaried by a large British
insurance company that guarantees executives the ransom
money should they be kidnapped.  The company uses
Thorne throughout the world's hotspots to negotiate the
exorbitant demands of abductors from outrageous initial sums
like six million dollars down to more reasonable six-figure
payoffs.  He is not asked to liberate the captives.  He merely
dickers with the abductors and delivers the cash.  The other
motif is Thorne's simmering liaison with Alice Bowman, the
victim's wife, who, together with the quarry's sister Janis
Goodman (Pamela Reed), is eager to gain Peter's release. At
least at first, that is. Given the obvious physical attraction of
Terry and Bowman--who have met with each other for a
period of over three months while the ransom is negotiated,
"Proof of Life" gains points by allowing the audience to
wonder whether they will throw the desperate Peter to the
wolves and take off together into the sunset.  To up the ante,
director Taylor Hackford captures a tumultuous scene that
could have come from Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf."  Before the abduction, Alice and Peter are
having a virtual knock- down, drag-out squabble, with Alice
insisting that they leave the (fictionally named) country of
Tecala in South America and return home to Dallas while
idealistic Peter contends that by building a dam, he is doing
considerable good for the population and must remain where
he is for a while longer.
    While Slawomir Idzak's camera captures all the
resplendent beauty of the stunning mountain ranges, land
wide enough to keep the guerrillas hidden from the
government for years, only a couple of scenes exploit the
dangers of traversing the slopes.  In one dramatic spectacle,
Eric Kessler (Gottfried John), a Bible-toting French missionary
who is tolerated by the guerrilla band by pretending that he is
insane, makes a grand leap that would be the envy of the
nightly divers at Acapulco's La Quebrada.  In another, Peter
is sent from one peak to another in a flimsy, would-be
funicular like a fluttering bed sheet whipped across a roped
trail by a sudden 100 mph gust.
   The action scenes are strictly by the numbers, starting with
a James Bond-like opening that displays the muscular Terry
Thorne delivering cash to desperate Chechen kidnappers
who must raise money to continue their battle for
independence against the Russian government.  The final
shootout involving the mowing down of abductors is not
without a few thrills, but there's nothing there that we haven't
seen in any video-games parlor.  Pamela Reed's Janis
Goodman is obviously a strong, independent woman of some
means but is reduced here to a wimpering, simpering
housefrau as dependent as the likewise weeply Alice
Bowman on the big strong savior.  And the armed band of
revolutionaries are shown as an undisciplined group of
cartoonish bandidos who have lost all awareness of their
political program and are simply in the business of making
money through a trade in cocaine.
   David Caruso turns in an appealing role as Dino, Terry's
competitor in the insurance negotiation business who lines up
behind him in a rescue effort. Russell Crowe is dependently
strong, taking moments out from time to time simply to
ponder his options as he did in the role of Ridley Scott's
eponymous Gladiator.  Though the film includes a few
product placements such as a Hertz rental station and a
passenger aircraft of British Airways, the real commercial is
for Ecuadorian tourism.  Who needs to get seasick gaping at
the turtles of Galapagos when you can ascend from the
colonial, cobble-stoned streets of Quito to the smashing
heights of the Ecuadorian Andes?  
Rated R.  Running time: 135 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

An expert in K&R (Kidnap and Ransom), Russell Crowe endeavors to rescue 
a disconcerted woman's husband down in South America. Despite 
complications to this mission, Crowe is magnificently steadfast. Ryan, 
however, seems uncomfortable in her role as the hippie housewife, even 
more comfortless is Pamela Reed as the victim's sister. 
No fault of Crowe's, following a compelling 10-minute 
opening/introduction to his line of work; a full fifty-minute lull 
abducts all but one moment of spectacle from film. Until surprisingly, 
it's the smallest of lines, "Okie dokie," that wakes me from my glossy 
daze. Another 10 minutes of commanding film from there, and again, the 
production eventually slides into messy back-and-forth dialogue with 
Ryan. "Who do you care about?" she shouts accusingly at the guy who has 
obviously come to her rescue. 
A room full of thugs draw their weapons and yet, civilians Ryan and 
Reed, stand up and shout at them. I don't find that too realistic, even 
the strongest willed of citizens would shut up at the sight of a gun and 
hit the floor! 
Then the story takes a short dip into uncharacteristic melodrama that 
sticks out like a sore thumb. Pausing from the normal serious dialogue 
and sparsely interjected action; Meg and hubby David Morse, though miles 
apart, express their longing for each other during a series of back to 
back dissolves. It did not work for me. 
At the end of the day (that's an Aussie phrase), Crowe's commanding 
performance stands out too strongly against the backdrop of this 
awkwardly paced, off balance production.

 Abduction of multinational executives has become big business
according to William Prochnau in a 1998 VANITY FAIR piece, "Adventures
In the Ransom Trade," the provocative article that inspired this
timely adventure story.  So, after an exciting, if bewildering,
opening sequence in which a hostage negotiator (Russell Crowe)
extracts a victim from war-torn Chechnya, the action switches to
Tecala, high in the Andes of Latin America, where an American engineer
(David Morse) is kidnapped and held for ransom. Abandoned by his
employer and insurance company, his "little hippie" wife (Meg Ryan)
and annoyingly strident sister (Pamela Reed) try to deal with the
guerrillas - until Russell Crowe, an expert in "K&R" (kidnap & ransom)
comes to their rescue, along with a fellow mercenary, David Caruso.
  Directed by Taylor Hackford from a script by Tony Gilroy,
this is a relevant, multi-layered, suspense-filled drama. Filmed in
London, Poland and Ecuador, it's no-expense-spared filmmaking, even as
it wallows in melodramatic moments. And, like "Casablanca," you're
left wondering right to the end if the leading lady will wind up in
the arms of her husband or his would-be savior. Flush from his success
in "Gladiator," Crowe offers further proof that he's a virile,
self-assured, charismatic leading man, while Meg Ryan embodies the
psychological torture inflicted on the wife. Their off-screen romantic
trysts which became tabloid fodder should fuel the box-office. David
Morse subtly shows the strain of captivity, but the Latinos,
unfortunately, are stock stereotypes, particularly the cocaine-crazed
bandidos. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Proof of Life" is a
high-tension 7. If you're looking for a thriller, this one delivers
the goods.

Proof of Life is the second of three movies slated for release at the
end of 2000 containing actors that were or are in real-life
relationships.  First, there was the `are they or aren't they' duo of
Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow in the surprisingly good Bounce. Later
this year, viewers will be treated to Traffic, which, in addition to
being one of the year's best films, features newlyweds Michael Douglas
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Sandwiched in the middle of these two strong
films is the decidedly lackluster Life, which boasts the presence of
current Hollywood cuddle-bunnies Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.
Life opens in Russia, with a 10-minute, hyper-edited segment that
introduces Terry Thorne (Crowe, Gladiator) as the Kidnap and Ransom
Specialist (or `K&R,' for the hostage-savvy) for London-based Luthan
Risk International.  Basically, he's a negotiator who excels at bringing
home people who have been kidnapped - assuming, of course, that the
victim is employed by a business that is insured by Luthan.
Meanwhile, in Tecala, South America (it's Ecuador, although the film
never mentions the name of the country), a young American couple is
settling in after bouncing around between various other third-world
countries.  Peter Bowman (David Morse, Dancer in the Dark) is building a
dam to save villages from being flooded, and his company is being taken
over by a large oil company planning to build a pipeline around the
dam.  His wife, Alice (Meg Ryan, Hanging Up), is a chain-smoking flower
child whose hair is too perfect to even pick out Ecuador on a map, let
alone live there.
Long story short, Peter is kidnapped by rebel fighters, and Luthan's K&R
man Terry is called in to save the day.  But Luthan finds out that
Peter's company dropped their kidnapping insurance during their
corporate transition, and Terry is forced to give up the job, despite
his interest in both the assignment and Alice's cute button nose.  But
will the allure of the case and the nose be too much for Terry to
ignore?  What do you think, stupid?
The film follows two stories  one featuring Peter and his painful
ordeal (in which he actually turns into Tom Hanks in Cast Away), while
the other concentrates on Alice and Terry's attempts to rescue Peter
from the crazy rebels.  The trouble is that neither of the stories is
interesting enough to carry the film, although the former is, by far,
the more interesting of the two.
Many viewers will be watching Proof closely to see if they can pinpoint
the instant Crowe and Ryan fell in love.  I'll answer that question for
those people right now  you can't.  Not only is the chemistry missing
between the two actors, there isn't any between the two characters,
either.  When Terry and Alice finally kiss, it seems as forced as the
laughter at a taping of Hollywood Squares.  I almost forgot there was
supposed to be a romantic angle to the story, and wondered afterward if
it was added at the last minute.  The film's trailer and poster make it
seem like Terry and Alice will be doing a lot of running around together
to find Peter, but it never materializes.
The horribly paced Proof was directed by Taylor Hackford (The Devil's
Advocate) and was nicely lensed by Slavomir Idziak (Gattaca).  The
script was written by Advocate's Tony Gilroy, who based the story on two
different sources  a Vanity Fair article about K&R men, and an
autobiography from the survivor of a Columbian guerilla kidnapping. This
would explain the two separate stories, but it doesn't explain why they
were both such a bore.  Proof is as dull, routine and as eventful as a
trip to the grocery store.  It's a taut thriller that is neither taut,
nor thrilling, and it's unnecessarily long, too.

Taylor Hackford's new drama, "Proof of Life," bears more than a passing 
resemblance to 1999's Harrison Ford-Kristen Scott-Thomas box-office dud, 
"Random Hearts." Although their storylines are very much different, both 
pictures feature an attractive, mature pair of actors in a movie that 
gradually turns into a romance. The problem with "Proof of Life," however, is 
the same problem that "Random Hearts" had, which is that the movie is just 
not a solid or effective example of successful filmmaking. Frigid and dreary, 
"Proof of Life" yearns to develop a touching romance between two people that 
can't, and probably shouldn't, get together, but we as the audience simply 
don't care about the outcome. The fact that stars Russell Crowe (2000's 
"Gladiator") and Meg Ryan (1998's "You've Got Mail") entered into the 
tabloids while filming due to a real-life romance that blossomed between the 
two, should have at least made the on-screen proceedings charismatic and 
lively, but they are not. The whole movie, ambitious as it may be, 
relentlessly flaps there like a fish suddenly pulled out of the water, 
gasping for its last few breaths.
Based on both a "Vanity Fair" article by William Prochnau, and a book by 
Thomas Hargrove entitled "The Long March to Freedom," Meg Ryan stars as Alice 
Bowman, a woman living in South America with her husband, Peter (David 
Morse), a dam engineer. Alice yearns to return to the U.S. and get back to 
her own life, but Peter keeps them put, as he is too dedicated on his latest 
project to give it up. When Peter is unexpectedly kidnapped by a group of 
guerilla-terrorists, being held for a $3-million ransom, expert hostage 
negotiator Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) is hired to ensure that he is not 
killed. But first, Terry insists that his newest clients give him and Alice 
proof that Peter is still alive. As the days tick by and Peter grows 
increasingly weak, weary, and bearded, Alice and Terry form a close, platonic 
work relationship that threatens to turn into something more.
That final piece of the premise is actually so inconsequential and 
next-to-non-existent up until the final twenty minutes of the lumbering 
135-minute running time that director Taylor Hackford fails miserably when he 
attempts to inject bittersweet poignancy to the final scene. As played out, 
it is entirely ineffectual and only leaves you wondering what, exactly, the 
point was.
What comes beforehand really isn't much better. While the plot is adequately 
intriguing and could have certainly been made into a genuinely suspenseful 
pot-boiler, the deliberately slow pace evaporates whatever tension might have 
been evoked with a stronger screenplay and tighter editor. The film simply 
sits there, immobile, for ridiculously long stretches that include exposition 
scene after exposition scene so poorly conceived you are akin to forgetting 
what was said by the next sequence.
In an obvious attempt to break free of the cutesy romantic comedies she is 
best known for, the usually reliable Meg Ryan is surprisingly mediocre as the 
grieving Alice. Either overacting to the point of annoyance, striking a 
superficial performance note, or misreading her character's supposed 
motivations, this is not one of Ryan's high points as an actress. It isn't 
entirely her fault, though; the role is so thanklessly two-dimensional that 
she does very little throughout but look upset and hold a cigarette (which, 
oddly enough, she not once is ever shown inhaling).
The supporting roles are stronger and more assured, but equally 
underdeveloped. David Morse (2000's phenomenal "Dancer in the Dark") is put 
through a great ordeal as he is shown being held captive and being put 
through torture from the beginning to end of the movie, but does little else. 
Pamela Reed (1990's "Kindergarten Cop"), as Peter's worried sister, is 
particularly funny and gets most of the good scenes in the first half. 
Finally, David Caruso, as Terry's wisecracking partner, is wasted.
There is one asset of "Proof of Life" that saves it from being an all-out, 
big-budget disaster. Russell Crowe, in his first starring role since the 
critically-acclaimed, audience-favorite "Gladiator," proves yet again why he 
is quickly becoming one of the most popular male actors in showbiz. So 
self-assured and brilliant in every respect, Crowe carries himself with a 
red-hot intensity that cannot be denied, and his work as Terry Thorne is yet 
another masterful turn in his gradually rising and hugely respectable 
filmography. Although his character, like all of the others, gets very little 
help from the thin written page, he is able to flesh out his role immensely 
just by a simple look, or the way he handles his lines. From 1992's "Romper 
Stomper," to 1997's "L.A. Confidential," to 1999's "The Insider," Russell 
Crowe does not play his characters as much as he lives and breathes through 
his personal creation of them. Simply put, he is the most talented actor 
appearing in films today.
Take Russell Crowe away from "Proof of Life" and what you ultimately have is 
a complete failure. Whenever he is onscreen, the film is tolerable and 
occasionally even interesting. Whenever he is absent, the movie threatens to 
drown in its own mustiness. Either way, director Hackford, whose 1997 
thriller "The Devil's Advocate" was far superior, has put a lot of time and 
money into a motion picture that adds up to very little, and practically 
screams out for a reedit. "Proof of Life" is right; without Crowe, the only 
proof of life in this unfortunate misfire would be the physical movements of 
the camera.

     Be prepared to be sorely disappointed if you go to PROOF OF LIFE
expecting to see the "Sparks A-Flyin' Between Meg and Russell Show." As
has been well-reported by entertainment news outlets, co-stars Meg Ryan
and Russell Crowe got a little thing going while filming PROOF OF LIFE.
It's the kind of story that provides publicity a studio just can't buy,
with voyeuristic viewers potentially taking the opportunity to watch a
filmed record of two attractive stars developing a major league case of
the hots for one another.
     As it happens, the relationship between Ryan and Crowe's characters
is the worst reason to see PROOF OF LIFE. In fact, the filmmakers seem to
do everything possible to make that relationship utterly inconsequential.
Ryan plays Alice Bowman, a woman whose husband (David Morse) is working on
a dam project for an American oil company in the fictional South American
country of Tecala. One day, Peter is kidnapped by a band of drug-producing
Marxist rebels, with the expectation that the oil company will pay a hefty
ransom. Enter Terry Thorne (Crowe), a kidnap and ransom consultant for the
oil company's insurer. He's ready to step in and run the negotiations
until the oil company confesses that financial woes and an imminent merger
deal will keep Terry off the case. But Terry ultimately decides to go
freelance, working closely with Alice to free Peter while Peter himself
faces daily challenges to body and mind.
     The reason Terry decides to go freelance has something to do with his
own major league case of the hots, only there's not much substance to that
particular sub-plot. There are two major co-conspirators in the failure of
PROOF OF LIFE's romantic angle: the timidity of director Taylor Hackford,
and the casting of Meg Ryan. The script by Tony Gilroy does a fine job of
setting up cracks in the Bowman's marriage, the kind that could easily
lead to some straying during a pressure-packed situation. But PROOF OF
LIFE only flirts with the bond forged between Alice and Terry, and
chickens out of throwing them into a full-blown affair (a sex scene shot
for the film was cut from the final version, apparently out of concern
that it would be caught up in the real-life story). Ryan, meanwhile, never
develops into a complete character, with a back story that's made up of
script assertions rather than performance. In a role like this, opposite a
dynamic screen actor like Crowe, it becomes obvious that Meg Ryan is a
Movie Star in a role that demands an actor.
     While PROOF OF LIFE's major selling point sits there limply in the
center of the film, there's plenty of great stuff going on around the
perimeter. Morse, a superb character actor who seems only to be getting
better with age, gets some wonderful scenes as he tries to cope with his
situation. His battles of will with one edgy rebel provide the film's most
tension-packed moments, and his strange friendship with a slightly mad
fellow hostage (Gottfried John) gives depth to his fear of what might
happen to him. There's more great material surrounding the details of
Terry's profession, including his friendship with a colleague played by
David Caruso (in a performance so vivid it just makes you want to cry over
his career choices). And there's Crowe himself, whose charisma boosts the
intensity of every scene he's in. As a film about the psychological
pressures of being a hostage, PROOF OF LIFE scores. As a film about the
psychological pressures of retrieving a hostage, PROOF OF LIFE scores.
     And as a film about the psychological pressures of being a hostage's
wife considering a little hanky-panky with the guy who's trying to
retrieve your husband, it whiffs. It may seem unfair to drag the actors'
personal lives into an evaluation of a film, but it's obvious from what's
not on the screen that the film itself was ultimately compromised by those
personal lives. PROOF OF LIFE had to give the on-screen relationship heat
in order to give meaning to the Bowmans' marital strife and to the quiet
heart-to-hearts between Alice and Terry. It doesn't. The genuine shame is
that it's such a strong piece of work in virtually every other respect
that it's still worth watching. PROOF OF LIFE will be a more enjoyable
experience for you if you go in expecting a thriller rather than an
incendiary screen romance -- especially when the filmmakers keep trying to
blow out the flames.

A disappointingly routine thriller considering the two headline stars
Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe are well suited for their roles (gossip has
it they found real romance together offscreen). Also, the locations
are gorgeous (actual location shots are in Ecuador's Quito wilderness)
and the escapist story about kidnap-and-ransom has enough of a tinge
of realism to catch one's interest...but all that is still not enough
to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots, bringing on a
dullness to its critical life-and-death situations, and falling into
cliché territory from the get-go, as the film failed to be anything
but trite -- a film that tried desperately to have a heart, but all it
has to show for its effort is that it looks like a typical Hollywood
action film, something tried and marketed many times before. A good
film to rest your brain cells and get carried away by the star's
screen presence. And, if you do not judge the film on a more critical
standard, I think you'll get your money's worth, that is, if you're in
the market for seeing a beautiful looking escapist film.
In "Proof of Life," kidnapping is played as a business deal. Peter
(Morse) and Alice Bowman (Meg) are a married couple suffering some
turbulence in their relationship due to constantly traveling to Third
World countries and that she just had a miscarriage 8 months ago in an
African country. They are stuck in the fictional Tecala, a backward
South American country, where he is an idealistic engineer building a
dam for the impoverished people under a dubious arrangement the country
has with a major oil company -- the company gets to put in an oil
pipeline and the country in return gets a dam, which the oil company
subcontracts out. Peter is the head engineer on the dam project for the
subcontractors, but carries around an oil company employment card. This
will work against him when the kidnappers get a hold of him and identify
him with the hated oil company.
During a police road blockade he gets snatched by the guerrillas, a
radical Marxist group called the ELT, who are now into the business of
cocaine dealing and kidnapping for ransom. They bring him to the
mountains and call him a gringo, capitalist pig, and hold him for an
outrageous ransom. Thinking that he is covered by the oil company's
insurance policy, Terry Thorne (Crowe), a former SAS commando now
working for a London based organization that does hostage negotiations
worldwide is asked to take the assignment to bring Peter back home.
In an unnecessary waste of good film stock, the film opens with Terry
heroically rescuing a kidnapping victim from Chechnya's guerrillas. That
flat Rambo-like chopper rescue is a rehearsal for the expected rescue
that will set the scene for the film's payoff, showing us beforehand
what Terry is capable of doing.
A twist in the story comes, after the divorced Terry meets Alice and
Peter's suburban-type soccer mom sister Janis (Reed), who leaves her
family in the States to help Alice in her ordeal. Terry gains their
confidence as the only one around who knows what he is doing, but he is
called off the case when his Kidnapping-and-Ransom organization learns
that the oil company has no insurance policy for Peter. Alice is forced
to be on her own and rely on corrupt local officials to handle the case,
something that Terry warned her she shouldn't do.
Unbelievably Terry returns to help Alice on his own and for free,
without his company's support. Evidently he has the hots for her, but
that, unfortunately, remains under wraps the whole film due to her guilt
and his reserve, except for a brief kiss, as he instead puts all his
energy into getting her husband back. It is now months since the
kidnapping and the story ambles along showing the difficulty in
negotiating and making contact with the ELT. It is shown that it is a
game they have to play with them to bring the price down to the $650,000
they could afford to pay.
Peter has a temper toward his captors and has a tough time adjusting
to the cruel treatment he receives, as his role is reduced to dealing
with his foot injury and trading barbs with his cruel captors. He is
only sustained by the thoughts of his wife and the comfort of a fellow
hostage, a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion and now a
missionary who pretends to be crazy (Gottfried). Meanwhile Terry has
fallen for Alice, but the story fails to make their benign
relationship interesting. Instead Terry takes a lot of time explaining
the guerrilla's mentality to her and the audience, and about the
situation they are in. It made for dull film fare, even though it
smacked of some semblance of truth.  This film just got butchered
because it was unable to be imaginative and make its exciting plot
line come alive. It just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade
into the jungles to rescue an American engineer from revolutionaries
who are caricatured as being stupid, cruel, lazy, and high on drugs.
The climactic commando rescue raid on the ELT in the jungle is led by
Terry and his fellow ransom expert (David Caruso)--in this country to
negotiate for an Italian hostage--and his band of indistinguishable
mercenaries. Their raid lacked any emotion, as did the film's final
scene between Crowe and Meg, where they shake hands and go their
separate ways after Morse comes home, even though the would-be lovers
know they love each other. Their romance was forgettable, leaving me
feeling too distant from the lovers and their flirtatious romance. It
certainly didn't have the impact of the romantic parting in
"Casablanca," an ending this film tried to emulate. The film just
didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story, or in its
generalized characterization of revolutionaries, oil moguls, and
heroes.

Inspired by the 1998 Vanity Fair article "Adventures in the Ransom Trade,"
by William Prochnau, director Taylor Hackford tells the tale of American
engineer Peter Bowman who, while trying to build a dam in the remote wilds
of South America, is kidnapped by guerrillas and held for a $3 million
ransom. He is abandoned by his company, but his wife Alice (Meg Ryan) won't
give up on him as she seeks the help of K&R (kidnap and ransom) expert
Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe). But, things turn out to be far trickier than
expected as negotiations drag on for months and a romance develops between
Alice and Terry in "Proof of Life."
Helmer Taylor Hackford has always provided interesting, star studded films
from his romantic, Oscar-nominated "An Officer and a Gentlemen" through to
the satanically satiric "Devil's Advocate." With "Proof of Life," the
director/producer takes us into the secret world of kidnap and ransom. The
end of the Cold War, over a decade ago, resulted in the end of financial
backing by the Communist countries of various rebel groups worldwide.
Without that monetary help, the revolutionaries turned to kidnapping,
demanding huge ransoms from their victims, to cover their operating costs
and expand their power base. Kidnapping became such a popular means of
making lots of money that companies operating in high risk areas began
securing "K&R" insurance for their executives.
In "Proof of Life," Peter Bowman is in the South American country of Tecala
trying to get his vision built - a dam that will benefit the people of that
country. But, the engineer works for an oil company that is taking
advantage of the small country and its people by forcing an oil pipeline to
be built. Bowman becomes a pawn in the conflict when rebels from the
revolutionary group, ELT, put up a roadblock and take all the innocents
they stop as hostages. Of course, Peter is, as the most visible
representative of the capitalist oil corporation, a prime candidate for
huge ransom demands.
Bowman, forced to trek across the Andes with his captors, leaves behind his
wife, Alice, who turns to his company for help. K&R expert Terry Thorne
(Crowe) arrives on the scene and assures Alice that all will be well and
begins the delicate mission of securing Peter's freedom. But, corporate
skullduggery and greed soon prove to be more important and Alice is told
that there is no insurance, no company and no high level help to free her
husband. With Terry suddenly taken out of the picture, she and Peter's
sister, Janis (Pamela Reed), contact a local security firm to get Peter
released, only to find out that they just want her money.
A crisis of conscience forces Terry to return to Tecala to help Alice get
her husband back. The arduous ransom negotiations start to drag on
interminably, week after week after week, as Terry and his rebel contact,
Marco, barter over the life of the captive engineer. As the months go by,
Terry finds himself attracted to the pretty, vulnerable Alice as he works
to secure Peter's release. When negotiations fall apart, Thorne seeks the
assistance of an American K&R man, Dino (David Caruso), who is trying to
locate a kidnapped client of his own. Action replaces talk as Terry, Dino
and his team head into the jungle to extract their clients from the hands
of the rebels.
"Proof of Life" covers territory that has, until recently, remained in the
misted shroud of secrecy. The world of kidnap and ransom is populated by
former members of the CIA, FBI, Interpol, SAS and the military - men who
are used to "negotiating" with an opponent holding an AK-47 assault rifle
rather than a law book. The entire K&R industry was created by the social
and economic changes in the world, necessitating its birth as a hedge
against the lucrative abduction business. The story, provided by longtime
Hackford collaborator Tony Gilroy, opens our eyes to this, until now,
secret world that has changed the revolutionaries into drug dealers and
worshippers of the almighty dollar.
Gilroy's screenplay, while steeped in the unknown world of K&R, has the
feel of a re-creation of that greatest of American films, "Casablanca." The
parallels between that classic and "Proof of Life" are more than passing,
though the perspective is from a unique angle. Peter Bowman replaces Victor
Laszlo (Paul Henreid) as the leader of the cause that draws Terry Thorne
(filling in for Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)) into the fray as Peter's
potential savior. Meg Ryan takes Ingrid Bergman's place as the loyal wife
and love interest for Terry, while David Caruso's Dino takes over for
Captain Louis Renault (Claude Raines) as the good friend to the hero.
(Actually, at one point, I half expected Crowe to recite the "Of all the
gin joints in all the towns in all the world?" line from the older flick.)
"Proof of Life," even with the "Casablanca" comparison, is still a routine
thriller that walks through its paces well enough, but does nothing to try
to get beyond the routine. The most intriguing part of the film is the
story that follows Peter's plight while in the hands of his captors.
Bowman, before the abduction, is totally committed to his mission to help
the people of Tecala, putting the problems of getting his construction
underway ahead of the needs of Alice. Their last time together was fraught
with tension, but after the abduction, Alice becomes Peter's sole raison
d'etre, keeping the man from falling into utter despair as his
incarceration drags on. The romance that buds between Alice and Terry
simply adds a bit more controversy to the film.
The production of "Proof of Life" was reportedly plagued by disaster and
political intrigue throughout its making. The director made the decision to
shoot the film on location in Ecuador and Hackford and crew found
themselves flanked by two active volcanoes, mud slides and the same threat
of kidnapping that the story, itself, is about. There was also the
unfortunate death of a stand-in for David Morse that devastated the
production team. This list of woes has its impact on the film as there is
not a great deal of energy in the perfs by the principles, with the
exception of Morse who does a fine job in what amounts to a one man show.
Isolated from his wife and the life he knows, Morse's Peter must maintain
his will to survive with only a tattered photo of Alice as a reminder of
what he had. It's a close to the chest performance that says volumes with
little dialogue.
The stars of "Proof of Life," Ryan and Crowe, give performances that say
"star" rather than "actor." Both give credible perfs, but there is little
of the chemistry that we've heard so much of about the couple's off-screen
amour. Because there is little spark on screen between them, I found myself
more interested in the plight of Peter than the interplay between Alice and
Terry.
Supporting cast is a plus with a number of small, but effective, roles that
help to flesh out the background of the film. Pamela Reed is solid as Janis
Goodman, Peter's sister, who comes to Alice's aid. Reed gives strength to
the role as her character provides the moral support that Alice needs
during such trying times. David Caruso provides the sharp cynicism and
humor to his Dino that brought the actor to our attention years ago. I hope
this signals a comeback for the talented actor who has made some bad career
decisions. Anthony Heald, as oil company honcho Ted Fellner, brings the
same oily sleaziness to his character as he gave to his doomed doctor in
"The Silence of the Lambs." Gottfried John is terrific in the little role
of captive missionary, Eric Kessler, who is instrumental in Peter's
continued survival and rescue.
The behind the camera work, as one expects from a Taylor Hackford film, is
uniformly first class. Veteran Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak,
whose credits include such works as Krysztof Kieslowski's "The Double Life
of Veronique" and "Blue," gives a sharp lushness to the mountainous prison
of Peter, while bathing his and Alice's luxurious home in a warm light that
contrasts the harshness of the mountain locale. Bruno Rubeo, who wowed us
with his production design in "Devil's Advocate," gives the same level of
attention and detail to the varied sets in "Proof of Life."
In the end, "Proof of Life" is an exciting travelogue into a whole new
world of international intrigue that makes you think twice about travelling
in the hot zones. The generic adventure doesn't knock my socks off, but the
film does rep the craftsmanship and attention to detail that can accompany
a big Hollywood budget. I give it a B-.

You Know Your Movie's In Trouble When...the normally stoic David Caruso
is the most lively person on screen.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Peter Bowman (David Morse), an Engineer for a multinational oil company
trying to build a well (as cover for their ultimate goal: to build an
oil pipeline which just so happens to be on the same lines as a drug
field), is kidnapped by the ELT, a South American Rebel Faction that is
more interested in "earning" money than in political gain.  After the
company which sent Peter to that country fails to support Peter in his
time of need, international kidnap and ransom agent Terry Thorne
(Russell Crowe), Terry's friend and partner, Dino (David Caruso), and
Peter's wife Alice (Meg Ryan), work closely together to try and bring
Peter safely home.  So closely together, in fact, that Terry starts
developing Feelings for Alice.
The Upshot:
The thing I hate most about yellowlight-worthy flicks is that while
there's not a lot *good* to point out within them, there's also nothing
so irreparably and completely *bad* about them that they won't give
*somebody* the idea to rant at me about why I keep Picking On their Star
Du Jour.  I'd druther have strong feelings about a movie, one way or
another, that would allow me to vigorously defend my stance to said
ranter.  Ambivalence sucks.
One positive thing PROOF OF LIFE had going for it, admittedly, was one
of the best character actors working today.  In the limited screen time
he had, David Morse as the kidnapee, far outclassed the rest of the
field; his was the only character of the bunch that I gave two figs
about coming out alive.
Meg Ryan's Damsel In Distress, in the person of Alice Bowman, at least
had the good graces to not be the same airheaded so-and-so Ryan seemed
so eager to play as a young Hollywood actress.  Indeed, her Alice was
reminiscent of one of Ryan's strongest characters yet, the
tough-as-nails Military Chick in COURAGE UNDER FIRE; Alice even *cries*
like Ryan's "Courage" character.  Which is to say, Alice had a very Been
There, Done That feel to her.  And though Crowe must still be riding
high from the success of GLADIATOR from earlier this year, he apparently
decided to play it safe in a minimally-defined role that might've been
much more interesting had it been more fully fleshed-out.
Of the supporters, Wolframio Benavides (as Juaco, the Hot-Headed Rebel)
and Morse shared a few interesting moments as a captor and his willful
captive; unfortunately, those moments weren't allowed enough room to
breathe and grow into a full-fleged Defining Event for either of the
actors or their characters.  Of the remaining main supporters, Pamela
Reed was far too screechy as Peter's older sister; and Caruso - who I so
dearly loved as Detective Kelly in his infamous NYPD BLUE role - *very*
quickly wore out his wildly-overacting welcome in a questionably
humorous supporting part.
The direction and writing was as unremarkable as the South American
scenery was beautiful; drop Stallone's "Rambo" in that jungle, maybe
you'd have a more thrilling (if not Meaningful) story.  The most
irritating thing about "Proof" is that it took forever to get to an
easily-anticipated Point that could've been more quickly achieved with
well more than half of it edited out.  My husband said it best when he,
uncharacteristically, left the theater to get a pop refill - and wasn't
very concerned about what he might miss in doing so.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I don't think I've had a "Latino Factor" yet.  To be honest, I don't
know if I'm qualified to address their Issues, especially not those
concerning [insert Latin/South American country here]'s Drug Trafficking
Problem.  Hell, I'm not really even sure what the proper terminology
used to address those who my fellow Americans once blindly grouped as
"Mexicans", would be ("Hispanic"?  "Latino"? Or as I've commonly heard
in the vernacular lately, "Brown"?)
I'd be more than happy to Lend This Space to someone more knowledgeable
of the LF than myself. While you're at it, I'd like to know if it's Just
Me, or is anyone else tired of the brunt of the blame for the
consequences of America's War On [Some] Drugs, being laid entirely at
the feet of [insert Latin/South American country here], with no blame
being assigned to the War On [Some] Drugs itself?
[Contestant]: "I'll take 'Proof Of Life' for $200, Alex"
[Alex]:  "It's our first Daily Double! The answer: 'What paramedics were
checking for after catatonic-looking audience members left the new movie
starring Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan...'"
PROOF OF LIFE (rating: yellowlight):
PROOF OF LIFE committed the unforgivable act of boring me to death.
