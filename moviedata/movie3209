Perhaps this film should be called an homage.  It certainly is a 
film very much in the spirit of David Mamet's HOUSE OF GAMES.  Two 
con men meet when the younger, Juan (played by Gaston Pauls) gets 
himself into trouble and the more experienced Marcos (Ricardo 
Darin) bails him out.  Marcos offers friendship and a one-day 
course in the short con.  He shows a restaurant con to give the 
illusion of having paid for his meal with a large bill.  But then 
he suggests that Juan help him on a bigger con.  The two will get 
their hands on a near perfect forgery of a plate of valuable rare 
postage stamps.  Soon the viewer is not sure who is doing what to 
whom.  Complicating matters is Valeria, Marco's successful sister 
who is less than pleased with her brother's occupation. 
NINE QUEENS was written and directed by Fabian Bielinsky of 
Argentina.  This is his first time as director.  He has created a 
sufficiently twisty plot, though the plot and situation is far 
from original.  It is a diverting enough puzzle when watching it 
and thinking of possibilities.  This is not a film that leaves one 
with a lot to think about but it is diverting.  I rate it a 6 on 
the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.
