IN SHORT: For once, a Bullock flick I didn't like. . .
Even while going through the alcoholic/pill-popper withdrawal that
occurs early on in 28 Days, the closest thing to a "heavy" flick Sandra
Bullock has done in the last few years, try as she might Bullock just
can't look bad. And while you might assume that, since the premise is
party-girl-in-forced-rehab, this flick is one bit of bad news after
another, you'd be wrong. It's not a giggle a minute,
let's-make-fun-of-the-addicts, laugh-fest either, though there is a
helluva lot more humor in the piece than you would expect. Once again,
we point the finger at director Betty Thomas who has, since moving up to
the movie director's chair after many years as a teevee actor on an
"obscure" show called Hill Street Blues), taken material that we all
thought was impossible to bring to the big screen (last time out with
Howard Stern's Private Parts) and made the impossible happen. A fistful
of talent and the earnest endeavors of her cast almost do it again.
Almost.
That's about as close to a rave as you're gonna get from me, 'cuz over
all this is one of those situations where good intentions fall flat and
we get just an OK movie.
Gwen Cummings (Bullock) is the party girl. She likes The Clash, beer (or
anything else suitably alcoholic to wash down the Vicodan pills she
pops) and night long sloppy sex with boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West).
Not necessarily in that order. When a nightmare hangover pushes Gwen to
reup the stupor levels, she ruins her sister Lily's wedding and in short
order trashes a wedding cake, a limousine, and a suburban home (complete
with ornamental lawn jockey, so un-PC these days, on its front lawn).
Given the choice of jail time or 28 days in rehab, Gwen chooses door
number two. . .
.. . . and is welcomed with open arms to Serenity Glen, a lovely oasis of
tranquility and positive affirmation out in the country. Here, Lawrence
Welk blares from the public address system, Bill Wither's "Lean on Me"
is transformed into a life enhancing chant and your first day includes a
full search of your possessions and confiscation of any cell phone,
coke, booze, pills, heroin, pot, syringes or glass objects (heck, if you
had to chant "Lean On Me" a dozen times a day, you'd wanna slash your
wrists, too!) that you'd try to sneak in.
Cigarettes are fine, though. Virtually all the characters smoke like
fiends. That may be the way it is in real life but that little
inconsistency is like a stone stuck in your shoe that you can't shake
out. It's always calling attention to itself. Onwards...
While the flick is filled with characters whose backgrounds are colorful
and just well developed enough that they're not stereotypes -- Gwen's 17
year old junkie roommate Andrea (Azura Skye), a famous baseball player
(Viggo Mortensen), a gay German guy (Alan Tudyk) whose problem even I
couldn't figure out -- Gwen must battle the question of whether to dump
her enabler (that would be Jasper) who willingly smuggles in booze and
pills (One at Gwen's request. The other as an attempt to lure her back
to the Dark Side) or shovel horsepoop with a smiling face (it's
therapeutic) for a month and then get back to "normal".
As proof that there is life after rehabilitation, we get to meet
Counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi). Buscemi's casting alone is such a
stroke of genius that I can only report that the sum of the parts is not
greater than the whole. Nor is it a total disaster. The plus is that the
flick doesn't resort to stereotypes for a cheap laugh. The minus is that
I didn't care even a whit for Bullock's Gwen.
That lack of sympathy doesn't come from my own baggage, which I've
always laid those out so you can decide if I've tinted the picture: I'm
virulently anti-drunk driving, having lost a dear friend to one. On the
flip side I go through a self-imposed detox every three months off the
addictive medications that keep me alive. Personally, I think one
offsets the other and now you know.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to 28 Days, he would have paid...
Pay per view level. As much as I adore Sandra Bullock (yeah, I do), I
didn't adore 28 Days.

28 Days, starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Diane Ladd,
Elizabeth Perkings, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tudyk, Mike O'Malley, Azura Skye, Reni
Santoni, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Margo Martindale.  Directed by Betty
Thomas.  Written by Susannah Grant.  2000.
   Will Smith has always been known as Mr. July 4th.  That is, until Wild Wild
West failed to continue Smith's wild success on the Independence Weekend.  An
equal analogy of Smith's usual success is Sandra Bullock's success during the
spring.  Forces of Nature, although critically lambasted, managed to rake in
$13.5 million and the top spot at the box office when it opened in March of
1999.  And while 28 Days's $10 million plus opening is not too shabby, it once
again shows that mediocre work does not fly far with audiences.
   28 Days is one of those delightful movies that provides you with good,
hearty laughs, only to disappoint when you finally realize the potential the
film has missed out on at the end.  The cast is a mixed bunch, with some
succeeding and some not.  Sandra Bullock, the star of the film, once again
proves her drawing power with a great performance that is only limited by the
script that confines her.  The mix of humor and drama as director Betty Thomas
examines a rehab clinic and its residents is both delightful and moving, but
continually bogged down by an unnecessary love triangle.  For some reason, the
Hollywood elite seem to insist on romantic subplots, no matter what is
happening in the main plot of the film.  Hoosiers, my favorite sports film
besides Rocky, was terrific - and would have been much better had the Gene
Hackman-Barbara Hershey romance been eliminated.  So much valuable time in 28
Days is wasted on developing a relationship that is not capable of being
understood in the first place, let alone at the end of the film.
   Sandra Bullock plays Gwen, a woman on the wild side who when asked of her
drug of choice, responds, "Do I have to choose just one?"  Gwen lives wildly,
and ultimately pays the price when she arrives at her sister's wedding on some
concoction that she cannot even decipher.  Gwen winds up in a rehab clinic, and
the comedy starts off strong.  Susannah Grant, who wrote the script, is
wittingly able to poke fun at the operations of a rehab clinic without
demeaning the actual progress that these clinics set out to achieve.  Jasper,
Gwen's boyfriend, makes his visits throughout the film.  At first, his
appearances do not represent the eventual and boring romantic subplot, but
rather, the problems that Gwen will have to confront after she completes her
rehab.  Jasper, played very sharply by Dominic West, is a great character to
have played this role.  That is, until Thomas directs his role to be that of
choice rather than that of progress.  Jasper slowly slips away from the
problems that Gwen will face when she returns to the real world into a choice
that Gwen will have to make, between Jasper and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson). 
Boone turns out to be a major league pitcher, and this touch of celebritydome
was tough to swallow, but 28 Days was strong enough at that point to have faith
in this character choice.  From this point on, 28 Days slowly rolls down hill.
   Interlaced throughout 28 Days are raspy flashbacks to the childhood of Gwen
and the problems that her mother encountered, which included drugs and alcohol,
just like Gwen.  The flashbacks are logical, but horribly explained.  Thomas
and Grant automatically assume that a mother's influence will be passed down to
her offspring.  Thomas never establishes why Gwen has such a tight bond with
her mother.  Logic, which 28 Days ignores at its most critical moments, would
suggest that Gwen would be turned off to drugs and alcohol because of this
horrible experience.  Thomas never confronts this, however.  But, Gwen could
also be doomed for her mother's fate because of these experiences as well. 
While this turns out to be the outcome, Thomas never ventures into the reasons
why.  Therefore, all the audience is left with are raspy and jerky flashbacks
to a childhood that never fully connects with Gwen's adulthood.
   While 28 Days definitely has its problems, it nonetheless provides its fair
share of entertainment.  Bullock's charm gushes off of the screen, and when
Thomas focuses on the humor and intricacies of each character, the audience is
either laughing or moved, and the feeling is always justified.
   Sandra Bullock may not have a huge hit with 28 Days, but she once again
proves why she her contingency is continually growing.  Her performance is
top-notch, and if she gets a hold of a superior script, maybe she can progress
from spring into Will Smith territory...But only time will tell, but she will
definitely need more than 28 Days.

The most honest film I've seen about the Recovery Process is Al
Franken's much maligned "Stuart Saves His Family." The 1995 feature, a
spin-off from "Saturday Night Live," centers on Franken's Stuart Smalley
character, a maddening, but endearing little guy who belongs to several
12-step programs. Flinging around Recovery slogans ("denial isn't only a
river in Egypt," "that's just stinkin' thinkin'") like confetti at a
parade, Stuart struggles to break free from his obsessive-compulsive
behavior patterns, generally taking two steps forward and three steps
back.
"Stuart Saves His Family" was a critical and commercial flop, but videos
of the movie remain hot properties on the 12-step circuit, because
members appreciate the warts-and-all portrayal of a man determined to
become a better person.
Although the subject matter is similar, "28 Days" is the antithesis of
"Stuart Saves His Family." The film plays like an escapee from the
Lifetime Channel, boosted only by the talents of Sandra Bullock. This is
a star vehicle and, while there are scattered affecting moments, the
production is glib and overly pat, often using humor inappropriately.
Take the wedding scene, for example. After too much partying with her
boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), Gwen Cummings (Bullock) shows up late
to perform bridesmaid duties for her sister, Lily (Elizabeth Perkins).
Gwen's tardiness is just the beginning, though. The drunk young woman
insults the newlyweds during a toast, loses balance while dancing and
falls on the wedding cake, takes off to replace the cake by stealing the
couple's limo, then careens for several blocks before crashing into the
front of a house.
Director Betty Thomas plays the situation for laughs and, judging from
the howling audience at the screening I attended, it appears that
driving while intoxicated isn't appalling  it's funny.
The court system in Movie Land doesn't take it that seriously, either.
Instead of throwing her ass in prison, Gwen is allowed to opt for a mere
28 days in rehab rather than jail. With a massive chip on her shoulder,
she arrives at Serenity Glen, a New-Agey recovery center that
specializes in group chants and sing-alongs.
Thomas shoots for a "M*A*S*H" motif  throughout the film, we hear wacky
announcements over the P.A. system and Loudon Wainwright III, who served
as official camp troubadour on a few episodes of the TV series, does
another tour of duty here. Gwen is surrounded by a group of
one-dimensional fellow patients: tough-as-nails Roshanda (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste), self-loathing Daniel (Reni Santoni), wise guy Oliver
(Mike O'Malley), sacrificial lamb Andrea (Azura Skye) and
easy-target-for-cheap-laughs Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), a gay German
stripper who comes off like the "Sprockets" version of Andy Dick. What a
shame it is to see so many fine character actors used as little more
than props.
Two bits of inspired casting offer brief hope for greater things. Steve
Buscemi, who has popped up as the weird guy in virtually every film made
over the past decade, plays a well-balanced counselor, and Viggo
Mortensen, a specialist in portraying smarmy heels, appeared as a
baseball star who, substance abuse problems aside, is a clean-cut,
stand-up sort of man. Unfortunately, neither actor is given much to do,
as the spotlight remains firmly on Gwen.
Sandra Bullock is good  she generally does her best work when given a
character placed in an extremely tense situation  but Gwen's journey is
too easy. As Stuart Smalley can tell you, breaking self-destructive
behavior patterns is tough business. Compared to what most people
endure, Gwen's rehabilitation is a cakewalk. Revelations and
reconciliation come in tidy little packages, with just enough angst
thrown in to allow Bullock to strut her stuff.
Anyone who has dealt with drug addiction, codependency, compulsive
eating, gambling, etc. can tell you that a key to the recovery process
is learning that, while you are a vital part of the human tapestry, you
are most certainly not the center of the world. "28 Days" trivializes
what it seeks to honor by placing one character's concerns above all
others, and by milking potentially deadly actions for laughs. Sorry,
Sandra, but I'll take the awkward, messy "Stuart Saves His Family" over
faux grit like this anytime.

Starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth
Perkins, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tyduk. Directed by Betty Thomas. Rated PG-
13.
I often wonder why so many writers choose a mental institution of some
sort as the setting for their movie. The most plausible explanation is
the potential for quirky supporting characters -- you need look no
further for colorful personalities than a group of basketcases and
preferably drug addicted ones. It also gives a screenwriter a picture-
perfect set-up for an ordinary-person-placed-in-group-of-eccentric-
misfits plot, a favorite in Hollywood for years. The quitessential
mental hospital movie is, of course, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;
there have since been many imitators. The latest entry into the genre
is the Sandra Bullock vehicle 28 Days, a superficially entertaining
drama that doesn't bother to expand on its concept much beyond a
skeleton. The characters are enjoyable; the plot is wafer-thin.
In this version, Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a happy-go-lucky
alcoholic who doesn't realize that she has a problem until she falls on
her sister's wedding cake and, in an effort to find a replacement,
crashes the "just married" limousine into a house. In her trial, which
the film (for better or worse) skips over, she is sentenced to either
28 days of drug rehab or the equivalent time in jail. Not wishing to
spend time in the slammer, Gwen understandably chooses the former. She
arrives at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center where people
basically chant 24/7 (as a substitute for prayer, she is told). Of
course, she's high above all of these freaks, utterly convinced that
she can stop using any time she wants to.
The only person who liked Gwen the way she was before rehab was her
boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West). He comes to visit Gwen at Serenity
Glen, taking her out on boatrides and the like, never forgetting to
bring along a bottle of champagne. This is about the time when Gwen
starts getting serious about kicking the habit. She resents her
boyfriend's attempts to turn her back into the mess of a person she was
before and gets involved with a baseball pitcher (Viggo Mortensen) who
is also in rehab.
28 Days is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a melodramatic tale
of a woman discovering her worth as a person and that life can be good
without booze. It's nothing groundbreaking, certainly, and director
Betty Thomas (Private Parts) doesn't even suggest that there might be
something here that is beyond the self-evident. Still, there is
something to be said for a film that remains so watchable even when
it's so obviously taking all the easy ways out. This is hardly The Road
Less Traveled, but this highway is so smooth that it's a comfortable
ride.
The film owes its success, in large part, to the typically likable lead
performance by Sandra Bullock. We root for Gwen because Bullock makes
it so apparent that she doesn't know any better; that the only path
through life that anyone has ever shown her has been this destructive
one. As she finally begins to wise up around the middle of the movie,
we can't help but cheer her on. By the same token, Dominic West makes
Jasper an effective bastard without foaming from the mouth; we despise
him, but can imagine why Gwen was attracted to him in the first place.
The characterization is simple, but it works.
Probably the only undisputed triumph here is the ending, which is sweet
without being saccharine and nicely underscores the idea of positive
human interaction instead of mind-altering substances. Despite
everything, I became attached to Gwen Cummings during the course of the
movie and its conclusion made me walk out with a smile.
The most remarkable thing about 28 Days is that it is being marketed as
a comedy. I guess the marketers thought that no one in their right mind
would attend a drug rehab movie that's not magically hilarious so they
spliced together random clips from the film and made it seem like a
laughfest. The film is not downbeat and it isn't depressing, but it
certainly is not a comedy. As a drama, it's nothing special, but I must
admit I enjoyed it and, at times, was even touched. Maybe next time
someone will actually take some chances with the genre.

Susan Granger's review of "28 DAYS" (Columbia Pictures)
The girl-next-door has grown up. Sandra Bullock takes a brave
dramatic leap as a drunk stumbling on her way to sobriety in this
contemporary cautionary tale. Written by Susannah Grant ("Erin
Brockovich"), the story begins with Sandra reeling around Mahattan in
a boozy haze. She's a drinking, drugging party girl and the debauchery
never stops, even at the wedding of her sister (Elizabeth Perkins).
But when she swipes a limo and crashes it into the front porch of a
house, she gets a DUI and 28 days in court-ordered rehab. And that's a
real awakening. Defensive and heavily into denial, she first has to be
convinced that she is, indeed, an addict. Then she has to want to live
a different life, even if that means ditching her good-time boy-friend
(Dominic West) who'd like to marry her. But the core of the story
takes place in the rehab community, where she meets a motley
assortment of characters including her counselor (Steve Buscemi),
heroin-addicted roommate (Azura Skye), an irresistible gay German
(Alan Tudyk) - who has the best dialogue in the picture - and a
testosterone-laden baseball player (Viggo Mortensen). Yet the vision
of director Betty Thomas seems unfocused, skipping from slapstick
comedy to fuzzy memory flashbacks, from a silly riff on soap operas to
a romance that never develops, all within the serious substance-abuse
concept. Think of capturing the gallows humor of "Girl, Interrupted."
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "28 Days" is a scrambled 7. But
Sandra Bullock shines. She's a revelation, delivering a compelling,
surprisingly convincing performance after her recent falters in "Hope
Floats" and "Forces of Nature." Even when she's bruised and battered,
she's beautiful, bringing a haunting sadness to her portrayal.

Every now and then a movie comes out which is directed entirely at one
audience. I'm not talking about a film like "Hanging Up", which is directed
entirely at middle aged women; or "The Beach", which has a target audience
comprised only of teenage girls. I mean that the target audience of Sandra
Bullock's "28 Days" must be people who are, or have been, addicted to
alcohol, drugs, or sex. At least this is the conclusion I've reached since I
have never been addicted to anything, and I got almost nothing from this
film. I think if you have been an addict at some point in your life, the
trials of a woman going through rehab would have some meaning for you. That
isn't to say "28 Days" doesn't have its share of funny moments for the rest
of us, but the majority of the film will most likely mean nothing to you.
Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) was always the life of the party. She and her
boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), lead lives which consist of drinking hard,
sleeping in late, and forgetting about the previous evening's activities.
However, when she ruins her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding and smashes
a limo into some poor soul's house, she is sentenced to twenty eight days of
rehab. While in rehab she meets a host of unusual fellow addicts like Eddie
(Viggo Mortensen), a major league ball player who is addicted to cocaine and
sex; and Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), a gay, German stripper who is addicted to
god only knows what. She also meets her therapist, Cornell (an oddly sane
Steve Buscemi), who is a recovered compulsive gambler and drug addict. While
she is convinced she has no problem at first, it slowly dawns on Gwen that
she may have a strong addiction afterall.
There were a couple of things about "28 Days" that I liked. First of all, I
thought Sandra Bullock did a great job in her first leading role in some
time. After a series of flops ("Forces of Nature", "Hope Floats") she needed
to show that she could carry a movie on her shoulders alone (though I may
have enjoyed it, I must admit that "Gun Shy" was not the movie needed to
revive her career). Second, the humor may fall flat most of the time, but
there is an occasional truly hilarious scene. Now, besides the fact that the
movie clearly wasn't directed at a person like me, there are a few other
things working against "28 Days". First, the soundtrack does nothing for the
film. Filled with high spirited songs, everything played throughout the
movie felt totally out of place. Second, flashbacks are shot in a confused,
disjointed home video style which doesn't add anything. Third, I've seen few
movies that have underdeveloped their characters to such an extent. For
example, Steve Buscemi plays what could have been a very interesting
character, but he is given almost no screen time.
As for the cast, the supporting actors would probably have done just fine if
given more to work with. Steve Buscemi shows that he can play a normal
character as opposed to the psychopaths he plays in "Reservoir Dogs" and
"Fargo". Viggo Mortensen ("Crimson Tide", "G.I. Jane") nicely underplays his
part as Gwen's potential love interest, but again, he is given very little
screen time. The funniest supporting actor is certainly Alan Tudyk ("Patch
Adams"), who shamelessly overacts, but in such a hilarious way that it is
easy to forgive. As good as these actors may be, they can do nothing with
these roles because we are given no information about the characters except
that they have all been addicted to something at some point in their lives.
As far as direction goes, Betty Thomas ("Doctor Doolittle", "Private Parts")
keeps the film strangely frantic in pacing. For example, Gwen ends up in
rehab about eight minutes into the movie, before we get to know anything
about her. You can also add "28 Days" to that ever growing list of movies
that don't exactly end, but just sort of stop in mid scene. I suppose the
only people I can recommend this movie to are recovered or recovering
alcoholics and former drug addicts. I can't quite recommend it to fans of
Sandra Bullock since she has certainly had better material to work with in
the past. Go rent "Speed" or "Demolition Man" (yes, I like "Demolition Man")
unless you're dying for a chick flick. "28 Days" runs only 103 minutes, but
it feels quite a bit longer. I give it three out of five stars.

28 DAYS (2000) by JOHN SYLVA, associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)    
Consider it for a moment.  Think about having to give up your hobby or passion
for 28 straight days.  Whether it is smoking, gambling, a loved one, or in my
case the internet- How could you possibly survive those grueling days without
it?  Every ordinary American has an addiction, and Gwen Cummings, an ordinary
American, has an addiction, and for her that addiction is alcohol and pain
pills.  After a troubling turn of events, Gwen will be admitted to a
rehabilitation center for 28 days, not able to have an ounce of alcohol, or
even one her pain pills that she so loves. As the film progresses, we see her
learn and grow as a person, as she realizes that her lifestyle is no way to
live.  The plot sounds schmaltzy and shallow, but the Betty Thomas flick "28
Days" brings the pain that Gwen (Sandra Bullock) must live through into a
touching reality, in a way that is both humorous yet dramatic, powerful yet
light.
Gwen Cummings is a character of charisma, tragedy, and self centeredness; What
one would consider the life of the party.  That is, before she gets a life. 
After making a scene (not to mention ruining it as well) at her sister's
wedding, followed by a house/car accident, Gwen is admitted to the Serenity
Glen rehabilitation center, where every night and day is filled with plenty of
soberness, chants, prayers, and "Lean on Me."  Gwen slowly comes to the
realization that she needs to grow up and give up what has made a complete mess
of her life, alcohol.  Along the way, Gwen befriends a number of other
patients, including her coke addict roommate Andrea (Azura Skye), and clean cut
baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson), whom she grows a deep affection
for.
"28 Days" bends between a fine line of comedy and drama it's entire 103 minute
running time, presenting both the comedic and dramatic elements of alcoholism
and ultimately overcoming it.  The latter is shown mostly through effective
flashbacks, showing Gwen's mother's problems with alcohol that resulted in her
death, and the comedic element brought through the rehab center's obsession
with the campy soap opera "Santa Cruz."  The pacing is perfect, with everything
meshing together nicely, thanks to Susannah Grant's superb screenplay.  
Almost everything is shining brightly in "28 Days," but nothing is shining half
as bright as Sandra Bullock.  Bullock digs herself out of a hole that she was
in as a result of films such as 1998's horrid "Practical Magic" and 1999's
mediocre "Forces of Nature."  Bullock is realistic and touching as her troubled
character, fulfilling her character's hardships as an alcoholic flawlessly.  
"28 Days" is a film that doesn't delve deep into the psychological aspects of
addiction, instead it just focuses on the lighter human aspects, ones that any
human being can relate to and understand with ease.  At one point, we see Gwen
at a stage so horrible that she is shaking, her face pale as ghost; She's at a
stage of total hazard.  Scenes like this in "28 Days" make it easy to relate
to, although we never completely understand all of the elements of Gwen's life
or her background, or how her mind works, but the point is that we don't need
to.  Because the film is so effortless and light, anyone can sit down and
relate to her character's life.  "28 Days" has its flaws, but if you can look
past the fact that the story has been done before, and that it's not
necessarily the best thing since sliced bread, you'll find yourself a nice
little slice of life.
The Bottom Line: Bullock gives an amazing performance in a simple, touching
film. A treasure.

O'Malley), Comic Relief/Sensitive Guy Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), 
ObBlackResident Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), addict and celebrity 
baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), and even her ex-addict 
counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi)--all learning to Live Life One Day At 
A Time.
The Upshot:
One of these days, I'd like for someone to explain to me just what the 
difference between Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock is.  Besides the 
$20mil per ploddingly dull picture that Roberts gets and Bullock 
doesn't, I just don't see it.  But then again, I'm not the target demo 
for either of these chicks.  Slot-A Roberts could've easily been plugged 
into this Hole-B flick without it missing a beat, and the only 
difference would be that 28 DAYS would've come away with a 
gazillion-dollar first day box office draw.  And I would've slept 
through her version, too.
There was one--count 'em, one--scene in this entire movie that wound up 
surprising me, and that came at the very end; keeping it as spoiler-free 
as I can, I'll just say that it has to do with whom Gwen didn't Walk Off 
Into The Sunset with.  Other than that, 28 DAYS was a pedestrian movie 
about characters I can't be arsed to care about, getting into situations 
that have been covered to hell and back by actors who actually made me 
want to see What Happens Next.  No one here, not even Comic 
Relief/Sensitive Guy Gerhardt, was anywhere near original; other than 
being a pretty bad poster for the Just Say No types, 28 DAYS did nothing 
to earn its keep.
Well, that's not quite true.  Two other bits in this movie actually kept 
my attention during the short time they were given on-screen: the 
often-funny faux soap, "Santa Cruz", was more interesting than the movie 
that surrounded it ("Tiny clusters of brain tumors" will stay with me 
for awhile); and the very funny background P.A. announcements 
("Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?") 
voiced by Betty (Margo Martindale), drew me out of my near-doze.  Pity 
that these bits were lost within a flick unworthy of these moments of 
ingenuity.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
A situation comedy without the laughs, disguised as a drama, that wound 
up a Tragedy.  Made for a good sleeping pill, though.

         Sandra Bullock often comes across onscreen as a slightly more
grown-up version of the girl who was everybody's friend in high school,
the one who always had a smile and some words of wisdom handy whenever
someone needed advice or comfort. That probably has a lot to do with why
her fans show up faithfully, even when her movies are dicey propositions
at best ("Forces of Nature," "Hope Floats," "Practical Magic").
 Director Betty Thomas tries to get Bullock to turn on that old
charm again in "28 Days," in which Bullock plays Gwen, a writer who
spends more time mixing pills and cocktails than working on manuscripts.
But Bullock's not interested in coasting along on her charisma this time
out. Instead, she strains to come across as unbalanced, self-destructive
and defensive; she seems determined to show how much research she's done
on the subject, how much angst she can convey.
The screenplay by Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") insists
Gwen's alcoholism is presented in the sweetest, corniest fashion
possible, however, thereby undercutting everything the actress is
struggling to accomplish. The result is a 12-step misstep.
 Because of the sizable number of romantic comedies she's made,
Bullock has often been compared to Meg Ryan, but if "28 Days" was
supposed to be her answer to Ryan's harrowing alcoholism saga "When a
Man Loves a Woman," it falls short in every category. Ripe with good
intentions and stuffed with bits and pieces ripped out of better films,
"28 Days" is a skin-deep dramedy that skillfully skates around most of
the nastier aspects of addiction. Anyone who's had a drinking problem or
participated in an intervention session will be offended by the offhand
way the movie trivializes the pain that substance abuse causes.
 Gwen may have a tendency to misbehave when she drinks, but
she's still managed to somehow retain both her fresh-faced complexion
and a spacious, funky New York City loft. Even while going through a
series of life-changing crises, Gwen finds time to do her hair and
makeup flawlessly. She may be hitting bottom, folks, but the good news
is she still looks sensational.
 After ruining the wedding of her sister Lily (Elizabeth
Perkins), Gwen lands in Serenity Glen, a rural rehab center where
recovering addicts chant empowering slogans and sing "Lean On Me" and
"Happy Trails To You" in between staging skits, attending silly lectures
(one is called "Are You a Blackout Drunk, Or Don't You Remember?") and
participating in the cutest group therapy sessions you've ever seen.
This might be where the Care Bears go for help if they fall off the
wagon.
 With the exception of the requisite doomed roommate (Azura
Skye), all of Gwen's fellow addicts are cuddly eccentrics, as warm and
transparent as vodka. The movie trudges through all the usual cliches
(Gwen's mom was a lush who drank herself to death, Gwen's counselor is a
recovering cokehead who feels her pain, Gwen's boyfriend is an enabler
who only loves her when she's plastered, etc.) without offering
bothering to freshen them up.
 "If you are young and drink a great deal, it will spoil your
health, slow your mind, make you fat -- in other words, turn you into an
adult," writer P.J. O'Rourke once said. In "28 Days," Bullock does
everything she can to take Gwen to full maturity, but Thomas and Grant
refuse to let her out of the playpen. James Sanford

I'm not sure about you all, but I always seem to relate the words
cutie-patootie to the lovely actress known as Sandra Bullock. Whether it be
in her interviews or her movie roles, the woman just seems to radiate joy,
giddiness and a generally nice aura of someone who doesn't take herself too
seriously. Which is why she is perfect for this role of a woman who is full
of energy and apparent joy, until confronted with the decision to take her
life more seriously or destroy herself and her loving relationships in the
long-run.
PLOT:
A woman with a penchant for the bottle drives a limousine into the side of a
house while intoxicated, and must serve 28 days in a rehabilitation center
or go to jail. Her initial indifference to the place and her issue, land her
into even more trouble, at which point, she must ultimately decide what she
wants out of her own life.
CRITIQUE:
A surprisingly emotional and funny picture, which despite its
road-much-traveled feel, gives us enough interesting characters and a solid
performance from Bullock, to qualify as a solid feel-good dramedy. I don't
recommend you see this film if you're expecting to learn something new about
the process of rehabilitation, drug or alcohol addiction or the
relationships of an addict. But if you don't mind revisiting some of these
tendered themes once more in a film which moves at a quick pace, delivers
tit-for-tat moments of humor and drama, and ultimately gives you every
single 12-step quote needed for anyone to conquer any addiction of life,
then grab a couple of six-packs and check yourself into this moving picture.
Of course, I've never been shy to admit my own enjoyment of "the beverage"
every now and again, but thankfully my even bigger fixation on Internet
porn, hasn't allowed either habit to take over my life completely. But
enough about me. Harumph!
Sandra Bullock really surprised me in this film. Sure, her character is
still pretty cute, does and says cute things, and knows how to party (well,
early on in the movie that is... : ), but this movie allowed Sandra to
demonstrate a little more of her dramatic range, a talent which up until
this film, had personally gone completely unnoticed by moi. Well by golly,
she pulled it off something fierce with several decent scenes featuring a
serious Sandra wallowing in her troubles that be. Of course, much like any
other "institutionalized" movie, the rest of the characters in the film also
needed to create a certain amount of interest, if only enough to pad the
lead performances. The film delivers on that front as well. The stand-out in
the area of humour was definitely the "german gay guy" aka Alan Tyduk, who
had the crowd in stitches every time he uttered, or tried to utter, a word
in this film. Dramatically, Azura Sky took the honors with a touching
portrayal of a girl struggling to overcome her disabling disease, and the
best hair, as usual, went to the great Viggo Mortensen. I suspect that most
fans of Julia Roberts' ERIN BROCKOVICH (7/10) will enjoy this one as well,
seeing as both films feature top-dog actresses at the top of their
respective game, an interesting yet predictable story, and as per usual
Hollywood style, a generally upbeat ending. Of course, this film also has a
lot more humor going for it, but I suppose that's offset by the film's many
serious moments as well.
All in all, you don't have to be a drinker to appreciate this flick, but I
suppose an affection for Sandy Bullock, an understanding of the subject at
hand, and the capacity to embrace a familiar but entertaining theme, should
make this one enjoyable for most anyone fitting that bill. Bottom's up!

In the comedic drama 28 DAYS, Sandra Bullock, as Gwen Cummings, has been
sentenced by a judge to spend the next 28 days in rehab.  After stealing
the limo at her sister's wedding and crashing it into a house, the judge
said it was rehab or jail.  Normally the ultimate party girl, she is
forced to live a life without booze or pills, which to her closely
approximates hell on earth.
Director Betty Thomas (PRIVATE PARTS) and writer Susannah Grant (ERIN
BROCKOVICH) have more affinity for the comedic part of the story, but it
is the tragic that is the most effective.  The comedic, which only works
in fits and spurts, serves more often as a detriment to the movie than
an attribute.
Another problem with the picture is that we've seen it before and
better.  Michael Keaton in CLEAN AND SOBER was funnier and more
chillingly convincing.  And the frighteningly effective performance by
Meg Ryan in WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN put both movies shame.
We get a brief glimpse at the movie's start of how much fun Gwen has
when wasted.  Soon after that we witness her stampede through her
sister's wedding like a drunken bull on a rampage.  "Gwen, you make it
impossible to love you," her sister, Lilly (Elizabeth Perkins), tells
her in disgust at the wedding.
In flashbacks we learn that the two sisters had an alcoholic mother,
with a demeanor much like Gwen's, whom they would shake violently to
wake up when she passed out drunk.  This conflict between the sisters is
the most promising and most underdeveloped part of the storyline.  Their
relationship cries out to us.  We want to know more, especially why
Lilly turned out so apparently normal while Gwen is going down the same
destructive path that their mother followed.
In an inspired bit of casting against type, Steve Buscemi plays Gwen's
counselor.  She blows off his guidance to her ("Remember God never gives
us more than we can handle.") with a tart reply ("Is that available
stitched on a pillow somewhere?").  His effect on her life appears as if
it will be significant, but the movie only gives us a few cheap laughs
before moving on.
Although interrupted periodically by genuine tragedy (puking in the
toilet from drug withdrawal, attempted suicides, ugly relapses, etc.),
the movie spends most of its time and energy in search of laughs.  Alan
Tudyk, for example, plays a gay German stripper with a funny accent.
Most of the comedy troop seem lifted from some lame television sitcom.
Viggo Mortensen plays a cocaine-sniffing major league pitcher who isn't
sure that he'll ever play again.  His addiction for the soap opera
"Santa Cruz" is shared by others in rehab.  He is also addicted to
women, which gets him in trouble with husbands.  Needless to say, he
forms an attachment of sorts to Gwen, much to the consternation of her
boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West).  Jasper, representing the temptations
of the devil, shows up at the clinic periodically to tempt and test Gwen
with offers of drugs and freedom.
Sometimes the movie successfully blends the comedic with the tragic.
"Statistically, only 3 out of 10 make it, so it makes it better for us
if he doesn't make it" one of the addicts says as another leaves to
venture out into the cold world outside the clinic.
When is the scariest and most important time for someone trying to kick
the habit?  After they leave rehab.  After choosing to show that time
for Gwen, the filmmakers made it seem way too easy for her.  All she
needs to do is "just say no."  As simple as that.
28 DAYS runs 1:43.  It is rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements
involving substance abuse, language and some sensuality and would be
acceptable for teenagers.

     Everyone knows that writers are drunks.  I mean, I'm drunk right
now.  I'm surprised I can type, you know, since my hands are shaking so
bad and my vision is so blurry.
     If you're ready to buy in to the writer-as-alcoholic cliché, you
should just love 28 Days, which pulls out every stereotype in the book.
Sandra Bullock stars as Gwen, the aforementioned drunk writer (living,
naturally, in New York City), who ruins her sister's wedding by
insulting her during the toast, falling on the cake, and wrecking the
"just married" car by crashing it into a house!  Off to rehab for her,
where she meets a cast of characters drawn so broadly they could
populate a sitcom on UPN.
     Those also trying to sober up include heroin addict Andrea (TV's
Azura Skye), sex fiend Oliver (TV's Michael O'Malley), and drunk
ex-doctor Daniel (TV's Reni Santoni).  There's the requisite love
interest, drunk baseball pitcher Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), plus the devil
on poor Gwennie's shoulder, boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West), whom she's
left back at home to carouse through the big city while she sobers up.
     Gwen and co. are put through their 12 steps in short order,
hugging, chanting, cleaning, climbing, singing, taking classes, and
bonding with one another over this horrible, horrible disease they all
must learn to deal with.  See Gwen try to charm a horse.  See Gwen's
sister (Elizabeth Perkins) confront her.  See Gwen sob over mother (also
an alky), who died when she was a kid, safely laying the blame off on
someone else.  See audience roll eyes.  Wow, these 28 days really only
feel like 19!
     The whole movie walks a tightrope between farce and melodrama, but
falls liberally into both.  In fact, the only saving graces of the film
come from the caricatures of supporting characters: Steve Buscemi as
Gwen's fallen angel counselor; Alan Tudyk stealing the show as a
flamboyantly gay, vaguely Teutonic basket case.
     Regular readers of filmcritic.com will know that I've never been a
fan of Miss Bullock's work (see also The Net), and her "Golly, I hope I
get an Oscar" performance here doesn't do much to change my opinion.
Director Betty Thomas (The Brady Bunch Movie) is also completely out of
her element.  She even shot six episodes of the faux soap opera "Santa
Cruz" featured as a running gag in the film -- time that might have been
better spent teaching Sandra how to do drama.
     But what am I saying?  I'm just a drunk writer whose only worry is
where his next martini is coming from.  Don't listen to me.  Hey,
bartender!

     How's this for damnation via faint praise: I'm pretty impressed that
28 DAYS didn't turn out to be an utterly unwatchable disaster. There
aren't many film premises that would set off my Early Crap Alert System
like a feel-good comedy-drama about folks in a rehab clinic (maybe Robin
Williams in a feel-good comedy-drama about a robot who wants to be human).
You've got your pathos, you've got your cheap emotion, you've got your
showy drunken scenes for actors and you've got your central character
arc so rigidly defined you could set your watch by when denial turns into
a great big group hug. 
     I've got to hand it to director Betty Thomas for lending 28 DAYS a
little dark edge, and to screenwriter Susannah Grant for delivering a few
more solid laughs than I was expecting. Unfortunately, they're still not
able to overcome the basic flaws in their story. Their protagonist is Gwen
Cummings (Sandra Bullock), a party girl always running just on the edge of
out-of-control with her drinking and pill-popping. She crosses over that
edge when she leaves her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding in a
shambles and crashes a limousine into a house. Gwen finds herself
sentenced to a four week stay at Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center,
where she initially refuses to identify with the other patients. Soon,
however, she realizes she does have a problem, and begins the long, slow
road to sobriety.
     Emphasis on the "long" and "slow." Gwen actually hits bottom
relatively early in 28 DAYS, leaving plenty of time for comic episodes
focusing on Gwen's fellow travellers, including Oliver (Mike O'Malley), a
doughy self-styled ladies' man; Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), a flamboyant gay
man who grows emotional easily; Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), a professional
baseball pitcher; and Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's high-strung, soap opera-
and heroin-addicted roommate. There are more than a few good gags to be
found in the interaction between the support group members, but there's
nothing driving the narrative forward once Gwen decides to go straight.
It's not that the process of recovery ends with one decision, of course.
In 28 DAYS, however, the process of drama does end with that one
descision, leaving the film to grab at relationships and confrontations
that never go anywhere.
     Those moments might have seemed more vital if not for the uninspired
performance by Sandra Bullock. It feels like I've been a Bullock booster
long after most others have leapt from her feisty-cute bandwagon, but
there's little going on behind her attitude in 28 DAYS. Flashback segments
show Gwen and her sister dealing with their alcoholic single mother,
scenes that should add resonance to Gwen's struggle for sobriety. But
there's never any urgency to Gwen's struggle with addiction -- she never
slips once she admits she's an alcoholic, and she becomes one of her
group's "strong ones" too quickly. At least her post-sobriety scenes are a
reprieve from her cartoon rendition of staggering drunkenness. In this
role, Bullock looks like she's completely out of her depth.
     Then again, depth doesn't really appear to be a priority in 28 DAYS. 
Betty Thomas does do a nice job with altered perspectives, shooting hazy
memories in grainy video and capturing some funny confessional scenes with
an I'm-the-center-of-the-world iris effect. There is the small problem
that those confessionals don't really belong in 28 DAYS, but there's no
solid sense of what belongs throughout the story. It becomes frustrating
to realize that Gwen's relationship with her equally party-time boyfriend
Jasper (Dominic West) is going to be central to the plot, rather than her
relationship with her straight-arrow sister. The fragmentation of family,
the different paths taken by two adult children of an alcoholic and the
challenges of forgiveness could have made for a much more compelling
sub-text than a half-hearted romantic triangle with Eddie at the other
vertex. Instead, 28 DAYS tosses the sisters a couple of token scenes
before retreating to the safe comedy of Gwen's personal cuckoo's nest. 28
DAYS offers some effective comedy, and it does manage to avoid pathos and
cheap emotion. In fact, with its fragmented narrative and limp lead
performance, it comes close to avoiding emotion altogether.

"28 Days" would like to be an honest portrayal of a person attempting to 
rehabilitate from an alcoholic pill-popper to someone who is able to live a 
normal life, but it simply isn't. With themes similar to that of 1988's 
"Clean and Sober" and 1994's "When a Man Loves a Woman" (with a remarkable 
performance by Meg Ryan), "28 Days" is the black sheep of the trio--a sketchy 
and predictable dramedy with little insight or intelligence, and a story 
outline that is merely skin-deep. Welcome to planet Hollywood!
For the past fifteen years, Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) has lived her life 
in the fast lane, speeding along from one drink and pill, from one party and 
bedroom romp, to the next, without any clear destination as to where her life 
is headed. After yet another round of late-night partying, Gwen awakens with 
her equally troubled boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) only to realize that it 
is the wedding day of her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins), and she is 
already late. Making a scene at the reception (where she arrives drunk), Gwen 
accidentally falls into the wedding cake and, following a car accident in 
which she drives into a home while trying to find a cake store, is 
immediately sent to Serenity Glen Rehab Center, where she is to serve 28 
days. 
At first, Gwen refuses to admit she even has a problem, and finds it 
difficult to believe she is like her fellow drug patients, including her 
teenaged, heroin-and-soap-opera-addicted roommate, Andrea (Azura Skye); a 
divorced mother (Marianne Jean-Baptiste); and a light-hearted gay dancer 
(Alan Tudyk). But the more difficulty she has sustaining an abruptly sober 
life, and the more she flashes back to her childhood when she was living with 
her now-deceased alcoholic mother, Gwen realizes the discouraging footsteps 
in which she has followed thus far in her adult life. It's time to set things 
straight, for once, she believes, and that includes getting off drugs, 
mending her rocky relationship with her sister, and dealing maturely with her 
boyfriend, whom she cares about but knows is not the best influence for her.
Written by Susannah Grant, the mastermind also behind this season's biggest 
hit, "Erin Brockovich," "28 Days" is a sloppily made motion picture with nary 
the depth nor the realism to be a truly powerful or even memorable 
experience. Quickly moving from one scene to the next, none of the supporting 
characters are given the space or time to break free of their one-note, 
stereotypical roles, while the workings of the plot fail to overcome its 
cliches. 
Meanwhile, Sandra Bullock remains in the forefront from the first scene to 
the last, and she is her usual good self, but in a decidedly less glamorous 
role this time, respectively. Bullock injects the flawed Gwen as a likable 
character, even when she is being reckless, since we realize that she is a 
woman with a great deal of problems, both exterior and interior, that 
decisively need to be worked out.
Surrounding Bullock are a parade of stock characters, with only Elizabeth 
Perkins, as Bullock's fed-up sister, and Azura Skye, as Bullock's troubled 
roommate, particularly standing out in effective performances that are given 
more than a few fleeting moments of screen time. Late in the picture, hints 
of a romance are brought up involving Gwen and a new patient, the ruggedly 
handsome alcoholic baseball player Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), but there is 
little chemistry between the two, and even less interest in them within 
Grant's oversimplified screenplay, which basically disregards the subplot 
before the silly conclusion.
"28 Days" may be a so-called "feel-good" comedy-drama, but it is rarely 
funny, and its emotions, which thankfully never go overboard in the schmaltz 
department, nevertheless neglect to exude much tangible feeling. Alcoholism 
and drug abuse are serious diseases that are never solved or overcame; 
instead, they are life-long battles that rely on willpower and the amount of 
desire a person has to stay clean. The recovery process, as delineated here, 
is a relatively easy and sugarcoated one, at a loss for any signs of 
authenticity. The final minutes of "28 Days" particularly fail to do this 
idea legitimate justice, as we are led to believe Gwen has, once and for all, 
gotten her priorities in order, and will never go back to drinking. Maybe she 
will, and maybe she won't; who knows? Sigh...if only the big L (as in 
L-I-F-E) was really so simple.

I tried, I really did. I wanted to feel Sandra's pain. I wanted to be moved,
and cry with all the others flanking me in that theatre, but instead, I found
myself laughing. I laughed loud and with much derision, I'm ashamed to say. I
laughed at the obligatory death scene, the emotional talk between sisters ("I
should have helped you with your homework!"), the drunken mother flashbacks
(oh, so this how our main character ended up like this), and most of all I
laughed at the dopey ending which I won't describe for those saps who choose to
ignore my cautionary review (you know who you are). I left the theatre
un-moved, but all that laughter did me good. Maybe I was just in a weird mood.
28 DAYS is not a movie I planned to see ever, save for maybe when it would
inevitably pop up on pay cable where I catch most of the movies I never plan on
seeing (think 8MM, THE CORRUPTER, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLEâŚthink, but don't see).
It came with a trailer that made me gag, and starred Sandra Bullock who seems
utterly incapable of choosing a good script. It's directed by Betty Thomas, who
managed to make Howard Stern likeable in PRIVATE PARTS, but then again, it's
directed by Betty Thomas, the woman who turned DR.DOLITLE into a two hour potty
joke (or so I've heard, I could never actually bring myself to sit through yet
another supposed Eddie Murphy comeback). Steve Buscemi (who's been MIA ever
since he graced the otherwise execrable ARMAGEDDON) is featured prominently in
the trailer. I like him a lot. Viggo Mortensen is also in the film, though he's
advertised a bit less prominently. Mortensen may be the most talented leading
man who has yet to become a leading man. And it was written by Susannah Grant
who wrote the cheeky crowd pleaser, ERIN BROCKOVICH.
So, I didn't really want to go, but I was curious (it was this same curiosity
that got me into trouble when SHOWGIRLS frolicked into town--curiosity may have
killed that damn cat, but in my case, all it ever did was get me to pay good
money to see bad movies), and when it received glowing reviews from two critics
I regularly pay attention to (Roger Ebert and Owen Gleiberman for those
curious) I decided to push my doubts aside, and give Sandra and Betty another
chance.
I'm not really sorry that I did. I feel rather indifferent about the whole
debacle. It's an improvement over FORCES OF NATURE and HOPE FLOATS (two films I
caught on HBO, and just had to turn off because they stunk so badly), but it's
not really, you know, good. The script is like a LIFETIME weepie, which is to
say that it's well made for a made for TV flick that would air on that
particular channel. It isn't, however, well made enough to shell out seven
bucks to see. (Or more, if you happen to be unlucky enough to live in New York,
a city where not only the mosquitoes are poisonous, but the movies are eight
whopping bucks and going higher I hear).
In my review of Grant's other movie, ERIN BROCKOVICH (which she provided the
screenplay for), I noted that without the star power of Julia Roberts and the
clever Steven Soderbergh at the helm, it would be little more than a passable
TV movie. Judging from 28 DAYS, it appears as if Grant is only capable of
writing scripts for TV movies (though I certainly wouldn't mind it if she
proved me wrong one of these days), so I plead to any LIFETIME execs that may
be reading this: please hire this women! Either that or pair her up with a
director as bright as Soderbergh. Not that Betty Thomas is horrible, she just
isn't distinctive. Which is to say her films are indistinguishable from the
rest of the mainstream crap currently stinking up a multiplex near you. Which
maybe does mean she's horrible.
While this flick's noxious trailer would have you believe that it's a comedy
with hints of drama, there are very few laughs, and plenty of scenes designed
to make you ball like Haley Joe Osmet after the little pisher was denied a
Golden Globe. 28 DAYS is a very mainstream melodrama about the out of control
Gwen (perky Sandra Bullock acting as petulant as she can), an alcoholic who
shimmies into her sisters wedding drunk, then causes huge amounts of
faux-drama, all while her smarmy British boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West)
chortles about. Our bitter heroine must either go to jail or a rehab clinic.
Which would you pick? Well if you saw this clinic you might just want to be
thrown in jail. It's the kind of rehab where people sing and interact with farm
animals. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway for the sake of
completion) that at first Gwen is very opposed to all this goofiness, then she
eventually warms up to it, and everything most likely ends happily. Trust me, I
haven't given a thing away.
The drama of alcoholism is presented with some reality, but never to the point
where we really become involved in the suffering of it all. Sure we see Bullock
scrunch up her nose in pain and all that but we never feel it, and personally I
didn't care to. Bullock has made a career out of playing sweet, airy
girly-woman, like your bestest pal in the whole world, who just happens to be
really hot. She has a freeness about her, a sunshine quality that doesn't seem
faked (as, at least for me, it does with Gwyneth Paltrow). Here she is stripped
of all that, and her characterization is adequate, but something is missing.
She doesn't seem comfortable when she drops the nice-girlness, and I admire her
for trying, but this is really a role better suited for someone like Janeane
Garofalo, who seems just as bitter as this character requires. (I felt the same
thing, only the opposite with Garofalo attempting to play sweet in THE
MATCHMAKER).
Viggo Mortension is the sometimes-love interest, a rehabee, with a penchant for
unwanted paternity suites. The actor plays the part in a laid back Mathew
McConaughey drawl, and makes the most of his nothing-role. Busemi is featured
in about three scenes the entire movie, yet he registers more than Bullock did
for me. He plays a drug counselor (ex-junkie and alcoholic) with a gentle,
quite intelligence. He looks at Bullock with sad, helpful eyes, and we get the
feeling that this guy really cares. Others present are third-tier character
actors, all equipped with their one identifiable character trait. They're an
overly wacky bunch, just the kind of rehab people you'd expect to find in a
film by the director of DR. DOLITTLE. One of those quirky souls is Andrea
(played by sitcom star Azura Skye), a morose addict whose fate seems obligatory
in a movie such as this.
Thomas directs in hand held camera mode as if to announce that she's attempting
something grittier than the average Bullock vehicle, but all that grit just
paves the way for more cheap pathos. In retrospect I realize it's mighty
telling that in Roger Ebert's review he notes: "28 Days is rated PG-13 and
might be effective as a cautionary tale for teens". In a sense, that is a lot
of what's wrong with the film, it's too damn cautionary. The movie is like an
overly moral tale that an ex-rehab clinic might tell to his grand children.
It's too damn safe. Even the grittiness eventually leads to saccharine lessons.

IN SHORT: For once, a Bullock flick I didn't like. . .
Even while going through the alcoholic/pill-popper withdrawal that
occurs early on in 28 Days, the closest thing to a "heavy" flick Sandra
Bullock has done in the last few years, try as she might Bullock just
can't look bad. And while you might assume that, since the premise is
party-girl-in-forced-rehab, this flick is one bit of bad news after
another, you'd be wrong. It's not a giggle a minute,
let's-make-fun-of-the-addicts, laugh-fest either, though there is a
helluva lot more humor in the piece than you would expect. Once again,
we point the finger at director Betty Thomas who has, since moving up to
the movie director's chair after many years as a teevee actor on an
"obscure" show called Hill Street Blues), taken material that we all
thought was impossible to bring to the big screen (last time out with
Howard Stern's Private Parts) and made the impossible happen. A fistful
of talent and the earnest endeavors of her cast almost do it again.
Almost.
That's about as close to a rave as you're gonna get from me, 'cuz over
all this is one of those situations where good intentions fall flat and
we get just an OK movie.
Gwen Cummings (Bullock) is the party girl. She likes The Clash, beer (or
anything else suitably alcoholic to wash down the Vicodan pills she
pops) and night long sloppy sex with boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West).
Not necessarily in that order. When a nightmare hangover pushes Gwen to
reup the stupor levels, she ruins her sister Lily's wedding and in short
order trashes a wedding cake, a limousine, and a suburban home (complete
with ornamental lawn jockey, so un-PC these days, on its front lawn).
Given the choice of jail time or 28 days in rehab, Gwen chooses door
number two. . .
.. . . and is welcomed with open arms to Serenity Glen, a lovely oasis of
tranquility and positive affirmation out in the country. Here, Lawrence
Welk blares from the public address system, Bill Wither's "Lean on Me"
is transformed into a life enhancing chant and your first day includes a
full search of your possessions and confiscation of any cell phone,
coke, booze, pills, heroin, pot, syringes or glass objects (heck, if you
had to chant "Lean On Me" a dozen times a day, you'd wanna slash your
wrists, too!) that you'd try to sneak in.
Cigarettes are fine, though. Virtually all the characters smoke like
fiends. That may be the way it is in real life but that little
inconsistency is like a stone stuck in your shoe that you can't shake
out. It's always calling attention to itself. Onwards...
While the flick is filled with characters whose backgrounds are colorful
and just well developed enough that they're not stereotypes -- Gwen's 17
year old junkie roommate Andrea (Azura Skye), a famous baseball player
(Viggo Mortensen), a gay German guy (Alan Tudyk) whose problem even I
couldn't figure out -- Gwen must battle the question of whether to dump
her enabler (that would be Jasper) who willingly smuggles in booze and
pills (One at Gwen's request. The other as an attempt to lure her back
to the Dark Side) or shovel horsepoop with a smiling face (it's
therapeutic) for a month and then get back to "normal".
As proof that there is life after rehabilitation, we get to meet
Counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi). Buscemi's casting alone is such a
stroke of genius that I can only report that the sum of the parts is not
greater than the whole. Nor is it a total disaster. The plus is that the
flick doesn't resort to stereotypes for a cheap laugh. The minus is that
I didn't care even a whit for Bullock's Gwen.
That lack of sympathy doesn't come from my own baggage, which I've
always laid those out so you can decide if I've tinted the picture: I'm
virulently anti-drunk driving, having lost a dear friend to one. On the
flip side I go through a self-imposed detox every three months off the
addictive medications that keep me alive. Personally, I think one
offsets the other and now you know.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to 28 Days, he would have paid...
Pay per view level. As much as I adore Sandra Bullock (yeah, I do), I
didn't adore 28 Days.

A change of pace for comedic director Betty Thomas, 28 Days is a wholly
predictable story of a booze-and-pill addict that learns how to overcome
her problems after spending some court-ordered time at a rehabilitation
center.  Aside from a few interesting camera tricks, there's nothing
here that you haven't already seen a dozen times.  The big drawing card
here is supposed to be Sandra Bullock, but she hasn't exactly been
lighting the show business world on fire lately.  Most people consider
her a top-shelf, A-list Hollywood star, but she's only had three
bona-fide hits (Speed, While You Were Sleeping and A Time to Kill) and
those films are all over five years old.
Bullock (Forces of Nature) stars as Gwen Cummings, who we learn is an
out-of-control partier via Days' first scene.  The Clash's `Should I
Stay Or Should I Go' blares over a frenzy of slow-mo and sped-up film as
Gwen and her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West, William Shakespeare's A
Midsummer Night's Dream) pound drinks, dance and pass out on the eve of
her sister Lilly's (Elizabeth Perkins, Crazy in Alabama) wedding.  The
next day, Gwen and Jasper are late to the nuptials and trash the
reception before Gwen steals a limousine, loses control and crashes into
a lovely Bedford, New York home.
Days immediately hops forward in time, where Gwen is being dropped off
at a rehabilitation center called Serenity Glen, where she has been
ordered to spend four weeks in lieu of serving any jail time.  Sounds
like a pretty light sentence to me.  Of course, Gwen plans on coasting
through her court-ordered time at the Glen, but predictably begins to
bond with the other addicts once the waves of withdrawal begin to set
in.  We learn from Gwen's flashbacks that she inherited alcoholism from
her mom, who taught her young daughters that having fun was the most
important thing in life because `If you're not having fun, what's the
friggin' point?'
Serenity Glen is packed full of stock characters, including the old
woman (Diane Ladd, Primary Colors), the middle-aged man (Thomas regular
Reni Santoni, `Poppy' from Seinfeld), the black girl (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste, Secrets & Lies), the teenaged girl (Azura Skye, Zoey,
Duncan, Jack & Jane), the gay guy (Alan Tudyk, Patch Adams) and the
smart-mouth that tries to get in Gwen's pants (Mike O'Malley, ESPN's
`The Rick').  And what's with Jake from Melrose Place landing the big
role of the hunky heartthrob for whom Gwen falls?  Oh, wait  it's only
Viggo Mortensen (A Walk on the Moon).  Speaking of odd casting, Tudyk's
character reeks of fellow effeminate, blond stringbean Andy Dick. Maybe
Dick was supposed to be in the film but backed out because of real-life
rehab.
Days also features this odd guy (Loudon Wainwright III) playing a guitar
like a Greek chorus (a la Jonathan Richman in There's Something About
Mary), but then he disappeared until the ending.  There was also an
inappropriate amount of time spent on a fictional soap opera that the
Serenity Glen inmates watched.  But the biggest problem of all is
Bullock's character.  Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?  What about
the guy that owned the limo that she stole and crashed?  Or the people
that owned the house she ruined?
Thomas' (Doctor Dolittle, Private Parts) direction is the only thing
that keeps Days afloat.  Together with cinematographer Declan Quinn
(Flawless), Thomas creates several memorable scenes where Gwen flashes
back to either her drunk mother or wild drug-and-liquor parties, which
result in the character turning on all of the faucets in the bathroom to
drown out the sounds of her past.  Like most of her previous work,
Thomas also uses a handheld camera to shoot some of the `group' scenes,
which lends a nice fly-on-the-wall feel to the film.
Days' linear script was written Susannah Grant, who penned the equally
conventional (but much more enjoyable) Erin Brockovich.  It's your basic
story about a person that needs help but refuses it before finally
accepting it, overcoming their problem, and then moving on with their
life.  The plot offers nothing that you wouldn't expect and, at times,
the film seems like it should be on the Lifetime network, or possibly a
TV movie of the week, which is where Bullock seems to be headed.  Of
other note, the `F' word was noticeably removed from at least one scene
to preserve the PG-13 rating.  Like there's going to be a bunch of kids
between thirteen and sixteen clamoring to see this.

"Alcohol and drugs = bad. Not alcohol and drugs = good. Got it?" 
Just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing
with their personal problems on screen, be that insanity or
alcoholism, Hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep,
emotional stories about finding yourself'..
'28 Days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful'
true stories that people are so proudly retelling at
AA-meetings. Gwennie (Sandra Bullock) is a young woman who drowned her
problems in alcohol. For her life was a big party, with no beginning
and no end. This behavior has of course estranged her from her only
sister and from life itself. Her existence is filled with endless
parties and comic episodes. Such as when she got drunk with boyfriend
Jasper (Dominic West), borrowed her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins )
wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house. This time she had to
pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab. Here she must realize
that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption, willpower
and commitment. Most important she must realize her place and
direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big
party.
The film itself feels like a rehab program, whining and moaning about
things that have been said and written a million times. It is a
classic cautionary tale. An echo. A big, fat and expensive cliché. A
shadow of last year's 'Girl, Interrupted', which likewise followed in
the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'The Cuckoo's Nest' and
'Trainspotting'. Director Betty Thomas has stuffed her film with so
many failures and errors, that it is impossible to sum them all up in
one review. For some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a
drama/comedy. Jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude
you from the really important and complex issues: alienation, despair,
terror, confusion, loneliness. And what awesome power and strength of
character it actually takes to overcome all that and become
clean. Isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first
place? Even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the
park. Betty Thomas' idea of hell is a cozy, homey place where happy
alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke, drink
or watch TV after 11. It is simply too light, simplified and
unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously. But the worst thing about it
is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of
significance. That it actually tries to educate the audience with its
extremely predictable and primitive story. "All you need to do is just
say no", says Dr.Cornell (Steve Buscemi) as if was the revelation of
the century. And that's how simple it is! In fact I would rather watch
'Lost in Space' once again, than return to '28 Days' .
As for acting, it's acceptable, but hardly anything else. For Sandra
Bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more
than 'Speed'. She handles her part with a surprising professionalism
and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete
flop. Dominic West shines as the source of Gwenie's devilish
temptations, but Elizabeth Perkins' and Steve Buscemi's great talents
are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters. Although
intellectually 'Girl, Interrupted' was a greater achievement, '28
Days' is superior in its visual aspect. There are some nice flash back
sequences and occasionally impressive pacing, but the overall
technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor. The most
important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot
better. 'Clean and Sober', 'Only When I Laugh', 'When A Man Loves A
Woman' , 'Leaving Las Vegas' and many other stronger films were made
about the same issues. So what's the point? In other words '28 Days'
doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level. If you're
caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and
you're standing in front of the movie theatre, you might as well go in
and watch '28 Days' . Under all other circumstances stay away, because
this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost.

28 DAYS [Thomas] -- Solid, well-balanced dramedy has more than its share
of melodrama, but Bullock makes it work, even so much that two scenes in
particular had me in tears. No, not the boo-hooing of teenage girls
sitting through Titanic, mind you, just a bit teary-eyed. B

        In preparing for my review of "28 Days," Sandra Bullock's new
melodrama, I gatecrashed an AA meeting at which a young woman, probably not
much older than Bullock's character, spoke for thirty minutes about her
struggle with alcoholism.  What this woman had to say or, perhaps equally
importantly, the way in which she told her story, was absolutely
fascinating.  It was like watching Spalding Gray doing his "Swimming to
Cambodia" thing.  She kept going for thirty minutes straight with barely a
pause.  Her monologue was loaded with humor, pathos, and poignancy.  It was
filled with harsh truths, anguish, pain and suffering, yet is was somehow
delightful.  It was the kind of speech I wish I could have captured on
videotape to replay over and over again to savor every heartfelt moment,
every aspiration, every moving detail.  "28 Days" is not like this.  It's a
well-meaning film about what it's like to have a Bud with your daily
Wheaties but it's strictly AA Lite.  Bullock plays a party girl who, after
taking out a lawn jockey and crashing a limo into someone's porch during
her sister's wedding, is sentenced to 28 days of detox in a rehab clinic.
Here she gets with the program with a bunch of thinly-written caricatures
of drug and alcohol abusers, many of whom are played by miscast performers
(including Steve Buscemi as her counselor and Viggo Mortensen as a
pro-baseball player with a love for the soaps).  Bullock's character spends
more time trying the break the rules than trying to quit drinking and as a
result her month-end turnabout seems hurried and implausible.  There have
been some fine movies about alcoholism ("The Lost Weekend") and there have
been some not-so-fine movies about alcoholism ("Leaving Las Vegas").  "28
Days," alas, comes closer to the latter.  Bullock is good, and her
relationship with her sister--played by Elizabeth Perkins--is excellent,
but "28 Days" is still about 26 days shy of sobriety.
