This is another of those Spanish films that is really surreal, and off the
wall, and we watch it trying to make anything we can out of nothing.  This
is not a film for those looking for MEANINGS.  It is a fun, black satire at
times, full of unusual things, and surprises.
Both Spain, France and Italy are full of Don Juan stories, the famous man
who spent his time making it with as many women as he could.  His reputation
preceeded him, and women were always ready to take him on.  And there are a
few legends relating to him, and Casanova, which still live here and there.
One of them, is that on the day of Don Juan's death, he comes to life for
the evening to pick up a few more women to his endless list.
And this movie mixes a theatrical production of Don Juan with reality.  The
real Don Juan comes out of his grave ( naked ) and goes carousing.  And the
actor who is playing him, also tries, but he is a gay buffoon, that most
women don't like.  Amidst the mess they change places, and end up in the
weirdest of places, doing the weirdest things.  And Don Juan does get
another score, and so does the actor when some women do not know any better,
and the film keeps getting more surrealistic as it goes on.  The sequence of
street scenes, the changing of actors, the reversal of personalities ( a
dual role for the main actor ) gets highly complicated and lots of
fun.
Although I knew nothing of this film, and expected likewise, I did find
myself laughing several times.  The predicament of each character does
create a very funny situation.  And the film plays it up as much as it can.
