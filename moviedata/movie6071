Somewhere between hardcore and softcore pornography lies  well, Lies, a
bold, button-pushing film from Jang Sun Woo, the reigning bad boy of
Korean cinema.  His latest is about the sadomasochistic relationship
between a high school virgin and her older lover.  The film is based on
Jung-Il Chang's novel (adapted by Jang), which has been banned in Korea.
Lies would have been creepy enough left to its own devices, but Jang
uses a bunch of interesting cinematic techniques to make the film look
and feel like a documentary about defiling a naďve girl.  Both principal
actors are making their screen debuts, and their characters are only
known by their first initials.  Lies contains documentary-style
interviews with both actors, and each provides narration throughout
portions of the film.
Tae Yeon Kim plays Y, an 18-year-old high school virgin who wants to get
laid before her graduation.  Through her best friend Woori (Hye Jin
Jeon), she is introduced to a 38-year-old artist named J (Sang Hyun
Lee).  Woori is in love with J and his art, but she's too embarrassed to
make advances toward the married sculptor.  Instead, Woori makes her
friend call J, and she finds herself living vicariously through the
colorful acts of phone sex that Y has with J.
Y and J eventually agree to meet in person, and the two perform every
carnal act imaginable.  Lies pulls no punches here, showing it all as Y
is violated in every orifice.  Jang even uses some clever title cards to
announce which cavity J is about to fill (`The First Hole,' `The Second
Hole,' and so forth).
The dialogue isn't any less crass than the visuals.  J rudely
announces,  `I'm going in,' before invading one of Y's nooks.  When he's
trying to get her backside to loosen up, he advises her to `think of my
dick as shit  that'll make it easier.'  He also paws at her private
parts like a monkey looking for bugs.
Strangely, Y seems game for everything, cooing, `I like anything that J
does' to the enraptured Woori.  When J introduces beatings to their
sexual routine, she still doesn't freak out, claiming, `My ass is
killing me, but this is great!'  The whippings increase in severity, and
it isn't long before Y's brother (Kwon Taek Han) begins to get
suspicious about her sister's violent older lover.
Lies is disturbing cinema at either its best or worst form, depending on
where you stand on the issue of perversity in modern cinema.  It's great
that Jang was able to produce such an unflinching look at the bizarre
sexual relationship between two obviously unstable people, but other
than raising both eyebrows and trousers, I'm not too sure what his point
was.

   A better title for this picture would be "lays," or perhaps if
there were not simply two principals in the cast, how about
"Kim Does Korea"?  "Lies" was easily the most pornographic
picture shown at the Toronto Film Festival, a movie that
according to reports prompted more walkouts than any other
in recent memory.  I'm thinking now of what U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said when, during the first trip to
North Korea by a top American official since 1950 she called
the heavily pro-communist show to which she was invited
"embarrassing."  Just think of the good lady's chagrin
were she to leave Pyongyang for Seoul only to be invited to
"Lies"!  This might send her scurrying back to the more
puritanical folks up north.
   Director Jang Sun Woo is sometimes called the bad boy of
South Korean cinema because he likes to shake up the
conservative society of that country  His films have
included "The Road to the Racetrack" about modern
relationships (with strong sexual references), though this time
around he emphasizes sex over relationships.  If Darren
Aronosfky's "Requiem for a Dream" is the most recent movie
about the dangers of drug addiction and Billy Wilder's 1945
work "The Lost Weekend" the classic, unrelenting tale of the
perils of alcohol addiction, then Jang's current film might be
designated a warning about the hazards of an addiction to
sex.  Huh, you say?  There's something wrong about being a
devotee of endless rounds of sex?  Yes, indeed, if you follow
the trajectory of "Lies," which begins in a joyful enumeration
of the sexual acrobatics of a razor-thin duo, the 18-year-old
"Y" (played by Kim Tae Yeon, a fashion model for the past
four years) and her 38-year-old paramour, "J" (played by Lee
Sang Hyan, who is a sculptor in real life as he is in this
story).  In fact, this movie gives new meaning to the acting
term "played by."
   In an interview, director Jang revealed that the novel from
which his movie was taken had a very complicated structure
and that he set out to simplify it by discarding most of the
backgorund detail and dialogue.  He sure did, because what
remains has been cut to the bone (so to speak) with the more
engaging aspect (surprisingly enough) the scenes that take
place outside the bedrooms of the love hotels--popular
buildings in South Korea that rent rooms by the hour.
   The tale centers on the growing relationship between Y, an
18-year-old determined by lose her virginity before
graduation, who hooks up with a bespectacled professional
man twenty years her senior, J, whose wife is alone in Paris
pursuing her own vocation.  After the deed is done (shown
graphically, as are all future gymnastics) they begin to
indulge most pleasurably in S&M.  J beats the ecstatic Y, at
first with a simple whip, progressing to more sophisticated
switches which he carries around in a large suitcase. 
Ultimately they will change roles, with J demanding to be
beaten by the at first reluctant Y, who soon takes as much
pleasure in sadism as she did in masochism.  (I was waiting
for the two to have an argument which would result in the
masochistic Y's mewing, "Whip me, oh, please whip me," to
which the sadistic J would respond, "No...I will not," but this
dialogue, an in-joke in the U.S., never took off).
   Full frontal nudity by both parties would please critics of
Hollywood movies who complain that American males are
never shown in that way, but after, oh, about 40 minutes into
the movie, what becomes embarrassing is not the sexual
performances but the redunancies.  The film seems to be
going nowhere, the plot thickening only when the characters
graduate from one sort of whip to a more sophisticated type. 
Although the actors had not known each other before they
were surreptitiously cast (Jang had to watch out for the
Korean censors and could not advertise openly for his
performers), they display convincing chemistry for each other
and, in fact, reports are that they grew to like each other
quite a bit after their non-stop romps in the sack.  At last
report, however, though they had each other on the ropes,
they did not get to tie the knot.  Some of the limited concern
an audience might find in the picture is in the photographic
effects of cinematographer Kim Woo Hyung, but "Lies" is of
interest mainly in the way the Korean society reacted to both
the novel and the movie, as pornography in any form is illegal
in Korea. Jang Jung II who wrote "Tell Me A Lie" was
sentenced to six months in jail for writing the book, two
months of his sentence amid cries of liberals for erasing all
charges.  
  Jang Sun Woo defends his work as art in that he calls the
movie a spit-in-the-face of Korea's emphasis on working hard
and living a clean life.  "Let's just play.  After all, it's all a
game."  Ultimately, though, "Lies" is a game that goes into
too many extra innings.  Despite the high scoring with bats
and similar tools of the trade (this is pretty much the opposite
of a no-hitter) "Lies" is as resonant as a trip to the
gynecologist.
