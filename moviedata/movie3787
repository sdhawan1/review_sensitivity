     If it was director Darren Aronofsky's goal to use REQUIEM FOR A DREAM
as a variation on A CLOCKWORK ORANGE's Ludivico treatment ... well,
mission accomplished. His adaptation of Huber Selby, Jr.'s novel is a
dazzling multi-media assault, a tale of degradation and shattered lives
that will make you feel as though you need a brain enema to cleanse your
memory of its most disturbing images. Aronofsky's singularly inventive
visual style, combined with one of the year's most chillingly evocative
scores by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, dares you not to look
away, lest you miss something potentially extraordinary. REQUIEM FOR A
DREAM is arresting, compelling and frequently flat-out horrifying.
     So why isn't it one of the best films of the year, if not _the_ best
film? Because for all of Aronofsky's stylistic prowess, and all the film's
visceral power, this narrative falls into an all-too-common trap: It
spells out too much of the subtext, and doesn't trust the viewer to get
the point without a good-old fashioned bludgeoning. The story focuses on
four characters in search of an exit in Brooklyn. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen
Burstyn) is a widow who spends her days eating chocolates and watching
info-mercials in her Coney Island apartment. Her only son Harry (Jared
Leto) is a heroin addict who keeps pawning Sara's television to fix
himself, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best pal Tyrone
(Marlon Wayans). Harry and company have a plan to become independent by
going into the dealing business themselves, a plan they think will make
all their dreams come true. Sara, meanwhile, may have a chance to fulfill
her own dream of being a contestant on a TV game show, but first she'll
have to lose a lot of weight to get into her favorite red dress -- even if
that means taking a few habit-forming diet pills.
     During the portion of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM when these characters still
have hope that their dreams may come true, it's a dynamic film experience.
Aronofsky eschews the typical fetishistic shots of injections,
substituting rapid-fire montages to represent the characters' respective
fixes. He gets inside the highs and lows, sometimes with sound (a
depressant turning words from the television into a gradually slowing
record), sometimes with images (a fish-eye lens distorting Sara into a
startling grotesquerie). There are brilliant moments both when the film is
at its most kinetic (Sara's speed-fuelled cleaning jags) and at its most
serene (Harry and Marion sharing a tender split-screen moment in which
their physical connection is disturbingly disjointed). As he demonstrated
in 1998's PI, Aronofsky is one of the few true visionaries making American
movies.
     There's style to spare in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but there's not as
much substance as there should be, and what substance there is becomes too
blatant in its presentation. Early in the film, an intriguing theme
develops as we see Sara indulge in her sweets and self-help TV: Even as
she frets over Harry's addiction, it's clear she seeks some mood-altering
quick fixes of her own. But Aronofsky spells it out when he has Harry
note, "What's mom's fix? Television!" Similarly, a subtle moment in which
Sara is given a preferred seat among the women outside her building --
just because she may be on television in the near future -- is underlined
by Sara's comment on her royal treatment. Every time REQUIEM FOR A DREAM
is on the verge of being about more than its characters' inevitable spiral
into agony, it quickly offers the Cliff's Notes version and moves you
along to the next moment of personal hell.
     And eventually, all those moments of personal hell become wearying.
As splendidly acted as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is -- and every one of the four
principals is very good, particularly Burstyn -- it's ultimately a film
that pays far more attention to the things drugs does to these people than
what it takes away from them. It becomes such a relentless parade of
dignity-destroying acts and physical disintegration that the broadly
sketched characterizations vanish in the wake of their misery. It
conditions you to feel repulsed by what drugs do to these people without
allowing you to feel for them as people. This is spectacularly staged and
marvelously performed "Just Say No" melodrama -- REEFER MADNESS for the
art house set. It's impossible not to get REQUIEM FOR A DREAM's message,
and nearly impossible not to applaud the messenger. But after 102 minutes,
it feels like you've been strapped into a chair while the message imbeds
itself into your pried-open eyeballs.

_Requiem_for_a_Dream_ **** (out of ****)
Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is less a film than a journey,
a torturously exhausting one at that--and in this case, that's the
highest compliment that can be paid.  In his visionary adaptation of
Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel, Aronofsky doesn't merely make one bear witness
to four characters' harrowing descents into drug addiction; he forces one
to experience their euphoric highs and, above else, their shattering
lows.  This is, as Aronofsky himself calls it, a horror film--one that
not only shocks, but scars.
Set in New York, _Requiem_ follows two parallel storylines whose
foundations are different but ultimately become more or less the same. 
One follows a trio of young people: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his
girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone
(Marlon Wayans).  Marion's goal in life is to become a fashion designer,
and in order to finance the opening of a boutique, Harry and Tyrone
become drug dealers--which intensifies their already strong habit. 
Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), after receiving a notice
that she could appear on a TV game show, goes to dangerous lengths to
lose weight, namely a steadily increasing intake of diet pills.
The narrative line is obvious as the film passes through the seasons: a
sunny summer, an aptly named fall, and an even bleaker winter.  But this
isn't a film about the story so much it is about feeling.  Aronofsky
proved he can effectively unsettle viewers with his award-winning debut
_pi_, and he takes his ability to the next level in _Requiem_.  Much has
been made about the vast number of cuts in the film, but these are no
superficial exercises in style; they immerse the viewer in the
perspective and mindset of the characters.  The hyperactive early stages
of their addictions are especially captured well, and a split screen
device that could've come off as overkill reinforces the subjective point
of the view of the film.  The sensory barrage also slyly sidesteps the
explicit while ironically intensifying the feeling.  For all the shooting
up, snorting, and pill popping that occurs in the film, rarely are the
acts ever graphically shown; Aronofsky instead employs the same quick-cut
montages of heroin being cooked, straws taking in lines of coke, pill
bottles being opened, and pupils dilating.  Jarring and visually exciting
at first, these images become rather boring through their incessant
repetition--much like how the initial euphoria of drug use evolves into
mundane routine.
When I say _Requiem_ is about feeling, it should be noted that I mean
that in terms of sensation and not emotion.  The only character with much
depth is that of the lonely Sara (superbly played by Burstyn), and even
so she's still kept at the same arm's length emotionally as are the other
three.  This initially struck me as a flaw (especially in terms of the
Harry/Marion romance), but it reflects the greater ideas that Aronofsky
is trying to evoke.  The film being told from the point of view of the
addicts, the detachment is all but appropriate since they're not really
concerned about others or even themselves, just the fix.  Additionally,
the distance also reflects the way outsiders generally look at drug
addicts--as in, they don't, choosing to safely turn a blind eye. 
_Requiem_ doesn't give the audience the option of complacency; as its
last 30 minutes brutally detail everyone's raw ruin, the film seems to
dare the viewers to look away.  And it's a testament to Aronofsky that as
difficult as it is, it is impossible not to watch.
There may not be a profound emotional connection to any of these
characters, but the actors make them into convincing human beings, the
destruction of whose lives we witness before our eyes.  The resulting
feeling with which one walks away from _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is not
sadness, but a heavier, emptier sense of loss--one that's even harder to
shake.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Jeremiah Kipp.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/c0d27d402232edf3882569740004ddd7?OpenDocument
        Imagine Trainspotting without any trace of humor and you're on the
right track.  Picture Pasolini's Salo: 120 Days of Sodom shot by some
MTV music video kid interested in the novelty of his new camera.  Darren
Aronofsky (Pi) stacks one degrading sight atop another without
implicating the viewer, nor providing any framework or reference for his
visual rape of his audience  - all smoke and mirrors disguising a great,
vapid emptiness.
        For starters, I've never seen Coney Island junkies who look as pretty
as Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), who bear a passing
resemblance to the kids from Calvin Klein ads.  They're drug dealers who
have high aspirations, saving their earnings for a better tomorrow. 
Placing all their cash in a locker, they sit under the boardwalk smoking
up and dreaming their grandiose dreams.  Too bad they get high too often
off their own supply.  The good times can't last forever.
        The drug use scenes are done in vivid smash cuts showing dilating
pupils, squeezing needles, the sizzle of white powder cooked in a
spoon.  We never see these kids shoot up -- rather, we see abstract
images.  Every time this technique appears, it's too flashy and aware of
its own experimental filmmaking approach, a purely stylistic flourish.
        Kronos Quartet wrote the driving, thumping, angry, brutal violin score
which drums like a hammer and chain beating you into submission.  Harry,
Tyrone, and their ambitious if drug addled friend Marion (a very good
Jennifer Connelly), who could be a great designer were it not for her
plunge into addiction, eventually become slaves to their own destructive
destinies.  They run out of money, and in the second half of the movie
they move through a bleak winter, suffering the eternal torments of the
damned.
        Each situation is set up so neatly, we're certain where the path will
lead.  Harry sports a nasty welt on his arm which doesn't look so good. 
Tyrone discovers that maybe that trip to Florida to track down some
fresh supply was a bad idea -- since them southern boys don't like
colored folk.  Marion eventually telephones a sadistic pimp (Keith
David) and sells her body for drugs.
        The movie's first scene involves Harry stealing his mom's television
set.  She can always go right down the block in half an hour and buy it
back.  That's their adorable dog and pony show, and poor Sara Goldfarb
(Ellen Burstyn) is too nice, too soft around the edges, so apathetic she
won't do anything about it.  Her husband is dead, Harry is all she's got
left.
        Ellen Burstyn is so good, so unglamorous and believable as a Brighton
Beach Jewish mama, that she shines through Aronofsky's bag of tricks and
delivers a strong, sad, comic performance.  At first, Sara seems to
share the addiction of the film's other characters, endlessly watching
her television, but when she gets a surprise phone call asking her to
appear on a TV show she realizes she's too overweight to fit into the
red dress her husband once admired her in.  She goes on a diet.
        Unfortunately for the audience, midway through we realize that Sara's
in trouble.  She's gone to a quack doctor for some diet pills, which
turn out to be speed.  She's gnashing her teeth in no time, and the
worst is yet to come.
        Sara's refrigerator starts roaring like a lion as the images become
fuzzy and, well, straight out of Terry Gilliam's superior Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas.  In short order, Sara wears the same junkie shoes
as her younger co-stars.  While it's painful to watch a harmless old
woman descend into the circle of hell, she could easily have escaped it
by going to another doctor for a second opinion.
        Some critics are sure to fawn over Requiem.  It goes further than most
films into uncomfortable territory, and the spinning visuals are
technically accomplished.  I'm sure Darren Aronofsky's courage will be
extolled -- yes, it's so bold to show human misery without sympathy or
understanding.
        I'm not against violence or torture onscreen.  The best film to compare
Requiem to is Pasolini's Salo.  Wisely, Pasolini used restraint with his
camera and simply filmed people being sexually abused and beaten without
showy fanfare.  Salo creates a hollow, disturbing feeling of
helplessness.
        Ultimately, Aronofsky lacks that crucial insight when showing the
nature of horror.  His gaze feels inexperienced.  Perhaps young
filmmakers should not attempt to tackle the bleak world before they have
had a chance to go through it themselves.  (Salo was Pasolini's final
film; Mike Leigh's bleak Naked was made when he was middle aged.)
Once we get past the notion that addiction is a horrible thing (which I
don't believe is news to anyone who will watch Requiem for a Dream), the
question remains: What purpose does this film serve?  Let me know if you
figure it out.

Writer/director Darren Aronofsky was turned down flat when he approached
Artisan Entertainment about following up the success of his debut film, PIE,
with an adaptation of this 1978 novel by Hubert Selby Jr. Aronofsky's reply
was simple: "Well, you don't have a choice". The studio wanted something a
little more "commercial" from the up-and-coming auteur, but Aronofsky had
his heart set on this film since his early days at Harvard. The studio
finally agreed but only if they co-financed the film with another production
company, which they did. Aronofsky and Selby worked together off the
latter's own lost 1979 screenplay draft discovered in his mother's old
Brooklyn cellar to create the script for this film, and the rest as they
say, is history.
PLOT:
A deep, dark look at the conjoined lives of several people whose search for
love, happiness and their seemingly unattainable dreams, ultimately gets
caught up under the snag of addiction.
CRITIQUE:
A harrowing tale about the extreme damage associated with addiction and the
pursuit of happiness, this film should be applauded for taking such a
familiar subject matter and slapping it around with innovative visuals, a
haunting score, undeniably courageous performances from all of its leads and
a consistently gripping narrative. And despite obvious comparisons to both A
CLOCKWORK ORANGE and TRAINSPOTTING, it's obvious that Aronofsky has managed
to create a cult classic of his own here. Reaching deep down into his
arsenal of visual gadgeteries, the director makes use of every style
utilized by Scorsese, Tarantino, Fincher and Gilliam, and one-ups them all
with a visual melange of inspirational creations of his own. This is one
movie that you will never be able to forget. It sticks in your mind, no
matter what your impression of the final product. In the end, it's about
lost, disconnected people. Lonely, beyond belief, searching for an answer
within a quick fix solution, a solution, which in itself, can only take them
so far. And as their simple dreams get further out of reach, and their
addictions to external substances takes over, the film gathers a palpable
sense of impending doom, as each character respectively spirals down a
hellish experience of their own. All of this leads to one of the most
intense denouements that I have seen on screen in years.
The film is also optimized to the nth degree in sound and visuals, as every
move, scene, thought and circumstance is attached to an accompanying
symbolic effect or another, used to reinforce the chaos of each situation,
and to a certain extent, their repetitive and continuous nature. Think
addiction. This movie is also filled with unforgettable imagery and a
powerful score, which helps beat the film's cataclysmic sentiment right into
your brain. I still cannot shake that infectiously morbid sound. The film is
obviously sad and very depressing in a lot of ways, but still manages to
undoubtedly punch home the obvious anti-drug and anti-addiction message
underlying it all. To me, the film also ventured to comment on some of the
most obvious effects of alienation and anti-socialization in our society.
Everybody wants to be loved, but when you can not attain that love, what do
you do? Of course, all the camera tricks and music in the world could never
fool an audience unless the film itself stood on a solid script packed with
believable characters, and even more importantly, actors who allow you to
buy into their parts. This film managed to give us four very strong
performances from its leads, each of whom seems to have taken great care in
their interpretation.
Marlon Wayans has you completely forgetting about his TV antics after the
first five minutes of this movie, with a true dramatic performance deep in
symbolism and high on effectiveness. A guy trying to do good, looking for
that lost love from his mom, but just falling short every time. Leto also
surprised me as the overly industrious guy caught between the love for his
mother and his devotion to his girlfriend. Fullfilling the male void in both
of their lives, Leto is simply not able to satisfy their lonely patterns,
and subsequently succumbs to one of the most horrific separations of them
all. But for me, it was the women who held the even stronger cards in this
flick. Jennifer Connelly, with the performance of her career, manages to
look absolutely beautiful in one scene, and absolutely horrific in the next.
Her character's transition from uppity rich girl to down-and-out junkie is
remarkably portrayed, as Jennifer bares all for the role and her character's
ultimate degradation. A case can definitely be made for each of these
wonderful actors to receive a nomination of some sort by the end of the
year, but Ellen Burstyn is undoubtedly already seated at the Oscar events of
year next. A complete transformation of both physical and mental state,
Burstyn takes us through one of the loneliest characters to be showcased on
film, with an evocatory performance which lends itself to much pause for
reflection. Ultimately, it is the inability to reach their dreams and their
love that drives each of these characters into a nightmare of their own.
It goes without saying, that this film is not for everyone. It is sad,
depressing, confusing at times and extremely experimental in a lot of ways.
In other words, if you're looking for a 1-2-3 movie, this ain't for you.
This movie is for deep thinkers. It's also for those who themselves suffer
from an addiction of some sort. And yes, ultimately, it is for anyone who
has ever felt let down by a dream which they could not grasp, a love which
they simply could not attain, or a connection which they just could not seem
to make. The characters in this film make the mistake that many of us do
when we try to find the solution of our malaise on the outside of ourselves.
Almost every time, the solution lies within, but many of us are just afraid
to face up to that lonely place.
PS: I still can't get Ellen Burstyn's line of "I'm gonna be on television"
out of my head.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Darren Aronofsky asked a favor from two of the leads in this film:
Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans. Stay away from sex and sugar for a period of
30 days so that you could really feel that need for something you crave.
Wayans said that he was "cool" with it until he found out that "no sex" also
meant "no orgasm". Wayans was like, "You mean I can't even hump my pillow?"
Leto lost 25 pounds during this transformation and after the film wrapped,
shaved his head and checked himself into a monastery in Portugal to get his
head straight (Entertainment Weekly, #567, p. 46).
Ellen Burstyn's role was both physically and emotionally demanding. In
addition to having a camera mounted to her for certain sequences, Burstyn
spent four hours every morning being fitted with prosthetics, wearing four
different necks (both fat and emaciated), two different fat suits (a
40-pound and 20-pound suit), and nine different wigs.
Director Darren Aronofsky has been chosen to create the next BATMAN movie,
which according to him would be based on Frank Miller's "Batman: Year One"
graphic novel. The story details the first year of Bruce Wayne's life as
Batman, including the self-doubts and blunders he had to overcome in order
to emerge as a full-blown crimefighter.
A cool fun fact about this film is that the actual author of the book on
which it is based (and co-screenwriter of the film) has a cameo in the
movie. Seventy-three year old Hubert Selby Jr. plays the "laughing prison
guard" near the end of the film. Ironically, he is laughing at his own
characters.
Another cool thing to note about this film is its almost complete lack of
the color red. Aronofsky did this on purpose, with Sara's hair and dress
being the only places where you should find red in the movie. He said, "We
did this because the color red was at the core of Sara's dream. We wanted
the color to leap off the screen."
Aronofsky's mother Charlotte is also cast in this film as one of Sara's
yenta friends, and his father Abraham, as the man reading the newspaper on
the subway.
Most movies contain 600 to 700 cuts. This film contains over 2,000.

Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) dream comes true when she's invited onto her
favorite game show.  Her son Harry's (Jared Leto, "American Psycho") dreams
are shared with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly, "Dark City") and
best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) when the perfect heroine score presents
itself.  But drug addiction will destroy the dreams of not only the obvious
younger generation, but the Jewish Brooklyn housewife as well in director
Darren Aronofsky's ("Pi") "Requiem for a Dream."
Writer/director Darren Aronofsky allows just the briefest glimpse of hope
before taking his audience on an unrelentingly dark descent into the ravages
of drug addiction (as adapted from the Hubert Selby Jr. novel).  Although he's 
graced by a tour de force performance from Ellen Burstyn and career high turns 
from Leto, Connelly and Wayans, the film is a stylistic achievement bearing a 
shopworn message.
We're introduced to Sara as she cowers in a locked room while her son
'borrows' her beloved television to fuel his drug habit.  Once he's flush
from a once-in-a-lifetime score, he buys her a fabulous new television,
but is alarmed to learn his mom's become an amphetamine junkie courtesy
of a local 'diet' doctor.  Her game show dreams will not be complete unless
she can fit into a special red dress worn on a family occasion twenty years
ago.
Of course, Harry also neglects his own advice and dips into his own stash,
losing his fortune and forcing Marion back into the arms of Arnold (Sean
Gullette, "Pi") to secure cash.  This is just the beginning of all three's
far worse fates.
Aronofsky's film seems a throwback to the 70's, a feeling he intensifies
with his use of split screens, retro costume and art direction, and the casting
of Louise Lasser as Sara's friend Ada.  Current flair is also apparent in
some MTV style editting (each needle set up is preceded by the same jangly, 
flash-paced montage ending with a dilated pupil) and the in your face bleakness
which is depicted (the film's climax, which features a two-woman anal sex
show, amputation, forced feeding and shock treatments earned the film its
NC-17 rating).
Burstyn is fabulous as the meek, naive housewife who loves her only son.
Her harrowing decent into madness is jolting, like you were watching a
kindly elderly relative enter hell.  Leto retains sympathy by letting the
true love he feels for his mother shine through.  A genuine family bond
can be felt between the two.  Jennifer Connelly simply has never been better
as Marion, an artist estranged from her bourgoise family who loses every
shred of human dignity by affixing her star to Harry.  She's never more
affecting than when she begs Harry to return home over the phone before 
going dead-eyed at the realization of what she'll need to do to get her
next fix.  Wayans is also good, if underutilized, as Ty, who also reflects
on the love of a single mother.
Technically, the film is well done with a unique style.  Particularly admirable
is the editting by Jay Rabinowitz, who keeps the dual stories moving forward
coherently, often spending only seconds with Sara before cutting to Harry.
Sara's Coney Island neighborhood lends real character to the film.  Kronos
Quartet provide strings (which actually get a bit overwrought, but I think
that was the point).                                           
As well done as this was, I found myself walking out thinking, hmm...drugs
are bad.  The film has none of the humor found in recent drug films such as
"Trainspotting" and "Sid and Nancy."  It will put you threw an emotional 
wringer even as you're wondering what the point is.

Retrospective: Requiem for a Dream (2000)
Sitting alone in her chintzy Brighton Beach apartment, overweight and
elderly Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) consoles herself with her two main
addictions: television and sweets. Her favorite television show is an
infomercial that features a self-assured man in a suit striding up and down
the stage telling his studio audience and forlorn people at home like Sarah
that they can turn their lives around. All they have to do is give up red
meat and sugar, and turn on to the inner resources each have within
themselves--something he calls "juice". When he utters the word "juice,"
the audience maniacally begins chanting the word in unison as Sarah stares
beatifically at the TV screen hoping that she too some day will discover
her own "juice."
Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie and small-time drug-dealer. When we
first meet him and his best friend and fellow junky-dealer Tyrone (Marlon
Wayans), they have seized Sara's television and are wheeling it down the
desolate streets of the industrial blocks near Brighton Beach in order to
deliver it to a hock shop, where they are frequent visitors, always with
the same TV set.
One day Sara receives an invitation to appear as a contestant on a
television game show. This represents the possibility of deliverance from
loneliness and inadequacy. She embarks on a self-improvement program to
make her more attractive for the upcoming television appearance. One of her
Brighton Beach cronies, played to the hilt by Louise Lasser, dyes her hair
red. This will match the red dress that sits in her closet, the one she
wore to Harry's high school graduation. There is only one problem: it is
now way too small.
She puts herself on a crash diet that excludes all sugar and fatty foods.
In doing so, she experiences withdrawal symptoms in a food-addict's version
of "cold turkey." When fantasies about cheeseburgers and pastries prove too
much for her to take, she looks up a diet doctor who prescribes 3 sets of
pills in different colors that must be taken morning, noon and night.
Meanwhile Harry and Tyrone have stepped up their drug-dealing in an effort
to break into the ranks of the big time and to achieve their own kind of
"juice." Some of the proceeds are targeted for a dress-design shop to be
run by Harry's girl-friend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), a junkie herself.
The ambitious plans of mother and son soon begin to unravel. Although her
weight begins to evaporate, Sara finds the side-effects of the drugs both
frightening and painful. She has waking nightmares in which her
refrigerator appears to advance toward her like a Frankenstein monster with
a life of its own. When Harry visits her to announce that he is presenting
her with a brand-new giant-screen television, paid for by revenues from his
expanding drug trade, he is alarmed to find his mother grinding her teeth
uncontrollably like a speed freak. When he tells her that she is addicted,
she answers that this is impossible. A doctor prescribed the pills, so how
can she be addicted.
But addicted she is. Unlike her son and his friends, she is a victim of
"approved" drugs which are every bit as harmful as those peddled on the
streets by her son. Director Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream",
based on his screenplay adaptation of a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., takes
these characters and shows with unstinting and gruesome honesty how
addiction can destroy lives. The powerful but deeply disturbing climax of
the film depicts the unraveling of mother and son, as the search for
satisfaction and acceptance proves elusive. Unlike the typical film about
addicts, which tends to view them as weak people with character flaws,
Aronofsky's film leads to a different kind of a conclusion--namely, that
society itself is flawed.
Although Darren Aronofsky is an extremely talented director and screenplay
writer, this film would have been impossible without Hubert Selby Jr., one
of the great American writers of the past half-century. Now over seventy
years old, Selby is best known for his collection of short stories "Last
Exit in Brooklyn" which like "Requiem for a Dream" depicts the sufferings
of working people and drifters living at the margins of society in the
hinterlands of Brooklyn. Although Selby is linked stylistically with the
Beat Generation, especially William S. Burroughs, I find him to be a
throwback to the Depression Era, especially the bleakly surrealistic novels
of CP'er Nathaniel West.
In an April 18, 1999 interview with the British newspaper, The Independent,
Selby takes aim at American society:
"The fascism in this country today is incredible. But things go through
cycles. Look at McCarthyism. That started in the 1950s and went through for
quite a while. So the basic pathology is always there. In this country, our
escape, regardless of what technology's around, has always been money. The
so-called 'bottom line' is God, over absolutely everything. So regardless
of what else is going on, there is that fix." 
In dealing with the ups and downs of Selby's career, which during down
phases had him pumping gas or on welfare, the British interviewer who is
altogether sympathetic to the legendary writer, says, "I didn't mean to
upset you. It's just that America seems to hold a terror that England
doesn't. In England there's still a net. But in America you can be an
upstanding citizen for years and then suddenly through a combination of
unfortunate circumstances you fall and you are ... " 
Selby completes the interviewer's sentence:
"Dead. And this is the richest country in the world, in every way possible,
and we have millions of children starving. Can you f---ing believe that!
THIS IDEA OF EFFICIENCY AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS MADNESS." (emphasis added)
Hubert Selby Jr. was the Brooklyn-born only child of an engineer and a
housewife who joined the Merchant Marines at the end of WWII, just like
Jack Kerouac. Around this time, he contracted tuberculosis. In an effort to
save his life, doctors removed 10 ribs so they could collapse his left lung
and snip out part of the diseased right one.
During his recuperation, according to a profile that appeared in the March
11, 1988 Los Angeles Times, he sneaked out for nights of drinking and would
pass out in snowbanks, only to be rescued by neighborhood friends. Soon
afterwards he also developed a $100 a day heroin habit. This led to a
90-day, drug-related prison stint and a four-month stay in solitary
confinement at Bellevue Hospital after attempting suicide. 
This personal hell was occurring in the late 1940s, when he was also
hanging out with the characters who would form the inner core of "Last Exit
to Brooklyn" and "Requiem for a Dream."
Although "Requiem for a Dream" is an art movie bordering on the
experimental, it is currently playing at commercial houses all around the
country. It is not to be missed.

In 1998, first-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky set the entertainment
industry on its ear when his $60,000 ? took the Director's Award at the
Sundance Film Festival.  The grainy 8mm black-and-white film, which was
about a super-genius mathematician who found a 216-digit pattern in the
world that could both predict the stock market and reveal the true name
of God, jettisoned Aronofsky into the upper echelon of young, hip and
talented directors ready to be seduced and corrupted by the Hollywood
system (he's supposed to be making the next Batman installment).
The temptation to make a bigger and better film must have been
incredible.  Imagine having a budget nearly 100 times larger, as well as
the ability to cast well-known acting talent as opposed to friends and
family.  The result is Requiem For a Dream, a frighteningly dark look at
addictions in modern society.  It's a good film, and it's certainly
bigger than ?, but unfortunately, it's just not better.
The film is set in present-day New York City near Coney Island, where a
middle-aged mother and her junkie son regularly square off over the
television set.  Harry (Jared Leto, American Psycho) keeps taking the
appliance to a pawnshop to support his heroin addiction.  Sara (Ellen
Burstyn, Playing by Heart) is tired of buying her set back from the same
pawnbroker.
Harry's friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, Scary Movie) and girlfriend Marion
(Jennifer Connelly, television's The $treet) are hopheads as well.  They
figure out a way to make a bunch of money from a really big drug score,
but their plan goes awry.  Like big drug scores ever go down correctly
in the movies.
In the meantime, Sara is just as addicted to television as her son is to
smack.  Sara particularly loves this one game show, and her life is
thrown into disarray when she receives a phone call telling her that
she's been chosen to be a contestant.  She dyes her hair and digs out a
flashy red dress that can no longer be completely zipped.  Long story
short, Sara ends up strung out on prescription diet pills, thanks to an
unscrupulous doctor.
So you've got four characters hopped up on various chemicals.  Can the
gifted Aronofsky capably handle hallucination scenes?  Oh, Lord, yes.
They're the slickest since Trainspotting (although they aren't set to
Lou Reed and Iggy Pop songs).  Aronofsky uses so many different filming
techniques (split-screen, fish-eye lenses, altered playback speeds,
scene repetition and even cameras strapped to his actors) that Requiem
often feels like an all-out assault on the senses (but in a much better
way than, say, Armageddon).  Don't attempt to adjust the picture.
Turning around and heaving popcorn at the projection booth won't stop
Requiem from damaging your tender eyes.
Actingwise, Requiem is a one-man show.  Burstyn is incredible as the
tormented Sara.  If she fails to get an Oscar nomination, there should
be rioting in the streets.  She should get the award for one scene
alone, where she's simultaneously being hypnotized by the television and
chased by the refrigerator.  Interestingly enough, October is a banner
month for the 67-year-old actress.  In addition to knocking them dead in
Requiem, she's lighting up the box office with the re-release of The
Exorcist, and stars in That's Life, one of the better-reviewed
television shows debuting this fall.
On the other side of the acting coin are Leto and Connelly.  Although
they're both pretty easy on the eyes, their talent remains very much in
question.  Connelly's greatest asset is widely believed to be her chest,
which is usually more prominently displayed than her acting chops.  Leto
tries out a New York accent here, but mainly just offers more of the
same blank stares that made him so popular as the dim-witted Jordan
Catalano on My So-Called Life.  Guess what, kids?  He wasn't acting.
How does a guy with talent this marginal keep getting cast in cool, edgy
films, like American Psycho, Fight Club and The Thin Red Line?  Wayans
is nearly unrecognizable as Tyrone, but that's probably because it's his
first role where he isn't acting like a retard.
The plot isn't much to write home about.  Most people already know that
a drug addiction can do a pretty good job of messing up your life
without having cinema cramming a similar message down their throats.
Requiem is based on a novel written by Hubert Selby, Jr. (he also wrote
the book that became Last Exit to Brooklyn) and adapted for the screen
by Aronofsky and Selby.  The story follows four characters to ? s one,
and Aronofsky seems to have a bit of trouble with the pacing of the film
because of it.  But just when it seems like Requiem is about to derail,
the director tosses in an unexplainably cool, repetitive clip of the
three kids cooking up their stuff and getting bent.
Requiem was photographed by Matthew Libatique (Pi) and edited by Jay
Rabinowitz (Ghost Dog), the latter of whom is probably deserving of some
year-end accolades, as well.  The film contains one of the more sexually
explicit scenes you'll see in a mainstream film (featuring  surprise! 
Ms. Connelly).  This one is definitely not for the kids, the faint of
heart, or people who suffer from epilepsy.
1:42  Not rated, but contains nudity, strong sexual content, adult
language and violence

   When the gifted film maker Darren Aronofsky hit the scene
two years ago with the wildly imaginative, $60,000 movie
called "Pi"--about an obsessed mathematician who thinks
that numbers could determine God's identity and, more
important, calculate the course of the stock market--the
relatively few people privileged to take the movie in knew that
an innovator was born.  The sincere performances by a no-
name cast coupled with attention-getting visuals (particularly
when Sean Gullette's character got himself into the throes of
a cluster headache) told us that we could expect more of the
same ingenuity in films to come.  The gobs of additional
capital for his current feature has not spoiled Aronofsky.  He
is well on the road to achieving the American Dream that he
so brutally savages in "Requiem for a Dream," though we
doubt that he'll fall into the trap met by virtually all of the
principal characters of this grisly tragedy.  
   While the film's surface says "Beware of drugs" (in much
the way that other such works as the groundbreaking "The
Man with the Golden Arm" and the New York-situated "Panic
in Needle Park"), Aronfsky and his co-writer, Hubert Selby Jr.
on whose book the screenplay is based, take on a grander
subject: the illusory pursuit of the American Dream.
   Its young, energetic, and Calvin-Klein-thin principal Harry
Goldfarb (Jared Leto) wants cash to allow him to break out of
his lumpen neighborhood of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn
together with his lonely mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn).  There's
nothing wrong with this aspect of the Dream.  What makes
the situation compelling as drama while savaging the notion
of getting ahead is that the characters are obsessed with
arriving too quickly.  If fantasies of wealth, fame and attention
are global in scope, the ambition to attain them fast fast fast
is fundamentally American.
   "Requiem" plaits the story of a number of people addicted
to drugs, the younger ones interested in heroin as both a
means of getting high and a way to earn big bucks, the older
member addicted to amphetamines as a means of rapidly
losing weight in order to look great on a promise TV
appearance.  
   The story begins as grimly as it concludes.  Harry has once
again broken the chain that secures the family TV to the
radiator, carrying the equipment yet again to the local pawn
shop together with his drug-eating pal, Tyrone (Marlon
Wayans), both of whom require the money not only to
secure heroin fixes for themselves but to expand their
business as pushers.  Sara, once again buying back the TV
from the hock shop whose proprietor is her long-term
neighbor, feeds her own addiction to an infomercial hosted by
the slick and charismatic Tappy Tibbons (Christopher
McDonald), who is able to evoke amazing cooperation from
his dumbed-down live audience. Receiving a cryptic phone
call which promises her an appearance on television some
time in the future, Sara is determined to fit into a red
dress she had worn many years earlier, visits a Dr. Feelgood,
and begins gulping speed pills--which she ultimately takes in
huge quantities causing her refrigerator to bounce up and
down like a character in a Stephen King story.  While she
harbors perfectly respectable hopes for her son Harry to get
married and provide a grandchild for her, Harry carries on a
prolonged affair with the addicted Marion Silver (Jennifer
Connelly), an affair which is on an appealingly joyful
foundation until the roof and indeed all the walls give
way.
   The plot, however mocking of the quick fix toward the
American Dream, does not give the film its primal value. 
What lifts "Requiem" above similar movies done during the
drug-happy 1970's such as Ivan Passer's "Born to Win"--
about an ex-hairdresser (also set in New York City) and his
$100-a-day heroin habit)--is the frequent but not excessive
use of surreal effects.  The bounding refrigerator is as worn a
plot device as the romping furniture in "The Exorcist," and
yet under Mr. Aronofsky's directorial eye the ice box is able
give us in the audience the cold shivers.  "The Man with the
Golden Arm" has nothing on Harry's festering and
gangrous veins, which even his seen-it-all partner, Tyrone
cannot bear to look at, nor can the doctor who inspects the
infected appendage (played by the imitable Dylan Baker in a
surprisingly brief cameo).  Time after time, Aronofsky throws
in an MTV-inspired cartoon, showing two gargantuan pills
dissolving as though in liquid, followed by a pop pop pop and
an eyeball with an inflating pupil.  Aronofsky repeats this 
effect with more humorous ones when showing the ruggedly
dieting Sara rapidly consuming a grapefruit, a hard boiled
egg, and a cup of Joe for breakfast.
   The cast as a whole rises to the occasion.  Ellen Burstyn,
seen shortly after the opening of this film in James Gray's
"The Yards," delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as an
aging mother whose only real problem, loneliness, turns into
the catastrophic dilemma of a psychosis that must be treated
with electroshock.  Her transformation from a typical lower-
middle class Jewish woman on the rundown shores of
Brooklyn's Brighton Beach to something out of Anatole
Litvak's 1948 groundbreaker "The Snake Pit" is a credit to
her skills as a major American performer.  Marlon Wayans
rises to the occasion.  Fresh from an over-the-top manic stint
in "Scary Movie," Wayans turns in a productive act as a
thoroughly wired addict looking to score both the next fix and
the American Dream.  Even Woody Allen would appreciate
the comic touch of elderly women lined up on beach chairs
outside an aging tenement, all crying out, "Hello Harry" over
the glare of their sun reflectors.

Sara Goldfarb is being harassed, literally, by her refrigerator in 
writer and director Darren Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.  Aronofsky, 
who rocketed to fame with his first indie film, PI, is back with a 
roller coaster ride about drug addition.  It is an audacious film that 
will certainly win an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn, who 
plays Sara.  And if there were any justice in the world, it would win 
one for Aronofsky as well.  This movie, however, is the complete 
antithesis of a Hollywood production and so has little chance of being 
recognized with Best Picture or Best Director nominations.
First and foremost, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is an assault on our senses.  
Easily the most visually audacious movie of the year, its camerawork 
(Matthew Libatique) and editing (Jay Rabinowitz) are astounding.  
Approximating the effects of drugs on the brain, sometimes the film 
speeds up like a bullet train, and other times the action slows to a 
crawl.  Especially effective are the close-up images of everything from 
drug preparation to pupil dilation to paper airplanes.  
The cornucopia of images flow over our systems like a drug rush.  We 
aren't merely witnessing the cataclysmic effects of drug addiction; we 
are experiencing them up close and personal.  The director makes just 
the right choice in minimizing the surrealistic scenes in favor of 
speeding up the realistic ones.
>From the first frame, the director comes out swinging.  The film doesn't 
really start, per se.  Instead, we are thrown into a story that has been 
going on for a while.  We feel much like viewers who have just turned on 
in the middle of a television series.
When we meet the angelic-looking Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), who loves 
his Ma, Sara, dearly and adores his girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer 
Connelly), he is busy stealing his Ma's television.  After pawning it, 
he buys drugs to get high with his friend, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon 
Wayans).   His mother just heads down to the pawn dealer to buy it back 
again in a ritual that seems to have been going on since the dawn of 
time.  Even if Burstyn's acting is the best of the bunch, all of the 
leads deliver probably the best performances of their careers.
Sad and lonely Sara has her own addiction, television, especially a 
motivational show starring Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald).  Its 
big rules on its road to nirvana include no red meat and no refined 
sugar.  One day she is invited to come on the show sometime in the 
indefinite future.  This causes Sara to move up the addiction chain.  In 
order to get into her old red dress for the show, she goes to a diet 
doctor.  ("How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb," the nurse asks perfunctorily, as 
Sara steps onto the scales.  "Enormous," she replies in embarrassment.)  
The doctor prescribes salvation in the form of a heavy regiment of diet 
drugs.  Although losing weight initially makes her popular among the 
little old Jewish ladies that live in her building and wile away their 
days trying to soak up the sun, eventually it destroys her body and her 
mind.
Meanwhile Harry, Tyrone and Marion are busy devising a series of 
get-rich-quick schemes involving selling drugs.  Harry brags to his Ma 
that he is working for "sort of a distributor for a big importer."   So 
hyper with diet pill uppers that she looks in danger of exploding, she 
doesn't ask for any details.  Their plans, however, are thwarted by 
their overriding need to consume what they are supposed to be selling.  
This puts them down a path of destruction that leaves them doing 
absolutely anything to get drugs to feed their habits.  For Marion, the 
bottom of the pit occurs when she puts on a two woman sex show for a 
room filled with suits.
As the four of them descend into their own hells, it is hard to watch 
but impossible to look away.  Caring deeply about each of the 
characters, we would no more turn away from them than we would a loved 
one.  When the ending credits come, your audience will probably be like 
mine.  No one moved or breathed.  We were all frozen in our seats.  
REQUIEM FOR A DREAM runs 1:42.  It is not rated but would be NC-17 for 
drug usage, graphic images, nudity, sex and language and would be 
acceptable for college students and older.

Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Screenplay by Hubert Selby Jr and Aronofsky,
based on the novel "Last Exit To Brooklyn" by Selby Jr. Starring Ellen 
Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated R 
for controversial subject matter by the MFCB. Reviewed on February 18th, 
2001.
The hiss of a burner. The thrust of a needle injecting into the 
bloodstream. The dilation of a pupil as the drug takes effect. These are 
the images director Darren Aronofsky invokes over and over again in 
"Requiem For A Dream", one of the most remarkable, affecting and 
devastating movies in recent history. This is a film about drugs and the 
people who are hooked on them. But Aronofsky, not content merely to 
portray their debilitating influence on the lives of his characters, also 
uses brilliant cinematic trickery to draw the audience into the addict's 
frame of mind. "Requiem" is a trip in its own right -- disorienting and 
exhilarating and exhausting -- and that is perhaps most disturbing of all.
Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a twentysomething junkie with an 
ever-present need to get high. He's not the only one: his best friend 
Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are 
addicts too. Harry even goes so far as to steal furniture from the home of 
his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) to sell to a pawnbroker for a few bucks. 
(In one notable early scene, Sara drops by shortly thereafter and buys 
back the furniture: this is evidently a routine that has been repeated 
many times.) Harry and Tyrone dream of graduating from buyers to dealers; 
for his part, Harry hopes to repay his mother for everything she's put up 
with over the years, and wants to fund Marion's dream of becoming a
fashion designer. But neither of them really appreciates the peril 
inherent in their line of work -- from rival sellers, from the law, and of 
course from the drugs themselves.
Sara, meanwhile, is a widow who has all but given up on the remaining 
years of her life. She spends her time eating junk food and watching 
television, or sitting in a lawn chair in front of her apartment building 
with other aging belles, gossiping and getting sunburnt. One day, Sara 
gets a phone call which leads her to believe that she will soon appear on 
her favourite programme, a bizarre combination of game show and self-help 
promo. Sara seizes on this as an excuse to lose weight and get back in 
shape, and on the advice of one of the other women visits a doctor who 
prescribes her a daily menu of diet pills. At first, everything goes well 
and the pounds seem to drop off. Soon, though, the prescribed dosage just 
doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to, so Sara doubles up... 
and doubles up again... and again...
"Requiem For A Dream" benefits from several outstanding performances, none 
of them more exceptional than Burstyn's. Hers is as courageous, as 
difficult a performance as they come: Burstyn assumes an already pitiable 
character and exposes herself to indignity piled upon indignity. Sara 
Goldfarb represents what I expect many people dread as they age. She is a 
woman who no longer lives her days but merely endures them, whose future 
seems destined to consist of nothing more than the same tedious routine. 
She has no prospects, nor the energy to manufacture them.
It is hard, then, to not feel a glimmer of hope for Sara when she believes 
she might appear on her game show. It's fairly obvious from the start that 
this is a hoax, but perhaps this is just what Sara needs to reinvigorate 
her life. It is, therefore, all the more horrifying and disturbing to 
witness her downward spiral into diet pill addiction. Instead of Sara 
being lifted out of her routine, that routine has simply been made more 
terrifying. For instance, the fridge is no longer a source of transient 
comfort, but is now a monstrous nightmare: Sara hallucinates it burbling 
nastily and lurching toward her. The second half of the movie, as Sara's
appearance crumbles while her days race by in an addiction-fueled blur, is 
as scary as a formula slasher films put together.
Also well-handled is Harry's story, even though these segments are 
somewhat less absorbing -- perhaps because Harry and his friends just 
aren't as sympathetic as Sara. Leto gives a solid performance, mixing a 
naive optimism with the obstinacy and resourcefulness necessary to 
maintain his lifestyle. Harry's real tragedy is that he believes he can 
use drugs to his own advantage, when in reality it is the drugs that are 
using him. For instance, consider how, near the end, Harry willfully 
ignores the deterioration of his own health because he refuses to accept 
anything that might come between him and his fix. Wayans (so far removed 
from "Scary Movie" so as to be virtually unrecognisable) and Connelly turn 
in laudable supporting performances, as addicts who meet their own dismal
fates.
As important to "Requiem" as its strong acting is Aronofsky's direction. 
He embraces his medium here, employing such devices as quick editing, 
enhanced sound, and unusual perspectives to portray the universe from the 
disjointed point of view of his characters. (In most hands, the sight of 
an angry refrigerator would appear preposterous; here, it is petrifying.) 
In one notable scene, Harry and Marion are in bed together. Aronofsky 
divides the screen in two, with one half focussing on Harry and the other 
on Marion. Despite the fact that we know they are lying next to each 
other, their influence is barely felt beyond the edges of the other's 
frame. In this way, Aronofsky effectively conveys how the couple is 
together, and yet vastly apart -- a facet of their relationship which 
becomes increasingly pronounced later in the film, when a shortage of 
drugs drives them to desperate recourses.
Perhaps most astonishingly, Aronofsky successfully tells his story in 
"Requiem" without ever seeming preachy. This is a film of brutal, awful 
reality, not just another "Afterschool Special"-type exercise, and is 
infinitely more effective as a result. Forget narcotics and 
pharmaceuticals: after viewing "Requiem For A Dream", you'll think twice 
before popping so much as a vitamin pill.

Darren Aronofsky made an indelible splash with his debut film, the unique
science-fictionesque mathematical thriller called "Pi." That black and white
film, written by the director, is a stylish, intellectual flick that left a deep
impression on the viewer. Now, Aronofsky gives us his sophomore effort based on
the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. in a story of drug addiction that crosses
generations in "Requiem for a Dream."
Ellen Burstyn is Sara Goldfarb, a lonely, aging Jewish matron who lives for the
chance to appear on her favorite TV game show hosted by Tappy Tibbons (Chris
McDonald). Recently released from a mental care facility, Sara also lives under
the delusion that her junkie son Harry (Jared Leto) is a successful young man
with a beautiful fiancee who he plans to marry and produce a grandchild for
Sara.
Harry is on a fast track to disaster with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer
Connelly) and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry, the man with the plan,
has the idea that they should pool their cash, make a big score of smack, cut it
up and sell it for a profit, continuing the process until they have enough money
to buy a corner grocery store and live happily ever after. One problem. They
make the deal and agree to "let's do a little taste. It's business." One taste
leads to another and the downward spiral continues.
Meanwhile, poor, deluded Sara learns that she has been selected as a possible
candidate to appear on her beloved game show. Convinced that she is going to be
on national TV and loved by millions, she further fools herself that Harry is
doing fine and will soon marry. Gazing at a photo of her and Harry when he
graduated high school, she vows to go on a crash diet until she can again wear
the slinky dress from the picture. Normal dieting doesn't work, but a friend
tells her that a local doctor can take care of the problem easily. Sara takes
the advice and begins a legal amphetamine addiction that rivals her son's
illegal heroin needs.
While "Requiem for a Dream" is a finely crafted film that benefits from good
acting, especially Burstyn, a well-written script by Aronofsky and the novelist,
and confident direction by the second-time helmer, it is, in a word, a bummer. I
don't mean that it is a bad film, but the subject matter and the depiction of
uncontrolled addition, especially of the aging Sara, are gut wrenching in
display and detail of the despair. As things spin out of control for the four
addicts there is a palpable feel of hopelessness permeating the movie.
Things start off pretty shaky from the beginning and deteriorate fast for all
the principles, reminding me of the early Al Pacino film, "Panic in Needle
Park." In the 30-year interim between the 1971 film and "Requiem for a Dream"
there has not been any changes in the world of drug addiction. Now, as then,
drugs, whether legal or not, can destroy lives and filmmakers like Aronofsky
seem to revel in the depravity of this subject.
The helmer gives weight to each of his characters' stories. Sara is sadly
sympathetic as we watch this lonely lady cling to the false hope of fame, while
falling prey to legally sanctioned addition in the form of prescribed diet
pills. Burstyn gives a solid, harrowing character study that is also an
indictment against the incompetent medical industry that permits the legal
creation of such hapless victims. The actress deserves acclaim come year's end.
The youthful trio led by Leto are pathetic in both their needs and their
desires. Their united front to become heavy-hitting drug dealers soon falls
apart as the need to shoot up overrides all else. Harry ends up losing his arm
to dirty needles, Marion debases herself sexually for a fix and Tyrone ends up
doing hard time for dealing. All in all, these folks are not poster children
used to extol the use of heroin. The ending, with all of the victims curled into
the fetal position, pretty much punctuates the powerful anti-drug theme of
"Requiem for a Dream."
Aronofsky makes no bones about dealing with unconventional film fare in his
first features, displaying a dark, educated intelligence in filmmaking and
storytelling. Neither of his films is compelling from a mainstream sense and
"Requiem" delves into the darker side of human existence and waves it before us
like a flag, daring us to watch. His depiction of the addictions and the
treatments that our society provides to its addicts is hard stuff to watch and
should not be approached blithely.
"Requiem for a Dream" is not for the average movie-going bear and is geared for
the hard core film nut who relish addiction flicks such as the aforementioned
"Panic in Needle Park," "Lost Weekend" and, even, "Trainspotting" (though the
latter is almost lighthearted in its treatment of substance abuse). The
demographic target for "Requiem" is focused on a extremely tight viewing
audience with a specific agenda. I doubt if it will get beyond the art
house/film buff exposure. It's a harsh film but with excellent technical
attributes and fine performances by Burstyn and all. Think about it but be
prepared to be shocked. I give it a B.

 REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (director/writer: Darren Aronofsky; screenwriters:
 Hubert Selby Jr/from the novel of Hubert Selby Jr; cinematographer:
 Matthew Libatique; editor: Jay Rabinowitz; cast: Ellen Burstyn (Sara
 Goldfarb), Jared Leto (Harry Goldfarb), Jennifer Connelly (Marion
 Silver), Marlon Wayans (Tyrone C. Love), Christopher McDonald (Tappy
 Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Sean Gullette (Arnold the Shrink),
 Keith David (Big Tim); Runtime: 100; Artisan Entertainment; 2000)
A slickly done, very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs
and their dreams of happiness. The dream that sucks the four main
characters (Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans) ever downward, is the
American Dream. That is shown to be as deadly an addictive and as
dangerous a one as any junkie's high.
Darren Aronofsky's (Pi) adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the
forlorn, is given an image transfusion on the screen that belies the
fact that the addicts can't kick their habit and what we are forced to
see are their elusive visions and the wretched futility that unfolds for
them. It's a film that has excellent performances, especially, the
brilliant one by Ellen Burstyn, as the pill popping old lady who
morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills.
She plays Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) -- a Brighton Beach widow living
alone but obsessed with her only son. Her life is so empty that she
spends her time either watching TV game shows, staring at her
refrigerator, or sunning herself outside her apartment building with her
elderly women neighbors. She's overwhelmed that she's been selected as a
possible contestant on a game show, and decides that she's too fat and
must slim down to get into her favorite red dress she wore to her son's
graduation. She wants to impress the TV audience with her successful son
and how good she looks, and that motivates her to see a doctor who
prescribes amphetamines of different colors four times daily and within
a month she loses 25 pounds. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto) has
become a heroin addict and also has an empty life filled with misplaced
dreams, which are on about the same surface level as her dreams; his are
about striking it rich as a drug dealer. His series of misfortunes will
culminate in his arm turning into a deep purple infection. In the climax
scene, both mother and son are hospitalized as a result of their dreams
turning into nightmares.
Aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief
of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives. It's
not an easy film to find comfort in, or feel anything but revulsion at
the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place. It's
also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug
addictions that are fresh. What continually sparkles for this film, is
the way the mother-son relationship smacks of reality and how protective
they are of each other despite being unable to communicate with each
other. The best scenes in the film were when either Harry or Sara were
reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope. The heaviest
scenes were also the most creative ones, showing in montages the
constant barrage of  their wants and how twisted they were inside.
Mother's refrigerator talks to her and gets her into a dizzying speedy
motion as she moves about her empty apartment, while her son is shown
coming down from his heroin highs and settling into a despondent mood.
Harry has fallen in love with his girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer
Connelly), whom he knew from his childhood days in Brooklyn. Their love
and hopes for marital bliss is built around the possibility that he
could score a big drug deal with his equally ambitious black partner and
best friend, Ty (Marlon Wayans), and become financially secure. The
young men can't see themselves growing old and still being small time
hustlers and junkies, as they pin all their hopes on a big drug killing.
In the process, Harry degrades himself and Marion. When he needs money
to score his drug product, he has no qualms asking Marion to sleep with
her former therapist Arnold (Gullette-he starred in the director's
"Pi"), someone she reviles as a sleaze bag.
By the film's end, not much substance came through all the stylishly and
graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent;
what I mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see
any more of their hellish experiences. It's a movie where the first half
of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and
predictable second half. I can applaud the director for his visual style
of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the
screen in a realistic way, but the story of four losers who can't get
out of Brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss
attached to it.
