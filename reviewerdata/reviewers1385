Keywords: author=polenz
A top judge from Ohio is selected to be the new head of the DEA and learns 
the ropes of America's war on drugs while at the same time having to deal 
with the fact his  own daughter is an addict. Several other subplots 
intertwine with this story including a pair of detectives who have brought 
down a local drug dealer and need him to testify against an even bigger 
trafficker whose wife never knew what he REALLY did for a living. Also, a 
fearless Mexican police officer plays both sides of the law against each 
other while he unknowingly helps one drug lord wipe out the top rival. There 
is no one central plot to the film, just these three stories overlapping with 
dozens of supporting characters playing vital roles. 
Top-notch performances by the cast give the serious-as-a-heart attack story 
even more depth and credence. Direction by Steven Soderbergh is magnificent 
in successfully bringing all the characters and stories together combined 
with superb cinematography. Each subplot is shot in a unique way giving them 
their own mood and motif - quite a risky move for such a mainstream Hollywood 
movie. If "Traffic" isn't great for its powerful and relevant theme it at 
least works as an entertaining character drama reminiscent of Paul Thomas 
Anderson's style. 
The notion of the nation's top drug czar the clueless father of a junkie is 
trite, forced and quite unbelievable at times. The message this film is 
trying to send comes across loud and clear, but usually it's subtle themes 
that make great movies truly great. Later, when we see Michael Douglas (the 
czar) driving through the ghettos looking for his daughter it's hard not to 
laugh at him. He's driving around in his Mercedes assuming that since he is 
in the bad part of town it's a guarantee that's where his daughter will be. 
The subplot involving the two detectives and their key witness is utterly 
predictable and when the good housewife suddenly becomes the kingpin in her 
husband's absence it's also quite difficult to swallow. And the third-string 
plot about the Mexican cop is kind of confusing. 
Soderbergh's direction is excellent but another draft of the screenplay would 
really have smoothed out the many bumps in the story. At least all the actors 
are excellent in their respective roles, making even the most hackneyed 
scenes come off as serious and realistic as they are intended. 
This film could have been a masterpiece but the final cut can't balance the 
poignant theme with the need to cram in so many characters, so many 
storylines and a few too many typical Hollywood stunts and gimmicks. At least 
20 minutes could have been cut without sacrificing the story or the theme. 
Have you ever read an in-depth article in Rolling Stone or the New York Times 
about the facts of this war? It's astonishing when you realize how much money 
is spent and how little progress has been made. So many people are in jail 
for such small drug offenses and so many upstanding members of the law 
enforcement community have died or suffered in one way or another doing 
something they have been told is such a noble, worthy cause. This film begs 
the question, "Is all this effort really worth it? Is this the best way to 
attack this problem?" 
Still, "Traffic" earns high acclaim from me for its courage to tell such a 
condescending story about the war on drugs so well. This is one of those 
movies that really makes you think because it has such relevance to the world 
we live in - you may even recognize the characters and the scenarios from 
your own life. It's a movie you'll debate your friends and family about - and 
that's what it wants to do.

Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
It's a western, an action movie and a comedy all rolled up into one. But it's 
also a Jackie Chan movie so that
automatically makes it a lot more likable to begin with. 
The story is simple, Chan stars as a Chinese imperial guard who must travel 
to Carson City, Nevada in the
late 1800s to rescue a princess who thought she was going there to start a 
new life but actually walked right
into a kidnapper's trap. 
Owen Wilson costars as Roy O'Bannon, a train robber who I think is Han Solo 
in a former life. When the
two find themselves as a team a lot of hilarity and action ensues. Wilson is 
really charming as the supposed
bad boy and so is Chan as the ignorant immigrant. 
The story is really all over the map but it's forgivable because the two men 
are so fun to watch and the
action sequences are so exciting. This is how action movies are supposed to 
work.

Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett), a widow who struggles to raise her children in 
a small town in Georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the 
case of a missing woman. Annie is something of a psychic, she has involuntary 
bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and 
physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions. Her "gift" leads 
to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the 
pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property. In an ultra conservative 
backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in 
court? Do they even have the right man?
Aside from Keanu Reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as 
the loathable redneck Donnie Barksdale, there is little else going for the 
film. 
Lame, unoriginal screenplay. Predictable ending. Suspense scenes that are 
just plain boring. Ridicously trite characterization makes the entire South 
out to be ingnorant, hateful goobers. Relentless in its emotional 
sensationaliztion. 
"The Gift" is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you've seen 
this story before. It's a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the 
South ever made, and coming from a Yankee like me who dislikes the South 
that's really saying something. 
For an established, talented director Sam Raimi is unable to provide any kind 
of originality to this film. It's predictable from the first scene, the 
screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play. You 
know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn't actually do it. It's no 
surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive 
was. Sigh, how trite. 
For a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it's so 
cliche. "The Gift" is basically a glorified b-movie.

A Hollywood film crew invades the small town of Waterford, Vermont for its 
authenticity of an old-fashioned small American town where everyone knows 
each other's names, the firehouse is the same one used 100 years ago, and 
they have an old water mill. Problems arise when the screenwriter is called 
in to makes changes to the script on the fly because the old town is missing 
a few key landmarks and the starring actress doesn't want to do the nude 
scene. The film is also going over budget and the starring actor could be in 
big trouble with the law due to his craving for teenage girls. 
Writer/director David Mamet tells this story in the style of a classic stage 
play or musical, a la "Our Town" or "The Music Man." He keeps the atmosphere 
satirical which allows the comedy to work quite well. And yes, this is a 
comedy, but a thinking man's comedy where the jokes are derived from witty, 
biting jabs at Hollywood. You've seen this stuff before such as in "The 
Player" or "Bowfinger," or on quite a few sitcoms but Mamet's approach is a 
little different to keep it original, fresh and unpredictable so that when 
the story suddenly shifts or a wacky jokes pops up out of nowhere you're 
genuinely surprised. 
Sometimes Mamet's mannerisms can be really annoying, especially if you're 
familiar with his work. If you're not, it includes characters repeating 
themselves; slowly-paced scenes and unnecessary foul language. 
Rebecca Pidgeon plays essentially the same character she did in "The Spanish 
Prisoner" - an eccentric smart woman with a penchant for detail who likes to 
force herself onto others. She doesn't talk like a real person and when she 
dumps her fiancee for the screenwriter whom she's only known for a few days 
it comes across as quite lame and forced. 
"State And Main" also has its moments of unbridled zaniness that reminds you 
of something on "Frasier." Although most of the comedy is original the jokes 
that are predictable are REALLY predictable. 
It's nice to see Mamet lighten up a bit, relatively speaking. This being 
something of a throwaway, insignificant story it's still a heck of a lot 
better than if some Hollywood clown tried to write and direct it their way. 
"State And Main" has a well-written screenplay of nuances and detail that's 
never gratuitous. Everything has a reason for being put in the place that it 
is. What's more, it even makes good use of the film-within-the-film's 
supposedly Oscar-caliber theme about getting a second chance. The actual film 
isn't quite THAT good, but it is a refreshing and satisfying change of pace 
that anyone would be bettered by seeing it.

Summary: r.a.m.r. #28092
Keywords: author=polenz
A quasi docudrama/quasi horror movie about the making of a classic vampire 
movie, "Nosferatu" in Germany in the 1920s. John Malkovich plays an obsessive 
director who goes for as much detail as you could possibly get out of dreary, 
grainy black and white film and no sound. Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, an 
"actor" playing the role of the Dracula character who isn't wearing making 
and isn't method acting - he really is a vampire! The story shows how Schreck 
is a lonely old man who just happens to fit the mold of the vampire cliche we 
know today. He scares the bejesus out of the cast and has a taste for human 
blood while Malkovich films him for authenticity purposes. You're supposed to 
wonder who's the bigger nut - the vampire pretending to be an actor playing 
the role of a vampire or the director for exploiting him. This is obviously 
meant to be a thinking man's horror film since the scariness is derived from 
these strange men's behavior but it never really comes across that way. 
The art direction and production design give a totally realistic, authentic 
look of the heydays of B&W silent movies and the equipment and sets the film 
crews had to work with at the time. When the scenes of the movie within the 
movie are shot the frame closes to a 3:2 ratio with a very grainy, dreary 
picture - the exact opposite of digital remastering. It's a poetic homage to 
the past and a gutsy technique to use in this day and age. Malkovich and 
Dafoe also give excellent performances but as good as they are, they can't 
carry the movie entirely by themselves. 
I'm a big appreciator of ambiguity and the concept that true terror is based 
on what our five senses can't pick up on. "Shadow Of The Vampire" is meant to 
appeal to our sixth sense so that we're frightened by the fact a REAL vampire 
is playing the role of one in a movie and does things a real vampire would 
do. Yes, Dafoe is excellent in his role but he's not scary or disturbing, 
he's just weird. Maybe I'm just cynical because I'm used to more mainstream 
fare, but this movie only has a few good moments and isn't great throughout. 
There's not enough characterization of the supporting cast, there's a lot of 
details missing from the main plot, the suspenseful sequences are a little 
trite and the ending is forgettable. 
The running time is only 85 minutes or so - that tells you a lot right there. 
For a docudrama to work you need to spend a lot more time with the characters 
- get to know them personally and intimately. We never do that with this 
troupe. Everyone's just kind of a tool to make the plot payoff. Throughout 
"Shadow Of The Vampire" there's many many hints of personal drama and inner 
demons to the characters but the screenplay can't balance the story with 
characterization. One minute we're on the set of the movie, the next it's 
some personal subplot that never comes to fruitation and doesn't have a lot 
of significance overall. 
This is one of those movies where you know exactly what the filmmakers were 
trying to do and you still don't enjoy it. A mediocre product but a good 
effort nevertheless. 
RATING: ** (out of **** = fair/below average)

Review for Wo hu cang long (2000)
Think "Star Wars" but set in ancient China and throw in a lot more drama and 
romance and you might have an idea of the scenario. It's a complex story of 
forbidden and unspoken love and the universal war of good versus evil. Chow 
Yun Fat plays a noble warrior trying to escape the life he has lead. Michelle 
Yeoh co-stars as the warrior's lifelong but unspoken lover who is also an 
accomplished fighter. Zhang Ziyi is the REAL star of the show as Jen, a 
teenage girl who has secretly studied a mystical form of martial arts under 
an infamous criminal known as Jade Fox - the nemesis the two warriors are 
hunting when they all come together. A sub-plot involves Jen's romantic 
affair with a wandering bandit and her inner conflict to give up a life of 
aristocracy and eliteness for the freedom of being a road warrior and with 
the man she truly loves. 
Just about everything that could go right for this picture does. The 
screenplay is full of detail, wonder characters, a rich background of the 
Chinese culture as well as a lot of ambiguity and mysticism towards the 
martials arts aspects. Although the story takes place in the "real" world the 
fighters here have the ability to defy gravity and other laws of nature yet 
they're still weighed down by basic human emotions and flaws. Director Ang 
Lee brings it all together wonderfully, pacing the film with energy and 
fluidity throughout so that the dramatic plotlines never drag on and the 
romantic aspects are very effective and quite moving. He also manages to keep 
things just a bit lighthearted with some comic relief that's well-timed and 
not at all distracting. 
There are absolutely no flaws other than the fact the film is in Chinese and 
not English but that just makes it all that more authentic.
It's difficult to compare "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" with anything 
mainstream because it's so vasty different from the kind of entertainment 
we've come to expect here in the west. This film combines elements from many 
different genres and how it manages to successfully make them work together 
is some kind of cinematic alchemy that only comes along a few times in a 
lifetime. 
I saw this movie three times and upon each viewing it became even more 
enjoyable, more exciting and more romantic. How many Hollywood movies can you 
say that of? This is a story that is so full of authenticy and detail it 
creates its own sort of reality and consciousness. I can only compare it to 
the "Star Wars" movies  or "2001" because it works on that kind of level - 
where it's not a movie that you either enjoy or don't - it's an metaphysical 
experience (and no, it's not just something sci-fi geeks would like, ANYONE 
could enjoy this film). 
I hope this is nominated for and wins many Academy Awards. One of the best 
movies ever made, seriously folks.

Summary: r.a.m.r. #28094
Keywords: author=polenz
Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as Hannibal "The Cannibal" 
Lector in this sequel to "Silence of The Lambs" (which itself was a sequel to 
1986's "Manhunter"). This time Hannibal is living free as an art historian in 
Italy while back in the U.S. one of his former patients and his 
sole-surviving victim is offering a large bounty for the capture of Hannibal. 
Julianne Moore plays FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling who has become 
extremely hard-edged and unemotional and follows the case while at the same 
time trying not to become a patsy to some of her superiors. 
The film has a strong first half setting up all the details of the complex 
story and interdependent plots and subplots. With four major characters with 
their own motivations and conflicts there's a lot to balance and director 
Ridley Scott manages to juggle the complicated screenplay rather well.... at 
first. 
Anthony Hopkins is again superb as the frightening psychopath, totally 
overshadowing and upstaging everything and everyone else. 
Moore is waaaaaaay too stiff in her portrayal of Starling, who is so rigid 
she makes Dana Scully look like Krusty the Clown. And what's with the accent? 
It's a shame Jodie Foster turned down this role, she could have held her own, 
Moore is at the mercy of poorly-written dialogue and little characterization. 
The story drops off sharply after the midway point so what was at first 
intense and intriguing becomes cliche and confusing. Having Hannibal on the 
loose is a good way to induce suspense, but he's actually too likable to be 
as menacing as he could and should be. In fact, throughout the last act when 
the tables turn he's practically the hero! The victim who's out to get him is 
just a bit too cliche to be taken seriously. 
And the biggest flaw is this movie is just disgusting! The victim with no 
face is freaky, but the scene showing how he lost his face is pretty noxious. 
The notion of having man-eating boars as your killing device is pretty creepy 
and a bit unbelievable too (the second time this year this technique has been 
used - "Snatch" made it work a little better). The scene at the end will 
certainly go down in film history as one of the grossest scenes ever in a 
mainstream film (it involves amateur brain surgery). 
As a thriller, "Hannibal" gets a passing grade, but I think this might 
actually be a horror movie. What made "Silence of the Lambs" so great was its 
balance of detective work and the psychological fear Hannibal Lector induced 
simply by looking at you and the fact he was incarcerated and could escape. 
Now that he's free he's almost rehabilitated himself until the bounty hunters 
come after him. It's quite clear what's going to happen to said hunters. 
Bringing the story back to a Starling versus Lector conflict probably would 
have helped, throwing in this third storyline of the victim out for revenge 
is an interesting storyline but the screenplay doesn't make it work. I mean, 
how many times has the character of an eccentric rich guy been used before? 
I'd compared him to Mr. Burns on "The Simpsons," and could HE really frighten 
you? 
Another draft of the screenplay and tighter direction would have made this a 
great movie, this is too mediocre for its own good.

Summary: r.a.m.r. #28091
Keywords: author=polenz
Well, it's kinda hard to explain. It's centered around a collective circle of 
British gangsters who are all in one way or another trying to get their hands 
on a huge diamond the size of a peach. The movie jumps back and forth between 
four individual stories with their own subplots to bring it all together 
through excellent editing and direction. It's a macabre crime flick in the 
spirit of "Pulp Fiction," or "Get Shorty," but with that zany European twist 
to give it an original, fresh outlook. You're not really expected to follow 
the story to the letter since there's about a dozen main characters and the 
plot constantly twists and turns, the film is about the ride of it all. 
I haven't seen such a good mix of direction, editing and screenplay in quite 
a few years. It's such a welcomed change of pace compared to all the 
countless Quentin Tarantino wannabes (ahem - Christopher McQuarrie). 
I really enjoyed how "Snatch" is a mix of so many different characters who 
are all connected in some way but don't really know it. I usually have a 
difficult time trying to keep track of an ensemble cast so director Guy 
Ritchie does us a favor by introducing all the characters at the beginning by 
telling you who they are and what role they play in the British criminal 
underground. No heavy taxing on the brain that way! 
The British accents can often be indecipherable (and I don't just mean Brad 
Pitt's character). The actual story is quite a challenge to properly follow 
and the ending is a bit more violent and cliche than it needed to be. 
Excellent performances by Pitt and the entire cast make the film a success. 
When you're making a crime movie that's supposed to be funny at times and 
deadly serious at other times you'd better have good actors who can pull off 
both comedy and drama smoothly. 
I really enjoyed the editing and direction of the film, even if the story was 
a bit tricky. In fact, I can't help but think it was purposely written so 
complicated to make us THINK it's really a piece of brilliance. I mean, this 
is a crime movie at the core so often the action and sheer carnal violence 
are the driving forces. 
So you want a rollercoaster ride at the movies? "Snatch" is just that, 
exciting, funny, suspenseful, always entertaining and creative as could be. 
Falls a little flat at the end but that's forgivable. Will very likely be on 
my top ten list for 2001 and is best movie of the year thus far.

Keywords: author=polenz
The Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s are re-visited in this docudrama 
that tells the story behind the headlines, of what was going on in the JFK 
Whitehouse at the time (or what MAY have been going on, this is a movie after 
all and Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate). 
The film is able to take a real-life situation and exploit it for its 
intensity without making it seem like a cliche, half-baked action flick. 
Everything shown on camera has some documented truth to it so it's kind of 
like being brought back to the actual situation and reliving it all. The cast 
is made up mostly of obscure working actors who all shine beautifully. 
The entire movie is one really long intense moment, like those parts in 
regular thrillers where the heroes have to make a quick, crucial decision, 
only here it's compounded tenfold and never comes off as trite or lame. 
Kevin Costner seems to have been cast simply to give the movie a name to sell 
to the public, which is unfortunate because he's terrible at faking accents 
and quite distracting here. The film also wastes time by trying to play up 
the sentimental angle of showing Costner's family being so distraught by the 
crisis. The whole country is feeling the exact same way so it's pretty much a 
given families might experience a lot of grief and still be brought closer 
together in the end. 
Movies about war have been done to death, but what makes "Thirteen Days" 
stand out is that it's about AVOIDING war. And not just any kind of war, 
nuclear war, which could have very well spelled the end of the modern world 
as we knew it had it happened. 
I'm not a history major and I doubt much of the audience attending this film 
will be either, but that's okay because virtually the entire story is one big 
history lesson. The Cold War was a bitter, intense standoff that lasted 
decades between the United States and the Soviet Union but no film has really 
taken the time to tell a smart, detailed story of how it worked at the 
highest level. Here, the story is realistic, most of the characters are 
historical figures who likely did the things they did in this movie. 
For two hours two nations have their fingers on the launch bottom, each 
waiting for the other to blink first. How we managed to not blink is quite 
amazing, and even though you already know the outcome before you even see the 
movie it's still fascinating and mysterious. 
One of the best thrillers ever made. 


Title
Review for What Women Want (2000)
Mel Gibson stars in his first romcom in 10 years as Nick Marshall, a rich 
sexist ad exec who suddenly gains the ability to hear women's thoughts after 
being electrocuted. With the sudden comic book-like superpower he realizes 
what women really think of him, what appeals to women and how to woo his new 
co-worker Darcy (Helen Hunt). There's also a sub-plot of Nick trying to 
relate to his teenage daughter as well as another romantic encounter he has 
with the woman at the coffee shop he sees every day. 
Gibson gives a very good performance showing he's a talented actor, not just 
a pretty face. The screenplay includes a lot of very funny jokes exploiting 
the character's magical ability to hear what women are thinking - combining 
trendy pop culture references with the standard one-liners and zany 
pratfalls. The plotline involving Gibson's wooing of Hunt is pretty 
convincing and the two have good chemistry making this one of the few romcoms 
that actually work. 
Although the main storyline is concise and the jokes work the screenplay is 
far too elaborate for an otherwise elementary Hollywood movie. The subplots 
about Nick trying to get along with his daughter and the girl at his work 
who's secretly suicidal aren't handled nearly as tactful as they should have 
been. The ending has not one, not two, but THREE climaxes all involving Nick 
"saving" a woman in one way or another. 
The comedy is certainly winning but the film takes its plot a little too 
seriously. This film could have been the biggest accomplishment for feminism 
in years if it had ended any other way. Not only is it a totally lame cop-out 
as far as filmmaking goes but it sells short the theme that men should listen 
to them, be sensitive, be self-sufficient and not be so... you know... manly. 
. Apparently women aren't as liberated as we think, they still need men to 
come to their rescue.
