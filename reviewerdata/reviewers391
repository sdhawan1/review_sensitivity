Title
Review for Rosalie Goes Shopping (1989)
     Yesterday I went and saw this film, hoping to find something
wonderful like BAGDAD CAFE' or pleasant and simple like ZUCKERBABY.
     There are many movies that I don't care for, but can see why others
would enjoy them or find some value in them.
     This movie was just drivel, it had no redeeming features.  There
was no plot, only there slightest hint of a story.  It was not an art
film, it was incoherent to the point of wondering what was going on.
There were many scenes that added nothing to the film, either in terms
of the plot or the mood.  The photograpy was technically good, but
special effects were used everywere and just irritated the viewer.
Anyone can rotate a polariser while filming.  Large uninteruped sections
of dialog in german exceeded the ability of most people to extrapolate
from the context.
     This should have been a short story - 15 minutes at the most.  I
really resent having paid A$10 to see this, especially when it is
advertised as brilliant like bagdad cafe.  In short it isn't it is a
great dissapointment.
