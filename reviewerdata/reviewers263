Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
   In this suspense thriller Michael Duglas is an all work and no joke
business man. Duglas who plays a man with no wife only a housekeeper who's
known th family since Duglas' character was a kid. In the movie Duglas
watches his father leap to his death on his 48th birthday. Now it's
duglas' 48th birthday and his brother wants to do something special for
him. Something fun. This present was pretty much a game. The company CRS,
is a company that plays with your mind(as a viewer and a character).  They
manipulate Michael Duglas by messing with his life. Sean Penn who is
metioned a lot on the commercials is not at all as big a character as you
would expect, but he plays his part to the fullest. This is a must see 4
star movie. Probably a few Academy Award nominations. Best character, best
screenplay,and best movie.
