Title
Review for Spoorloos (1988)
     Have you ever gone to a public place, like a shopping centre, or a
pool, or a petrol station, and lost track of your friend/
sibling/wife/husband/child?  Have they then inexplicably failed to show
up at a pre-arranged meeting place, leaving you to torture yourself with
horrible thoughts about what might have happened to them?
     This is the topic of the newly released Dutch film, THE VANISHING.
This is no horror movie, and yet it can be very scary; it evokes that 
mildly terrifying experience of loss and panic that most of us have had.
     Although it's a Dutch movie, most of the dialogue is in French and
almost all of the action is set in France.  It's about a young Dutch
couple who drive to France for their summer holiday, as young Dutch
couples tend to do.  They stop at a petrol station, and red-headed
Saskia goes inside to buy a Coke and a Beer.  She never returns.  Her
husband (Rolf?) freaks out, but is unable to locate her and eventually
has to return to Holland.  For three years he runs a desperate poster
campaign to locate her.  Then, .... well, I don't want to spoil it for
you!  Suffice to say that the plot takes a devious turn, and the movie
climaxes in one of the  most surprising and emotional endings I have
ever seen.
     And most distressing of all, it's 100% believable.  SEE THIS MOVIE!
and if anyone tries to tell you the ending, KILL THEM!
     It's currently showing in Brisbane; I don't know about any other
cities.
