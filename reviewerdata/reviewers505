A couple of years ago, I watched as a visibly uncomfortable Freddie 
Prinze Jr. was paraded in front of reporters like a prize steer 
during a promotional appearance in Hollywood. As the cameras flashed 
and the emcee pummeled him with a series of stunningly inane 
questions, the young actor looked desperate to get out of the room. 
The next day, I spoke with Prinze about the incident and he 
acknowledged that the experience was awful, adding, "To be honest, 
I'm still kind of learning how to do the celebrity stuff. It's not 
what I got into the business for. I understand that it's part of the 
job, but I'm not very good at it."
The British love story "Notting Hill" examines the pitfalls of fame 
and does a surprisingly good job at it. Regular readers know that I 
have little tolerance for most contemporary romantic comedies. 
Watching a glamorous couple meet cute, fall in love, scamper about 
while pop songs play in the background, fight over some contrived 
situation and, flung back together by ridiculous coincidence, make up 
just in time for one more song usually makes my skin crawl. but I 
surrendered to the charms of "Notting Hill." 
The script, by "Four Weddings and a Funeral" writer Richard Curtis, 
follows the Romantic Comedy 101 formula religiously, but hits enough 
high notes to triumph over the clichés. What really makes this film 
special, though, is the exceptional work of Julia Roberts and Hugh 
Grant. 
Before "Notting Hill," Hugh Grant consistently left me cold. His 
acting technique, a combination of excessive blinking, twitching and 
stammering, was disquieting, to say the least. It's hard to enjoy a 
man who appears to be in desperate need of nervous-tic medication. 
Thankfully, he tones down the mannerisms this time around. As William,
 the quiet owner of a small London bookstore, Grant creates an 
engaging character. Kind, but self-contained, he projects a sweet 
sadness as a man who, having lost at love, finds comfort by wrapping 
himself in a blanket of benign depression. William's safe little 
cocoon soon unravels when American movie star Anna Scott walks into 
his shop. 
As Anna, Julia Roberts is a revelation. Radiant as always, Roberts 
also shows remarkable depth here, perhaps because of her familiarity 
with the circumstances. Like Roberts, Anna is a superstar whose mere 
presence creates a sensation. Accustomed to non-stop scrutiny, she 
has developed an elaborate veneer and an equally sensitive defensive 
system. When she detects betrayal, she is quick to strike out at the 
offender, as happens in one of the film's most arresting scenes. 
Because of Robert's wonderfully nuanced performance, I completely 
believed in Anna and empathized with her plight. How hard it must be 
to strive for success in the arts, only to find yourself caged in a 
zoo of celebrity that never closes.   
Roberts and Grant interact beautifully, gliding over the numerous 
bumps in the production. Curtis' script contains many sweet moments, 
surrounded by virtually every cliché in the book. I noted each 
formula situation, but instead of becoming irritated, I was content 
to let them roll by, knowing another treat was soon to come. Yes, 
William's gross-out roommate (Rhys Ifans) plays like a gimmick with 
legs, but Anna's nonplused reaction to him is so perfect. Yes, the 
camera needlessly emphasizes the gawkish appearance of William's 
working class extended family, but what an appealing family they are. 
One contrivance I couldn't excuse was an extended scene at a press 
junket, where William must pretend to be a reporter to keep an 
appointment with Anna. After their conversation, he is swept into a 
series of one-on-one interviews with the other actors from her film. 
In the real world, junket security is air-tight, one-on-one 
interviews are rare and actors never, ever ask your opinion of their 
movie. In a story where dramatic credibility hinges on realistic 
portrayals of media-celebrity exchanges, the scene is just sloppy 
writing. To make matters worse, it goes on too long with too few 
laughs.
But enough carping. Better to think of the picturesque Notting Hill 
marketplace, or the delightful birthday dinner, or the striking 
passage-of-time shot showing William walking down the street as the 
seasons change around him, or the wonderful crane shot in the park, 
when the camera glides up into the night sky, adding a lyrical 
perspective to the couple below. And what a couple. Thanks to Hugh 
Grant and the luminous Julia Roberts, "Notting Hill" works, both as a 
love story and as a reminder that those figures ducking the paparazzi 
are just other people, as lost, foolish and essential as you and I.

Talk about bad timing - "O," which transplants Shakespeare's "Othello"
to a modern US high school, was scheduled for release two years ago. But
then some twisted boys in the real world went to school and shot their
classmates and teachers. Suddenly, a movie with a key scene depicting
armed students attacking one another didn't seem like such a great idea.
For awhile, it looked like "O" would never be screened. Then a smaller
studio took the troubled film, releasing it not in early summer but in
late August  just in time for the new school year. Hmmm.
In this version of the classic tragedy, Othello becomes Odin Jones
(Mekhi Phifer), star basketball player (and the sole black student) at a
private Southern school. O, as he is better known, has everything going
for him  he's a sure bet for the NBA, Coach Duke Goulding (Martin
Sheen, doing an operatic Bobby Knight impersonation) treats him like
royalty, and his girlfriend, Desi Brable (Julia Stiles) is charming and
beautiful.
Ah, but trouble is brewing. Coach Goulding's son Hugo (Josh Hartnett) is
jealous because dad likes O more than him. So the boy hatches a plan. He
will use insecure, horny Roger (Elden Hensen), naďve Emily (Rain
Phoenix), O's best friend Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan) and his own
poison tongue to ruin his rival.
The melodrama works because high school is quite possibly the most
melodramatic place on Earth. When O takes in Hugo's lies, you
understand, because love makes a high school student susceptible to the
most outlandish ideas. As the Shakespeare play heads toward the horrific
ending we know so well, it seems plausible, given the emotional
fragility of the participants.
Still, this is a bumpy ride. The script makes liberal use of the word
"nigga" and tosses a few "faggots" in as well. I don't know about you,
but I could go a lifetime without ever hearing any variation of those
words again. And don't waste my time arguing about oppressed groups
reclaiming hate words for their own benign use  when one of those words
is voiced, regardless of the circumstances, some dim-bulb will assume
that means it's okay for them to use it as well.
The acting is spotty. Josh Hartnett, sporting that godawful bed-head
hairdo he favored before "Pearl Harbor," gives a performance consisting
almost solely of wincing and whining, while Julia Stiles seems overly
confined playing a character forced by the script to act illogically at
the worst times. Mekhi Phifer struggles a bit during the more grandiose
parts of his meltdown, but is credible overall.
Sadly, "O" is most convincing during its darkest moments  partially
because of the filmmakers effective use of the mossy Southern settings,
but mostly because it has now become far too easy to equate horror and
high school.

In response to the critical drubbing he received for "Armageddon," 
director Michael Bay pointed to the box office receipts and speculated 
that film critics may be out of touch with popular tastes. Hopefully, Bay 
will catch a screening of "The Mask of Zorro" and realize that it's still 
possible to make a rousing popcorn flick without treating your audience 
like wide-eyed rubes suffering from attention-deficit disorder.
Packed with action, intrigue, humor and romance, "The Mask of Zorro" has 
all the payoffs one expects from a contemporary big summer movie, with 
the style of a classic Errol Flynn swashbuckler. It's the kind of film 
that leaves you sighing at the end, not just out of satisfaction, but 
also in relief that they didn't screw it up. Put that in your rocket-
launcher and smoke it, Mr. Bay.
The prologue begins in 1821, when two young brothers help Zorro prevent 
the execution of a group of peasants. We learn that Zorro is the 
aristocratic Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), mortal enemy of vile 
Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson). Just when the 
triumphant Don Diego is ready to retire and devote himself to his wife 
and young daughter, Montero invades his home and exacts a horrifying 
revenge.
Twenty years later, Montero returns with a new scheme for power. The 
aging Zorro recruits one of the brothers who helped him so long ago, 
outlaw Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), and trains him to continue 
his legacy. Complicating things is the presence of the beautiful Elena 
(Catherine Zeta-Jones), Don Diego's daughter, who Montero kidnapped and 
raised as his own.
"The Mask of Zorro" works because it takes the time to actually set up 
the story, and the trouble to create three-dimensional characters whose 
fates matter to the viewer. Having a whale of a cast doesn't hurt, either.
Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the graying hero. His Zorro is noble, 
witty and just a bit full of himself. He insists on perfection as he 
trains young Murrieta, and has the strength of character to make you 
understand why the bandit obeys.
As the new Zorro, Antonio Banderas shines in a role he was born to play. 
Rakishly handsome, Banderas convinces both as an outlaw and later, as a 
hero. His Murrieta has a rough-hewn sense of style and a chip on his 
shoulder that Don Diego is more than happy to knock off. The two men work 
well together, despite their clashing egos. 
Catherine Zeta-Jones proves that she's more than just an incredibly 
beautiful face as the smoldering Elena. Clearly her father's daughter, 
her fiery eyes glisten with defiance and intelligence. Sparks quickly fly 
between her and the dashing Murrieta, adding sexual chemistry to the 
film's mixture of passion and derring-do.
Of course, characters as rich as these need a juicy villain and Stuart 
Wilson gives them one as Montero, investing him with enough humanity to 
make his wicked deeds all the more horrifying.
Director Martin Campbell does an exceptional job bringing the script to 
life, giving the production a rich, fluid feel as he dances between 
heroics, romance and humor. The stunts and sword fights have a snap to 
them and the audience truly becomes involved in the action, even at its 
most far-fetched, thanks in large part to the passion given the 
characters. As opposed to typical summer entertainment, "Zorro" has only 
one big explosion. That one explosion pays off beautifully, because the 
filmmakers understand that restraint always works better than overkill.
At 136 minutes, "The Mask of Zorro" is just a little too long. As good as 
the sword fights and narrow escapes are, a few less would have helped 
this larger-than-life adventure. But that's small criticism for the first 
summer popcorn movie of 1998 to fully deliver all it promised. 

Title
Review for City of Angels (1998)
City Of Angels (1998)
Nicholas Cage, Meg Ryan, Dennis Franz, André Braugher, Colm Feore. 
Directed by Brad Silberling. 116 minutes.
Rated PG-13, 3.5 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

The best scene in "City Of Angels" has nothing to do with the central 
romantic storyline. It takes place on a beach, where angels gather every 
morning to hear the ethereal music that accompanies the sunrise. On this 
particular morning, the otherworldly beings are joined by a former angel 
who chose to become human. As the spirits turn towards the dawn he says, 
"Oh yes, the music. I can't hear the music anymore." Then, with a look of 
glee, he exclaims "But you can't do this!" and shucks off his clothing, 
racing into the sea to catch a wave and body surf through the blue waters.
"City Of Angels" is an ambitious work, attempting to remake a 
contemplative European art film in a way that satisfies the commercial 
demands of Hollywood while maintaining the integrity of the source 
material. The effort is less than successful, but offers ample rewards 
for those willing to overlook the gooey parts. 
The film is based on Wim Wender's cult favorite "Wings Of Desire." The 
1988 West German-French production focused on angels who wander the 
streets of West Berlin, listening to the thoughts of the humans around 
them. Bedecked in long dark overcoats, the apparitions radiate an air of 
wistful dignity as they quietly discuss all they have seen, wondering 
what it would be like to be human. Towards the end of the film, one angel,
 smitten by a lonely trapeze artist, considers taking the plunge and 
becoming mortal.
Wenders' film was a somber, reflective tone poem, and "City Of Angels" 
starts off the same way, effectively establishing a lyrical feel through 
John Seale's gorgeous cinematography. The film begins with a series of 
great shots depicting angels in Los Angeles, walking on the roofs of 
buildings, sitting atop freeway signs, and perched on billboards. Using 
aerial photography to look straight down on the vast city from above, the 
film manages the near-impossible: it actually makes Los Angeles look good.
When the spirits aren't giving unseen comfort to those in pain, or 
escorting the dying to the next level of existence, they gather at the 
library to compare notes. Seth (Nicholas Cage) tells his friend Cassiel 
(André Braugher) about an extraordinary thing that happened earlier in 
the day. While watching Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) perform heart surgery, 
she looked up from her patient, gazed straight into Seth's eyes and said 
firmly "He's not going anywhere." This isn't supposed to happen and Seth 
is amazed. He's also in love.
Seth decides to become visible to the doctor, passing himself off as a 
friend of Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz,) one of Maggie's patients. 
Over the course of time, he learns that, if possessed with enough desire 
and courage, an angel can become human, but once done, the process cannot 
be reversed. 
You know what happens next, and that's the problem. After establishing a 
lilting poetic feel, "City Of Angels" takes a fateful turn away from 
"Wings Of Desire" and towards "Ghost." In the original film, the romance 
was saved until the very end and served as a nice coda to a meditative 
piece. Here, the sparks fly way too early, and the film has nowhere to go 
except to the land of Hollywood clichés. 
It's not the fault of the cast. Nicholas Cage is fine, although his deep, 
sincere doe-eyed gaze gets a little old after a while. Meg Ryan, 
insufferably cute in many of her recent films, plays it straight here and 
gives a solid performance. The supporting players are even better. 
"Homicide's" André Braugher casts a warm presence as the angel Cassiel, 
and Dennis Franz is an absolute delight as Nathaniel Messinger, a loving 
husband and father as well as an unabashed hedonist, drinking in all of 
life's pleasures. 
The problem with the latter half of "City Of Angels" is that the romance 
itself simply isn't all that interesting. When Seth and Maggie start 
behaving like animated Hallmark cards, the film takes on an air of glossy 
familiarity that makes one wish the camera would move away from the star-
crossed lovers and refocus on Messinger and Cassiel, two far more 
intriguing characters. 
Instead, the film goes straight down the Hollywood highway, complete with 
a drippy, contrived romantic climax that's just plain annoying. After 
that extremely awkward move, the film regains its footing for a suitably 
poetic closing scene, but the earlier pathos leaves a mild, but 
unpleasant aftertaste.
While the problem areas in "City Of Angels" are difficult to ignore, they 
do not negate its many pleasures. For Hollywood to attempt a work of 
spiritual poetry is rare. That they didn't quite pull it off is a shame, 
but certainly not surprising. With this film, it's easy to enjoy the good 
stuff, suffer the bad, and appreciate the effort as a whole.

After an epic like "Boogie Nights," you might expect a young
writer/director like Paul Thomas Anderson to follow it up with
something short and breezy. Instead, the 28-year-old has crafted a
wildly ambitious mosaic featuring multiple storylines, roughly 30
speaking roles and a meteorological event of biblical
proportions. "Magnolia" is a sprawling look at 24 hours in the lives
of a group of Southern Californians. Overstuffed and overwhelming, the
production is at times frustrating, but just as often exhilarating,
with several tour de force performances from its superb cast. The
ultimate compliment I can pay "Magnolia" is this: even though the film
is slightly over three hours long, I can hardly wait to see it again.
After a stylish prologue emphasizing that "strange things happen all
the time," Anderson plunges into his fractured tale of alienation and
spiritual malaise in the San Fernando Valley, introducing a vast array
of characters. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is a desperately ill man
reflecting on his failures as a husband and father. His current wife,
Linda (Julianne Moore), can't deal with his impending death. Luckily,
Earl has a nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is utterly devoted to
caring for his needs.
Earl's estranged son Frank (Tom Cruise) is a ferocious motivational
speaker, mesmerizing lost, angry men with his "Seduce and Destroy"
seminars. He augments his "Respect the Cock" philosophy with
instructional segments like "How to fake that you are a caring
person." Essentially, Frank is the guy who would teach Sex-Ed to
members of the "Fight Club."
The emotional and moral center of the movie is Jim Kurring (John
C. Reilly), a sweet, compassionate police officer who places the
importance of "doing good and helping others" above all else. Jim
meets Claudia (Melora Waters), an overstrung druggie determined to
remain alone in her despair. She touches something in Jim, who builds
the courage to ask her on a date.
Jim also has a memorable encounter with Donnie Smith (William
H. Macy), who was once a famous whiz kid on a '60s game show. Now,
Donnie works a dull job and spends his off-hours looking for love.
Getting dizzy yet? Wait, there's more. Donnie's contemporary
counterpart is young Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), a boy genius
enjoying a hot streak on a current game show. His tyrannical father
lives, both vicariously and financially, off his son and drives the
kid mercilessly. Incidentally, the host of the show is Claudia's
father, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), who has considerable
emotional baggage of his own.
If this laundry list of characters and situations looks daunting on
paper, rest assured that it is somehow more coherent on film. Although
Anderson's flamboyant camera ricochets wildly throughout his tattered
ensemble, the movie flows like some cracked symphony. Aimee Mann
provides the music and her tunes unify the desolate emotional
landscape. In one brilliant sequence, a character begins singing along
to Mann's song, "Save Me." One by one, other cast members, living and
dead, also begin singing from their various locations. The bizarre
chorus is at one strangely beautiful and achingly sad; even in unison,
these people are so very, very isolated.
Admittedly, there is too much going on in "Magnolia" and Anderson
periodically loses his footing. The father-son exchanges at the
contemporary game show are overly obvious and the director allows
Jason Robards to ham it up excessively during his latter scenes. But
the rest of the film more than makes up for its deficits. There are
scenes of stunning impact here, and the superb cast makes the
expansive screenplay shine.
Two performances in particular stand out. Tom Cruise positively
crackles as the perversely charismatic selfish-help guru. His
explosive work here almost seems like a catharsis for the restraint
demanded of him in "Eyes Wide Shut." In fact, one of his best moments
is an improvisational bit that occurs during an interview scene. At
Anderson's urging, Cruise abruptly stripped to his shorts before
delivering a sputtering erotic diatribe that is as frightening as it
is impressive.
But John C. Reilly is the heart of "Magnolia" [NOTE: An interview with
Reilly follows this review]. The superb character actor gets a chance
to be a romantic lead and carries off his part with subtlety and
charm. Reilly's idealistic officer could easily have turned mawkish,
but he keeps the man genuine, even during his lofty idealistic
speeches. Officer Jim is compassion personified, and he
single-handedly rescues the story from terminal melancholy.
Something else happens in "Magnolia," something extraordinary, but I
won't tell you about it. Suffice to say it is audacious, wondrous and
totally successful. While the same cannot be said about "Magnolia" as
a whole, I'll happily take a flawed masterpiece like this over the
more pedestrian offerings of other directors any day. "Magnolia" makes
important statements about family, self-absorption and the dangerous
direction our increasingly fragmented culture is taking, and Paul
Thomas Anderson delivers his messages with grand imagination and
daring.
You may not recognize John C. Reilly's name, but you'll never forget his face. Reilly has a great mug, with the kind of distinctive features that make him a natural for a wide variety of character roles. But in Paul Thomas Anderson's "Magnolia," Reilly is not only the film's romantic lead, but its moral center as well. The 34-year-old actor didn't realize his lofty place in the story until after the fact. "I think it's a credit to Paul that he didn't let that be a distraction to what we were doing," he explained during a recent phone interview. "He just let me focus on what this guy was going through on this particular day. So, the heart of the movie, the moral center of the movie, all that stuff, I learned in retrospect."
Reilly and Anderson first hooked up at the Sundance New Filmmakers Workshop, where upcoming filmmakers are given the chance to cast professional actors for video projects. Professional editors, acting as mentors, work with the resultant footage. Two years before shooting his first feature, "Hard Eight," Anderson attended the workshop and Reilly was his first choice from the talent pool. "I'd done a dozen or so movies at that time," said Reilly, "and he knew all of them. He was already a student of my work, so I met him and we've been really good friends since then. We immediately clicked; we were on the same wavelength. He just appreciates what I do as an actor."
A product of a rough neighborhood on Chicago's Southwest side, Reilly began performing in local theater as a child. "I was eight or nine years old and kind of hanging out with this shoplifting crowd at the time. It was kind of a rough Irish-Lithuanian working-class kind of neighborhood and there was this park with a field house where they had wood class and tap dance class and drama class. This friend of mine from grammar school said one day 'Hey, I'm going to the park to go to drama class, want to come with?' I didn't even know what drama meant, but I just loved the playfulness of it."
When I asked if the "shoplifting crowd" taunted him over going into theater, Reilly replied, "Not when I was a kid. They thought I was funny, so they enjoyed that I did that. They were just kind of amused by it. Now, in high school there was a little bit of stigma. 'Oh, there's the play people,' you know? But by that point I'd been doing it for ten years, so I didn't really care what people thought. I went to a boy's Catholic high school in Chicago and I would go to the girl's Catholic high school to do plays." With a chuckle, he added, "So I'd be doing like two or three plays at a time and I thought I was just the luckiest guy in the world, to be surrounded by all of these Catholic school girls, doing 'The Pajama Game' and stuff like that."
Reilly's affinity for acting turned into a way of life. He was accepted at the prestigious Goodman School of Drama and went on to perform in "The Grapes of Wrath" on Broadway. His film career began as a Vietnam War recruit in Brian De Palma's "Casualties of War." Reilly has since appeared in 21 other films, including all three of Anderson's works. He enjoys being a part of the director's acting ensemble. "Paul is incredibly loyal, he finds the people he likes and your relationship just gets deeper the more you work with him. Also, he doesn't have a lot of patience for explaining his vision to people. So if he works with the same people over and over again, you develop a kind of shorthand. Like he and I, at this point, it's almost like we communicate on the set with a series of grunts and hand signals. It saves a lot of time."
Of his three films with Paul Thomas Anderson, Reilly holds a special place for "Hard Eight." "I've got a soft spot in my heart for the first one," he said. "Just because of the simpleness, and how quiet that movie is. I think 'Boogie Nights' is certainly the most fun and I have such fond memories of it, that crazy summer when we shot it. And 'Magnolia,' to tell you the truth, as much as I love the movie and am so moved by it I've seen it three times and the last time I watched it, it just broke my heart too much. It was like 'Oh, I need to take a little time off before I see this one again.' It's just so heartbreaking, a lot of it."
The extended family created by Anderson is now a mainstay in Reilly's life. Starting next month, he begins a five-month run with his "Boogie Nights" buddy Philip Seymour Hoffman on Broadway in "True West." "It's a major revival of the play," Reilly said enthusiastically, "I actually was the first guy in on this one. I met the director and was really impressed. He has a strong point of view on how to present the play and so, even though it's a challenging part and a lot of work, I was ready. They wanted me to do it and said 'Who do you think could play your brother' and the first name out of my mouth was Philip Seymour Hoffman." Reilly convinced Hoffman to meet with the director, everything clicked, and rehearsals start January 10th.
The idea of repeating the same lines for five months sounds daunting, to say the least, but Reilly is excited at the prospect. "It recharges you. It makes you a better actor. It's kind of like the Olympics for an actor. The audiences are always different. Just when you think you can predict what an audience will do, they surprise you. 
"It's also very freeing," he continued. "After doing a lot of movies you end up feeling kind of like an employee, although that's certainly not the case with Paul, because Paul is very special in the way he lets us go off and interpret things. But with a lot of directors you're in service of some greater thing. Theater is different. You go through a sort of organic process in rehearsal and make some collective decisions about how things are going to go. Then you're turned loose on stage for two hours and it's really exhilarating. I love to play with an audience and, from the time I was eight until the time I was 22, all I did was plays, so this feels like returning to what I'm best at."
This summer, Reilly costars with George Clooney and another ensemble friend, "Boogie Nights" star Mark Wahlberg, in the highly anticipated film, "The Perfect Storm," about the fishermen of the Andrea Gail and their tragic encounter with the largest storm to hit the North Atlantic this century. "We tried to be as sensitive as we could be to the memory of them," he explained. "We just tried to portray the fishermen in a truthful way. That will be the best testament to what their lives were about. These guys all really loved their way of life." Reilly acknowledged that the movie takes a few dramatic liberties in terms of drama and interpretations of the characters. "In some ways it's a combination of a bunch of different stories of fishermen from the area. All the things that happen in the movie really happened, they just all didn't happen on this one trip." A fishing boat captain who worked on the Andrea Gail for many years was present on the set everyday. "He kept us tuned in t!
!
!
o the reality," Reilly said quietly.
Being able to work with Mark Wahlberg again was a real treat for the actor. "I love Mark. He just gets better and better. He's a natural. We became friends on 'Boogie Nights,' we really hit it off. Mark also comes from a less than glamorous background; he came from some pretty tough streets himself." Like many, Reilly is amazed at how quickly Wahlberg made the transition from pop culture icon to serious actor. "He has a natural ability to find the truth. He came into 'Boogie Nights' and I didn't know who the hell he was I knew about all the pop culture stuff that you mentioned, but I didn't know if the guy could pull it off acting wise, so I was a little bit skeptical when we started. But he was right in there, I couldn't believe it! Because I go crazy when I'm improvising and stuff, and it can be a challenge if you're not ready or not willing to jump in there as well, and Mark just jumped right in. He was so right there. We had a blast on that movie. I'm just so proud of Mar!

k. He's really good in 'The Perfect Storm' too. He's from the area, around Boston, so can really relate to the whole way of life." 
As for John C. Reilly's next collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson, all the actor knows is that it's coming soon. "He gives these little scheduling hints. He said, 'You're doing this play with Phil, huh? When does it end?' I said 'End of May or June' and he said 'Perfect!' That's the only clue I've gotten so far."

Leonard Shelby can't make new memories. He shares this fact with each
person he meets, then shares it all over again the next time he sees
them, because he doesn't remember the previous encounter. Then he shares
it all over again the next time he sees them, because he doesn't
remember the previous encounter. Leonard's long term memory is fine, but
brain damage destroyed his ability to retain anything new. So he lives
in a perpetual state of now, propelled by one overwhelming need.
Leonard Shelby is on a blood quest. His injury occurred during an attack
that took the life of his wife, the last event he remembers. Leonard is
determined to find and exact revenge on the man that raped and murdered
her.
Leonard Shelby is methodical. A former insurance investigator, he
devises methods to work around his disability. He takes Polaroid
snapshots of significant people and places and writes notes to himself
on the photos. When he decides a piece of information is vital, he
tattoos it on his body. Leonard is a walking notepad of cues and clues,
of grief and hate.
Leonard Shelby is not working alone. A bartender named Natalie helps
him. He keeps her annotated photo with him at all times. The other
significant figure in Leonard's minute by minute existence is Teddy, who
pops up everywhere to offer advice.
"Memento" presents Leonard's story in reverse, beginning at the end and
jerking, one extended scene at a time, backwards in time to the start.
This presentation style works very well, showing us a consequence and
then the action that preceded it. Peeling away a layer at a time, the
genesis of his perpetual nightmare gradually becomes clear. To us, that
is, but not Leonard.
Leonard Shelby has a tattoo on his hand that says, "Remember Sammy
Jankis." Sammy also suffered from a lack of short-term memory and
Leonard was the agent assigned to his case. The events in Sammy's life
are intercut throughout the film in black and white fragments that move
in standard chronological order. There is something for Leonard to learn
from this.
By using two sets of timelines, writer and director Christopher Nolan
throws us into a state of confusion; nothing as severe as Leonard's, but
enough to make us relate. Leonard's situation poses some disturbing
questions about the relationship between memory and one's sense of self.
Who hasn't experienced discomfort trying to recall a forgotten fact? Who
hasn't tried to cover a small sense of panic when they bump into a
person they vaguely remember, but can't quite place?
Then there is Alzheimer's disease, which terrifies us. We watch
afflicted loved ones suffer as the information they hold most precious
slips away, throwing them into a nightmarish state of continual
disorientation, and we fear the same may someday happen to us. It forces
us to look at what constitutes identity. Are we the sum of our memories
and, if so, how many memories can a soul lose before the sense of self
disappears as well?
"Memento" is an ingenuous, disquieting thriller aided by unusual rhythms
and a first-rate cast. In the lead role, Aussie actor Guy Pearce, best
known as the straight arrow cop in "L.A. Confidential," adds the perfect
shadings to his character. His Leonard retains the investigative skills
from his pre-accident days and, as any good detective would do, hides
his ignorance with a mask of knowing confidence. Leonard is at once a
grieving husband, a lost child, a dogged sleuth and an obsessed threat,
and the underrated Pearce effectively conveys all of those qualities.
Carrie-Ann Moss, who burst into the public eye as a cool warrior in "The
Matrix," is striking as Natalie, revealing a bit more of the complex
woman with each new scene. Best remembered as the pesky insurance
salesman in "Groundhog Day," Stephen Tobolowsky is credible and touching
as memory-loss victim Sammy Jankis. In the pivotal role of Teddy, Joe
Pantoliano glides from sincere to smarmy and back again with the
greatest of ease. Pantoliano has played similar types in everything from
"The Matrix" to "The Sopranos," but he remains a pleasure to watch.
Funny thing about this guy: No matter what he is doing, he always
appears to be popping his teeth on a stick of chewing gum.
Like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Matrix," "Memento" is a strongly acted
and neatly constructed puzzle movie, but the comparison ends there.
Whether viewed as an existential exercise or just a snappy thriller,
this is a true original. In a year that has so far brought a numbing
collection of vapid big screen retreads, it stands out even more.

"15 Minutes" is notable for two things. One is a truly harrowing fire
scene and the other will have to remain a secret. All I can say is that
midway through the film something very surprising happens, something
I've only seen happen in one other movie, and I can't tell you the name
of that film, either. Please forgive me for being so cryptic.
Incidentally, the crow flies south at midnight.
What "15 Minutes" will not be remembered for is originality or finesse.
The violent thriller addresses celebrity culture and media
irresponsibly, themes already (and far better) covered in films ranging
from "Network" to "Natural Born Killers." Director John Herzfeld ("2
Days in the Valley"), working from his own written-in-crayons
screenplay, offers a strutting tabloid newsman who shouts, "If it
bleeds, it leads!" and an immigrant killer who says things like, "I love
America! No one is responsible for what they do!" Subtle, eh?
The title of the film, of course, refers to the beaten-into-the-ground
Andy Warhol prediction that, in the future, everybody will be famous for
15 minutes.
On a guilty pleasure level, "15 Minutes" has its moments. I found the
lurid tone, contrived situations and overwrought dialogue good for a few
cheap laughs. Remember though, that I didn't have to pay for a ticket.
If you're preparing to spend hard-earned money on a movie, for God's
sake, seek out a quality production and don't settle for this sort of
cheese.
The story follows Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg
Taktarov), a pair of thugs new to America shores. Within minutes of
their arrival in New York, Oleg, who is such a film freak that he
introduces himself as Frank Capra, steals a pricey video camera from a
Times Square shop. The big man with little boy eyes plans to record
everything that happens to him and his friend, believing that his
"movie" will bring him fame and fortune.
Oleg's documentary takes a dark turn when the pair pays a visit to some
former criminal partners. Emil learns that the money from a bank robbery
has been spent, then murders his ex-colleagues and torches their place
in an attempt to cover up the homicides, all while Oleg keeps filming.
Ah, but there's a witness. Daphne (Vera Farmiga), a jittery hairdresser,
sees it all and, unfortunately, the men see her.
Enter the Americans. Homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro)
is a beloved New York celebrity, thanks to frequent TV news coverage. So
popular is he that Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), the preening host of
the tabloid series "Top Story," often gathers a camera crew and
accompanies Eddie on busts. Due to the nature of the crime,
just-plain-folks arson expert Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) ends up
reluctantly teamed with Eddie. A wary mentor-mentee relationship
develops between the two as they try to find the witness and snag the
killers.
Meanwhile, Emil comes up with a plan. He will continue to let Oleg tape
his monstrous acts and sell the snuff footage for broadcast by some
unscrupulous news organization (guess who?). Then he will allow himself
to be caught, plead insanity due to poor self-esteem and childhood abuse
and get a spot in a cushy mental hospital. After a time, he will be
"cured" and released, enabling him to cash in on his fame, safe from
further prosecution due to the double jeopardy provision in our legal
system.
Oh, what a sick world we live in. Thank goodness we have
writer-directors like John Herzfeld to decry a culture that wallows in
the lurid display of violence by creating a movie that wallows in the
lurid display of violence.
To their credit, I guess, the cast plays the hokum straight. Robert De
Niro is fine in an unchallenging role, hindered only by a needless "Taxi
Driver" style scene that has him staring into a mirror while practicing
what to say on an important date. As usual, Edward Burns is annoying as
hell, using his standard "my underwear is too tight" voice to whine and
shout his way through the movie. In the role of media whore, Kelsey
Grammer comes off like Ted Baxter on cocaine. A number of other
well-known faces pop up in cameo roles without making much of an
impression.
The bad guys are better. As Emil, Karel Roden overacts in an
appropriately villainous fashion, while Oleg Taktarov steals the show as
the would-be filmmaker, managing to be threatening and childlike at
once. Watch this guy closely  he has the potential for greatness.
That, by the way, is the only time you will ever hear the word greatness
in connection with "15 Minutes."

The most surprising thing about the we-must-lose-our-virginity-before-we-
graduate comedy, "American Pie," is what goes on beneath the burlesque. 
How often do you see a film of this type where one of the male leads 
tells his buddies that he is tired of the endless chatter about getting 
laid, adding that he's going to visit with a young woman because "at 
least she knows how to talk about something besides sex." What a 
refreshing statement to hear. 
I laughed at most of the raunchy gags in "American Pie," but found them 
less shocking than promised by the advance hype. Yes, the film includes a 
live Internet peep show, semen-laced beer drinking, jokes about oral sex 
techniques, a lengthy diarrhea segment and the already infamous shot of a 
guy screwing an apple pie, but after "There's Something About Mary," 
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," and "South Park: Bigger, Longer 
and Uncut," there was nothing here I haven't seen before. 
Well, except for the sex with dessert scene. Speaking of which, it may 
seem utterly ridiculous to think practically about this sort of thing, 
but I couldn't help wondering exactly how this guy expected to 
successfully masturbate with an apple pie. I mean, where's the friction, 
for Pete's Sake?
Most of the comedy in "American Pie" revolves around the embarrassment 
that comes with sex; from being caught in a compromising position to the 
awkwardness of the act itself. Fair enough, sexuality is a funny subject. 
But how about a little internal logic? Too many punchlines depend on 
situations that would never have occurred had the involved characters 
simply locked their door. While everyone fears public humiliation, 
teenagers are even more sensitive about potentially embarrassing 
situations, often to the point of paranoia. A teenager locks the door 
before masturbating in his room. Hell, a teenager locks the door before 
listening to CDs in his room. And I guarantee you, if a kid decided to 
have a sexual liaison with baked goods, he would not do so in broad 
daylight in his parent's kitchen. Jokes work better in at least a semi-
realistic context and, too often, "American Pie" forgets that crucial 
point.
Still, the film is funny. The young cast (particularly pie-boy Jason 
Biggs) displays a nice gift for comedy and "SCTV" veteran Eugene Levy is 
a riot as the ultimate understanding father. But I enjoyed the 
relationships in the film more than the rude and crude shenanigans. Some 
of the pairings have a disarming, and very welcome, sweetness. When 
lacrosse player Oz (Chris Klein) sets his sights on young Heather (Mena 
Suvari), he tries to feign a sensitive side to win a place in her bed. 
Along the way, he discovers that he likes the man he is pretending to be. 
The romantic story arc of Oz and Heather is the heart of the movie, 
thanks in large part to the magic of the actors. Chris Klein (Matthew 
Broderick's candidate in "Election") is bound for stardom, with his clean 
cut good looks complimented by an open, unaffected screen presence and 
Mena Suvani, who shares a passing resemblance to Heather Graham, has the 
rare ability to project strength and vulnerability at the same time.
Natasha Lyonne, so wonderful in "The Slums of Beverly Hills," makes the 
most of her much smaller role here. As Jessica, she dispenses advice on 
all matters related to sex and romance, while being the only character 
not in a relationship. Lyonne is a terrific actor with a great earthy 
quality, effectively painting Jessica as a young woman using a persona of 
frankness to avoid real intimacy. She left me wanting to know more about 
what makes Jessica tick, quite an accomplishment in this context. 
Within the generally strong cast, there are a few duds. As Stifler, the 
mandatory sexist jock, newcomer Seann W. Scott looks and sounds like a 
junior Jim Carrey, giving a one-dimensional, leering performance that 
never elevates his character above archetype status. Chris Owen, who was 
good as an outcast intellectual in "October Sky," is annoying here as a 
smarmy geek with delusions of grandeur. 
"American Pie" succeeds because of the winning efforts of most of its 
cast, coupled with deft editing, especially during the aforementioned 
Internet peep show scene, which turns a retread gag from "Revenge of the 
Nerds" into a genuinely funny set piece. And, even though teen sex 
comedies have been done to death, I found it impossible to resist 
laughing when a young man studies a homemade sex manual that includes a 
picture of a vibrator accompanied by the heading, "Know Your Enemy." 
"American Pie" is not as shocking as it desperately wants to be, but when 
it works, it works very well.

A funny thing happened this Thanksgiving. A new slam-bang action movie
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger opened and nobody seemed to notice. How
could such an oversight occur? Perhaps the barrage of hype for "How the
Grinch Stole Christmas" was so intense that it hypnotized filmgoers.
Perhaps some fumes from the 1999 stink bomb, "End of Days," lingered
around the big man's name. Or could it be that Arnold has simply entered
the twilight of his film career?
I hope not. Oh sure, he can't act and he's a Republican, but how can you
not love the big lug? Arnold Schwarzenegger is the embodiment of the
American dream. A scrawny kid from a tiny European village achieves fame
and fortune as a bodybuilder, then announces his intent to become a
movie star. Everyone snickers at his ambitions, his cartoonish bulk, his
gap-toothed grin and, of course, that accent. But Ah-nuld ignores the
naysayers, becomes the most popular actor on the entire planet and
marries into the Kennedy family. My God, you couldn't make up a story
like that!
Of course, time spares no living creature, and the years are beginning
to show on this Sequoia of a man. Schwarzenegger still does his action
hero shtick in "The 6th Day," but his movements are more deliberate,
betraying a certain creakiness. Even the bravado is muted. This time
around, his most famous catch phrase gets amended as his character
states "I might be back."
The aging of Schwarzenegger fits perfectly into "The 6th Day." Beneath
its sci-fi trappings, the film addresses mortality and is far more
thought provoking than one might expect.
Set in the near future, the story revolves around cloning. Arnold plays
husband and father Adam Gibson, who runs a charter helicopter business
with his partner Hank (Michael Rapaport). Shortly after consenting to a
high-tech fingerprinting and eyesight testing procedure for a new
client, Adam swaps a piloting gig with Hank without informing the
passengers. Later, Adam returns home, only to spot his exact duplicate
inside the house with his wife and daughter.
Adam learns that he was mistakenly cloned by cronies of genetic
engineering tycoon Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). While cloning of
lower animals is allowed, the practice is strictly prohibited for
humans. Since Adam is walking evidence of Drucker's lawbreaking, the
pilot must be eliminated, leading to the sort of action expected in a
Schwarzenegger movie.
As entertainment, "The 6th Day" falls in the middle of the Ah-nuld
oeuvre, not as good as the "Terminator" films and "Total Recall," but
better than a lot of his outings. Although the cloning particulars are
extremely far fetched, most of the other near-future trappings seem
refreshingly credible, not to mention fun. Hank has a holographic
girlfriend so accommodating ("I've recorded all your favorite sporting
programs," she coos, while straddling him and his sensory-stimulating
love chair) that he has no desire for a real woman. Drivers can turn
over the vehicle commands to programs that drive a pre-planned route.
One of the Adams gleefully sneaks a stogie in the garage, defying a
national ban on smoking. A police station allows suspects access to
virtual-reality court-appointed attorneys and psychiatrists.
The futuristic stuff is a kick, but the notions raised by the cloning
theme are much more interesting. In the story, an individual's memories
and personality can be transferred to their fully-grown cloned body,
which presents Adam with an ethical quandary. Initially, he wants to
kill his clone, but then reconsiders. Even if Adam 2 is a duplicate,
does that make him deserving of death? Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall),
the scientist behind the process, faces his own dilemma when his gravely
ill wife, Katherine (Wanda Cannon) begs him to stop cloning her and just
let nature take its course.
I left with a number of questions. What if this procedure was possible
in our world? Would I participate? Would downloading the contents of my
brain into a new container let me attain a practical immortality, or
would my soul get lost in the transfer, leaving a separate lifeform that
only thinks it is I? Even if I could be sure that my soul would survive
the transfer, should I do it? Yes, the procedure would allow my
continued earthly survival, but what about the possibility of life after
death? I would never be able to find out if our souls reunite with loved
ones on a different plane of existence.
Pretty heady stuff for an Ah-nuld movie, eh? Here's a final (and
frightening) thought. What if cloning is like photocopying and, each
time you make a copy of a copy, the quality level goes down? And what
if, at the upper echelons of our society, cloning has been going on for
decades, with inferior fourth or fifth generation clones walking the
streets right now? This, my friends, would finally explain George W.
Bush, who recently claimed, in the type of phrasing that you would
expect from a fifth generation clone, that people were
"misunderestimating him." Think about it.

I hate assigning star ratings to movies. The underlying implication, that 
filmgoers are too lazy to actually read a review, is insulting and 
besides that, assigning stars is a pain. When a film is clearly and 
consistently good ("The Truman Show") or an obvious dud ("Meet The 
Deedles") the process is easy. It's those in-between films, the ones with 
both great and dreadful moments, that really make the process difficult. 
Which brings us to "Godzilla."
After being subjected to a staggering amount of hype for over a year, 
it's easy to forget that "Godzilla" is, after all,  just a monster movie. 
Although the genre has produced a few undeniable classics, such as "King 
Kong" and "Jaws," for the most part, monster movies remain guilty 
pleasures. You enter the theater prepared to suffer through long 
stretches of dull plotting and silly dialogue in exchange for a few 
really cool fight scenes with a big, bad-ass monster. Although I haven't 
seen the original "Godzilla," an Americanized version of the 1954 
Japanese film "Gojira," since my childhood, I clearly remember how 
thrilling the monster was, and that the rest of the film was as ponderous 
as Raymond Burr during his "Ironside" days. 
The new "Godzilla" is a lot like that. In the hands of Dean Devlin and 
Roland Emmerich, the team responsible for "Independence Day," "Godzilla" 
is an absolute hoot when the creature is onscreen, and pretty bad when it 
isn't. The film's slogan is "Size Does Matter." Wrong. Devlin and 
Emmerich's sloppy, sprawling film reinforces another old axiom, that size 
doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts. The boys have 
whipped up a great looking monster and the battle scenes are terrific, 
but they don't have a clue when it comes to plotting, pacing and logic. 
Of course, despite the film's many flaws, I still plan to see it again as 
soon as possible. That's how nifty the creature effects are.
The story is very simple. Godzilla appears. A lot of movie archetypes 
with conflicting motives chase him. New York gets trashed as the military 
battles the monster. Just when you think it's over, something else 
happens. Just when you think it's over again, something else happens. The 
end. Well, until the sequel.
Over the course of Godzilla's long career, the monster changed from 
villain to hero and the movies became incredibly campy. Thankfully, 
Devlin and Emmerich avoid the cheese factor, playing things straight in 
terms of the creature. The film's humor, both intentional and 
unintentional, comes from the humans, not Godzilla. Neither hero nor 
villain, Godzilla simply behaves like an animal. A very, very large 
animal.
As for the look, forget about stunt men in rubber suits. This Godzilla 
actually looks like a giant lizard, thanks to some killer special effects.
 Lithe and agile, Godzilla moves convincingly, with a real sense of 
weight, bulk and power. It travels so quickly that firing military troops 
keep missing, inadvertently destroying almost as much of New York as the 
monster. Scenes of the creature racing through the city are great fun, a 
reward for all the phony looking monsters we've endured in past films.
Unfortunately, endurance is still a factor. In order to see Godzilla in 
all of it's glory, we have to suffer through long stretches of inane 
filler material, with a talented cast forced to spout a lot of hokey 
dialogue. Matthew Broderick is the idealistic young scientist in the 
center of things. Maria Pitillo annoys as a conniving reporter (in movies,
 is there any other kind?) and Broderick's ex-girlfriend, weighing the 
film down with a time-consuming, totally unnecessary love story. Hank 
Azaria has his moments as a gonzo photographer, although his character is 
laden with relationship baggage as well. Actually, only two cast members 
really get a chance to shine. Jean Reno has a powerful presence as a 
French agent pursuing Godzilla, and "NewsRadio's" Vicki Lewis adds 
welcome bite to a minor role as a scientist. 
The rest of the film is peopled with cartoons, a fat, reactionary mayor 
(named Ebert, the filmmakers' little thumbs down at the famed critic,) a 
self-absorbed TV anchorman, a soldier in way over his head, etc., etc. If 
Devlin and Emmerich want to truly become masters of "event" movies, they 
need to learn how to focus on the event instead of tired subplots and 
clichéd, superfluous characters. A little more attention to internal 
logic wouldn't hurt either. For example, the impact of an exciting chase 
scene is lessened by the ludicrous notion that a cab could outrun 
Godzilla.  
Ultimately, your tolerance of all the crap in "Godzilla" will depend on 
how much of a monster fan you are.  As for me, despite it's lumbering 
storyline, terrible pacing and disposable characters, I still had fun. 
Now how do you assign stars to that?

Rated R,   * out of ***** stars
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

The rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images. The 
tinkling Christmas tree bell in "It's A Wonderful Life."  Bogie's speech 
at the airport in "Casablanca." Little Elliott's flying bicycle, 
silhouetted by the moon in "E.T." And now, "Starship Troopers" director 
Paul Verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories 
forever: Doogie Houser doing a Vulcan mind meld with a giant slug.
"Starship Troopers," loosely based on the Robert Heinlein novel, is the 
story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects. In the 
hands of Verhoeven, the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most 
astonishingly bad films ever made, a monument to inept filmmaking on a 
colossal scale. To put it simply, it's a bug bomb.
In "Robocop" and "Total Recall," Verhoeven displayed a gift for creating 
an entertaining mix of violence, special effects and social satire, and 
"Starship Troopers" starts off in similar fashion, with a tongue-in-cheek 
futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise. Things go downhill 
fast, though, as we meet our heroes, a group of Buenos Aires teens 
preparing to graduate from high school. Inexplicably, Johnny Rico, Carmen 
Ibenez, Dizzy Flores and Xander Barcalow  are played by square-jawed 
Anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a Mountain Dew 
commercial. 
It's a veritable "Alpha Centuri 90210" as we watch the love-smitten teens 
squabble in the name of love. Michael Ironside plays their teacher, who 
waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic 
responsibilities. Eventually, the kids join the military, with dreams of 
glory in their addled little minds. One of their classmates, Carl Jenkins 
("Doogie Houser's" Neil Patrick Harris,) snags a job in military 
intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities. He displays his 
gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his Mother's leg.
A long, dull boot camp sequence follows, enlivened only by an extended 
coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the 
"Showgirls" director's camera roams over their buff bodies. Finally, a 
full hour into the film, the war finally starts and we meet the enemy. 
The bugs hail from Klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores 
into space. They attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly 
plasma blasts from their rears. Yes, incredible as it seems, the bugs 
actually kill with cosmic farts.
A phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer 
animated insects and the results are mixed at best.  Sweeping distant 
shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive 
and scary, but the close-ups are a different matter. The insects have an 
odd, artificial look, like origami creations with a mottled plastic 
coating. The attack scenes are intensely violent, as one would expect 
from Verhoeven, but the overall look is too phony to generate any real 
tension. While the action is frantic, the military strategy, wildly 
illogical even by Hollywood standards, grows tiresome quickly. Verhoeven 
tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage, but 
the faux-jingoistic scenes of children "doing their part for the war 
effort" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for 
the long stretches of sheer dreck. 
One can only guess what Paul Verhoeven was trying to do here. His 
customary one part satire, two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of 
whack, and most of the film just flounders. In "Showgirls" fashion, some 
scenes are almost bad enough to be good. An intergalactic kegger party, 
with Jake Busey playing "Dixie" on a green Plexiglas fiddle, has a 
certain bizarre appeal. A sex scene between two of the teens achieves a 
smarmy charm, enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a 
fatal jab from a bug, but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying. 
"It's okay," she gasps, "I got to have you!" And then, of course, there's 
Doogie's mind meld with a bug.
It's possible that Verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the 
era of the original novel. Heinlein's pre-"Stranger In A Strange Land" 
books were aimed at adolescent males, and "Starship Troopers" has the 
antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi. The one 
cityscape shown is a Jetsons-like gleaming metropolis, with flying cars 
whizzing past an obvious matte painting. The hairstyles are retro too, 
straight from the Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello school of fashion. 
Ultimately, Verhoeven's motives are irrelevant. He has produce a 
gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire. It 
even fails to be an entertaining bad movie. Avoid "Starship Troopers" at 
all costs.

Review for Con Air (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
Fro more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Every summer Hollywood rolls out the latest batch of mega-movies, upping 
the ante each year with better special effects and bigger explosions. 
After months of promotional bombardment, we dutifully trot to the 
theaters, becoming more jaded with each cinematic thrill ride. What a 
headache it must be for the West Coast big boys as they try to figure out 
how to top themselves. 
For Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of the utterly superficial and enormously 
successful flicks TOP GUN, CRIMSON TIDE and THE ROCK, the answer is 
simple. Hire a group of extremely well-respected character actors, give 
them large injections of testosterone, take a story that barely even nods 
at credibility, then press the accelerator to the floor for two hours and 
blow the hell out of anything that moves. The result is extremely 
entertaining and utterly vapid; a hoot of a summer movie that succeeds 
because of its own excess. To paraphrase an old Cheech and Chong bit, CON 
AIR is shit, but it's good shit. 
CON AIR works because the filmmakers are acutely aware of just how 
ridiculous their movie is, and they let us in on the joke. Early in the 
action/thriller about a group of convicts who hijack a prison transport 
plane, we meet the bad boys. As each convict makes his grandiose entrance,
 reproachful prison officials read their names and stats in the same 
fashion announcers use during Pro-Wrestling introductions. There's 
Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames,) murderer and Black militant. Johnny 23 (Danny 
Trejo,) a serial rapist who adds another heart-shaped tattoo for each new 
victim. Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi,) a soft-spoken Hannilbal Lecter 
clone, and a host of other larger-than-life monsters. The group's leader 
is Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom, a glib psychopath played with extreme gusto 
by John Malkovich. Alone, any of these characters would make a memorable 
villain. Together, they create a riotous sense of overkill. Watching 
these guys is like visiting a Manson Family reunion.
Now for the good guys. A pumped-up Nicholas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a 
celebrated Army Ranger finishing a prison term for killing a man while 
defending his wife. Cage anchors the film beautifully, using his RAISING 
ARIZONA accent and a single-minded fixation on doing the right thing at 
any cost to create a corn-pone Superman. Cage's Poe has the deadly 
earnestness of Gregory Peck and the fighting skills of Bruce Lee on 
steroids. The combination is absurd, but set next to the planeload of 
scenery-gnashing bad guys, he seems positively normal. While Poe tries to 
sabotage the hijacking in order to assist a friend and rescue a female 
prison guard, corrections officials on the ground work on damage control. 
Colm Meany, the great dough-faced Celtic actor from STAR TREK:TNG and 
DEEP SPACE NINE, plays a blustery D.E.A. agent battling John Cusack, a 
liberal U.S. Marshall trying to use reason to defuse the situation. 
Eventually, Cusack joins forces with Cage for the requisite battle to the 
bitter end with Malkovich and his cronies.
Along the way, CON AIR lobs a staggering barrage of violence, explosions, 
stunts, and fight scenes, including a whale of a set piece involving a 
sports car. The pace is frenetic, and could have easily become enervating 
were it not for the crisp, witty dialogue. As silly as CON AIR's story is,
 the script is sharp, with clever one-liners judiciously placed 
throughout the action. Cage, Cusack and Malkovich are particularly adept 
at delivering wisecracks at just the right moments.
CON AIR's combination of over-the-top action and off-the-wall humor works 
well for most of the film. Bruckheimer doesn't know when to quit though, 
and drags things out a wee bit too long, with a gratuitous battle in Las 
Vegas. As a former resident of Las Vegas, I'm delighted with Hollywood's 
fixation on blowing up the town, but CON AIR's Vegas battle comes several 
minutes after a scene that easily could have served as the climax of the 
film. There really was no need for yet another battle and besides, MARS 
ATTACKS blew up Las Vegas much better. 
I've avoided giving many of the particulars from CON AIR because it's 
much more fun to see this sort of thing yourself. If you're looking for a 
film of substance, avoid this machismo-fest at all costs. If, however, 
you want to see a hyper-violent, funny, patently absurd movie virtually 
intoxicated on its own cheekiness, try CON AIR. You'll never mistake it 
for art, but as far as summer movies go, this is a pretty effective 
thrill machine.

Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)
Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, Richard 
Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, Vanessa Lee Chester. Directed by Steven 
Spielberg.
Rated PG-13, *** stars (out of *****). 
Remember when JURASSIC PARK first came out? Most critics panned the movie,
 stating that while the dinosaurs were spectacular, the film itself was 
flimsy stuff, sorely lacking in plot and characterization. Of course, 
they failed to realize that we weren't particularly concerned with plot 
or characterization. We just wanted to see a movie overflowing with big-
ass, realistic-looking, living, breathing dinosaurs. JURASSIC PARK 
delivered the dinosaurs and we flocked to the theaters, making it the 
largest grossing film of all time. 
Well, it's four years later and the inevitable sequel, THE LOST WORLD: 
JURASSIC PARK, has arrived. So what are we looking for this time? Most of 
the people I spoke with said the same thing. More big-ass dinosaurs and 
non-stop action. Director Steven Spielberg, no dummy when it comes to 
anticipating audience expectations, has crafted a film that gives us 
relentless action and scores of incredibly realistic dinosaurs. While the 
film suffers from the been-there, done-that syndrome, and has some major 
structural problems, as far as sequels go, THE LOST WORLD is one of the 
better ones.
Here's the premise. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) really had two 
dinosaur islands. The one we saw in the original, and a second, where the 
dinosaurs were actually bred, and now live in uncontrolled ecological 
balance. Two groups of humans go to the island. The good ones, 
reluctantly led by Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum,) merely want to study 
the creatures. The bad ones want to hunt the dinosaurs for a new Jurassic 
Park, ready to open in San Diego. In short order, of course, all hell 
breaks loose and everyone scrambles madly about, trying to avoid becoming 
Dinosaur Chow.
THE LOST WORLD wastes no time getting to the action. Following the 
obligatory teaser and ten minutes of squabbling between Goldblum and 
Attenborough, the film whips out the lizards in grand fashion. The 
dinosaurs look significantly better than in the original; so good, in 
fact, that it's easy to imagine that the filmmakers somehow got their 
hands on real dinosaurs. Come to think of it, we've been reading news 
stories about real-life cloning successes for months now. Steven 
Spielberg is an incredibly rich man. Do you suppose that maybe he used 
his financial resources tooh, never mind. I'm getting so cute here that 
I'm actually annoying myself. Time to get back to business.
The thrills come fast and furious in THE LOST WORLD. Early in the film 
there is a spectacular Tyrannosaurus Rex attack, leading to an extended, 
extremely intense scene that leaves Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) 
dangling over a huge cliff, separated from the rocky surf hundreds of 
feet below only by a single pane of glass that splinters further and 
further in torturous fashion. The scene is totally gripping and one of 
the best set pieces in the film. 
As for the acting, Jeff Goldblum, promoted from secondary comic relief 
figure in the first film to leading man, handles his role well, leaping 
about in heroic fashion while tossing off caustic one-liners (when 
Attenborough assures Goldblum that he has learned from his mistakes, 
Goldblum spits back "Yeah, now you're making all new mistakes.") Vince 
Vaughn, the breakout performer from last years wonderful comedy SWINGERS, 
creates a distinct, compelling presence as Nick Van Owen, an 
environmental activist working for the good guys. Vanessa Lee Chester has 
some nice moments as Kelly, Goldblum's daughter who joins the expedition 
as a stowaway. The rest of the cast are generic event-movie archetypes, 
chewing scenery until the dinosaurs chew them. 
That's one of the problems with THE LOST WORLD. In JURASSIC PARK there 
were relatively few characters, allowing the audience a chance to get to 
know them and to care about their fates. THE LOST WORLD has so many 
people swarming over the island that it's hard to keep track of who's who,
 let alone become emotionally involved with them. When one character gets 
pulling in half by two dinosaurs, the audience reaction is "Cool!", which 
says something very good about the special effects and something very bad 
about the screenplay. 
The biggest problem with THE LOST WORLD is it's climax. A Tyrannosaurus 
Rex gets loose in San Diego and goes on a rampage. Things begin well, as 
the T-Rex roams through dark suburban backyards. Things get better as the 
monster goes berserk in the city streets, shredding a gas station and 
several vehicles. And then, just when you're ready for the big final 
confrontation between the raging beast and humankind, everything gets 
resolved, way too quickly and in a very anticlimactic way. For an action-
packed film, the climax simply doesn't have enough action.
Regardless of its flaws, THE LOST WORLD fares better than most sequels. 
Its fast pace helps to minimize the sense of deja vu, and the dinosaurs 
are absolutely superb. I was frustrated with JURASSIC PARK for not 
showing any pterodactyls. In one of THE LOST WORLD's best shots, several 
of the flying reptiles soar through the sky. One lands close to the 
camera and slowly stretches out until its wings are fully extended, with 
sunlight glinting through the membranes. At that moment I realized that 
for hard core dinosaur-watchers, THE LOST WORLD is as good as it gets.   

Title
Review for Conspiracy Theory (1997)
CONSPIRACY THEORY
Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, Patrick Stewart
Rated R, Three stars (out of a possible five.)
"Conspiracy Theory" is a puzzle box. This entertaining, engaging and 
thoroughly loopy thriller is full of surprises. It's a rare, and quite 
refreshing, treat to watch a Hollywood film and actually be kept off 
guard almost all the way through. Richard Donner, director of the "Lethal 
Weapon" series, reunites with Mel Gibson for this tale of a paranoid New 
York cab driver who stumbles into a great deal of trouble. Gibson plays 
Jerry Fletcher, a deeply disturbed man who overwhelms his passengers with 
tales of bizarre conspiracies. 
According to Fletcher, militia groups are actually U.N. troops, the 
Vietnam War was fought over a bar bet between Howard Hughes and Aristotle 
Onassis, and filmmaker Oliver Stone is really an government agent in 
charge of disseminating disinformation (actually, there may be something 
to that one). Fletcher publishes a newsletter called Conspiracy Theory, 
which has only five subscribers ("I think it's because of the economy", 
he sheepishly explains). When not startling passengers or experiencing 
flashback-induced panic attacks, he focuses his attentions on Alice 
Sutton (Julia Roberts), a lawyer with the Justice Department. He watches 
her through her apartment window, and periodically bursts into her office 
to share his latest paranoid notions. Sutton permits the intrusions 
because Fletcher once protected her when she was attacked by muggers. 
Things change suddenly when Fletcher is scooped up by mysterious agents, 
led by Dr. Jonas (Patrick Stewart), whose questions indicate that one of 
Fletcher's conspiracy stories has struck a nerve with someone very 
powerful. Sutton gets drawn into the fracas and the questions begin. Just 
how mentally ill is Fletcher? Is he an ally or a threat to Sutton? Who is 
Dr. Jonas and what does he want from Fletcher. Who are the good guys and 
who are the bad guys? Just what the hell is all this really about? 
Richard Donner keeps you guessing as he confidently spins his tale. Far 
too many key moments in "Conspiracy Theory" depend on coincidences, and 
the film is occassionally too slick for its own good, but that's par for 
the course from the guy who directed "Lethal Weapon". What Donner excels 
at is utilizing actors and locations for maximum effect, and he's in fine 
form here. 
The film's three leads are exceptional actors. Mel Gibson does an 
outstanding job portraying the mentally ill cabby. His mannerisms and 
phrasing are credible, creating a character who is sometimes touching, 
sometimes beguiling, and often quite disturbing. In addition to his 
paranoia, Fletcher is obsessive/compulsive. When confronted about his 
irresistible urges to seek out copies of "The Catcher In The Rye", he 
breaks down in a swirl of confusion, frustration, and shame. The scene is 
completely believable and quite moving. Gibson is a connoisseur of bad 
puns and the Three Stooges, and tosses in several puns and one pointed 
Stooge reference. The self-indulgence is mildly annoying, but stays 
within acceptable limits, because its conceivable that the character 
might share the same traits. 
Julia Roberts does fine work as Alice Sutton, adding welcome personal 
details to what could easily have been a stock character. At one point, 
Sutton uses a fire extinguisher to crack apart a padlock. After breaking 
the lock, she pauses to hand one of the pieces to a cohort. Nice touch. 
Roberts shades Sutton with a wistful nature that compliments her powerful 
personality. 
Patrick Stewart's Dr. Jonas shares the commanding presence that made his 
Star Trek performances resonate, combined with an extra air of elegance 
and menace. Again, Stewart takes a potential stereotype and adds just the 
right amount of nuance to keep the audience wondering about the true 
nature of the man.
Donner does wonders with his New York locale, playing the city as if it 
were another character. It rains during most of the night scenes - - all 
the better to reflect the neon lights and enhance the romance of New York 
after dark. It's a obvious trick, but it works. His daylight scenes 
depict New York as a huge, intricate and somewhat threatening machine. 
Most of the daytime scenes are shot under overcast skies. In fact, it 
seems the sun only shines to make Julia Roberts' beautiful hair glisten 
all the more.
"Conspiracy Theory's" storyline is admittedly ragged. The plot gets a bit 
too confusing at times, while becoming overly conventional at other 
moments. But despite the weak points, the film is consistently 
entertaining, thanks to the premise, Donner's assured direction and the 
sharp performances from Gibson, Roberts and Stewart, along with well-
drawn work from the supporting players. "Conspiracy Theory" will never be 
mistaken for art, but it's a fine diversion during these dog days of 
summer.

Title
Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
Good Will Hunting (1997)
Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard,
 Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser. Directed by Gus Van Sant. 125 minutes.
R, 4 stars (out of 5 stars)
Coming-of-age stories are almost always about men and there's a good 
reason for that. Despite all the hype about how far men have evolved from 
the old days, the truth is that most of us haven't. We've read about how 
contemporary men express their emotions instead of bottling everything up,
 but we don't quite know how to do that. So we still try to be tough, yet 
accessible; stoic and cool. We strive to live up to some vague male ideal 
that probably never existed, and we feel like frauds. Coming-of-age films 
are invaluable because they give us a chance to vicariously grow up all 
over again. 
Which brings us to "Good Will Hunting," a rich, rewarding coming-of-age 
tale starring Will Damon and Robin Williams. The screenplay, written by 
Damon and his co-star and boyhood friend Ben Affleck ("Chasing Amy," 
"Going All The Way",) is reminiscent of other male-bonding films, notably 
"Ordinary People" and "Dead Poets Society," but quite emotionally 
satisfying in its own right. Their portrait of a lost young man whose 
unresolved pain triggers explosive outbursts, and the two father figures 
who battle over his soul, hits all the right notes. Under the assured 
hand of director Gus Van Sant ("My Own Private Idaho," "Drugstore 
Cowboys") even the maudlin parts of the story retain an emotional clarity.
 Like "Hoosiers," "Good Will Hunting" takes a well-worn theme and makes 
it seem fresh, thanks to exceptional acting and solid, three-dimensional 
storytelling.  
Will Hunting (Damon) is a scrappy young tough from South Boston's Irish 
ghetto who works as a janitor at a prestigious university. A mathematical 
genius with a photographic memory, Hunting has no direction, spending his 
time pounding beer and exchanging mock insults with his buddies, 
particularly his best friend Chuckie (Affleck.) When MIT Professor 
Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard from "Breaking The Waves") spots the boy 
casually solving an advanced math problem, he pursues Hunting, only to 
find him jailed for assaulting a police officer. Lambeau arranges to take 
the troubled kid under his wing, with two conditions. Hunting must do 
math work with the professor and agree to participate in therapy for his 
antisocial behaviors. Following several disastrous attempts to match the 
boy with a therapist, Lambeau finally turns to Sean McGuire (Williams,) a 
psychology professor at a small community college. McGuire, who grew up 
in the same neighborhood as Hunting, tries to help the boy confront his 
inner demons, only to find his own painful memories stirred up as well. 
Further complicating matters is Hunting's awkward courtship of Skylar 
(Minnie Driver,) a wealthy Harvard senior preparing for medical school.
For men seeking to vicariously relive their adolescence, Will Hunting is 
the perfect flawed hero. Rakishly handsome and as fast with his tongue as 
he is with his fists, Hunting has limitless potential, if he can only 
break through his own emotional barriers. To make the wish-fulfillment 
scenario complete, he is surrounded by a support system most people only 
dream of; a group of loving, encouraging pals, a smart, charming 
girlfriend, and two, count 'em, two father figures trying to help the kid 
better himself. In lesser hands, this material could have been unbearably 
mawkish, but thankfully, Damon and Affleck's script balances the angst 
with loads of earthy humor to keep the proceedings grounded. That, 
coupled with Van Sant's confident direction and some powerhouse acting, 
helps "Good Will Hunting" to pay off in grand fashion. 
Matt Damon, who made quite an impression in "The Rainmaker," gives a 
breakthrough performance here. Possessed with tousled good looks and a 
killer smile, the charismatic actor is utterly convincing as a super-
intellect, while maintaining the character's working-class sensibilities. 
He's really quite remarkable here. Robin Williams does admirable work as 
well, showing what a fine actor he can be when he restrains himself. As 
the wounded professor, Williams projects great strength and defiance, 
tempered by a gentle, caring nature. The chemistry that slowly builds 
between him and Damon is electrifying.
As Skylar, Minnie Driver has an earthy charm that comes from her 
willingness to completely let down her guard. Whether telling a dirty 
joke to the guys at a bar, or breaking into tears in the darkness, she 
possesses a bracing sense of honesty. It's easy to understand why Hunting 
is drawn to her.
Also good are Skarsgard as the driven math professor and Affleck as 
Hunting's closest friend. In fact, there isn't a bad performance to be 
found in the film. The strong acting, along with Van Sant's ability to 
make the South Boston setting feel authentic, allows "Good Will Hunting" 
to triumph over its occasional moments of excess sentimentality. Cynics 
may dismiss the film as an overly effusive festival of male-bonding, but 
for the rest of us, this is just the catharsis we need.

"Go" really earns its "R" rating and I like that. The film 
unapologetically presents amoral characters, recreational drug use, 
marginally-sympathetic dope dealers and young people having sex with 
strangers, along with nudity, violence, gunplay and a car chase that 
actually packs some oomph, all set against a low-rent backdrop of L.A. 
raves and tacky Las Vegas glitz. This "Pulp Fiction Lite" wallows in 
recklessness and, in these oh-so-responsible times, there's something 
perversely refreshing about that.
For his second feature, "Swingers" director Doug Liman, working from 
newcomer John August's screenplay, weaves together three stories that 
spring from a single encounter at a grocery store. After following one 
plotline for roughly 30 minutes, he returns to the initial setting to 
launch into the second tale, then repeats the technique for the third, 
which flows into a conclusion that more or less wraps up all three 
stories. The fragmented, non-linear technique is ambitious and not 
altogether successful, but offers more than enough satisfying moments to 
make up for its weak points. 
A big part of the fun in "Go" comes from the film's many surprises, so 
I'll keep the plot description as bare-bones as possible. It begins at a 
Los Angeles grocery, where checkout clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) spends the 
Christmas holiday season working overtime, trying to earn enough money to 
avoid eviction from her apartment. Reluctantly, she agrees to work a 
shift for Simon (Desmond Askew), so he can vacation in Las Vegas with 
friends. Then soap opera actors Zack and Adam (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) 
show up at the store to buy drugs from Simon. 
Plotline A begins when the entrepreneurial Ronna decides to make some 
extra cash by handling the drug deal herself. With two pals in tow, she 
visits Simon's dealer, Todd (Timothy Olyphant), leaving her friend Claire 
(Katie Holmes) as collateral while she conducts the business. Things go 
very wrong, leading her to pursue a risky backup plan at a nearby rave. 
Plotline B follows Simon and his buddies to Las Vegas, where some 
remarkably bad decisions result in a wild, and quite entertaining, chase 
scene. Plotline C chronicles the travails of Zack and Adam when they 
become involved with an extremely intense police officer (William 
Fichtner) and his equally bizarre wife (Jane Krakowski).
Ronna's storyline works primarily because of a hilarious depiction of 
life from the perspective of a kid whacked out on Ecstasy, and the 
considerable talents of Sarah Polley and Timothy Olyphant, two actors 
with wonderfully expressive eyes. Polley, so good in "The Sweet Hereafter,
" is compelling here, managing to look defeated and determined 
simultaneously, and Olyphant proves adroit at blending a menacing stance 
with an off-kilter sexiness. Interestingly, "Dawson Creek's" Katie Holmes,
 the closest thing this film has to a traditionally nice character, is 
also the blandest. 
The center story, focusing on the misadventures of Simon and his buddies 
in Las Vegas, provides the juiciest action and biggest laughs. Breckin 
Meyer is a hoot as Tiny, a Caucasian kid trying his damnedest to be black 
("If you were any whiter, you'd be clear," snaps one of his friends), but 
the lion's share of the time is given to Simon and Marcus (Taye Diggs), 
whose trip to the Crazy Horse strip club turns into a riotous flight from 
a vengeful father and son. Director Liman, who dealt with Las Vegas and 
male bonding in "Swingers," seems most comfortable handling this segment, 
effortlessly blending repartee and action scenes. Desmond Askew and Taye 
Diggs make a great comic team, with Simon's skittering impulsiveness and 
Marcus' Tantric efforts at serenity balancing out beautifully. 
The third storyline, featuring Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf, suffers by 
comparison. The couple's situation demands that they be nervous, but I 
still found their stammering and furtive glances tiresome. Thankfully, 
William Fichtner and Jane Krakowski are a scream, exuding a deliciously 
ominous forced peppiness during a tense dinner scene with the boys. The 
husband and wife clearly have an agenda beyond sharing Christmas cheer, 
and the payoff is memorable. 
Of the countless movies patterned after "Pulp Fiction" (it's hard to 
believe that only five years have passed since Quentin Tarantino turned 
contemporary cinema upside down with that film), "Go" is the best one yet,
 due to Liman's assured direction, coupled with a well-constructed script,
 a generally strong cast, great editing and effective use of music. Is 
the film a triumph of style over substance? Of course, but this genre is 
based on the pursuit of style over everything. Had the characters been 
more substantial, their nihilistic behavior would have been hard to take, 
and in "Go," nastiness and irresponsibility is half the fun.

I felt strongly conflicted while watching "Instinct." Part of me 
wanted to just surrender and enjoy the film, relishing the strong 
acting and philosophical message. But every time I gave in, something 
would happen to remind me that, beneath the surface, this was just 
another mainstream Hollywood movie. "Instinct" is extremely 
derivative, needlessly manipulative and even a bit superficial, but 
I'm still giving the film a qualified recommendation because, as 
annoying as the bad parts are, the good parts are really, really good.
Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Theo Caulder, an upwardly mobile psychiatrist 
given the juicy assignment of assessing Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony 
Hopkins), a renown anthropologist and primatologist who left for 
Africa to study gorillas and returned a madman. Seems that the doctor,
 whose relations with his family were distant at best, developed a 
much better rapport with the great apes. Powell disappeared into the 
jungle, only to emerge much later in chains, accused of attacking a 
group of men and murdering two of them. 
Housed in the psychiatric wing of a maximum security prison after 
being shipped back to the States, Powell is to be evaluated for 
competency. Young Caulder sees a career boost, and a possible best-
seller, in his new patient, but as he tenuously builds a relationship 
with the damaged man, he discovers something far more significant.
One of the best things about "Instinct" is the casting, along with 
most of the performances. In the wake of his Academy Award-winning 
turn in "Jerry Maguire" and wildly jubilant acceptance speech at the 
Oscar ceremonies, Cuba Gooding Jr. has done the over-enthusiastic rah-
rah bit to death, culminating in a series of soft drink commercials 
where he comes off like a coked-up personal trainer gone berserk. 
Thankfully, Gooding is controlled, thoughtful and quite engaging here 
(although in one scene, where he leads a group of prisoners in a 
defiant chant, I half expected him to start thrusting cans of Pepsi 
at the convicts). Gooding makes the transition from silky opportunist 
to shaken human being very effectively, and he works beautifully with 
Anthony Hopkins.
As usual, Hopkins is superb, taking a role earlier slated for Sean 
Connery and putting his own definitive stamp on the character. 
Manacled and slightly hunched over, he silently peers out from his 
long white hair like a leopard behind wild reeds. Hopkins doesn't 
just play the deranged anthropologist, he inhabits him. From the 
film's moving (and incredibly realistic) scenes of Powell communing 
with a family of gorillas, to a stunning extended sequence where he 
gives Caulder a harrowing lesson on the illusion of control, Hopkins' 
work is flawless. 
Alas, the script is not. Gooding and Hopkins are so strong that it 
takes awhile to notice that the production is a somewhat sluggish 
pastiche of other movies, from "Gorillas in the Mist" to "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest," with a healthy dose of "Equus" to boot. The 
film even includes the "standing in the rain with arms outstretched 
as a metaphor for freedom" overhead crane shot from "The Shawshank 
Redemption," "Pleasantville" and God knows how many other flicks. 
While the image was once evocative, it now needs to be put out to 
pasture once and for all.
Hopefully there's also room in that pasture for lovable loonies, 
another irritating movie cliché. Mental illness isn't adorable, as 
everyone (except screenwriters) already knows, but "Instinct" offers 
a pair of convicts who, despite being criminally insane, are more 
insufferably cute than all four "Teletubbies" combined. 
While "Instinct" embraces too many trite plot devices, it 
successfully navigates past a few. Even though "NewsRadio's" Maura 
Tierney, playing Powell's estranged daughter, achieves a nice 
chemistry with Gooding, their relationship remains platonic, sparing 
us a needless romantic subplot. 
Unfortunately, the filmmakers don't resist the temptation to wrap up 
their story with a stupid Hollywood ending. I won't disclose the 
details, but as you leave the theater, consider the logistics of the 
final image and ask yourself how it could have occurred. The answer 
is simple: it couldn't. While you're at it, reflect on how the 
resolution seems to negate the one thing for which Powell gives 
Caulder thanks. Better yet, do yourself a favor and don't stay for 
the ending. I'm serious. Late in the film, when Gooding finishes his 
speech about "the game," get up and walk out. Then, on the way home, 
make up your own ending. I guarantee that whatever you come up with 
will be more plausible that what the writers concocted. 
Despite the clichés, despite the languid pacing, despite seeing great 
character actors cast as stereotypes, and even despite the ending, 
I'm still glad I saw "Instinct." The film delivers a message that, 
however obvious, bears repeating. And it provides a fine showcase for 
the considerable talents of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Anthony Hopkins. To 
watch actors as electric as those two, it's worth sitting through the 
rough stuff.

The DVD format is perfect for a film like "Mission: Impossible 2."
Through the wonders of DVD, you can savor the thrilling opening scenes,
hop, skip and jump through the sluggish center section, then enjoy the
walloping non-stop action of the last 40 minutes or so of the feature.
Just for the hell of it, you could even use the fast forward button to
boost the various slow motion shots back to normal speed (which would
likely make the film a good 10 minutes shorter). Of course, "M: I-2"
won't be available on DVD for six to eight months, so, in the meantime,
viewers will just have to suffer through the dull stuff in exchange for
the juicy moments. It's a fair trade.
"Mission: Impossible 2" marks the much anticipated meeting of legendary
action Director John Woo ("Face/Off", "Broken Arrow"), Tom Cruise and
the "M:I" franchise. Woo hurls every one of his trademarks into the
fray: martial arts, gorgeous slo-mo, birds taking flight, billowing
clothing, swirling camerawork and operatic violence, all set to a
thunderous score. In fact, Woo even winks at the audience this time
around: During one particularly tense scene, he positions sitting birds
around darkened hallways, making us wonder when they will take
Woo-flight and reveal our furtive hero's presence to the bad guys.
Where the first "Mission: Impossible" suffered from an overcomplicated
plot, matters are more straightforward this time around. Impossible
Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) finds his vacation interrupted
by a crisis of potentially global proportion. Renegade agent Sean
Ambrose (Dougray Scott) is out to steal a horrific Ebola-like virus
called Chimera, developed by an evil pharmaceutical company so they can
cash in on the antidote. To aide in his quest, Hunt recruits super thief
Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's former honey-bunny. Needless to
say, Hunt and Hall become an item almost immediately. With veteran
computer expert Luther Stikell (Ving Rhames, the only actor besides
Cruise to return from the first film) providing backup, the chase is on.
The film opens in high style, with a confrontation above the clouds that
guarantees that "M: I-2" will never be shown as an airline movie. Cut to
Ethan Hunt on holiday, climbing a beautiful, harrowing red rock face
thousands of feet above the earth (Cruise insisted on doing his own
stunt work for the scene and the result is unusually exhilarating).
After Hunt receives his mission instructions (delivered by Anthony
Hopkins in an uncredited cameo), Woo jumps to the titles, then to stars,
then to Spain for the next sequence, which introduces Thandie Newton.
It's a great beginning, followed, unfortunately, by a long draggy
stretch. Aside from a playful car chase, not much happens for far too
many minutes.
Beyond the laborious plot mechanics, there are relationship problems.
While Cruise and Newton make a fine couple, Ethan Hunt and Nyah Hall
bond too quickly to create a sense of emotional weight. The instant
intimacy between the pair hurts the later proceedings; each of them is
willing to make enormous sacrifices for the other, but it doesn't quite
feel credible. To a lesser degree, Hunt and Ambrose suffer from the same
trouble. We see a fury between them that goes beyond the simple good
guy-bad guy dynamic, but the source of the intense personal animosity is
not explained. A little more information would have helped enormously.
Instead, we get seething looks and a dull mid-section, with the
wonderful Ving Rhames relegated to the background to keep the lead hero,
the lead heroine and the lead villain squarely in the spotlight. Despite
the rubber masks and messages that will self-destruct in five seconds,
this film is more 007 than Impossible Missions Force, with Tom Cruise as
the Bond du jour. While Cruise is more than up to the task, I missed the
teamwork that made the TV series (does anyone even remember the TV
series at this point?) so much fun.
For the last 40 minutes of "M: I-2," John Woo pulls out all the stops
and delivers the kind of action that should have been spaced throughout
the entire film. The man remains a master of style, as evidenced by the
flames reflected in Ambrose's eyes, a single bird flying through a fiery
door and a phenomenal motorcycle duel. Woo needs to be careful  if he
continues repeating stock flourishes, he risks self-parody  but for
this film, they still pay off. "Mission: Impossible 2" lacks emotional
punch and the center section sorely tried my patience, but the film
remains a hell of a ride.

Review for Ronin (1998)
Ronin (1998)
Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean 
Bean, Skipp Sudduth, Michael Lonsdale, Jan Triska, Jonathan Pryce, Feodor 
Atkine, Katarina Witt, Bernard Bloch. Music by Elia Cmiral. Screenplay by 
David Mamet (under the pseudonym Richard Weisz) and J.D. Zeik. 
Cinematography by Robert Fraisse. Produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. Directed 
by John Frankenheimer. 121 minutes.
Rated R, 3 stars (out of five stars)
Following a morning press screening of "Ronin," the theater manager met 
me and a fellow critic in the lobby and asked what we thought of the 
action thriller. When we each said that we enjoyed the film, he took a 
step backwards in shock, as if we'd popped him in the head with a ball-
peen hammer, then exclaimed in utter amazement, "I can't believe it! How 
could you...why would you...I mean, it was total crap!" 
I laughed and said, "It was like sitting at home on a lazy Saturday 
afternoon, watching one of those old-fashioned action movies where you 
don't care about the plot because it's so much fun simply watching car 
chases and big stars shooting at each other." "That's exactly what's 
wrong with it," he said. "There was no substance, just clichés and car 
chases."
"But that was all on purpose," I countered, "The director deliberately 
threw in virtually every movie cliché in the book. John Frankenheimer is 
no dummy. He was winking at us! Besides, Robert De Niro and Jean Reno are 
two of the greats and watching them work together was good enough for me.
" The theater manager shook his head and said, "Aw, you like those two so 
much that you're letting them blind your judgment. And as for all that 
'winking at us' business, well, that's just not enough anymore."
We changed the subject at this point, realizing that with this particular 
film we would find no common ground. I've included the exchange here 
because, although I disagree with my associate, his point of view is 
valid and deserves recognition. That "Ronin" is a virtual cavalcade of 
film clichés is inarguable. My contention is that Frankenheimer's use of 
those clichés is part of his artistry.
Set in France, "Ronin" deals with a group of mercenaries hired by an 
operative (Natascha McElhone) to retrieve a heavily-guarded briefcase 
before another shadowy group snags it. The mercenaries are highly-skilled 
ex-government agents, ready to work without asking questions, as long as 
the price is right. Who are the two groups and what is inside the 
briefcase? It doesn't matter and that's the beauty of "Ronin." 
Working from a script by David Mamet (using a pseudonym due to a Writer's 
Guild conflict), John Frankenheimer strips the action thriller genre down 
to its bare bones. These films aren't about plot, they're about plot 
mechanics. They're not about well-drawn characters, they're about 
archetypes exchanging quips. They're not about logic, they're about sound 
and motion set against exotic locales. 
So what does he give us? World-weary soldiers and an earthy young beauty 
racing through gorgeous French cities. Elaborate plans in musty rooms and 
intricate double-crosses. Daring gun battles and high speed car chases 
down narrow streets and twisting mountain roads. And, most important, 
conversations between Robert De Niro and Jean Reno.
De Niro and Reno compliment each other in grand fashion, first as wary 
coworkers and later as comrades who bond under duress. As American ace 
strategist Sam, De Niro is efficiency personified; a seasoned agent who 
knows the importance of maintaining his cool no matter how dire the 
situation. He also chooses to keep his background to himself. Asked if he 
has every killed anyone, he allows the tiniest hint of a smile as he 
answers "I hurt somebody's feelings once." Jean Reno plays Vincent, a 
French procurer and facilitator who radiates calm as he goes about his 
business. Regardless of his actions, you sense that this is an inherently 
decent man. 
In keeping with the motif of minimalism, the rest of the cast are rough 
sketches, with each exhibiting only one identifying characteristic. 
That's fine, since De Niro and Reno provide all the character required 
for a film like this. Their exchanges are punctuated by hair-raising car 
chases and elaborate set pieces. High points include a night time battle 
near the Seine, a sly reconnaissance mission at the Majestic Hotel in 
Cannes, and a climatic stand-off during an ice show. Frankenheimer douses 
each set piece with classic movie clichés: billboards telegraph upcoming 
scenes and there's a fruit cart on every street, just waiting to be 
overturned during the next chase sequence. 
What does it all add up to? For me, it was a refreshing visit to the good 
old days of charismatic actors engaged in intricate, exciting and 
pointless bedlam. For my theater manager friend, it was a maddening 
example of all that's wrong with contemporary cinema. If you're so 
inclined, check out "Ronin" and decide which one of us was right.

I saw "Evolution" last night at a sneak preview sponsored by a radio
station. The response from the capacity crowd was overwhelmingly
positive. They howled at the jokes and sections of the audience broke
into applause several times. As the closing credits rolled, I heard more
than one person exclaim "That was the best comedy I've seen in a long
time!"
The general reaction left me mystified, because "Evolution" is pretty
mediocre fare. Clearly patterned after "Ghostbusters," which was also
directed by hit-and-miss filmmaker Ivan Reitman, the sci-fi comedy pits
wisecracking academics against bizarre creatures and petty government
officials, but the similarities between the films end there.
"Ghostbusters" was a true original, while "Evolution" is, at best, a
moderately entertaining variation on a theme.
Set in Glen Canyon, Arizona, "Evolution" opens with would-be fire
fighter Wayne Green (Seann "what's the deal with that extra 'n'?"
William Scott) practicing rescue techniques in the desert when a meteor
screams down from the sky, wrecking his car before it crash-lands in a
cavern. Two local college professors come to study the rock:
geologist/volleyball coach Harry Block (Orlando Jones) and biologist Ira
Kane (David Duchovny).
They discover that the meteor is teeming with one-celled alien organisms
with the ability to reproduce and adapt at amazing speed. When Ira leads
a field trip to the site, he learns that the evolution is happening even
faster than he and Harry believed; the ground is covered with
extraterrestrial flatworms.
Soon, the government takes over the crash site, with a snide general
(Ted Levine) banning the locals. Working alongside the general is Dr.
Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) from the Centers for Disease Control. Ira
and the comely doc initially butt heads, but quicker than you can say
"formula flick" she hooks up with the good guys.
Just in time, too, as the little alien critters are multiplying and
mutating like crazy. One mosquito-like creature invades Harry's body,
throwing the geologist into panic mode as an examining physician states
"It's headed toward his testicles!" Note: In the trailers for the film,
the destination is changed to "crotch," while "bottom" is used in the TV
ads. Hmmm. Regardless, the whole thing builds to an anal rescue scene
that had the audience in hysterics.
Initially, the aliens die as soon as they are exposed to our atmosphere,
but they quickly adapt and grow even more aggressive. A sad-eyed
creature absurdly misidentified as a dog (wow  just like in
"Ghostbusters." What a coincidence!) demonstrates its jaw power in front
of a group of housewives. A winged lizard swoops through a mall with a
shoplifter in its talons. Ira, Harry, Allison and Wayne team up to stop
the invasion, leading to the obligatory battle royale. In this case, the
insipid finale involves yet another anal procedure, coupled with one of
the most blatant product placements in movie history.
While "Evolution" is mildly entertaining, its lazy screenplay (which
began as a drama) insures that the movie will never rise above tepid.
There are a number of good one-liners (Duchovny gets off a nice joke
based on his former "X-Files" persona), but for the most part, the
filmmakers simply lean on the special effects, which are not all that
special. Sorry, boys, but a parade of monsters isn't enough anymore.
The cast is saddled with characters as unimaginative as the script.
Seann William Scott, Stifler from "American Pie," says "Wow!" a lot,
Orlando Jones, best known as the star of a dreadful series of 7-Up ads,
makes black jokes, Julianne Moore stumbles over everything and David
Duchovny does his usual deadpan shtick. Oh, and he moons the general.
Speaking of the general, you might remember Ted Levine from "The Silence
of the Lambs," where he played Buffalo Bill, the serial-killing lunatic.
I kept hoping Levine would turn up in front of the aliens nude, with his
genitals tucked behind his legs, saying "It doesn't come to Earth
without an invitation."
But that would have been nervy, and "Evolution" isn't about taking
chances. About two-thirds of the way through the story, some of the
aliens evolve into quasi-human form. What if they had evolved further?
They could have developed language skills and negotiated with the
government for citizenship. Or they could have done to us what we did to
the Native Americans, dumping our heroes into low-income housing on a
Human Reservation. At the very least, they should have developed their
writing skills and turned out a better screenplay than this one.

Director Penny Marshall told Premiere magazine that "Riding in Cars with
Boys" should do for teen pregnancy what "Jaws" did for swimming. While
the film most certainly does show the devastating effects an unplanned
pregnancy can have on young lives, the production is anything but a
downer. For every sad or painful moment (and there are many) "Riding in
Cars" provides an amusing counterpoint. While, at 131 minutes, the film
sags in spots, it is remarkably rich and robust, with a wealth of
memorable performances.
Based on Beverly D'Onofrio's 1990 autobiography of the same name, the
ambitious screenplay by Morgan Upton Ward ("A Pyromaniac's Love Story")
hops around between 1961 and 1986 as it chronicles the life of a young
woman whose dreams of becoming a writer are sidetracked when she becomes
pregnant by a well-meaning, but hapless neighborhood boy. Teen-age
Beverly (Drew Barrymore) repeatedly tries to better herself, but can't
escape the low rent life with her baby and drug-addicted husband, Ray
(Steve Zahn).
During a road trip that serves as a framing device for the film, Beverly
must finally deal with the results of her impulsive and self-absorbed
youth as she travels cross-country with her adult son Jason (Adam
Garcia) to meet with the long gone husband and father.
In lesser hands, the whole affair could have become unbearably mawkish
or grim, but Penny Marshall has a real gift for mixing humor with
heartbreak. From Bev's attempts to throw herself down a stairway to
Ray's "lyrical" wedding proposal ("Please marry me because I'm shit
without you."), there are a lot of laughs to be had.
The casting is flawless. Although she struggles a bit while playing the
upper end of her character's age range, Drew Barrymore does a wonderful
job as Bev, successfully rounding out the unsympathetic aspects of the
woman. Steve Zahn, who shows more depth with each new film, is just as
good as Ray. Lorraine Bracco and James Woods are solid as Bev's parents
and Brittany Murphy is letter perfect as best friend Fay (Just wait
until you hear her impersonation of Loraine Bracco). A number of little
actors play the children at various ages and they are all delightful.
Unfortunately, two very talented performers are given little to do.
"Roseanne" veteran Sara Gilbert should be starring in films, not
appearing in thankless supporting roles. And Rosie Perez is relegated to
a few harrowing moments onscreen, looking impossibly severe. How severe
does she look? Let me put it this way: Had she looked like this in
"Fearless," Bubble would have leapt from her arms before the plane
crashed.
Bursting at the seams with period music, sets and outfits, "Riding in
Cars with Boys" takes a bleak story and invests it with magic, all
without compromising any hard truths. What a pleasant surprise.

''Return to Me'' is the kind of film I normally shred with the
enthusiasm of a puppy that just snagged your favorite slipper. The
romantic comedy is unabashedly sentimental, with plot contrivances
galore, stereotypical supporting players, overdone accents, nuns on
bicycles and an adorable gorilla. As if all that wasn't enough, it even
features Jim Belushi, whose very presence is enough to cause most
productions to implode. But from beginning to end, I found the film
utterly charming. Hell, I even liked Belushi.
Oh, what an awkward position for a jaded critic to be in.
First time director Bonnie Hunt (who also co-wrote the script and plays
a key role) casts David Duchovny and Minnie Driver in her fairy tale.
Duchovny plays Bob, a Chicago architect who loses his zoologist wife
Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) in a car wreck. Minnie Driver is Grace, a
barmaid on the waiting list for a healthy heart who receives a second
lease on life thanks to Elizabeth.
Months later, Bob wanders into the funky little restaurant run by
Grace's Irish grandfather (Carroll O'Connor) and Italian great-uncle
(Robert Loggia). The old boys play matchmaker, leading to the inevitable
pairing of Bob and Grace. Of course, the road to romance is rocky. Bob
still grieves the loss of Elizabeth and Grace is so painfully
self-conscious of her surgical scar that she's afraid to get intimate
with anyone. Cautiously, they begin the courtship ritual.
This may read like typical cutesy-poo fare, but that's only because it
is. And there's more. When O'Connor (who uses an Irish accent straight
out of a ''Lucky Charms'' commercial), Loggia and company aren't
hovering over the couple like mother hens, they spend their time
exchanging good-natured insults and debating the merits of vintage
singers. Going into sugar shock, yet? Well, try this on for size. The
ape Elizabeth worked with had a special gesture he used only with her.
When Grace visits the zoo, he cozies up to her right away. How cosmic.
The film has a fair share of chunky shtick as well. Bob's best pal
(David Alan Grier) fixes him up for an evening out, leading to some
extreme overacting from Bob's boorish date. There's also a running gag
over Jim Belushi's efforts to stop swearing in front of his kids. And we
have the aforementioned encounter with a perky bicycle-riding nun.
I could go on, but you get the idea. There's enough sweetness here for a
dozen Meg Ryan movies, but the damned thing still got to me.
Part of the reason is Minnie Driver and David Duchovny. Driver projects
a disarming vulnerability and, at long last, Duchovny drops his
''X-Files'' ironic cool and plays a guy who smiles and laughs and cries
like an actual human being. Together, they made me care about the
well-being of their characters.
Another reason is Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi. As Grace's closest
friends, they make a dandy couple. Hunt's tongue is as sharp as ever,
but nicely tempered by her nurturing qualities. As for Belushi, after
screwing up a long series of leading man roles, he is very likable in a
supporting turn, playing an affable lug quite comfortable in his skin. A
scene where he does an impromptu belly dance for Grace and his wife is
funny and appealing. Few other actors could successfully pull that off.
But the biggest reason is Bonnie Hunt's direction. She establishes and
maintains a fairy tale sensibility that makes the convoluted plotting
easy to tolerate. Hunt obviously conveyed her storybook approach to the
supporting cast, convincing them to go for magic over credibility.
The magic worked for me. I enjoyed spending a couple of hours in a world
where loving relatives dote over your every move, where caring friends
are there when you need them, and where romance triumphs over all.
There you have it. ''Return to Me'' is a cavalcade of corn, but I had a
ball. So sue me. Incidentally, I plan to keep this review handy from now
on. Whenever anyone fires off an irate letter accusing me of being a
cold-hearted bastard because I ragged on the latest mawkish offering
from Robin Williams, I'll send them a copy of this and let them choke on
it.

Review for Titanica (1992)
Titanica (1992)
Imax Corporation documentary directed and produced by Stephen Low. 40 
minutes (a 94 minute version is also in circulation). 
NR, 3.5 (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/

This 40 minute Titanic is a beautiful, eerie piece of work, plunging 12,
500 feet beneath the unforgiving waters of the North Atlantic to examine 
the remains of the doomed ship. After seeing James Cameron's epic, gazing 
at the real thing becomes even more chilling. 
The camera glides silently through the watery depths, capturing ghostly 
images: dinnerware strewn over the ocean floor, the remains of the 
steering mechanism of the captain's wheel, J.P. Morgan's cabin. For me, 
the line between fiction and reality blurred for just a moment, as I 
caught myself scanning the sandy sea bottom looking for Rose's necklace.
Intercut with the remarkable deep sea footage are vintage photographs of 
the ship and an interview with Eva Hart, who was 7 years old when her 
father placed her in the lifeboat and said "Be a good girl, hold mummy's 
hand." She never saw him again. 
Eva's commentary is memorable. "I was calm until I saw the ship sinking 
and heard the people screaming," she explains in quiet tones, "I remember 
everything." Sitting in her English garden, the elderly woman reflects on 
the ship billed as unsinkable, saying "Mother thought to call it 
unsinkable was flying in the face of the Almighty."
Hart was worried when she heard about the 1985 discovery of the wreckage, 
fearing the site would be looted. Two years later it was. "They robbed a 
grave," she says, "The IMAX Titanic expedition weren't going down to 
plunder it. I think it's splendid."
The documentary is splendid as well. Commentary from a salty Russian 
expedition member adds welcome humor while maintaining the dignity such 
an excursion demands. Even in the huge theater, you feel a bit 
claustrophobic watching the two small submersibles fighting the 
incredible deep sea pressure as they head for the ocean floor. The 
photography is stunning, amazingly well-lighted and so clear that in some 
scenes it's difficult to remember that there is water between the camera 
and the remnants of the ship. 
The film ends with an appropriate and touching gesture, as the crew 
leaves a bundle of flowers on the ocean floor, "for the children of 
Titanic." Like "Titanic," "Titanica" is a thoughtful remembrance of the 
lives lost when mankind's reach exceeded its grasp.

Review for Going All the Way (1997)
Go to www.nuvo-online.com for an cover story on "Going All The Way", plus 
additional film reviews.
Turning "Going All The Way" into a movie wasn't easy. So much of Dan 
Wakefield's classic novel takes place in the thoughts of one sad, 
repressed and desperately horny young man. How do you take such an 
interior story and transfer its essence to the big screen? Quite well, 
thankfully. 
With some PBS documentaries and the award winning video of Pearl Jam's 
"Jeremy" giving them a little clout, producer Tom Gorai and director Mark 
Pellington convinced Wakefield to write the screenplay for his story, 
then secured funds to film it in Indianapolis, where the novel is set. 
Pellington is an ardent fan of "Going All The Way", having read the book 
at least 25 times, and knows the lead characters inside and out. His 
vision and Wakefield's dialogue merge to create a remarkably faithful 
adaptation of the story of two young soldiers returning to Indianapolis 
in 1954. While train-bound home, Sonny Burns, an introvert who has spent 
most of his brief life trying to blend into the nearest wall, is 
mortified when another soldier, Gunner Casselman, strikes up a 
conversation. Sonny remembers Gunner as one of the "big rods" from high 
school, a handsome, assured athlete and cocksman, a member of a social 
caste Sonny envied and feared. Gunner's experiences overseas have changed 
him, however. He now views his glory days in high school as the stuff of 
childhood and longs to find the deeper meanings of life. He admires Sonny 
for "not buying into all that jock bullshit" and Sonny, feeling like a 
total fraud but grateful for the friendship, bonds with him. Much to the 
confusion and dismay of their respective parents, the two set off on a 
quest for substance, only to find their penises acting like divining rods,
 drawing them towards the nearest beautiful woman.
In his 1970 novel, which sold over a million copies, Wakefield made what 
could have been a stock coming-of-age story fresh with his stunningly 
honest look at the details of spiritual, social  and sexual desperation, 
balanced with many sardonically funny moments. Pellington conveys those 
feelings with striking visual style, using bold colors and contemporary 
editing techniques to allow us to see the world through Sonny's eyes. 
When the young man gets drunk at a dance, Pellington's edgy camera 
captures Sonny's perceived urbane finesse, including an absurd, brilliant 
dance scene you will never forget. When a sexual liaison turns into a 
disaster, Pellington employs a black and white palette and stark lighting 
to show Sonny's nightmarish race away from the scene of his humiliation. 
Again and again, Pellington comes up with just the right method to thrust 
us into the center of Sonny's tortured soul. Pellington came up with just 
the right actor as well. Jeremy Davies, who made his mark in the indie 
film "Spanking The Money", is a scrawny young man who doesn't faintly 
resemble the doughy character described in the novel, but within moments 
Davies makes it clear that he IS Sonny Burns. Stammering, shifting and 
casting his eyes ever downward, Davies is remarkably adept portraying a 
man who appears apologetic for merely existing. Complimenting Davies is 
Ben Affleck ("Chasing Amy") as Gunner, in an confident, effective 
performance. The original cut of "Going All The Way" was nearly three and 
one half hours. Forced to trim the film to under two hours, Pellington 
had to edit a major subplot involving, among other things, the 
ramifications of Gunner growing a beard in the ultra-conservative 
Indianapolis of the 50s. Sadly, the result somewhat mutes the development 
of Gunner's character and gives the talented Affleck limited time to show 
his chops. Hopefully we'll see a director's cut with restored footage 
someday.
Several supporting cast members stand out, notably Amy Locane as Buddy, 
Sonny's "safe" girlfriend, and Rachel Weisz, dazzling as Marty Pilcher, 
an art student who hits Gunner like a thunderclap. Jill Clayburgh is 
scary as Sonny's mother, an over-possessive fundamentalist whose cloying 
patter fails to mask her emotional terrorism, and Lesley Ann Warren is a 
knockout as Nina, Gunner's sexy Mom. Warren has one of the film's most 
outrageously comic scenes, when she confronts Gunner over his 
relationship with a Jewish girl and spews some absolutely insane anti-
Semitic bile.
Production designer Therese Deprez won an award at the Sundance Film 
Festival for turning Indianapolis into a model of 1950s style. Her sets 
are dead-on, providing a bright contrast to the story's dark tone. 
Enlivened by many funny moments, "Going All The Way" remains a dark tale 
that invigorates because of its bracing honesty. Wakefield, Pellington 
and company have much to be proud of here. Hopefully, their work will 
show other filmmakers that classic books can become winning films, when 
talented artists respect the integrity of the source.

Congratulations on the new film, Wes. After a long career as a horror
director, I can certainly understand why you wanted to break into the
mainstream. With "Music of the Heart," you've certainly done so. In
fact, this inspirational story, starring Meryl Streep as a
middle-class woman who brings the joy of music to inner-city kids, is
about as mainstream as you can get. I do have a few questions about
the production, though, and hope you'll bear with me.
I realize how frustrating it was to be locked into the horror
genre. You were never given the respect you deserve, despite being one
of the greats. You wrote and directed the original "A Nightmare on Elm
Street," only to see the studio take your creation and crank out a
series of increasingly shoddy sequels. You did a hell of a job
directing "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (that scene with the wicked
government man approaching a strapped-down Bill Pullman with a hammer
and a long nail Yikes!), but the film didn't appear to open any
new doors for you. Even with the incredible success of the "Scream"
franchise, you were still perceived by some as just another guy who
makes scary movies. The money and respectability of mainstream films
must have been incredibly tempting, but I wonder what drew you to this
particular project.
I know that you were moved by the true-life saga of Roberta Guaspari,
a mother of two from New York's suburbs who started teaching violin to
kids in Harlem after her husband left her. Her story is moving and
dramatic, especially when, after a decade of service, funding cuts
threaten to end her music program, but
Wes, what I'm getting at is this. Why make a big, glossy Hollywood
movie of this story? The 1996 documentary, "Small Wonders," already
captured the magic of Roberta and her devoted students. The violin
playing was wonderful and the Carnegie Hall concert footage
stunning. With an Academy Award nominated feature already available to
the public, why recreate it with actors? I realize that many people
would rather have a root canal than watch a documentary, but did you
really think a fictionalized account would pack as much punch as the
real thing?
Frankly, if your intent was to share insights about Roberta Guaspari,
it didn't work very well. Yes, we understand how shaken she was when
her husband ditched her; that was obvious. Roberta comes off
determined and obsessive, but what really makes her tick? Her young
sons seem fiercely devoted to mom, but when the film abruptly jumps
ahead ten years, her oldest boy is surly and resentful, complaining
about virtually every aspect of her parenting skills. Then, almost as
suddenly, he does a complete behavioral turnaround and is all smiles
again. What was up with that?
And why the formulaic story treatment? Come on, man, a lot of this
movie plays like something from the Lifetime Channel. You incorporate
virtually every cliché in the book, including a reaction shot from
a dog, for God's sake! Many characters seem to exist solely as props
for Roberta, like the Afro-Centric mother whose fiery rhetoric is
snuffed out by one Arthur Ashe reference from Roberta. Too easy,
Wes. And was it really necessary to throw in that nasty music
department character? Not only was the actor over the top, but his
presence seemed totally unnecessary.
Now, I know Madonna was originally cast in the role of Roberta, but
left because of "creative differences." Exactly what were those
creative differences? Did you finally see her in "Shanghai Surprise?"
Speaking of casting, why hire Gloria Estefan and the wonderful Angela
Bassett and then barely use them? Such a waste of talent.
Of course, some of the casting worked out well. Meryl Steep turns in a
fine performance, although her mannerisms are awfully reminiscent of
her character in "The Bridges of Madison County." As Roberta's
potential love interest, Aidan Quinn is more lifelike than usual. I
loved seeing Cloris Leachman back on the screen, even though her
character is another cliché, and young Michael Angarano is terrific
playing Nick as a boy.
Forgive me if it seems like I'm damning the movie with faint praise,
but I expected more sparks and less convention from a man as talented
as you. There were exhilarating moments, like the shots of various
children learning self-esteem from the discipline of playing the
violin, and the concert sequence is electric, even though it also
seemed a little too slick. More interaction between the violin masters
and the students might have helped. Incidentally, was one of the
characters sporting Freddy Krueger's hat? If so, nice touch!
Hopefully, on your next mainstream film, you'll feel comfortable
enough to take more chances. In the meantime, I'll rent "Small
Wonders" and watch the real thing instead of this movie-of-the-week
version. One final request, Wes. Would you track down the Miramax
executive who changed the title of the film from "Fifty Violins" to
the sappy "Music of the Heart" and kick his ass for me? Thanks, buddy.

The most annoying of several cloying holiday films, ''Patch Adams'' takes 
the true story of a '70s medical student who defied school authorities 
with his humorous, personal approach to patient care, and twists it into 
yet another platform for Robin Williams to ham it up. The human Care Bear 
chucks all the restraint he displayed in ''Good Will Hunting'' and 
returns to his tired shtick, careening between manic cornball gags and 
mawkish sentimentality. The whole thing plays like a really long Robin 
Williams' talk show appearance with a plot slapped on.
Williams plays Hunter ''Patch'' Adams, a real-life doctor who currently 
operates a highly unorthodox clinic in West Virginia. His interest in 
medicine began in 1969, when he became suicidal and committed himself to 
a mental hospital, only to discover that his contacts with fellow 
patients were more therapeutic than sessions with his doctors. Adams 
decided to become a physician himself and entered medical school, where 
he annoyed the hell out of the medical establishment by blurring the 
doctor/patient line with his heartfelt, Catskills comic approach to the 
sick and suffering.
Adams' real-life story, documented in the 1993 book ''Gesundheit: Good 
Health is a Laughing Matter,'' is fascinating, but the film version is 
simply painful, turning mainstream doctors into cardboard villains and 
allowing Williams 110 minutes of insufferable self-indulgence. Robin 
Williams deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ''Good Will Hunting.
'' His performance was tight, controlled and compelling; everything that 
is absent here. Williams is the sort of performer who requires a director 
to reign him in, protecting the actor from his own worst tendencies. In 
''Patch Adams,'' he simply runs amok. 
The film pits Adams against paper tigers, presenting traditional doctors 
as anal-retentive, self-righteous prigs. I found the blanket portrayal 
offensive, an insult to the many dedicated, overworked men and women who 
tirelessly devote themselves to quality patient care, often at the 
expense of their own well-being. If you believe this film, Patch was a 
red-nosed missionary, a medical superhero single-handedly fighting 
arrogant, uncaring pill-dispensers in the name of truth, justice and the 
Borscht-belt way. I didn't buy it for a second.
Adams' chief nemesis is Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton), a character with 
absolutely no depth or humanity, given to statements like ''we will 
rigorously and ruthlessly train the humanity out of you and turn you into 
something better.'' He fumes nonstop at Adams, raging over the Patch's 
attempts to ''bring us down to their level.'' Continuing the stereotyping,
 the film presents all nurses as uniformly sympathetic, twinkling angels 
beaten into submission by the evil doctors and all too happy to assist 
Patch in his whoopee-cushion quest. What a load of crap. 
The film engages in non-stop emotional manipulation, stretching 
situations to ridiculous lengths to make Patch Adams a comic martyr. 
Watch Patch restore an elderly woman's will to live by plopping her into 
a vat of noodles! See Adams break the shell of a hateful cancer patient, 
bonding with him so completely that the man shoos his wife and children 
away from his deathbed, so he can spend his last moments on Earth with 
Patch! Gaze in amazement as the filmmakers wrap up the movie with a 
hearing in front of a medical board, allowing Williams one more 
opportunity to deliver a maudlin speech.
Or better yet, don't. Avoid this parade of clichéd schmaltz and read the 
book instead. It has to contain more truth than this syrupy disaster. At 
one point, a fellow student turns to Patch Adams and says ''God, you're 
being so self-indulgent!'' If only the director could have had the 
courage to say the same thing to Robin Williams.

A little behind-the-scenes glimpse at the fabulous world of film 
reviewing. Prior to the press screening for "The X Files," the promotion 
representative asked my paper to agree not to print a review prior to the 
film's official release date. I asked why, if Time and Newsweek were 
running advance reviews, anyone would give a rat's ass if an Indianapolis 
newspaper offered an opinion two days early. "It's studio policy," the 
rep informed me in curt tones. "Besides, they don't want to see any early 
reviews popping up on one of those sneak preview web sites." 
"Oh please," I moaned, "I'm a professional journalist. Do you honestly 
think I'm going to take material I'm paid to write and submit it to 
'Ain't It Cool News' under a pseudonym? Writing is not easy and I have no 
interest in seeing my finished work in giant type on a fan page, 
attributed to 'Pudding Whistle' or something." The rep was unimpressed by 
my little tirade and grudgingly, I agreed to their terms. 
The reason I've shared this with you is because there's only so much one 
can say about the actual film without spoiling the fun. A big part of 
enjoying "The X Files" series comes from trying to figure out the secrets 
of the show's labyrinthine conspiratorial story arc and the same holds 
true for the film, so you'll see no spoilers here. 
For those who have never followed the show and may feel intimidated by 
reports of the series' elaborate back-story, you can rest easy. The film, 
while complex, stands alone and is understandable to newcomers. Hard core 
fans who worried that the movie would reveal too much can relax as well. 
While "The X Files" clarifies the series mythology, there are definitely 
plenty of secrets left. 
After an effectively spooky prologue set in 35,000 BC, the film picks up 
where the show's season finale left off, with the X Files closed and Fox 
Mulder and Dana Scully working on an FBI terrorism unit in Dallas. An 
explosion draws the pair back into the thick of the conspiracy, which 
leads them everywhere from the desert to Antarctica. Along the way, we 
meet new shadowy characters, witness a significant moment in the droll 
duo's relationship, and get some dandy scares. Leaving the theater, I 
felt just satisfied enough and found myself looking forward to the fall, 
when we'll see where the series leads from this invigorating turn.
"The X Files" plays like an expanded episode of the TV show and that's a 
good thing. Instead of getting carried away with making an theatrical 
epic, Chris Carter and company wisely remembered the importance of 
maintaining the tone of the series. David Duchovny's laconic Mulder and 
Gillian Anderson's intense Scully are fascinating characters who play as 
well on the big screen as on the tube. 
Continuing the series tradition, the film tosses in humor at unexpected 
moments. Fans will delight in a scene addressing Mulder's chronic deadpan 
expression, while event movie producers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich 
will wince over a hilarious, very pointed dig at one of their films.
A couple of minor gripes. Mitch Pileggi, one of the series' strongest 
characters, is underused here. And the film's climax, while both scary 
and exciting, is a bit ragged, with a few plot holes and gaps in internal 
logic. 
The better episodes of the "X Files" series play like abbreviated movies 
and, quibbles aside, "The X Files" lives up to the high standards set by 
the show. Is it the best "episode?" No. But it's a good one. "The X 
Files" moves at a fast clip, sets and maintains a creepy tone and answers 
just enough questions. There's still a lot of truth left to be revealed, 
but this entertaining "X Files" does a nice job of whetting our appetites 
for what's to come.

How raunchy is "Scary Movie?" Director Keenan Ivory Wayans held a private
screening of the comedy and, when the camera got up close and personal with
a high school girls' gym teacher, his own parents walked out of the theater.
They won't be the only ones. The spoof of teen slasher flicks pushes the
R-rating envelope further than any other film to date, including "South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut." Make no mistake, "Scary Movie" is
unbelievably gross and juvenile. It's also the funniest thing I've seen
since the Farrelly brothers' "There's Something About Mary."
A love-it-or-hate-it film, "Scary Movie" will likely provoke a slew of "how
low can we go?" articles from self-appointed social guardians. Already,
several early reviewers have had conniption fits over the film's graphic
sexual imagery. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. For all of our
freewheeling posturing, the United States remains painfully squeamish about
carnal matters. It's part of the lingering fallout from peer pressure
exacted by the Puritans on neighboring communities over 200 years ago, which
resulted in our collective "sex is great as long as you feel terrible about
it afterwards" mentality. Many years ago, at a Caribbean cultural festival,
a gorgeous Haitian fire dancer summed up our national mindset beautifully
when she said to me, "America is such a constipated country."
For 88 sidesplitting minutes, Keenan Ivory Wayans takes the sexual images
that make us squirmy and rubs them in our faces, one-upping the Farrellys
along the way. Did the "buns and wieners" scene in "There's Something About
Mary" make you wince? Keenan gives us an erect penis used as a lethal
weapon. And where "Mary" featured the legendary "hair-gel" scene, "Scary
Movie" offers a geyser of semen.
Utilizing the scattershot comedy approach that filmmakers have tried to
replicate (usually without success) since "Airplane," the story is a
take-off of "Scream," meshed with "I Know What You Did Last Summer."
Somebody dressed up in a ghost-face costume is murdering teenagers and
stalking four kids who accidentally killed a man on a dark highway a year
earlier. The most memorable scenes from both movies get spoofed here, along
with loads of other films, including "The Exorcist" and "The Usual
Suspects."  Wayans and company even manage successful send-ups of "The
Matrix" and "The Blair Witch Project," two films that have been parodied to
death.
"Scream" honey bunnies Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette receive
special attention. In a lively performance, "Saturday Night Live's" Cheri
Oteri tweaks Gale Weathers, Courteney Cox Arquette's take-no-prisoners
newscaster character, as Gail Hailstorm (hey, I never said the writing was
sophisticated), author of the hit exploitation book, "You're Dead, I'm
Rich." Dave Sheridan tackles David Arquette's Deputy Dewey, along with the
actor's real-life goofball persona, as Doofy, a drooling idiot with a paper
star pinned to his chest. Doofy, incidentally, is the creepiest element in
the production, playing too much like a mean-spirited mockery of a retarded
person.
Most of the cast does solid work, primarily because the filmmakers
remembered the most important lesson from "Airplane": Actors in spoofs
aren't funny unless they play it straight. Kurt Fuller adopts a riotous
deadpan as the local sheriff (at a press conference, he solemnly intones
"The killing of these teenagers is tragic, but, you know, shit happens") and
Anna Faris, in the Neve Campbell spot, creates the film's most well rounded
character.
The slapdash production, while extremely funny overall, contains some
missteps. Lochlyn Munro, whose turn as a lunatic student in "Dead Man on
Campus" was the one great note in an otherwise leaden movie, disappears
early in the story. A running joke about a barely closeted gay football star
(Shawn Wayans) is beaten into the ground. And, on several occasions, the
filmmakers merely recreate scenes from slasher films without bothering to
enhance them.
Still, the laughs come fast and furious, with Wayans tackling everything
from "Riverdance" to race relations (when the killer comes after Anna, she
e-mails the authorities with the message "White woman in trouble!" and a
slew of police cars show up in seconds). As with "Airplane," "Scary Movie"
lobs dozens of jokes at the wall and, while some fall to the floor, most of
them stick. That's pretty good for a film SO FOUL, SO DISGUSTING AND SO
DEPRAVED THAT IT WILL LIKELY MEAN THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT!!!!

With his first two films, "In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends &
Neighbors," writer/director Neil LaBute explored corporate and sexual
politics with a searing eye that thrilled many viewers, while sending
others racing for the exits. This time around, Fort Wayne, Indiana's
most noted provocateur ventures a little closer to the mainstream,
albeit a mainstream with some choppy waters and the occasional acidic
eddy.
"Nurse Betty" is a skewed fairy tale, a loopy road movie that shifts in
tone from whimsical to soothing to shocking and back again. With a
(mostly) crackerjack cast and a plot that zags every time you expect it
to zig, the production is a welcome relief after weeks and weeks of
lousy flicks.
The story, which earned John C. Richards and James Flamberg a Best
Screenplay award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, chronicles a
pivotal period in the life of Betty (Renee Zellweger), a coffee shop
waitress and ardent soap opera fan in Fair Oaks, Kansas. Although her
smarmy car-salesman husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), has forgotten her
birthday, Betty plans to celebrate in style, borrowing a car from her
hubby's lot for a night on the town with a girlfriend.
But matters go terribly wrong. After watching a tape of her favorite
serial, "A Reason to Love," and swooning when the show's most popular
character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) intones "I know there's
someone special out there for me," Betty glances into her living room
and witnesses a horrific sight. Husband Del is frantically negotiating
with hit men Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), when an
ugly exchange leads his being scalped and then shot to death (sensitive
viewers should be ready to avert their eyes several times during the
film). The shock throws Betty into a fugue state, marked by a
combination of amnesia and physical fright. The suddenly psychotic
woman, who always dreamed of being a nurse, hops into the 1997 Buick
LaSabre and heads towards Los Angeles for a romantic "reunion" with her
beloved Dr. Ravell.
Among the many things Betty doesn't know is that the car's trunk holds
the very cache of drugs that prompted Del's visit from the hit men.
Charlie and Wesley set out after Betty, determined to recover the
narcotics and wipe out the witness to their work.
"Nurse Betty" is one of those rare films able to reference numerous
other movies ("The Wizard of Oz," "Thelma and Louise" "The Purple Rose
of Cairo," "Being There" and "Pulp Fiction," to name but a few), while
still feeling like a true original. LaBute, whose previous movies were
marked by inventive, but minimalist camera movements, proves adroit at
fluid filmmaking. As always, he brings out the best from his performers.
Renee Zellweger, so terrific in "Jerry Maguire," does her best work to
date here, making a remarkably smooth transition from sweet, mousy
housewife to whacked-out adventurer. But her best moments come when the
fugue state cracks, plunging the woman into an alien reality. Despite
her massive, understandable confusion, she displays a grand air of
strength and personal resolve while sorting things out.
Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as senior hit man Charlie. Freeman,
one of the best actors working today, creates a complex persona that
somehow manages to remain sympathetic despite his deadly occupation.
Greg Kinnear is solid and likable in the dual roles of a soap opera
character and a "real life" actor, while the wonderful Allison Janney
gracefully steals scenes as the producer of "A Reason to Love."
On the down side, Aaron Eckhart is wasted in a brief, cartoonish turn as
Betty's piggish husband. Eckhart, who starred in both of LaBute's other
films and won a wide audience as Julia Roberts' boyfriend in "Erin
Brokovich," deserves more than a glorified cameo appearance. And then
there's Chris Rock. Yes, I know he has legions of fans. Yes, his
abrasive behavior fits that of junior assassin Wesley. But Rock's loud,
whiny style is pure, fingernails-on-the-blackboard annoying to me. I
look forward to the day when he becomes seasoned enough to deliver his
high quality jokes in a less screechy fashion.
Still, "Nurse Betty" is a corker. The highlight of the film is
unquestionably Betty's cocktail party exchange with key members of "A
Reason to Love," where her psychosis is mistaken as a Method Acting
audition, but what happens soon after is even more admirable. I won't
spoil it for you. Suffice to say that the screenwriters recognized the
perfect moment for Betty's fugue state to end, allowing her journey to
move from fantasy to substance. Following a summer where most film
characters were depicted spinning in circles, it's gratifying to watch
someone grow as a person. It's gratifying to watch the enormously gifted
Neil Labute's filmmaking growth as well.

"The Tailor of Panama" is a different kind of spy movie. Despite the
presence of Pierce Brosnan, there is nary a hint of James Bond flash
here. Instead of big action scenes, leering super villains and
empty-headed femme fatales, we get interesting characters and an
intriguing situation. Based on the novel by John le Carré, who also
co-wrote the screenplay, the film offers viewers something rarely seen
in theaters this time of year: a solid, well-told story.
Brosnan plays Andy Osnard, a British operative walking on thin ice. His
British superiors ship him off to Panama, making sure he understands
that he had better not screw up the placement. Osnard arrives in the
tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new
home base. When shown the Bridge of the Americas by a person marveling
over the fact that, since the creation of the Panama Canal, the
structure is the sole connection between North and South America, he
barely keeps from yawning. Brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the
antithesis of 007, investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian
quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no
end.
Searching for a way to get information on the government, Osnard sets
his sights on Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), an unctuous tailor serving
the Panamanian elite. Harry claims to be a transplant from Britain's
renowned Saville Row, but Osnard knows his secret: The tailor is an
ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop
in an insurance scam. He also knows that Harry is up to his ears in
debt, having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm.
Osnard offers Harry a way out. He will pay for information Harry has
gathered from his upscale clientele. Eager to comply, Harry offers what
he knows, then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing.
Before long, he is forced to spy on his loving wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee
Curtis), an aide to the Canal director.
Harry's little lies build, eventually taking on a life of their own.
Osnard turns in reports about the "silent opposition," a group
threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal. The bogus
revelation proves explosive, leading to meetings in Washington D.C. over
how to best protect the vital waterway. Meanwhile, Osnard wallows in his
newfound status, enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an
attractive co-worker. And Harry grows ever more fretful, fearing the
consequences if his clients, not to mention his wife, learn about his
lies.
Geoffrey Rush is wonderful as Harry, fawning over his customers by day
and savoring his rich family life in the evenings, all while playing
secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor. Rush makes Harry
a credible figure, presenting the various levels of the character so
effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity. After
gaining fame playing larger than life characters, Rush flips everything
around for this role, using his energy to depict the quiet desperation
of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse
than the original problems.
Although she gets far too little screen time, Jamie Lee Curtis imbues
Louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her. Of the
central characters, she is the only one that exhibits maturity and
genuine self-confidence. Curtis is one of my favorite female actors;
whiplash smart, sultry and charismatic, she deserves more than
supporting roles.
Speaking of supporting characters, there are some great ones here.
Harold Pinter is amusing as Harry's Uncle Benny, who pops up throughout
the story in a number of creative ways. Also shoring up the proceedings
is Jon Polito as a corrupt banker and Dylan Baker, who is a riot as a
United States general straight out of the Dr. Strangelove school of
armed patriotism.
But the most important secondary performers are Leonor Varela and
Brendan Gleeson, both outstanding as two wounded activists. Their
presence adds weight to the story, reminding us that beyond the charades
of the leading men, there are real people that have suffered greatly
over the politics connected to the Canal. Director John Boorman adds
additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location. Instead of
using Panama City merely as a colorful backdrop, he adroitly weaves in
footage of all aspects of life there. The metropolis, described by one
character as "Casablanca without heroes" pulsates with life, underling
the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have
a disastrous impact on a great many people. "The Tailor of Panama"
succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it
more than a simple entertainment.

Just before a battle scene early in "Gladiator," General Maximus
(Russell Crowe) turns to his second in command and says "At my signal,
unleash hell." The moment is significant for two reasons. First, because
Crowe delivers the sentence perfectly  as an instruction, not a movie
tagline (imagine how the command would have sounded in an old Clint
Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger flick). Second, because when Maximus
finally gives the signal, his troops really do unleash hell, a horrific,
mesmerizing explosion of fire, blood and fury.
Directed by Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner," "Alien," "Thelma and Louise"),
"Gladiator" is the first film since the '60s to visit the swords, sweat,
decadence and deliverance of the Roman Empire. In the heyday of the
genre, the films could be divided into two camps: low budget, cheesy,
overstuffed action epics with wooden acting and strong homoerotic
subtexts, and expensive, cheesy, pretentious Judeo-Christian action
epics with hammy acting and slightly more subtle homoerotic subtexts.
Scott's film successfully navigates around these traits (not that
there's anything wrong with a juicy homoerotic subtext). He presents his
tale in a direct, no-nonsense fashion, with uniformly excellent acting
and, thankfully, no laborious speeches.
For a Roman epic, the story is easy to follow. (SPOILER ALERT: PLOT
POINTS FOLLOW) General Maximus is a humble Spaniard who has never even
seen Rome. His only goal is to finish his service to the emperor so he
can return home to his wife and son. But after the aforementioned
battle, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) asks Maximus to be his
successor. The aging leader can't turn over the empire to his children.
While his daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) would "make a fine Caesar,"
women are forbidden to rule, and Aurelius fears that his reckless son
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) would abuse the power of the throne.
His concern is well placed. When Commodus learns of his father's plans,
he murders the Emperor and orders the deaths of Maximus and his
family.     Maximus escapes his would-be assassins, but arrives home too
late to save his wife and son. The grieving General is captured and made
a slave, landing in a North African outpost where ex-gladiator Proximo
(Oliver Reed) runs a training camp. Eventually, Maximus ends up in the
Colosseum of Rome, fighting for his life while the sneering Commodus
gazes down from the good seats. Maximus, anonymous behind his warrior
helmet, has a new task  to somehow avenge the murders of his loved ones
and insure that the wishes of his commander are finally carried out (END
SPOILER ALERT).
It's a familiar plotline ("Rob Roy" and "Braveheart" covered the same
turf), but Ridley Scott has a knack for taking a simple story and
turning it into something special. "Gladiator" dazzles because of
stellar acting, thrilling action scenes and spectacular imagery.
Russell Crowe heads the fine cast with yet another flawless performance.
Fresh from dual triumphs in "L.A. Confidential" and "The Insider," he is
positively searing as Maximus, using his amazing physicality to turn an
icon into a man. Crowe is the grounding force of the movie  we believe
because he makes us believe.
In his best work to date, Joaquin Phoenix is riveting as the wicked
Commodus. Playing an effete character with balls is no easy task, but
Phoenix pulls it off grandly. Although they receive limited screen time,
Connie Nielsen makes quite an impression as the regal Lucilla and Djimon
Hounson is memorable as the warrior Juba.
"Gladiator" also gives us the chance to see two seasoned veterans strut
their stuff. With wispy white hair and a deeply creased face, Richard
Harris simultaneously projects corporeal frailty and strength of spirit
as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. In his final role, Oliver Reed steals scenes
with gusto as the jaded entrepreneur Proximo. Incidentally, the press
kit for the film states "Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away in Malta on May
2, 1999, near the end of filming his role in 'Gladiator.'" Is it just
me, or does the use of the word "near" seem ill chosen?
The art direction in "Gladiator" is as impressive as the cast. Deftly
combining elaborate sets with computer graphics, Scott and company
present ancient Rome, from the streets of the city to the magnificent
Colosseum, with incredible verisimilitude. An aerial shot gliding up and
over the massive Colosseum is particularly breathtaking. For me, though,
the most memorable image was that of Maximus' hand gently sweeping over
stalks of grain, which speaks well of the artistry of Ridley Scott.
Still, I have a few quibbles with the film. The numerous battle scenes
are extremely robust, consistently exciting and inventively staged, but
Scott's frequent use of jump cuts makes the action hard to follow. And
while the swordplay is quite impressive, it can't hold a candle to the
phenomenal mano a mano sword fight at the end of "Rob Roy," where you
can actually feel the imposing weight of the weapons.
Finally, there's a question of thematic depth. Maximus battles not to
end the tyranny of slavery or to stop the barbaric games where men are
killed as entertainment for the masses, but to avenge his family and be
true to his fallen sovereign. His cause is personal  a bit too personal
for a story of such grand scale. As a result, I found myself admiring
"Gladiator" instead of being engulfed by it. Still, my admiration is
quite strong for this gorgeous, savage, terrifically acted film. Ridley
Scott may not have created the perfect epic, but he came awfully close.

Screenplay by Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis & Peter Tolan, based on the

"Bedazzled" should have been a corker of a movie. A loose remake of the
well-regarded 1967 comedy written by and starring Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore, the story of a love struck loser who sells his soul in exchange
for seven wishes is serviceable enough. Leading man Brendan Fraser has a
good track record with comedy and Elizabeth Hurley certainly has the
physical assets necessary to make a sultry Devil. As if all that wasn't
enough, the director of the production is Harold Ramis, the man behind
"Caddyshack," "Groundhog Day" and "Analyze This."
"Bedazzled" should have been a corker, but the results are only
moderately amusing. Fraser is overly cartoonish, as are most of the
supporting players, and the love story is too superficial to be
involving. Overall, the film plays like an expensive episode of a TV
sketch comedy series.
The problems begin with a sloppy script by Larry Gelbart ("M*A*S*H"),
Ramis and Peter Tolan. Their story revolves around Elliot Richards
(Fraser), a computer tech-support worker with godawful social skills.
Mocked and shunned by his co-workers, Elliot pines for Alison (Frances
O'Connor), a beautiful fellow employee he has worshipped from afar.
After blowing an encounter with her at a nightspot, he says aloud that
he would "give anything" to have the woman.
Enter Lucifer, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley. In exchange for his
soul, she offers him seven wishes. Elliot leaps at the chance, only to
discover that Beelzebub has no intentions of giving him a smooth ride.
Elliot wishes he was rich, powerful and married to Alison. In a flash,
he gets his wish, only to learn that he is a rich, powerful Colombian
drug lord with enemies everywhere. Alison is indeed his wife, but she
detests him.
And so goes the game, as Elliot keeps trying to make the perfect wish,
while Satan continues to find some flaw in his wording that will allow
her to make his life a nightmare.
This type of story has been done a million times, but even the most worn
idea can work if the writers are sufficiently inventive. In "Groundhog
Day," Ramis took a similar set-up, which gave the hero multiple chances
to win the heart of a woman, and crafted a comedy that was as sweet and
touching as it was funny. He did so by allowing his protagonist to grow
from a one-note wiseass into a rounded human being and by allowing the
romance to grow from superficial attraction to something far more
substantial.
Don't look for any growth here. Elliot remains a buffoon throughout the
film, until the closing moments, when Ramis and company whack him upside
the head with an unconvincing epiphany. In the romance department, don't
expect anything deeper than "I want her. Let's cast another spell."
There was a moral to "Groundhog Day," one that was appreciated because
we saw it lived out on the screen. The moral in "Bedazzled" is so
slapped on that the filmmakers actually feel the need to have a
character state it aloud.
As for the comedy, where "Groundhog Day" moved from physical shtick to
subtler humor, "Bedazzled" sticks with slapstick and sight gags. The
story trudges from one sketch to another, a la "Saturday Night Live,"
with varying degrees of success. Expect everything from dick jokes to a
short, but sweet Abe Lincoln routine. The worst is a dated Dennis Rodman
bit, while the best is a cute piece of business, nicked from the
original film, involving Satan and a row of parking meters.
The lead actors add to the film's troubles. As Elliot the nerd, Brendan
Fraser overplays his part. In the "Superman" movies, Christopher Reeve
made a great Man of Steel, but a lousy Clark Kent, burying his character
in a load of facial twitches and excessive stammering. Fraser does the
same thing, turning Elliot from an insecure guy to a grating dork
caricature. As with Reeve, Fraser fails to realize that, when it comes
to self-conscious males, less is more.
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Hurley is content to coo her way through the film,
changing costumes frequently, to the delight of the guys in the row
behind me. While most of her outfits are red designer devil wear, her
sexiest moment comes during a classroom scene, where she sports the
adult version of the classic Catholic schoolgirl outfit. Hurley's acting
is competent at best, though she does get to coolly informs Elliot,
"Yes, there's a God and, yes, he's a man. Most men think they're God 
this one just happens to be right."
Despite the occasionally solid one-liners, Hurley's performance lacks
bite, which is the main failing of "Bedazzled." If talented filmmakers
take on themes as familiar as this, it should be because they have
designed a bracing new approach to the material. When they put their own
movie on cruise control, you wonder why they bothered with the project
at all. Or more to the point, why should we?

In "The Gift," Cate Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a widowed mother in a
mossy southern town who inherited moderate clairvoyant abilities from
her grandmother. Annie supplements her monthly Social Security checks by
doing psychic readings for the locals, but instead of Tarot cards, she
uses a deck of cards with basic symbols on them. Now, to the best of my
understanding, these decks of cards depicting circles, squares, parallel
wavy lines, etc. are simply tools employed by researchers to test for
ESP, which begs the question: what the hell is Annie reading?
Granted, my knowledge in this area is limited, but I believe each Tarot
card has a specific meaning and that psychics divine messages from the
card faces and the order in which they are dealt. So what insight can be
drawn from basic geometric symbols? Surely this practice must be a
violation of the Supernatural Rules of Order. After all, if you can do
readings from ESP test cards, why not flash cards? Or recipe cards? Or
baseball cards ("Ah, it's a Sammy Sosa! You will have a life of
accomplishment, humility and lucrative endorsement deals.")
If my misgivings are sound, then Annie is either making a big mistake or
she's not very bright. The latter may be the case, as Annie does some
astonishingly stupid things later in the film.
The film, by the way, is the latest from Sam Raimi, who previously
offered the taut thriller, "A Simple Plan." Once again, Raimi proves
adept at assembling a strong cast and establishing an evocative
atmosphere. Unfortunately, the similarities between the two movies end
there. "The Gift" is an anemic throwaway that starts strong but fades
fast, due to a main plotline that offers few surprises and a secondary
story that is handled ineptly.
Shot from a dusty script by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, the
production follows Annie as she gets into a heap of trouble by
suggesting that battered wife Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) should
seek help. Shortly after, Valerie's husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves),
explodes into Annie's house and demands that she mind her own business,
while accusing her of worshipping Satan. Clearly, we do not need to ask
Jeff Foxworthy if this man might be a redneck.
In addition to Donnie and Valerie, Annie's circle of friends also
includes a mentally disturbed auto mechanic named Buddy Cole (fans of
"The Kids in the Hall" may insert their wisecracks here) with serious
parental issues, not to mention problems respecting other people's
personal space. Giovanni Ribisi does fine work with the role, managing
to make the character simultaneously creepy and endearing. The
resolution of Buddy's grim storyline is one of the most disappointing
parts of the film. Early on, his circumstances are given almost as much
screen time as Valerie's, but he quickly fades into the background. His
core situation is wrapped up early and abruptly in a scene so poorly
filmed that a key revelation becomes just one more element in a sea of
mayhem.
Raimi and company seem far more interested in getting and keeping Annie
in as much danger as possible. During a rare social outing, she
encounters oh-so-polite school principal Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear)
and his hot-to-trot fiancé, Jessica King (Katie Holmes, vamping it up
terribly and exposing her breasts for the first time onscreen). Annie
postpones buying wedding gifts when she spots Jessica screwing smarmy
lawyer David Duncan (Gary Cole) in the coatroom.
(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD) Jessica disappears that night and frustrated
cops eventually (and reluctantly) turn to Annie, who gets a vision of a
female body submerged in a pond. Said pond belongs to (surprise!)
Donnie, who ends up convicted of her murder. Case closed? Of course not.
Subsequent visions convince Annie that Donnie is not the killer, so what
does she do? She races to share her revelation with a member of the tiny
pool of suspects. If only the woman had spent less time on psychic
readings and more time boning up on "Movie Clichés 101." I won't reveal
any more. Suffice to say that the story builds to a cheesy "Twilight
Zone" style climax (END SPOILERS).
The positives in "The Gift" come mostly from the actors. Blanchett,
Swank and Kinnear are all solid, with Ribisi even better, but the movie
belongs to Keanu Reeves, who delivers a remarkably strong performance.
Trite though they may be, scenes of him terrorizing Annie provide the
only truly scary moments in the film.
Actually, there is one moment even scarier. It's the realization that a
script this lame actually was made into a feature film.

Two key moments in the fizzy and funny comedy "Bowfinger" are 
particularly welcome. In one, Steve Martin's character discovers that 
his new girlfriend is sleeping with someone else. The other comes 
when several cast members realize that Martin's character has 
deceived them on a grand scale. In most movies, both situations would 
lead to dramatic confrontations and bitter words, but in "Bowfinger," 
the transgressions are dismissed with a line or two, because this 
production is concerned with laughs, not melodrama. 
In general, I have little tolerance for Hollywood movies about 
Hollywood movies. More often than not, such films are lazy, with a 
paucity of wit and an overabundance of lame in-jokes and snide, 
cartoonish portrayals of industry archetypes ("Hijacking Hollywood" 
and "Burn Hollywood Burn: An Alan Smithee Film" are two particularly 
dreadful recent examples). Thankfully, "Bowfinger" is more 
imaginative, and considerably funnier, than most films of this genre. 
Steve Martin stars as Bobby Bowfinger, a wannabe movie mogul who runs 
Bowfinger International out of his living room. Although his biggest 
credit to date is "The Yugo Story," Bowfinger has big dreams. He 
wants to produce and direct "Chubby Rain," a sci-fi opus written by 
his accountant about microscopic aliens who invade Earth by riding to 
the surface of our planet in raindrops. Bowfinger has a bankroll to 
back up his vision; since childhood, he has set aside a dollar a week 
and now has a whopping budget of $2,184 to bring his film to life. 
After a studio executive (Robert Downey Jr., in his last role before 
being sent to the Big House by a judge fed up with his chronic drug 
relapses) facetiously says he will green-light the movie if Bowfinger 
can secure the talents of action superstar Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), 
the low-rent filmmaker manages to pitch his concept to Ramsey, only 
to be tossed out of the star's limo. Undeterred, Bowfinger comes up 
with a new angle. Using hidden cameras, he will shoot his actors as 
they approach Ramsey in public places, spout their lines and 
disappear before security can nab them. Then he'll incorporate the 
footage into the rest of his bargain basement movie and, faster than 
you can say "Plan 9 From Outer Space," it's "Chubby Rain" starring 
Kit Ramsey!
Of course, things do not go according to plan. The pampered, 
temperamental Ramsey turns out to be a raving paranoid (among other 
quirks, he is so obsessed with racism that he uses a computer to 
count the "Ks" in a screenplay, then presents the total as "proof" 
that the script is riddled with hidden references to the KKK). Thrown 
into a panic by the repeated appearances of Bowfinger's cast ("these 
strangers keep coming up to me, speaking in some strange white people 
code!"), he goes into hiding at MindHead, a quasi-religious cult 
center whose members wear pyramids on their heads), leaving "Chubby 
Rain" in a lurch. Never one to give up, Bowfinger hires Jiff (also 
Murphy), a good-natured goofball and Kit Ramsey look-a-like, to allow 
filming to continue. Jiff, who aspires to be a delivery boy, quickly 
finds himself in the middle of the madness, as Bowfinger struggles to 
complete his masterpiece no matter what. 
The whole idea is silly as hell, which is a big part of the charm of 
"Bowfinger." The film plays like a feature-length series of "Saturday 
Night Live" sketches, except that the majority of these are actually 
funny. The ensemble cast, reminiscent of legendary bad director Ed 
Wood and his entourage, works well together, with Christine Baranski 
(the best thing about the old sitcom "Cybil") stealing scenes with 
her outrageously arched eyebrows, vampish strutting and over-the-top 
line readings. 
But it's Eddie Murphy who holds the production together with two 
dandy performances. He is absolutely convincing as spoiled superstar 
Kit (referencing personal history, perhaps?) and delightful as the 
innocent Jiff. After restarting his stalled career with "The Nutty 
Professor" and "Dr. Dolittle," it's gratifying to see Murphy shine 
without special effects.
Steve Martin wrote the film and his take on Tinseltown is interesting.
 The sole truly sympathetic character in the entire cast is Jiff, who 
also happens to be the only outsider to the scene. One female cast 
member spends most of the movie sleeping her way up the Hollywood 
food chain, finally ditching Bowfinger and all the other males for a 
romance with a powerful woman. Steve Martin once dated Anne Heche, 
who had a number of relationships with high-profile actors before 
settling down with Ellen DeGeneres. Coincidence?  
Despite its many clever bits (wait until you see how the camera crew 
is recruited) little of "Bowfinger" lingered in my memory after I 
left the theater. Frivolous, wispy and quite disposable, this is 
cinematic cotton candy, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, 
cotton candy is insubstantial, but it tastes good for the few moments 
it's there and so does "Bowfinger."

Review for Love and Death on Long Island (1997)
Love and Death on Long Island (1997)
John Hurt, Jason Priestley, Fiona Loewi, Shelia Hancock, Maury Chaykin. 
Directed by Richard Kwietniowski. 93 minutes.
Rated PG-13, 4 stars (out of 5 stars)

"Love and Death on Long Island" is being described as a comedy, which 
isn't the right term. The film has many funny moments, to be sure, but 
the dramatic themes are far more dominate than the humor. "Love and 
Death" focuses on obsession, compulsion, deception and shame as it 
presents a dark, absolutely riveting character study of a very lost man.
John Hurt, in the performance of a lifetime, plays Giles De'Ath, a stuffy 
British writer who seems to come from another era. The painfully reserved 
widower leads a quiet life, far removed from modern technology and pop 
culture. Early in the film, an interviewer asks him "Does the 20th 
century play any part in your life?" and the answer is clearly No. 
That is, until the day Giles locks himself out of his house and takes 
refuge from the rain at a neighborhood cinema. Instead of seeing an 
adaptation of an E.M. Forster novel, he goes into the wrong theater and 
finds himself watching a "Porky's" style adolescent sex romp called 
"Hotpants College II." Staring in disbelief at the puerile onscreen 
antics, Giles snorts in disgust and prepares to leave in a huff, until he 
catches a glimpse at the vision of actor Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley.
) Watching the defeated Bostock lying on the counter of a soda shop, 
covered in ketchup by the bad guys, Giles is thunderstruck by the beauty 
of the young man and the pose, which to his eyes resembles Henry Wallis' 
romantic Pre-Raphaelite painting "The Death of Chatterton."
Desperately smitten, the author finds himself obsessed with all things 
Bostock. He shoplifts teen magazines featuring Ronnie, too embarrassed to 
purchase the gushy fan rags aimed at young girls. Determined to see the 
actor's other works, he is forced into the modern age, buying a VCR (the 
installer has to explain that Giles will also need a television set to 
use the device) and suffering the smirks of video clerks when he 
sheepishly asks for Ronnie's other two films, "Tex Mex" and "Skidmarks." 
Back at his stately home, Giles locks himself away from his housekeeper, 
clipping photos and articles on the actor and lovingly pasting them into 
a scrapbook, carefully hand-labeled "Bostockiana." 
Giles' obsession becomes all-consuming, leading him to travel across the 
ocean to the actor's hometown on Long Island. Over the course of weeks, 
he methodically tracks down Ronnie's girlfriend Audrey (Fiona Loewi) and 
befriends the bright young model, in hopes of building a relationship 
with the actor on his next home visit.
The film, based on a novel by British film critic Gilbert Adair, does a 
remarkable job of placing us in the mind of Giles De'Ath. Thanks to a 
fine script and Hurt's dead-on performance, it's easy to understand the 
exhilaration Giles feels as he is reborn through his one-sided romance. 
We share the embarrassment and shame as the closeted writer attempts to 
hide his orientation from others. 
The film presents a harrowing portrait of obsession, as Giles' world 
becomes increasingly focused on Ronnie, to the point where it obscures 
all else, including his integrity. Giles doesn't even attempt to justify 
the stalking and all the lies; they are simply tools in his quest. When 
his house of cards eventually comes crashing down and his comprehension 
finally returns, all he can do is gasp "What have I done?"  
Hurt's phenomenally detailed acting is complimented by Jason Priestley's 
earnest performance as Ronnie. Thankfully, Priestley doesn't play Ronnie 
as being dumb. Instead, Bostock comes across as well-intentioned, kind-
hearted and most of all, unfinished. It's possible that Ronnie may well 
become as important an actor as Giles claims he already is, but we can't 
tell for sure because Ronnie is a work in progress. The same is probably 
true of Priestley himself.
Fiona Loewi is impressive as Audrey, giving the character welcome nuance 
and intelligence. It would have been so easy for her to play Audrey as a 
stereotypical vapid model. Instead, she is the most perceptive character 
in the story. One of the film's most striking sequences comes when, in a 
moment of shivering realization, she casts away Giles' web of deceit, 
turns to him and says, in the starkest of tones, "God, you're good." 
All of this is not to discount the film's humor. "Love and Death on Long 
Island" is often a very funny movie, but there is so much more going on 
here that advertising the film simply as a comedy is not only inaccurate, 
it does a disservice to the depth of the story. Enjoy the laughs, but 
don't overlook one of the most compelling, and often disturbing, 
character studies to come along in quite a while.

Usually, movies are best enjoyed if you enter the theater knowing as 
little as possible about what you are going to see. In this age of media 
overload, people receive so much advance information about films; through 
trailers, "insider" shows like "Access Hollywood", magazines such as 
"Entertainment Weekly" and ubiquitous movie reviews, that by the time 
they actually watch the finished product, the experience has been ruined. 
In the case of "The Pillow Book", however, some advance information is 
probably useful. In order to appreciate a film this unusual, you need to 
be in the correct frame of mind. Try to go to the theater with the 
attitude you would have when viewing an art exhibit. Forget traditional 
narratives and just let the film flow over you. "The Pillow Book" isn't 
simply an example of style over substance. In this movie, the style IS 
the substance.
The Pillow Book", the ninth film from director Peter Greenaway ("The Cook,
 The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"), does have a story, but it is told 
more in images and presentation style than in dialogue. Nagiko (Vivian Wu 
from "The Joy Luck Club") is a Japanese-born fashion model obsessed with 
calligraphy and justice. As she grew up, her father (Ken Ogata), a master 
calligrapher and mediocre writer, had a unique birthday ritual. Each year,
 he would celebrate his daughter's birth by painting her face in script, 
while reciting an ancient blessing. Nagiko worshipped her father and 
cherished the annual rite. She also loved the selections her aunt would 
read her from "The Pillow Book Of Sei Shonagon", a 1000 year old volume 
of romantic reminiscence. Nagiko was so enamored with the writings that 
she routinely took meticulous notes on her experiences and feelings to 
create her own pillow book. 
While still a child, Nagiko peeked through a door at just the wrong 
moment and caught a glimpse of her father sexually submitting to his 
publisher (Yoshi Oida), the "fee" for getting his work printed. Young 
Nagiko didn't understand what she saw, but the image would haunt her over 
the years. When she reaches adulthood and her father stops the annual 
birthday ritual, Nagiko flees Japan, and an arranged marriage with the 
publisher's boorish son. In Hong Kong, she becomes a successful model and 
spends her free time seeking sexual and emotional satisfaction, trying to 
get men to paint script on her body. Eventually, she meets Jerome (Ewan 
McGregor from "Trainspotting"), a British translator who suggests she use 
his body as the canvas for her work. The driven woman develops a strong 
erotic and literary relationship with the young man, made all the richer 
by the knowledge that Jerome is the lover of the same publisher who once 
used her father for sexual gratification.
Director Greenaway manipulates images to paint his own pillow book. Most 
of the film is presented in the letterbox format, with occasional 
subtitles (the film's sparing dialogue switches casually from English to 
Japanese) drifting by. The images are layered, with shots on top of other 
shots, and elegant script superimposed on the screen. Music is used with 
strong effect as well, creating a deeply textured multi-media 
presentation that works far more often than it does not. Ironically, some 
of film's most striking images are the simplest: ink-saturated water 
swirling down a drain, Nagiko curled in the fetal position in a round 
basin, and the many body canvases covered in beautiful script. 
There is a great deal of full frontal nudity in "Trainspotting", 
particularly from the remarkably uninhibited Wu and McGregor, but overall 
the effect is not erotic. Greenaway's multiple-imaging echoes and 
amplifies Nagiko's state of mind. She is obsessed with calligraphy and a 
desire for justice. The nude men she paints, except for Jerome, are 
little more than canvases, vehicles for her attempts to satisfy her 
obsessions, and we view them that way as well. Nagiko's obsession and 
self-absorption is the center of "The Pillow Book". She is the only 
character of substance, which is the film's weakest point and probably 
central to what makes it so memorable. 
"The Pillow Book" completely puts the viewer into another person's shoes, 
something that rarely happens in modern film. Nagiko's mind is not a 
pleasant place to be, but it is fascinating. "The Pillow Book" is a 
difficult film, and Greenaway's imaging occasionally seems more like 
grandstanding, but the sometimes disturbing, often beautiful images offer 
an experience one rarely will encounter in a multi-plex.

Review for Seven Years in Tibet (1997)
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film".
The Dalai Lama and his people were driven from their homeland by the 
Chinese more than 50 years ago. Over one million Tibetans were killed and 
6000 monasteries were destroyed.  Decades later, the Dalai Lama continues 
to lead in exile, trying to convince the Chinese government to allow his 
people to return home and live in peace and freedom. The story of these 
noble people deserves to be told, and Hollywood has decided that the best 
way to tell it is, of course, through the eyes of a white male movie star.
"Seven Years In Tibet" is the first of two movies about the Dalai Lama 
due this year. This one is loosely based on the memoirs by Heinrich 
Hammer, whose book proved so popular that it has remained constantly in 
print since its debut in 1953. Brad Pitt plays Hammer, a self-absorbed, 
foul-tempered Austrian who deserts his pregnant wife to go to India and 
climb the Himalayas. Hammer was a Nazi, a fact that is noted, but 
downplayed, in the movie. Conquering the Himalayas was an obsession with 
his people, a point of national pride. While recovering from their first 
failed attempt to scale the mountain, war is officially declared and 
Hammer's group is quickly arrested and tossed into a prison camp. There, 
Hammer receives a "Dear John" letter from his wife, who informs him that 
his son will be taught to view her new husband as his father. Between 
escape attempts, Hammer obsesses about his unseen son, composing letters 
to the child and anticipating a life with him after the war. Eventually, 
Hammer escapes with a group of fellow prisoners, ditches them, and heads 
for Tibet, reluctantly accompanied by Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis), 
a member of his original climbing party. 
Entry into Tibet by foreigners was illegal at the time, but the men bluff 
their way in, and end up entering the forbidden city Lhasa, the home of 
the Dalai Lama. The young leader is a curious child, using a telescope to 
peep at events outside his window. He spies Hammer, summons him to his 
home, and finally, the movie kicks into gear.
The portrait of the Dalai Lama and his people are what "Seven Years In 
Tibet" is really about. While Hammer's story is technically the focal 
point, it is the least interesting part of the film and also the most 
predictable. Think about it. The man is a ruthless, aloof Nazi. When his 
heart finally begins to thaw, he fixates on the son he has lost. Then he 
meets the Dalai Lama, a wide-eyed young boy. Any doubt where Hammer's 
story is headed? 
To Brad Pitt's credit, he does all he can with the role. His accent is 
fine, as is his performance. But after the Dalai Lama enters the film, 
Hammer's personal travails fade into the background. His budding 
friendship with the Dalai Lama, however, provides the film's most 
glistening moments. Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk plays the Dalai Lamai for 
most of the film, and he is an exceptional young actor. His eyes light 
with the joy of a child, but when called to address his people, his voice 
resonates with a sense of wisdom that reinforces Tibetan belief that he 
is their reincarnated spiritual leader. There is a great deal of protocol 
involved in dealing with the Dalai Lama, but when the two are alone, 
decorum is discarded as the boy uses Hammer as his window on the world. 
The most engaging parts of the film involve the Dalai Lama's endless 
questions about everything from movies to the legend of Jack The Ripper. 
The interactions between Pitt and Wangchuk are credible and delightful. 
When Mao takes power, one of his first acts is to "reunite" China. The 
Tibetans react by declaring their autonomy and, very respectfully, 
evicting all Chinese officials from their land. When war looms on the 
horizon, we witness the sad spectacle of a peace-loving people preparing 
to do battle. The tragic finale underscores the importance of the Tibetan 
people's valiant ongoing struggle.
At well over two hours, "Seven Years In Tibet" is too long. It takes an 
hour just to get Hammer to Lhasa, and the film would have been more 
effective if they had cut to the chase quicker. Regardless of its 
structural problems, however, the film is stately, beautiful to look at, 
and tells an important story. It's a shame that Hollywood felt compelled 
to tell it through the eyes of a white male movie star, but at least they 
told it.

Beware of movies with the director's name in the title. Take "John
Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" (please). If the Carpenter brand name wasn't
superglued to the title, this embarrassment would surely have bypassed
theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the USA
Network.
And I would have been spared a headache.
The latest from the director of "Starman," "Halloween" and "Escape from
New York" is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic
horror flick. The production is set on Mars in 2176, where humanity
looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world.
Six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and
work at outposts all over the red planet, terra-forming to make it more
hospitable for future generations.
A matriarchal society. Terra-forming. Sounds pretty intriguing, eh?
Well, don't get your hopes up.

Todd Haynes, acclaimed for his 1995 feature, "Safe," has pulled off quite 
a feat with "Velvet Goldmine." Incredibly, the writer-director manages to 
take the British glam-rock era, one of the most colorful, outrageous, 
fascinating periods in the history of contemporary music, and turn it 
into 120 minutes of unfocused, surrealistic crap. This overwrought 
mishmash of style without substance most closely resembles Ken Russell's 
film version of "Tommy," and it's just as annoying.
Essentially, "Velvet Goldmine" simply rips-off the story of David Bowie 
through his Ziggy Stardust days, with one crucial difference. Bowie was 
interesting and Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is not. Bowie's 
breakthrough came in the '70s, when he pushed the prevailing hippie 
mentality into a more theatrical, androgynous zone. He achieved notoriety 
in England by dressing in a frock and trumpeting his bisexuality. Global 
success came when he adopted the persona of Ziggy Stardust, an orange-
haired alien without eyebrows or defined gender, slinking about the stage 
in feathered boas, inventive make-up and bizarre clothing. With his out-
of-date slang and cheesy sci-fi imagery, Bowie seemed less like a genuine 
rock singer and more like an actor playing one, but damned if he wasn't 
fun to watch. And it was easy to overlook his mannered, occassionally 
wince-inducing lyrical affectations, because the man wrote absolutely 
terrific songs.
During the Ziggy days, Bowie hit the publicity circuit with his look-a-
like wife, Angela, even as rumors circulated about him being spotted in 
the sack with Mick Jagger. When Johnny Carson asked Angela if she was 
concerned about all the girls chasing her husband, she cooed "Oh no, 
darling, it's the boys I have to worry about." Shortly before ditching 
the Ziggy persona for a white-suited soul identity, Bowie told reporters 
of his belief that, sooner or later, a rock singer would be assassinated 
onstage.
Haynes takes it from there. In his story, Brian Slade fakes his own 
onstage death, but is exposed as a fraud and falls from grace with fans. 
Ten years later, melancholy journalist Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) is 
assigned a "whatever happened to" story, and sets out to discover the 
final fate of Brian Slade. The "Citizen Kane" framework, while 
pretentious, provides the only successful facet of the production, with 
Bale offering a strong performance as a former glam fan whose painful 
memories of trying to make the glitter scene are stirred by the 
investigation.
With subject matter like this, Todd Haynes should have been able to turn 
out one hell of a juicy film, but "Velvet Goldmine" never takes flight. 
Instead of delving into the psyches of the characters, Haynes trots out a 
series of tedious rock videos, tacked together with preening actors, 
elaborate fashion shows and periodic make-out scenes between the boys. 
Having a bad actor in the lead role doesn't help matters. As Brian Slade, 
Jonathan Rhys Meyers is woefully inadequate, projecting zero charisma as 
he pouts his way through the movie. Never for a moment do you believe 
this kid could orchestrate his own superstardom.
Ewan McGregor is better as Curt Wild, an American rocker who is the 
object of Slade's affections. Wild is supposed to be modeled after 
legendary punk-burnout and Bowie protégé Iggy Pop, though McGregor's 
performance is more reminiscent of Kurt Cobain than Iggy. Incidentally, 
this is at least the third film featuring McGregor waggling his cock 
around, making him eligible for the Harvey Keitel Penis Exposure Hall Of 
Fame. 
In a supporting role, Toni Collette does what she can as Mandy, Slade's 
wife. She makes little impression during the flashbacks, but has a 
certain Marianne Faithfull ravaged survivor quality in the latter-day 
interview scenes set in a dingy pub. As Brian Slade's manager, Eddie 
Izzard merely growls and struts. 
"Velvet Goldmine" is maddening because it takes material with great 
potential and utterly wastes it. The glam rock era was a heady time, with 
its sexual experimentation, blurred gender lines, grandiose theatrics and 
knock-out music. Instead of probing the minds behind the phenomena, Todd 
Haynes settles for a gauzy surface glance; a tarted-up tribute without 
any oomph. "Velvet Goldmine" is to glam rock what the "Beatlemania" stage 
show was to the Beatles; just a bunch of poseurs going through the 
motions. David Bowie refused to let Haynes use his name or any of his 
music for the movie. Good for him. Hopefully, Bowie will wait until a 
filmmaker comes along with the chops to really do justice to the dizzying 
saga of Ziggy Stardust.

Review for Knock Off (1998)
Knock Off  (1998)

Wong. Directed by Tsui Hark. 90 minutes.

When the preview audience for "Knock Off" exited the theater, they were 
more demonstrative than any movie audience I have ever seen. Friends were 
taking turns trying to come up with the rudest possible one-liner to 
describe the movie. One young man held his arms above his head, making 
violent thumbs-down gestures with both hands while shouting, "Sucks! 
Sucks!" over and over. Most of the crowd simply walked out briskly, 
shaking their heads and loudly discussing how amazingly bad the film was. 
These people renewed my faith in humanity.
This piece will be relatively brief, because it seems foolish to spend 
more time writing the review for "Knock Off" than the authors spent 
writing the script. To put it as simply as possible, the film is, honest 
to God, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So bad that it left me 
mesmerized; transfixed in some quasi-hypnotic state of disbelief.
While hyping the film to Entertainment Weekly, Jean-Claude Van Damme told 
interviewers that his cocaine addiction was at its worst during the 
filming of "Knock Off." It shows. While his body remains muscular, Van 
Damme's face looks pallid and his expression dazed. He sweats a lot 
during scenes where he is just standing around talking. He looks like a 
heart-attack waiting to happen. School administrators could radically cut 
down on student drug use simply by forcing the kids to watch this film. 
Of course, that could land the school in court, because making students 
sit through "Knock Off" would probably be ruled as corporal punishment.
Set in Hong Kong just prior to its return to Chinese rule, the story 
involves miniature explosives, cut-rate imitations of designer jeans, CIA 
agents, lots of mobsters chasing each other around and loads of 
explosions. The specifics don't matter - they certainly didn't to the 
filmmakers. "Knock Off" is merely a long series of horribly filmed stunts,
 punctuated by poorly delivered one-liners and incomprehensible plot 
mechanics.
It begins with Van Damme huffing and puffing while pulling Rob Schneider 
in a rickshaw race, while Schneider whips him with a dead eel and shouts 
"move that beautiful ass!" Why? I have no idea. Toy dolls blow up in the 
waters near the harbor. Paul Sorvino and Lela Rochon show up to snarl and 
chase everyone around. A grossly obese mobster spews threats. Cars, boats 
and giant Buddha's explode. Van Damme's stunt double fights dozens of men,
 while Schneider makes a vain attempt at being an action hero and wormy 
smart-ass at the same time. And Van Damme, bless his heart, tries to act 
in a performance so wooden that it makes Ben Stein look animated by 
comparison.
Meanwhile, director Tsui Hark uses a dizzying array of camera tricks to 
try and hide the movie's myriad flaws. He sends the lens zooming up the 
barrel of a gun to focus on the shooter. His cameras swoop, swirl, twist 
and turn, especially during the action scenes. In fact, Hark shoots the 
action scenes using so many close-ups that he actually mutes any impact 
or sense of excitement the scenes might have had. The whole thing plays 
like a substandard episode of the "Power Rangers," except the Rangers are 
better actors.
Here's hoping Jean-Claude Van Damme succeeds in keeping off cocaine. 
Here's hoping Rob Schneider goes back to doing straight comedy. And 
finally, here's hoping you have the common sense to stay as far away from 
"Knock Off" as possible.

Review for House of Yes, The (1997)
The House Of Yes (1997)

Spelling
Rated R,  Four and one half stars (out of five stars)
Review and articles by Ed Johnson-Ott

On Thanksgiving eve, Jackie-O's eyes glisten as she tells her twin 
brother's fiancee, "I've been over the edge, now I'm back." She washes 
her anti-psychotic medication down with rum, noting that the pills are 
color-coordinated with her eyes. Surveying the goings-on, Jackie-O's 
mother excuses herself, saying, "I'm going to baste the turkey and hide 
the kitchen knives."
Welcome to "The House Of Yes," Mark Water's brilliant black comedy 
adapted from Wendy MacLeod's macabre play. "The House Of Yes" is a jewel, 
one of those rare and exhilarating films that completely realizes its own 
unique vision. 
The privileged  Pascal family inhabits a decaying Washington DC mansion, 
insulated from the rules of the outside world. Marty (Josh Hamilton) is 
the only family member to leave home since his father disappeared on the 
day John F. Kennedy was killed. When the young man returns with his 
fiancee, a Donut King hostess named Lesly (Tori Spelling), he hopes to 
introduce a little normality to the home. Nice try, Marty. His 
otherworldly mother (Genevieve Bujold) takes Lesly into the kitchen for a 
little chat, casually informing her that "Jackie was holding Marty's 
penis when they came out of the womb." After a storm knocks the lights 
out and Mom retires to her room, we learn more about the kids. Jackie-O 
(Parker Posey) and Marty have been lovers for years, reenacting the 
Kennedy assassination as foreplay.
You see, Jackie-O has this thing about the Kennedy's, routinely donning a 
pink suit, pearls and a pill box hat to emulate the former First Lady. 
While Jackie-O frantically tries to draw Marty back into her arms, 
Lesly's time is occupied by the twins' shy, eager-to-please younger 
brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who spills the beans about his 
siblings' romance, then wheedles Lesly to help him lose his virginity. 
Just to be fair, you should know that after this mundane stuff has been 
established, things get a little weird.
"The House Of Yes" has a delightfully creepy feel. It's like finally 
finding out what the Addams Family REALLY did behind closed doors. The 
whole thing could easily have become campy, smug or just too damn 
precious, but Waters' manages the mean trick of keeping this story 
emotionally grounded. By directing the actors playing the Pascal family 
to maintain a sense of heightened reality, he highlights just how 
isolated the Pascals are. With their mansion serving as some plush 
sensory deprivation tank, the family is cut off from life, damned by 
their own lack of self-restraint to live a hollow existence of melodrama 
and role-playing.
Water's couldn't have pulled this film off without skilled actors, and 
the cast of "House Of Yes" is superb. You'll immediately notice Parker 
Posey's triumphant turn as the whacked-out Jackie-O, but pay attention to 
the other performances as well. Genevieve Bujold creates a matriarch who 
is regal, snobby, droll and distracted in a truly odd, disturbing fashion.
 Josh Hamilton is a perfect yang to Jackie-O's yin. Watch his face when 
she tries to convince him to drop his attempts at a traditional life and 
return to the loony bed. Hamilton conveys a stunning transition of 
attitude using only his eyes and subtle changes in facial expression. He 
is exceptional. Tori Spelling conveys a charming naivete as a simple girl 
who "smells like powdered donuts." The real scene stealer, though, is 
Freddie Prinze Jr., who initially appears to be merely an ancillary 
character, but comes into his own with a sly, remarkably skilled 
performance. Watch him closely during Anthony's attempted seduction of 
Leslie. This boy can ACT.
While adroitly mixing humor and horror, Waters' plays games with your 
head. When Jackie-O begs Marty for some Dallas motorcade sex, you find 
yourself hoping he will agree. When Anthony tries to bed his brother's 
fiancee, you hope that he'll succeed. Is Waters trying to make a case for 
incest and stealing your brother's girl? Of course not. He is taking the 
audience, isolated in a movie theater, and showing us how easy it is to 
be seduced into wrong thinking by attractive, charming people while we're 
cut off from the rest of the world. Just like the Pascals.
At least that's my spin on it. Part of the beauty of "The House Of Yes" 
is that there are infinite ways to interpret the material. As the film 
makes its way across the country, it's proving to be one of those love-it-
or-hate-it movies. That's the way it usually works with innovative films, 
and "The House Of Yes" is certainly innovative. Shocking in its 
originality, it is funny, frightening, thought-provoking and one of the 
years best films.  
******* Interview with "House Of Yes" director Mark Waters *************
Ready for the anti-Camelot? In "The House Of Yes," a brilliant black 
comedy directed by South Bend native Mark Waters, we meet the Pascals, a 
privileged family who live in a Washington DC mansion, an insulated world 
where absolutely nothing is out of bounds. On November 22, 1963, at the 
same time President Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Pascal abruptly 
disappeared from his family. Twenty years later, young Marty Pascal (Josh 
Hamilton) returns home for the holidays with new fiancee Lesly (Tori 
Spelling) by his side, ready to introduce her to the rest of the family; 
his regal, otherworldly mother (Genevieve Bujold,) younger brother 
Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Marty's twin sister, Jackie-O (Parker 
Posey,) a beautiful, totally whacked out young woman with an intense 
fixation on the former first lady, and a very unique relationship with 
her twin brother. The dark psychological comedy is based on Wendy 
MacLeod's play of the same name.
"In 1990, when I first encountered the play in San Francisco, I wasn't a 
film person," explained Waters in a telephone interview. "I was a 
theatrical actor and director. I didn't go for straight plays generally, 
I liked things a lot more stylized, yet when I saw this play I really 
loved it because it had this kind of expressionistic stylization to it 
and a bleeding of genres. It was a really funny black comedy, an extreme 
and exciting suspense play and a powerful tragic drama as well. I loved 
it because it was very ambitious and achieved most everything it went for.
 I got a copy of the play from Wendy MacLeod's agent and put it aside 
until years later, after I'd gone to film school. I realized that with 
only five actors and one location, I could make this into a film on very 
little money, while dealing with an exciting, full piece of material."
Creating a dark comedy that pulls humor from taboo themes wasn't easy. 
Handled wrong, the film could easily have become smug or too clever for 
its own good, but Waters established a delicate balance that makes the 
material sing. "It started with the adaptation," he said. "I stripped 
down the play quite a bit, taking out a lot of dialogue that was just 
repartee for repartees sake; lines that didn't really add to the 
characters or the story. I also restructured the scenes so that things 
didn't happen without an emotional justification for them occurring. I 
imposed a dramatic texture or structure which wasn't there before and 
then adjusted the scenes so there would be emotional connections 
throughout the material. 
"The next part was really the casting. Parker, Josh, Freddie, Tori and, 
of course, Genevieve Bujold are all incredibly talented. I chose them 
because they were genuinely likable and charming, with a natural sense of 
acting. Even with Parker Posey's character, we tried to have her be more 
emotionally grounded than in most of her other roles and she relished the 
opportunity to do that more intimate kind of acting. We didn't want to 
veer off into camp, like the 'Addams Family' or 'Fassbinder,' where 
everything is so cold and dark that people wouldn't be able to engage the 
characters. When I started the adaptation, Wendy told me that it could 
work if it had high style with emotional truth. So in the movie, I 
decided we would have a level of stylization. We established a slightly 
heightened reality, without losing the emotional truth. The audience is 
able to stay with the characters as human beings even while watching them 
take things to unreal extremes at times.
"There's a scene in the dining room, where Jackie-O is at Marty's knees. 
She says "When you make love to that Lesly girl, do you see my face?" and 
Marty says "Sometimes." The movie is working well when the audience goes 
right along with them, wanting him to say yes, wanting him to acknowledge 
his love for Jackie. Then suddenly they think "Wait a second! They're 
brother and sister, I shouldn't be wanting this!" but at the same time 
they can't help but truly empathize and sympathize with the characters. 
It's one of the most crucial scenes in the movie. Going into shooting, I 
didn't know if we'd be able to pull it off. But both of those actors just 
stepped right up to the plate and did it. It's a very difficult, subtle 
thing to get the audience to sympathize with something they would 
normally find taboo and scary."
Incestuous sibling romances aside, one of the most controversial aspects 
of "The House Of Yes," which appears under the banner of Spelling Films, 
was the casting of Tori Spelling. Waters laughed about the fuss, saying, 
"I had no real awareness of Tori before I cast her. I don't watch TV much,
 except for "Seinfeld" and "Friends," and I'd never seen "Beverly Hills 
90210." When I read with her I was completely smitten. She was perfect 
for Leslie; shy, sweet and vulnerable. All I knew of her is that she was 
kind of a celebrity. I didn't know about all the baggage associated with 
her until we got to the Sundance Film Festival and we started getting 
reviews saying things like "a surprisingly capable Tori Spelling" and I 
thought "Wow, these people really have a chip on their shoulder about her."
 It was only months after the film was completed that I became aware of 
the charges of nepotism that have followed her through her career. 
Spelling Film's involvement with the piece came very late in the game. 
Aaron Spelling said he'd read the script, thought it was absolutely 
hilarious and wanted to acquire the movie, which was nice because we were 
all working on deferment and actually getting paid was great. If I'd been 
aware of all that nepotism charges, I would have insisted we stick with 
our old funding sources. But in the end Spelling Films was happy because 
they put their money behind a successful film, and Tori's happy because 
she got a chance to show her skills.
Waters is excited about his next project, "Strike." "It's also going to 
be a Miramax project; we're finalizing the contract and I'm about to get 
into the casting. It's great being a second time filmmaker because you 
don't have to struggle so much for money. The film is kind of set in 
Indiana, a mythical Midwestern High School based on my experiences. They 
were starting busing when I was going to school and I lifted the premise 
for the film from the Greek play 'Lysistrata' which is about a war 
between Athens and Sparta where the women get together and decide to 
withhold sex from the men in order to stop the war. I've set the story in 
a high school during a racial gang war where the black girls and the 
white girls get together and decide they're going to stop putting out, 
withholding sex from the boys to try and stop the violence. It's another 
black comedy, but the tone is different from 'The House Of Yes.'"
This year has seen three films with Indiana connections, all dealing with 
dark topics. Asked about the other films, Waters said, "'The House Of 
Yes' is a dark comedy, yet we're actually lighter than those other two 
movies. When you think about it, that's really pretty funny. 'Going All 
The Way' and 'In The Company Of Men' were my two favorite films at 
Sundance and it was just coincidental that they had the Indiana 
connection."
For her performance in "The House Of Yes," Parker Posey received a 
Special Acting Award at the Sundance Film Festival. 
******* Interview with Freddie Prinze Jr. from "The House Of Yes" 
********
When Freddie Prinze Jr., who plays Anthony, the younger brother in "The 
House Of Yes," walked in front of the crowd at a promotional appearance 
in Hollywood, he was visibly uncomfortable. As the cameras flashed and 
the emcee asked inane questions, Prinze looked desperate to get out of 
the room. Later, he discussed the evening. "To be honest, I'm still kind 
of learning how to do the celebrity stuff. It's not what I got into the 
business for, and I'm not very good at it. With people shouting Freddie! 
Freddie!' and sometimes even calling me Mr. Prinze,' it feels really 
strange. I understand it's part of the job, but I'm not good at it."
The talented young actor is far more comfortable discussing his work, 
particularly his outstanding turn in "The House Of Yes." "Anthony is kind 
of like Norman Bates before his Mom had the motel. He's so nice, yet has 
his own agenda. He can get manipulated, but at the same time he's very 
manipulative. The role was tricky because you don't want to give away too 
much at first."
The House Of Yes is a very intimate film, with the camera moving ever 
closer to the actor's faces as the story proceeds, which called for 
subtle performances from the cast. "I always worked from the gut, and 
this role called for me to play things mostly through my eyes, so I had 
to re-train myself. Parker Posey establishes a distinct tone, she's the 
thread between the beginning and the end of the movie and everybody 
revolves around Jackie-O, so you have to adjust your style so that 
everything meshes.
"My first job ever a three line role on Family Matters with Urkel," he 
laughed. "I was Burt the punk. I didn't even get a last name, just Burt 
the punk." Prinze also appeared in "To Gillian On Her 37th Birthday" and 
the current "I Know What You Did Last Summer." "It was so satisfying 
doing a film like The House Of Yes.' Mark Waters, the director, was like 
a kid in a candy store. It was his first film and he'd get so into scenes 
that he'd forget to say cut. We actually finished a half day ahead of 
schedule, which is amazing for an independent film. I'm really happy 
about the reception the film is getting. It's definitely the role I'm 
most proud of and it's gratifying when people respond well to it"

"The Blair Witch Project" opens with a title card that reads "In October 
of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near 
Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their 
footage was found." That's all you really need to know before viewing 
this ingenious, extremely creepy horror movie. Shot with two shaky hand-
held cameras on a shoestring budget, "The Blair Witch Project" works 
because the creators remembered that the most effective of all special 
effects is the human imagination. 
With very little money (roughly $25,000) to work from, filmmakers Eduardo 
Sanchez and Daniel Myrick decided to turn lemons into lemonade, 
constructing a storyline that would transform their financial and 
technical limitations into assets. The result is a "mockumentary" about 
the shooting of a documentary. 
Heather Donahue, a film student and aspiring director, sets off to 
explore the legend of the Blair Witch, an 18th century woman who 
supposedly haunts the Black Hills Forest of Maryland, periodically 
reaching out from the netherworld to strike at those who trespass on her 
domain. Heather is accompanied by two fellow students: cameraman and 
friend Joshua Leonard and sound operator Michael Williams. While Joshua 
shoots documentary footage on 16mm black and white film, Heather records 
virtually everything on video, for use in a "The Making Of" feature about 
their movie.
After playfully filming each other and interviewing some locals, the trio 
heads off to search for the sight where the legend began, only to get 
lost in the woods. Hours grow into days, supplies grow scarce, tensions 
increase, and then the kids start hearing these strange noises... 
Setting the story in 1994 was smart. While firmly in our high-tech age, 
the year predates, just barely, the current climate where having a pocket 
cell phone is de rigueur for those under 30, so the idea of the three 
truly being cut-off from the outside world is plausible. Yet 1994 is 
recent enough to encompass the mentality of shows like "The Real World," 
so Heather's insistence on keeping the cameras running even when the 
situation becomes extremely dire is not that much of a stretch. After all,
 the more dangerous things get, the more important it is to continue 
filming because, as the "Real World" mindset goes, we are all potential 
stars if, and only if, our lives provide enough high drama.
The casting of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard was 
equally inspired. All three actors (their actual names are used in the 
film, adding to the "is this real?" mystique) have a genuine quality 
crucial in making the production seem believable. Heather is determined, 
over-confident and a bit pushy; required traits for a director-in-the-
making. When she tapes an introduction to the documentary, her delivery 
is self-conscious and a tad stilted, exactly what one would expect from a 
student filmmaker. 
Even though he is working with a friend, Joshua remains reticent, clearly 
more comfortable filming the action than being a part of it. As the 
outsider, Michael is the wild card of the group. The extremely likable 
young man does his best to cooperate with the others, despite his 
discomfort at being stuck in the middle of nowhere with two people he 
barely knows.  
I cared about the fates of these individuals and found myself hoping 
against hope that they would somehow avoid the fate predicted by the 
title card. "The Blair Witch Project" deftly creates a sense of dread 
that grows steadily as events progress, with the shaky camerawork, 
obscured views and limited night-lighting effectively amplifying the 
disorientating ambiance.  
To a degree, the actors actually experienced those feelings. They were 
left alone in a Maryland state park for extended periods of time, filming 
themselves and improvising their dialogue based on directoral notes left 
at prearranged drop points. The unnerving sounds they heard were provided 
by the directors, who would periodically sneak around the actors' 
campsites in the middle of the night. 
On Internet film newsgroups, where arguing and sniping is the norm, a 
debate rages between devotees of the movie and those who consider the 
production nothing more than an over-hyped gimmick. To be sure, there has 
been a great amount of hype for the film, but so what? Convincing a mass 
audience to try out a low-budget independent flick is a tough chore and 
the folks behind "Blair Witch" have used clever promotion to create a 
whale of an advance buzz. And the finished product delivers the goods. 
"The Blair Witch Project" is much more than a gimmick. Eduardo Sanchez 
and Daniel Myrick have crafted a horror film that is genuinely 
disquieting, because they understand that no matter how much money 
studios throw into lurid nightmare imagery, the scariest monsters are 
those who lurk just out of sight, in the dark recesses of our own minds.

Review for Hard Rain (1998)
Hard Rain (1998)
Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver, Betty White.
 Directed by Mikael Salomon.
2.5 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/

It would be easy to dismiss the entertaining, but decidedly lightweight 
action film "Hard Rain" as mere fluff, were it not for the memories of 
last summer's dreadful "Speed 2: Cruise Control." That leaden monstrosity 
served as a primer on how to screw up an action movie. Bloated and dull, 
"Speed 2" was two hours of forced spectacle and frantic movement that 
generated little tension and virtually no fun. Conversely, "Hard Rain" 
takes a simple concept and turns it into an unassuming, efficient action 
film. Sure, you'll probably forget about it an hour or so after you've 
left the theater, but at least you'll have a good time while you're in 
there.
Set in Huntingburg, Indiana, "Hard Rain" is about an armored car heist 
and a whole lot of water. After flood waters force the evacuation of the 
small town, the local sheriff (Randy Quaid) and his deputies patrol by 
boat, searching for any local stragglers and keeping an eye out for 
looters. Meanwhile, an armored car breaks down on the outskirts of town, 
stranding drivers Tom (Christian Slater) and his Uncle Charlie (Ed Asner.
) A radio call for help results in the arrival of Jim (Morgan Freeman) 
and his crew, but their goal isn't assistance. They want the armored 
car's treasure, $3 million in cash. When the "rescue team" opens fire, 
Tom snatches the money and takes off on foot into the ever-deepening 
waters. The chase is on, with everyone pursuing Tom. Shifting allegiances 
and some snazzy action sequences keep the proceedings lively, as the 
flood waters continue rising higher and higher.
Water is notoriously hard to handle, so the creators of "Hard Rain" moved 
the production into a contained environment, building an extremely 
detailed replica of Huntingburg in a massive aircraft hangar in Palmdale, 
California. 50 wooden buildings were set in a tank two football fields 
long and one football field wide. Behind the faux downtown setting, the 
largest backdrop ever made, 72-feet high and 2,000 feet long, completed 
the Huntingburg re-creation. Then the whole set was flooded with five 
feet of water, deep enough for the actors to flail about convincingly, 
but shallow enough to allow them to find their footing when necessary. To 
simulate the rising floodwaters, the filming was divided into several 
stages. At the end of each sequence, all of the structures were lifted 
into the air, allowing crew members to cut away the bottom portions of 
the buildings. When the sets were lowered, the illusion of rising waters 
was complete. Ultimately, flood waters 16 feet deep were simulated for 
the production.
After finishing 75 days of shooting on the Palmdale set, the crew finally 
moved to the real Huntingburg, for a week of outdoor location filming. 
For the first time in Indiana history, a highway was closed to traffic 
for filming, as sandbags were placed at the junction of Interstate 231 
and Main Street, which was then covered with a few inches of water to 
simulate the early stages of the flood. 
"Hard Rain" was originally called "The Flood" and was scheduled for 
release last summer, but the film was pulled from the schedule and the 
name changed due to fears it would be mistaken as a disaster movie. In 
press materials, producer Mark Gordon stressed the difference between 
"Hard Rain" and a disaster film. "In those type of stories, the twister, 
flood or volcano serves as the antagonist. In our picture, Morgan Freeman 
is the antagonist, Christian Slater is the protagonist and we play out 
the action against the flood."
The action gets pretty spectacular, highlighted by two particularly nice 
set pieces; a jet ski chase through the flooded halls of a school, and a 
nifty dual speedboat crash through the stained-glass windows of a church. 
The acting isn't bad, either. Christian Slater mercifully avoids his 
chronic Jack Nicholson impersonation, underplaying Tom in straightforward 
heroic fashion. Morgan Freeman is grimly effective as the very focused 
leader of the bad guys, and Randy Quaid puts his snarky qualities to good 
use as the town's morally ambiguous sheriff. Minnie Driver, excellent in 
"Good Will Hunting," has a minor, but pleasing turn as a restoration 
expert who reluctantly gets drawn into the action, and Betty White makes 
an amusing cameo appearance as a feisty local who refuses to vacate her 
home. 
Despite the qualifications of the cast, don't look for any deep personal 
insights. Like its storyline, the characters in "Hard Rain" are 
streamlined; archetypal players making fast decisions in a volatile 
situation. "Hard Rain" is simply an action movie, but it has a certain 
elegance because of its lack of bombast or pretension. They're just 
trying to show us a good time here and, bless their little hearts, that's 
exactly what they do.

It's hard not to recommend "The Others." The supernatural thriller,
written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar ("Open Your Eyes"), adroitly
establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace. The
cinematography, by Javier Aguirresarobe, is as good as I have ever seen
and Nicole Kidman gives another in her growing body of fine
performances. But the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to
downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than
satisfied.
Overall, the film plays like a very high quality version of any number
of old "Twilight Zone" episodes where the characters spend a great deal
of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented, only to learn
they are actually a child's toy, a military test subject or a department
store dummy. Watching those vintage shows and listening to the players
chatter, I always wanted to shout, "Get on with it!" As much as I
appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "The Others," my reaction was
much the same.
Set at an island mansion off the coast of England during World War II,
the story focuses on Grace (Kidman), who tends to her children Anne
(Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) and worries about her
husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston), a missing serviceman. Anne and
Nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and Grace patrols the estate with
the keys to all 50 doors, protecting the little ones from excess light
by making sure that only one door is open at a time.
At the beginning of the film, three servants, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula
Flanagan), young, mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and Mr. Tuttle (Eric
Sykes), an aging gardener, join the family. The two that speak seem
agreeable enough at first, but it soon becomes apparent that they know
something that Grace does not. To make matters worse, the children are
upset: Nicholas is unusually jittery and Anne claims to be seeing
ghosts. Grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her
home, only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them.
That's essentially the whole story, with the tension growing until the
pivotal moment when everything becomes clear. Earlier, there is an
outstanding scene where Grace darts outside, only to be enveloped in
fold after fold of shimmering fog. The visuals in the otherworldly
sequence, courtesy of Aguirresarobe, are simply astounding.
I also enjoyed the presence of religion, a rarity in films dealing with
the supernatural. Grace is a Christian and answers her children's
questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper.
When mother is away, though, the kids speculate whether her statements
are fact or folklore, just as real children do.
But those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make
up for a lackluster ending. "The Others" sets out to be a classic ghost
story, but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films
more than layers of mist.

The spirited comedy "Galaxy Quest," which follows the has-been crew of
an old "Star Trek" style TV show when they get scooped up by a group
of aliens who mistake them for genuine interstellar heroes, would make
a fine companion piece to the light-hearted documentary, "Trekkies."
Both films look at the people who attend sci-fi conventions, from
hopelessly typecast actors who depend on the gatherings for their
bread and butter, to those fans who dress up like their heroes and
sometimes appear to have trouble recognizing the line between reality
and pretend. Both productions are rather slight affairs, choosing to
mostly stay on the surface level rather than digging a little
deeper. And both movies are far more entertaining than one would ever
expect them to be.
The story begins many years after the cancellation of "Galaxy Quest,"
a cheesy TV show quite similar to the original "Star Trek"
series. Desperate for work, the cast travels the sci-fi convention
circuit; signing autographs, posing for photos and dealing with
impossibly obscure trivia questions from devoted fans. When a group of
folks in odd uniforms ask series star Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) to
help save their people from a galactic meanie, the actor takes their
words as a proposal for a paying gig in some dorky role-playing game.
He's wrong. The "fans" are bona fide aliens assuming human form,
members of a gentle species called Thermians. These sweet creatures,
with no understanding of the concept of fiction, perceived the
transmissions of "Galaxy Quest" they picked up through space to be
documentaries of historic events. So when the evil space pirate Sarris
(Robin Sachs, decked out like a giant grasshopper with Borg
accessories) assaults their race, they turn to the valiant "Galaxy
Quest" crew for help. To make things easier for their heroes, they've
even built a full-scale working duplicate of the vessel used in the TV
show, unaware that the original ship was nothing but a tiny model. In
short order, the stunned "Galaxy Quest" cast find themselves in the
cosmos, with the fate of a race in their hands.
The high-concept premise works because of some clever set pieces,
imaginative special effects and appealing performances from the
cast. Tim Allen is fun as the "Galaxy Quest" Commander, an
overstuffed, insensitive egocentric actor clearly modeled after "Star
Trek's" William Shatner. The "Trek" parallels continue with his
cast-mates. Sigourney Weaver, decked out in a blond wig, is this
crew's Uhuru, the token female relegated to repeating computer
commands. Alan Rickman draws big laughs as the Spock of the group, a
bitter performer stuck under alien make-up who has always believed the
show to be beneath his talents ("I'm a Shakespearean actor!" he
complains). Daryl Mitchell is fine as the now-grown actor who played
the plucky kid on the old series.
Tony Shalhoub absolutely steals the show as Fred Kwan, the most
adaptive of the "Galaxy Quest" cast. In the show, he played a
character of Asian heritage, despite the fact that he obviously wasn't
(Scotty? Chekov? Take your pick). In the cast's real-life outer space
adventure, he is absolutely unflappable, and Shalhoub's low-key line
readings are hilarious. Sam Rockwell, fresh from a maniacal turn in
"The Green Mile," is a hoot as a hanger-on who once played a nameless
crewman killed in the first act of an episode (think of anyone in a
red-shirt on "Star Trek"). Rockwell spends most of the film expecting
to be knocked off for cheap dramatic effect.
While "Galaxy Quest" mines sci-fi clichés for lots of laughs, it
could have been funnier had the writers thrown in even more pop
culture references for die-hard fans. The film plays like a
straightforward first-season episode of "The Simpsons," before the
writers hit their stride and began to stuff the series with too many
gags to take in on the initial viewing. Still, the movie is
refreshingly benign (due in large part to the naďve, lovable
Thermians) and does contain some surprisingly subtle observations
(when placed on the real spaceship, the cast members immediately fall
into their old roles, as if they were locked in some TV character
caste system). As comedies go, "Galaxy Quest" may not reach its full
potential, but it's a fine way to while away 104 minutes.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Initially, my expectations for "The Cell" were low, primarily because of
its mid-August release date. August is the month studios traditionally
use to burn off those movies they consider too anemic to compete against
the big summer flicks and too insubstantial to face off against headier
autumn fare.
Then Roger Ebert got me all stirred up. On his weekly TV show (which the
local affiliate thoughtfully airs on Saturday nights at 3:30 a.m.),
Ebert and his new partner raved about the production, calling it one of
the best movies of the year. After gushing over the eye-popping visuals,
they went on to praise the story, claiming that it worked on multiple
levels.
I'm glad Roger and his comrade in arms had such a fine time. As for me,
"The Cell" turned out to be just another late summer disappointment,
filled with flashy images and little substance.
Created by award-winning commercial and music video maker Tarsem Singh
(he now bills himself simply as Tarsem, you know, like Charo), the film
comes off like a grisly, feature-length perfume commercial with
delusions of grandeur. What a drag.
Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine Deane, a psychologist involved in an
ultra high tech form of therapy. Using a whiz bang machine, she can
enter the subconscious of her patients. Decked out in a body suit that
appears to be made of red Twizzlers, Catherine closes her eyes and
awakens in the dreamscapes of her clients, where she wanders through
trippy MTV style video sets, dispensing psychological bromides while
wearing the kind of outfits that Cher and Madonna trot out for award
shows.
The story begins within the mind of Edward Baines (Colton James), a
comatose little boy. Set against blue skies and majestic desert sand
dunes, we watch as Catherine tries to win the trust of the child, hoping
to eventually draw him back to the real world. The segment is
impressively shot and, unfortunately, the high point of the film.
While Catherine strolls through the psychic Sahara, whacked out serial
killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) wages a terror campaign outside
the lab, torturing women to death and then turning their corpses into
animated dolls.
After the lunatic is captured and falls into a coma (how convenient),
straight arrow FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) turns to Catherine
and her comrades for help. Somewhere, Carl's latest victim, Julia
Hickson (Tara Subkoff) is trapped in a huge torture tank that fills with
water every few hours. The young woman is destined for a horrible death,
unless Catherine can enter his mind and discover the location of the
lethal aquarium. The bulk of the movie hops between Catherine's forays
into the killer's cranium and disturbing shots of a frantic Julia trying
not to drown.
The makings of a solid film are present, but Tarsem is so fixated on
creating groovy tripscapes that he neglects everything else. While
Julia's situation remains dire, there is no sense of danger with any of
the principal players. Character development is virtually nonexistent,
leaving Lopez and Vaughn stuck in one-dimensional roles.
Despite setting much of the film in Carl's deranged brain, the story
stays at a Psych 101 level. Catherine attempts to build a rapport with
Carl's inner child, learning that the killer was abused as a boy.
Meanwhile, the adult Carl skulks about, sporting a series of
over-the-top costumes that Elton John would surely die to own.
When Spike Jonze ventured into the mind of another person in the
wonderful "Being John Malkovich," he was smart enough to realize that
outrageous ideas are best presented in a low key, matter-of-fact
fashion. Tarsem seems incapable of turning off the flash. Even in the
real world scenes, he uses swooping camera shots, jump cuts to extreme
close-ups and other visual stunts. As a result, nothing in the film
feels genuine.
To make matters worse, the subconscious segments suffer from overkill.
Too often, Carl's costumes, created by April Napier and Japanese
designer Eiko Ishioka, appear more silly than imposing. As for the
general look, imagine REM's "Losing My Religion" video (also directed by
Tarsem), magnify the excesses by 10, toss in some gross out footage and
you'll know what to expect.
Ultimately, "The Cell" is little more than creepy, vapid eye candy, with
a story barely grafted on. Ads for the movie use a quote describing the
production as "'The Matrix' meets 'Silence of the Lambs.'" What a load
of crap. "The Cell" lacks the imagination, excitement and thrust of the
former film, and the character development and storytelling expertise of
the latter, leaving viewers staring at an overlong, inert music video
peopled with lavishly costumed characters all dressed up with nowhere to
go.

The first question, of course, is why? Why take a Saturday Night Live 
sketch that was annoying, repetitive and dull in its three-minute form 
and expand it into a feature-length film? The few SNL sketches that made 
financially or artistically successful transitions to the big screen 
(''The Blues Brothers,'' "Wayne's World'' and Al Franken's 
underappreciated comedy/drama ''Stuart Saves His Family") were based on 
characters who were at least interesting. The most painful SNL movies 
("The Coneheads" and "It's Pat") sprung from one note characters in one 
joke sketches. 
In the case of the Butabi brothers, we're talking about half note 
characters in no joke sketches. For those of you lucky enough to have 
missed their endless SNL appearances, here's a complete description of 
the sketches. Dressed in bad outfits, the boys bop their heads to a disco 
tune and bash their bodies into startled women. That's it. Which again 
begs the question, why, why, why make a movie out of this?
Enough whining. They made one and my job description dictated that I see 
it, then write about it, so here we go. "A Night at the Roxbury" is bad. 
There are infrequent humorous moments, a few good supporting performances 
and a genuinely funny wedding scene, but these are most certainly not 
enough to salvage this sad little movie.
Here's the run-down. Steve and Doug Butabi are two clueless losers who 
accost women in the few L.A. nightclubs that will grant them entry. Steve 
(Will Ferrell) is a nervous breakdown waiting to happen and Doug (the 
reptilian Chris Kattan) is his surly brother, angry over the second class 
treatment he receives from his father. The boys live with their folks 
(Dan Hedaya and Loni Anderson) and work in Pop's artificial flower store. 
Dwayne Hickman, manager of the neighboring lamp store, is anxious to pair 
his daughter (Molly Shannon) with Steve, and father Butabi loves the idea,
 envisioning an expansion of his store should the union ever occur.
The brothers finally gain entry to the trendy Roxbury when Richard Grieco,
 anxious to avoid a lawsuit after rear-ending the boys' vehicle, ushers 
them into the nightclub. They bond with club owner Chazz Palminteri and 
pitch their peculiar idea for a disco (don't ask), while Colin Quinn, the 
owner's right hand man, glowers in the background. Two opportunistic 
women latch onto the brothers. Quinn keeps the boys away from Palminteri. 
Dad cuts off their use of the car, the brothers become estranged, a 
wedding is arranged, blah, blah, blah.
The film's only redeeming moments come with the wedding scene, which 
offers genuinely funny references to "The Graduate," "Say Anything" and 
"Jerry Maguire." Molly Shannon's performance as a sexually assertive 
young woman is appealing, as are cameos from former "Kid in the Hall" 
Mark McKinney and Lochlyn Munro (whose spirited work as Cliff salvaged 
the otherwise disposable "Dead Man on Campus"). 
Aside from that, the film offers virtually no rewards, although I found 
Ferrell and Kattan's desperate attempts to add depth to their empty 
characters perversely fascinating. I also found it impossible to take my 
eyes off Richard Grieco, looking doughy and smarmy in a frightening cameo.
When "A Night at the Roxbury" hits cable, it might be worth a viewing, if 
only to see the depths reached by Lorne Michaels' latter day SNL projects.
 Until then, stay as far away from the Roxbury as you possibly can. Don't 
reward drivel like this with your hard-earned dollars.

It's the early 1920s and German silent filmmaker F.W. Murnau is about to
make the world's first vampire movie. His script is ready and he's
assembled a top-notch cast and crew willing to follow him on an eerie
location shoot in Eastern Europe. What they don't know is that, in order
to make his production as realistic as possible, Murnau has done
something quite unusual. For the crucial lead role in the horror epic,
he's hired a real vampire.
"Shadow of the Vampire" takes a skewed look at the making of the seminal
film, "Nosferatu," and the determination of the legendary director
behind it. While the movie fumbles when trying to make grand statements
about the creative process, it works very well as a straightforward
black comedy and homage to early cinema.
"Nosferatu" seems a natural for fanciful speculation. Details are
sketchy on the life of F.W. Murnau, who made 22 films before dying in a
car wreck at the age of 42 (according to Kenneth Anger's "Hollywood
Babylon," the driver of the car was an underage Filipino lad that Murnau
was "servicing" when the Packard leapt off the road). Murnau based his
most well-known film on Bram Stoker's "Dracula," but had to change the
character names due to legal problems with Stoker's estate. So Count
Dracula became Count Orlock, a feral thing light years from the elegant
Prince of Darkness that became a cinema standard a decade later. Orlock
was played by Max Schreck, once described as "an actor of little
distinction." Virtually nothing is known about the man.
Screenwriter Steven Katz found the mystery captivating. "About 10 or 11
years ago I became very interested in 'Nosferatu,'" he said. "I
especially liked the fact that the film looks incredibly realistic  to
the point that you almost think you are watching an old documentary
about a vampire. I then got the idea of what would happen if the actor
playing the vampire in the film was really a vampire. As it happens,
Schreck is the German word for shriek or fright  it seemed a little too
pat. I started to do some research on Murnau and I saw this amazing
picture of him filming  all his crew were wearing lab coats and
goggles. From that I got the idea of Murnau really treating the whole
thing as a documentary, as a scientific project."
Enter "Shadow of the Vampire" director E. Elias Merhige, who dutifully
outfits his "filmmakers" in lab coats and goggles while recreating the
look of "Nosferatu." The story is as simple as the conceit is ingenious,
following the production of the film, with Murnau explaining to his cast
that Schreck is a fiercely dedicated method actor, trained by
Stanislavsky himself, who will only appear in full make-up, at night,
while remaining in character. In fact, Murnau has cut a deal with his
vampire star; if he behaves until the film is completed, he will be
rewarded with the leading lady's neck. Schreck can't manage to control
himself, of course, leading to horror and gallows humor as Murnau
struggles to finish his opus before his star finishes the cast and crew.
None of this could work without the right actors and "Shadow of the
Vampire" boasts a fine group, led by John Malkovich as Murnau and Willem
Dafoe as Schreck. Actually, the teaming of Malkovich and Dafoe, two
phenomenally talented, but decidedly creepy performers, is a scary
notion all by itself. Had Merhige also hired Steve Buscemi and
Christopher Walken, he could have made a horror film without a script
simply by outfitting the four men in black and saying, "Okay boys,
mingle."
Malkovich is at his reptilian best as the perfectionist director, but is
burdened by having to recite lines intended to make a statement about
creative obsession, stilted lines like "If it isn't in the frame, it
doesn't exist." Dafoe, on the other hand, gets to deliver one juicy
sentence after another in the role of a lifetime. He finds the perfect
pitch for Schreck, playing the character broadly without ever going over
the top. In one wonderful scene, he explains that the romance of the
Dracula novel saddens him, because real vampires, by nature, end up
detached from mankind. "Can he even remember how to buy bread?" Schreck
muses. "How to select wine and cheese?" At that moment, the monster
becomes more human than anyone else in the story, which highlights the
weakness of the film.
Despite a tendency to confuse glibness with substance, "Shadow of the
Vampire" is still a treat, courtesy of its clever premise, rich music
and cinematography, and an enthusiastic cast gleefully overdoing their
German accents. Fans of "Nosferatu" can rejoice. Thanks to the
extraordinary efforts of Willem Dafoe, Max Schreck lives.

Review for End of Days (1999)

with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Hollywood never fails to astound me. Every time I think those coked-up
little buggers have hit rock bottom; they come up with a new
excavating tool. I was truly convinced that "Wild Wild West" marked
1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless, but then along comes "End
of Days" to prove me wrong. This big budget, brain dead apocalyptic
thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music, grisly
violence, explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects. The
result? Nothing but groans and yawns. Even the Devil himself is unable
to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept. At the very
least, "End of Days" should have done us the courtesy of being
bad-enough-to-be-good, but it can't even manage that. It's just lousy.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, still recovering from heart problems and
"Batman & Robin," plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard
or something. Along with his obligatory comic relief partner (Kevin
Pollak, impersonating Matthew Perry's Chandler character from
"Friends"), he gets involved in some major league supernatural
hoodoo. It seems that Satan (Gabriel Byrne) gets a shot at world
domination only once every thousand years (and here I thought he'd
pulled it off with the Republican landslide of '94). If he has sex
with 20-year old Christine York (Robin Tunney), "the Chosen One,"
their child will be the Antichrist, or at least a brat.
Ah, but this deal has more catches than a New Year's Eve pass from a
Halfway House. The unholy union must take place on December 31, 1999
(you see, 999 is just 666 turned upside down), but only between 11
p.m. and Midnight (no wonder this guy is so cranky). And if the Chosen
One is given refuge in a church, the devil won't know where she is,
because he can't see into the sanctuary. You know, it's kind of like
Superman's X-ray vision and lead walls, only evil.
A group of guerrilla Catholic priests decide the best way to stop the
situation is by killing the girl. Arnold chooses to save the girl and
kick the hell out of Satan, if you'll pardon the expression. And Kevin
meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his
own. Oh, the anguish! Oh, the humanity! Oh, the writing!
Andrew W. Marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon
implausibility, from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his
handling of Jericho Cane, Schwarzenegger's character. Cane starts the
film a la Mel Gibson in the first "Lethal Weapon," preparing to put a
gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his
wife and daughter. Twenty minutes later, he's racing through the
bowels of New York City, deciphering clues that Sherlock Holmes and
Kreskin would find baffling.
When Cane meets up with Christine York, he instantly switches to
Terminator father figure mode, with the young woman serving as
surrogate daughter. In case anyone misses the connection, the camera
comes in for a close up of Christine's music box, which just happens
to be identical to one owned by Cane's daughter. Subtle, Marlowe,
subtle.
Speaking of cameras, director Peter Hyams is just the man to take
Marlowe's script and make it even more self-important, murky and
annoying. Hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a Gwar video,
with Cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces,
punctuated with loads of big explosions. Eager to satisfy Arnold's
core audience, he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well. What
a guy.
Had the film delivered some decent scares, or even maintained a
consistently ominous tone, the bombastic clichés might have been
tolerable, but "End of Days" is simply a flaccid special effects
show. The cast is just as ineffective. In his early scenes, Gabriel
Byrne attempts to invest Beelzebub with some panache, but he all too
soon turns into just another standard issue monster. Kevin Pollak
comes and goes quickly, Robin Tunney comes off like a bargain basement
Winona Ryder and as for Arnold, well  he's a better actor than
Casper Van Dien. That should count for something.
Way back in the aftermath "The Exorcist" and "The Omen," supernatural
swill like "End of Days" might have passed muster as a B-movie. But
that was then and this is now. "The X-Files" and "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" deliver real scares on a weekly basis and, if we want to see
the Devil, all we have to do is flip on "The 700 Club" and take a
gander at Pat Robertson's grinning maw. After enduring "End of Days,"
all I can say is "Get thee behind me, Satan. And while you're at it,
get thee a better agent as well."

Classified as a romantic comedy, "High Fidelity" is really a valentine
to every underpaid twerp who has ever held court behind the counter in
an independent record store. I can attest to the film's authenticity,
because I was once a member of that elite corps of self-styled demigods.
>From the details of how the definitive Zombies boxed set was assembled
to the name, age and background of the new bagpipe player in the
Tannahill Weavers, we knew everything  and were more than happy to
share our wealth of knowledge.
We snickered at the buffoons at a nearby chain store who filed CDs from
the legendary band Pere Ubu in the International section (they thought
Pere Ubu was a South American country!), shook our heads sadly when
customers looked for Monty Python albums in the "P's" and taught new
reggae fans about the brightness of ska and the dreamy wonders of dub.
And, yes, when you bought the latest from Phil Collins, we made fun of
you after you left the store.
John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, owner of Championship Vinyl, a funky
little record store in Chicago (the Nick Hornby novel that inspired the
film is set in London, but the transatlantic move doesn't hurt). While
the story revolves around Rob's godawful love life, the best parts take
place in the store, where he talks minutia with his two employees: Dick
(Todd Louiso), a pale passive-aggressive type and Barry (Jack Black), an
overtly aggressive elitist.
Together, the boys pass the hours making compilation tapes, dissecting
new music, quarreling like puppies in a cardboard box and makings lists.
Lists of the all-time top five death songs, the all-time top five
breakup songs and so on. In fact, the film is built around Rob's
compilation of his all-time top five most memorable split-ups.
That Rob has been a loser in love is no surprise. While he can be
charming on occasion, the perpetual adolescent is generally a real jerk.
Aimless, self-absorbed and lacking in the social graces, Rob is the kind
of guy who shouts "Charley, you fucking bitch, let's work it out!" at a
departing girlfriend and actually expects her to turn around and come
back.
Rob shares his pain by talking to the camera, an overdone gimmick that
drives me crazy, but John Cusack pulls it off better than most. Through
his narration and numerous flashbacks, we meet some of the women who
dumped him, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor (both of whom
make the best of their limited roles).
But the prime target of Rob's ramblings is Laura (Iben Hjejle), the
woman dumping him right now. Rob's misery grows when Laura takes up with
Ian (Tim Robbins), a smarmy, ponytailed fellow whose condescending tone
and mannered calm drives Rob right up the wall. Robbins drove me up the
wall as well. His is the one performance in the film that doesn't fit.
He overplays the role just enough that it feels like the actor is
actually more smug than his character.
Thank goodness for the extraordinary Jack Black, whom you might remember
as Lukas Haas' gung-ho marine brother in "Mars Attacks!" Black is a
terrific actor bound for greatness, a razor-sharp bulldog sliding from
lovable to naughty to ferocious in a single line. He projects the
intelligence and bite of vintage John Belushi, but without the aura of
self-destruction. John Cusack may be the name above the title, but Jack
Black is the real star of this show.
A number of other talented performers pop up for supporting roles and
cameo appearances. Lisa Bonet contributes a nice turn as a slurry
musician and Natasha Gregson Wagner is fine as an extremely inquisitive
journalist. Sara Gilbert, so wonderful as Darlene on "Roseanne," appears
all too briefly, as does John's sister, the delightful Joan Cusack. And,
in a very short daydream sequence, Bruce Springsteen makes his debut as
an actor, offering advice to Rob.
Director Stephen Frears ("The Grifters") juggles the flashbacks and
fantasies so adroitly that it takes awhile to notice the flimsiness of
the story. Luckily, "High Fidelity" is more about atmosphere, attitude
and snappy conversations than plot and, with a few exceptions, Frears
gets it right. The notion of returning to my record store days is
horrifying, but how nice it was to visit the boys for 113 minutes. Come
to think of it, if Jack Black was my co-worker, I might sign up for a
shift or two on weekends.

After watching Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" and sorting through 
your own reactions, I suggest you hop online and check out those of 
various critics. After all, part of the pleasure of a Kubrick film comes 
from comparing notes with others, because his work is open to so many 
different interpretations.  
Count on "Eyes Wide Shut" to provide an abundance of divergent opinions. 
The film concludes with a blunt, single-word statement from Nicole 
Kidman's character. One critic called the finale "guardedly hopeful," 
suggesting that "Kubrick believed in some sort of human progress after 
all." Another writer, after "carefully considering the wording of the 
character's final statement and the context in which it was made," states 
that "in the end, depersonalization wins out." 
Meanwhile, a third critic, who considers this Kubrick's most humane film, 
found the final shots moving and commented on the film's "unexpected last 
line," referring to it as advice that is "at once practical, eloquent and 
obscene." 
All of this in response to one carefully placed word. What fun! To the 
very end, Stanley Kubrick remained the consummate provocateur, as well as 
an unparalleled master in all aspects of filmmaking.
Deliberate and haunting, the two hour, 39 minute production is a grandly-
crafted dreamscape, simultaneously intimate and detached. Kubrick puts 
his lead characters in overwhelming settings, where piquant observations 
are nearly engulfed by the swirl of light, color and sound. The fallout 
comes later, during painful exchanges between husband and wife.
Inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella "Traumnovelle," "Eyes Wide 
Shut" follows Alice (Nicole Kidman) and Dr. Bill (Tom Cruise) Harford, an 
affluent New York couple, to a Christmas party at the opulent home of one 
of Bill's friends, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). Separated for most of 
the evening, Bill visits with an old medical school buddy, tends to a 
female guest who has overdosed on drugs and deals with two flirtatious 
models, while Alice becomes giddy on champagne, fending off the smarmy 
advances of an aging European gent who fancies himself a playboy.
While sharing a joint at home the next night, a discussion of fidelity 
turns traumatic when Alice, annoyed by some over-assured, vaguely 
condescending remarks from her husband, explains that she once strongly 
considered cheating on him with an attractive stranger. I was mesmerized 
by Alice's bedroom monologue and Bill's reaction to her words. Here is a 
man who views his marriage like a Faberge egg, a meticulous construct 
with every aspect of the relationship affixed in just the right place to 
maximize its elegance. When Alice rebels, her slurry confession/verbal 
assault shatters his treasured illusion. 
Faced with the prospect of a living marriage that demands active 
participation rather than routine maintenance, Bill panics. He leaves to 
visit a patient, but instead of returning home, prowls the darkened city 
streets, repeatedly envisioning a lurid affair he knows never happened. 
His compulsive exploration takes him into the furthest reaches of New 
York's sexual underground, which turns out to be far more dangerous, both 
spiritually and physically, than he could possibly have anticipated.    
Throughout the film, Kubrick uses a thrust and retreat approach that 
underscores Bill's wary dance with true intimacy. Again and again, 
characters almost connect, only to pull back at the last moment. The 
effect is frustrating and illuminating. 
Kubrick has more tricks up his sleeve. From the opening shot, an image of 
Alice's nude form that cuts to black like the blinking of an eye, he 
deals with audience preconceptions as adroitly as Alice does with Bill's. 
We get the much-anticipated orgy scene, but it is an detached spectacle 
that is more chilling than erotic. The participants begin with the ritual 
exchange of kisses, but the figures wear masks and their lips never touch.
 When the sex finally starts, the motions are formal, almost mechanical 
(and in the U.S. theatrical version, censored by digital figures inserted 
to insure an R-rating from the prudes at the MPAA). Anyone expecting a 
high-brow porn movie is in for a big disappointment.
As with most Kubrick films, the imagery is sumptuous and arresting. At 
the Christmas party, he uses a grainy film stock that accents the rich 
gold and white motif. Actors are strikingly framed and lighted, with 
splashes of color alternately highlighting and contrasting the mood of 
each scene. The New York street sets are detailed, but under-populated, 
adding to the ghostly feel. Jocelyn Pook's score is equally effective, 
with pronounced piano notes heightening the tension.
But the most resonant moments are the stark exchanges between Kidman and 
Cruise. Although Kidman has less screen time than her husband, she 
dominates the proceedings with a revelatory performance that is 
spontaneous, fragile, authoritative and altogether riveting. But don't 
overlook Cruise, who displays his trademark intensity while giving his 
character welcome shadings.
After only one viewing, I haven't come close to processing "Eyes Wide 
Shut" enough to make any sweeping pronouncements on the film. Stanley 
Kubrick movies require multiple viewings and I look forward to seeing 
this seductive, challenging psychological drama again, to further study 
the final work from one of the greats. 

Title
Review for Ice Storm, The (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Ice storms are magnificent and dangerous. The outdoor world becomes a 
gallery of ominous wonders, filled with crystalline sculptures that 
glisten in the winter light. Of course, the ice creates great hazards 
along with the beauty. Tree limbs and power lines grow heavy and snap 
under the extra weight, while surface areas become slick and treacherous. 
Although ice storms are alluring, most people choose to stay inside. 
Those who elect to venture out do so with great caution. 
But not the characters in "The Ice Storm." Adults hop in their cars to go 
for a drive on the slippery roads, while children venture forth to 
explore. One boy actually maneuvers his way onto a frozen diving board, 
where he proceeds to bounce up and down over the concrete surface of an 
empty swimming pool. Why? Why does a group of apparently intelligent 
people repeatedly engage in self-destructive behavior? 
"The Ice Storm" succeeds because director Ang Lee doesn't tell us why. 
Set in an affluent suburb of New Canaan, Connecticut in 1973, against the 
backdrop of Watergate and the remnants of the 60s cultural revolution, 
the angst-filled characters play out their lives without explanation. To 
paraphrase Lisa Simpson, they are enigmas, wrapped in riddles, wearing 
polyester. 
Lee, director of "Sense and Sensibility" and the wonderful "Eat Drink Man 
Woman," uses the tacky fashions of the early 70s to establish the era, 
but generally avoids playing the garish trappings for comedy. His stance 
is that of an observer, maintaining almost as much emotional distance as 
his characters keep between each another. He uses a beautifully staged 
ice storm as a metaphor, but leaves it to the viewer to determine exactly 
what aspect of human behavior the metaphor is addressing. The result is 
disquieting and compelling; images of these foolish people linger long 
after the movie is over.
The story, based on Rick Moody's 1994 novel, focuses on the Carvers and 
the Hoods, upscale New Canaan families who frequently travel the wooded 
path between their houses. Benjamin Hood (Kevin Kline) is the bed-mate of 
Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) in a loveless affair. Meanwhile, his wife 
Elena (Joan Allen) trudges through her duties, brimming with hostility 
but playing the role of silent martyr. Jim, Janey's husband, is a 
preoccupied type who makes little impact on his family. When he returns 
from one of his frequent business trips and cheerfully tells his boys 
"I'm back," one of them replies "You were gone?"
As the tension builds between the adults, their children keep busy aping 
their parent's behavior. When not glued to her television watching the 
Watergate proceedings or tossing caustic remarks at her father, Wendy 
Hood (Christina Ricci) pursues her sexual curiosity with both of the 
Carver boys; moody, analytical Mike (Elijah Wood) and his little brother 
Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd,) a painfully shy kid who spends his spare moments 
blowing up his toys. Wendy's brother Paul (Tobey Maguire) comes home from 
prep school for Thanksgiving, but his focus is back at school, where he 
vies with his roommate for the attention of a beautiful young woman. 
With the Carvers and the Hoods, it all keeps coming back to sex. The New 
Canaan suburbanites have read about the Sexual Revolution and are 
determined to keep up with fashion. Everything builds to a pivotal scene 
involving a Key Party, where the men drop their car keys in a bowl. At 
the end of the evening, the wives are to fish keys from the bowl and go 
home with whoever owns them. The camera captures all of the awkwardness 
of the hapless partygoers, downing large amounts of liquor and bantering 
nervously as they strain to be on the cutting edge of sexual behavior.
Lee is adept at creating a vivid sense of place, using numerous 
establishing and tracking shots to make the wistful, forlorn atmosphere 
of New Canaan come alive. When Elena looks up from a sidewalk book sale 
and sees her daughter riding her bike down the street, you can almost 
feel the crispness of the autumn air. Watching her daughter, Elena envies 
Wendy's freedom and playfulness, unaware that the young girl isn't 
feeling anything of the kind.
That sort of emotional misunderstanding is common in "The Ice Storm." The 
uniformly strong cast conveys the discomfort the characters feel with 
themselves and each other. Trapped in some perceived code of behavior, 
these people desperately want to relate to each other openly and honestly,
 but don't have a clue how to do it, so they make impulsive, foolish 
gestures. They know the danger inherent in an ice storm, but can't resist 
the beauty, so they venture out onto the slick surfaces anyway. And they 
fall.

"The Deep End" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a 
vast array of blues. Alluring, attractive blues, but also icy and 
foreboding. After taking in their beauty, the eye seeks out the 
reassuring browns and greens, like a tired swimmer searching for the 
safety of land. The production works that way as well  it pulls you in 
initially as a crisp, thoroughly-modern thriller, with clipped exchanges 
between defiantly non-communicative characters. But the real draw of the 
film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "The Deep End" 
gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy 
coating. 
SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals the basic storyline. I believe the 
plot points are incidental, because the real rewards come in exploring 
the mindset of the main characters, but still, you should proceed at 
your own risk. 
With her husband Tom, a Naval officer, often away at sea, Margaret Hall 
(Tilda Swinton) holds down the fort, taking care of the children, Beau 
(Jonathan Tucker), Paige (Tamara Hope), and Dylan (Jordon Dorrance), 
while her father-in-law Jack (Peter Donat) hovers in the background, 
always watching. The story opens with Margaret leaving the family home 
in Lake Tahoe to storm a male strip club in Reno. It seems that Beau, 
her eldest, is having an affair with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), a 
disreputable sort 12 years his senior. Margaret demands that Darby leave 
her son alone, only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be 
glad to steer clear of Beau  for $5000. 
Back at home, she tries to talk about it all with her son, but the kid 
won't even confirm that he's gay, let alone discuss the issues she has 
with his boyfriend. He does, however, get attentive when she reveals 
Darby's $5,000 offer, even as he maintains his sullen demeanor. Late in 
the evening, Darby shows up outside, tossing pebbles at Beau's window 
like a schoolchild. The two meet by the water at the boathouse, where 
something important happens. I won't reveal what; suffice to say we 
become aware of a significant fact that Margaret does not. 
All of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie, by the way. 
Within a day or so, Margaret's life becomes even more complicated when a 
suave man named Alec Goran Visnjic) turns up with an explicit videotape 
documenting the sex life of Beau and Darby. He and his associate are 
willing to destroy the tape, once Margaret coughs up $50,000. 
Written, directed and produced by Scott McGehee and David Siegel 
("Suture"), "The Deep End" is based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's 1940's 
novel, "The Blank Wall," which was also the source of the 1949 film, 
"The Reckless Moment." I've neither read the book nor seen the movie, 
but I understand that the filmmakers changed some details. In Holding's 
story, the "scandalous" relationship is between an older man and 
Margaret's teen-age daughter. Switching the gender makes the tale seem 
more contemporary, and it also raises questions about Margaret's 
motives. 
Many reviews of "The Deep End" describe Margaret as a mother ferociously 
protecting her son, but I wonder. Consider this: Margaret lives in a 
meticulously kept upscale home. Her husband is absent most of the time 
and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure. Her father-in-law 
is constantly present, almost as if he is monitoring for his son. And 
when her husband does call, Margaret is careful not to tell him about 
anything disturbing that is going on with the family. 
So is Margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is 
simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take 
advantage of him? Or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class 
complacency, desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything 
will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea? You sort 
it out. 
Regardless, the resonance of "The Deep End" comes from two actors. Goran 
Visnjic, best known from the TV drama "ER," is striking as a blackmailer 
unlike any you've seen before. He engages Margaret in a mesmerizing 
dance of protocol, chivalry and simmering eroticism. But the star of 
this show, without a doubt, is the remarkable Tilda Swinton. Watch the 
shadings, depth, resource, vitality and understated sexuality she gives 
Margaret and try to imagine the film without her. Days after my second 
viewing of "The Deep End," I can still vividly picture her negotiating 
with villains, trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue 
water. "The Deep End" is an exceptional film and Tilda Swinton is the 
best part of it.

Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
The Fifth Element (1997)
Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Milla Javovich, Chris Tucker, Luke 
Perry, Brion James, Tommy "Tiny" Lister, Lee Evans, John Neville. 
Directed by Luc Besson. 127 minutes.
PG-13,  3.5 stars (out of 5 stars)
Here's the bottom line. If you love sci-fi thrill rides, go see "The 
Fifth Element" right now. Don't read the rest of this review until after 
you've seen the film and don't let your friends tell you about the movie. 
Just go and enjoy the most spectacular piece of mindless eye candy to 
come along in years. 
I really should stop right there, but if I did there would be a big blank 
spot on this page and I wouldn't get paid, so I suppose I should proceed. 
When I was little, I watched "The Jetsons" a lot. The writing was awful, 
bad enough to make "The Flintstones" look good by comparison, but that 
didn't matter. I just loved watching those anti gravity cars whizzing 
through the air past futuristic buildings. As an adult, I trotted off to 
every sci-fi film that came to town, yearning to see a realistic 
depiction of the kind of world in which the Jetsons lived. There was 
"Logan's Run,"  with its horribly fake looking models of a futuristic 
domed city. Then came "Star Wars," which did show a futuristic town, but 
the hover-cars were cheesy and the buildings looked like pueblos. The 
"Star Trek" films gave us glimpses of San Francisco in the future, but it 
was always the same shot; a panorama including the Golden Gate bridge and 
a couple of flying cars. The shot was tantalizing, but just didn't cut 
the mustard. Then "Blade Runner" hit, with its beautifully realized 
vision of a futuristic decadent Los Angeles. The massive motion picture 
billboards, flying cars, and post-punk city streets were dazzling, but it 
still didn't satisfy my adolescent Jetsons fantasies. After "Blade Runner,
" most sci-fi flicks tried to copy the same look, or simply avoided city 
scenes altogether.
"The Fifth Element" is my Jetsons wet dream come true. We get a long, 
breath-taking look at New York in the 23rd century, with loads of 
knockout shots of flying cars in intricate traffic patterns whizzing past 
massive futuristic buildings. I drank in every moment and wished there 
was some way I could move there.
What's really great is that those stunning cityscapes are just a tiny 
part of the film. From beginning to end, "The Fifth Element" fills the 
screen with one incredibly imaginative scene after another, all presented 
with high style, lots of action and a great sense of humor. Starting in 
1914 Egypt and quickly moving to the mid 23rd century, director Luc 
Besson ("The Big Blue") gives the audience a visual feast at breakneck 
pace. "The Fifth Element" is flat-out the coolest sci-fi flick since 
"Star Wars."
You may have noticed the rather juvenile tone this piece has taken. It is 
quite deliberate. Sci-fi springs from that 15 year old kid that lives in 
all of us. Great sci-fi requires an epic (and usually pretty silly) story 
involving the fate of worlds; with cool aliens, tons of killer special 
effects and a villain whose name starts with the letter Z. "The Fifth 
Element" delivers on all counts, and throws in some good acting as well.
Bruce Willis plays our hero, a cabby with a colorful past. A couple of 
years ago, some other movie critic came up with the Bruce Willis Rule, 
which is very simple. The shorter Willis' hair, the better his acting. 
That rule has held true until now. Willis has a pretty good head of hair 
this time around, yet delivers a straightforward, quite charismatic 
performance. He even knocks off lines like "I only speak two languages; 
English and bad English" without hamming it up. Gary Oldman plays the 
evil Zorg in freaky clothes and hair, while giving his character's 
presence a nice twist. When he makes his first sinister appearance, you 
expect a deep, ominous English accent. Instead, Oldman delivers his lines 
in a halting Arkansas drawl. The effect is disconcerting and very 
effective. The radiant Milla Javovich casts an otherworldly spell as 
Leeloo; the key character in the epic master plan. 
"The Fifth Element" breaks up the action with some broad comedy, ranging 
from a stocky Police matron in a Princess Leia cinnamon bun hairdo, to a 
interplanetary deejay whose presentation style is more flamboyant than 
Little Richard. The film contains loads of other treats, but you don't 
want to read about them here. Just forget about being an adult and let 
that raging 15 year old inside you loose. Haul ass to a theater with a 
great sound system and have a field day with this epic, goofy beaut of a 
movie. I'm going back as soon as possible, and I swear that I will never 
watch those damn Jetsons again.

To best enjoy "The Truman Show," there's a couple of things you need to 
do. First, disregard the hype. Ads for the film use a quote from Esquire 
calling it "The Movie Of The Decade." That sort of hyperbole does nothing 
but raise audience expectations to such an unrealistic level that 
disappointment is inevitable. Second, try to put aside any preconceptions 
you have about Jim Carrey. If you loved his rubber-faced antics in films 
like "Ace Ventura," you need to understand that he doesn't do that here. 
Conversely, those who dismiss Carrey as a juvenile embarrassment, the 
Jerry Lewis of the apocalypse, should realize that there's more to the 
man than his geeky persona suggests. This is Carrey's breakthrough movie, 
where he finally takes the lampshade off his head and proves that he can 
act. 
Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the first child legally adopted by a 
corporation. From the moment of his birth, Truman has been the unknowing 
star of the most popular TV series in history, a 24 hour a day epic about 
him. Truman lives in Seahaven, an idyllic small town which is actually a 
gigantic set inside a huge domed studio. The beautiful blue skies and 
gorgeous sunsets are all special effects, and the entire population of 
Seahaven are actors, except for Truman Burbank. Raised in this idealized, 
artificial world, Truman shares a home with a fake wife, spends his days 
at a fake job, and confides his hopes and fears to his fake best friend, 
unaware that 5,000 cameras are monitoring his every move. Unaware, that 
is, until one day when the blue sky rips and a stage light plummets from 
above and crashes on the street near him. Minutes later, while driving to 
work, he hears a newscast offering a contrived explanation for the 
occurrence. Truman changes channels, only to pick up a radio signal 
broadcasting stage instructions to the Seahaven crew. Realizing that 
something very strange is going on, Truman begins to examine his world, 
and the game is afoot.
Director Peter Weir ("Gallipoli," "The Year of Living Dangerously" 
"Witness") has created a whale of a good movie, a rich, entertaining, 
thoughtful work that is at once lyrical and ominous. Wisely, he lets the 
audience in on the premise from the beginning, through a faux documentary 
about the phenomenal success of "The Truman Show," including footage of 
giddy fans hooked on the program. We meet the show's creator, a quietly 
intimidating "visionary" named Christof, played by the wonderful Ed 
Harris, who gives a masterful, Oscar-worthy performance as the brooding 
artist. Christof, who fancies himself as Truman's ersatz father figure, 
defends the purity and integrity of his creation, even when challenged 
during a call-in program by a young woman who lost her job as an extra in 
the show when she made direct contact with Truman and tried to tell him 
the truth about his "reality." In addition to providing entertainment for 
millions, Christof patiently explains, he's actually doing Truman a 
service by giving him a world much more desirable than the real one.
Indeed, Peter Weir made some interesting choices in creating Truman's un-
real world. He crafts a highly stylized environment in Seahaven, a 
disquieting cross between the Village from the classic TV series "The 
Prisoner" and Mayfield, the Cleaver's hometown in "Leave It To Beaver." 
Squeaky clean and homogenized, Seahaven feels like the setting for an old 
sit-com, and the actors amplify the mood, smiling too broadly as they 
exchange banalities and awkwardly insert product placements into Truman's 
life. In the center of the surrealism, Carrey initially plays his role 
much like the Darren Stevens character from the old "Bewitched" series. 
His expressions and gestures are almost cartoonish, understandable when 
you look at the context in which Truman was raised. As Truman gradually 
becomes aware that his life is a facade, Carrey's acting turns more and 
more realistic, intensifying the nightmarish journey of a man trying to 
escape from a Stepford world.
Beyond its immense value as pure entertainment, "The Truman Show" is a 
subversive piece of work, genially assaulting the jaded, voyeuristic 
culture of the 90's. Weir offers a society where the most popular show in 
existence is an endless peepshow focused on the utterly mundane life of 
an insurance agent. He suggests our world has become so ugly that 
millions would take comfort in imagined intimacy with a familiar 
character in pleasant surroundings, even if their hero is a virtual 
prisoner and the utopia is phony and bland. It would be easy to dismiss 
the film as just a well-done paranoid fantasy, were it not for the 
enduring popularity of "The Real World," "Cops" and "The Jerry Springer 
Show." The sad truth is that "The Truman Show" is already running and 
we're watching it every day.

Combining beautiful people in glorious, exotic locales with a lurid
tale of duplicity and murder, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is the big
screen equivalent of the thick paperback thrillers so popular with
vacationers. Like most of those novels, the film is also a bit
overstuffed, but that's easy to forgive. With this well-acted,
wonderfully textured work, director Anthony Minghella ("The English
Patient") has crafted a wicked psychological study that would do
Hitchcock proud.
Based on the 1955 novel by Patricia Highsmith, the film centers on
Thomas Ripley (Matt Damon), an ambitious, facile young man who envies
the lush lifestyle of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), an American
expatriate lolling around Italy with his girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow), so much that he decides to take over his identity by any
means necessary.
Tom Ripley's fractured journey begins in New York City, when
industrialist Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) mistakes the
impoverished young piano player for a classmate of his wayward son. He
offers to fund Tom on a trip to convince Dickie to return home.
Ripley soon finds himself in a wonderland of beaches, villas, trendy
clubs and an air of privilege. In short order, he ingratiates himself
with the handsome, charismatic Dickie, furthering the bonding process
by revealing his "mission" to the urbane layabout. Now operating as a
"double agent," Tom writes encouraging letters to the senior
Greenleaf, while spending the father's money knocking about the
country with his son.
All is well until the relationship begins to fray. Dickie tends to aim
his full attention toward the latest arrival to his social circle,
giving scant time to those who have been around longer. Ripley soon
finds that he is no longer the flavor of the day. Rather than an
intriguing newcomer, he is now perceived as a hanger-on. As if this
isn't bad enough, Dickie reacts negatively to Tom's quasi-erotic
advances. While on an out-of-town holiday with Dickie, the calculating
young Ripley strikes out. His plan is to lay low in various Italian
cities, using forged letters and his skills as a mimic to co-opt
Dickie's identity. The scheme is clearly a house of cards, but then
again, Tom Ripley is a very resourceful man.
In Patricia Highsmith's novel (the first of a series of books on the
character), Ripley is a flat-out sociopath. A large part of the
story's twisted pleasure comes from seeing life through the eyes of
this coldly efficient shark. Minghella changes the tone by giving Tom
a bit of a conscience. He also plays up Ripley's sexuality. While it
was established in the book that Tom was at least bisexual, if not
entirely gay, his sexual orientation was almost irrelevant. People
were just a means to an end and their gender meant little to this
self-absorbed acquisition machine. While I understand why Minghella
felt the need to make the changes, I still prefer Ripley in his
undiluted asexual mode.
But thanks to the immense skills of Matt Damon, the altered Ripley
still works. To emphasize the class differences between Tom and
Dickie, Minghella wanted Damon to initially appear pale and
scrawny. Accordingly, Damon dropped 30+ pounds and stayed in the
shadows. His efforts were successful. When Tom first meets Dickie and
Marge, turning up on the beach in an ill-fitting Speedo, he looks
underfed, out of place and remarkably exposed. Anyone who dismissed
Matt Damon as just another Hollywood pretty boy will learn better here
- Damon is the genuine article; an accomplished actor who will do
whatever it takes to make his character credible. He is extraordinary,
deftly playing his wholesome good looks against an ever-darkening
persona in one of the year's best performances.
Jude Law is his match as the magnetic Dickie Greenleaf. He totally
captures the spirit of the character; a tempestuous, supremely
confident dilettante who perceives himself as the real thing. It's
easy to understand why Marge and Tom would be drawn to this smoldering
young firebrand. While Gwyneth Paltrow has far less to do, she acquits
herself nicely as Marge, who is far more assertive here than in the
book.
Anthony Minghella does a masterful job with his exceptional cast and
stunning Italian locations, creating an alluring sense of bohemian
abandon. After watching the film, I was ready to hop the next plane to
Italy and hang out with these people, even if it meant maneuvering
around the dangerous Mr. Ripley. Minghella uses the radiant settings
to maximum effect - the darkest moment of the story takes place in
bright sunlight, which makes its impact even stronger.
While the mechanics of the film's last act play better in the book
than onscreen, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" still packs a considerable
punch. At two hours and 20 minutes, the film is a bit longer than it
needs to be, but Anthony Minghella's sprawling creation remains one of
the most captivating, and chilling, character studies to come along in
quite a while. So skillful and seductive is the portrayal of Tom
Ripley that you find yourself hoping he'll get away with his
crimes. Now that's truly disturbing.

Review for In the Company of Men (1997)

His philosophy. "Never lose control - - that is the total key to the 
universe". His outlook on women. "I don't trust anything that bleeds for 
a week and doesn't die". His idea. "Let's hurt somebody". 
Meet Chad, an attractive, glib young man who manipulates others with 
surgical efficiency. His name couldn't be more appropriate, conjuring up 
images of All-American good looks and slick superficiality. A wolf in 
preppie's clothing, Chad has charisma and knows exactly how to best 
utilize it to further his ruthless agenda. And if he destroys some people 
along the way, well...good!
"In The Company Of Men", the debut feature by Fort Wayne writer-director 
Neil LaBute, is a stark, nasty little tale of competition, power and 
cruelty. Corporate climbers Chad and Howard are sent to a small 
Midwestern town for a six-week assignment. Both men are filled with anger,
at their company for farming them out and promoting younger men ahead of 
them, and at women, for dumping them. Smiling at his toady colleague, 
Chad lays out a plan to ease their pain. During the six-week stay, the 
men will find a suitable victim, carefully build dual romantic 
relationships with her, then break her heart just before skipping town. 
"Trust me", Chad purrs, "she'll be reaching for the sleeping pills within 
a week, and we will laugh about this until we are very old men". 
Initially startled by the coldness of the plan, Howard agrees to 
participate. The men select a deaf receptionist as their prey, and the 
game is afoot.
LaBute's ultra low-budget feature, filmed for less than $25,000, created 
a sensation across the country. Despite winning an award at the Sundance 
Festival, it was one of the last films to find a distributor, thanks to 
executives skittish over the staggering misogyny of the lead characters. 
Sony Pictures Classic finally picked up the film, which has garnered some 
of the best reviews of the year.
"In The Company Of Men" is shocking, but the central conceit is nothing 
new. During the 60's, many of the frothy Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedies 
were built around the idea of men deceiving women to meet their own ends. 
One of the subplots of last years "Everybody Says I Love You" focused on 
Woody Allen building a romance with Julia Roberts based totally on deceit.
 What makes "In The Company Of Men" different isn't the premise. It's not 
even the brazenness of the plan. "In The Company Of Men" shocks because 
of the sustained cruelty of Chad and his utter lack of remorse. As Chad, 
29 year-old Aaron Eckhart is mesmerizing, a reptile with a broad smile 
and GQ good looks. He is one of the best villains in recent memory, the 
epitome of the corporate world's dark underbelly. He amuses his cohorts 
by thumbing through a company magazine and pronouncing his hatred for the 
various executives therein. He casually humiliates a young intern, 
bullying the man into pulling down his pants ("You got the balls for this?
Well, show me those clankers") then smirking and sending him off to 
fetch some coffee. But he reserves his worst for Christine, the deaf 
receptionist, wooing her with new-age sensitive-guy shtick, while mocking 
her disabilities behind her back.
While Chad is the bold Nazi, Howard functions as the "good German 
soldier", cooperating with the plan even as he develops real affection 
for Christine. As the mealy-mouthed Howard, Matt Malloy paints a 
disturbing portrait of what a person can turn into when he lacks focus 
and courage of heart. Howard appears a bit sympathetic initially, but 
ultimately his uncertain stumbling approach does as much damage as Chad. 
Stacy Edwards is exceptional as Christine, investing the character with 
enough strength to keep her from appearing to be a mere victim, and 
enough nuance to keep her from looking like a saint. Edwards, who is not-
deaf, manages to capture the unique vocal inflection of a deaf person 
without overdoing it.
Neil LaBute is a playwright and "In The Company Of Men" is very a stagy 
piece of work. LaBute uses the camera in a static fashion that invites 
the audience to examine the characters as if they were animals in a zoo. 
The result is effective, though one questions whether it was deliberate 
or simply the mark of a first-time director.
While "In The Company Of Men" deals with misogyny, the real focus of the 
film is the competition between Chad and Howard for power, personal and 
corporate. The story is extreme, but the message is clear. If never 
losing control becomes your mantra, the only thing you'll end up in touch 
with is your own inner Chad.
Rating: Four stars.

Based on advertisements alone, it would be easy to mistake "One True 
Thing" for just another tearjerker, but the film is actually much more 
than that. Written and acted with a remarkable sense of detail, this rich 
drama investigates one of life's most baffling mysteries: how our 
parent's marriages work.   
I'm not being glib here. At one time or another, we've all studied our 
parents and thought, "Who ARE these people? How can they live like this? 
How can they stand each other?" Early in life, we pass judgment on them 
as individuals and as a couple. Days turn to years, years turn to decades,
 but we rarely bother to review those evaluations to determine if they 
were actually valid. 
In the 1995 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel on which the film is based, 
author Anna Quindlen states, "Our parents are never real people to us. 
They are... Achilles' heels, dim nightmares, vocal tics, bad noses, hot 
tears, all handed down and us stuck with them." "One True Thing" shows 
what happens when circumstances force an adult child to deal with her 
mother and father on a level different from that with which she is 
accustomed.
Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger) is an ambitious investigative reporter 
whose career defines her life. When a family emergency strikes, she cedes 
to her father's demands and returns home from New York to care for her 
ailing mother. Struggling in vain to balance journalism by long distance 
with her newfound household duties, she finds her carefully crafted life 
dissolving, and all of her childhood resentments returning to the surface.
The Gulden family dynamics will seem familiar to many. Patriarch George 
(William Hurt) is a respected literary professor and celebrated author. 
Always ready with a studied quip or well-worn anecdote, George takes his 
role as leader and perpetual center of attention as a given. Even as 
adults, Ellen and her brother Brian (Tom Everett Scott) find themselves 
concealing their failings from Dad, still striving to gain approval from 
the lord of the manor.
The consummate homemaker, wife and mother Kate (Meryl Streep) appears to 
live only to serve. In Ellen's eyes, she seems almost trivial, an 
appendage to her husband rather than a self-realized individual. When 
Kate falls ill and George badgers his daughter into taking a sabbatical 
to help her mother, Ellen lands in a personal hell as she haplessly 
attempts to play the role of housewife. 
This is the stuff of countless sappy TV movies, but "One True Thing" has 
the substance and integrity most dramas about family lack. The handsome 
production is reminiscent of "Ordinary People" in its rich, stirring 
depiction of the realities beneath the surface of an upper-class family. 
Karen Croner's screenplay, based on Quindlen's bestseller, is precise and 
extremely insightful, taking stereotypical characters and turning them 
into real people. Having an all-star cast doesn't hurt, either. 
Tom Everett Scott is effective in a supporting role as the easygoing son 
who takes after his mother while deferring to his dad. William Hurt gives 
one of his best performances in years, with his prickly, cerebral persona 
perfectly suited to this role. George is much like Mary Tyler Moore's 
character in "Ordinary People"; he loves his family, but is self-absorbed 
and lacks crucial nurturing skills. "One True Thing" refuses to write off 
George as a villain, though, instead exploring the self-doubt and fear 
beneath this damaged man's exterior.
As Kate, Meryl Streep is simply extraordinary, investing the character 
with remarkable depth and humanity, without ever seeming pious or 
mannered. Kate's essence is best explained when she refers to her 
husband's literary mantra, "Less is more," and tells her daughter, "I 
disagree with your father. More is more." Streep is especially good in 
scenes depicting the latter stages of Kate's illness, effectively 
conveying the difficulties in trying to retain her composure while pain 
and fatigue batter her soul.
Renee Zellweger has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, 
representing all adults in the audience who have ever rolled their eyes 
in frustration over the conduct of their parents. As our surrogate, 
Zellweger nails our generation's behavior with often uncomfortable 
accuracy. She does her duty for the family, but makes sure those around 
her understand exactly how much of a sacrifice she is making. Her 
periodic whining and petulant manner are difficult to watch because she 
reflects us so very well.
Honest, perceptive and moving, "One True Thing" builds to a revelatory 
climax, forcing you to rethink everything you've seen up to that moment. 
You'll likely do considerable thinking after you've left the theater as 
well. "One True Thing" makes a simple, but powerful suggestion: maybe our 
long-held assessments of our parents are wrong. We grew up asking, and 
generally receiving, second chances from Mom and Dad. Perhaps it's time 
to return the favor.

"Playing by Heart" examines the relationships between 11 people, hopping 
back and forth between their lives until the end, when an event draws all 
of the characters to the same place at the same time. Writer/director 
Willard Carroll deserves points for ambition - - how many other artists 
making their second film would dare to try and synthesize Robert Altman 
and Neil Simon? Unfortunately, Carroll's reach far exceeds his grasp and, 
despite its first rate cast and some very well-crafted segments, "Playing 
by Heart" too often comes off like an ungainly, land-locked "Love Boat" 
episode with a glandular disorder.
Set in L.A., the sprawling production interweaves a half dozen storylines.
 An antisocial theater director (Gillian Anderson) is wary of an open-
hearted architect (Jon Stewart) who seems too good to be true. A brash, 
talkative club-hopper (Angelina Jolie) attempts to draw out a sullen 
cipher (Ryan Phillippe). An older couple (Gena Rowlands, Sean Connery) 
examines their lives together while trying to cope with past mistakes and 
the ravages of age. A man with a terribly sad expression (Dennis Quaid) 
travels from bar to bar, telling outrageous lies to a couple of women 
(Nastassja Kinski, Patricia Clarkson) and a drag queen (Alec Mapa) for no 
apparent reason. Two unhappy souls (Madeline Stowe, Anthony Edwards) 
carry on an affair in an anonymous hotel room. A mother (Ellen Burstyn) 
fusses over her son (Jay Mohr) as he lies in a hospital bed, enduring the 
final stages of AIDS.
That's a whole lot of story and Carroll doesn't manage it well. The film 
is choppy and, more often than not, matters feel merely bleak or mawkish 
rather than insightful. Stowe and Edwards' cheating hearts receive scant 
attention and, while Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr try very hard, their 
mother/son deathbed exchanges contain nothing we haven't seen in 
countless TV movies. 
As a couple who have been together long enough to weather any storm, Gena 
Rowlands and Sean Connery project a comforting air, despite being handed 
some of the film's worst dialogue. Connery, playing a gruff, but lovable 
Lou Grant type, fumbles badly when trying to present the character's 
playful side. One brief scene, showing the grand actor prancing about the 
house while imitating a puppy, is one of the more embarrassing images 
I've witnessed in a long time. 
Jon Stewart and Gillian Anderson fare much better in their tale of wary 
courtship. Anderson makes her naturally brittle nature work to her 
advantage, while Stewart thankfully keeps his character from becoming 
overly cute. Their sweet and sour relationship works nicely, due to the 
actors' deft handling of the material. Dennis Quaid is also compelling as 
the tortured liar. His vignettes with Nastassja Kinski, Patricia Clarkson 
and Alec Mapa are among the film's best.
But the real scene-stealers are Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe, a 
genuinely engaging odd couple. Jolie, who resembles Geena Davis in looks 
and spirit, has a wonderfully blithe quality. She consistently brightens 
the screen in a confident, star-making performance. And Phillippe, a very 
serious young actor whose intensity often works against him, hits just 
the right notes here, effectively balancing the borderline surliness of 
his character with a welcome sense of vulnerability. 
Willard Carroll should have picked one or two storylines and focused 
predominately on them. By trying to give equal time to so many melodramas,
 he leaps around excessively, diluting the impact of even the strongest 
plots. When the film finally reaches its grand finale, which ties things 
up a bit too neatly, the pay-off feels merely clever, rather than 
revelatory. After two hours of zigzagging stories and an overabundance of 
maudlin dialogue, just reaching the conclusion is a relief. Still, for 
all of its awkwardness and excess, "Playing by Heart" has enough good 
moments to excuse most of its failings. Except, of course, for Sean 
Connery's puppy impression.

Review for Cop Land (1997)
Cop Land (1997)

Rappaport, Janeane Garafalo

"Cop Land" is a film about weight. The weight of defeat, of broken dreams,
 of corruption, conscience and culpability. As Sheriff Freddy Heflin, 
Sylvester Stallone trudges through life. A heroic act as a young man cost 
him his hearing in one ear. The partial hearing loss cost him his dream 
of becoming a New York City Police officer.  And the loss of his dream 
cost him everything. So Freddy trudges through life, 40 pounds overweight,
 with a sad smile, a lazy gait and a don't make waves attitude. Heflin is 
Sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey, a small town just across the river from 
NYC. Garrison's population is comprised largely of New York cops who have 
made the town their refuge, an oasis from the madness of the big city. 
They treat Heflin with benign condescension, as nothing more than a slow-
witted figurehead. And Heflin accepts the role; if he can't be a "real" 
cop, at least he can hang out with them. 
So life goes on, with Heflin deferring to the lawbreaking and casual 
bullying of his "superiors", until an incident in NYC changes it all. 
Late one night, Murray Babitch (Michael Rappaport) is side-swiped on the 
George Washington bridge by a pair of joy-riders. When he pursues them, 
one of the men leans out the window and taunts Babitch while aiming 
something at him. Babitch panics and fires on them, resulting in a car 
wreck and two dead young men. Within minutes, the bridge is swarming with 
people, and the only object found near the men's bodies is "The Club". 
Police cronies plant a gun, but an alert paramedic notices the scam and 
raises loud objections. Amidst the chaos, Babitch's uncle, Senior officer 
Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) spirits his nephew away, claiming that the 
young cop committed suicide by jumping from the bridge.
Babitch is given a lavish police funeral, while Uncle Ray keeps the youth 
tucked away in his Garrison home, so convinced of the sanctity of the 
town that he holds a barbecue at the house, with the youth wandering 
about freely drinking and socializing. Sheriff Heflin knows about the 
brazen farce. Internal Affairs investigator Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) 
suspects. But the cops in Garrison have many powerful friends.
The investigation of the incident allows "Cop Land" to spin off into a 
wide variety of sub-plots and character studies. The film meanders, the 
multiple stories become confusing, and the inevitable show-down is overly 
simplistic and more than a bit illogical, but Cop Land works anyway, 
because of writer/director James Mangold's steady, assured pacing, 
excellent cinematography and the strong performances of the powerhouse 
cast. 
Stallone sheds his Nautilus image for the film, reminding us that he 
began his career as an actor, not an icon. His Sheriff Heflin is a 
fascinating character, an utterly defeated man with a spark of his former 
self still burning somewhere inside. Stallone's nuanced performance is 
good,  hopefully a harbinger of a new direction for his career. Keitel is 
excellent as the leader of the Garrison cops, a viper of a man whose 
smile is nearly as threatening as his scowl. De Niro does his usual fine 
work, as do Robert Patrick, Cathy Moriarty, Annabella Sciorra and Peter 
Berg in supporting roles. The wonderful Janeane Garofalo, who seems 
incapable of making a bad career move, has a nice turn in a cameo as one 
of Sheriff Heflin's deputies. 
The actor who makes the biggest splash in "Cop Land", however, is Ray 
Liotta. After a long series of simplistic bad guy roles, Liotta finally 
has a part with some meat to it, and he is outstanding. His Officer Gary 
Figgis was once a member of the Garrison cop's inner circle, but became 
estranged from the group following the murder of his partner, who had 
planned to testify against the officers. Figgis is a bloated mess of a 
man, a cokehead drowning in anger and self-pity, but his conscience has 
survived and he becomes an uneasy ally of Sheriff Heflin. 
Beyond the dynamic acting, "Cop Land" offers several impressive set 
pieces. One of the best involves a violent confrontation, viewed through 
Stallone's hearing-impaired character. The combination of near-silence 
and high-voltage action is disconcerting and mesmerizing, adding a 
surreal element to the film at just the right moment.
The structural and logical flaws of "Cop Land" are easy to forgive, given 
the strong acting, pacing and framing of the film. Writer/director 
Mangold has constructed a worthy tale of despair and redemption that 
overflows with memorable images. "Cop Land" isn't a great film, but it is 
a very good one.

When I first learned Jim Carrey would star in a film based on the life
of performance artist Andy Kaufman, a number of questions sprang to
mind. Would Carrey be able to pull off a credible impression of the
late performer? Would the film accurately capture Kaufman's peculiar
appeal? And, most importantly, was this movie really necessary?
The answers turn out to be yes, yes and no.
Andy Kaufman first reached a mass audience on the debut of "Saturday
Night Live," with a hilarious bit where he lip-synched one sentence
from the "Mighty Mouse" theme song. After a number of additional "SNL"
appearances, he reached stardom on "Taxi" as Latka Gravas, the lovable
immigrant mechanic whose halting English was supplemented by long
streams of Latka's deliciously odd native language.
Always the provocateur, Kaufman periodically turned up in another
persona, that of Tony Clifton; an extremely obnoxious lounge lizard
type. Kaufman also became obsessed with wrestling women, alienating a
large segment of his fans along the way. After "Taxi" completed its
run, his controversial behavior led to a call-in ballot on "SNL,"
where the audience voted by a large margin to ban the performer from
the show forever. Later, when it was announced that the 35-year-old
was dying of cancer, many wondered if this was yet another put-on.
In "Man on the Moon" (the title comes from the wonderful tribute song
by R.E.M.), Jim Carrey does a startlingly accurate impersonation of
Kaufman onstage. He really nails him; sounding, moving and even
looking like the off-the-wall entertainer. His Kaufman impression is
as good as Kaufman's legendary Elvis impression. But that's not enough
to justify a movie. I wanted to learn more about what made Andy tick,
or at least see some juicy behind-the-scenes material. Instead, "Man
on the Moon" is content to merely reenact oft-seen Kaufman
performances. Comedy Central frequently runs two thorough
documentaries on Andy Kaufman, and E!, MSNBC and A&E have all done
competent biographies on him. Why watch an impersonation when footage
of the actual man is so accessible?
They could have done more. Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's closest collaborator,
was intimately involved in the production of the film. Why didn't we
get the story of how the two got together, or some scenes of them
working as a team, plotting out the various stunts? Zmuda often played
the heavily made-up Tony Clifton in Kaufman's absence. How about a
little explanation on how the character was cooked up?
Continuing my rant, how about an explanation about the wrestling with
women business? In the film, people repeatedly ask Kaufman why he
persists in pursuing such a career-damaging bit, but answers are never
provided. In addition to Zmuda, Kaufman's manager and girlfriend were
also involved with the making of the movie. It's hard to believe that,
over the course of years, he never gave them any answers.
As good as Carrey is during the onstage segments, he seems lost when
the spotlights go off, geeking it up excessively during personal
moments. I've seen interviews with Kaufman and he didn't spend every
waking moment looking at people with bug-eyed expressions. I suspect
Carrey did the goon routine in the intimate scenes because he didn't
have anything else to work with.
I also suspect the filmmakers wanted it that way. I think they believed it would be clever to keep the film as cryptic as Kaufman's various personas. The hook of the movie is that he created so many characters that the real Andy Kaufman got lost along the way, but that feels like cheap pathos to me, and I expect more than that from a director of Milos Forman's caliber. After all, this is the man behind "Amadeus" and "The People vs. Larry Flynt." 
Forman starts the film off in style, with Kaufman addressing the
audience in his foreign man character, complaining about how his story
was handled and then running the closing credits while shooing us out
of the theater. But after this promising surreal beginning, the
production turns into a series of obvious vignettes depicting Andy's
greatest hits.
The low point comes late in the film, when a desperate Kaufman goes to
the Philippines in search of a cancer cure from "psychic surgeons,"
con men who claimed to be able to prod a person's stomach with their
hands and miraculously remove tumors without an incision. In the real
world, these scam artists fooled thousands of cancer patients before
their trick was finally exposed. But in the movie, Andy glances down
and immediately spots the deception. The camera then comes in for a
close-up of Kaufman smiling wryly; the prankster fooled by another
group of pranksters. How tragic. How ironic. What a crock.
I'm glad that "Man on the Moon" has sparked a revival of interest in
Andy Kaufman, but the bottom line is this. As much as I admired
Kaufman's impersonation of Elvis Presley, I would much rather watch a
documentary of the genuine article. And as much as I admire Jim
Carrey's impersonation of Andy Kaufman, I'll skip future viewings of
this superficial recreation and catch one of the numerous
documentaries featuring the real man on cable.

The most honest film I've seen about the Recovery Process is Al
Franken's much maligned "Stuart Saves His Family." The 1995 feature, a
spin-off from "Saturday Night Live," centers on Franken's Stuart Smalley
character, a maddening, but endearing little guy who belongs to several
12-step programs. Flinging around Recovery slogans ("denial isn't only a
river in Egypt," "that's just stinkin' thinkin'") like confetti at a
parade, Stuart struggles to break free from his obsessive-compulsive
behavior patterns, generally taking two steps forward and three steps
back.
"Stuart Saves His Family" was a critical and commercial flop, but videos
of the movie remain hot properties on the 12-step circuit, because
members appreciate the warts-and-all portrayal of a man determined to
become a better person.
Although the subject matter is similar, "28 Days" is the antithesis of
"Stuart Saves His Family." The film plays like an escapee from the
Lifetime Channel, boosted only by the talents of Sandra Bullock. This is
a star vehicle and, while there are scattered affecting moments, the
production is glib and overly pat, often using humor inappropriately.
Take the wedding scene, for example. After too much partying with her
boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), Gwen Cummings (Bullock) shows up late
to perform bridesmaid duties for her sister, Lily (Elizabeth Perkins).
Gwen's tardiness is just the beginning, though. The drunk young woman
insults the newlyweds during a toast, loses balance while dancing and
falls on the wedding cake, takes off to replace the cake by stealing the
couple's limo, then careens for several blocks before crashing into the
front of a house.
Director Betty Thomas plays the situation for laughs and, judging from
the howling audience at the screening I attended, it appears that
driving while intoxicated isn't appalling  it's funny.
The court system in Movie Land doesn't take it that seriously, either.
Instead of throwing her ass in prison, Gwen is allowed to opt for a mere
28 days in rehab rather than jail. With a massive chip on her shoulder,
she arrives at Serenity Glen, a New-Agey recovery center that
specializes in group chants and sing-alongs.
Thomas shoots for a "M*A*S*H" motif  throughout the film, we hear wacky
announcements over the P.A. system and Loudon Wainwright III, who served
as official camp troubadour on a few episodes of the TV series, does
another tour of duty here. Gwen is surrounded by a group of
one-dimensional fellow patients: tough-as-nails Roshanda (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste), self-loathing Daniel (Reni Santoni), wise guy Oliver
(Mike O'Malley), sacrificial lamb Andrea (Azura Skye) and
easy-target-for-cheap-laughs Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), a gay German
stripper who comes off like the "Sprockets" version of Andy Dick. What a
shame it is to see so many fine character actors used as little more
than props.
Two bits of inspired casting offer brief hope for greater things. Steve
Buscemi, who has popped up as the weird guy in virtually every film made
over the past decade, plays a well-balanced counselor, and Viggo
Mortensen, a specialist in portraying smarmy heels, appeared as a
baseball star who, substance abuse problems aside, is a clean-cut,
stand-up sort of man. Unfortunately, neither actor is given much to do,
as the spotlight remains firmly on Gwen.
Sandra Bullock is good  she generally does her best work when given a
character placed in an extremely tense situation  but Gwen's journey is
too easy. As Stuart Smalley can tell you, breaking self-destructive
behavior patterns is tough business. Compared to what most people
endure, Gwen's rehabilitation is a cakewalk. Revelations and
reconciliation come in tidy little packages, with just enough angst
thrown in to allow Bullock to strut her stuff.
Anyone who has dealt with drug addiction, codependency, compulsive
eating, gambling, etc. can tell you that a key to the recovery process
is learning that, while you are a vital part of the human tapestry, you
are most certainly not the center of the world. "28 Days" trivializes
what it seeks to honor by placing one character's concerns above all
others, and by milking potentially deadly actions for laughs. Sorry,
Sandra, but I'll take the awkward, messy "Stuart Saves His Family" over
faux grit like this anytime.

A few years ago, while reviewing a Denzel Washington film where his
character falls on hard times, I expressed doubt whether he could ever
credibly play a bad guy. The charismatic actor is such a natural Boy
Scout, I speculated, that portraying true evil might simply be beyond
him. Was I ever wrong. In "Training Day," Washington pulls out all the
stops and delivers a hell of a performance. And when you see the film,
you'll understand why "hell" is such a fitting word. Written by David
Ayer and directed by Anthony Fuqua, "Training Day" grabs you by the nape
of the neck and hauls you through a contemporary nightmare. While the
ending suffers from an overload of coincidences and contrivances, the
movie still packs a wallop as it asks the question: Can honorable men
deal with the worst of humanity on a daily basis without being
corrupted?
Ethan Hawke (or as I've always thought of him, the wince-meister) plays
Jake Hoyt, a Los Angeles cop out to become detective. To that end, he
tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an
undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness. The hitch is that
Jake has only one day to prove his worthiness to Alonzo.
The 13-year veteran narc tears into the kid immediately, challenging his
straight-arrow training. "This is street justice," he declares. "It
takes a wolf to catch a wolf... It's ugly, but it's like that." Within
minutes, Alonzo bullies Jake into smoking a joint laced with a variety
of chemicals. Stoned out of his mind, Jake tries to keep his bearings as
Alonzo tours the grimmest parts of the city, introducing him to one
incredibly dangerous character after another.
Even within his drug haze, the boy soon realizes that Alonzo is not
merely an officer that plays fast and loose with the rules - he's a
full-fledged rogue cop willing to do anything to get what he wants.
Some of the most harrowing moments take place in a neighborhood
completely under the control of thugs. Alonzo lives there, convinced he
is respected by his brutal neighbors due to his ability to work the
system. In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because
of his badge and gun.
Taking place over the course of a single day, "Training Day" builds
momentum and never backs off. The film creates and maintains a sense of
genuine danger. As the proceedings grow ever more dark, you begin to
wonder if the key players can possibly survive the day. Until the last
15 minutes, that is, when the story wraps up too quickly and in far too
pat a fashion.
Regardless, "Training Day" is one of the stronger action/character
studies to be released by a major studio in quite a while. Those able to
withstand the intensity and violence will be rewarded with solid acting
by Ethan Hawke and a towering performance from Denzel Washington, an
artist who still has the capability to surprise.

"Celebrity" opens and closes with a shot of the word "Help!" spelled out 
by a skywriter above Manhattan. After this ramshackle film and last 
year's uncomfortably self-referential "Deconstructing Harry," I wonder if 
Woody Allen has reflected on the very public mess he has made of his life 
and is at last crying out for assistance. 
"You can tell a lot about a society by who it chooses to celebrate," says 
Judy Davis, providing a handy Cliffs Notes summation of the film's 
message for those viewers who may have nodded off. Thirty years ago, the 
statement might have been profound, but after countless examinations of 
the Western world's obsession with celebrity, the line merely serves as 
an indicator of just how clueless Allen has become.
"Celebrity" follows the lives of a pair of neurotic New Yorkers (what a 
surprise!); struggling writer Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) and his ex-wife,
 former schoolteacher Robin (Judy Davis). As Woody's surrogate, Branagh 
does an adept, and often irritating, impression of Allen, reproducing 
every gesture, stammer and tic. In standard Allen fashion, Lee is a whiny 
womanizer seemingly incapable of maintaining an honest, monogamous 
relationship. When not occupied with skirt-chasing, he plays sycophant to 
various big shots, peddling a screenplay about an armored-car heist.
Meanwhile, the high-strung Robin makes tentative stabs at changing her 
life, traveling from a religious retreat (the priest is a television 
celebrity) to a high-profile plastic surgeon (he's followed by a TV crew 
after being christened "the Michelangelo of Manhattan" by Newsweek). 
Eventually, she hooks up with a television producer (Joe Mantegna) and 
becomes an on-air reporter, achieving her own celebrity status.
Lee and Robin's mid-life crises serve as the framework for a series of 
sketches; some quite funny, some very flat and none particularly 
insightful. There's a hilarious backstage scene at a daytime talk show, 
where gangsters, religious figures and neo-Nazis comfortably mingle, 
complaining about their agents while hovering around the buffet table. 
"What is this," says a rabbi in mock chiding tones to a group of jack-
booted thugs, "did the skinheads eat all the bagels?"  
One of the film's best sequences involves Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a 
pampered young superstar given to hard-partying and violent outbursts. 
Even as the police are arresting him for trashing a hotel room and 
terrorizing his date, Lee pitches his script to the glib bad-boy. Thanks 
to the kid's celebrity status, the charges are hastily dropped and Lee is 
swept away to Atlantic City with Leo and his entourage, where he 
continues trying to insinuate himself even as Leo urges him to join in a 
drugged-out orgy. DiCaprio is excellent as the self-absorbed hedonist, by 
the way, using a non-stop stream of compliments and commands to manage 
those around him. 
Unfortunately, for every vignette that works, there are two that don't. 
One of the worst comes when Robin, believing that her Catholic guilt has 
made her less than satisfactory in bed, asks an upscale hooker (Bebe 
Neuwirth) for lessons. After a extremely funny exchange ("What do you 
think about during oral sex?," asks Neuwirth. "The Crucifixion," answers 
Robin), the scene degenerates into a tired let's-use-bananas-to-practice-
blow-jobs routine. Apparently, Woody Allen missed "Fast Times At 
Ridgemont High" and all the other comedies that have used the same bit.
A high-school reunion scene with Lee falls just as flat, with the writer 
making contemptuous observations about his fellow classmates before 
declaring, "Ask not for whom the bell tolls -- or more accurately, for 
whom the toilet flushes." It's hard to imagine those words coming from 
the pen of the man who wrote "Annie Hall."
Beyond the hit or miss nature of the comedy and the discomfort of 
watching Kenneth Branagh do a two hour Woody Allen impression, the 
biggest problem with "Celebrity" is that the concept, as well as Allen's 
shtick, are so very tiresome. After a while, the quips and tart exchanges 
degenerate into mere chatter as the film drags on for what seems like 
forever. Even the impressive mega-cast (stand-outs include DiCaprio, 
Neuwirth, Winona Ryder, Charlize Theron, Melanie Griffith, Famke Janssen, 
Bebe Neuwirth, and Michael Lerner) can't compensate for the lazy writing, 
haphazard style and wearying been-there-done-that nature of the black and 
white movie. "Celebrity" is Woody Allen's 27th feature. Hopefully, he'll 
wait until he has something new to say before doing his 28th.

At a party, a mystery man in white-face, with black lips and no eyebrows, 
approaches from across the room. Fred recognizes him from a dream. "We've 
met before, haven't we?" the man says, smiling dangerously. "I don't 
think so," Fred stammers, "Where was it you think we met?" "At your house.
 In fact, I'm there right now." Fred twitches nervously and says "That's 
fucking crazy, man!" Smoothly, the mystery man pulls out a cell phone and 
barks "Call me. Dial your number." Fred calls his home phone number. 
After two rings, he hears it answered. "I told you I was here," says the 
voice of the mystery man over the phone. Astonished, Fred gazes at the 
man standing in front of him and gasps "How'd you do that?" Staring 
intently at the phone in Fred's hand, the man says "Ask me," then laughs 
like a maniac.
Welcome to "Lost Highway," the latest offering from "Blue Velvet" and 
"Twin Peaks" creator David Lynch. This time around, Lynch dispenses with 
any semblance of traditional storytelling, pushing the weird-o-meter off 
the scale in a baffling excursion into horror noir. 
Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette play Fred and Renee, an edgy couple 
who communicate in a halting, primary school form of dream-speech. Every 
move these two make imparts a sense of dread, a Lynch specialty. Life in 
their orange retro-trendy home goes from creepy to creepier as they find 
a series of videotapes on their doorstep. After a tape reveals that 
someone has filmed the couple while they were sleeping, they call the 
cops. Fred tells the Dragnet boys of his disdain for camcorders, stating 
blandly (and significantly,) "I like to remember things my own way. How I 
remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened."
It's possible the whole film is presented from Fred's tortured point of 
view. Mind you, I'm just guessing here. Anyway, after encountering the 
aforementioned mystery man (played with psychotic gusto by Robert Blake,) 
Fred finds another tape, showing him standing over Renee's dead body. In 
quick fashion, Fred is convicted of murder and locked in a gothic prison 
cell by guard Henry Rollins (whose neck, by the way, is now wider than 
his head.) During a morning cell check, the authorities discover that 
Fred has disappeared, and in his place is Pete (Balthazar Getty,) a dazed 
young auto mechanic who squints a lot. Since Pete isn't Fred, he is 
released from prison by the confused warden. 
Are you still with me? Congratulations. Pete recuperates at home, where 
his parents (Gary Busey and Lucy Butler) watch produce documentaries and 
make cryptic remarks that indicate they might know what happened to their 
son. When he returns to work, psycho-gangster and regular customer Mister 
Eddy (Robert Loggia) shows up with his girlfriend Alice (also played by 
Arquette.) Despite having watched Mister Eddy pistol whip a discourteous 
driver while screaming highway safety statistics, Pete decides to have an 
affair with Alice. This leads to a numbing series of schemes and 
surrealistic images, punctuated by lots of ultra-violence. Eventually, 
just after having sex in the desert night beneath the headlights of a car,
 Pete turns back into Fred, the mystery man pops up repeatedly, and the 
film loops back around in moebius strip fashion.
So, what does it all mean? Well, maybe Fred killed his wife, but couldn't 
cope with the consequences. Trapped in his cell, he falls into a dream 
and imagines he is transformed into another man and freed. In short order,
 though, he becomes involved with another incarnation of the woman he 
murdered, finding that even a psychotic state of mind affords no escape 
from his personal Hell. Or maybe he did change identities, only to be 
pursed by the wrathful spirit of Renee. I'm just guessing here. 
It's also possible that the whole thing is just beautifully photographed 
smoke and mirrors from a gifted director who has painted himself into a 
creative corner. David Lynch has been blending sex, violence, 
doppelgangers, surrealism and deadpan humor for years, upping the outrage 
level with each new work. Maybe this is just where he ended up, on his 
own Lost Highway, performing dazzling, but meaningless cinematic card 
tricks. I honestly don't know whether Lynch's work here is ballsy or 
merely desperate. If you see "Lost Highway" and figure out what going on, 
drop me a line, okay?

For "Original Sin," the road to the screen has been rocky. Initially
slated for release last November, the film was bumped twice, finally
landing in the dog days of summer 2001. Advance screenings of the film
were denied to all but a few critics, generally a sign that the studio
realizes it has a dud on its hands. So is "Original Sin" really all that
bad?
Yes it is, but the melodrama does offer some rewards. The location
settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of T&A (with
Angelina Jolie providing the "T" and Antonio Banderas the "A"). More
importantly, the movie is entertainingly bad. Veteran readers know that,
as a rule, I don't encourage people to patronize lousy films. Most of
the time, there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that
are more deserving of our money and besides, the "let's go laugh at the
failings of others" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me
uncomfortable.
But things are different this summer. Quality films, to put it mildly,
have been few and far between, so as far as I'm concerned, it's fair to
find our kicks where we may. "Original Sin" will never join such
treasures as "Valley of the Dolls," "Road House" and "Showgirls" in the
Bad Movie Hall of Fame, but it'll do until something worse comes along.
The film, adapted by director Michael Cristofer from the Cornell
Woolrich novel, "Waltz into Darkness" (which was also the source for the
1969 Francois Truffaut film, "Mississippi Mermaid"), opens in a
turn-of-the-century prison, as Jolie's character, slated for a dawn
execution, tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately
horny. The freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she
says things like, "This is not a love story, it is a story about love."
Wary of local gold-diggers, Cuban coffee dealer Luis Antonio Vargas
(Banderas) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from America,
listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers. A
practical man, Luis chooses a frumpy looking lady, hoping she will be a
loyal mate able to provide him with children. Imagine his surprise when
his fiancée, Julia Russell (Jolie), turns out to be infinitely more
attractive than the woman in the photo.
Julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she
didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face. Luis then
confesses his deception, leading Julie to state, with great
significance, "We have something in common, We are both not to trusted."
After their wedding, Luis and Julia retire for a glorious night of
carefully choreographed lovemaking, with their bodies positioned to
display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible. Jolie and
Banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun, although
the filmmakers' insistence on using one of Banderas' legs to cover
Jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her.
Luis, the stupidest man who ever lived, immediately instructs the bank
to make his personal and business accounts available to Julia, despite
the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he
corresponded. His blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs
mount up. Luis must force Julia to write to her sister Emily, who is
frantic over her lack of communication. Shortly after Julia complains
about the chirping of a pet bird, it is found on the floor of its cage
with a broken neck. Finally, when she cleans out his accounts and
disappears, Luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong.
Incidentally, if you're afraid I'm giving too much away, rest assured
that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie, leaving
plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists, a great deal of operatic
acting and more footage of her tits and his ass.
Along the way, private detective Walter Downs (played by Thomas Jane,
who was terrific as Mickey Mantle in the HBO movie "61*") turns up,
hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real
Julia. Luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con
artist, having decided that if he can't have her, he will kill her. Oh,
the pathos of it all.
The cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story, adjusting
their performances accordingly. Banderas is suitably impassioned, while
Jolie alternates between vamping and pouting (and with those lips, she
can really pout). As for Thomas Jane, he starts off acting suspicious
and cagey, then accelerates to a Snidely Whiplash level of nastiness.
His most startling moment comes when, to prove his power to humiliate,
he forces Luis against a wall, verbally taunts him while rubbing his
cheeks against those of Luis and then finishes establishing his
dominance with a full-on kiss. If anyone ever questions the difference
between sex and rape, show them this chilling scene.
And if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a
laughable potboiler, show them "Original Sin."

At one point in the controversial religious comedy "Dogma," an
irritated apostle turns to a human and snaps, "I have issues with
anyone who treats God like a burden rather than a blessing, the way
some of you Catholics do. You people don't celebrate your faith; you
mourn it." Amen! There are few things more annoying than "true
believers" who squander the miracle of life by trudging joylessly
through their days, scowling at the wonders around them while passing
judgment on anyone who does not adhere to their particular
interpretation of "divine truth."
Take, for example, the Catholic League, who has spent months
campaigning against "Dogma." They haven't actually seen the film, mind
you, but they did read a version of the script over the Internet and
that was good enough to set off a series of protests from the outraged
members.
Writer, director and practicing Catholic Kevin Smith, the man behind
"Clerks," "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy," tackles a lot in his fourth
feature. If anything, "Dogma" suffers from trying to cram too many
ideas into one movie. Stripped of its mountain of biblically sound
exposition, the story boils down to this: two renegade angels, cast
out of Heaven, find a theological loophole that will allow them back
in. Unfortunately, if they succeed in their quest, they will prove God
fallible and our world will wink out of existence. So a distant
descendent of a pivotal religious figure gets recruited to stop them.
"Dogma" is a wildly uneven film. Dense and overly talky, it is
consistently funny, vulgar and thought provoking. Moments of sheer
brilliance bang into segments of juvenile crap (I mean that
literally. In the movie's grossest scene, our heroes do battle with a
shit demon). Simple, eloquent statements about spirituality collide
with self-righteous tirades as excessively pious as those typically
made by the organized religion blowhards being satirized. "Dogma" is a
mess, but a glorious one. This is clearly a labor of love and
devotion. As with his previous works, Kevin Smith doesn't know when to
shut up. Another script rewrite and some severe editing would help the
story immeasurably. Still, "Dogma" remains an exhilarating treat that
couldn't have been created by any other author.
Your enjoyment of the film will depend in large part on your reaction
to Jay and Silent Bob, two mainstays of Kevin Smith movies who get a
lion's share of screen time here. I find the hapless stoners
hilarious. Jay (Jason Mewes) is an explosive motormouth obsessed with
getting laid (after an encounter with a deity in female form, he
confesses to getting a stiffy). His constant companion Silent Bob
(director Kevin Smith) is a stout, stoic soul who always manages to
come through when it counts. Together they make up the funniest duo
since Abbott and Costello.
But Jay and Silent Bob are just two of a cavalcade of unique
characters. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do fine work as Loki and
Bartleby, the rampaging angels causing all the trouble. Their
squabbles and philosophical discussions are consistently
engaging. Chris Rock is a hoot as Rufus, the smart aleck 13th apostle
(he believes he was edited out of the Bible because of his skin
color). Salma Hayek and Jason Lee make lively appearances as a pair of
muses with decidedly different outlooks. And, get this: George Carlin
plays Cardinal Glick, the personification of all that is wrong with
organized religion. To make the church more palatable to contemporary
citizens, he cooks up a public relations campaign called "Catholicism
- - Wow!" that replaces the old, "depressing" crucifix with a new
icon, the "Buddy Christ": a cheesy, brightly colored Jesus who flashes
a toothy smile while pointing at the faithful and giving them a big
thumbs-up.
Anchoring all this lunacy is Metatron (Alan Rickman), a weary angel
who serves as the earthly voice of God, and Bethany (Linda Fiorentino)
a faith-impaired Catholic reluctantly drawn into the role of
savior. Rickman and Fiorentino are wonderful as the best-drawn
characters in the story. A subdued waterside conversation between the
two marks one of the most touching parts of the film.
The release of "Dogma" will likely bring a storm of damnation from
various commentators representing the religious establishment. I
suggest you see the film and decide for yourself. Despite its flaws
and excesses, I found the production extremely entertaining and very
spiritual. I lost both of my parents over the last year and, in the
months since, have found myself numb in areas of faith. The night
after seeing "Dogma," I finally closed my eyes and had a long
conversation with God. Thanks for the nudge, Kevin.

Entering a teenage girl's bedroom, a group of renegade toy soldiers spot 
her collection of Barbie-style dolls on the shelf. "Ooooh, fully poseable,
" leers one of the plastic warriors, "Permission for R&R, sir!" 
Based solely on its trailers, "Small Soldiers" has been dismissed by some 
as a "Toy Story" rip-off, but they're mistaken. Actually, it's a 
"Gremlins" rip-off, directed by Joe Dante, who also helmed both of the 
"Gremlin" films. Packed with comic mayhem and loads of pop culture 
references, "Small Soldiers" is enjoyable lightweight summer fare, 
despite its threadbare storyline and anemic characters.
Set in the same beatific small town where all the people in Steven 
Spielberg productions live, "Small Soldiers" deals with action figures 
run amuck. Implanted with computer chips pirated from the military, two 
groups of toys go to war, with the Commando Elite soldiers determined to 
eradicate the peaceful Gorgonites, and any humans who help them.  
It's a simple, but cute concept that pays off with some big laughs, 
although the finished product doesn't live up to its potential, due to a 
number of poor choices from the filmmakers. 
The human cast is painfully bland, just another group of sit-com 
stereotypes. There's the bumbling teen hero, his preoccupied father and 
ineffectual mother, the beautiful girl next door, her boobish parents, 
etc., etc. They're all sketchy as can be, making it difficult to care 
when they get in trouble. Only the late, greatly missed Phil Hartman 
makes any impression, adding what bite he can as the neighbor girl's 
loutish dad. 
Okay, since we don't care about the humans, what about the toys? Here's 
where things really get odd. The appeal of a film like "Small Soldiers" 
comes from the wish-fulfillment notion of seeing the toy soldier battles 
we staged as children come to life, but it doesn't play out quite the way 
you might expect. 
The Commando Elite soldiers are actually the bad guys, little military 
psychopaths out to defeat the enemy at all costs. And the Gorgonites, 
monster action figures with peaceful hearts, have been pre-programmed by 
the toymakers as timid losers. Their characters are sympathetic and 
appealing, but we don't get a chance to know them, because their 
programming ordains that they stay out of sight as much as possible. 
Why would a toymaker program one of its armies to lose? I certainly have 
no idea. Why would Joe Dante make a film without sympathetic characters? 
Now, that one's easy. It's because Dante is far more interested in satire 
and mayhem than in people. As with both of the "Gremlin" films, he loves 
to fixate on funny, nasty little monsters, while whipping up colorful 
ways to destroy them. 
Ultimately, comic mayhem is all that "Small Soldiers" delivers. 
Thankfully, Dante is pretty good at it. He uses the Commando Elite 
soldiers to send up countless war movie stereotypes. Look for satiric 
nods at everything from "Apocalypse Now" to "The Dirty Dozen." 
Speaking of the "Dirty Dozen," don't be surprised if you get a strong 
sense of deja vu, as several veterans of the 1967 World War II flick turn 
up here. Ernest Borgnine provides the voice of Commando Kip Killagin, 
with Jim Brown as Butch Meathook, George Kennedy as Brick Bazooka and 
Bruce Dern as Link Static. Tommy Lee Jones heads the troops as leader 
Chip Hazard.
Keep your ears peeled for another mini-reunion, with "Spinal Tap" stars 
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer providing voices for 
the Gorgonites. Frank Langella plays Archer, the spokesman for the gentle 
monsters.
"Small Soldiers" virtually bursts at the seams with pop culture 
references. Standing over a fallen comrade, leader Chip Hazard solemnly 
intones, "his battery has died, but his memory keeps going and going and 
going." A doorbell rings the key notes from "Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind," one of several nods to executive producer Steven Spielberg. 
Dante even makes references to his own work, with "Gizmo" turning up as 
an online password.
Seamlessly blending computer graphics with live action footage, the film 
has a number of well-done set pieces. Particularly striking is a creepy 
sequence where the Commandos fit the neighbor girl's "Gwendy" dolls with 
computer chips, leading to a nightmarish Barbie-goes-berserk scene where 
the young woman finds herself under attack from her own dolls. "Let's 
give her a makeover," says one psycho-Gwendy ominously, while another 
horribly mutilated doll coos "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful."
There's a lot of clever moments in "Small Soldiers," but ultimately the 
film still feels like a warmed-over "Gremlins." Joe Dante has a real 
knack for cartoonish sadism and light satire, but he's covered this turf 
before. Had the human characters been less bland, or the Gorgonites less 
timid, they might have provided the spark to ignite this story's 
potential. As it is, "Small Soldiers" is another sterile summertime 
trifle, frenetic, funny and quickly forgettable.

Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
The Horse Whisperer (1998)
Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Neill, 
Dianne Wiest, Chris Cooper, Cherry Jones, Ty Hillman. Directed by Robert 
Redford. 168 minutes.
PG-13, 4 stars (out of five stars)

During one of "The Horse Whisperer's" most lyrical scenes, a horse panics 
and runs away. Tom Booker, assigned the task of calming the troubled 
animal, does not chase him. Instead, he walks into the field and waits. 
Minutes turn to hours as Tom continues to wait for the animal in silence. 
Finally, after waiting all day, Tom's patience is rewarded as the horse 
quiets and returns to him on its own accord. "The Horse Whisperer" is 
filled with understated moments like that. Poetic, dignified and deeply 
humane, the film is a rarity, a rich character-driven tale with brains, 
heart and integrity.
Based on Nicholas Evans' best-selling novel, the story focuses on 14-year-
old Grace MacLean, emotionally and physically crippled following a tragic 
riding accident. Grace isn't the only traumatized party. Her beloved 
horse Pilgrim turns wild, and several handlers tell the family that the 
horribly wounded creature will never recover and should be "put down." 
But Grace's mother Annie, sensing that her daughter's recovery is somehow 
linked to the horse, refuses and seeks another solution. After reading an 
article about horse whisperers, people with an almost mystical ability 
for reaching troubled horses, she seeks out the legendary Tom Booker and 
asks for help. Ignoring his brusque refusal, Annie takes a leave of 
absence from her job as a high-powered New York magazine editor, packs up 
both horse and daughter and heads for Tom's Montana ranch. 
Much like another print sensation, "The Bridges of Madison County," "The 
Horse Whisperer" was derided by some as mawkish and melodramatic. And, 
just as Clint Eastwood did with James Waller's book, Robert Redford has 
taken Evans' words and transformed them into a beautifully crafted film 
that draws a strong emotional reaction honestly, with well-drawn 
characters and intelligent dialogue. 
"The Horse Whisperer" is a long movie, just under three hours, but the 
length is justifiable. As the story moves from Manhattan to Montana, 
Redford changes the rhythm, placing the audience in a setting where 
things move with a more deliberate, thoughtful pace. Although the Montana 
setting is idyllic, Redford doesn't take cheap shots at those who live in 
the city. Instead, he presents two approaches to navigating through life, 
contrasting those who push for quick answers with those who take the time 
to observe, listen and thing things through.
That's the secret behind a horse whisperer's "mystical" ability. Tom 
Booker, as played by director Redford, is a man whose magic comes from 
paying attention. He learns about Pilgrim by watching the horse and the 
people who love it. Along the way, he also learns what Grace needs, 
giving her space when she demands it and structure when she requires it. 
And, much to his surprise, he learns what Annie needs as well.
Stories about young people trying to recover from traumatic incidents are 
nothing new, of course. "Ordinary People," the first film Redford 
directed, dealt with a tortured youth and the strained relationship 
between him and his mother. Redford handles this sort of thing well 
because he doesn't take the easy route. There are no villains in "The 
Horse Whisperer." People make mistakes, but they learn from them. People 
are faced with difficult choices and they make reasoned decisions. 
Redford creates the kind of world that could be, if only all of us would 
try harder, care more and take responsibility for our own actions and the 
effect those actions might have on others. You don't see that in movies 
very often anymore.
The acting in"The Horse Whisperer" is as good as its script. The always 
dependable Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper are strong as Tom's brother and 
sister-in-law, and Sam Neill is sturdy as Grace's father, shining in a 
beautifully written speech towards the end of the film. Scarlett 
Johansson strikes just the right notes as Grace, capturing the pain the 
young woman suffers without ever overplaying the angst. As Annie, "The 
English Patient's" Kristin Scott Thomas takes risks, displaying the 
abrasive, brittle side of her character along with her many sympathetic 
qualities. 
Redford is excellent as Tom Booker. He could easily have made the 
character a noble icon, or overplayed the down-home, "Aw shucks" cowboy 
business. Instead, Redford creates an erudite, well-spoken man who has 
loved, lost and learned from the experience. It's an strong, nuanced, 
honest performance. About the only area where Redford cheats a little is 
in the lighting. Throughout the film, the sun mostly shines on Redford 
from the back or side, minimizing the wrinkles on the aging actor's face. 
Good for him! In a film as benign and forgiving as "The Horse Whisperer," 
it's only fair to forgive Redford for showing a little bit of vanity. He 
deserves it.

One of the most amazing things about "Tarzan" is that it has taken this 
long for someone to produce an animated version of the Edgar Rice 
Burroughs adventure. With a lead character who talks with apes and 
routinely performs physical feats of superhuman ability, the jungle king 
has always seemed a natural for the form. Even Burroughs said so back in 
the '30s, with the caveat "the cartoon must be good. It must approximate 
Disney excellence." Done and done. Disney's "Tarzan" is a corker; a 
robust, remarkably kinetic realization of Burroughs' grand, preposterous 
fable. The most successful melding of classic and modern Disney styles to 
date, "Tarzan" takes the essence of the venerable tale and presents it in 
a streamlined form, filled with drama, humor and amazing vitality. 
The enduring popularity of "Tarzan" (47 films prior to this one, not to 
mention the TV series, comics and, of course, Burroughs' many books) is 
easy to understand. A kid grows up in the wild, away from all societal 
rules, to become a living legend, a hero routinely having fantastic 
adventures in an exotic world. Burroughs cooked up an incredibly juicy 
premise that neatly encapsulates virtually everyone's escapist fantasies, 
not to mention their sexual ones. Be honest, between Tarzan, the near-
naked jungle stud, and Jane, the prim Englishwoman who defies propriety 
to embrace the wild life, you've had a dirty thought or two.
Unfortunately, most "Tarzan" movies are formulaic crap. For every gem 
like 1934's "Tarzan and His Mate" (starring Johnny Weissmuller and 
Maureen O'Sullivan, the definitive Tarzan and Jane), there has been a 
steady stream of pure dreck, with trite situations and stock footage 
substituting for creativity. The nadir came last year with "Tarzan and 
the Lost City," a godawful mess with walking mannequin Casper Van Diem 
striking poses for 108 torturous minutes.  
Disney restores the luster to the franchise with its "Tarzan," a lush, 
economic offering which minimizes many well-known story points in favor 
of character development and swirling visuals. Although romance plays a 
part in the film, this "Tarzan" is primarily a coming-of-age story, as 
the young ape-man wonders why he is so different from the other apes and 
tries to find his place in the family, while his disapproving surrogate 
father glares from the distance (for a family-friendly company, Disney 
sure produces a lot of movies where at least one parent is either 
emotionally inaccessible or dead).
"Tarzan" takes care of the story basics with a dazzling opening montage 
set to Phil Collins' song, "Two Worlds," adroitly jumping between 
parallel shots of humans and apes. One breathtaking image flash-cuts from 
a human family cowering in a boat to an ape family huddled in the jungle. 
In short order, Tarzan's parents are killed by a leopard in their 
treehouse sanctuary, and Kala (Glenn Close), a grief-stricken gorilla 
mother who lost her child to a leopard, discovers the infant orphan. She 
adopts the squirming pink baby against the wishes of Kerchak (Lance 
Henriksen), her mate and leader of the tribe. As the child grows, he 
struggles to be accepted by his ape brethren, keeping up with the tribe 
by swinging on vines and "surfing" moss-covered tree limbs. Eventually, 
of course, humans show up and yadda yadda, you know the rest.
Thankfully, "Tarzan" is not a musical and Phil Collins' songs serve to 
propel, rather than interrupt, the story (incidentally, while I've been 
burned out on Collins for years, his rhythm-heavy tunes are surprisingly 
effective in this context). Although the artwork represents another leap 
forward for Disney, the company continues to cling to the tried and true, 
so Tarzan is provided two comic sidekicks. Wayne Knight is fine as a 
neurotic elephant, but Rosie O'Donnell, as a smart-ass ape, is a bit 
annoying, largely due to her grating voice. 
The rest of the actors are exemplary. Alex D. Linz voices Tarzan as a boy,
 with Tony Goldwyn as the adult ape-man, and both are very good. 
Particularly strong is Minnie Driver, providing Jane a nicely layered 
personality. Together, they make the oft-told story seem fresh and 
Tarzan's identity and cultural crisis genuinely poignant.
But the main appeal of the film remains the knockout combination of art 
and music. Beyond the thrilling action scenes, some of the best images 
are the smallest. When the infant Tarzan yawns and stretches, watch the 
movement of his tiny rib cage and belly. This baby actually moves like a 
baby - a rarity in cartoons. The depth and detail in the jungle vistas 
are equally impressive, as Disney continues to up the ante in animation. 
"Tarzan" may not be quite as compelling as some Disney films, but it 
still ranks as one of their strongest efforts to date, a rich melange of 
comedy, drama and adventure surrounded by some of the dandiest eye candy 
I've seen in a long time.

"Blow" is based on the real life experiences of George Jung, once one of
the most successful illegal drug importers on the planet. Back in the
late '60s and early '70s, the psychedelic youth brigade of America
whiled away their free time peacefully with assorted hallucinogens and
all the marijuana they could get their hands on. Then George entered the
marketplace with incredible quantities of cocaine and the scene turned
ugly.
In other words, George Jung was the kid who spoiled it for the rest of
the class.
Jung claims responsibility for bringing in at least 85 percent of the
cocaine that entered the United States during the late 1970s. Hmmmmm. It
may be true, but then again, former vice-president Al Gore claims that
the lead characters in "Love Story" were based on him and his wife,
Tipper. And for what it's worth, I single-handedly popularized salt and
vinegar potato chips in the Midwest.
Regardless, Jung is generally acknowledged as the key American behind
the cocaine tsunami. After reading Brian Porter's decades-spanning
rags-to-riches-to-rags biography about the Uber-dealer, director Ted
Demme ("Monument Avenue") decided this was a story that must be
presented on the big screen. Had "Scarface," "Goodfellas" and "Boogie
Nights" never been made, he might have been right. But in the wake of
those movies, "Blow" is unable to overcome a "been there, done that"
feel. To be fair, there are perks to be had. Johnny Depp contributes a
fine performance in the lead role, a few of the supporting players are
decent and Demme offers some nice stylistic touches. Still, the
production comes off as little more than a variation of a well-worn
theme.
The story begins in George's 1950s childhood home in Massachusetts. His
father Fred (Ray Liotta) is a plumber with a strong work ethic and an
even stronger love of his boy, while his shrewish mother Ermine (Rachel
Griffiths) seems more concerned with her standing in the neighborhood
than with the well being of her family.
In 1968, George and his best friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) move to a
California beach town, where they discover the joys of girls and ganja.
When their cash runs short, the boys decide that  get ready for this 
they could make money by (a drum roll, please) selling marijuana! The
film presents this as if it was the first time anyone came up with such
a concept.
George's stewardess girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente from "Run Lola
Run") hooks him up with Derek (Paul Reubens), a sly hairdresser who
enjoys freaking out newcomers with his effeminate mannerisms. Derek
fronts the boys a bag of weed and, in short order, they establish a
lively business with the college crowd back in Boston, manageable
because of Barbara's ability to serve as courier.
Cut to 1970, where George and Barbara live large while operating out of
Acapulco, until George gets popped in Chicago with over 600 pounds of
the herb. He ends up serving time with Colombian Diego Delgado (Jordi
Molla), who hooks him up with the Medellin drug cartel. Bada bing, bada
boom, George becomes THE Colombian cocaine pipeline to the States.
Needless to say, there are complicating factors. Visits with the parents
are dicey, as Mom has a nasty habit of calling the cops on her son.
George creates ill will by wooing and eventually marrying Mirtha
(Penelope Cruz), the squeeze of a Medellin big wheel. Finally, George's
friends in the cartel are mighty interested in learning the name of his
main connection on the West Coast.
While the film has a number of powerful scenes, the story arc is just as
you would expect and, when the inevitable downfall begins, everything
drags. Demmes tries to jazz things up by using camera gimmicks common to
each decade of the story (faux home movies for the '50s, rainbow
zippiness for the '60s, washed out colors and lots of zooms for the
'70s, yadda, yadda, yadda). The visuals are moderately engaging, but not
enough to overcome the overwhelming sense of déjŕ vu.
The same goes with the performances. Depp is very good and Liotta
provides welcome support as the loving, nonjudgmental papa.
Unfortunately, to denote the passage of time, both men must wear fake
bellies that are, ahem, a bit less than convincing. Paul Reubens also
does solid work, creating a sense of playful wickedness in his
supporting role. The rest of the cast is comprised of the expected
stereotypes, with Griffiths and Cruz consistently annoying as one-note
harridans.
While "Blow" has a fair share of rewards, it is a decidedly minor movie.
Still, many early reviews of the film have been positively gushing. Why?
I can think of only one reason  when they saw the flick, them damn
critics were all hopped up on coke.

What a pleasant way to wrap up the summer film season. Leisurely and 
smart, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" is the cinematic equivalent of 
sipping an umbrella drink on a warm, breezy evening. There's no meteors 
racing towards Earth here, no wisecracking cops, evil spies or government 
conspiracies. There's not a single explosion in the film. "How Stella Got 
Her Groove Back" is the kind of movie that invites you to relax, ease 
back in your seat and simply enjoy spending a couple of lazy hours with a 
group of likable, extremely well-drawn characters. 
Based on the novel by Terry McMillan (who co-wrote the film with Ron 
Bass), "Stella" is a laid-back, intelligent and often funny love story, 
gently examining how pursuing financial security and adhering to social 
rules can divert a person from the things that really matter. Some 
critics dismissed the novel, stating that in contrast to her other books 
("Mama," "Disappearing Acts" and "Waiting to Exhale"), "Stella" was just 
a trifle. Having not read any of her work, all I can say is that this 
"trifle" certainly translates wonderfully to the screen.
Stella (Angela Bassett) is 40 years old and settled in her ways. A single 
mother, she juggles a highly successful career as an investment analyst 
with caring for her bright young son. Her friends repeatedly urge her to 
take a break from her heavy workload, but Stella ignores them until one 
day, while her son is away with relatives, she gets a whim and takes off 
with her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) for a vacation in Jamaica.
Once on the Caribbean island, the movie finds its groove, even while 
Stella struggles to locate hers. Brimming with beautiful landscapes, 
gorgeous sunsets and happy tourists, the playful, almost giddy mood is 
infectious. Bassett delivers a smoky, multi-layered performance and 
Goldberg is delightful as the outspoken, horny Delilah, who divides her 
time between trying to help Stella loosen up and trying to get herself 
laid. 
Soon enough, Stella meets Winston (Taye Diggs), a charming, great-looking 
Jamaican man 20 years her junior. Sparks fly, and the two quickly end up 
playing out the kind of magical love affair most vacationers only dream 
of. But what will they do when the vacation is over? Their social, 
cultural and financial worlds are as different as their countries and, of 
course, there's that age-difference business.
Choices are weighed, decisions made, and before you know it, Winston is 
in San Francisco, trying to adjust to life with Stella and her son. 
Naturally, there's complications galore, but while their fates are 
uncertain, it's clear to the viewer that these people were made for each 
other.
If it all sounds too good to be true, try this out for size. The story is 
loosely based on McMillan's real-life affair with a younger Jamaican man, 
who currently lives with her in California. Whether it's sheer writing 
skill, knowledge based on experience or, more likely, a combination of 
the two, McMillan's characters have a depth and resonance uncommon for 
players in such frothy fare. 
The cast has a great time with those characters. Angela Bassett was 
sensational in "What's Love Got To Do With It" and it's nice to see her 
get another major showcase for her skills. After great turns here and in 
"Ghost," Whoopi Goldberg should seriously consider skipping the starring 
roles and focusing her talents on supporting characters. And watch out 
for Taye Diggs. Sexy with an assured, but sweet presence, this 
charismatic young actor has a big future ahead of him.
>From the title alone, it's easy to predict how a film like this will end, 
but getting there is such a pleasure, thanks to fine acting, characters 
you can relate to, and a number of finely spun vignettes. A nice example 
is a scene where Winston meets Stella's ex at a barbecue. When the older 
man sees the young buck with Stella, what does he do? He shares a beer 
with the kid and give him some sage advice. McMillan has a knack for 
taking conventional scenes and zigging where most writers zag, adding a 
fresh feeling to the proceedings. 
Unfortunately, the proceedings go on a bit too long. At roughly two hours,
 "Stella" is about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. Where, oh where,
 are the editors when we really need them? Why can't they realize that 
with elegant, eloquent films like "Stella" and "The Horse Whisperer," 
there definitely can be too much of a good thing?
Despite being overly long, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" remains one 
of the most gratifying films of the summer. After months of enduring 
overblown event movies that failed to deliver on their promises, a warm, 
winning confection like "Stella" serves as a welcome mini-vacation from 
the Hollywood hype merchants.

Kurt Vonnegut acknowledged one of the great truths about life in his
1985 novel, "Galapagos." The narrator of the tale is from 1,000,000
years in the future, when mankind has evolved into beings that bear
scant resemblance to present-day humans. Still, he assures us, some
things never change, even in the distant future. For instance, people
in that era still laugh about as much as we do now. "If a bunch of
them are lying around on a beach," he says, "and one of them farts,
everybody else laughs and laughs, just as people would have done a
million years ago."
Vonnegut is right, of course, though too many of us are loathe to
admit it. Writers like me babble endlessly about the post-modern irony
of the "Scream" series or the deliciously surreal verisimilitude of
"Being John Malkovich," but throw a fart joke our way and we fold up
like a cheap tent. In our insular, oh-so-sophisticated little world,
we turn our noses up at movies that traffic in low humor.
Unless they're old, that is. You see, old low humor is classic, while
new low humor is crude and juvenile. W.C. Fields made a career playing
drunken louts who routinely threatened children and we rave about his
brilliance. But when Adam Sandler plays a slacker who teaches a kid to
pee against a wall, we complain that he's a horrible role model whose
parenting is tantamount to child abuse. If "Blazing Saddles" or
"Animal House" were released today, I guarantee there would be whining
about the lewd humor, not to mention the shameful objectification of
women and tasteless racial and ethnic jokes.
Which brings me (finally) to "Next Friday," the sequel to Ice Cube's
1995 comedy, "Friday." The film, which features a gag involving a big
pile of dog shit in its first five minutes, is packed with fart
jokes. There is also considerable dope smoking, as well as crude
sexual humor and numerous pratfalls. Our heroes are lazy stoners who
steal, most of the women are either brassy or shrill, and the only
male Hispanic characters act like Cheech and Chong on
methamphetamines. In addition, "Next Friday" is sloppily assembled,
with virtually no plot and absolutely no character development.
But it's funny. Imagine a live-action "Nickelodeon" slapstick comedy
with lots and lots of swearing and you'll have an idea of what to
expect. There isn't a sophisticated second in "Next Friday," but for
those willing to loosen up and go with the flow, the burlesque is
often entertaining.
The original "Friday" followed Craig (Ice Cube), a laid-back guy still
living with his parents, through one day in South Central Los Angeles,
climaxing with him duking it out with neighborhood bully Debo (Tommy
"Tiny" Lister) and becoming a hero of sorts. The sequel picks up four
years later. Debo has just broken out of prison and, at his father's
insistence, Craig goes to stay with relatives in the suburbs until
things settle down. Within an hour, he is up to his neck in a new set
of problems.
John Witherspoon, reprising his role as Craig's pop, spends most of
the movie running around with dog poop smeared on his clothes,
blathering about hot sauce while frantically trying to find a
bathroom. His performance is wildly over the top and I tried not to
laugh at his hammy antics, but the man's twitchy abandon was
impossible to resist. Likewise, Craig's sidekicks Day-Day (Indiana
native Mike Epps) and Roach (skateboarder Justin Pierce) make a
likable Mutt and Jeff team, sputtering and falling down a lot as they
play out the film's obligatory wacky scheme.
The women get a chance to overact as well. Tamala Jones and Lady of
Rage behave like "Jerry Springer" guests as D'wana and Baby D, a
wrathful pair aiming their anger at Day-Day. And Kym E. Whitley is
loosey-goosey as Suga, the horny girlfriend of Craig's Uncle Elroy
(Don "D.C." Curry).
Ice Cube serves as the calm center of this group of loons, acting as
an anchor for all the craziness, much like Mary Tyler Moore did in her
old TV series (by the way, this is probably the very first time anyone
has ever compared Ice Cube and Mary Tyler Moore). Cube, who also wrote
the screenplay, remains an enigmatic performer. With each new role, he
becomes a bit more accomplished and, oddly, more opaque. Sometimes it
seems like the stoic actor is trying to disappear in his own movie,
which makes him all the more interesting
Even at a relatively short 95 minutes, the slapstick and bantering
loses steam towards the end. Still, "Next Friday" is mostly good
lowbrow fun. Ten years from now, I doubt if this will be compared to
"Blazing Saddles" or "Animal House." But anyone willing to set aside
their pretensions, lie down on the beach and giggle at the farts is
likely to have a fine time.

In an article that inspired the action-thriller, "Proof of Life,"
William Prochnau wrote, "The huge number of multinational executives
being abducted abroad has made organized kidnapping a big business. It
has also spawned a counter-industry  getting them back  and a secret
drama involving former spies and revolutionaries, AK-47s and armored
cars, helicopter drops and hideaways." With source material as
provocative as that, the resultant film should be a knockout and "Proof
of Life" does contain some moments that deliver on its promise, but far
too much of the film is squandered on the most tedious aspects of a
cumbersome, ill-conceived storyline.
The production starts off right, with commando-turned-hostage negotiator
Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) dodging bullets in Chechnia while rescuing
a victim from his abductors. Shortly after returning home, he gets
dispatched to South America for another mission.
That mission is Peter Bowman (David Morse), an American engineer
snatched by the ELT, a guerrilla outfit that started as a Marxist
organization, but devolved into just a bunch of heavily-armed thugs who
kidnap for a living.
Terry meets with Alice (Meg Ryan), Peter's wife, and settles in for the
negotiations. Because their captive is a corporate employee, the ELT
demands millions. What they don't know is that the company is on the
verge of collapse and has not paid the kidnap insurance bills on its
staff for months. When Terry learns the cold financial truth, he splits,
but something draws him back and he becomes even more determined to come
up with a way to get Peter home.
So far, so good, but the story then settles into mediocrity, cutting
between segments of Peter being mistreated by his dope-smoking,
coke-snorting, gun-toting captors and interminable scenes of the
molasses-slow negotiation process and the growing quasi-romantic
relationship between Terry and Alice. The film eventually delivers a
rousing action set piece, but by then it's too little, too late.
"Proof of Life" is particularly frustrating because you can see the film
it should have been. Scenes between Terry and his adrenaline junkie
cohorts, particularly a jittery operative named Dino ("NYPD Blue" vet
David Caruso), deliver the sense of danger and immediacy that is missing
during most of the movie. The film screams for more edgy camaraderie,
for more adventure, for anything other than more dreary looks at a
half-assed romance.
And half-assed is the operative term. Aside from some intense gazing,
which can be interpreted several different ways, scant evidence of
romantic feelings appear onscreen. A love scene between Russell Crowe
and Meg Ryan was filmed, then scrapped by director Taylor Hackford.
Consequently, a smooch between Terry and Alice late in the film left me
thinking, "Where the hell did that come from?"
The incongruous kiss is just one part of a poorly written script that
plays like a rough draft rather than a finished product. Alice and Terry
are each assigned one painful burden in a pale attempt to flesh them
out. For Alice, it's the memory of a miscarriage. For Terry, it's the
knowledge that his globetrotting job has strained the relationship
between him and his son. Is anything of substance done with this
information? No.
The script is equally inept when depicting Peter's life in captivity,
shooting for a "Midnight Express" vibe, but failing because the captors
are left as stereotypes instead of people. The caricature status given
the terrorists is so blatant that, when one kidnapper displays an
exceptional level of animosity towards Peter, it's obvious he is merely
being set up as an identifiable target for the grand finale. Besides
Peter, only one character at the guerrilla camp is allowed to be human,
fellow prisoner Eric Kessler (Gottfried John, another white guy, of
course).
"Proof of Life" gives viewers a great beginning, solid action near the
end and a closing scene between Terry and Alice that wants to be
haunting and poetic, but falls flat because the script fails to provide
sufficient groundwork for the relationship. The film's long, droopy
middle leaves good actors straining to wring substance out of filler.
Russell Crowe uses his great physicality to carry the home-front portion
of the movie and the talented David Morse manages to add some oomph to
the anemic camp scenes, but Meg Ryan comes off as simply
inconsequential. In supporting roles, David Caruso is wiry and
appealing, while Pamela Reed is strong as Peter's fiercely protective
sister, even though the script quickly softens her fire and ships her
away.
Ultimately, "Proof of Life" takes a great idea and turns it into an
overlong exercise in missed opportunities, punctuated by a few powerful
sequences that show what would have happened had the writer focused on
psychology and adventure instead of uncooked mush.

In the opening moments of "Hollow Man," a rat scurries across the floor,
then hesitates as it hears ominous growling sounds. Suddenly, the
twitching rodent is hoisted into the air by an unseen force and we watch
as something takes a huge chunk out of the hovering animal's body. The
scene is lurid, technically stunning and quite viscous, perfectly
setting the tone for what is to follow.
"Hollow Man," a thriller about an invisible maniac, is a fascinating
piece of work despite its flat, obvious script; thanks to top-notch
special effects and the skewed perspective of director Paul Verhoeven,
the Dutch filmmaker who brought the world "Robocop," "Total Recall,"
"Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers." Verhoeven is to
directing what Spinal Tap is to rock and roll, enthusiastically turning
the control knob up to 11 while assaulting viewers with heavy-handed
bursts of sex and violence. As with most Verhoeven films, "Hollow Man"
is simultaneously campy and creepy. This is a guilty pleasure with the
accent on guilty. After the closing credits, I felt an intense need to
wash my hands.
Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a cocky, but brilliant scientist
trying to perfect an invisibility formula for his backers at the
Pentagon. SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING REVEALS BASIC PLOT POINTS. After
a successful experiment with a gorilla, Caine decides to skip protocol
and try the process on a human being, using himself as the guinea pig.
Without the knowledge of government liaison Dr. Arthur Kramer (William
Devane), Caine convinces his teammates  ex-girlfriend Linda McCay
(Elisabeth Shue), stud muffin Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) and
casualties-waiting-to-happen Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey
(Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick) and Janice Walton (Mary
Randle)  to strap him to the table and inject the serum into his veins.
Within seconds, Caine is writhing in agony as he slowly begins to
disappear, a layer at a time, in a spectacular visual sequence. His skin
fades first, followed by muscles, internal organs and finally his
skeleton. After recovering from the trauma, Caine joins his comrades in
celebrating their success, but their giddiness turns to dread when
attempts to return him to visibility utterly fail.
While his fellow scientists struggle to find a restoration formula,
Caine's behavior takes a drastic downward turn. He begins indulging his
secret urges; copping a feel from a sleeping female teammate and spying
on Linda in the sack. When he makes a trip to the apartment of a
voluptuous neighbor, things take a violent, deeply disturbing turn.
Whether the serum or his own megalomaniacal tendencies trigger the
change is uncertain, but his crew must face the fact that their leader
has gone crazy, and their lives may be forfeit if they can't find a way
to stop him. END SPOILER ALERT.
Story-wise, "Hollow Man" is just a formula horror flick. In fact, Andrew
Marlowe's screenplay fumbles obvious opportunities by mostly confining
Caine to the group compound instead of unleashing him on the public.
Character development is sketchy at best; the supporting players are
one-note and Caine merely slides from being a relatively sophisticated
creep to becoming a much more dangerous one.
While the press notes for the film feature impressive quotes about the
corrupting nature of power, the movie never addresses them. Make no
mistake, "Hollow Man" is simply an exercise in special effects and
grisly cheap thrills. But the special effects are knockouts and it's
fascinating to watch Paul Verhoeven (to paraphrase Monty Burns from "The
Simpsons") wallow in his own directorial crapulence.
Verhoeven grew up in occupied Holland during World War II and witnessed
the ravages of war from a child's point of view. During a recent
interview, he acknowledged (almost grudgingly) that there is goodness in
the human spirit, but made it clear that his interest lies in the dark
side of souls.
Boy howdy! Verhoeven movies are veritable orgies of violence and sex,
with glossy settings and superhuman characters that treat the death of
loved ones lightly (when a scientist's body falls out of a locker, her
friends shriek in surprise, but display no sadness whatsoever) and
handle grave wounds with remarkable ease (one character sticks her
fingers deeply into the stomach wound of a colleague, announces "It
didn't cut any organs," and patches him up with duct tape (!!); then the
pair continue their very strenuous adventures).
It would be easy to mock or dismiss Verhoeven for the cheesy overkill.
In fact, I've done so before, particularly with "Showgirls" and
"Starship Troopers." But this time, I kept thinking of that little boy
in Holland, forced by German troops to look at piles of dead bodies on
the streets. All grown up, he copes with the memories by creating
violent films where sexy, extraordinarily powerful humans fight operatic
battles against the forces of evil. My interpretation could be wrong, of
course, but it sure makes comic book gore-porn like "Hollow Man" a lot
more interesting.
As reporters gathered in Los Angeles to interview the cast and crew of
the invisible man thriller, "Hollow Man," the topic repeatedly drifted
from the spectacular special effects in the movie to the mindset and
behavior of its director, Paul Verhoeven. The 62-year-old Dutch
filmmaker, best known to American audiences for "Robocop," "Total
Recall," "Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers," is
dismissed by detractors as a temperamental auteur preoccupied with
juvenile displays of lurid sex and graphic violence.
But Verhoeven enjoys a fiercely devoted fan base as well and has
received many positive notices from critics, although some are
admittedly of the backhanded quality. For example, Andrew O'Hehir of
Salon Magazine recently comparing the director favorably to Alfred
Hitchcock, stating "Like Hitchcock, Verhoeven is an ice-veined European
expatriate whose sleek filmmaking style cannot conceal the fact that
he's not in control of his own obsessions. For both directors, male
sexual anxiety is at the center of their aesthetic universe, and both
have been accused of hating women."
"Hollow Man" star Elisabeth Shue went into the film aware of Verhoeven's
reputation, but left the set impressed. "I had a great experience with
him," she told me. "He was very supportive of me. He's very demanding
and I think some people misinterpret that side of him. But for me, he
was demanding in a way that made me feel challenged to do really good
work. He's very passionate and I respect that he cares a lot about the
films he's done. I would much rather deal with somebody who was mad
about their film than somebody who could care less."
Kevin Bacon, the Hollow Man himself, said of Verhoeven, "He has a
mercurial kind of personality, he explodes at any minute. He's
incredibly passionate. He has a tremendous kind of single-mindedness
when it comes to the execution of this movie, to getting the job done.
Being a director is a consumptive kind of job ands it requires an
amazing amount of focus, which he has. But the people who work with him
work with him a lot. The crew, for instance, has done picture after
picture with him. He is devoted to them and they are just as devoted to
him. Throughout the process, we eventually were able to establish the
relationship I like to have with a director, where they respect my
opinion about things, about character. I loved working with him."
When Paul Verhoeven finally entered the room for his interview, the
energy was palpable. With scraggy white hair and a pleasantly weathered
face, he speaks in a thick accent; cordial, but commanding. Verhoeven is
quite comfortable holding court, with his booming voice punching every
sentence.
The first thing we had to do was clear up an earlier conversation. While
promoting "Starship Troopers" with phone interviews three years ago,
Verhoeven had insisted to me that the wildly over-the-top feature was
absolutely not a satire. It was simply a war movie set in outer space.
The only satire was in the film's news broadcasts and propaganda ads, he
told me at the time. Now, he wanted to amend his remarks.
"I think there was a misunderstanding," he said. "What I meant was that
during the war scenes I am not commenting on it in any, let's say,
ironic or satirical way. I'm just basically showing them as they are;
they are shot like real war scenes. It's just because of the context,
and the juxtaposition with other stuff, and the structure of the movie,
that you start to feel the idea was to put you into the war in a
realistic way and then be subversive, to show to you that you were,
basically, an idiot and a fool to cooperate. That was the idea. I pull
you in and then ask yourself 'Am I an idiot? What is this society and
why did I participate in this? Why did I go along with these people?'"
Fair enough. But why do his films always seem to end up dealing with man
at his most grim, with death and destruction everywhere? He answered
fast, obviously having dealt with this question many times before. "Am I
fascinated with showing the dark side? I would say so. In American
culture, there is always a tendency to look on the positive side, which
is great, but I'm not sure that's the full truth. I think there are a
lot of things hidden under the surface in this country, in any country,
and sometimes it breaks to the surface. The shadow is there. We all have
to deal with the shadow in everybody. How strong and how dominant that
will be, probably that's a character thing or an environmental thing.
But I've always been interested in that aspect of humanity because you
see it displayed in the universe or on Earth in such a brutal way.
Especially in the century we just left  I think 70 million people got
killed, you know? More than anything you could ever imagine."
Verhoeven spent several minutes rambling on about the brutality of
nature, often referring to an article he had read about two galaxies
colliding with each other, and the indescribable destruction that must
result from such an occurrence. He seemed simultaneously horrified and
thrilled while describing the cataclysm. Eventually, his fever pitch
softened and he dropped from the nether reaches of space to his own
childhood. There was no hint of self-pity as he spoke. He simply got a
little quieter.
"I grew up in occupied Holland," he said, "and I saw there were a lot
of people got killed by bombing, or resisters that were shot on the
streets by Germans. I was about seven when the war stopped. When I was
five, six, seven, we lived in the Hague and were constantly bombed
there, not by the Germans, but by the English. Our house was about a
mile from the rocket launching pads, where they launched the B-1's and
B-2's to England, and the English and Americans were constantly bombing
that area. The area around us, with the exception of the street we lived
on and a couple of others, were completely destroyed. I remember the
flames and the people being killed. And the Germans  one evening I
remember walking with my father and suddenly we were held by Germans and
they said 'You cannot walk there, you have to walk here and look at
something.' And we walked there and saw 20 people they had taken out of
prison and shot. They put them against the wall and shot them and made
sure that everyone going home passed them. Dead bodies there, yeah, I
remember all that. So you may be more optimistic than I am."
Ladies and gentlemen, meet Paul Verhoeven.

"Apt Pupil" is one of the more peculiar films to come down the pike in 
quite some time. While the psychological horror story of the relationship 
between a teenage boy and a Nazi war criminal is certainly creepy, 
director Bryan Singer maintains an odd sense of distance that blunts the 
effectiveness of the production. We expect a probing examination of the 
essence of evil, but the film stays too close to the surface to deliver 
any insight. As a result, using a Nazi as the bogeyman feels arbitrary 
and vaguely exploitative rather than dramatically justifiable. 
Set in 1984, the story (based on a Stephen King novella) introduces young 
Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro), a high school honor student who becomes 
fixated on Nazis and Holocaust imagery during sociology class and 
continues his private research at the local library. Bowden, a resident 
of Incredible Coincidences, California, notices that one of his fellow 
bus passengers bears a striking resemblance to a Nazi war criminal. 
Several weeks later, the boy shows up on the doorstep of Kurt Dussander 
(Ian McKellen), threatening to expose the man unless he tells him, 
"everything they're afraid to tell us in school." 
And so the relationship begins, with the grizzled old man recounting 
tales of atrocities while the kid sits transfixed, drinking in every word.
 As their symbiosis-by-blackmail continues, two things happen: Bowden 
becomes increasingly demanding and dictatorial as his obsession grows, 
while Dussander finds his long dormant sadism resurfacing. Clearly, it's 
only a matter of time before the wily old man figures a way to turn the 
tables on his young master.
The psychological study of Bowden and Dussander is very intriguing, but 
director Bryan Singer doesn't sufficiently explore the psyches of his 
characters, leaving us with an aged one-dimensional monster and an 
underdeveloped monster-in-training. The actors are definitely not the 
problem. The remarkable Ian McKellan is skilled enough to give his 
character more depth than the anemic script provides (although he moves 
into caricature during an over-the-top goose-stepping scene), and Renfo 
is no slouch, maintaining a fierce focus that makes his fresh-scrubbed 
innocent appearance all the more chilling.  
At first the Nazi imagery is appropriately disturbing, but as the film 
wore on, it felt more and more like a simple gimmick; just another in a 
long line of Stephen King creep-outs. The story's level of coincidence is 
absurd. After successfully eluding the authorities for decades, McKellan 
gets spotted not once, but twice during the course of the tale. I'm 
willing to suspend disbelief to an extent, but two separate discoveries 
doesn't just strain credulity, it snaps it in two.
Beyond the film's problems with structure and logic, I also found certain 
shots of Renfro more than a little disquieting. Early in the film there's 
an aerial view of the youth resting on his bed wearing only boxers. The 
camera moves over the smooth curves of his underage body, sensuously 
accented by moonlight. Later, in a shower scene, we get a teasing shot of 
the boy's rear, followed by a front view oh-so-carefully framed to barely 
conceal his genitals, while displaying as much of his perfectly lit body 
as possible. While I enjoy looking at an attractive physique as much as 
anyone, these loving displays of the body of a minor made me 
uncomfortable. If the filmmakers want to flash some beefcake, I'd prefer 
they use grown-up subjects. 
"Apt Pupil" shows evil as a force that is communicable, but doesn't 
provide the all-important character development that would explain the 
mechanics and motivations. It purports to be an examination of what 
drives humans to commit acts of indescribable horror, but barely scrapes 
the surface. By staying in the wading pool rather than taking a high dive,
 the film leaves us only with a compelling, if contrived, psychological 
cat and mouse story. Making matters worse, the story stretches on too 
long and even throws in the inexcusable cliché of a supposed corpse 
springing back to life for one more cheap scare. "Apt Pupil" had 
incredible potential, but in the hands of Bryan Singer and scripter 
Brandon Boyce, it ends up just a moderately involving creep show, and a 
veritable cavalcade of missed opportunities.

In 1991, "Less Than Zero" author Bret Easton Ellis stirred up a hornet's
nest with "American Psycho," possibly the most reviled book of the
decade. The novel detailed the thoughts of Patrick Bateman, a yuppie
obsessed with status and murder, offering non-stop brand name dropping
and surgically explicit descriptions of the mutilations of his prey.
Outraged readers denounced the story as a misogynist (most of the
victims were female) piece of gore-porn.
Nine years later, "American Psycho" returns to the spotlight as a film,
written and directed by women.
Director Mary Harron, who co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner,
dismisses the critics, calling the novel "a brilliant social satire and
a devastating portrait of the 1980s." By keeping most of the violence
off camera, she has crafted a highly stylized fable, a combination
creep-show and pitch-black comedy that steadily builds to an almost
hallucinatory climax. While virtually every element of the film was
better explored in last year's exceptional "Fight Club," Harron's
adaptation holds several distinct rewards.
Chief among them is the performance of cult favorite Christian Bale
("Empire of the Sun," "A Midsummer Night's Dream") as Patrick Bateman.
Bale looks like an elongated, stressed-out Tom Cruise and adopts an
upscale Eastern American accent. He starts with a mildly exaggerated
power tone that gradually escalates to full hysteria, venturing
extremely close to caricature while never quite crossing the line.
Bale spent months weight training for the role and looks great, but in
the context of the story, his body appears less like that of a sexually
attractive male and more like a well-designed android. Despite his
constant grooming and preening, Patrick Bateman is just an anonymous
capitalist, so indistinguishable from his Wall Street peers that he is
often mistaken for another of the corporate boys.
Boys, by the way, is the operative word. These arrested adolescents
define themselves totally by their clothing and acquisitions. Instead of
comparing penises, they whip out their business cards to determine whose
is the most tastefully extravagant.
Of course, attacking materialists for being shallow is about as daring
as calling politicians dishonorable, but Bateman's personal life does
provide some twisted fun. He does crunches while watching "The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre." He peppers his conversations with serial killer
references and drops hints about his homicidal leanings (asked what he
does for a living, he glibly says "murders and executions," which his
companion hears as "mergers and acquisitions").
During foreplay, he gives impassioned lectures about his favorite pop
artists. Particularly enjoyable are his inane comments on Huey Lewis.
Bateman states that the homogenized popster's early works were "too New
Wave" for his tastes and describes one of whiter-than-white Huey's songs
as "too black sounding." He also rhapsodizes about Whitney Houston and
Phil Collins, going so far as to play Collins' infamous "Sussudio," one
of the most wretched songs ever recorded, while having sex.
Incidentally, that sex scene, which shows Bateman gazing adoringly in
the mirror at his muscles as he makes it with two women, was the only
segment that had to be edited to satisfy the prudes in the MPAA. To
avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating, a couple of thrusting motions had to be
cut out (Harron intends to put them back in when the film hits DVD).
After a round in the sack, Bateman likes to cap things off by hacking up
his partner. The film's most memorable stretch has him chasing a hooker
through the halls of his apartment building (a la "The Shining") while
hoisting a chain saw in front of his nude form like some mega-phallus.
Not exactly subtle, but it works.
If, like me, you grow weary of "American Psycho's" repetitious narration
and lack of plot, try entertaining yourself by deciding (WARNING:
POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD) whether the murders are real or figments of
Bateman's imagination. A case can be made either way, although oddities
in a number of scenes, coupled with a wildly surrealistic finale, point
strongly to the latter. I prefer the it's-all-in-his-head scenario;
serial killer movies are a dime a dozen, but the idea of a nicely
mannered co-worker smiling and nodding while quietly fantasizing about
hacking me to pieces is chilling (END SPOILER ALERT).
When I give even a qualified positive review to a film like "American
Psycho," I inevitably receive a handful of letters from readers furious
that I "lured" them into wasting their money on "a parade of utter
crap." As a preemptive strike, I wish to clearly state that "American
Psycho" is a difficult movie. D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T. If you generally prefer
mainstream fare, there's a good chance you will not enjoy yourself. Got
it? Good.

In preparation for his role in "The Skulls," actor Joshua Jackson
researched the real Yale University secret society, the Skull & Bones,
which served as model for the one portrayed in the thriller. He spoke
with Entertainment Weekly Online about the group, whose roster includes
former presidents William H. Taft and George Bush, as well as current
candidate George W. Bush, and their kinky hazing rituals. Reportedly, an
inductee "proves his worth" by getting shot up with Sodium Pentothal
("truth serum"), lying naked with another potential member for a round
of "Liar's Hell" (a prolonged game of "Truth"), and  get this 
masturbating in a coffin. "If George W. becomes president, I won't be
able to look at him without laughing," said Jackson. "I mean, c'mon, he
was wankin' in a coffin at Yale."
With such freaky background material, it would be reasonable to expect
lots of lurid fun from "The Skulls," but instead we get the kind of
dreary, half-hearted crap that the USA Network routinely palms off as
made-for-TV movies.
Jackson, best known as Pacey from "Dawson's Creek," plays Luke McNamara,
a blue collar kid struggling financially to stay in Ya-- well, they
never actually call it Yale, although you can occasionally spot large
"Y's" prominently affixed in the background. Luke's longtime townie pals
now view him as uppity, so he hangs out with two campus buddies;
crusading writer Will (Hill Harper) and plucky potential girlfriend
Chloe (Leslie Bibb).
Soon enough, Luke receives a cryptic invitation from the Skulls. Despite
warnings from Will about the dangers of shadow organizations ("if it's
secret and powerful, it can't be good"), Luke eagerly follows
instructions and gets drugged into unconsciousness, waking up in a
coffin (presumably, he was too groggy to do any wankin') on a
hilariously phony gothic set covered with other coffin-encased wannabe
Skulls.
With spotlights swooping everywhere (the Skulls are real drama queens),
Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson), leader of the group, strides
into the chamber to lay down the law. Each member of the society is
paired with a fellow inductee who will be his "soul mate," offering
emotional support and counsel for life. The Skulls operate from an
exhaustive rule book that covers any possible situation. "Our rules
supersede all others," Litten intones as his soul mate, Senator Ames
Levitt (William Peterson), looks on from the distance. Luke learns that
his soul mate is none other than Litten's pretty boy son, Caleb (Paul
Walker).
Life immediately changes for Luke, as the society deposits thousands in
his bank account, presents him and the other new kids with bright, shiny
sports cars (for a secret society, the Skulls sure are flashy) and hold
grand dinners where dessert is a bevy of glamorous whores.
The party ends when Will turns up dead and Luke uncovers evidence that a
Skull is responsible. The group deems him a threat, leading to the
requisite chases, confrontations, yadda yadda. No cliché is left unused
as the film slogs its way towards a grand finale featuring a good
old-fashioned duel!
Every moment of "The Skulls" is just as idiotic as it sounds. Had the
film explored the concept of secret societies, from the dynamics of the
power structure to the eroticism that lies beneath the rituals and that
"soul mate" business, this could have been interesting. Instead,
director Rob Cohen is satisfied to present a painfully routine movie
that grows sillier with each passing minute. The only mystery in "The
Skulls" is why actors of Craig T. Nelson's caliber agreed to
participate. Surely, the residuals he earns from "Coach" are big enough
that he can afford to pass on garbage like this.

Review for Dark City (1998)
Dark City (1998)
Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, Richard O'Brien, Ian 
Richardson, William Hurt. Directed by Alex Proyas. 104 minutes.
Rated R, 3.5 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

What if you aren't who you think you are? What if your memories are 
manufactured? What if otherworldly beings slip into your mind while you 
sleep, changing your identity as casually as one changes TV stations? 
That's the premise of Alex Proyas' striking new sci-fi noir thriller. He 
calls it "Dark City." Mental health professionals might call it "Paranoia 
Helper." 
Using extremely quick edits, sensuous computer graphics, and a palette of 
blacks, browns and blues, with an occasional splash of red, Proyas ("The 
Crow") puts you smack in the middle of a nightmare from which you cannot 
awake. The story employs a fractured dream logic, although attentive 
viewers will have no problem following the narrative flow. 
You could spend hours listing all the film's reference points.  "Brazil," 
"Blade Runner," "Altered States," "Metropolis," "Twin Peaks," and "The 
Prisoner" spring to mind, but there are many other touch points. The 
bottom line, though, is that Proyas has crafted a vision distinctly his 
own. "Dark City" has an amazingly rich texture and an extraordinary sense 
of place. Even as the buildings themselves twist from one shape to 
another, you feel as if you could walk down their desolate halls. Despite 
periodic lapses into cheesiness, "Dark City" is memorable filmmaking, 
more an experience than simply a movie.  
It begins when John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in the bathtub of a 
seedy hotel suite. There's a dead prostitute in the room, but he can't 
remember if he killed her. For that matter, he can't remember anything 
about his past. While desperately trying to collect himself, Murdoch 
receives a call from a Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland,) urging him to 
flee the room immediately. In short order, Murdoch learns that a lot of 
people are looking for him. Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) wants 
him in connection with a string of vicious murders. His wife Emma 
(Jennifer Connelly) wants to make amends for cheating on him. And the 
Strangers want him very badly. Bedecked in long overcoats as they 
silently fly through the night skies, the pallid bald pursuers look like 
the hellish spawn of Uncle Fester and Pinhead, filtered through a 
Magritte painting.
So who are the Strangers and what are they up to? It would be best to 
find out during the course of the story, but since Proyas spills the 
beans in an unnecessary voice-over at the beginning of the film, I'll 
recount them here. The Strangers are the last of an alien race, 
conducting experiments on humanity from their headquarters deep beneath 
the city. Possessed of a power called "tuning," they can stop time, make 
people fall asleep with the wave of a hand, and reshape physical reality 
through concentration alone. At the stroke of twelve every night (and 
it's always night,) they implant memories and identities in various 
citizens, then carefully watch the results.
But sometimes the implants don't go quite right, as evidenced by Murdoch. 
Further complicating the Strangers' agenda is the fact that Murdoch is 
also able to tune. Gradually, Murdoch changes from panicked victim to 
avenging warrior as he pursues vague memories of an idyllic place called 
Shell Beach, all while honing his newfound powers. Clearly it's just a 
matter of time before he confronts the aliens and dares them to "Go ahead,
 make my night."
Rufus Sewell handles Murdoch well, investing the character with just the 
right amounts of urgency and strength. Hurt and Connelly turn in sturdy 
enough performances, given the befuddled nature required of their 
characters. Richard O'Brien, who created "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" 
and played Riff-Raff, gives a stylish turn as Mr. Hand, lead hatchet man 
for the Strangers.
The oddest performance comes from Kiefer Sutherland, affecting a bizarre, 
quasi-Peter Lorre impression as Dr. Schreber. Sutherland says two...or 
three...words then he...pauses and...breathes then he...continues 
speaking. The halting, breathy speech style is just as annoying onscreen 
as it was in that sentence.
Performances and plot aside, "Dark City" is a feast for the eyes. The 
city has the worn look of New York in the 40s or 50s, with retro 
funkiness and art deco flourishes everywhere. Computer animated shots of 
the buildings morphing from one shape to another are dazzling, as are the 
scenes of the Strangers gliding through the air. The effects are 
occassionally cheesy, particularly when Murdoch has a literal battle of 
wills with head Stranger Mr. Book (Ian Richardson,) but with a vision as 
expansive as Proyas', the flubs are easy to overlook.
With it's roots firmly in the "Heavy Metal" school of adolescent 
trippiness, "Dark City" makes no groundbreaking statements, but that's 
fine. Proyas has taken a clever idea, added some phenomenal imagery and 
created one whale of an apocalyptic dreamscape. During a season where 
most movies look like photocopies of each other, "Dark City" is a most 
welcome diversion. 

Title
Review for Men in Black (1997)
As I walked towards the exit after the sneak preview of "Men In Black", I 
bumped into a buddy of mine. We stood in the aisle with big, dumb grins 
on our faces, like giddy children, gushing praise over the utterly 
delightful film we'd just experienced. After suffering through weeks of 
one summer mega-dud after another, it was exhilarating to finally see a 
movie that paid-off as richly as this one did. Not only were we eager to 
see "MiB" again as soon as possible, we actually found ourselves talking 
about how cool the SEQUEL would be.
"MiB" is a smart, breezy, very funny amalgam of "Ghostbusters" and "The X-
Files", with a little "Pulp Fiction" and "Dragnet" thrown in to boot. The 
premise is simple. For decades, aliens have been using our backwater 
little planet as an intergalactic getaway; a nice spot for a fresh start 
and a good place to hide. "Ever see the movie Casablanca?'", says Agent 
K (Tommy Lee Jones), "We're sort of the same thing, only without Nazis." 
K is one of the MiB, super-secret government agents in charge of all 
activities related to the immigration and policing of extraterrestrials. 
When K's partner decides to retire, a group of men are recruited as 
possible replacements. One member of the group, a brash young New York 
cop (Will Smith), emerges as the clear stand-out and, in short order, 
becomes K's new partner, J. 
What makes "MiB" so hilarious is the remarkably deadpan, matter-of-fact 
tone of the ultra-smooth agents. K, his boss Zed (Rip Torn), and the 
other MiB deal with the incredibly bizarre goings-on without ever raising 
an eyebrow. Dressed in black suits, white shirts and Ray Bans, these guys 
are the epitome of retro-cool. Saving the world from giant insect-like 
psychoshey, it's just part of a day's work.
The aliens live among us, by the way. You know those particularly odd 
people you encounter, the ones who seem a little too weird to be real? 
Well, according to "MiB", they're not. Those folks are aliens 
masquerading as humans, trying to get a feel for their new forms. As the 
MiB monitors reveal, many of our more "unique" well-known citizens are 
actually aliens in disguise. This theory, incidentally, could go a long 
way towards explaining Regis and Kathy Lee.
The aliens in "MiB" are amazing to behold; wonderfully imaginative 
creatures that blend seamlessly with the live performers. But this is one 
movie where dazzling special effects don't outshine the actors. Bug-eyed 
monsters be damned, this show belongs to Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. 
Smith is an beguiling Everyman, with style and attitude to spare, but 
Tommy Lee Jones steals the picture in one of the best performances of his 
career. His craggy features and steely expression make the outrageous 
seem normal. His droll, laconic delivery is absolutely dead-on. But 
beneath his Ray Bans are the eyes of a man who has suffered. The 
sacrifice K made when he dedicated his life to MiB weighs heavy on his 
spirit and Jones has wistful, reflective moments that one rarely sees in 
this sort of rollicking comedy. Jones is both the anchor and the heart of 
the film.
Sharp direction from Barry Sonnenfeld ("Get Shorty") and crisp, tight 
editing result in a movie that races by, clocking in at an efficient 97 
minutes. What a relief to see a summer blockbuster that understands the 
old adage "less is more". 
"MiB" is not without flaws. After a spectacular beginning, the film sags 
just a bit in the middle section, as K & J's investigation of an 
rampaging alien becomes a little too down to earth. A subplot involving 
Linda Fiorentino as an insightful and sexually assertive medical examiner 
is underdeveloped and, at the end of the film, Will Smith's J still seems 
too inexperienced for the huge responsibilities thrust upon him. 
These are minor quibbles, though. The bottom line is that "MiB" is an 
absolute hoot, a fully realized sci-fi detective comedy with a sublime 
sense of cool. Other movies, notably "Mars Attacks!" and "The Adventures 
Of Buckaroo Banzai", have captured this ironic-hip sensibility, but lost 
the mainstream audience along the way. "MiB" should not suffer their fate.
 With its little green flippers firmly on the pulse of the public's 
tastes, "MiB" should easily become one of the years biggest hits. What's 
even better, it deserves to be.

After seeing this film, I think I understand why disco died. Everybody 
was so busy yapping that they simply forgot to dance. At least that's the 
way it seems in "The Last Days of Disco," Whit Stillman's entertaining 
film about a group of dreadful people. While the satire features a 
talented cast maneuvering through a perfunctory storyline and romantic 
subplots, the real star here is the English language. Stillman is 
intoxicated with words and the film overflows with urbane conversations. 
His characters talk about social manners. They talk about the politics of 
dating. They talk about group dynamics, the origins of environmentalism 
and Disney's role in reinforcing stereotypical male and female behavior. 
They talk and talk and talk until you want to scream "For the love of God,
 would you people just shut up and dance!?!" 
With "Metropolitan" and "Barcelona," "The Last Days of Disco" completes a 
trilogy of Stillman films containing many of the same characters. Set 
against the world of disco in the early 80's, the production focuses on a 
handful of horrible young adults. Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte 
(Kate Beckinsale) are co-workers at a publishing house. The pair spend 
their evenings at a glittery disco packed with extras dressed in colorful 
outfits. Doormen stand guard at the exclusive club, admitting only people 
with the "right" look and social status. The disco is the center of Alice 
and Charlotte's lives and they never venture to other nightclubs. Perhaps 
that's because this is the only disco on Earth that plays its music 
quietly enough to allow casual conversation.
Charlotte, the consummate bitch, spews an endless stream of offhand 
nasty remarks to her "friend." With a reassuring touch to the forearm, 
she tells Alice "In physical terms I'm cuter than you." In front of a 
group, she mulls over why Alice isn't drinking that evening, sorts it out,
 then cheerfully announces "Oh, I get it. It's because of that medication 
you're taking. You've got gonorrhea!" Later, she apologizes for her 
"compulsive honesty," while opining that getting VD can be a plus, 
because notifying your past partners is a great excuse to renew relations 
with old boyfriends. 
Charlotte isn't the only gem in this tiara of humanity. There's junior 
club manager Des (Christopher Eigeman), who dumps girlfriends by 
"discovering" that he's gay (he explains that his moment of realization 
came when he noticed his unusual attraction to Marlon Perkin's assistant 
in "Wild Kingdom"), advertising executive Jimmy (MacKenzie Astin), who 
ferrets clients into the club by wearing Wizard of Oz costumes, and Tom 
(Robert Sean Leonard), an activist who theorizes that the modern 
environmental movement began when thousands of baby boomers were 
simultaneously traumatized by the death of Bambi's mother. And let's not 
forget Josh (Matthew Keeslar), a manic-depressive assistant DA who, when 
not furtively investigating the club's finances, waxes rhapsodic about 
the disco "movement" ("something this big and important will never really 
die," he says unconvincingly). 
In-between conversations, they...wait, that's wrong, these people are 
never in-between conversations. DURING conversations, they date each 
other, break up and make up, and have periodic ugly confrontations with 
the outside world. Despite the almost total lack of action, the film is 
engaging and often funny. One of the highlights is a deep group 
discussion about Josh's deconstructionist theory that Disney's "Lady and 
the Tramp" was designed to "program women to adore jerks."
Unfortunately, the characters are so incredibly annoying that it becomes 
difficult to appreciate the humor, as the urge to belt these pretentious, 
self-absorbed idiots grows stronger and stronger. These are stagnant 
people. They accomplish nothing, they do nothing except dissect life's 
minutia while celebrating their own mediocrity. While their vapidity may 
be the core of Stillman's satire of the social mores of the period, it 
doesn't make it any easier to watch. Thank goodness for the "Love Train" 
sequence that ends the film. I won't spoil things by describing it here, 
but the scene is both funny and lyrical, breaking the inertia that weighs 
down the rest of the film. How odd that a movie set in a disco suffers 
from lack of movement.
In an ideal world, Whit Stillman would have got together with "Godzilla" 
creators Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich and combined their character-
deficient movie with his. By blending both films into one, they could 
have created a stunning fusion, an event film with brains. Think about it.
 A giant lizard attacks Manhattan during the disco days. While the 
military battles the creature, Whitman's characters wander the New York 
streets prattling endlessly, oblivious to everything except the sound of 
their own voices. Then, just before the final battle scene, Godzilla 
takes a surprise step and squishes the entire cast of "The Last Days of 
Disco." Now that would be a five star movie.

Review for Everest (1998)
Everest (1998)
Narrated by Liam Neeson. Directed and produced by Greg MacGillivray, 
David Breashears and Stephen Judson. 40 minutes.
NR, 4 stars (out of five stars)

After a while, you come to expect spectacular visuals from IMAX 
documentaries. Sweeping shots of glorious vistas have become the norm for 
works created using the giant scale film format. All too often though, 
the human element ends up lacking. In many IMAX documentaries, we watch 
nature at its most majestic and humanity at its most distant. Consider 
"Everest" the exception to the rule. Despite the awesome footage of the 
29,028 foot mountain, where the snow blows straight up, temperatures drop 
to 100 degrees below zero and avalanches are as routine as the sunset, 
it's the human story that packs the most punch here. Far more than a 
grand travelogue, "Everest" quite literally is a story of life and death.
When mountaineer and Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Breashears agreed 
to document the ascent to the top of the world, he knew he had signed on 
for a logistic nightmare. A standard IMAX camera weighs 80 pounds and a 
single 500 foot roll of large format film, which can only capture 90 
seconds of action, weighs an additional five pounds. Breashears worked 
with engineers to create a specially-modified camera weighing only 35 
pounds, designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of the mountain. 
Even with the modifications, the process was still daunting. For example, 
tests showed that the cameras could not be loaded while wearing gloves, 
quite a problem for technicians at 20 below zero.
After a great deal of testing, the equipment was deemed suitable and in 
May 1996, the expedition began. Then, on May 10th, tragedy struck when 23 
climbers in a seperate expedition were caught in a horrific white-out 
that claimed several lives, including two of the group's leaders. 
Suddenly, the IMAX team found themselves documenting a tragedy, along 
with their own stirring rescue of one of the survivors, who stumbled into 
the IMAX group's camp suffering severe frostbite to his extremities. 
The subsequent footage is both nightmarish and absolutely riveting. In 
one scene, a man calls his wife in New Zealand, naming their unborn child 
shortly before freezing to death. The film allows the viewer to get to 
know the IMAX climbers, making their emotional comments on the tragedy 
before them all the more devastating. Narrated by actor Liam Neeson, 
Breashears' film captures the dazzling visuals one expects from an IMAX 
production; colorful prayer wheels spinning in Katmandu before the 
mission begins, a team member 
carefully traversing a ladder perilously balanced over a bottomless chasm,
 climbers dangling over massive cliffs of ice, and the sheer grandeur of 
the mountain itself. But ultimately, it's the story of the climbers and 
their impractical, dangerous, amazing quest to achieve that lingers long 
after you leave the theater. 
Humans are impossibly foolish creatures, and our remarkable ability to 
set 
unrealistic goals, coupled with the resolve to make those goals happen 
despite all odds, allows us to occassionally reach the heights of glory. 
"Everest," the finest IMAX documentary to date, captures all of that, 
along with a portrait of nature at its most awe-inspiring.

Three things I learned from "Being John Malkovich": when getting on
the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a
building, always bring your crowbar; don't stand in the way of your
wife's actualization as a man; and, whenever entering a portal into
the mind of another human being, wear old clothes, because, hey, it's
muddy in there.
"Being John Malkovich" is the most original film to come down the pike
in a very long time. Wildly surrealistic, yet presented in a
down-to-earth, funky style, this is the kind of movie that sticks in
your head. After savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline,
you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it. From the
ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature
of identity itself, there's a lot to think about here.
Just don't forget to have fun. Clearly, all parties involved in the
making of the film certainly did, starting with writer Charles
Kaufman. "I wrote 'Being John Malkovich' without an outline," he
explains in the press notes, "blindly, with no sense of direction or
purpose. It's important to me that I don't have a map before I
start. This allows me to surprise myself, stay engaged, discover
things, and, hopefully, allow the unconscious to surface."
Spike Jonze (Mark Wahlberg's naďve buddy in "Three Kings") takes it
from there. The white-hot director of the Beastie Boy's "Sabotage," an
award-winning parody of '70s TV cop shows, as well as numerous other
music videos and commercials, eschews typical MTV flash for his
feature film debut. Jonze wisely realized that a storyline this
unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style. His flat,
matter-of-fact approach works perfectly.
And then there's the cast. John Cusack plays control freak Craig
Schwartz, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents
objecting to his remarkably expressive, but decidedly erotic puppet
shows. Over the years, his marriage to obsessive pet store employee
Lotte (Cameron Diaz) has devolved. Once passionate lovers, the two are
now little more than courteous roommates.
Financially strapped, Craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk
at LesterCorp, located on the 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan
Building. Navigating around Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), his 105 year-old
boss and Floris (Mary Kay Place), Lester's dotty secretary, Craig
tries to settle into his new position, but two things keep him
distracted. First, there's the beautiful and imperious Maxine
(Catherine Keener), who delights in tormenting Craig over his obvious
lust for her. And then there's the hole behind the file cabinet, which
turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich. Craig
learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the
subconscious of Malkovich, where they can experience life from his
point of view (with enough concentration, you can even influence his
actions). After 15 minutes, the visitor gets ejected and
unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the New Jersey
turnpike.
By the way, if you're concerned that I gave away too much of the plot,
rest assured - - I barely scratched the surface. One of the most
satisfying aspects of the fable is that Kaufman is not content to
simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up. Instead, he crawls into
the dark premise as completely as Craig crawls into Malkovich,
rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical
implications of compromising another person's identity. He also
examines the consequences of the Malko-visits to Craig, Lotte, Maxine
and, of course, John Malkovich himself.
The performances are superb. Malkovich (best known to mainstream
audiences for his work in "Dangerous Liaisons," "In the Line of Fire,"
and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure "Con Air") tweaks his
own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn. Far from his effete,
vaguely reptilian persona, this Malkovich is just another schlub,
drinking with his pals and trying to get laid (incidentally, Charlie
Sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad
boy reputation).
As always, John Cusack nails his part, handily pulling viewers along
even as Craig's actions become unconscionable. The big surprises come
from Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, both playing against
type. Kenner, usually cast in icy subordinate roles, is terrific as a
highly intelligent, extremely manipulative femme fatale. Cameron Diaz,
barely recognizable under a mess of brown, curly hair, sheds her
perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into
extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in Malkovich.
"Being John Malkovich" stumbles towards the end, as Jonze and Kaufman
try too hard to resolve the various subplots. Additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered
finale. Regardless, this contemporary "Alice in Wonderland" is a real
treat. I enjoyed watching "Being John Malkovich," but only later,
after reflecting on the film, did its resonance fully hit me. At one
point, Craig says, "Do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this
portal is?" Truer words were never spoken.

At one point in "My Dog Skip," the narrator states that his beloved pet
appeared to be "possessed of a wisdom as old as time itself." A wisdom
as old as time itself? Excuse me, but aren't we talking about an animal
known for licking its balls (not that there's anything wrong with that)
and eating poo? Hey, if Skip is so damn smart, why didn't he write his
own life story? The lack of opposable thumbs may have been a factor, but
I suspect the main reason was because the pooch was busy learning to
balance just right so that he could drink out of the toilet.
"My Dog Skip" is a classic example of Hollywood overkill. Based on
Willie Morris' memoir of growing up in Yazoo City, Mississippi during
World War II, the film takes a series of nostalgic vignettes and trusses
them up in schmaltzy music and overwrought drama. As if that wasn't
enough, we must suffer though a cheesy voice-over narrative that adds
absolutely nothing to the production, although it does occasionally
provide a few unintended laughs.
For example, as we watch the dog trotting through various neighborhoods
in the segregated town, the narrator informs us that Skip was
"colorblind" and above the overt racism of the era. Oh, give me a break.
He was foraging for food, pure and simple. Taking a dog that views his
town as a giant buffet and painting him as a four-legged ambassador for
the Rainbow Coalition is just plain stupid.
There is a nice little "boy and his dog" story beneath all the bullshit,
anchored by two appealing performers. "Malcolm in the Middle" star
Frankie Muniz plays Willie Morris and the young actor is as unaffected
and genuine here as he is on TV. Moose, the terrier best known as Eddie
on "Frasier," is one of several dogs portraying the adorable Skip.
Together, they serve as a welcome antidote to the more turgid elements
of the production.
What's odd and annoying about "My Dog Skip" is how the filmmakers take a
can't-miss premise and gunk it up. As anyone who has ever seen "Frasier"
will attest, Moose can do every trick in the book. That's all well and
good, but the mixture of bittersweet realism and a dog who is more
physically adroit than most of the cast members doesn't really gel. It's
hard to focus on painful truths when poochie is leaping around like one
of the Flying Wallendas.
Most of the pathos, incidentally, is not contained in Morris' book. A
subplot about Willie's next door neighbor, Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), a
popular jock disgraced during his military service, is made up, as is
the business about Willie's father, Jack (Kevin Bacon), being embittered
over losing a leg in the Spanish Civil War.
While the period details are dead on, attempts to make everything look
like an animated Norman Rockwell painting get a bit strained, with most
of the children resembling extras from an "Our Gang" comedy. Check out
the smallest of the three neighborhood bullies in the film. The powers
that be decided he would look cuter, or more authentic, or something,
with dirt on his face, so the poor kid spends the entire movie with
various smudges around his mouth, while his pals remain relatively
clean. Weird. Very weird.
But the most maddening part of the film is unquestionably the narrative.
In the weighty observations of the full-grown Willie (Harry Connick
Jr.), everything is poignant and each incident marks another step in his
ridiculously measured coming of age. "At that moment I stopped being a
child and became a boy," he intones. What? At the moment I heard that, I
stopped being a critic and became an irritated man checking his watch.
Despite its many problems, I still enjoyed "My Dog Skip," thanks almost
completely to the considerable charm of Frankie Muniz and the various
canines playing Skip. But oh, how much better this film could have been
if Gail Gilchriest, the writer who adapted Morris' memoir, had shown up
for work and said, "Folks, I'm afraid we're going to have to stick to
the book after all. Why? Well, because my dog ate the screenplay."

The swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into
"Heartbreakers." Ray Liotta's character was making out with his
secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office. While
scrambling to collect himself, he frantically shouted to her, "Just wait
a sex  er, I mean sec!"
I was struck by a wave of revulsion, thinking, "Geez, didn't lines like
that die when 'Three's Company' was canceled?" Over the next few
minutes, as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots
grew more numerous, I realized that the mindset behind "Heartbreakers"
predated "Three's Company." Suddenly, I had an out-of-body experience as
my internal Way-Back machine swept me to the mid-1960s. All across
America, the counter-culture was growing like wildfire, but there was
scant evidence of it on TV. While young people were challenging
traditional values on the streets, frustrated teenagers like me were
stuck at home, sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest Bob Hope
special. Women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while Hope
made growling noises and leered at their breasts. On another channel,
Dean Martin made wisecracks about "booze and broads" and Peter Lawford,
decked out in love beads and a Nehru jacket, purred suggestive
one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers.
"Heartbreakers" reeks of that stagnant mentality, from its lingering
shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden
screenplay, which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling
buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated. In
addition to Liotta and Hewitt, the cast includes Sigourney Weaver, Gene
Hackman, Jason Lee, Nora Dunn and Anne Bancroft. I can't imagine what
drew performers of their caliber to this project. Perhaps they thought
it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s. If so, they
were sadly mistaken.
The story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team. It opens with the
marriage of Max (Weaver) to Dean (Liotta), a New Jersey chop shop
operator. Having withheld sex until the honeymoon, Max pretends to pass
out on their wedding night. The next morning, she feigns illness,
sending a very horny Dean off to the office, where he ends up in the
arms of his new secretary. Just as the two are about to get overtly
physical, Max bursts into the room and catches them. The "horrified"
bride dissolves the union, garnering a healthy cash settlement along the
way. Of course, the secretary was really her daughter Page (Hewitt) and
the whole thing was a set-up.
The women move on, but an IRS agent (Bancroft) catches up with them and
demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes. In desperate need
of funds, Max and Page head for Palm Beach to replay the scam. Their
mark this time is William B. Tensy (Hackman, in hideous make-up), a
decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking. Max starts to
put the game into action, but Page is so repelled by the old man (and
angry with her mom) that she slips off to enact her own score, targeting
Jack, a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune.
Complications arise when Page realizes that good-natured Jack is
stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart. As if that wasn't
enough, Dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind.
The attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind
me of the infinitely superior "A Fish Called Wanda." I won't bother to
compare the two. Suffice to say that everything done right in "Wanda" is
done wrong here. "Heartbreakers" is soulless, inept and, at 123 minutes,
at least a half-hour too long. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt
throw themselves into their parts, but have nowhere to go with the
metallic characters. Gene Hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note,
one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking, coughing and
waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex. Poor Jason Lee is stuck in the
ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely
bland. Ray Liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor
into his walking cliché, but only a bit.
The low point in the film has Weaver employing a Russian accent bad
enough to make Boris and Natasha wince, while doing half-assed slapstick
with a broken off penis from a statue. Bear in mind, though, that this
is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low
points. If you remember Bob Hope specials with fondness, this might be
your cup of tea. As for me, I'm going to watch "A Fish Called Wanda" now
and try to forget I ever saw "Heartbreakers."

In 1998, Indianapolis filmmaker Tommy O'Haver became a hot commodity
with his debut feature, "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss," a sweet,
wonderfully imaginative and beautifully shot production. When I
interviewed O'Haver, he was hard at work on a big screen adaptation of
the beloved comic book, "Archie." "I'm rewriting the script and will be
directing the film" O'Haver told me in '98. "I wrote the first draft as
well. It's going to stay very true to the comic book. It's going to be
like a live action comic and will be hip in its aesthetic. And yet these
characters are going to be ultra-pure and squeaky clean, but there's
going to be so much drama going on in their romantic lives that I hope
people won't hold that against them. It's going to have dream sequences
and musical numbers, some good catfights between Betty and Veronica."
Alas, the movie was not to be. The studio executives changed their minds
and the highly anticipated "Archie" ended up shelved. But O'Haver was
not to be denied. For his second feature, the young director has taken a
thoroughly ordinary teen romantic comedy and added his distinctive
touches, making "Get Over It" more engaging than most offerings in this
tired genre. We may never see O'Havers' take on "Archie," but the
stylistic flourishes here give us a good idea of what it might have been
like. I don't want to oversell this production, so let me stress that
"Get Over It" is no jewel. The script is only intermittently funny, good
ideas are underdeveloped, most of the characters are barely even
one-dimensional and the lead couple has no chemistry together. Still,
I'm glad I saw it, thanks almost completely to Tommy O'Haver.
Set in Anytown, USA, the story introduces high school senior Berke
Landers (Ben Foster), who was just dumped by Allison McAllister (Melissa
Sagemiller). The pain of rejection heightens when Allison starts dating
Bentley "Striker" Scrumfeld (Shane West), a smirking Brit from the 'N
Sync-ish boy band Smalltown Lads (we get a brief look at the video for
their hit, "Luv S.C.U.D.").
When Berke learns that Allison and Striker plan to audition for the
school's spring musical, a "hip" take on Shakespeare titled, "A
Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve," the lovesick teen ignores the advice of
his friends Felix (Colin Hanks) and Dennis (Sisqo) and sets out to join
the production. Berke is tone deaf, but luckily, Felix's sister,
aspiring singer-songwriter Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), offers to coach him.
Will there be tense moments between Berke and Striker? Will there be a
big party where something disgusting happens? Will the drama teacher
turn out to be a dictatorial queen? And will romance finally spark
between Berke and Kelly? Anyone who has ever attended a teen comedy
knows the answer to these questions. Happily, O'Haver brightens up the
generic journey with some inspired touches. For instance, when the
just-rejected Berke trudges away from Allison's house at the beginning
of the movie, a production number breaks out behind him, with a garage
band lip-synching to "Love Will Keep Us Together" while trash collectors
and delivery men break into dance.
There are more treats, particularly during the latter part of the movie,
when the school musical shifts into high gear. Martin Short plays drama
teacher Dr. Desmond Forrest-Oates as a cross between Andy Dick and Fred
Willard, tossing off lines like, "I remember what the great Robert De
Niro once said to me well, not to me, but I read it in an article."
Short clearly has a field day throwing tantrums in the kiddy pool and,
clichéd though his character may be, he is fun to watch.
The other adult characters in the cast are kind and understanding to an
absurd degree, from the coach who tells a tardy player, "You are so
lucky I'm not Bobby Knight," to Berke's parents, played by Swoosie Kurtz
and Ed Begley Jr., who host an extremely lurid TV relationship show
called "Love Matters."
Along with the pleasant surprises comes the requisite teen comedy
gross-out bits. Viewers are treated to a pet pooch that humps anything
and a drunken partygoer that barfs into a bowl of punch. O'Haver
presents these scenes in a pedestrian manner, getting them over with as
quickly as possible so he can focus on what he really wants to do.
The young cast is serviceable, doing what they can with their one-note
roles. Only Kirsten Dunst comes off as an actual human being in this sea
of lightly sketched cartoons. But the real star of this movie is Tommy
O'Haver; who takes a lousy teen comedy and manages to spin it into a
mildly entertaining feature. Even with his efforts, "Get Over It" is as
insubstantial as meringue, but at least it's a tasty meringue.

Doctor Dolittle should have become a proctologist. Then he'd have 
been better prepared for the unrelenting onslaught of scatological humor 
in this crappy comedy. There's nothing wrong with a gross-out 
joke and "Doctor Dolittle" has quite a few funny ones, but the film's 
unrelenting barrage of butt, rectal and poop humor quickly becomes 
tiresome, and eventually flat-out annoying. Is this really the best these 
guys could do with the concept?
Related to Hugh Lofting's children stories and the 1967 Rex Harrison 
film in name only, this "Doctor Dolittle" begins with a pup (Ellen 
Degeneres) explaining to young John Dolittle that dogs sniff each others 
rears as a way of saying hello. When the boy emulates the behavior and 
takes a whiff of the new minister's ass, it's off to the pound for Ellen, 
while John's father (Ozzie Davis) calls in an exorcist to rid the boy of 
his ability to talk to the animals.
Cut to the present, where the adult John (Eddie Murphy) is a successful 
doctor so caught up in his work that he neglects his family. Although his 
partners are excited that their thriving practice is about to be snapped 
up by an HMO, John has lost his enthusiasm for practicing medicine. 
Things change when he whacks his head in an auto mishap and his gift 
returns. To his amazement, John hears the dog he struck call him 
"bonehead." 
Of course, John and Lucky (Norm Macdonald), the recovering mutt, 
become pals. Soon after, the doc treats a wounded owl and word spreads 
through the animal kingdom about the doctor who can talk with the animals.
 John adjusts to the situation and finds his love of healing renewed, 
although his co-workers and family fear he's lost his mind. 
That's certainly a sturdy enough framework for a comedy, had the writers 
stretched their imaginations a bit. If you take a couple minutes right 
now, I guarantee you'll come up with at least a dozen gags more inventive 
than those that appear in this film. After viewing "Doctor Dolittle," 
it's easy to imagine the producers strapping writers Nat Mauldin and 
Larry Levin in chairs facing a wall covered with photos of various 
animals' posteriors and saying "Create!" From pigeon poop gags to a long 
scene involving the retrieval of a thermometer from Lucky's rectum, it's 
obvious that Mauldin and Levin spent considerable time sniffing butts in 
preparation for their work.
Despite the repetitive theme, a number of the jokes are funny and several 
of the actor's providing the animal voices do fine work. Norm 
Macdonald is quite likable as the sarcastic Lucky. If only he had been 
this engaging in "Dirty Work," his own recent comedy misfire. Garry 
Shandling and Julie Kavner are funny as squabbling pigeons and 
Albert Brooks contributes a sympathetic performance as a sick tiger. 
Look for quick, but cute, voice work from Paul Reubens as a raccoon, 
and Gilbert Gottfried as an obsessive-compulsive dog. On the other side 
of the coin, Chris Rock is just loud and irritating as a guinea pig with 
attitude.
And then there's Eddie Murphy. In a lapse of judgment more annoying 
than the potty-humor fixation, Murphy is cast in a role where he has 
little to do but react, wasting the actor's comedic skills. Noticing that 
their star has nothing to do, the desperate writers insert a mawkish 
subplot in order to give Eddie the chance to deliver a heartfelt speech 
or two. It doesn't help.
Despite a few good scenes, "Doctor Dolittle" is a drag, a phenomenal 
waste of a good concept and a talented actor. How did such a misfire 
occur? My theory is that someone told the writers that they should 
create a film like "that charming comedy about a pig." Then, in doing 
research, they made the fatal mistake of studying "Porky's" instead of 
"Babe."

Halloween is coming up and if you're in the mood for an old fashioned,
Grade B thriller, "Joy Ride" may be right up your alley. The production
makes some mistakes, but manages to establish and maintain a palpable
sense of menace by tapping into areas of primal fear. You know that
vague discomfort you feel while driving in the middle of nowhere late at
night? "Joy Ride" plops you into that setting, then ups the fear factor
by adding an anonymous figure, one that cannot be reasoned with, whose
only goal is to get his hands on you.
Here's the set-up. Lewis (Paul Walker) is a college student who dreams
of turning his relationship with Venna (Leelee Sobieski) from platonic
to romantic. To that end, he agrees to pick her up from her school in a
different city, looking forward to a road trip with the girl of his
dreams. Just as he is leaving, he learns that his older brother, Fuller
(Steve Zahn), is in jail. Despite being leery over his seemingly
incorrigible sibling, Lewis heads to the pokey and picks him up.
While on the road to Venna-land, Fuller buys a cheap used CB radio,
installs it in the car and starts fiddling with the old machine ("This
is like a prehistoric Internet!" he chirps happily). Before long, he
gets Lewis to join in the fun, adopting a female voice and using the
name Candy Kane to stir up nearby truckers. In short order, a
gravel-voiced driver using the handle Rusty Nail starts chatting with
Ms. Kane.
The boys carry the prank further, luring Rusty Nail to a local motel for
a rendezvous with the fictitious young lovely, while they press their
ears to the wall of a neighboring room to listen to the reaction. But
the practical joke explodes and the boys find themselves pursued across
the dark rural highways by a killer bent on vengeance. When they pick up
Venna, things get even worse  Rusty Nail decides that, in lieu of Candy
Kane, Venna will do.
The actors make fine surrogates for the viewer. Paul Walker is the
bland, easily influenced everyman, Leelee Sobieski stays suitably
wide-eyed as a bright kid thrust into an insane situation and Steve Zahn
adds texture as the comic relief who watches in horror as his little
joke turns lethal.
Rusty Nail is a great villain. We've all heard voices like his calling
right-wing chat shows late at night, talking conspiracies and
Armageddon. Wisely, the filmmakers never show us his face. Foolishly,
they do show the gruesome results of his attacks  in general, a
description of something horrible is far more chilling than a picture.
Despite an over-reliance on stunt driving late in the proceedings, "Joy
Ride" works because we know that there really are crazy people out
there, and that on any given night we could become the target of one of
them.

Review for Man Who Knew Too Little, The (1997)
The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)
Bill Murray, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley, Alfred Molina, Richard 
Wilson
Rated PG, Two and one half out of five stars.

In one of the commercials for "The Man Who Knew Too Little," Bill Murray 
gives his assurance that the new comedy works, wrapping up his pitch by 
saying "If you don't think it's funny, I'll personally give you your 
money back. That is, if you can find me. I mean, I'm not easy to find, 
but if you do, if you stop me on the street or something, I'll give you 
some money." 
While Bill and his wallet won't have to go into hiding, the unfortunate 
truth is that the ad is funnier than most of the actual movie. "The Man 
Who Knew Too Little" is a cute film with a clever premise. It's sometimes 
funny and frequently amusing, but rarely breaks into flat-out hilarity. 
That would be enough from most performers, but with Bill Murray you just 
expect more.
Remember, we're talking about the man who single-handedly took the hack 
comedy "Meatballs" and made it a success. Murray is a one-of-a-kind 
talent, a putty-faced comic anarchist capable of taking the lamest 
premise and making it side-splitting. His early work, in films like 
"Stripes", "Ghostbusters" and "Caddyshack," was marked by an ironic 
deadpan delivery, punctuated by explosive outbursts at unexpected moments.
 Murray was dangerous, one of most outrageous of the SNL bad boys, and 
all of his manic energy came out onscreen. He became a legend by playing 
the ultimate wise-guy, and when he tried to depart from that persona, his 
work suffered. Murray took fewer and fewer starring roles, focusing 
instead on inspired cameos in films such as "Little Shop Of Horrors," "Ed 
Wood," and "Kingpin." 
In recent years, Murray has returned to lead roles, recapturing some of 
his former glory in "Quick Change," "What About Bob," and "Groundhog Day."
"The Man Who Knew Too Little" finds Murray playing a less neurotic 
version of the wide-eyed innocent from "What About Bob."  Murray's 
Wallace Ritchie is an amiable loser, a clerk in a Des Moines Blockbuster 
Video who tells strangers he "works in film." When his younger brother, a 
successful businessman living in England, sends him money for his 
birthday, Ritchie impulsively hops a plane to London to visit him. 
Wallace's arrival startles brother James (Peter Gallagher) and wife 
Barbara (Anna Chancellor.) Hours away from an important business meeting, 
they can ill-afford an unpredictable guest, so James buys his brother a 
ticket to "The Theater Of Life," a participatory experience where he will 
assume a character and join a group of actors to play out a mystery story 
in real-world settings. Wallace reluctantly accepts the gift and begins 
the evening as directed, by going to an assigned street corner and 
waiting for a nearby pay phone to ring and begin the experience. 
Unfortunately, Wallace gets a call intended for a hired-assassin. 
Thinking it part of the play, he trots off to begin his adventure, not 
realizing that the international intrigue surrounding him is not only 
real, but potentially lethal.
The screwball comedy has the feel of a 60s spy film. Layered with 
subplots, the story overflows with secret agents, blackmail, bombs and 
murderous henchmen. The humor comes as Wallace navigates from one 
incredibly dangerous situation to the next, believing it all to be part 
of an elaborate game. Meanwhile, his adversaries are stunned by the cool 
fearlessness of this mysterious American. 
"The Man Who Knew Too Little" is filled with clever scenes that are 
*almost* a riot, but rarely slip over the edge into hilarity. The problem 
certainly isn't Murray, who clearly has a ball playing the hapless 
Wallace. The supporting cast is also fine, particularly Joanne Whalley as 
Lori, Wallace's confused partner in intrigue. The set-up is amusing 
enough, especially a subplot involving British and Russian spies 
desperately trying to insure job security by re-igniting the Cold War. 
So why doesn't "The Man Who Knew Too Little" soar? The problem lies with 
director Jon Amiel ("Copycat", "Sommersby",) who just doesn't have a 
knack for comedy. Amiel takes the spy motif too far, using camera angles 
that accentuate the suspense elements of the story, but mute the humor. 
He seems more interested in unreeling the convoluted story than in making 
the audience laugh. The result is a muffled comedy. The performances are 
there, the situations are there, everyone is really trying, but the 
damned thing just isn't funny enough. At least not funny enough for a 
movie with Bill Murray's name on it.

Title
Review for Palmetto (1998)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/
Archive reviews at http://us.imdb.com/M/reviews_by?Edward+Johnson-ott
In French, the phrase "film noir" literally means "black film." Webster 
defines it as "a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent 
characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed 
by shadowy photography and foreboding background music." Classic film 
noir, including such memorable fare as "The Big Sleep," the original 
"Cape Fear," and Orson Welles' striking "A Touch Of Evil," employed black 
and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the 
genre. Color came into play with neo-noir films like "Chinatown" and 
"Blade Runner." "L.A. Confidential," easily the best film of 1997, is a 
wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking. For a textbook 
example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an 
absolute mess, there's "Palmetto." 
Based on "Just Another Sucker," a short story written by British author 
Rene Raymond under the pseudonym James Hadley Chase, "Palmetto" shows 
what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance. Director 
Volker Schlondorff ("Tin Drum, "The Handmaid's Tale") stated "We weren't 
even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy." 
It shows. "Palmetto" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a 
thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy.  
The story begins when journalist Harry Barber (Woody Harrelson) is 
released from prison. Someone turned state's witness and revealed that 
Harry was framed, a "reward" for blowing the lid on corruption in the 
small Florida town of Palmetto. Bitter and broke, Harry plans to 
hitchhike to Miami and start his life over, but ex-girlfriend Nina (Gina 
Gershon) appears to return him to Palmetto. While hanging out at a bar, 
he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth. 
Harry pockets her cash, only to have the woman reappear and catch him 
with her money in his pocket. No problem, though. The radiant blonde is 
Rhea Malroux (Elisabeth Shue,) the young wife of a very rich older man 
with heart problems, and she has a proposition for Harry. Rhea needs "a 
threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom" for the staged 
kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter Odette (Chloe Sevigny.) The girls 
want to bilk a half-million dollar "ransom" from the old man and will 
happily give Harry $50,000 for helping with the scam. 
Things go wrong, of course. Odette is found dead, leaving Harry 
frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks. In an 
ironic twist, Harry is asked to work for the local D.A.'s office. They 
need a press liaison to field questions about Odette's kidnapping and 
feel that Harry is the perfect man for the job.
Not a bad set-up for a noir film, if only Schlondorff knew how to handle 
the material, but he never settles on a consistent tone. The actors don't 
know what to do with their characters either, muddling the proceedings 
even further. As if that wasn't enough, the story suffers from major 
problems in logic.
Woody Harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take 
on risky parts, but he's lost here. Presented as a crusading journalist 
who was horribly wronged, it makes no sense that Harry would be stupid 
and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme. Harrelson clearly 
doesn't know what to do with Harry's character, so he spends most of the 
film glowering, sweating and generally acting miserable. Meanwhile, 
Elisabeth Shue gives a goofy performance, behaving like a vamp on nitrous 
oxide. As the stepdaughter, Chloe Sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks 
that she comes off like Juliette Lewis Jr. Despite a number of steamy 
scenes, there's no chemistry between Harrelson and the women. To make 
matters worse, Schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's 
lips are running over each others bodies.
Two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems. While driving 
with a body in his trunk, Harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up. 
The officer wants to help change Harry's flat tire and asks him to open 
the trunk. Harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have 
worked if played as comedy, but under Schlondorff's grim direction, the 
scene is just embarrassing. 
The film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill Harry and Nina. 
We're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub 
filled with acid, but by this point the film has foundered so badly that 
the scene is merely reminiscent of when Jessica and Roger Rabbit were 
suspended over a vat of dip. 
Had "Palmetto" been played with tongue firmly in cheek, it might have 
been an entertaining shaggy dog story. But under the harsh direction of 
Schlondorff, the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo-
noir cluelessness. Avoid this nonsense and go see "L.A. Confidential" 
instead.

"All the Pretty Horses" is a frustrating piece of work. The western, an
adaptation of the acclaimed novel by Cormac McCarthy, starts off great,
introducing two appealing cowboys and carefully establishing the
dynamics of their relationship, then adding a third, enormously likable
bad boy to the mix. But, just when the production gets rolling, the
movie separates the threesome and fractures, splintering into a series
of rushed vignettes.
Director Billy Bob Thornton's preferred version of the film was four
hours long. After many months of fighting with evil studio executives
who demanded a film that theatergoers might actually sit through,
Thornton hacked his pet project down to 117 minutes. The stitches show.
After a satisfying, leisurely opening, you can almost hear Billy Bob
exclaim, "Sweet Jesus, look at all the story I still have to cram in
there! Get me the shears and transparent tape, I've got to take some
elaborate plotlines and turn them into Cliffs Notes!"
What suffers most is a romance between cowpoke John Grady Cole (Matt
Damon) and Alejandro (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of a powerful
rancher. Many critics have complained that there is zero chemistry
between Damon and Cruz. Wrong. The chemistry is there, what's missing is
sufficient time for us to accept their relationship. As presented here,
the couple goes from "Pleased to meet you" to "I love you more than life
itself" in about the time it takes a boy band to croon a ditty.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. You probably would like to know the
basic story before I start telling you what's wrong with it.
In a small Texas town in 1949, John Grady Cole learns that, due to a
power shift following the death of his grandpa, the family ranch is to
be sold by hard-hearted city folk. Disillusioned, Cole and his best pal,
Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas), decide to head for Mexico in search of the
West they feel is slipping away.
So far, so good. Damon, looking lean and eager, creates a persona that
neatly blends practical skills with a romanticized outlook, while "E.T."
veteran Thomas is quite strong as Lacey, Cole's pragmatic, but
good-humored buddy. Together, they make a great team.
Shortly before crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico, the guys meet up
with trouble on a stick, in the form of young Jimmy Blevins (Lucas
Black), a twerp whose gunplay is as good as his grammar is bad. Perched
atop a horse that is probably stolen, Jimmy leeches onto the duo despite
their attempts to shake him. Black, who co-starred with Thornton in
"Sling Blade," is wonderful, stealing scenes and giving the whole
production a greater sense of authenticity.
So, naturally, he is the first to disappear. After losing "his" horse in
a hilarious lightning storm scene, Jimmy spots someone else with the
steed and decides to steal it back. During the chase that follows, Jimmy
splits off from Cole and Lacey, taking a goodly portion of the film's
vitality with him.
The guys hire on as hands at a massive ranch owned by the aristocratic
Rocha (Ruben Blades), where, in one of the best segments in the movie,
they prove remarkably adept at breaking horses, just as Billy Bob
Thornton begins to display his lack of proficiency in the editing
department. Cole becomes friends with Rocha, while Lacey fades
inexplicably (at least to me) into the background, taking more of the
film's vitality with him.
>From here on, the film adopts a choppy vignette motif. Cole and
Alejandra have their MTV montage romantic build-up, which includes a
skinny-dipping scene that only shows the couple from the shoulders up
(Note to Billy Bob: Covering up the bodies of Matt Damon and Penelope
Cruz is a terrible waste of natural resources). Then Cole faces off with
Alejandra's powerful Aunt Alfonsa (Miriam Colon).
At this point, you can almost see Billy Bob watching the clock as the
editing becomes even more abrupt. Bam! Cole and Lacey get arrested. Bam!
Jimmy returns. Bam! Face-off with cops in the desert. Bam! Shots. Bam!
Prison. Bam! Fights. Bam! Deals. Bam! More face-offs. Bam! Bam! Bam! Cue
the closing credits.
Regarding "All the Pretty Horses," Matt Damon told Talk Magazine, "The
four-hour version of that movie is the best movie I've been in in my
entire life." I'm looking forward to the DVD release of the film, where
we'll hopefully get the chance to see that version, instead of the
sometimes rewarding, but far too episodic Reader's Digest version in
theaters now.
A final note: After scanning quite a few critiques of "All the Pretty
Horses," I am proud to point out that this is one of the only reviews in
America not to employ the words "laconic" and "elegiac." Until just now,
that is.

Like "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "I'll Be Home For Christmas" is a 
cross-country road story about the travails of trying to return home for 
the holidays. Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars in this lightweight Disney 
comedy that, while far from memorable, is at least pleasant. 
With holiday films of this sort, no one expects any surprises. Thomas 
plays a self-absorbed young man trying to go home for all the wrong 
reasons, and there is absolutely no doubt that he will make it home and 
will learn valuable life lessons along the way. It's a standard film 
structure and the entertainment factor depends on how well the filmmakers 
and cast connect the dots. In this case, the results are, well, pleasant.
Jake (Thomas) is a smooth talking con artist at a Los Angeles college. 
Uncomfortable over his father remarrying a mere 10 months after his 
mother's death, the kid has avoided visiting the homestead. Anxious to 
see his son, Dad (Gary Cole) offers a bribe: if Jake makes it to the 
family's home in New York state by 6 p.m. Christmas eve, he gets a 
vintage Porsche. 
Things go awry, of course. A group of football players, angered over one 
of Jake's botched scams, dumps him in the middle of the desert, dressed 
in a Santa suit with the beard and hat glued to his head. To make matters 
worse, his girlfriend Allie (Jessica Biel) is also on the road east, 
traveling with Eddie (Adam Lavorgna), Jake's loutish arch enemy.
Naturally, as Jake strains to make it home before the deadline, two 
things have to happen: he must encounter a variety of colorful eccentrics 
and repeatedly almost catch up with his girlfriend. To their credit, the 
filmmakers show some imagination while working the formula. Jake meets a 
clueless thief (Andrew Lauer, the guy on skates from "Caroline in the 
City") and a heartsick cop (Sean O'Bryan), leading up to a cute scene 
that is both sentimental and funny. 
A meeting between Jake, Allie and Eddie in a Midwest Bavarian village is 
also cleverly staged, although it contains a "Three's Company" style 
scene that falls flat on its face. Jake finds his girlfriend's motel room 
which, out of sheer necessity, she shared with Eddie. While Jake and 
Allie are talking, Eddie comes out of the bathroom wearing only a towel. 
Allie quickly makes it clear that she is not romantically or sexually 
involved with the guy and Eddie makes a smart-aleck remark. What's Jake's 
response? He inexplicably jerks Eddie's towel off, leaving the 
athletically-built young man standing nude in front of his girlfriend. 
The mildly-embarrassed Eddie grabs something to cover his genitals, Allie 
shows no reaction whatsoever, and I scratched my head, wondering why a 
scene as illogical, poorly-staged and unfunny as this one was left in the 
film.
That peculiar episode aside, "I'll Be Home For Christmas" works more 
often than not. The performances range from pretty good (Biel, O'Bryan 
and Lauer), to fair (Lavorgna), to cardboard (everyone in Jake's family). 
As for Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the "Home Improvement" graduate really 
needs to work on his facial expressions. Regardless of the emotional 
state of his character, there's always a vague hint of a smirk on Thomas' 
face, rendering his scenes of redemption less than convincing.
As far as holiday movies go, "I'll Be Home For Christmas" ranks right in 
the middle of the pack. It's mixture of smiles and sentiment is good 
enough for the film to qualify as a mildly pleasant diversion, but lacks 
that special magic necessary for it to rise above average. If you're a 
Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan, prepare for a veritable Thomas-fest. If not, 
rent "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and see how the big boys work the 
holiday formula.

Review for Your Friends & Neighbors (1998)
Your Friends and Neighbors (1998)
Jason Patric, Ben Stiller, Catherine Keener, Aaron Eckhart, Amy Brenneman,
 Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute. 100 minutes. 
R, 4 stars (out of five stars)

During sex-ed back in school, the first thing our teacher said was "Sex 
is communication. If you remember nothing else about my class, please try 
to remember that." "Your Friends and Neighbors" is about six people who 
have a great deal of trouble communicating. Variously angry, self-
absorbed, over-analytical or simply needy, they couple in a variety of 
sexual combinations, but no one ever seems to end up satisfied. 
After a screening of this pitch-black comedy, one very upset journalist 
exclaimed "They're not my friends and neighbors! I don't know these 
people. I don't want to know these people!" I said nothing, but realized 
that I do know these people. I dated one of them. To be completely honest,
 there was an awful period of time when I was one of them. Extreme as 
they may be, the characters in "Your Friends and Neighbors" are drawn 
from contemporary culture. Look closely and you'll realize that they 
really are your friends and neighbors, and maybe you as well.
This is the second film from Fort Wayne writer and director Neil LaBute. 
His first, the brilliant "In the Company of Men," created a sensation 
last year and made most "Best of" lists at years-end. A dark study of 
power and cruelty, the film ended with a revelatory scene that forced 
audience members to rethink everything they had witnessed up to that 
moment. "Your Friends and Neighbors" contains no such scene. The last act 
of the film takes place in your head, as you try to sort out the actions 
and motivations of these six people.
Jason Patric is a hard-bodied predator who rehearses his sex talk and 
plays tapes of it on his Walkman during workouts. Asked if he considers 
himself a good person, he angrily snaps "Hey, I'm eating lunch!" then 
tells of using pilfered hospital stationery to exact revenge by sending 
an anonymous note to an ex-girlfriend stating that she had been exposed 
to the HIV virus. He acknowledges that he may face repercussions if 
Judgment Day ever comes, but "until then, we're on my time." 
Aaron Eckhart (Chad from "In the Company of Men") is a rumpled sad sack 
who confesses that his favorite lover is himself. He's not kidding. After 
a failed sex session with Amy Brenneman, his unassuming wife, he 
masturbates beneath the covers while she curls in the fetal position and 
pretends to be asleep. 
Ben Stiller is a pompous dramatics professor whose sex talk infuriates 
his lover, Catherine Keener. "Let's just do it," she growls in 
frustration, "I don't need the narration." Both try to augment their 
hollow love lives by seeking extracurricular partners. Ben invites Amy to 
have an affair with him, while Catherine cozies up to Nastassja Kinski, 
an artist's assistant at a local gallery. After they have sex and Kinski 
asks Keener which part of the lovemaking was her favorite, she replies, 
"I liked the silence best.''
"Your Friends and Neighbors" is often bleak and occasionally nightmarish, 
but also extremely funny. LaBute films his dark character study using a 
number of distancing devices. There are no exterior shots in the story's 
generic city, and the character's names are never spoken. As a result, we 
watch them with an almost clinical detachment, enabling us to laugh, 
rather than cry, at the foibles of the sextet. 
The acting is quite good as well. Jason Patric's intensity has worked 
against him in previous films, but it's completely appropriate for this 
character, and he gives a blistering performance. His finest moment comes 
when he describes his most memorable sexual experience. In a four minute 
scene with no cuts, the camera moves ever closer to Patric's face as he 
delivers an absolutely riveting monologue recounting a violent sexual 
encounter that he remembers with great fondness. It's twisted, horrific 
and a terrific piece of acting.
Aaron Eckhart is exceptional as the antithesis of his "In the Company of 
Men" character, particularly during a wonderfully nuanced confrontational 
scene with his wife. Catherine Keener imbues her damaged character with a 
humanity that softens the cold words she speaks. Her facial expressions 
when Jason Patric verbally assaults her in a bookstore are heartbreaking. 
As the foppish professor, Ben Stiller is appropriately smarmy, while 
Nastassja Kinski gives her character a wispy, beguiling feel. Amy 
Brenneman also impresses as the most enigmatic of the group.
LaBute uses extended takes, stylistic repetition and variations of the 
same scene to give the film symmetry. Sometimes it works and sometimes it 
seems overly mannered. I've watched "Your Friends and Neighbors" three 
times and, at different points, viewed LaBute as a ferociously honest 
visionary and a smug elitist. I'm sure he would be delighted at my 
reactions. His ability to both enthrall and anger is testimony to his 
skills as a filmmaker and provocateur. Neil LaBute is the real deal and 
"Your Friends and Neighbors" is a hell of a movie.

The X-Men hold a special place in my heart. As a kid, I was there when they
made their debut in 1963. On the surface, the Marvel comic book bore quite a
resemblance to The Fantastic Four, another Stan Lee and Jack Kirby creation,
but the X-Men represented a crucial twist on the superhero concept. These
young people were mutants, treated with fear and hatred by mainstream
society just because they were different.
Such an inspired notion. In one fell swoop, Lee and Kirby gave the
disenfranchised a comic they could call their own. The X-Men were surrogates
for blacks, gays, alienated teens - any group who felt the sting of
stereotyping and societal intolerance. While Superman and the Fantastic Four
battled galactic overlords, the X-Men were busy fighting simply for their
right to be, and kicking major bigot ass when necessary.
Professor Charles Xavier, a wheelchair-bound telepath of enormous power,
served as teacher, father figure and group leader in his position as
headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Children, a haven for mutant
youth. Over the years, the series experienced major changes, including an
enormously successful reboot that replaced the original students with a more
ethnic and racially diverse group of mutants. Eventually, the X-Men
franchise split into a series of titles featuring so many characters that it
was virtually impossible to keep track of them all.
Twenty-seven years after their creation, the X-Men have finally made it to
the big screen, in what may well be the best cinematic superhero adaptation
to date. While director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") shifts
characters around and stumbles periodically, he has captured the essence of
the comic book. The core team makeup is different, featuring two of the
original group and three from the later days, but the magic remains the
same.
"X-Men" takes place in the near future, with ultra-conservative Senator
Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) campaigning for the Mutant Registration Act,
which would allow the government to keep tabs on any citizen with mutant
DNA. While Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) of the X-Men tries to reason with
the self-righteous politician at a Senate hearing, Professor Xavier (Patrick
Stewart) senses the presence of an old friend in the chamber. The mutant
known as Magneto (Ian McKellan) does not share the guarded optimism of
Xavier. A Holocaust survivor, Magneto sees the hearings as the first step
towards a genetic war, and the master of magnetism is ready to make a
preemptive strike.
The battle lines are drawn. Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants: the
shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), man-beast Sabretooth (Tyler
Mane) and Toad (Ray "Darth Maul" Park), an incredibly agile creature with a
tongue that would make Gene Simmons weep with envy, versus Xavier's A-Team:
Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots laser blasts from his eyes, weather
witch Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey, who has a major in telekinesis and
a minor in telepathy. Joining the trio are two newcomers: Rogue (Anna
Paquin), a teen who temporarily drains the life force from anyone she
touches, and Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), a skilled athlete with amazing
healing powers and retractable, razor sharp claws that spring from the top
of his hands.
Director Singer, working from David Hayter's efficient script, forwards the
plot while providing a wealth of treats for X-fans. While visiting the
school, which has a much larger population than the one in the comic, other
brief, but cleverly staged appearances. There are several in-jokes for
attentive viewers, and we see the beginning of the love triangle between
Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey.
While most superhero movies struggle for an epic feel, "X-Men" thankfully
sets its burners a bit lower, playing like a solid issue of a cinematic
comic book and taking the time to flesh out a few major characters. The
story revolves around Wolverine, with Aussie actor Hugh Jackson giving a
knockout performance as the Canuck loner (asked if it hurts when his claws
come out, he quietly answers "Every time."). Although the onscreen Rogue is
significantly different from her comic book counterpart, Anna Paquin
beautifully conveys the angst of a girl who cannot ever enjoy the touch of
another person. And, thanks to a heart-wrenching prologue, we see the
damaged child beneath Magneto's regal persona. As expected, Ian McKellen and
Patrick Stewart are wonderful, particularly during their scenes together.
Despite limited screen time, Famke Janssen firmly establishes Jean Grey as
one tough, smart cookie and, in James Marsden's hands, the smirking,
tight-assed Cyclops becomes the perfect foil for Wolverine's verbal barbs.
Unfortunately, Halle Berry's Storm receives no personal development. To make
matters worse, Berry is saddled with a chintzy white wig straight from the
Eva Gabor Woolworth's collection.
Other quibbles include Sabretooth's growl, which sounds too much like the
MGM lion. A synthesis of animal and human roars would have been more
effective. And, primarily due to extensive wire work, some of the action
segments are a bit stiff. But these are minor complaints. "X-Men" neatly
balances character interaction with grand battles, while never forgetting
the theme that made the series a pop classic. For this fan, the film was a
very pleasant surprise. I suspect that those unfamiliar with the comic book
will have quite the good time as well.

Review for Titanic (1997)
Titanic (1997)
Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, 
Gloria Stuart, Frances Fisher. Directed by James Cameron. 197 minutes
Rated PG-13, **** and one half stars (out of ***** stars)
Late at night, a beautiful young woman clinging to a makeshift raft looks 
up into the distance. The sky over the Atlantic Ocean is cloudless and 
her tired, desperate eyes gaze at the stars, glistening in the heavens so 
very far away. The scene is simple, elegant and haunting, nicely 
illustrating why "Titanic" works. Director James Cameron uses a grand 
sweeping backdrop to tell an elementary love story, and he tells it very 
well. "Titanic" contains some of the most spectacular visuals ever to 
appear on screen, but despite the jaw-dropping special effects, it's the 
human story that lingers after you leave the theater. Cameron has crafted 
an epic that triumphs because he remembered the crucial fact that affairs 
of the heart are far more compelling than any special effect.
"Titanic" received massive press coverage for production delays, clashes 
on the set and, of course, its record-breaking $200 million dollar budget.
 Over the last decade, we've become a nation of media insiders, receiving 
tremendous amounts of behind-the-scenes information from the 
entertainment world. At the end of each weekend, movie buffs study the 
box office results as if they were football scores, measuring the success 
of a movie by how much money it takes in, rather than by evaluating the 
actual substance of the film. It's an absurd mindset; one that needs to 
be put aside in order to best enjoy "Titanic." Production and budget 
information may be intriguing, but the only question that really matters 
is whether or not the film is any good, and "Titanic" certainly is. 
The story begins in the present, as an explorer (Bill Paxton) and his 
crew search the wreckage of the Titanic for a legendary diamond called 
"The Heart Of The Ocean." Framing the historical saga with present-day 
scenes is more than a gimmick. Cameron uses the conceit to give the story 
an almost fairy-tale quality. Additionally, the crew presents a computer-
graphic simulation of the precise mechanics of the Titanic's sinking, 
making it much easier to follow what's happening when the disaster 
finally occurs. 
Rose, an elderly Titanic survivor (Gloria Stuart) joins the group after 
recognizing some personal possessions from a news report of the 
expedition. Peering into the glass of a hand mirror recovered from the 
ship, she quietly says "It looks the same as it did when I last saw it, 
but the reflection has changed." Her ancient eyes grow distant as she 
recounts her tale to the crew.
Cut to April, 1912, as the Titanic prepares for her maiden voyage. The 
opulent ship is magnificent, a paean to Victorian excess. Cameron 
provides a leisurely tour of the vessel as the passengers board and we 
meet the two central characters. Young Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) 
is desperately unhappy. She dreads her pending marriage to wealthy snob 
Cal Hockley (Billy Zane,) but can't break off the engagement. Despite 
their upper crust trappings, Rose and her mother (Frances Fisher) are 
broke and need the financial security the marriage will provide. In a 
moment of panic, Rose climbs over the rail of the ship, contemplating a 
suicidal dive, when penniless artist-at-large Jack Dawson (Leonardo 
DiCaprio,) who won his ticket in a poker game, intervenes and romance 
blossoms between the two.  
James Cameron states adamantly that "Titanic" is not a disaster film and 
he's right. Disaster films generally take 10-15 characters and try to 
tell all of their stories. The result is typically a jumbled mess of 
clichés. Cameron instead chose to take the very basic story of one 
representative couple and keep his focus there. Jack and Rose are just a 
couple of kids experiencing the awkwardness and exhilaration of first 
love, but they matter. Against the backdrop of a doomed vessel, these two 
young lovers come alive, and we feel all the poignancy of their situation.
 The magic Winslet and DiCaprio generate underscores the tragedy 
befalling everyone on the ship. 
Winslet is splendid, by the way. Her wonderfully nuanced performance is 
among the years best. And DiCaprio, one of the most annoyingly smug 
actors in the business, is warm and winning here. 
And then there's the wreck. Despite some occassionally shaky special 
effects, Cameron's realization of the Titanic's crash and collapse is 
flat-out breathtaking. He fills the screen with images of devastation on 
a scale unlike anything ever seen in a movie before. By putting the human 
story ahead of the effects, the nightmarish scenes carry an emotionally 
resonance far beyond mere spectacle. Tragic, beautiful and haunting, 
"Titanic" uses 90s technology to create an old-fashioned Hollywood 
blockbuster. It's three hours and fifteen minutes long, but the time 
flies by, and you can't pay a movie a higher compliment than that.

The computer-animated comedy "Shrek" is designed to be enjoyed on
different levels by different groups. For children, it offers
imaginative visuals, appealing new characters mixed with a host of
familiar faces, loads of action and a barrage of big laughs (including
numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances, apparently
a requisite in contemporary family films). For adults, it's a fractured
fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the
kids. All in all, "Shrek" is a snappy ride, although there are a couple
of points I found disturbing.
But first the basics. Based very loosely on a 1990 children's story,
"Shrek" follows several momentous days in the life of the title
character, a rotund green ogre voiced by Mike Myers in that pleasant
Scottish accent he is so fond of using. Shrek is a grumpy fellow living
a solitary life deep in the swamp, until a local nobleman disturbs his
peace.
Petty tyrant Lord Farquaad (take away the "awk" in the middle and you
have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners) owns the land on
which Shrek resides. He proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an Ellis
Island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings
from his castle. As a result, Shrek finds himself surrounded by legends
like the Three Blind Mice, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, the Seven
Dwarfs, and the Three Bears, to name but a few.
An enraged Shrek storms to the castle, only to find Farquaad (John
Lithgow) ready to bargain. Lord Obnoxious wants to become king and the
magic mirror from "Snow White" has shown him the way. All he has to do
is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife. The mirror unveils
three choices in a presentation straight out of "The Dating Game" (when
Snow White is shown, the cheeky announcer purrs, "Even though she lives
with seven men, she's not easy!")
Farquaad selects the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and offers
Shrek a deal: If the ogre snatches Fiona from the dragon-protected, lava
moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the
throne, the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his
grounds. Shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest, accompanied
by a motor-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) determined to make the green
grump his best friend. They finally hook up with the princess, only to
learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet. For the
matter, the dragon offers a few surprises as well.
The movie references a great many other flicks, from "Babe" ("That'll
do, donkey. That'll do") to "The Graduate." But the lion's share of the
jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of Disney. The
public-domain characters made into icons in various Disney films take
their hits  Pinocchio is referred to as a "possessed toy" and when
Shrek spies a sleeping Snow White in his cabin, he bellows, "Get that
dead broad off the table!"  but the biggest slams come when Shrek
visits Farquaad's royal domicile, which closely resembles a certain
magic kingdom, from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of
animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy
tune that sounds a lot like "It's a Small World."
Which brings me to disturbing point number one. I laughed at all the
Disney swipes, but found the mentality behind them a bit sad. The
acrimony between Dreamworks honcho Jeff Katzenberg and Disney big wheel
Michael Eisner is well known. For years the two companies have tried to
sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar
competing productions on the same day. And now we have Katzenberg using
an entire movie to attack his former employer. Here's a suggestion for
the two boys: Grow up! Put the past behind you! There's room in the
sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice, then go to
your rooms!
The other area I found troubling came in the portrayal of Lord Farquaad.
Beyond all the irreverence, "Shrek" actually has a message: People
should learn to look beyond physical appearances, because true beauty
lies within. It's a lovely notion, but the film betrays its own moral by
incessantly taking cheap shots at Farquaad's diminutive stature. Do we
really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people
is acceptable? The pompous, selfish behavior of Farquaad is enough to
make him a target for zingers. Adding short jokes is simply mean.
Still, "Shrek" is a rollicking good time. The computer animation is
mostly impressive (although several key characters look like animated
rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky), the voice
work is strong (particularly from Eddie Murphy), the laughs come fast
and furious, and the moral, tainted though it may be, is a good one. To
trot out a cliché, "Shrek" is fun for all ages. Parents, though, should
remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others
because they are short, tall, skinny, fat, etc. is a bad thing.

Title
Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
Snake Eyes (1998)
Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, Kevin Dunn, Carla Gugino, Luis Guzman, John 
Heard, Stan Shaw. Screenplay by David Koepp. Directed by Brian De Palma. 
100 minutes 
Rated R, 2.5 stars (out of five stars)
"Snake Eyes" employs split screens, shots from various characters' points 
of view and a nifty scene where the camera moves overhead to where the 
ceiling should be and glides from room-to-room, providing aerial shots of 
the people below. Oh, and the movie also features a murder mystery. It's 
sad when a director's camera techniques are more memorable than the film 
they should be serving, which is exactly what happens in Brian De Palma's 
latest thriller. 
De Palma, who directed such fare as "Carrie," "Dressed To Kill," "Body 
Double," "The Untouchables," "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Mission 
Impossible," is well-known for his in-your-face approach to storytelling. 
He's also renown (or infamous, depending on who you talk to) for "paying 
homage" to various directors through his filmmaking methods. He certainly 
directs "Snake Eyes" with high style, although he appears to have been so 
busy with flourishes that he neglected to build a solid film beneath them.
The makings for a great thriller are there. Set in an Atlantic City 
casino, where a pay-per-view boxing match has begun while a hurricane 
rages outside, the story centers around the murder of a high-ranking 
government official. As heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) 
struggles to defend his title, shots ring out in the vast auditorium and 
the Secretary of Defense falls dead to the floor.
Two men take charge of the situation, sleazy local cop Nick Santoro 
(Nicholas Cage) and his best friend since childhood, Major Kevin Dunne 
(Gary Sinise), who was assigned to protect the Secretary. As they seal 
off the huge building to begin their investigation, a terrified young 
woman with blood on her clothing desperately tries to find a way out of 
the casino. The men marshal their forces and the chase is on.
De Palma begins the story with a nod to Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope," using 
camera tricks to make the first few minutes of the film look like one 
extremely long continuous shot. Sure, the effect is striking, but while 
De Palma was occupied creating eye candy, a lot of bad acting slipped 
through the lens of his magic camera.
Nicolas Cage is the worst culprit, hamming it up terribly as the smarmy 
boardwalk cop. Whooping and mugging in the opening scenes like a coked-up 
version of "Ernest Goes To Camp's" Jim Varney, Cage is flat-out 
embarrassing. No one behaving this way would have any credibility as an 
officer, even in Atlantic City. To add insult to injury, we're told this 
boob aspires to the office of mayor. Fat chance, Vern.
>From his first appearance in a open-collared Hawaiian shirt, with gold 
chains floating on his mat of chest hair (actually, Cage's body hair has 
now grown thick enough to officially qualify as a pelt), it's obvious 
that the Oscar-winning actor has decided to turn in a performance that 
makes his work as the villain in "Face/Off" look subtle. To be fair, he 
tones it down as the film progresses, but by then the damage is done. 
Meanwhile, Gary Sinise plays yet another fiercely intensive, control-
freak leader. In interviews, the gifted actor says he accepts films like 
"Snake Eyes" to fund his theatrical projects. That's wonderfully candid, 
but doesn't excuse wasting his skills with tiresome stereotypes like this.
Despite Cage and Sinise's failings, the investigation of the murder is 
very intriguing...for a while. De Palma shows the incident from several 
characters' points of view, each adding a little more insight into what 
really happened. He even examines the security camera recordings. It all 
leads to a major revelation that most viewers will have figured out 
minutes earlier.
Particularly annoying is De Palma's decision to reveal the villain 
relatively early in the film. After presenting lead characters who aren't 
likable, then prematurely spilling the beans on the identity of the bad 
guy, it's hard to remain interested in what happens during the remainder 
of the story, even with all of De Palma's inventive camera work. It's 
like watching somebody else put together a picture puzzle. When you're 
not personally involved, viewing the assembly process grows awfully 
tedious.
Adding insult to insult, De Palma wraps the picture up with an 
outrageously bad ending. Reportedly, a huge special effects shot was cut 
from the climax of "Snake Eyes" due to poor reactions from audiences at 
test screenings. It couldn't have been worse than what we see in the 
edited version. After more than an hour and a half of watching the forces 
of good and bad fight it out, De Palma resolves the elaborate battle with 
an act of pure chance. Ending the cat and mouse game with a burst of 
ingenious thinking would have been fine. Closing the story with a triumph 
of the human spirit over adversity would have been acceptable. But pure 
dumb luck? That's a hack ending from a director who should know better.

The first image in "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" is a
computer-animated close-up of a human eye. It's a beautiful piece of
work, remarkably detailed and quite convincing. When the picture pulls
back to reveal the owner of the eye, however, things change. The young
woman has mesmerizing hair, although it hangs too artfully  even by
movie standards  to be believed. The facial features are more detailed
than any computer-animation seen to date, but the result is more
reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human. She is
pretty, but bland, and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a
person.
All the characters in "Final Fantasy" are like that. Of the core group,
the younger white men and women are all athletic, attractive and
indistinct, like applicants for a TV reality show. The black man is
taller and burlier, and the aging scholar is bald, with wrinkles and a
beard. None of them appear to be based on individuals; they all look
like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist.
It gets worse when they talk and move. Why is the sarcastic voice of
Steve Buscemi, he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth, coming out
of the mouth of some dreary Ken doll? Why, for every fluid physical
gesture, do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions? More to the
point, who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring
"hyperReal" (their term, not mine) humanoids was a good idea?
"Final Fantasy" is based on a phenomenally popular video game I've never
played, with a story straight out of Japanese anime, which more often
than not leaves me bored and depressed. If you're a fan of either,
please spare me your letters, as I will focus solely on the finished
film and not its source materials. With an expression-challenged cast,
"Final Fantasy" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit.
The result is ugly, confusing and boring.
Note: The following reveals the basic plot. If you want to have a
fighting chance of making any sense of the movie, I suggest you read it.
Earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls. Most of
our planet is devastated, with humans living in a few protected cities.
While the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies, Aki Ross
(voiced by Ming-Na) and her mentor, Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland), believe
in a more organic approach. They operate on the notion (quoting straight
from the press kit) "that all life forms have signature spirit waves
that can be identified and contained. Aki and Dr. Sid collect a series
of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave
of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force.
The waves will, in effect, cancel each other out and disarm the foreign
contagion. They have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to
complete their wave. They are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining
two spirits before their time runs out."
Are you still with me? There's only a little more.
Aki is infected with the alien force. Dr. Sid has developed a method of
confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her, but the defense
wall won't hold much longer. Already, the alien is communicating with
Aki through her dreams. Aiding Aki and Dr. Sid are the Deep Eyes, a
group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the
troops in "Aliens." Capt. Gray Edwards (Alec Baldwin) heads the task
force that consists of a wise guy (Buscemi), a tough woman (Peri Gilpin)
and a gentle giant (Ving Rhames). Throwing a monkey wrench into the
plans is the requisite dumb ass: in this case General Hein (James
Woods), who wants to use the Zeus Cannon to bomb the aliens back to the
Stone Age, even if it destroys Earth as well.
So there you have it. Like most of the anime I've seen, the plot
combines apocalyptic settings, lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality,
all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow. But I'm bored with apocalyptic
settings. I understand why so many live-action films employ them 
they're cheap  but animated films can show anything, so why wallow in
an industrial trash heap?
The action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either. The humans move
oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice
cast can't bring them to life (in fact, their efforts merely emphasize
what we're missing). Aki is especially disappointing; with her lack of
expression and flat delivery, she looks and sound like a brunet version
of Weena, the Eloi girl from 1960's "The Time Machine." Drab color
choices and aliens that appear to have been created in Jell-O molds sap
the pizzazz from the big set pieces.
Students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology
behind "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within," but I found it sub-par
across the board. "Futurama" does more effective battle visuals, the
kids in "South Park" are far more expressive than these mannequins and
any old episode of the contemporary version of "The Outer Limits" does
better doom and gloom sci-fi. So who needs this? Not me.

Title
Review for Full Monty, The (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

Achive reviews at http://www.us.imdb.com/M/reviews_by?Edward+Johnson-ott
Remember the old adage "We're not laughing AT you, we're laughing WITH 
you"? That's what makes the delightful British film "The Full Monty" work 
so well. Over the course of 90 minutes spent with the most unlikely male 
strip troupe ever, their friends and neighbors go from laughing at them 
to laughing with them, and so do we. In addition to big laughs, "The Full 
Monty" has a big heart.
A series of vignettes sets up the sad plight of a group of men in 
Sheffield, England. They had been workers at the town's booming steel 
factory, but times have changed. Now the unemployed gents hang around the 
job center, playing cards and smoking while looking forward to nothing in 
particular. That is, until Gaz (Robert Carlyle, memorable as the 
explosive psycho in "Trainspotting") spies on a group of women at a 
Chippendale-style strip show. He overhears a lady gush "It's not their 
bodies, it's what they do with them" and decides that organizing a troupe 
of male strippers is the ticket to financial stability. Unfortunately, 
Gaz and his mates are light years from being buff, so they decide to 
overcome their liabilities in the physique department by stripping down 
to the full monty - - British slang for the works, which in this case 
means total nudity.
"The Full Monty" is smoothly paced, blending comedy and pathos deftly to 
create a breezy, enjoyable ride. The able cast takes a group of more-or-
less stock characters and makes them sympathetic and three-dimensional. 
Carlyle is beguiling as the scrawny Gaz, an energetic soul desperate to 
catch up on his support payments so he can continue spending time with 
his son. Gaz's best pal is Dave (Mark Addy), a chubby fellow whose 
insecurities have rendered him impotent. 
The men recruit their former boss, the now unemployed Gerald (Tom 
Wilkinson) because of his skills in ballroom dancing. A hilarious 
sequence of auditions result in three more additions to the troupe; a red-
headed suicidal loner (Steve Huison), a 50 year old who can do the funky 
chicken when his bad hip isn't acting up (Paul Barber), and cheerful, 
skinny Guy (Hugo Speer), who can't dance a lick, but will happily display 
his huge willy.
The men's financial and spiritual despair is crucial to "The Full Monty". 
Not only does it humanize the characters, but it makes the comic scenes 
even funnier, and make no mistake, "The Full Monty" is VERY funny. One of 
the highlights of the film is a sequence set in the unemployment office. 
While the glum men stand in line waiting to collect their checks, Donner 
Summer's "Hot Stuff" begins to play on the radio. The guys try to ignore 
it, but their toes begin tapping and, when the song hits a key passage, 
they involuntarily thrust their pelvises forward in unison, just like in 
rehearsals. 
Another great moment comes when a police officer happens on the men 
rehearsing in their red leather G-strings and arrests several of them for 
indecent exposure. In the police station, officers run a surveillance 
tape showing the men's rehearsal and Gaz and Gerald immediately begin 
critiquing their performances, ignoring the raucous laughter of the cops. 
When the local newspaper prints the story of the arrests, the men's 
secret plans become public knowledge and events swing towards a giddy 
conclusion. Forced to be honest with their spouses and friends about the 
planned performance, the men are mortified, but things take an unexpected 
and charming turn. 
"The Full Monty" is advertised as a comedy, but it is more than that. In 
unassuming fashion, the film deals with love, pride and despair, body 
shame, and the joy of abandoning inhibitions. The film also boasts a 
strong sense of community. The citizens of Sheffield have all suffered in 
varying degrees from the town's recession. Initially they scoff at the 
men's absurd plans, but when the idea sinks in, moods begin to change. 
The sheer audacity of the guys' idea strikes a chord with their neighbors.
 When the big performance finally rolls around, it's extremely funny, but 
not in any derisive fashion. The spectacle of the men prancing onstage 
becomes an act of defiance, of liberation. Do the men actually show the 
full monty? You'll have to wait and see, but it is safe to predict that 
few people will leave the theater without broad smiles on their faces.

"Meet the Parents" is often funny and occasionally hilarious. I laughed
a lot at the story of a young man's nightmarish weekend with his
potential in-laws, but not as much as the people around me. Part comedy
of manners, part slapstick farce, the film does everything it sets out
to do, yet I still felt vaguely unsatisfied. Finally, I realized what
was troubling me.
I've seen this type of farce done better on "Frasier." Remember the
episode where the Crane family tried to help Daphne rid herself of an
old flame, only to get caught in an ever-increasing spiral of lies? Or
the one where Niles and Frasier vied for the sole open slot at an upper
crust men's club? How about the one where Niles mistakenly thought his
wife was having an affair with her fencing instructor and ended up in a
duel with the man, while his brother and a maid haplessly tried to
conquer a multi-language barrier? Or the one set at the ski lodge, where
five characters spent a sexually fevered night slipping from one room to
another, repeatedly ending up with the wrong person?
Each of those episodes featured tighter, more inventive plots and deeper
character development than "Meet the Parents." The comedy is a spirited,
relatively satisfying affair, but with names like Robert De Niro and Ben
Stiller attached to the project, I expect more.
Stiller plays a Chicago nurse named Greg Focker (and yes, the script
milks his last name to the hilt). Greg is on the verge of proposing
marriage to schoolteacher Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) when she announces her
sister's engagement to a man who took the old-fashioned approach, going
to the father to secure his approval before popping the question.
Not to be outdone, Greg decides to accompany Pam to the wedding so that
he, too, can ask for his beloved's hand. He meets Pam's charming mother,
Dina (Blythe Danner) and her imposing father, Jack (De Niro) at their
sprawling home. Greg soon learns two things about Jack. First, he is
fiercely protective of Pam. Second, while introduced as a retired
florist, Jack is actually an ex-C.I.A. operative, with all the tools of
the agency at his disposal.
So begins the worst weekend of Greg's life, as he desperately tries to
curry favor from a father who peers at him like a shepherd eyeing a
coyote. The harder Greg tries, the more mistakes he makes, with Jack's
elaborate security cameras catching every screw-up. Making matters even
worse is the arrival of Pam's ex-boyfriend Kevin (Owen Wilson), a
too-perfect-for-words gentleman who took up carpentry because he
considers Jesus an excellent role model. Intimidated beyond belief, Greg
finds himself the center of an escalating series of misadventures,
beginning with the accidental destruction of a family urn and building
to riotous extremes.
"Meet the Parents" has all the elements for a memorable farce and
succeeds more often than not. Ben Stiller displays ace comic timing
portraying a schnook floundering in the deep end of the societal pool.
As the menacing straight man, Robert De Niro makes a great foil, looking
far more comfortable here than he did in "Analyze This." Don't expect
any surprises from either actor, though  both are playing variations of
their standard personas. The only revelation comes from Owen Wilson
("Shanghai Noon"), who reinvents himself as a being of otherworldly
nobility. Wilson is a true original, becoming more impressive with each
new film.
Pity the women in the production, who are given little to work with.
Blythe Danner does what she can with a sorely underwritten part, giving
Dina a wry sparkle that shades her character in ways the script doesn't
even hint at. As Pam, Teri Polo is simply there. There are no sparks
between her and Stiller as she plays a girlfriend from the generic rack.
The flatness of the female characters is but one flaw in a screenplay
that would have been well served by a rewrite or two. After a fairly
taut beginning, "Meet the Parents" grows awfully sloppy in the middle,
lobbing gags around with little style or grace. Director Jay Roach
handles the material clumsily, focusing on large set pieces at the
expense of smooth pacing or character development.
The best farces or comedies of manners flow like a mountain stream, with
finely etched personalities shaping the direction and speed of the
humor. "Meet the Parents" is more like a drainage ditch, with jokes
overlapping as the story gushes to a fitful conclusion. The film is
undeniably funny, but with some finesse, it could have been so much
better. Note to Jay Roach and company: Before you make your next movie,
think things through, construct fully rounded characters and, for Pete's
sake, watch a few episodes of "Frasier."

When the Cuban missile crisis happened in 1962, I was too little to
understand the particulars. I remember sitting on the carpet in front of
our black and white TV while John F. Kennedy spoke in solemn tones about
the conflict. Afterwards, my father looked grim and my mother unusually
anxious as they discussed what the young president had said. In bed that
night, I tried unsuccessfully to sort it out. All I really knew was that
a face-off was occurring over Russian rockets and, if somebody didn't
back down, there was a good chance that the world would come to an end.
"Thirteen Days" provides a flawed but gripping look at the United
States' side of the crisis and shows that the men in the White House
were just as scared as I was. We see events primarily through the eyes
of presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), a former classmate
of Bobby Kennedy and a close friend and confidant of both the Kennedy
boys. There are positives and negatives to the "World According to
Kenny" storytelling motif. On the plus side, it keeps the focus firmly
on the inner circle, establishing and maintaining a unique intensity. By
following O'Donnell, the filmmakers can offer personal observations and
glimpses of family life without concocting situations or exchanges for
John or Bobby Kennedy.
But the approach puts blinders on the audience similar to those that
were on the President and his advisors. Amazingly, there was no direct
line between the White House and the Kremlin in those days. For the most
part, messages were filtered through public speeches and private
meetings with ambassadors. On October 16, 1962, when U.S. aerial spy
photographs revealed the presence of Soviet medium-range ballistic
missiles in Cuba, the White House saw what Russia was doing, but had no
idea why.
And neither does the audience. The truth is that, after dealing with
President Kennedy at a summit meeting, Soviet Premier Khrushchev
dismissed our commander in chief as a lightweight and decided that the
USSR could get away with such a daring stunt. That's an important piece
of information that we never hear during "Thirteen Days." In fact, over
the course of the film's 144 minutes, we never get any specifics on the
Russian leader's mindset.
It's not as if the facts were unavailable. A number of documentaries
depict the goings-on in both Washington and Moscow, as did ABC in the
early '70s, when the network presented "The Missiles of October," a
well-received dramatization starring William Devane as John Kennedy,
Martin Sheen as Bobby and Howard da Silva as Khrushchev.
While the filmmakers behind "Thirteen Days" would likely argue that
their approach makes dramatic sense, I believe the film would not have
suffered by presenting a complete view. At the very least, why not
include substantial informative crawls at the beginning and the end of
the story?
The production has a few other problems. After watching the long,
remarkably effective music-free stretch in "Cast Away," I was acutely
aware of the scoring here. When the screen is filled with characters
heatedly discussing the fact that nuclear war could break out at any
time, do we really need orchestral cues to feel tense? I think not. And
why, oh why, does the film periodically shift from color to black and
white?
Speaking of needless affectations, what about Kevin Costner's Boston
accent? The oft-maligned actor told an interviewer, "Luckily, Ken's
accent wasn't as strong as the Kennedys' accent, but I still studied
hard because I know I did a really lousy accent in 'Robin Hood: Prince
of Thieves' and I didn't want to take that kind of heat again."
Apparently, old habits die hard, because, despite his protestations,
Kevin offers a repeat performance. He starts the film with a broad,
metallic accent, then fades into his standard Malibu Ken mode. Sadly,
the brassy Boston accent pops up throughout the film, mostly during
family scenes that were probably shot together early in the production.
Accents aside, Costner does fine work, adjusting his style so that he
doesn't overshadow the principals. As for the lead characters, Steven
Kulp is strong as Bobby Kennedy, projecting a sense of great energy
being contained by propriety, while Bruce Greenwood, neatly underplaying
his role, creates a John F. Kennedy that feels like a real person
instead of a cultural icon. Impressive. The supporting cast is sturdy,
with Michael Fairman a standout as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.
Despite its problems, "Thirteen Days" offers a chilling look at how
close to destruction our world came in 1962. Hopefully, those who
appreciate the film will seek out additional information so they can
learn what happened on the instigator's side of this life and death
chess match as well.

Review for Scream 2 (1997)
Scream 2 (1997)
Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Liev Schreiber, David Arquette, Jamie 
Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett, Jerry O'Connell, Luarie 
Metcalf, Tim Olyphant. Directed by Wes Craven
*** stars (out of *****)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

"I wrote "Scream" to draw attention to itself," said Kevin Williamson in 
a interview earlier this fall. "I sat down and said "All right Kevin, 
stop being an artist, you're unemployed and starving, be a businessman". 
I looked around to see what was missing, what wasn't happening in the 
film market, and decided to take a shot at scary movies. I thought if 
people saw the script they might think I had a voice for something else. 
Then it sold. Who could have dreamed all of this would happen?"
Williamson's basic concept was a great one; a slasher movie populated 
with slasher movie fans who knew all the rules of the genre. No one would 
mistake "Scream" for great art, but the cagey mixture of comedy and 
horror, packed to the hilt with pop culture references, was wildly 
entertaining, and the film blew the roof off of theaters last December. 
"Scream 2" was created quickly, both to capitalize on the success of the 
original and to insure the availability of Williamson, director Wes 
Craven ("A Nightmare On Elm Street") and those actors whose characters 
survived the original film. Like the "Star Trek" movies, "Scream 2" 
operates on the assumption that audiences have seen the original and 
remember who's who. For those who came in late, here's a quick refresher 
course. 
On the anniversary eve of her mother's murder, Sidney Prescott (Neve 
Campbell) is horrified to learn that two of her classmates were brutally 
killed. In short order, she receives a call from the killer, a movie 
freak who taunts her with questions about slasher films. Sidney barely 
survives an assault from the maniac in a ghost mask, then finds herself 
in the center of a media circus. Tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney 
Cox) relentlessly pursues Sidney and her friends, enlisting the aide of 
Deputy Dwight "Dewey" Reilly (David Arquette) in her attempts to get the 
story. Sidney hates Weathers for cashing in on her personal tragedy with 
a book that questioned her mother's morals and challenged Sidney's 
identification of Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) as the man who killed her 
mom. After a night of incredible violence, Sidney learns that Weathers 
was right.
Jump to a year later, as Sidney attends college and tries to put the 
horror behind her. "Scream 2" begins a few blocks from the school, at a 
sneak preview for "Stab," the film based on Gale Weather's book about the 
murders. The unusually generous promoters pass out Ghostface masks, cowls 
and plastic knives to the excited young audience, who have a ball hooting 
at the cheesy horror film (when the "Stab" heroine receives the initial 
call from the killer and panics, an audience member shouts "Bitch, hang 
up and Star 69 his ass!") until a real killing happens right in the 
theater. For Sidney, Dewey (now a security guard at the college,) fellow 
survivor Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Gale Weathers, the nightmare has 
started again.
Williamson and Craven knew exactly what made "Scream" click, and they get 
the same elements cooking here. Sidney is a drama major and Randy is a 
film student, creating a natural context for the requisite movie 
references and in-jokes. "Stab," the film within a film, offers more 
opportunities for pop culture riffing. Luckily, Williamson was smart 
enough not to overdo the humor. There's lots of laughs in "Scream 2," but 
not so many as to undermine the fear factor. In fact, the attacks are 
actually a bit more intense here than in the original, thanks to some 
innovative set pieces. The ingenious opening in a darkened theater, with 
dozens of audience members dressed as Ghostface, delivers just the right 
blend of horror and giggles. An outdoor scene, with the four survivors 
standing together in an large open area as the killer taunts them by cell 
phone, generates real tension. 
The highlight of the film comes as Sidney rehearses a play, surrounded by 
a robed, masked Greek chorus. Scored by Danny Elfman, the sequence 
becomes more and more surreal as Sidney tries in vain to suppress her 
fear amidst the swirling masked figures. Craven's camera work in the 
segment is exceptional, reminiscent of the best classic horror films.
Despite many strong moments, "Scream 2" is slightly less satisfying than 
the original. There are simply too many characters (when the identity of 
a key character is revealed, my first thought was "now which one was he?
") and the climax of the film is convoluted and awkward. Still, winning 
performances (particularly from Arquette and Cox, who create sparks 
together,) some exceptional set pieces, and the sheer ingeniousness of 
the concept keep the franchise afloat. "Scream 2" may be little more than 
cinematic fast-food, but the stuff is still pretty tasty.

Oh, what a difference a Coen brother makes. Or rather, the lack thereof. 
More than anything, "Home Fries" wants to be a black comedy in the vein 
of "Fargo" or "Raising Arizona," but the film lacks Joel and Ethan Coen 
and their skewed sensibilities. The result is a strained, pedestrian 
effort that fires off all its rockets, but never attains escape velocity. 
Despite some nice moments, "Home Fries" remains a flat little curiosity.
Set in Texas, the story revolves around Sally (Drew Barrymore), a sweet, 
sad, very pregnant fast-food cashier at the Burger-Matic. While taking 
drive-through orders one night, she picks up some strange chatter over 
her headset. In fact, she is listening to brothers Angus (Jake Busey) and 
Dorian (Luke Wilson) who, at the behest of their mother (Catherine 
O'Hara), are piloting a helicopter in an attempt to scare the bejesus out 
of their philandering stepfather. The stunt works all too well - - Dad 
has a heart-attack and dies. 
The fatality leaves Mom quite annoyed and the boys very worried: they 
also heard Sally over their headsets and have no idea how much she knows. 
So Dorian takes a job at the burger joint to do some reconnaissance work. 
At this point, you surely can figure out the rest. The dead stepfather is,
 of course, the father of Sally's unborn child. Sally, of course, broke 
things off as soon as she found out he was married and Dorian, of course, 
is destined to fall in love with the comely lass.
Some scenes in "Home Fries" work. When authorities find the corpse 
sitting upright in the middle of nowhere, one cop has his picture taken 
with the body ("I'll go to Hell for this," he chuckles, "but I can't 
resist"). A hostage situation involving Sally's drunk, shotgun-wielding 
hillbilly pappy degenerates into a family squabble that achieves a 
certain Jerry Springer-style absurdist comic rhythm. Unfortunately, these 
are rare successful moments in a black comedy that too often is merely 
gray.
Director Dean Parisot simply lacks the skills to mix irreverent humor and 
a traditional romance. His production feels as half-baked as the romance 
between Sally and Dorian is unconvincing. Never for a moment do you sense 
any chemistry between the two characters. Luke Wilson, who looks a lot 
like Freddie Prinze Jr. with lockjaw, projects a sincere, mildly dazed 
charm, and, as always, the angelic Drew Barrymore is sweet as can be, but 
their characters behave as if they are in two separate movies.
Catherine O'Hara, as the vengeance-obsessed widow, and Jake Busey, as a 
psychotic mama's boy, are more effective, but both suffer from incomplete 
story arcs. Just as their characters near the point in the film where 
their mayhem should reach its manic climax, things wrap up abruptly, 
snuffing the comic payoff. I've no idea whether the choppy resolution of 
their stories is the result of sloppy writing or poor editing, but the 
unfinished feel is quite frustrating.
Frustrating is the best overall word for "Home Fries." You know what the 
filmmakers were shooting for, and, every so often, they actually hit 
their target. But the many near-misses and overall tepid feel just made 
me want to slap a Coen brothers movie in the VCR and watch how the big 
boys do black comedy.

The second spook house movie of 1999, "House on Haunted Hill" is considerably better than "The Haunting." Of course, that's not exactly high praise. "The Haunting" was an inept, leaden mess that served primarily as a showcase for flashy, poorly executed special effects. To make matters worse, it wasn't the slightest bit scary. While far from a success, "House on Haunted Hill" is often frightening and has several scenes that actually deliver the kind of thrills one would expect from the genre. The film starts off strong, only to settle into an all too familiar series of chase scenes, but at least its nasty little heart is in the right place.
The original 1958 "House on Haunted Hill" was a moderately entertaining mix of thrills and high camp, starring Vincent Price and directed by gimmick-king William Castle, who attempted to juice up the proceedings by rigging skeletons to fly through theaters over the heads of viewers. The 1999 "House" works best when remembering its cheesy roots.
It begins with a prologue set decades ago at the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane, where Dr. Vannacutt performed hideous experiments on his captives, until the day when the inmates took over the asylum. Cut to the present, as filthy rich theme park mogul Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) prepares to host a birthday party for his wife Evelyn (Famke Janssen) at the long abandoned facility.
Steven, who distrusts his wife almost as much as she detests him, has set up a number of surprises in the cavernous building, and has substituted his wife's guest list with a different set of names. Unbeknownst to him, the list has been altered yet again, resulting in the arrival of a group unknown to either of the Prices. Surprised but undeterred, Steven lays out the ground rules: each guest will be awarded $1,000,000 if they stay in the house overnight. In the event of death, the money will be split between the survivors. 
Jittery caretaker Pritchett (Chris Kattan) greets the money-hungry partygoers: former pro-baseball player Eddie (Taye Diggs); Sara (Ali Larter), a personal assistant masquerading as her ex-boss; TV talk show host wannabe Melissa Marr (Bridgette Wilson) and Dr. Blackburn (Peter Gallagher).
After the requisite tour of the creepy estate, things begin to go wrong as steel plates slide into place, locking everyone into the joint. With secret cameras hidden throughout the building, Steven initiates his head games, which do not go as planned. He guesses that Evelyn has sabotaged his tricks. Evelyn assumes that everything is part of her husband's ghoulish agenda, and the guests simply want to get out of Dodge.
At first, "House on Haunted Hill" looks like big fun. The prologue is suitably disturbing and a visit to Steven Price's terror-themed amusement park works quite well. The simmering animosity between Mr. and Mrs. Price is juicy and the entire set-up seems as promising as in the original. Unfortunately, the film soon becomes formulaic, jumping from one chase scene to another. Moments of effective horror pop up on a semi-regular basis, but they are not enough to offset the increasingly tedious feel. 
While the sparring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen give saucy performances and Chris Kattan exhibits some flair, the other cast members remain mere archetypes. Within minutes, you figure out who will live and die, and which two characters are destined to become honey bunnies. The frequent swearing does not work in this context, either; it seems too contemporary and mannered, shattering the timeless sense that best serves haunted house movies.
Despite its many problems, "House on Haunted Hill" works as a minor guilty pleasure. Come to think of it, so did the original. Though I doubt it was intentional, the filmmakers managed to recreate the "I know this isn't very good, but I'm still enjoying myself" appeal of the first "House on Haunted Hill." A perverse tribute, but a tribute nonetheless.

For a film like "The Score," the names Robert De Niro, Edward Norton,
Angela Bassett and Marlon Brando are both an asset and a liability. On
the plus side, such a stunning cast is a virtual guarantee that, at the
very least, the acting in the film will be as good as it gets. The
problem is that it's hard to look at that roster and not enter the
theater with unrealistically high expectations.
So is "The Score" an instant classic offering some of the most powerful
ensemble acting ever? No. The film is a sturdy production of a solid, if
unremarkable, caper story. As far as the thespians, this is De Niro and
Norton's show. Brando shares a few scenes with the boys, but his is
merely a supporting role and Angela Bassett, poor Angela Bassett, barely
appears at all. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for
hiring an actor of her caliber and wasting her time with a brief, trite
part.
De Niro anchors the movie with a fine no-nonsense performance and Norton
gets the opportunity to strut his stuff, playing two dynamic characters.
De Niro and Norton make a compelling team, with Brando spicing up the
proceedings as Max, a quirky fence and financier. The story begins as
Max approaches his old friend Nick (De Niro), proposing the theft of a
scepter worth many millions of dollars. The royal staff is secured in
the Montreal Customs House, but Max has an inside man, Jack (Norton),
ready to provide the specs necessary to pull off the robbery.
Nick doesn't want to participate. The caper violates two of his rules:
never pull a heist on your home turf and never work with a partner.
Besides, his dream is to retire from crime and run his elegant jazz club
with Diane (Bassett), the love of his life, at his side, and she will
not commit to him until he goes straight. But the temptation of instant
financial security proves too strong and Nick agrees to do the
proverbial "one last job."
"The Score" looks great. Montreal is a beautiful city with a European
feel and director Frank Oz uses the setting well. He also affords Ed
Norton another attention grabbing dual role. To scope out the Customs
House and win the trust of its employees, Jack takes a janitorial job
under the persona of Brian, a mentally retarded young man. Norton is
smart enough to make Brian a distinct individual rather than a generic
intellectually handicapped person  his Brian is a captivating guy. De
Niro neatly counterbalances Norton's flash and fire. Watching him go
through the mechanics of the heist held my attention even through the
tedious parts because I felt invested in the down-to-earth character.
Brando contributes some playful Sydney Greenstreet-meets-Truman Capote
moments, and, in her very few minutes onscreen, Bassett adds smoke and
substance to the thankless fretful girlfriend role.
I only wish the plot for "The Score" was as strong as its cast. While
there's nothing overtly wrong with the story, there's also nothing fresh
about it. One has to wonder what, besides the opportunity to work with
each other, drew the four actors to such a pedestrian outing. Witnessing
De Niro, Norton, Brando and Bassett act in this film is like watching
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa play softball. You're not sure why they're
doing it, but you wouldn't miss the game for anything.

Author's Note: By my count, Kurt Russell says only 104 words during the 
futuristic fight movie, "Soldier." I'll attempt to do the same in the 
following review.
Russell plays super-soldier trained from birth. Name, blood type and rank 
tattooed on face. Russell looks great, extremely buff. His humanity 
buried by training. New genetically-engineered soldiers, including Jason 
Scott Lee, makes him obsolete. Russell discarded on waste planet. What, 
no recycling? Meets hippie colonists. Stays stoic. Stares at pretty woman,
 saves young boy, gets banished because he scares the hippies. Sits alone,
 tears flow silently in slo-mo. Touching. New soldiers arrive. Russell 
fights them. Many battle scenes, some pretty cool. Movie like long World 
Wrestling Federation match with explosions and cheesy special effects. 
Genetically-engineered soldiers die way too easy. For testosterone freaks 
only.
Postscript: 104 words. Mission accomplished, sir.

"The Negotiator" is one of those films where you can virtually see the 
gears turning in the writers' heads. Having come up with a nifty concept -
- what if two top-notch hostage negotiators faced off against one another 
--  the writers must figure out how to get the characters into their 
proper places, and that's where the film suffers. Plot contrivances, 
overly abrupt attitude changes and awkwardly grafted-on action sequences 
keep this thriller from hitting the bull's eye, although it still 
entertains despite the problem areas.
Shrewd casting helps. Two of the finest actors working today, Samuel L. 
Jackson and Kevin Spacey are masters of intensity. Jackson's specialty is 
creating fiercely intelligent characters with a love of language, while 
Spacey takes a more low-key approach, focusing on droll, erudite types 
who mask their humanity with layers of finely-honed cynicism. What a 
treat to watch them interact in the same film.
Combining elements of "The Fugitive" and "Die Hard," "The Negotiator" 
deals with a very good man in a very bad situation. Danny Roman (Jackson) 
is one of Chicago's best hostage negotiators and a bit of a show-boater. 
After a tense, well-staged opening scene, where he risks his life to 
rescue a little girl held captive by her deranged father, Roman promises 
his recent bride that he'll stop taking such extreme chances and start 
coming home every night for dinner. As any seasoned moviegoer knows, cops 
making statements like that are just begging for trouble.
Sure enough, trouble finds him when his partner, ready to spill the beans 
about departmental embezzlement of retirement funds, is murdered and 
Roman becomes the prime suspect. The film hits an awkward spot here, as 
the department turns against the heroic cop almost instantly. While the 
move is handy for the plot, it just doesn't wash. As a number of real-
life police situations have shown, officers are generally given the 
benefit of doubt within the department even when their misdeeds are 
witnessed by many. The idea that Roman's fellow officers, knowing what 
kind of man he is, would turn against him based solely on shaky 
circumstantial evidence is patently unbelievable.
Realizing that his life is about to be destroyed by a lazy plot device, 
Roman makes a desperate move, taking hostages in the 20th floor Internal 
Affairs office. As a "Dog Day Afternoon" street scene develops, Roman 
insists he'll only speak with Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top hostage 
negotiator from a different precinct. Roman's logic is clear. Since any 
of the officers he knows could be involved in the embezzlement scheme and 
murder, the only chance he has of getting to the truth is by dealing with 
an outsider. But can he get Sabian to believe him and become an ally 
instead of an adversary?
"The Negotiator" works best during its middle section, as the mind-games 
between Roman, Sabian and the rest of the force are in full flower. 
Jackson gets the lion's share of the good scenes, tersely explaining 
Hostage Negotiation 101 to a patrolman trying to talk him down, and 
making Internal Affairs Inspector Niebaum (the late J.T. Walsh) sweat as 
he interrogates him while explaining how he can tell whether or not a man 
is lying simply by observing his eye movements.
Spacey has a ball as the tightly-wound Sabian, attempting to maintain a 
modicum of cool while trying to outthink both Roman and a lot of trigger-
happy cops. Spacey's dark eyes radiate a keen intellect that enhances the 
palpable tension propelling the story. 
As entertaining as Jackson and Spacey are, their characters would have 
been more involving had they been given some shading. Each actor 
establishes a tone for his character and essentially stays there for the 
entire film. Roman and Sabian are dynamic, but they seem defined solely 
by the film's extreme situation. Some insight on how these men became the 
way they are would have helped broaden the characters.
Two of the supporting hostages make a strong impression. The always 
entertaining Paul Giamatti is a hoot playing a snitch with a fatalistic 
loosey-goosey attitude, and Siobahn Fallon, the peculiar farm wife from 
"Men in Black," is fascinating as a secretary whose loyalties are 
maddeningly uncertain.
Of course, when dealing with a high-concept storyline, you have to figure 
out how to resolve the situation, and "The Negotiator" falters in this 
department, with plot contrivances and standard-issue action scenes 
diminishing the tension so carefully established before. Some major 
revelations are telegraphed earlier in the film, making the big surprises 
not all that surprising.
Despite its flaws, "The Negotiator" succeeds more than it fails, 
maintaining a satisfying level of tension for most of the film and 
providing a strong showcase for the contrasting acting styles of Jackson 
and Spacey. Had the filmmakers been as careful with the script as they 
were with the casting, this could have been a real beaut.

John Travolta, Andie Mac Dowell, William Hurt, Robert Pastorelli, Bob 
Hoskins, Jean Stapleton, Teri Garr, Wally Ward, Joey Lauren Adams, Carla 
Gugino, Tom Hodges, Wallace Langham. Directed by Nora Ephron.
Rated PG, *** stars (out of ***** stars)
John Travolta makes his first appearance as the archangel Michael  
wearing nothing but boxer shorts. The eyes focus on his large belly as he 
tromps to the kitchen, cigarette in hand, in search of a beer. Asked how 
he went about gaining weight for the role, Travolta explained that he 
didn't. He's willing to try and lose weight for a movie, but never gain 
it. He just happened to be fat when it came time to make this film. That 
simple honesty is part of John Travolta's charm, and part of the charm of 
"Michael," Nora Ephron's sweet romantic comedy.
In "Michael", Chicago-based tabloid reporters William Hurt, Robert 
Pastorelli, and Andie MacDowell travel to Iowa to get the story on an 
alleged angel. There they meet Jean Stapleton, the crusty owner of a run-
down motel, and her only tenant, a self-indulgent slob with very real 
wings. The stunned trio cut a deal with Michael - - he'll go with them 
and allow himself to be photographed once they arrive, but only if they 
make the trip to Chicago by car (he's anxious to see the world's largest 
ball of twine and other tourist attractions). And so the road trip begins.
The structure and details of "Michael" seem terminally cute on paper. 
Hurt is a world weary cynic, MacDowell is deadly earnest, Pastorelli is 
funny and a bit slow. Care to guess which characters will fall in love? 
The reporters are suspicious of their self-indulgent homily-spouting 
charge. Will they come to believe that Michael is really an angel and not 
just a genetic freak? Will they come to believe in his message of wonder? 
Don't think to hard on these questions.
The charm in "Michael" lies not in the cliched story, but in the 
performances of the powerhouse cast. William Hurt is a phenomenal actor 
whose ability to convey intelligence, directness and dry, acerbic line 
readings is unmatched.  What other actor could deliver a stilted line 
like "Don't say this was a mistake, I couldn't bear it" and make it sound 
real? Andie MacDowell has made a career of being a walking contradiction. 
She is an achingly beautiful woman who manages to somehow also look like 
"just plain folks." She appears bright and naive at the same time. 
MacDowell uses her skills to great effect as a reporter who is also an 
aspiring country songwriter, enduring much teasing from Hurt over her 
homespun lyrics. In one magical scene, she sings her "work in progress" 
at a honky-tonk bar. Her voice and facial expressions as she delivers the 
song's clunky, but true, lyrics provide one of the most graceful and 
elegant moments in the movie. And Pastorelli, "Eldon" from "Murphy Brown,
" does a fine job as a crusty innocent, although his character is 
tragically underused.
And then there's John Travolta, an amazing actor. Since his comeback in 
"Pulp Fiction," Travolta has selected his roles in an astute and 
audacious fashion. In "Michael," he gives one of his most winsome 
performances yet. After casting Lucifer out of Heaven, Michael has came 
to Earth many times. This is his last visit ("they only let you come down 
so many times") and he intends to wring every drop of hedonistic pleasure 
from it. In addition to his passion for food, drink and cigarettes, 
Michael loves women. His touch is magical, and his scent acts as an 
aphrodisiac (MacDowell explains, "He smells like cookies. It gets 
stronger when he's in heat".) Whether delivering greeting card wisdom or 
engaging in battle, Travolta makes the character work by conveying a 
great sense of self-comfort. Totally at peace with himself, he holds 
court effortlessly and effectively. When he urges the others to "listen 
to the Earth," his inflection makes the great truth behind the statement 
quite clear. Travolta's keen sense of wonder is contagious. Despite the 
cheesy plot and dialogue that ranges from inspired to insipid, the 
extraordinary performances by Travolta and company leave the audience 
feeling happy and very much alive.

"Small Time Crooks" is a funny little movie, which, considering the key
people involved in the project, comes as a bit of a surprise. It's been
a long time since I've associated writer/director/star Woody Allen's
name with anything other than a vague sense of creepiness. As for
co-star Tracey Ullman, while fans trumpet her versatility, I've long
found her brash, loosey-goosey affect rather cringeworthy as well. Yet
here they are; bickering like "The Honeymooners" in a comedy which
delivers a steady stream of chuckles.
Allen plays Ray Winkler, a schlubby middle-aged ex-con with a "great new
plan." Seems there's a recently vacated pizzeria a few doors down from a
bank. Ray will set up a cover business in the storefront, with wife
Frenchy (Ullman) selling her homemade cookies. Meanwhile, he and his
buddies (Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, all sorely
underused here), will work in the basement, digging a tunnel to the bank
vault. Badda bing, badda boom, instant riches!
The scheme, of course, is a complete disaster, but Frenchy's cookies
become incredibly popular with New Yorkers. In a relatively short period
of time, the couple find themselves running a wildly successful national
franchise and the Winklers move on up to the Eastside, to a deluxe
apartment in the sky. While Ray is content living his usual life;
watching TV in his underwear and eating his wife's spaghetti and turkey
meatballs, Frenchy has lofty goals. She wants to become a refined member
of the social elite, even if means hiring smarmy art dealer David (Hugh
Grant) as her cultural tutor.
It's a simple concept  Ralph and Alice Kramden as the "Beverly
Hillbillies"  but it works. Woody Allen is the weakest part of the
equation, bitching and moaning in his usual fashion, but Tracey Ullman
picks up the story and strolls away with it, creating a solid,
sympathetic persona and building outward from there. Frenchy has a tart
tongue and tough mannerisms, but is remarkably susceptible to a few kind
words. Ullman imbues the character with a sense of cracked strength that
makes her vulnerability all the more engaging.
But, as good as Ullman is, Elaine May steals the movie handily as May,
Frenchy's cousin brought in to help with the cookie store scam.
Blissfully unaware that the business is just a front, May chatters
incessantly, always saying the perfect wrong thing at the perfect wrong
time. The veteran comic carries ditziness to a new plateau; May walks
among us, but lives in a completely different universe, a dreamy pastel
place filled with lounge music and stuffed animals. Elaine May takes the
simplest gesture and makes it hilarious  even if you detest Woody Allen
and Tracey Ullman, "Small Time Crooks" would be worth a visit for her
work alone.

"I can appreciate the theatrical value of several dead kids," muses 
personal injury lawyer Jan Schlictmann (John Travolta) early in the legal 
thriller, "A Civil Action." To its credit, the film, based on Jonathan 
Harr's nonfiction bestseller, carefully avoids exploiting the death of 
those children. In fact, the production successfully navigates around 
most of the rampant emotional manipulation and storytelling clichés that 
fuel so many courtroom dramas. Unfortunately, in their determination to 
recount a complicated series of events accurately and without emotional 
button-pushing, the filmmakers undercut the inherent drama of their own 
story. "A Civil Action" is admirable and quite interesting, but not 
nearly as compelling as it should be.
Set in the '80s in Woburn, Massachusetts, the case revolves around eight 
families who lost children to leukemia. Believing that chemical dumping 
by two local factories tainted the town's water supply and led to the 
deaths, Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan), mother of one of the children, 
approaches Schlichtmann on behalf of the parents. She is adamant that the 
families are not interested in wealth - - they simply want an apology 
from the responsible parties. 
With well-rehearsed compassionate tones, Schlichtmann explains that, 
while he feels her pain, his firm is small enough that they cannot afford 
to lose a case. As a courtesy, he makes a cursory investigation of the 
site, only to discover that the factories in question are owned by two 
giant corporations, W.R. Grace & Co. and Beatrice Foods. With dollar 
signs in his eyes, Schlichtmann does an about-face and convinces his 
partners to devote their full resources to the case, leading him to face 
off against William Cheeseman (Bruce Norris), W.R. Grace's self-important,
 boobish head lawyer, and Beatrice attorney Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall),
 a much craftier, formidable foe.
Writer/director Steven Zaillian does a nice job of compressing a very 
complex true story into a manageable package. A series of well-staged 
deposition scenes lay out the particulars of the case, while voice-overs 
and sharp editing effectively detail the legal tactics. Early on, we 
learn that in the world of personal injury law, settling out of court 
means everything. Only 1.5% of the cases ever reach a verdict, and, out 
of those, the result is two to one against the plaintiff. 
For the most part, "A Civil Action" minimizes the human factor of the 
tragedy, focusing instead on the high-stakes pissing war between the 
lawyers. Schlichtmann becomes obsessed on extracting as much money from 
the corporations as possible, turning down huge proposed settlements 
because the figures were offered too easily. His primary motive may be 
greed exacerbated by wounded pride, or he might be honestly trying to 
serve the families, recognizing that a soulless corporation understands 
only money, and a severe financial penalty is the closest thing to an 
apology his clients will ever receive.
What's actually going on in Schlichtmann's head is anybody's guess, 
because the film provides scant insight into the man. As always, John 
Travolta is a commanding presence, but he doesn't seem to have a handle 
on the character. One thing is clear - - Schlichtmann's skills do not 
match his zeal. The further he gets into the case, the more clumsy he 
becomes. One of the film's most striking passages shows Facher telling a 
law class about tactical mistakes often made in the courtroom, while the 
camera cuts to images of Schlichtmann making those very errors. 
As Facher, the amazing Robert Duvall is ornery and assured, although his 
overabundant display of colorful eccentricities borders on showboating. 
He sticks out even more in comparison to the rest of the central players, 
a numbing group of one-note characters. Only a few supporting cast 
members manage to flesh out their roles. James Gandolfini is excellent as 
a Grace employee giving his deposition under the watchful eyes of the 
corporate attorneys, using subtle changes in expression to efficiently 
convey the sense of a man of conscience who has selected this moment to 
rebel against a lifetime of silent intimidation. 
And while Kathleen Quinlan's character serves only as a symbol of 
parental grief, David Thornton does wonders with his few onscreen moments,
 displaying restraint and quiet dignity as he relates his desperate 
failed attempts to revive his son, who stopped breathing during the drive 
to the hospital. There is no bathos in the scene; just unadorned, 
heartbreaking human grief.
A little more humanity would have done wonders for this film. The 
lawyers' posturing, planning and maneuvering is fascinating, but with the 
human factor pushed so far into the background, the production turns into 
a clinical, ultimately anticlimactic exercise. Fair to a fault, "A Civil 
Action" is too civil to leave a lasting impression.

After scanning a rave review of "Eye of the Beholder," I went to a press
screening of the psychological thriller with high hopes. An hour and 50
minutes later, while the closing credits rolled, I sat shaking my head
as a fellow critic turned to me and said, "What in the hell was all that
about?!?" Following an intriguing start, "Eye of the Beholder" soon
deteriorates into an incomprehensible mess, and a pretentious one to
boot. "The Sixth Sense" featured a somber child who chilled audiences by
saying, "I see dead people." There's a somber child in this movie as
well, one who was probably thinking, "I see a dead script."
The film, which stars Ashley Judd as a serial killer and Ewan McGregor
as an obsessed surveillance expert, was shot well before the two actors
achieved mainstream success in, respectively, "Double Jeopardy" and
"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace." Released now to exploit their fame,
word of mouth will likely insure a quick fade for the noir flick,
despite the inclusion of a nude scene from the extremely attractive
Judd. At least the producers were thoughtful enough to place that
segment at the beginning of the film, so when it hits cable, those who
want to see Ashley naked can do so without having to suffer through much
of the story.
Based on the acclaimed 1980 novel by Marc Behm, "Eye of the Beholder"
follows a British Secret Service agent called The Eye (McGregor) as he
investigates the possible blackmail of his employer's son. While spying
on the young man, he watches in horror as Joanna Eris (Judd) hacks up
the guy with a butcher knife. Instead of calling the cops, he follows
her from city to city like a lovestruck puppy as she turns more
unsuspecting men into sushi.
Why? Well, apparently it's some sort of Jerry Springer deal where one
incredibly fucked-up person finds another incredibly fucked-up person
irresistible. You see, after each slaughter, Joanna screams about her
daddy, who deserted her when she was a child. The Eye can relate; years
ago, his wife took their young daughter and left, frustrated over his
obsession with work. In fact, The Eye often sees visions of his
daughter, occasionally two at once. Interestingly enough, while he does
chat with the hallucinations from time to time, he remains preoccupied
with business. So much for learning from your mistakes.
He is able, however, to devote his full attention to Joanna. After all,
what inexpressive guy who lost his family wouldn't get the hots for a
man-slashing nut case? It's a love connection!
Things were different in the book. The Eye was a middle-aged man who
followed Joanna because he believed she might actually be his long lost
daughter. But writer/director Stephan Elliot ("The Adventures of
Priscilla: Queen of the Desert") didn't want to waste his time with
something as pedestrian as a faithful adaptation of the source material.
Instead, he takes out his Crayola and creates the kind of weird-ass
trifle David Lynch might have done in grammar school. For scene
transitions, he zooms in on snow globes depicting the next locale. The
effect is engaging at first, but he repeats it for the entire film.
After the sixth or seventh snow globe, I was ready to take an ax to the
nearest souvenir stand.
Elliot desperately wants to be Alfred Hitchcock, but he can't even pull
off a decent Brian De Palma. From the ham-handed visual underscoring of
his "guardian angel" theme to a "Look! I saw 'Vertigo!'" scene in a bell
tower, Elliot directs with the finesse of Homer Simpson at an
all-you-can-eat pork chop dinner.
Somehow, Ashley Judd comes through it all relatively unscathed. Despite
being forced to sport a variety of bad wigs and shriek her motivations
with each new murder, she still imbues Joanna with a degree of depth
beyond anything in Elliot's murky screenplay. And, although the insular
nature of his character gives him little room to move, Ewan McGregor
deserves credit just for keeping a straight face through this nonsense,
especially when his character must play super sleuth while wearing an
attention-getting bright red jacket.
After the "Eye of the Beholder" screening, I expressed relief to my
colleague that I would have a few days to process what I'd seen. After
considerable reflection, I've come to the conclusion that there is
little to process. "Eye of the Beholder" wants to be an art film and a
thriller. It fails at both aspirations. If you'll pardon the expression,
there is far less here than meets the eye.

For the benefit of curious parents, let's get the formalities out of the 
way. Your kids will have all ball at Disney's "Mulan." Packed with action 
and humor, the film is imaginative, fun and fast-paced, presenting a 
strong tale of female empowerment while imparting a positive message 
about the importance of being true to yourself. 
On the surface level, the film succeeds as fine light entertainment for 
adults as well. The disposable pop songs are mercifully short and few in 
number and the animation is striking, particularly in a majestic scene 
showing hundreds of warriors racing down a mountain slope. Too often, 
computer animation sticks out like a sore thumb when placed in the 
context of a traditionally animated film. Here, the CGI is beautifully 
integrated in a number of scenes that dazzle the eyes with a wealth of 
visual information.
Disney magic aside, "Mulan" is even more interesting when you examine 
what's going on under the surface. Remember all the raised eyebrows last 
year when Eddie Murphy was stopped by sheriffs while giving a ride to a 
transsexual hooker? The motives for his good Samaritan act were 
questioned at the time, but now everything is clear. Eddie was just doing 
research for his role in "Mulan", the first animated cross-dressing 
musical. 
Murphy provides the voice for Mushu, a wise-cracking guardian dragon who 
accompanies our heroine on her adventures. When marauding Huns attack 
ancient China, the government calls for one man from every family to join 
the Imperial Army. Despite his age and physical limitations, Mulan's 
father prepares to go. She objects, only to be told "I know my place. It 
is time you learn yours." Undeterred, the spirited girl lops off her hair,
 dons her father's battle gear and takes off in his place, masquerading 
as a man. Of course, Disney cartoons require comic sidekicks and Mulan 
gets two; a good-luck cricket and Murphy's dragon, who offers advice and 
assistance as the fledgling warrior trains at boot camp for war. 
"Mulan's" humor has a decidedly gay sensibility, with Murphy providing 
one-liners like "I'm doomed! And all because Miss Man decided to take her 
drag show on the road!" Murphy delivers his lines with the kind of 
distinct snap most often associated with gay camp humor. The drag theme 
continues throughout the film, as three of Mulan's bumbling fellow 
soldiers (including the gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein) dress as women to 
infiltrate an enemy stronghold. In geisha drag, the trio throw themselves 
completely into their roles, with a funny mix of slapstick and high camp. 
Hetero audiences may view the scenes as mere farce, but gay viewers will 
know better. Tellingly, the only soldier who doesn't do drag is the 
troop's captain, a hunky leader who spends a good deal of the story with 
his shirt off. 
The film wanders into the Tim Allen approach to gender stereotypes, with 
Mulan's attempts to impersonate a male coming straight from the "men are 
pigs" line of thought. At the urging of her dragon advisor, she spits, 
grunts and gives the other soldiers friendly punches to the arm and slaps 
on the butt. Thankfully, the story doesn't waste much time on this 
overdone line of shtick.
Spirituality plays a role in "Mulan," with four prayer scenes featured 
early in the story. Had the film been set in the Western world, it's 
unlikely that any religious references would have been made, but to many 
contemporary Americans, Eastern faiths are picturesque, exotic and even 
trendy, which makes their inclusion acceptable. In pop culture, religion 
is okay only if it's trippy and several thousand miles away. As if to 
underscore the point, Murphy's character does a mocking impression of a 
Christian evangelist in one funny scene.
In fairness, even the Eastern beliefs receive a bit of tweaking, with 
Mulan's revered ancestors presented as comically bickering ghosts. This 
fits neatly with Disney's Epcot take on Chinese culture, used as an 
attractive motif, but with about as much authenticity as the China 
pavilion at Orlando's World Showcase. While the animation springs from 
the "less is more" school of Chinese art, the Mouseketeers give it a 
Western spin, with fast, swooping movements from the broadly drawn 
secondary characters.
Despite Disney's trademarked candy-coated Americanization of foreign 
cultures, the film still succeeds, thanks to its sense of style, some 
very nice animation and a simple, but genuinely strong story. Young Mulan 
fails when trying to adopt the mannerisms of traditional Chinese women 
and fumbles when pretending to be a man. Only when she ignores societal 
expectations and uses her innate wit and strength of character does she 
succeed. That's a good message and "Mulan" is a good movie. Join the kids 
and whoop during the battle scenes or sit back and evaluate the subtext. 
Either way, you're going to have fun.

Imagine a reverse spin on "The Exorcist," all trussed up with MTV-style 
graphics, and you'll have a fair idea of what to expect from "Stigmata," 
an overwrought horror story burdened by sluggish pacing, a lame 
screenplay with a distinct lack of internal logic and an insufferable 
soundtrack. Despite its laundry list of flaws, I still got caught up in 
the story, which appeared to be building towards a climax that would make 
some profound statement, only to watch the film deflate like a cheap air 
mattress with a faulty stem. For all its posturing, "Stigmata" is much 
bloody ado about nothing.
It begins in a tiny village, where Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) 
investigates reports of a religious statue that bleeds profusely. Father 
Kiernan, who travels the world serving as a sort-of miracle cop for the 
Vatican, remains remarkably subdued even when the statue weeps bloody 
tears. When the phenomena reoccurs, accompanied by birds flying through 
the church and great bursts of wind blowing out the chapel candles, which 
spontaneously re-ignite around 30 seconds later, the padre is suitably 
impressed and reports his findings to the big boys in Rome. His boss, the 
creepy Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), merely glowers and instructs 
him to pack up the statue and have it sent to the church labs for study. 
Cut to Pittsburgh, where hairdresser Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) 
has her own set of troubles. After her mother sends her a rosary stolen 
from the body of the priest from the aforementioned church, Frankie 
experiences bizarre attacks where she spontaneously bleeds from her hands,
 head or feet. Not only are the occurrences terrifying and painful, but 
the red clashes with her trendy outfits. Doctors can't determine why this 
is happening, frustrating the hip young atheist even more. To make 
matters worse, Frankie's boyfriend Steven (Patrick Muldoon) begins to 
distance himself from her and even her girlfriends Donna (Nia Long) and 
Jennifer (Portia de Rossi) start looking at her as if she was Linda Blair.
Enter Father Kiernan, who explains the situation to Frankie. Stigmata is 
the appearance of wounds on a body in the five exact places where the 
crucified Christ was pierced. Those who experience stigmata are deeply 
religious people, like Saint Francis of Assisi, who lost a pint a day, 
according to the Father. He fears for Frankie, because no one except her 
has ever displayed more than two of the wounds at the same time. If she 
simultaneously shows all five, the result may be death. 
A number of questions arise at this point. Even with magic rosary beads, 
why is an atheist experiencing a phenomena that affects only the 
extremely faithful? Why do those who witness this full-fledged miracle 
react solely with horror instead of wonder? Where are the cops and the 
media when Frankie runs into the street and causes a series of car wrecks?
 Why are her attacks scored with annoying music from Smashing Pumpkins 
leader Billy Corgan? How does a hairdresser afford the largest apartment 
in Pittsburgh? And what the hell is an actor of Gabriel Byrne's caliber 
doing in a cheesy movie like this?
The prime subplot of "Stigmata" is far more interesting than all the 
"Exorcist" histrionics, but it turns out to be both anticlimactic and 
illogical. (SPOILER ALERT: the following reveals significant plot points) 
Cardinal Houseman and his cohorts strive to stifle Father Kiernan's 
investigation. It seems that there exists another gospel, written by 
Christ himself. Certain Catholics, including the late priest from the 
little church, were close to revealing the writings and the Vatican 
baddies fear that Christ's message would destroy their lucrative 
organization. 
While intriguing, the subplot has two big problems. First, an elderly 
priest (Rade Serbedgia) who specializes in translations repeatedly states 
that the first-hand gospel has been lost forever, even though he holds 
sharp photographs of the scriptures in his hand. Second, when we finally 
hear the legendary message, it turns out to be a benign truism that most 
of us learned on the first day of Bible school. Is this simple message a 
threat to the very existence of the Catholic Church? I don't think so 
(END SPOILERS).
So we are left with a lurid horror show, edited in quick-cut MTV style 
and surrounded by quasi-alternative music. One of the reasons "The Sixth 
Sense" worked is because the filmmakers understood that the extraordinary 
is most effectively presented in a low-key fashion. "Stigmata" takes 
miracles and turns them into grandiose music videos, and while a few 
moments are genuinely disturbing, the bulk of the film plays like a big, 
dumb trip through an ecclesiastical spook house.

Review for He Got Game (1998)
He Got Game (1998)

 Written and directed by Spike Lee. 131 minutes.
R, 3 stars (out of five stars)

The tagline for Spike Lee's latest drama is "The Father, the Son and the 
Holy Game." The lead character's name is Jesus and they don't use the 
Spanish pronunciation. Although the story is set largely in impoverished 
areas, the Coney Island backdrops, packed with colorful storefronts, 
amusement park rides and acres of neon, give the film a romantic look of 
seedy grandeur. Aaron Copland's rich, melodramatic orchestral score is 
reminiscent of the music from films like "Rebel Without A Cause." Even 
the pop songs, by the reunited Public Enemy, are unusually somber and 
understated. It's clear that Lee intends this film to be far more than 
just another movie about sports and father/son conflicts. His goal is to 
make "He Got Game" a classic. 
Unfortunately, while Lee has crafted a film that looks and sounds 
terrific, he fails to make the central storyline as compelling. A week 
after seeing "He Got Game," the sounds and images still resonate in my 
memory, but the people don't. Populated with too many characters who are 
sketchy or unsympathetic, and burdened with a flat performance from first-
time actor Ray Allen, "He Got Game" narrowly misses making the all-
important human connection. The result is still a good film, but not the 
great one it could have been.
The story is straightforward enough. Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel 
Washington,) serving a lengthy prison sentence for killing his wife, 
receives a offer from the warden. Jake's son Jesus (Allen) is the top 
high school basketball player in America and everyone wants a piece of 
what could be the next Michael Jordan. Resisting the lure of joining the 
NBA and gaining immediate wealth, the young athlete is determined to 
attend college, and has only a few days to choose from the hundreds of 
scholarships being offered him. The governor wants Jesus to attend his 
alma mater, Big State, and relays his proposition through the warden. 
Jake will be temporarily paroled, under the scrutiny of two officers. If 
he can convince his son to sign a letter of intent for Big State, Jake's 
sentence will be commuted. If not, it's back to the slammer for Dad. Of 
course, Jesus loathes Jake, so the task won't be an easy one.
"He Got Game" has two dominant themes; the exploitation of student 
athletes, and the estranged relationship between father and son. Both 
have been dealt with many times before, but if handled correctly, even 
the most well-worn themes can seem fresh. Of the two, Lee does better 
with the former than the latter. Jesus is virtually smothered by people 
who want to feed off his talent and suffers great stress from the 
pressure. While everyone from his uncle to his girlfriend angle for their 
piece of the pie, the media has already made the kid a star. Lee is a 
major basketball fan, and his commercials for sports shoes have made him 
richer than his movies, so he knows this world well. His portrait of 
sports stars as false gods is painted in broad strokes, but it works, 
thanks to Lee's great style. Highlights include a hilarious cameo from 
John Turturro as a college coach trying to woo the young man with an over-
the-top multimedia pitch, and a gaudy ESPN documentary called "Jesus of 
Coney Island." Subtle? No. Effective? Yes. To add authenticity, Lee 
peppers the film liberally with cameos from everybody from Reggie Miller 
to Michael Jordan.
The film's many basketball scenes are quite believable, because Lee hired 
the real deal to do the job. Jesus' high school teammates are played by 
Travis Best of the Pacers, John Wallace of the Raptors, Walter McCarty of 
the Celtics and Rick Fox of the Lakers. Unfortunately, Lee also cast a 
real basketball player in the lead role. Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks 
plays Jesus and as an actor, well, Allen is a great ballplayer. 
Denzel Washington, who generally has trouble playing anyone other than a 
boy scout, is very effective as Jesus' father, a frustrated ballplayer 
who drove his son mercilessly, severely damaging the relationship with 
his boy long before the fateful incident with his wife. Washington gives 
a credible, layered performance that triumphs over the script's rough 
spots, even a superfluous subplot involving a battered hooker ("The Fifth 
Element's" Milla Jovovich,) but there's only so much he can do while 
working with an amateur. Allen's monotone performance lessens the impact 
of even the most dramatic scenes between father and son. 
The lack of well-rounded or sympathetic supporting players doesn't help 
the film, and casting Allen was a critical mistake, but not a fatal one. 
Despite its problems, "He Got Game" has tremendous style and a fair 
amount of substance. Not enough to make the film a classic, but more than 
enough to warrant a viewing.

At first, "Kiss of the Dragon" had me. The action film, co-scripted by
Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita," "The Fifth Element") and Robert Mark
Kamen from a story by star Jet Li, quickly established itself as a
grisly, single-minded, hard-core martial arts comic book, with fighting,
fighting and more fighting. Fair enough, sounds good. But as the minutes
ticked by, the whole thing grew tiresome. After it became obvious that
Jet Li's character was absolutely unstoppable, the tension faded away. I
looked for something else to occupy my attention, but there simply was
nothing else there.
Jet Li plays Liu Jian, China's top cop, sent from Beijing to Paris to
assist local officers in protecting an important Chinese citizen. In
addition to being a martial arts master, Liu also has a way with
acupuncture needles. He can use them to make someone relax, paralyze a
foe or execute a move called "Kiss of the Dragon," which causes the
recipient to bleed from all orifices and die a particularly painful
death. God, this guy would be such a hit in Texas.
Things turn sour for Liu when the man he is supposed to protect is
murdered by the police officers he is supposed to work with. Inspector
Richard (Tcheky Karyo), the ringleader of the gang, frames Liu for the
killing, forcing Liu to hide in the red light district while trying to
sort things out. Along the way, he meets Jessica (Bridget Fonda) a North
Dakota mother, hooker and recovering junkie. Well, almost recovering.
Periodically, her pimp forcibly injects her with drugs to keep her
compliant, although that shouldn't be much of a problem, since he is
also holding her daughter hostage. And who is this horrible, horrible
man? Inspector Richard, of course.
Liu is presented as a man focused on his work to the exclusion of all
else. Aside from rage, he shows little emotion, save for one scene where
Jessica pokes into his personal life. "Are you married?" she asks. "No."
"Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." "Are you gay?" Finally, we see a spark
of emotion  panic  as he quickly replies, "No, I am not gay. I am NOT
gay." OK, so it appears Liu has no sexual relationships in his life.
Hmmm. Perhaps there are some other tricks he can do with his magic
needles.
Leaping from one seedy location to the next, "Kiss of the Dragon" keeps
the action churning, with each new battle more absurd than the last. One
takes place on a passenger-packed boat, with bad cops firing automatic
weapons in all directions. The scene is great eye candy, but it made me
wonder where the city's other police officers were during the shooting
spree. Are all of them corrupt or did Inspector Richard assign them to
work in the suburbs for the day?
Who knows and who cares? With a hammy performance by Karyo, a flat
performance from Fonda and a non-performance from Jet Li, "Kiss of the
Dragon" cares not a whit about logic or personality. This is simply an
exercise in hyper-violent showboating, a nihilistically pure look at
impurity.

with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Judging by its weak opening weekend box office numbers, it appears
that most filmgoers have little interest in "Anywhere But Here."
That's a shame, because this sharply observed look at the dynamics
between a mother and daughter, based on the novel by Mona Simpson, is
a nice piece of work. Director Wayne Wang ("Smoke," "The Joy Luck
Club") has a gift for character studies and the script provides him
with two very interesting characters. Add superb acting from Susan
Sarandon and Natalie Portman to the mix and you end up with an above
average production that certainly warrants a visit.
At first glance, the premise has a strong "been there, done that"
feel. Sarandon plays Adele August, a flamboyant woman who spirits her
teenage daughter Ann (Portman) away from their home in Bay City,
Wisconsin to seek out a better life in Beverly Hills. Adele views her
actions as noble and brave, while Ann simmers over essentially being
kidnapped by her self-absorbed, overbearing mother. If that sounds
familiar well, it is, but there's a lot more going on beneath the
surface.
First off, there's Adele, who desperately wants to be stylish and
larger than life. She longs to be Thelma and Louise, Holly Golightly
and Auntie Mame put together, but the twist is that she really isn't
very good at it. For all of her theatrical flourishes, Adele is full
of fear: fear of aging, of losing her daughter, of facing a loveless
future, of being ordinary. She masks her terror with impulsive
actions, using glib one-liners as a way of whistling in the dark.
Susan Sarandon is wonderful, using those big eyes and cracked beauty
to express Adele's near-perpetual state of quiet panic. A role like
this is especially difficult; for the soufflé to work, the
character must be over-dramatic, but the actor dare not
overact. Sarandon proves up to the challenge, giving a performance so
good that it almost makes up for her appearance in last year's
insufferably mawkish "Stepmom."
Months after being buried under thick makeup and royal drapings in
"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace," Natalie Portman gets to stretch out
here, reminding us that she is one of the finest actors of her
generation. In the hands of a lesser talent, Ann could easily have
been just a sulky teen, but Portman greatly shades her character. As
angry as she is over being uprooted from family and friends, Ann still
needs her mother as much as Adele needs her. For most of the film, the
characters live in a steady state of role reversal. While Adele has
the authority, she is often more childish than Ann, leaving her
daughter to serve as surrogate mother. The flip-flop works because
Portman and Sarandon are smart enough to play it close to the vest.
Although the film is mostly a two-character drama, a few supporting
players stand out. Shawn Hatosy ("Outside Providence") is a delight as
Ann's cousin and best friend, a young man who is still clearly a kid,
although the stirrings of manhood are strong enough to throw him off
balance. Michael Milhoan has a couple of nice scenes as a paternal
traffic cop, and Corbin Allred projects wide-eyed charm as a classmate
smitten with Ann.
"Anywhere But Here" tries to keep the proceedings relatively light,
but some of its best moments are quite serious. When a
relationship-starved Adele presses too hard and scares off a potential
boyfriend after a one-night stand, her pain is amplified by the
expressions on Ann's face as she watches her mother's dreams once
again sabotaged by her own excess.
Another striking scene comes when Adele sneaks a look at her
daughter's theater audition. Ann is interested in college, not acting,
but finally succumbs to her mother's pressure for her to enter show
business. When Adele peeks in the door, she witnesses her daughter
doing a dead-on perfect impression of her, and the look on Sarandon's
face is devastating.
"Anywhere But Here" is far from perfect. The incessant squabbling
between Adele and Ann grows tedious and the ending of the film, while
emotionally satisfying, seems a little too pat when compared to the
rest of the story. But this mother-daughter portrait, coupled with an
illuminating glimpse at parental motives, rises handily above its
deficits. "Anywhere But Here" is a strong little movie that deserves
not to get lost in the box office shuffle.

Grand Prix winner at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, "Life Is 
Beautiful" offers ample rewards to those viewers willing to submit to 
the peculiar vision of writer, director and star Roberto Benigni. The 
Italian artist has crafted an often lyrical light romance that 
abruptly transforms into a deeply moving tale of survival. Despite 
the film's radical shift in tone, Benigni's message never wavers: 
life is beautiful if you make it so. While we cannot always control 
the circumstances around us, we can govern our individual responses. 
Each person has the capacity to create his or her own internal 
reality. It's just a matter of willpower.
The film, in Italian with English subtitles, begins as a romantic 
farce. Guido (Benigni) is a Jewish drifter who stumbles through 1939 
Fascist Italy, using his wits and clownish charm to get by. When told 
of a philosopher's belief in the strength of human will, Guido takes 
the remarks literally and begins to practice "willing" things to 
happen. In short order, he successfully courts the beautiful Dora 
(Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life spouse) and builds a thriving 
business and happy life for his family, blissfully ignoring the 
growing anti-Semitism around them.
Then in 1945, the final days of World War II, authorities take Guido 
and his five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) into custody, 
herding them onto a train bound for a concentration camp. When Dora 
hears the news, she races to the train station and insists that she 
be put onboard as well. Even though she is not Jewish, Dora refuses 
to leave her family. 
At the camp, Guido concocts a story to shield his son from the 
horrific reality around them. He tells Giosue that it's all an 
elaborate game. The goal is to accumulate 1000 points. Giosue's eyes 
widen as he hears of the prize; a real tank, ever so much better than 
the toy he used to play with. The child listens intently as his 
father explains the mechanics of the game. The men in uniform will 
pretend to be very mean. The child must hide when his father 
instructs him to do so, and never complain about the lack of food or 
harsh conditions, because complainers will be disqualified and sent 
home. As their existence grows increasingly difficult, Guido 
encourages his son to take heart, because more and more people are 
dropping out and they are growing much closer to winning the game.
While the constant threat of death hovers in the air, Benigni avoids 
explicit imagery. ''As a comedian,'' he told the L.A. Times, ''I 
couldn't do like Spielberg with 'Schindler's List' and show the 
violence directly. It's not my style. My style is to evoke and let 
people use their imaginations. Sometimes the horror can be even more 
powerful that way.'' 
The idea for the story sprang from Benigni's childhood. His father, a 
soldier imprisoned for two years in a German labor camp, was obsessed 
by his memories of the ordeal and frequently told his children about 
the nightmarish camp. Eventually, his wife convinced him that he was 
scaring the children, so he started telling the tales in a lighter 
way. ''He found funny things to say, even when dealing with these 
painful circumstances,'' said Benigni. ''The way he was telling the 
stories is exactly what I have done in my story.'' 
The film's title came from Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, who 
wrote that he believed ''life is beautiful,'' even as he sat trapped 
in a bunker, waiting for Stalin's agents to assassinate him. Benigni 
found the statement profound, saying ''I fell in love with this 
simple phrase, 'Life is beautiful.' Even with darkness all around us, 
we can still find beauty. That is true strength.''
Benigni's film is beautiful as well, although the going is often 
difficult. While the first half of the story has a certain charm, the 
pratfall comedy is more ingenious than funny, and Benigni's mugging 
gets old fast. The performer has been called the Robin Williams of 
Italy, and, like Williams, his comedic grandstanding frequently 
becomes overbearing. Thankfully, the lyricism of the story outweighs 
his lack of subtlety.
Nicoletta Braschi is adequate as Dora, although she lacks the depth 
necessary to convincingly express the emotions beneath her 
character's brave actions. As Giosue, young Giorgio Cantarini is a 
real charmer, interacting flawlessly with Benigni. When he questions 
his father's story, fearfully stating ''A man was crying. He said 
they make buttons and soap out of us,'' the effect is devastating. 
Of the supporting cast, Horst Buchholz is memorable as a riddle-
obsessed German doctor, providing one of the film's most poignant 
moments late in the story; Giustino Durano is haunting as Guido's 
uncle, and Aaron Craig does America proud in a brief appearance as a 
benevolent U.S. soldier.
It's not easy to sit through ''Life Is Beautiful.'' Between Benigni's 
mugging, the often flat comedy, and the structure of the piece, it's 
actually quite hard. But those up to challenge will receive ample 
dividends. Benigni's unique concept and wonderful message about the 
human spirit makes this awkward, ungainly film well worth the trouble.

I was 13 or 14 when I had my first rock and roll adventure. Two years
earlier, The Beatles made their initial appearance on the Ed Sullivan
Show and changed my life. From that night on, I devoured anything
connected with the British Invasion. Not content to wait for acts to
break on our shores, I bought the latest rock singles from England via a
mail order company I'd found in the back pages of Hit Parader magazine.
When I learned that a package tour starring Herman's Hermits and
featuring The Who and The Blues Magoos was scheduled for two shows at
the Indiana State Fair, my fevered adolescent brain went into overdrive.
After many phone calls, I received permission to meet the groups when
they arrived in Indianapolis. Armed with a Brownie camera and a flimsy
"Teen Press Card" purchased for 50 cents from Flip Magazine, I headed
for a private gate at Weir Cook Airport and watched the plane taxi to a
stop.
As the scruffy guys ambled down the steps, I ignored Herman's Hermits
and The Blues Magoos and made a beeline for The Who. Although the group
had yet to hit it big in the U.S., they were white hot in England,
courtesy of several amazing singles coupled with their habit of smashing
their instruments at the end of each concert. Taking a deep breath, I
introduced myself to the band and we chatted briefly. Then, to my utter
amazement, they invited me to join them for the shows.
My dad, bless his heart, put his wariness aside and allowed me to go.
The afternoon and evening was pure magic, as I hung in the dressing
areas and stood backstage during both incredible performances. The
highlight of the experience came between the shows, when Pete Townshend,
Keith Moon and I toured the State Fair Midway. Somewhere, I still have a
faded black and white photo of Moon and me on the Scrambler, snapped by
Mr. Townshend.
It was the greatest day in my young life.
"Almost Famous," the latest from writer/director Cameron Crowe ("Fast
Times at Ridgemont High," "Say Anything," "Jerry Maguire"), conveys all
the wonder I felt. The semi-autobiographical film, which chronicles the
life and times of a 15-year-old writer on the road with a rock band in
the early '70s, celebrates the majesty, the joy and the insanity of
those giddy days. With a first-rate cast and a flawless screenplay,
Crowe has crafted a wildly entertaining movie that effectively captures
lightning in a bottle. If rock music ever sent a shiver down your back,
this is the film for you.
Crowe became a journalist as a teen and William Miller (Patrick Fugit)
serves as his stand-in here. After writing several pieces for Creem
magazine and a local underground paper, the San Diego boy lands a plum
assignment over the phone from the editors of Rolling Stone, who have no
clue just how young the writer really is. William soon lights out with
Stillwater, an up-and-coming band, to gather material for a portrait of
the group. Days turn into weeks as the young journalist struggles to
remain objective while immersed in the lunacy of a rock tour.
The writer/band relationship begins with warnings all around. Stillwater
lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) urges the group to remember that "this
guy is the enemy  he writes what he sees." William's mentor, legendary
journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), cautions the boy to
keep a critical distance, because "these people are not your friends."
And Elaine (Frances McDormand), William's extremely fretful mother,
never misses a chance to call him and exhort "Don't take drugs!"
On the road, William becomes close to charismatic lead guitarist Russell
Hammond (Billy Crudup) and a stunning "band-aid" (a groupie with much
more class) who calls herself Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). In short order,
William learns that it is virtually impossible to remain a neutral
observer in the dazzling traveling circus.
While watching the film, I scribbled notes frantically before realizing
that the story was so well-written that I wanted to quote the whole
script. The acting matches the screenplay in quality. Jason Lee, who was
great in "Chasing Amy" and "Mumford," is a dynamo as the exuberant,
mouthy Stillwater frontman. The remarkable Philip Seymour Hoffman does
outstanding work as Lester Bangs, delivering a series of delicious
tirades, including a beaut on the value of being un-cool.
Patrick Fugit, making his feature film debut, anchors the film perfectly
as the naďve journalist. He is exceptionally good in his scenes with
Billy Crudup, who makes Russell appealing despite his many flaws.
"Fargo" star Frances McDormand continues her winning streak with a
crackling good turn as Elaine, who is less a mother and more a force of
nature. Finally, Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's daughter, gives the
production's most naunced performance as Penny Lane, a character radiant
in body and spirit.
Loose, funny, poignant and totally engaging, "Almost Famous" is a
valentine to the glory and madness of rock and roll. Some viewers may
find the goings-on too outrageous to be believed, but let me assure you,
both as the veteran of a rock band and as that wide-eyed kid walking the
Midway with The Who, it's all true.

The centerpiece of "Wild Wild West" is a huge mechanical spider. In one 
scene, the metallic arachnid looms over a small Utah town, then lumbers 
forward in an ungainly, but impressive fashion, destroying everything in 
its path. The film is a lot like that giant spider. It looks great, but 
moves awkwardly and, whenever matters are in doubt, just blows stuff up. 
Based on the quirky sci-fi/western TV series from the '60s and directed 
by Barry Sonnenfeld ("Men in Black"), the credits for "Wild Wild West" 
indicate that it was written by (get this) S.S. Wilson & Brent Maddock 
and Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman, from a story by Jim Thomas & John 
Thomas. Whew! Is there anything better than a film created by committee? 
The disjointed production plays as if Sonnenfeld threw several drafts of 
the script into the air, snagged pages at random as they fluttered down 
and started filming when he had a handful. Had the filmmakers spent a 
tenth as much time honing the script as they did on the nifty art 
direction, "Wild Wild West" would have been something more than drivel 
with a colorful candy coating. 
Set in the post-Civil War era, the film opens badly with a cumbersome 
sequence set at a West Virginian bordello, then moves to the White House, 
where President Ulysses S. Grant teams up a pair of quarreling special 
agents; brawler and all-around stud James T. West (Will Smith) and Felix 
Unger-ish inventor/master of disguise Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline). 
Together, they set off to battle the evil Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), 
a megalomaniac who, after losing the lower portion of his body in the war,
 kidnapped a group of scientists to create a super-weapon that would 
force Grant to surrender the newly re-United States. Oh, and lovely Rita 
Escobar (Salma Hayek) hooks up with the guys, hoping to rescue her father 
from the clutches of Loveless. 
The pluses of "Wild Wild West" are mostly visual. Gordon and West travel 
in a plush private train filled with Gordon's fanciful inventions. There 
are a number of striking sets, particularly Loveless' arachnid-themed 
mansion, which includes henchmen hidden within "living" paintings. The 
dapper Jim West and voluptuous Rita are easy on the eyes, and that giant 
mechanical spider is a knockout. 
The minuses are the lurching, unfocused storyline and hack script, which 
forces a lot of talented actors to recite some truly lame sentences. For 
every good one-liner, there are five duds and even the charismatic Will 
Smith can't salvage lines like "That's it. No more Mister Knife Guy!" 
"Wild Wild West" is designed as lightweight summer fun and its 
combination of attractive actors and retro-cool gadgets may be enough for 
some. But with Barry Sonnenfeld's track record and a cast this talented, 
we have a right to expect more than flashy effects, a few good moments 
and a lot of half-ass shtick.

Review for Two Girls and a Guy (1997)
Two Girls and a Guy (1998)
Robert Downey Jr., Heather Graham, Natasha Wagner. Directed by James 
Toback. 92 minutes.
R, 3 stars (out of five stars)

It's impossible to watch Robert Downey Jr. in "Two Girls and a Guy" 
without relating his onscreen performance with his off-screen life. 
Director James Toback wrote the film as a vehicle for his friend Downey, 
tailoring the story to focus on the actor's all too well known demons. 
The result is a riveting, often painfully intimate look at the soul of a 
man who is dangerously out of control. You leave the theater feeling that 
Downey has opened up and shared the darkest, most personal parts of 
himself. Unless, of course, he was just fooling us, the same way his 
character fooled the women who confront him in the story. 
Set almost entirely in a SoHo loft, "Two Girls and a Guy" is essentially 
a three-character drama. Lou (Natasha Wagner) and Carla (Heather Graham 
from "Boogie Nights" and "Lost In Space") are strangers who meet outside 
a Manhattan apartment building as they wait to surprise their respective 
boyfriends. While making small talk, they come to realize they are both 
waiting for the same man. Blake Allen (Downey,) a charming, self-absorbed 
young actor, has been seeing Carla three days a week and Lou on three 
other days. As for the seventh day, it's safe to assume he wasn't resting.
The shaken women decide a confrontation is in order. Lou climbs the fire 
escape, breaks out an apartment window and buzzes Carla in. Soon, the 
object of their affection returns home and the mind games begin.
As a film, "Two Girls and a Guy" is a somewhat clunky, claustrophobic 
piece of work, playing like an occassionally inspired, often strained 
exercise in improvisational theater. But as a character study, the piece 
is absolutely mesmerizing. Graham and Wagner are exceptional actors, 
creating a strong dynamic between their very different characters. Carla 
is a well-educated woman with a sophisticated air, complimented by an 
earthy nature and a sharp tongue. She has the reserved demeanor that 
often accompanies classical beauty, while Lou is the cuter and more 
outgoing of the two. Lacking the schooling of her peers, Lou makes up for 
it with street smarts and a bolder presentation style. 
Despite Graham and Wagner's well-drawn characters, this is clearly Robert 
Downey Jr.'s show and the troubled actor's performance is a tour de force.
 When the women confront him, rubbing his nose in the hackneyed come-on 
lines he used on both of them ("I never experienced real love before I 
met you," " You own my dick", etc.) Downey goes into one of the most 
dazzling song and dances ever recorded on film. Panicked, he emits a 
stream of pathetic excuses and wild rationalizations. He tries 
diversionary tactics, even feigning a suicide to remind the girls of how 
much they need him. Desperate, he attempts to turn the tables, claiming 
that the women's premeditated confrontation was far more cruel than 
anything he did in the name of love. 
The watershed scene comes as Downey confronts himself in the bathroom 
mirror, sobbing "When are you going to shape up?" along with a stream of 
invectives. This is the moment when the line between actor and character 
dissolves and we find ourselves looking squarely at Robert Downey Jr., 
the drug-addict. While the story addresses sexual duplicity, the subtext 
actually deals with the duplicity of an addict who spent years saying 
whatever was necessary to convince those trying to help him that their 
efforts were working, when in fact, his self-destructive behaviors 
continued to spiral out of control. This is Robert Downey Jr. naked, in 
front of the unflinching eye of the camera, finally dropping all the 
bullshit and facing his personal demons at long last.
Or is it? Midway through the story, one of the women asks Downey's 
character  "Do you have any feelings, or do you just play Hamlet all the 
time and pretend to have feelings?" The same question applies to Downey 
himself. Is he really experiencing a crucial moment of clarity in the 
film, or is he just pretending to have the breakthrough he knew was 
expected of him?  
There's no way of knowing whether what we saw was real, pretend, or a 
little of both. As of this writing, Downey has completed his jail term 
and moved to a drug rehabilitation facility. It's notable that he spent 
an evening away from the center to attend the premier of this film. 
Robert Downey Jr. is an extraordinarily gifted actor and, despite a 
contrived storyline and shaky dialogue, "Two Girls and a Guy" is a 
striking film, thanks primarily to his inspired performance. Robert 
Downey Jr. is also an addict, and as Neil Young wrote, "every junkie is a 
setting sun." Hopefully, Downey, like so very many others, will find the 
inspiration to change his life before nightfall.

Traditionally, the last two weeks of August and first two weeks of 
September spell nothing but bad news for filmgoers. The studios view the 
period as a cinematic Bermuda Triangle, a place to dump those movies too 
flimsy to compete in the crowded summer marketplace and too weak to have 
a prayer in the autumn Oscar marathon. For critics, reviewing these 
flicks is a daunting experience because, after three months of writing 
about dreck like "Wild Wild West" and "Inspector Gadget," most of us have 
run out of insults. So when a nice little offering like "Outside 
Providence" comes along, I feel particularly grateful. 
While the TV ads trumpet the film as a "non-stop laugh-fest from the 
creators of 'Dumb and Dumber,' 'Kingpin' and 'There's Something About 
Mary,'" "Outside Providence" actually contains as much drama as comedy. 
The Farrelly brothers brand of humor is present, but the jokes are 
incorporated into a surprisingly effective coming-of-age story.
Set in the blue-collar town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1974, the movie 
follows young Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), an aimless high school 
stoner living with his wheelchair-bound kid brother (Tommy Bone) and 
surly father (Alec Baldwin). When not lingering at the grave of his 
mother or enduring the insults of his dad (whose nickname for his son is 
"Dildo"), Tim spends his time smoking dope with his friends, until one 
fateful night when he has a run-in with the law. Literally.
The kid is spared a jail sentence when Pop pulls some strings and packs 
the boy off to spend his senior year two and a half hours away at the 
Cornwall Prep School. Initially, Tim seems hopelessly lost in this 
cultured environment, but he soon finds that the alien setting offers 
many new possibilities, including the prospect of romance. 
Plotwise, there's nothing in "Outside Providence" we haven't encountered 
countless times before, but the screenplay navigates adroitly through the 
various clichéd situations. In fact, many of the film's rewards come from 
what doesn't happen. A frail kid confronts a bully and, instead of a 
fight or chase scene, they quietly make peace with each other. A student 
feuds with an authority figure and, instead of building to some 
outlandish public confrontation, their relationship ends on a realistic 
note. A man faces an angry reaction from his buddies when he reveals that 
he's gay and, instead of a melodramatic make-up scene, we simply see the 
guys playing cards together again later, having come to terms with his 
revelation off-screen. 
More than anything else, "Outside Providence" is about growth and 
reconciliation, and the film feels far more touching and real than what 
one would expect for a work associated with the Farrelly brothers.
A great part of the authenticity comes from director Michael Corrente 
("Federal Hill," "American Buffalo"), who picked up Peter Farrelly's 
gritty 1988 comic novel for a buck in a used bookstore. Corrente found 
the book hilarious and saw in it the potential for something more than a 
standard teen comedy. He inserted his own dramatic sensibilities into the 
story, along with several images from his childhood, including a tender 
scene of Old Man Dunphy teaching Tim how to fasten his tie. Corrente also 
took a treasured memory of his parents playfully shooting Christmas tree 
bulbs with a "Rifleman" gun and reworked it into a poignant flashback 
sequence.   
Too often, actors playing working-class folks come off like they're 
slumming, but not here. Shawn Hatosy, the fresh-faced kid with the 
crooked teeth from "In and Out" and "The Faculty," hits just the right 
notes as Tim Dunphy. From his early scenes as a clueless druggie to the 
latter portion of the film, when he begins the rough journey towards 
manhood, Hatosy subtly works expression and inflection to make his 
character ring true. 
Alec Baldwin gives one of the best performances of his career as Old Man 
Dunphy, an emotionally stunted man who buries his pain beneath a stream 
of "good-natured" wisecracks. Baldwin expertly shades his portrayal of 
the damaged father, using his eyes to show the love for his sons that 
lies beneath Dunphy's crude and rude exterior.      
The supporting players are also good, with the exception of Tim Crowe, 
who overacts as dorm-master Mr. Funderburk, making him nasty almost to 
the point of being cartoonish. 
Stylistically, Corrente proves adept at mixing the Farrelly-style comic 
bits with the dramatic text. He also nicely contrasts the Pawtucket and 
Cornwall settings, using a grainier film stock for the hometown scenes. 
Although the film is packed with '70s hits, Corrente wisely keeps the era 
in the background, maintaining an appropriate perspective on the retro-
kitsch. 
The Farrelly brother's name could hurt "Outside Providence" more than it 
helps it. Those expecting a barrage of "There's Something About Mary" 
style gross-out gags may feel let down, while those who would appreciate 
the bittersweet coming-of-age story may very well avoid the film because 
of the Farrelly trademark. Hopefully, in the sea of early September 
mediocrity, this funny, sad, sweet little film will find the audience it 
deserves.

Review for Disturbing Behavior (1998)

Think "Dawson's Creek" meets "The Stepford Wives." Think "Beverly Hills 
90210" meets "A Clockwork Orange." Better yet, think about going to see 
anything other than "Disturbing Behavior."
A spoiler alert. Generally I avoid revealing significant plot points 
about movies, but I'm making an exception here because I simply don't 
care.  
"Disturbing Behavior" is a painfully derivative, hapless little thriller 
about small town authority figures who use computer implants and 
brainwashing techniques to turn unruly young people into Republicans. 
Unfortunately, when the Stepford teens get angry or sexually aroused, 
they become homicidal maniacs. Oh sure, this may sound like the Bob 
Dornan story, but it's really just another hack horror flick aimed at the 
"I Know What You Did Last Summer" crowd.
The film suffers from post-Kevin Williamson-syndrome, where writers 
desperately try to crank out the kind of pop-culture riddled, ironic 
dialogue that helped Williamson strike gold with his "Scream" movies. In 
a script packed with unconvincing slang and snarky dialogue, writer Scott 
Rosenberg comes up with only one decent line, when sarcastic teen 
outsider Gavin watches the male and female leads eyeing one another and 
says, "Wow, appropriate sparks are flying. Cue the power ballad." 
Apparently, Rosenberg knew he hit pay-dirt with the quip, because he 
actually uses it twice in the film. 
The story, such as it is, goes like this. New kid in town Steve (James 
Marsden) moves to Cradle Bay and hooks up with the annoying Gavin (Nick 
Stahl) and sultry Rachel ("Dawson Creek's" Katie Holmes). Gavin fills 
Steve in on the town's secret of success. Rebellious teens are taken away 
for "motivational weekends" with the "Blue Ribbon Club." They return as 
well-groomed All-American archetypes, with the aforementioned ultra-
violent programming glitch. 
Soon enough, our heroes learn that they are next on the list for 
involuntary "Blue Ribbon" membership. Oh, what to do! As the kids wring 
their hands over their pending entry into the Christian right, they 
stumble onto a handy fact. The sonic rat repellent machines the whacked-
out school janitor keeps in the basement just happen to emit a frequency 
that short circuits the Aryan youths' brains. From there on...well, you 
do the math.
Even material this trite could have worked in the proper hands, but these 
filmmakers just don't have a clue. David Nutter, who directed a number of 
"X-Files" episodes, relies on every stock teen horror flick cliché in the 
book, while a standard-issue rock soundtrack grinds away in the 
background. The notion of remote-controlled jocks is amusing, but 
Rosenberg wastes the satiric potential with his limp script. The cast 
doesn't help matters. Marsden and Holmes look like pouty Gap models, and 
Stahl is so irritating that in his case, the implants don't seem like 
that bad an idea.
With "Disturbing Behavior," it appears the dregs of summer have arrived a 
few weeks early. Incidentally, please forgive this shorter-than-usual 
article. Throwaway flicks like "Disturbing Behavior" don't warrant a 
lengthy review and besides, I have better things to do. I'm going to 
surround the next Promise Keepers convention with sonic rat repellents 
and turn them all on at once, just in case...

Review for Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998)
Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998)
Sean P. Hayes, Brad Rowe, Richard Ganoung, Meredith Scott Lynn, Matthew 
Ashford, Armando Valdes-Kennedy, Paul Bartel, Carmine Giovinazzo, Holly 
Woodlawn, Mark Allen Anderson, Christopher Bradley. Written and directed 
by Tommy O'Haver. 89 minutes.
Rated R, 3.5 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

Light as cotton candy, breezy and utterly charming, "Billy's Hollywood 
Screen Kiss" is reminiscent of one of those fluffy, exuberant Rock 
Hudson/Doris Day romantic comedies from the 60's, except in this case 
Rock is out of the closet and Doris is a guy.
Despite working on a shoestring budget, Indianapolis filmmaker and I.U. 
grad Tommy O'Haver had the audacity to film "Billy" in a cinemascope 
screen ratio, and his ballsy move works. Beautifully framed and drenched 
in vivid colors, the wide screen production is truly handsome, enhancing 
the film's innocent, good-old-days feel.
O'Haver has created an unusually beguiling hybrid of 90's sensibilities 
and 60's panache, as he examines the intricacies, absurdities and 
heartbreaks of the dating ritual. Although gays will especially 
appreciate his romantic observations, heterosexual audiences should also 
be receptive to the gentle truths about the human condition presented 
here.
Billy Collier is an up and coming photographer in the ultra-trendy L.A. 
art world. While working on a new photo project, recreating great screen 
kisses from Hollywood's Golden Age with an all-male/drag cast, and 
stumbling through the dating scene, he meets Gabriel, a great-looking 
coffee house waiter. Billy recruits him as a model, and the two build a 
friendship complicated by Billy's growing infatuation for Gabriel and 
Gabriel's confusion over his sexual orientation. Is Gabriel straight, gay 
or bi? More importantly, does he care as much for Billy as Billy cares 
for him, or is our young hero doomed to suffer the indignities of 
unrequited love?
Regardless of orientation, we've all been down that road. We've all tried 
to take things slow, because it's the sensible thing to do, while our 
hearts demand that we dive in the deep end of the romantic pool. We've 
all spent hours waiting for a phone call from that special someone, even 
while knowing the foolishness of such behavior. We've all tried valiantly 
to let things flow naturally, fighting that insidious impulse to 
manipulate situations to meet our romantic agenda.
And what gay man hasn't spent a sleepless night laying by a "platonic" 
buddy, hoping he'll roll over and plant a big Hollywood screen kiss on 
his lips? "Billy" captures all of that romantic torture, without ever 
falling into pathos or losing its sprightly spirit.
Thank O'Haver's ingenious script for that. Crisp and clever, his dialogue 
has the easy wit and insight of early Woody Allen relationship comedies, 
without any of the creepy undertones.
The actors do justice to O'Haver's words, with Sean P. Hayes a delight as 
Billy, the all-American kid just looking for love. Hayes hits all the 
right notes, balancing puppy-dog innocence with brains and style. Billy 
knows that he probably will get hurt, but he just can't resist Gabriel's 
beauty and charm. 
Brad Rowe, a Brad Pitt look-a-like who joined the cast of "NewsRadio" 
late last season, is very effective as Gabriel, deftly creating a 
character who is a bit dim and shallow, but utterly genuine. In lesser 
hands, Gabriel could easily have been just a himbo, but Rowe invests the 
character with enough substance that we understand why Billy is drawn to 
his spirit as well as his body.
The supporting cast is strong as well, with Meredith Scott Lynn a stand-
out as George, Billy's confidant and ersatz big sister. Armando Valdes-
Kennedy also scores as a Latin lover who just can't stop telling Billy 
how "special" he is.
With a drag trio popping up from time to time as the film's Greek chorus 
and several inventive dream sequences, "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" 
maintains a cheery, unpretentious tone, playing like a gay "Gidget" while 
gently dealing with the temptations and trauma of romance. The film was a 
big hit at last years Sundance Festival with good reason. O'Haver has 
spun a rich, entertaining confection, a gay film that manages to be 
mainstream without compromising itself. Now that's something to be out 
and proud about.

Even after reading the pathetic excuses from the Warner Brothers spin 
doctors for withholding one of the summers most anticipated films from 
critics, I went into "The Avengers" hoping for the best. Maybe they 
really had withheld the film so that audiences could "discover" it on 
their own. Sadly, the negative buzz turned out to be true. "The Avengers" 
is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year. In addition, it's 
absolutely the most dreadful big screen adaptation of a TV series I have 
ever witnessed, taking the ultra-stylish, clever 60's spy show and 
turning into a disjointed, garish train wreck of a movie.
So what went wrong? Virtually everything. Let's start with the central 
characters. As played by Patrick Macnee, John Steed was a conservative, 
dapper fellow and formidable foe. His droll wit and assured smile 
reflected the confidence of a consummate renaissance man. In the hands of 
the usually excellent Ralph Fiennes, Steed merely seems constipated. 
Wearing a smirk for most of the film, his performance is far too wispy 
and tentative for a character of such substance.
As for Mrs. Peel, the results are even more painful. Diana Riggs turned 
the character into the epitome of chic, combining razor sharp 
intelligence, a keen sense of humor, killer fighting skills and a 
devastating smoky sexuality. Uma Thurman simply hasn't a clue. While her 
Mrs. Peel possesses the appropriate looks and wardrobe, everything else 
is missing. More often than not, she comes off like a coy model or simply 
a victim.
In the series, the relationship between John Steed and Mrs. Peel simmered 
beautifully. Here they kiss, effectively killing the romantic and sexual 
tension the original maintained for years. Imagine if Mulder and Scully 
had smooched in the first episode of "The X Files" and you'll have an 
idea of the dampening effect this kiss has on the duo.
As for the legendary banter between the characters, most of the lines 
here are as stilted and leaden as the scripted exchanges between Academy 
Award presenters before they open the envelopes. What passes for wit is 
often beyond embarrassing. The film contains a scene where Mrs. Peel 
falls through a hole in the earth and plummets into the villain's lair. 
When he greets her, she actually says "I thought I'd drop in." This is 
humor? For God's sake, cartoons don't even use that line anymore!
Speaking of villains, the bad guy here is Sir August De Wynter (Sean 
Connery, in a blustery performance), a megalomaniac bent on taking over 
the world with a purloined weather-controlling machine. The plot, for 
lack of a better word, involves clones, criminals dressed as bulky teddy 
bears, giant mechanical bees, and enough outrageously fake looking snow, 
cut-rate CGI and cheesy special effects for a dozen low budget syndicated 
sci-fi TV shows (hell, even the blue screen scenes look phony). 
Add a lot of big, showy sets and costumes to the aforementioned mess and 
what have you got? A disaster strongly resembling last years horrible 
"Batman and Robin," except that, hard is it may be to believe, this one 
is even worse. Reportedly, the studio chopped a great deal of footage 
from the film following disastrous test screenings, resulting in a final 
90 minute version that feels like three hours. 
The edit renders the comic book plot incomprehensible at times, as 
characters appear and disappear from various locales for no discernible 
reason. A perfect example is a scene where Mrs. Peel enters a phone booth 
on the estate of her enemy and states the code words to trigger a secret 
entry mechanism. How does she know the villain's code? Why is there a 
phone booth in the middle of a sprawling estate? And most importantly, 
how did they take a wicked good TV series and turn it into such a 
godawful movie?
Stay away from "The Avengers." Episodes of the original series are due on 
video shortly and it's likely that some cable network will rerun the 
series to capitalize on the publicity from this travesty. Seek out the 
show and you can enjoy one of the highlights of 60's pop culture 
entertainment while avoiding one of the low points of the 90's.

Review for Preacher's Wife, The (1996)
The Preacher's Wife (1996)
Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, Courtney B. Vance, Justin Pierre 
Edmund, Gregory Hines, Jennifer Lewis, Lionel Richie. Directed by Penny 
Marshall. 125 minutes
PG, 3.5 stars (out of 5 stars)
A really good Christmas movie is hard to find. For every "Miracle On 34th 
Street" or "It's A Wonderful Life," there's hundreds of films that don't 
stand the test of time. Hopefully, "The Preacher's Wife" will become one 
of the keepers.
The story is simple. Reverend  Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) has doubts 
about his effectiveness in helping his community and family. His prayer 
for help is answered with the arrival of Dudley (Denzel Washington,) an 
over-enthusiastic angel who becomes tangled with the parish, and develops 
a crush on Mrs. Biggs (Whitney Houston.)
Penny Marshall's assured direction makes "The Preacher's Wife" shine. She 
adroitly works around Whitney Houston's limited acting skills, 
highlighting Houston's vocals while using the other actors to convey the 
story.
Courtney B. Vance gives a strong performance as the Reverend Biggs. 
Trying to carry a neighborhood on his shoulders has worn Biggs down, 
leaving him a fretful, shaken man. Vance effectively imparts the 
minister's grim mood, while keeping him a sympathetic character. Denzel 
Washington is charming as the angel, in a playful, loose performance. He 
manages to be boundlessly optimistic without ever becoming cloying. The 
most memorable performance, however, comes from Justin Pierre Edmund, an 
adorable six year old who plays the Biggs' son. Edmund is a mush-mouthed 
delight in a bright, innocent performance that would win over even the 
most cynical viewer.
The real strength of "The Preacher's Wife" lies in its sense of community 
and spirituality. The inner-city neighborhood operates as an extended 
family  these people care about each other, and their love and faith is 
infectious. The many songs performed by Houston and the church choir help 
to bolster the sense of joyous communal spirituality.
The film is not without flaws. Houston's acting is almost as vacuous as 
her voice is strong. During several key dramatic scenes, she has an odd, 
pre-occupied look. And Gregory Hines' turn as the villain of the story, a 
land developer who wants to "improve" the neighborhood by tearing the 
heart out of it, lacks a sense of real menace.  
"The Preacher's Wife" triumphs over its weak spots due to the film's 
overwhelming spirit. Memorable Christmas movies work when they convey 
sentiment in a genuine fashion. "The Preacher's Wife" is destined to 
become a holiday classic.

Title
Review for Chasing Amy (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
More often than not, romantic comedies oversimplify romance. The writers 
whip up one big problem for the star-crossed lovers, milk it for its 
comic possibilities, then have one of the lead characters make an 
impassioned speech after which the couple kisses passionately and lives 
happily ever after. "Chasing Amy" is a romantic comedy that doesn't 
oversimplify. This extremely funny, well-written film tells the story of 
a very complicated romance with many revelations, but no easy answers.
Holden (Ben Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee) are best friends and creators 
of a thriving comic book. At a comic convention, Holden meets fellow 
artist Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) and the two hit it off immediately. In 
short order, Holden falls in love with Alyssa and begins charting their 
future, failing to notice that Alyssa is a lesbian. When he finds out, he 
pursues her anyway, as his best friend stares in frustration and 
disbelief.
"Chasing Amy" was written and directed by Kevin Smith, who also made 
"Clerks" and "Mallrats." Smith has a real gift for creating dialogue that 
dazzles, but still rings true. "Chasing Amy" discusses sexuality in far 
more explicit terms than any film in recent memory, but the words never 
seem cheap or contrived. Smith uses the extremely frank dialogue to paint 
a detailed portrait of the politics of love and sex. In the process, he 
creates some memorable characters.
Ben Affleck, who stars in the upcoming "Going All The Way," is compelling 
as Holden, an artist who fancies himself a radical, but possesses a 
staunchly traditional value system that undermines his attempts at 
extremism. Jason Lee, playing Holden's partner and devoted best friend, 
steals scenes with his sharp tongue, smoldering anger and sexy eyes. As 
Alyssa, Joey Lauren Adams has the film's most complex character. Alyssa 
isn't the kind of cookie-cutter lesbian you generally see in movies. Over 
the course of the story, more and more layers of her personal and sexual 
history are revealed, and we get a sense of the true strength of this 
young artist's character. Adams, in a performance reminiscent of Renee 
Zellweger's in "Jerry Maguire," shows us a woman who initially appears to 
be a bubbly lightweight, but in fact has a much more realized sense of 
self than any of the other characters.
"Chasing Amy" is the funniest film I've seen so far this year, and easily 
the most touching. The explicit dialogue may leave you feeling a bit 
squirmy from time to time, and that's a good thing. Romantic comedies 
rarely even flirt with truth. "Chasing Amy" deals with truths you may not 
wish to consider, opening doors that some feel are better left closed. 
The film is funny, romantic, and a bit challenging. Go see it.

The biggest hurdle facing a movie like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
is the enthusiasm of its own fans. All the glowing reviews and critics'
awards bestowed on the production since it opened in limited release
last month may lead theatergoers to anticipate more than any film can
possibly deliver. If you go to "Crouching Tiger" expecting the moon and
the stars, you'll likely be disappointed. But if you're in the mood for
a beautifully photographed melodrama punctuated by dazzling martial arts
sequences, then get ready for some big fun.
Director Ang Lee, the man behind "The Wedding Banquet," "Eat Drink Man
Woman," "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm," is known for his
meticulous approach to storytelling and "Crouching Tiger" represents his
most ambitious undertaking to date. Along with a series of thrilling
gravity-be-damned fight scenes, Lee presents a sumptuous tale of a
rebellious young woman, two aging warriors and a love-struck outlaw.
While the exposition isn't as buoyant as the action set pieces and
occasionally becomes a bit too stately, Lee adds humor and old fashioned
romance at just the right moments to balance things out.
Set in the early 19th century, the tale begins when revered warrior Li
Mu Bai (Chow Yun-fat) decides to put away his sword, a 400-year-old
blade called Green Destiny. He entrusts the legendary weapon to a friend
and fellow warrior, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), asking her to deliver
it to Beijing while he goes to visit the grave of his master.
In Beijing, Shu Lien meets Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a politician's bright young
daughter about to be forced into an arranged marriage. Desperately
unhappy with the direction her life is headed, Jen wishes she could
experience the adventures of a warrior and bonds with Shu Lien almost
immediately.
Under the veil of night, a dark-clothed figure makes off with Green
Dragon. The guards shout the alarm and the chase begins, with Shu Lien
in pursuit of the thief. In an extraordinarily well-choreographed
sequence, they chase each other through the compound until the thief
springs onto a roof. In casual defiance of trivialities like gravity,
Shu Lien skitters up a wall and the two break out their best martial
arts moves, exchanging blows and leaping from rooftop to rooftop like
Superman in the early days. The sequence is breathtaking and just a hint
of things to come.
Each successive battle ups the visual ante, building to a showstopper
with warriors soaring up through a forest, where they duke it out on
impossibly thin treetop branches. I tried to sort out the internal logic
of these magnificent scenes and came up with the following: A warrior
cannot simply levitate at will, but can fly from one point to another as
long as he or she is in battle. To stay airborne, however, they must
come into contact with something physical every few seconds. It all
makes for absolutely spectacular eye candy, accented by a superb score
from Tan Dun, with cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma.
But don't make the mistake of dismissing the rest of the film as
between-battle filler. There's much more going on here than trippy
martial arts aerobatics. Like Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-pei), who murdered
Li's master and has plans for all the principal characters. Or the
long-repressed love between Li and Shu Lien, which threatens to break
into a full-fledged romance. Or Li and Shu Lien's attempts to become
mentors for the masked thief. Not enough? How about a dandy extended
flashback revealing the forbidden affair between Jen and long-haired
outlaw, Lo (Chang Chen), with the pair squabbling and smooching in the
Western China desert?
There's humor as well, particularly in a riotous sequence at a frontier
outpost where Jen dispatches a thug with one hand while eating dinner,
and then takes on a few dozen of his friends. The comic timing in this
sequence is letter perfect, with Ang Lee and company proving to be as
adept at slapstick as they are at everything else.
None of this could work, of course, without a stellar group of actors.
As Li, Chow Yun-fat, one of the most magnetic performers in the
business, gives an appropriately restrained performance, projecting
great inner strength along with an intense sense of regret. Michelle
Yeoh radiates grace and vitality as Shu Lien, and Zhang Ziyi makes Jen
explode with spit and thunder. As Lo, Chang Chen manages to seem at once
dashing and uncertain, while, in the pivotal role of Jade Fox, Cheng
Pei-pei is pure evil on a stick.
A friend of mine maintains that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a
simply a contemporary martial arts movie with delusions of grandeur.
Having seen relatively few films in the genre, I have no idea whether or
not he is correct. But I do know that, despite a few slow spots, I love
what Ang Lee has done here. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is grand
entertainment on virtually every level and easily one of the best films
of 2000. Don't go by me, though. I'd hate for you to enter the theater
with unrealistic expectations.

William Thomas Cummings said "There are no atheists in foxholes." 
According to "The Thin Red Line," there was at least one, along with a 
number of bad poets and first year philosophy students. Visually 
sumptuous and astoundingly pretentious, "The Thin Red Line" takes a 
bracing portrayal of the battle of Guadalcanal and buries it within 
nearly three hours of nature footage, muddled philosophizing, and endless 
navel-gazing. Some have proclaimed the film a masterpiece that transcends 
traditional narrative structure to become a cinematic meditation. I found 
it more a grandiose doodle, the kind of thing a screenwriter might come 
up with after smoking too much dope while watching old war movies on TV. 
If a novice director had screened this film, he would likely have been 
told, "Nice cinematography, Skippy. Now put away your bong, take this 
self-indulgent rough cut back to the editing room and chop out about an 
hour and a half. You might start by lopping off that wandering-in-
paradise opening sequence along with the virtually incoherent 45 minutes 
at the end. Get rid of those godawful voice-overs, Hallmark Hall of Fame 
flashbacks, and a lot of the Wild Kingdom animal shots. Turn down the 
orchestra so we can hear the dialogue, color-code the soldiers so we can 
tell one from another, and lose those distracting cameos from John 
Travolta and George Clooney. Oh, and you know those scenes where you were 
trying to show that the Japanese soldiers were scared, confused human 
beings just like the Americans? It might help if you added subtitles. 
Think about it, kid." 
But instead of a novice, we're dealing with writer/director Terrence 
Malick, who dazzled filmgoers with "Badlands" in 1973 and "Days of 
Heaven" in '78, then dropped out of the filmmaking world for 20 years, 
becoming an icon in the process. Given the blind eye turned to the woozy 
metaphysics and astounding lack of discipline shown by Malick in this 
endurance test, it appears that absence really does makes the heart grow 
fonder, and the critical skills duller. 
Loosely based on the James Jones novel, "The Thin Red Line" boasts 
amazing cinematography and, midway through the film, a lengthy, gripping 
depiction of American troops battling to capture a hilltop machine gun 
nest from the Japanese. The sequence eloquently conveys the fear and 
chaos of warfare, along with the utter randomness of who lives or dies, 
as soldiers attempt to follow battle plans while bullets and grenade 
fragments rip through their comrades.
But Malick isn't content to let the horror of war speak for itself. His 
sights are set much higher. He intends the film to be a grand tone poem, 
about man and nature and God and stuff. After shooting a tremendous 
amount of footage and assembling a six hour version of the movie, he 
reinvented the story in the editing room for the three hour cut. By the 
time he was finished, one major character was left with only two lines, 
while others disappeared completely. The disjointed result minimizes 
dialogue, replacing it with orchestral swells, symbolism-loaded shots of 
birds, dreamy flashbacks and loads of voice-overs.
Oh, those voice-overs. It feels like open stage night at the World War II 
coffeehouse as the audience is subjected to lines like "Love, where does 
it come from? Who lit this flame in us?" Wait, there's more. Try these on 
for size. "What's this war at the heart of nature? Why does nature vie 
with itself? Is there an avenging power in nature?'' "How did we lose the 
good that was given us? Let it slip away. Scattered. Careless. What's 
keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory?" The film is packed 
with gems like these. Hell, one guy even narrates his own death.
Out of all the chatter, I found the ongoing debate between a spiritual 
soldier ("Maybe all men got one big soul that everybody's a part of") and 
a foxhole atheist ("Only one thing a man can do. Find something that's 
his. Make an island for himself.") engaging, but their intriguing 
relationship is given scant attention, as Malick instead focuses his 
camera on waving grass and prismatic beams of sunlight cutting through 
forest canopies.
I've said little about the actors because they tend to blur together. Two 
major players (Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin) resemble each other so much 
that it's hard to distinguish between them, and the rest come and go so 
quickly that you can't get a handle on their characters. That said, Sean 
Penn and Elias Koteas make the most of their screen time, Nick Nolte is 
imposing as a throwback to the John Wayne era and Woody Harrelson has a 
brief, but tragically moving scene.
If you're interested in a cinematic meditation on life and death that 
actually has substance, rent Peter Weir's "Fearless." I wish Malick had. 
Then he might have realized that pretty pictures and vague pondering do 
not a movie make. War is hell, and, moments of brilliance aside, so is 
"The Thin Red Line."

To put this review in its proper context, I should acknowledge right up 
front that I'm a "Star Trek: The Next Generation" fan. Yes, I've reached 
that point in life where I can publicly admit that I am in touch with my 
inner geek. Like many who enjoyed "ST:TNG," I was irritated when 
Paramount elected to fold the still-thriving show so that the vigorous 
cast could replace the geezers from the original series and keep the 
company's lucrative "Trek" movie franchise alive. Thanks to the corporate 
money-grubbers, instead of 24 varied episodes a season, we now only get 
new doses of the Enterprise crew every two or three years, usually in 
trumped-up "thrill-ride" movies that bury the characters under a barrage 
of action scenes. 
Thankfully, "Star Trek: Insurrection" is the exception to the rule. While 
the ninth entry in the franchise has plenty of battles to appease the 
testosterone junkies, "Insurrection" places the emphasis more on people 
than explosions. The quirkiest "Trek" yet, "Insurrection" is breezy, low-
key and often humorous. It plays less like an "event" movie and more like 
a juicy two-part episode of the series. 
This time around, the crew faces off against corrupt Federation officials 
allied with some nasty aliens bent on removing a group of settlers from a 
planet that is a virtual fountain of youth. When the Enterprise crew 
discover the true agenda of the Son'a, age-obsessed beings who get more 
face-lifts than Michael Jackson, Captain Picard and company remove the 
pips from their uniforms and become freedom fighters, protecting the 
idyllic Ba'ku colony from Starfleet and the alien invaders. 
Along the way, most of the cast gets a chance to live it up. In 
particular, Patrick Stewart lets his hair down (so to speak) with an 
exceptionally robust portrayal of Jean-Luc Picard. As opposed to the last 
two films, which placed the Captain in a variety of grim situations, this 
"Trek" highlights the swashbuckling aspects of the character. Picard even 
gets a little planet-side romance with Anji (Donna Murphy), a Ba'ku woman 
who bears a striking resemblance to Susan Oliver, the actress who 
romanced Captain Pike in the pilot episode of the original "Star Trek" 
series. 
The Ba'ku planet emits particles that retard the aging process and the 
Enterprise crew quickly feels the effects of the phenomenon. Blind 
engineer Geordi LaForge (Levar Burton) finds his eyes regenerated and 
finally gets to witness a sunrise without using high-tech visors or 
ocular implants to "see." After wearing a car fender over his brow for 
seven seasons and machine-like contact lenses for two films, what a 
relief it must have been for Burton to have his eyes clear of appliances.
The planet affects the libido as well, stirring up the long-dormant 
romance between Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi (Marina 
Sirtis), who share a bubble-bath in one playful scene. Doctor Beverly 
Crusher (Gates McFadden) shows more zest than usual, while Worf (Michael 
Dorn) suffers the indignities of Klingon puberty, dealing simultaneously 
with an increase in his already aggressive nature and a Texas-sized zit 
on the side of his nose. 
Only the android Data (Brent Spiner), who leaves his emotion chip on the 
Enterprise, is unaffected by all the hyper-hormonal activities. He spends 
most of the film tending to business, while a Ba'ku kid tries to teach 
him how to play. After the last two Data-centric films, it was nice to 
see his character in a supportive role, allowing the others a bit more 
time in the spotlight. 
"Insurrection's" mix of humor and heroics is the most successful since 
"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home." Two early gags, one showing Worf taking 
a bump on the noggin and the other involving several characters singing a 
Gilbert and Sullivan tune, triggered memories of cringe-inducing scenes 
from "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier," the worst "Trek" movie ever, but 
director Jonathan Frakes handles most of the jokes with style. 
The film has its weak moments. Compared to previous "Trek" villains, 
Son'a leader Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) is a real featherweight. For an 
exotic race of immortals, the Ba'ku look an awful lot like a bunch of 
lily-white suburbanites preparing for a camp-out. And why, oh why, do the 
producers feel the need to include a leaden catch-phrase in every film? 
When Brent Spiner is forced to say "Saddle up, lock and load," you can 
sense the embarrassment behind his expressionless face.   
But enough complaining. The light and lively "Star Trek: Insurrection" 
deserves credit for daring to break from the standard "Trek" formula. 
While some fans will grouse about the film, I found this change of pace 
most welcome. Instead of witnessing yet another struggle to save the 
universe, it's refreshing to see the Enterprise crew have a little fun 
for a change.

Review for G.I. Jane (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Congratulations are due to Demi Moore. After a series of increasingly bad 
career moves, climaxed by her starring role in the horrific "Striptease", 
she has finally landed in a fairly good film. Structurally, "G.I. Jane" 
is just another cliché-filled military flick, but Moore and director 
Ridley Scott invest so much vigor into the film that it works anyway. 
In this intense drama, a crusty Texas senator uses her clout to challenge 
the military ban on women in combat. As Senator Lillian DeHaven, Anne 
Bancroft has a ball, using a now-you-hear-it, now-you-don't Southern 
drawl and slinky, cat-like movements in her portrayal of a sleazy veteran 
politician exhilarated with power games. This is Bancroft's best role in 
years, and it's great fun watching her play with the part. Following 
DeHaven's victory in a pissing contest with the military brass, Naval 
Intelligence officer Jordan O'Neil (Moore) is recruited as a test case, 
the first woman allowed to tackle the grueling Navy SEAL's program. 
Moore quickly establishes O'Neil as a smart, skilled and extremely 
focused officer. The script quickly throws her into the same boot camp 
nightmare we've seen in "Full Metal Jacket", "An Officer And A Gentlemen" 
and numerous other "can they triumph against the odds" pictures. The 
situation is cliched, but director Ridley Scott ("Thelma and Louise", 
"White Squall") establishes and maintains a strong momentum, giving the 
film a sense of urgency that transcends the cliched storyline more often 
than not. Moore does solid work as well. Her tendency towards playing 
things way too seriously has hurt her in previous films, but this time 
around it is a crucial factor in setting in place the integrity and 
intensity of O'Neil's personality. 
Aside from Lt. O'Neil and Senator DeHaven, the film's other characters 
are more archetypes than individuals. There's the loving, but wary 
boyfriend, the tough, but caring drill instructor, and of course, the rag-
tag mix of fellow SEAL wannabes. The film takes exactly the route one 
might expect, with the boys expressing varying degrees of outrage over 
O'Neil's presence, until it reaches the obligatory scene where O'Neil 
wins over her fellow trainees. 
During an particularly brutal battle exercise, she kicks the hell out of 
her foe, then triumphantly shouts "Suck my dick!", drawing cheers from 
the other trainees, as well as the audience. Now, let's take just a 
moment and think about this. Over the course of the film, O'Neil insists 
on absolutely equal treatment, going as far as shaving her head and 
bunking with the men. Extreme measures, but an understandable approach 
for a character determined to prove her worth. But what in the world is 
"Suck my dick!" all about? Are the filmmakers seriously suggesting that 
to be accepted as an equal with men, you must pretend to be one? An odd 
approach for a film supposedly taking a feminist stand. 
Or maybe not so odd, when one considers the many scenes of O'Neil 
training privately in sweaty, skimpy outfits, a very nice excuse for some 
long, loving T&A shots. One suspects that "G.I. Jane" isn't making any 
particular feminist statement at all. It appears the woman-in-combat 
motif was simply considered a good hook for an action movie, not to 
mention a nice vehicle for Demi Moore to salvage her flagging career. 
Despite the film's decidedly mixed messages, "G.I. Jane" still works, 
primarily because Ridley Scott knows how to make an action film feel 
solid. Clichés be damned, the training sequences pack real clout. When 
O'Neil is assaulted again and again, the staging and sound effects make 
those scenes feel all too real. Even for seasoned moviegoers, it's hard 
not to wince and turn away when watching O'Neil brutalized in such a 
realistic fashion.
Towards the end of the film, O'Neil's outfit gets thrown into an actual 
combat situation, and you can take it from there. Every conceivable 
battle cliché happens, and you know what? The climax is STILL rousing, 
because by this point you've either left the theater or thrown away any 
expectations of credibility. Feminist trappings aside, the bottom line is 
that "G.I. Jane" is a good old fashioned war movie, the kind John Wayne 
fans would approve of. Demi Moore and Ridley Scott may not have a lot to 
brag about here, but they certainly don't need to apologize either.

"The Replacements" is a wacky underdog sports movie, the latest in a
long series of films that rigidly adhere to a crowd-pleasing formula.
Despite the presence of a talent like Gene Hackman, the Keanu Reeves
football comedy is a pretty anemic piece of work, which got me thinking:
Why watch a lame formula flick when you can crank out one of your own?
Just grab your camcorder, round up some buddies and create your very own
film, using:
THE DO-IT-YOURSELF WACKY UNDERDOG SPORTS MOVIE KIT
Instructions: Simply stick to the following story points. Feel free to
use your imagination, but don't get carried away. Remember, original
ideas don't go over very well in this genre.
Story Point One: The team needs to win in the worst way, and that's
probably the only way they could, because the owner is:
B. A cynic just going through the motions
Story Point Two: The owner hires a new coach; a great guy except:
B. He has a problem with anger management
Story Point Three: The coach must round up new players fast, because the
regular players:
C. Have lost their passion for the game
Story Point Four: He rounds up a colorful group of misfits, including
(select as many as you wish from the following):
B. A wildly over-enthusiastic kid whose bravado masks his fears
E. A gigantic man who practices voodoo
F. Three dorky brothers who turn into maniacs on the playing field
G. An over-the-hill former star whose body is giving out on him
H. A convict (former or current  it doesn't matter) who scares everybody
I. A noble athlete often picked on because he is deaf, gay or a hick
Story Point Five: Practice begins, with the ragtag team comically
screwing up on the field (accompanied by numerous classic rock songs)
and squabbling in the locker room. A crusty real life sports broadcaster
(sometimes two) provides humorous commentary, while inexplicably
following the team to all of their games. Meanwhile, the handsome rebel
player establishes a relationship with:
C. A plucky barmaid who moonlights as a cheerleader
D. His ex; hardened by their breakup, but secretly plucky
Story Point Six: Inspired by the burgeoning relationship and determined
to prove the naysayers wrong, the handsome rebel manages to pull the
players together. Despite their unorthodox methods, the team starts
winning games. The crusty broadcaster stops making fun of the team and
the empty stands fill with fans juiced by the sight of athletes who are
on the field for the "right" reasons. Unfortunately, on the eve of the
Big Game, the handsome rebel loses confidence because:
C. The evil owner, who secretly wants the team to lose, suspends or replaces him
Story Point Seven: Luckily, at the last moment, he receives an
inspirational speech from:
The speech will include at least one of the following statements:
A. "I look at you and see the man you are and the man you ought to be  someday those two are bound to meet."
B. "Go ahead and give up. But just remember that if you do, you'll prove that those jerks were right about you!"
C. "Don't you understand that you have a chance here that most men only dream of having, and you're on the verge of throwing it all away?"
D. "Hey, asshole! Have you thought about the endorsement possibilities?"
Story Point Eight: Invigorated by the speech, he rallies the team.
Against all odds, under the worst possible conditions, they hit the
field, employing their wildest (and most illegal) plays yet. Things look
bleak, but at the very last second, the handsome rebel suggests a play
that is impossibly outrageous and:
There you have it. Sure, you can watch "The Replacements" and get the
expected results or you can go out and make your own movie. I have a
pretty good idea what your decision will be, though, because when I look
at you, I see the man you are and the man you ought to be  and I think
today is the day the two will meet.

"Rounders" offers an interesting look into the world of high-stakes poker,
 as well as some very good acting from Matt Damon, Edward Norton and 
Martin Landau. Unfortunately, the film lacks a compelling story arc, 
credible interpersonal relationships and characters that grow or change. 
As a result it feels incomplete, as if we're watching a filmed version of 
the first or second draft of a story rather than the finished product.
Establishing a conspiratorial tone with low-key voice-over narration, 
professional card player Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) ushers us into the 
smoky netherland of illicit poker that flourishes in musty back rooms of 
old buildings, protected by thick doors and beefy security guards. 
According to Mike, success as a rounder comes as much from reading the 
body language of an opponent as it does from the cards he holds.
After losing a whopping $30,000 during one bad night, Mike swears off the 
game and focuses on his legal studies, to the great relief of his 
girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol). The future looks bright until nine months 
later, when Mike's best friend Worm (Edward Norton) emerges from prison 
with a rakish smile on his face and a heavy gambling debt on his back. 
Within a short period of time, Mike is in the game again, with his 
relationship and studies in shambles and a major portion of Worm's debt 
on his own shoulders. To save their collective asses and assets, Mike 
must play the game like he has never played before.
Matt Damon anchors "Rounders" with another rock solid performance. He 
possesses something magical that goes beyond his good looks and 
exceptional acting skills. When you study Damon's face you can instantly 
picture what he looked like as a child and what he will look like as an 
old man. There's an air of familiarity about him that's comforting; 
watching him onscreen is like visiting an old friend. The film's 
exploration of the gritty, exotic gaming underworld is even more 
engrossing with Damon as our tour guide.
The chameleon-like Edward Norton creates another riveting 
characterization in the jittery, impulsive Worm, who comes off like a 
younger version of "Midnight Cowboy's" Ratso Rizzo. But, as presented in 
this screenplay, Worm's relationship with Mike just doesn't ring true. 
We're told that they have been best friends since childhood, but together 
they're like oil and water. Worm isn't just reckless and compulsive; he 
is completely self-destructive and shows no hesitation in pulling Mike 
down with him. Surely his behavior would have destroyed their friendship 
long before the men reached their mid 20's. 
To be sure, the incredible loyalty Mike displays for Worm doesn't extend 
to his girlfriend. He appears to have little problem breaking his 
promises to Jo, a stable woman who stuck with him even after he blew $30 
grand, choosing instead to head out for a night of rounding with Worm. 
The relationships between all three characters are unconvincing, playing 
simply as contrivances of the screenwriters to get all the cast members 
into their proper positions for the card games.
Pity poor Gretchen Mol, stuck with an utterly thankless role. Her job is 
merely to simmer, cluck at her wayward boyfriend and look wounded. 
Although the acting credit will be nice for her résumé, the film would 
have played more honestly had it omitted the role completely and just cut 
to the chase.
As for the other supporting characters, Martin Landau gives a luminous 
performance as Mike's law professor and ersatz father figure. Projecting 
strength, grace and warmth beneath his frail, bird-like appearance, 
Landau is a wonder who gets better and better with each new film. John 
Turturro does solid work as a man who plays not for sport, but to support 
his family. And John Malkovich is fun as Mike's nemesis, employing a 
thick Russian accent in a hammy, but engaging performance. 
Ultimately, "Rounders" is a minor pleasure. The glimpse into an exotic, 
edgy world is absorbing and the performances of Damon, Norton and Landau 
are rewarding, despite the shaky credibility of their characters' 
relationships. But "Rounders" is frustrating because it could have been 
so much more, had the writers only devoted more attention to the script. 
Oh well, I suppose with a film like this, you just have to play the cards 
you're dealt.

Although he has only been in town for a little over four months, Dr. 
Mumford already has more patients than the other two therapists in 
the small, homey village. Mumford has a way about him. He avoids 
technical jargon, has a surprisingly frank approach and, more than 
anything, he is great at listening. So great that most clients find 
it easy to share their deepest secrets with him, even though he is 
awfully casual in the area of patient confidentiality. What they 
don't know about Mumford is that the good doctor has a secret of his 
own. As he eventually tells a skateboarding billionaire who becomes 
his patient and friend, "I am not now, nor have I ever been, a 
psychologist."
This gentle comedy shares a few similarities to "The Big Chill," 
another film from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan. Both are 
structurally loose, with next to no major conflict. Instead, the 
focus is on the small personal dramas of a number of nicely-drawn 
characters. Both productions tend to wander, hopping from one subplot 
to another. While I generally find meandering of this sort annoying, 
it proves refreshing in this context, largely due to the 
overwhelmingly benign nature of the story. With its sweet, easygoing 
tone, "Mumford" is the cinematic equivalent of a nice lazy stroll on 
a fall evening with a glass of iced tea in hand. 
Loren Dean gives a wonderfully low-key performance as the mysterious 
young therapist. Although Mumford's name and credentials are phony, 
his intentions are genuine. He cares so much for his patients that he 
dares to speak his mind. When shopaholic mother Althea Brockett (Mary 
McDonnell) complains that "my kids say if I don't get therapy they'll 
have nothing to do with me," he nods and states "Good kids." When 
lethargic patient Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) asks if he believes 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a genuine illness or just a justification 
for doing nothing, he replies, "I don't know what's real and what 
isn't. That's never been my strong suit." 
After Sofie leaves, Mumford goes online to read about CFS and comes 
up with an interesting form of treatment, holding future sessions 
while the two walk though town. Sofie soon finds herself helping the 
doc cover a neighbor kid's paper route, as her energy, spirit and 
affection for the therapist grows ever stronger.
As the film progresses, we learn more about the motivations behind 
Mumford's big deception, and the revelations add poignancy and 
clarity to the character. Loren Dean, whose handsome features have a 
curiously unfinished quality, is an enormously likable actor, aided 
immeasurably by two exceptional supporting players. As Lily, 
Mumford's landlady and friend, Alfre Woodard is earthy and beguiling. 
Although her screen time is limited, she has a presence that lingers 
even when Lily is away running her neighborhood café.
Jason Lee, so deliciously acidic as Banky in "Chasing Amy," gives the 
sunniest performance of his career as Skip Skipperton, a billionaire 
computer mogul who craves friendship so badly that he hires Mumford 
primarily to be his buddy. Despite his wealth, Skip is still just a 
lonesome kid (his corporate headquarters has an elaborate skateboard 
ramp) and Lee is quite effective at blending the character's 
endearing combination of intelligence and naiveté. The role also 
gives the former international skateboard champion a chance to show 
off his considerable skills at the sport. 
I wish the film had spent more time with Mumford, Sofie, Lily and 
Skip, and less on the campaign by a smarmy lawyer (Martin Short) to 
discredit Mumford. Even though there are some amusing moments with 
Short and a pair of therapists (David Paymer and Jane Adams), the 
film could have reached the same conclusion without the subplot. 
Lawrence Kasdan directs his story in a down-to-earth fashion, saving 
visual frills for flashbacks and noirish sequences illustrating the 
pulp fantasies of nebbish pharmacist Henry Follet (Pruitt Taylor 
Vince). Kasdan juggles his vignettes fairly well, although they 
become a bit scattered late in the film. To his credit, an obligatory 
courtroom scene is short, crisp and avoids the usual clichés. James 
Newton Howard provides the music, which consistently accents the tone 
of the story without ever becoming manipulative or overbearing. 
Some critics have savaged "Mumford," calling it nothing but an 
aimless, lackadaisical trifle. While the script might have benefited 
from more polishing, I like what Kasdan has done here. At one point, 
Dr. Mumford wonders aloud if any therapy can really cure problems 
that started in early childhood. Instead, he uses charm, common sense 
and empathy to help those around him grow and feel just a little 
better. After watching "Mumford," I not only felt a little better, I 
was downright happy. This particular trifle turned out to be the 
right treatment for me.

Following the sneak preview of "Erin Brockovich," I listened to a couple
of young men discussing the movie. While agreeing that the film was very
good, they mocked the notion of Julia Roberts playing a down-on-her-luck
working-class woman. As the two prattled on, I fought the urge to
interrupt their conversation and dramatically intone, "Please, don't
hate her because she's beautiful!"
"Erin Brockovich" is an enormously rewarding tale of a real life hero
and Julia Roberts does terrific work in the title role. Renowned
independent film director Steven Soderbergh ("sex, lies and videotape")
has crafted a mainstream film with a realistic feel that manages to
present disturbing facts in a crowd-pleasing fashion without
compromising the integrity of its source material. He also provides
Julia Roberts the best forum for her acting abilities to date. As
Brockovich, an acerbic twice-divorced mother of three, she hits a grand
slam with a vibrant performance crackling with authenticity.
After coming out the loser in a "can't miss" lawsuit over a car
accident, Brockovich badgers her rumpled lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), into giving her a job as a legal assistant. Her coworkers
detest her foul mouth and brash manners, not to mention her insistence
on wearing outrageously sexy outfits more appropriate to a biker bar
than a law office. While her presentation style is abrasive at best,
Brockovich proves to be a fiercely effective employee.
Uncovering some paperwork that just doesn't make sense, Brockovich
visits a tiny California desert town to check out the incongruities. She
learns that a Pacific Gas & Electric plant has been involved in a quiet
campaign to buy off the locals, paying their medical bills and offering
modest sums to purchase their homes. The residents are grateful to the
"caring" corporation, until Brockovich discovers that the area water is
tainted with a toxic chromium rust inhibitor. The chemicals, which the
utility told the people was "good for them," is the likely cause of a
laundry list of horrific medical conditions affecting the haggard
townspeople.
Brockovich takes this information to Masry, who gradually realizes he is
dealing with a lawsuit of potentially historic proportions. The tired
lawyer, in the sunset of his career, is appropriately concerned that he
may lack the resources and energy to take on a corporate giant. But
nonstop badgering from Brockovich results in his reluctant acceptance of
the David versus Goliath case.
If this sounds a lot like 1998's "A Civil Action," it is, but with a
crucial difference in approach. Where "A Civil Action" followed lawyers
and showcased courtroom dramatics, "Erin Brockovich" remains focused on
the people whose lives were devastated by corporate neglect. We watch
Brockovich as she travels from home to home, trying to build and
maintain hope with families beaten down by their various physical
ailments.
But the film is not a downer. By keeping the amazing Brockovich front
and center, Soderbergh gives us a production as entertaining as it is
poignant. Brockovich has a hell of a mouth on her and is given to
gloriously acidic speeches and tart one-liners. But she doesn't know
when to stop and the fiery woman often turns out to her own worst enemy.
Brockovich also is well aware of her good looks and uses sexy clothing
and push-up bras to open doors that would remain closed to most. Roberts
is spectacular in the role, creating a wonderfully three-dimensional
character.
Incidentally, the real Erin Brockovich makes a brief appearance as a
put-upon waitress who offers the fictional Brockovich a bit of advice.
Watch her eyes and listen to her line delivery, and you'll see that
Roberts had a dynamic role model to work from.
Albert Finney proves a grand match to Roberts' lightning and thunder,
reacting magnificently to her take-no-prisoners approach. What a delight
it is to see the veteran actor studying his young charge with
expressions that simultaneously reflect his delight in her impudence and
fear that Ms. Mouth will screw things up.
Aaron Eckhart, lead viper in the indie hit "In the Company of Men" and
self absorbed schlub in "Your Friends and Neighbors," transforms himself
yet again as a good-hearted biker who becomes Brockovich's boyfriend,
only to find himself relegated to being little more than a live-in
baby-sitter as Brockovich grows obsessed with her crusade. Eckhart is
excellent and his role is a welcome reversal on the countless
stand-by-your-man neglected females in other films.
In addition to his obvious rapport with the cast, Soderbergh handles
this big story with great technical skill as well, deliberately
overexposing the desert town scenes and using hand-held cameras to give
personal moments a home-movie intimacy. And, to his credit, he tells the
complex legal tale clearly with, miracle of miracles, only one very
short courtroom scene.
At times, the production becomes overly glib, but even that minor
failing somehow fits, given the style of the main character. "Erin
Brockovich" is the first truly satisfying film of 2000, an inspiring and
terrifically entertaining tale of tenacity and triumph. Don't miss this
one.

The intent of the much anticipated "Beloved" is for viewers to leave the 
theater mesmerized, reflecting on the horror of slavery and its 
nightmarish aftereffects on the human soul. Jonathan Demme's film version 
of the Pulitzer Prize winning Toni Morrison novel achieves those goals to 
a degree, but the effect is somewhat muted by static central characters, 
several notable stylistic and structural problems and the production's 
often glacial pacing. It's been said that truly great films never feel 
too long. At two hours and fifty two minutes, "Beloved" does.
Like many classic chamber dramas, the film is presented "onion-style." 
Following the introduction of the central characters, layer after layer 
of the onion is peeled away, gradually revealing the emotional core of 
the characters. This is a ghost story, both figuratively and literally, 
and Demme opens the film with a lengthy, effective set-up. In 1873, 
former slave Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) and her daughter Denver (Kimberly 
Elise) live a reclusive existence inside a rural home near Cincinnati. 
The house is haunted and the rest of the family has abandoned Sethe long 
ago, yet she refuses to leave. Demme presents the haunting graphically 
with images that echo "Poltergeist"; floorboards and tables rattle, 
objects fly through the air, a dog's eye pops out of its socket. 
Enter Paul D (Danny Glover), who knew Sethe when they were both slaves in 
Kentucky. He encounters the spirit, believed by the women to be the ghost 
of one of Sethe's children, and his strength of will appears to subdue 
the presence. Paul D moves into the house after becoming Sethe's lover 
and, for a brief period, it appears that the three might be able to forge 
a traditional family life. That all changes when Sethe and Denver return 
from a carnival and encounter Beloved (Thandie Newton).
We first see the wild child as she raises from a swampy muck, covered 
with insects, and drags herself to Sethe's front yard. The women take in 
the exhausted near-mute, restoring her to health and attempting to teach 
the drooling, growling creature how to be a proper young adult. While 
Sethe and Denver embrace Beloved, Paul D remains leery, suspecting 
there's more to this feral adolescent than meets the eye. He's right. 
Between Sethe's encounters with Beloved and a series of flashbacks, the 
onion layers begin to peel away. We learn about Sethe's past; the 
horrific treatment she endured as a slave, how she received the criss-
crossed ''tree'' of scars on her back, her delivery of a child while 
traversing the river to Ohio following her escape from Kentucky. We also 
witness the night where, in a desperate attempt to spare her children 
from a life of slavery, Sethe made a decision that hurled her into a 
perpetual nightmare.
''Silence of the Lambs'' director Jonathan Demme employs color 
manipulation, a variety of unusual camera movements and extreme close-ups 
for the powerful imagery required by ''Beloved.'' Sometimes it works, but 
often it does not. It's hard to appreciate a simple front porch 
conversation when Demme's camera is either swooping around the yard or 
flipping between full-screen face shots of whichever character is 
speaking. And while some of the shocking scenes, like Beloved's initial 
appearance, are appropriate, did we really need a close-up of Sethe 
squatting and unleashing a massive stream of urine? 
1873 Cincinnati is beautifully realized, and a carnival scene is both 
charming and wonderfully detailed, but most of the film takes place in 
Sethe's dilapidated home. The flashback sequences are effective, but we 
don't get enough of them, resulting in a portrayal of Sethe's past that 
is unnecessarily sketchy. Demme's insistence on keeping his camera 
focused on Oprah Winfrey, who optioned the book and brought it to the 
screen, eventually gives the film the vague whiff of a vanity project.
''Beloved'' features many exceptional supporting performances, 
particularly from Beah Richards as Denver's grandmother, home-spun 
preacher Baby Suggs. Winfrey and Glover do fine, nuanced work, although 
the static nature of their characters limits their range. Kimberly Elise, 
on the other hand, is allowed to grow and change as young Denver 
graduates from childhood naďveté to become a self-realized woman. Elise 
shines in the role.
The film's most striking performance comes from Thandie Newton as Beloved.
 The lovely actor disappears completely into the part, and is 
appropriately frightening and tragic at first, but as the film drags on, 
her limp-headed, jerky characterization becomes cartoonish, reminding me 
of Gilda Radner's dim-witted rag doll character from the old ''Saturday 
Night Live.'' 
By the time ''Beloved'' finally reaches its conclusion, Demme's 
directorial excesses leave the viewer more exhausted than enlightened. 
Faithful to a fault to the source novel, ''Beloved'' suffers from too 
much exposition without enough details, too many camera games, too few 
flashbacks, too little pay-off at the end and too much Oprah. Within 
''Beloved'' lies a great movie with a powerful message, but its impact is 
muffled due to the filmmakers' indulgence and lack of restraint.

SPOILER WARNING: This article contains references to key plot points. 
Proceed at your own risk.
In several interviews, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon stated their 
belief that "Stepmom" was a poor name for their current film. I agree.
 A much more appropriate title would be "When Bad Movies Happen To 
Good Actors." Watching talents like Roberts, Sarandon and Ed Harris 
mouth virtually every cliché that has ever popped up on the Lifetime 
Channel is beyond embarrassing. Sure, juicy starring roles for women 
are hard to come by, but Julia and Susan, did you actually read this 
script before signing your contracts? As for Ed Harris, I can only 
assume that director Chris Columbus once saved his life and demanded 
that Harris do this movie to repay the debt.  
The story, about the fireworks that come when Dad tries to introduce 
his new love into the lives of his children and ex-wife, exists only 
to allow Sarandon and Roberts a wide berth to strut their stuff. 
"Stepmom" begins as a bitchy relationship drama, then mutates into an 
extremely cheesy tearjerker, with incurable cancer serving as a handy 
device to tie together loose plot threads. The filmmakers are utterly 
shameless in their quest to send you out of the theater drying your 
eyes while saying, "Oh, it was all so sad and so true!" 
In fact, almost everything about "Stepmom" is false. The script isn't 
based on anything actual human beings would ever say. Instead, the 
characters spout lines recycled from other hack movies. For example, 
when daughter Anna (Jena Malone) stomps out of the room during a 
family quarrel and her father shouts, "You do NOT run out on your 
mother," she pivots at just the right moment and snaps back, "No, 
that's YOUR job!" It gets worse. One conversation about Anna between 
doomed earth mother Jackie (Sarandon) and inheritor-to-the-throne 
Isabel (Roberts) ends with Jackie intoning "I have her past, and you 
can have her future." Believe it or not, it took five writers to 
create this drivel.
The plotting is as phony as the dialogue, with every situation 
wrapped up oh-so-tidily by the end of each scene, no matter how much 
contrivance it takes to get there. After all, this is a feel-good 
melodrama and director Columbus is determined not to let reality get 
in the way of his cavalcade of golden moments. How far does he go? 
Well, the film features two touching death-bed scenes without the 
central character actually getting around to dying. Neat trick, eh? 
Speaking of dying, Susan Sarandon's character is really good at it. 
Once Jackie realizes that her cancer is irreversible, she 
choreographs her upcoming demise in grand fashion, sewing 
commemorative capes and quilts like the Martha Stewart of terminal 
illness. Julia's character also orchestrates a number of Kodak 
moments, including one magical scene where she enchants Jackie by 
filling a room with life-sized stand-up photos of the kids. Forget 
the ludicrously extreme preparation time and expense of creating such 
a display. It looks great and that's the only thing that matters.  
In-between the bickering and bonding, Columbus pads the film with 
sing-a-longs, repeated visits to the same restaurant for heart-to-
heart chats, and that most dreaded of all contemporary clichés, the 
"let's celebrate life and love by lip-synching to a golden oldie" 
scene. Oh, the joy, the heartbreak and the schmaltz of it all!
To be fair, the adult actors give it their best. Julia Roberts, 
radiant as always, does what she can with an unevenly-written 
character who fluctuates maddeningly from sharp-as-a-tack 
professional photographer to flummoxed caregiver to infinitely 
resourceful counselor. Susan Sarandon is excellent as the fiercely 
protective mother, while less successful as the martyr du jour. Even 
during the mawkish last hour, though, she manages to provide the only 
genuine moment in the film, when she pauses and surveys a family room 
while her remarkably expressive eyes flash panic over all she is 
about to lose. 
Ed Harris, one of the finest actors in the business, is wasted here, 
disappearing for extremely long stretches of time while the women 
duke it out. And then there's the kids. Jena Malone is suitably 
annoying as Anna and young Liam Aiken, playing her brother Ben, comes 
off more like a very cute toy than an real child. 
Earlier this year, "One True Thing" explored family conflicts, 
reconciliation and the great aching tragedy of terminal illness with 
intelligence, insight and dignity. "Stepmom" takes the same issues 
and cheapens them. Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris earned 
big paychecks appearing in this cloying exercise in manipulation. 
Don't waste part of your check on their error in judgment.

Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)

All icing, no cake. That pretty much sums up "Lethal Weapon 4." Having 
decided that the appeal of the buddy cop franchise was action, jokes and 
the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the powers that be 
apparently decided to discard such antiquated elements as character 
development and coherent plotting, opting instead to create a film of 
virtually nothing but action, jokes and the chemistry between Gibson and 
Glover. And so we have "Lethal Weapon 4," a 127 minute stunt and shtick 
extravaganza. 
In the stunt department, a car crashes into a building, drives through, 
crashes out the other side and continues pursuing the bad guys. Very cool.
 Mel's stunt double climbs from vehicle to vehicle during a high speed 
freeway chase. Jet Li moves quite adroitly while kicking the crap out of 
everybody. There's lots and lots of big explosions too, along with the 
series' trademark sadism.
Moving on to the shtick, Mel plays lots of wacky practical jokes on his 
partner and best friend Danny. He gets him to dance in his underwear to 
"distract" a lunatic. Later, he repeatedly fastens newspaper photos of 
Danny in his underwear to the cubicle walls in the police station. He 
tricks Danny into believing that Chris Rock is gay and infatuated with 
him. And so on.
In-between the jokes and fights, there's a couple of pregnancies thrown 
in, along with a nominal, extremely murky plot about Chinese people doing 
bad things. The film's recurring theme is family, which is nice.
It's all very fast-paced and pretty entertaining on its own terms, but my 
thoughts kept drifting back to the first "Lethal Weapon." I remembered 
the agony of that scene where Gibson, as the suicidal Martin Riggs, sat 
quivering with the barrel of a gun in his mouth, crying tears of 
frustration when he couldn't pull the trigger. I remembered Danny Glover, 
as quintessential family man Roger Murtaugh, nursing his partner through 
his anguish, displaying remarkable nobility and compassion. Sure, "Lethal 
Weapon" was often cheesy and lurid, but I cared about those men.
Watching the fourth installment of the series, I realized how much I 
missed Riggs and Murtaugh, back when they were people instead of the Two 
Stooges. Sure, I laughed at a lot of Gibson's puns and wisecracks, but 
missed the man behind the jokes. With Danny Glover, witnessing his 
sputtering straight man bit actually became embarrassing. At what point 
in the series was it decided that Murtaugh didn't need his dignity 
anymore?
As for the rest of the cast, aside from an absurd, but nifty fight scene, 
Rene Russo is relegated to the background, although she gets more screen 
time than the rest of the womenfolk. Joe Pesci returns as the 
extraordinarily irritating Leo Getz, punctuating his constant yammering 
with his "Okay! Okay!" catch phrase. As if that wasn't annoying enough, 
Chris Rock joins the proceedings with his own shrill brand of fingernails-
on-the-blackboard verbal torture. The nadir of the film comes during a 
scene where Rock and Pesci exchange rapid fire banalities. I swear to God,
 if I'd had an Uzi at that moment I would have happily riddled the screen 
with bullets.
Thankfully, "Lethal Weapon 4" wraps up with a genuinely warm, family 
scrapbook scene that almost makes everything else forgivable. It's as if 
the cast was saying "Folks, we're doing this for the last time. We know 
it's all ridiculous, but we're just having fun and we hope that you had 
some too." And, to a certain extent, I did. But it's hard to watch 
talented performers throw plot, character development, logic and 
credibility away in favor of playing caricatures in a high-octane free-
for-all. I guess I'm just getting too old for this shit.

Think of "Hoosiers," with a science fair subbing for a basketball game as 
the grand finale, and you'll have an idea of what to expect from "October 
Sky," an earnest, inspirational throwback to the pre-ironic days of 
filmmaking. How refreshing to watch idealism and sentimentality presented 
onscreen without the usual cheap manipulative tricks so beloved by 
Hollywood schlockmeisters. Admittedly, "October Sky" is at times a bit 
too pat, but given the sheer good will engendered by the movie, that flaw 
is easy to take.
The story, based on Homer J. Hickam Jr.'s memoir, "Rocket Boys," begins 
on a brisk night in 1957, when the residents of Coalwood, West Virginia 
watch the Russian satellite Sputnik glide across the starry October sky. 
Inspired by the sight, and the U.S. efforts to keep up with their Cold 
War rivals, young Homer Hickam decides to start building rockets of his 
own, much to the dismay of his father, the mine superintendent for the 
company town's only industry. Along with a few friends, Homer forms the 
"Big Creek Missile Agency" and pursues his dream, encouraged by a teacher 
who believes the boys might have a chance of winning the National Science 
Fair in Indianapolis and securing the college scholarships necessary for 
them to escape life in the mines. 
The film has two story arcs, both well-traveled but satisfying 
nonetheless. One is a tale of perseverance, chronicling the boys' dogged 
efforts to succeed through study, experimentation and hard work. The 
other eloquently details one young man's quest to be his own person, even 
while he continues to desperately crave the approval of his father. In a 
letter to his former high school, the real Homer Hickam stated he wrote 
his book "for all of us who watched our parents sacrifice in a million 
ways every day so that we might have a better life. It was written for 
all of us who observed by deed every day how much our parents loved us 
but never experienced it through touch or word." If you found that 
statement corny rather than moving, this may not be the film for you. 
"October Sky" captures the look and feel of a tiny '50s coal-mining town 
so well that the golden-oldies soundtrack seems unnecessary and intrusive.
 The cast does fine work making the town come to life. Laura Dern is 
effective as the boy's teacher and Natalie Canerday gives a great 
performance as Elsie Hickam, a fiercely devoted mother and wife who hates 
Coalwood. Even while battling for her family, she paints a beachside 
mural on the kitchen wall, a small act of defiance against this town of 
soot, hacking coughs and lives of resignation. 
As Homer, Jake Gyllenhaal nicely straddles the line between wide-eyed boy 
and fiery young man. He makes Homer a 20th Century Huck Finn, with a 
personality born of his mother's dreams and his father's backbone. Chris 
Cooper, in the film's most crucial role, plays John Hickam with grit and 
intensity, tempered by a hint of sadness in his eyes. As a superintendent,
 husband and father, John Hickam is firm and not always fair, but he 
truly believes himself a reasonable man operating in the best interests 
of those around him. While you will certainly understand Homer's 
frustration with his father, you'll also realize why he cherishes him so. 
After watching "October Sky," I bought and read "Rocket Boys," partially 
because I wanted to spend more time with the Hickams, but also to check 
the accuracy of the film, which seemed almost too slick to be true. 
Indeed, the movie makes some changes. The six rocket boys in the "Big 
Creek Missile Agency" are condensed into four characters. Homer's mother 
was considerably more assertive, and his father quietly more helpful, 
than portrayed in the film. An incident with the law which casts a pall 
over the boys for a goodly portion of the movie was actually resolved in 
one afternoon. And as for one of the few images in the film that looked 
contrived, a shot of a defeated young Homer gazing upwards at Sputnik 
while a mine elevator lowers him into the bowels of the earth, well, 
let's just call it poetic license and leave it at that.  
The liberties taken by the filmmakers didn't really bother me, though. 
The movie is true to the essence of the book and, most importantly, it 
does not dishonor Homer's parents, John and Elsie Hickam. That matters, 
because it shows that the people behind "October Sky" adhere to the 
values they espouse. As with "Hoosiers," "October Sky" may move some 
facts around and throw in a fictional subplot, but it maintains the 
integrity of the true story behind the celluloid.

I went into "Jack Frost" expecting the worst. The trailers for the 
fantasy, about a father who returns from the dead as a snowman, looked 
absolutely awful, promising a mawkish comedy with exceptionally cheesy 
special effects. The actual movie certainly lived up (or down, if you 
wish) to its ads, but I was moved anyway. Beneath the many mistakes in 
"Jack Frost" lies a sweet story with a kind spirit and a nice message. If 
you're willing to suffer through the bad stuff, the film actually offers 
some rewards.  
Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost, a musician in a small Colorado town 
who wants to be a good father and husband, but keeps screwing up, 
repeatedly missing important family events while trying to hit it big in 
show business. His wife Gabby (Kelly Preston) and son Charlie (Joseph 
Cross) recognize his good intentions, but are often hurt by his actions. 
While traveling towards a Christmas Day audition, he has an epiphany and 
turns around, heading for home to be with his loved ones. Then a 
snowstorm hits and Jack dies in a car wreck.
A year later, young Charlie is still a mess. He's quit the school hockey 
team and trudges through his days, sad and uncommunicative. Then it 
happens. Charlie wistfully blows on a harmonica that his father told him 
was magic ("No matter where I am, I'll hear it") and that night, the 
snowman in the front yard comes to life, inhabited by the soul of Jack 
Frost.
The results are predictable. Fear and disbelief, followed by wacky madcap 
adventures leading to a sentimental finale. The film is poorly executed, 
both visually and structurally. The machine-made snow throughout the town 
looks almost as phony as the instant mashed potato flakes often used as a 
snow substitute in movies. The snowman itself is unconvincing, resembling 
white felt more than snow, and the computer animation is very hokey. 
The script is as bad as the special effects. Kelly Preston and Mark Addy 
(playing a former band-mate and family friend) are given passive, 
woefully underwritten characters with little to do. Henry Rollins oozes 
testosterone as Charlie's coach, who spots the snowman in action and 
becomes the laughing stock of the town when he tells what he saw. 
Rollins' blustery character seems bound for a major comic payoff, but the 
punchline never comes. 
In fact, a lot of punchlines never come. For a comedy, there aren't 
nearly enough gags in "Jack Frost." The physical humor is more frenetic 
than funny, with poor camera angles undercutting the laughs. The jokes 
are standard-issue kid's stuff; one-liners about butts, a kid getting 
whacked in the testicles, etc.
On the sentimental side, the film strains mightily for a Frank Capra feel.
 Aside from the off-screen car wreck and the aforementioned shot to the 
crotch, unusually spirited snowball fights are about as violent as the 
story gets. Every character is essentially a decent human being, a nice 
change from the parade of creeps who populate so many movies. Even the 
school bully eventually comes around, in one of the tale's most agreeable 
scenes. 
While the tearjerker elements of "Jack Frost" sometimes become 
excessively gooey, particularly in one cloying scene that rips-off the 
climax of "Ghost," the film has moments that are honestly touching. 
Despite the ludicrous spectacle of a boy hugging a snowman, the 
relationship between Jack and Charlie feels genuine. I enjoyed the 
heartfelt father and son bonding, and thought the gentle lessons on 
dealing with the death of a loved one were poignant. To be fair, I should 
mention that I recently lost one of my parents, which may render me more 
susceptible to overt sentiment than usual.   
"Jack Frost" is a sloppy, manipulative film, just another holiday trifle. 
But credit should be given to the filmmakers. Underneath the bells and 
whistles, and despite flubbing many opportunities, they have crafted a 
Christmas movie in the cynical late '90s that actually has a heart.

The first is about Mark Wahlberg, a punk kid convicting of assaulting a
man and costing him an eye. Instead of becoming a career criminal,
Wahlberg redeems himself, going on to fame and fortune as the leader of
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. When the group's sales begin to fade, he
finds a new line of work and even more attention as an underwear model
for Calvin Klein. Like so many other pop singers and models, Wahlberg
then decides to pursue a career in acting and, against all odds, he
becomes a full-fledged movie star. From street thug to matinee idol 
what are the odds?
The second fairy tale is about Tim "Ripper" Owens, an office supply
salesman from Ohio. In his spare time, Tim sang his heart out as lead
vocalist in a Judas Priest tribute band, hitting the stage nightly to
cover songs by his all-time favorite group. One day, he gets a phone
call from his heroes. Rob Halford, frontman for Judas Priest, has left
the group and the rest of the band, having watched a video of Owens
performing, want him to take Halford's place. From office supply
salesman to rock star  who would ever have thought?
"Rock Star" brings the two real-life fairy tales together, with Wahlberg
playing a character loosely based on Owens. The movie is nothing
special; once Chris Coles' (Wahlberg) fantasy turns real and he is
invited to join the British heavy metal band, Steel Dragon, the story
falls into a pattern that is oh-so-familiar to anyone who has watched
VH1's "Behind the Music."
Still, the early part of the film is a hoot and Wahlberg is delightful.
In fact, for the first time in his acting career, he carries the movie,
passionately defending his beloved band to others, nearly coming to
blows with a singer in another band over the authenticity of a jacket,
and unsuccessfully trying to contain his puppy dog grin during his first
photo session with Steel Dragon.
Alas, Jennifer Aniston does not fare so well. As Emily, Chris'
girlfriend and manager, she is supposed to be more level-headed than her
beau, but at times she comes off overly parental, more like a kindly
schoolmarm than a lover or business person. Aniston has an undeniable
talent, but it is not tapped in this film.
"Rock Star" might have seemed brighter had it not been released in the
long shadow of "Almost Famous," which covers many of the same themes
with far more skill. As is, the film is a minor pleasure, with a strong
first half, a tepid second half and a hell of a performance from Mark
Wahlberg.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
The journey from TV to movie stardom has not been smooth for Matthew
Perry. As the wisecracking Chandler Bing on "Friends," Perry comes off
as the smartest and most edgy of the ensemble cast. But in his previous
big screen starring efforts ("Fools Rush In," "Three To Tango" and the
dreadful "Almost Heroes"), Perry's charisma dissipated on celluloid.
Although playing variations of his television persona, he seemed oddly
bleached out  effete and bland, almost wispy.
In "The Whole Nine Yards," Perry finally appears to have found his
cinematic footing. As dentist, bedraggled husband and put upon good guy
Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky, he displays a sense of backbone  tenuous at
first, but stronger as the film goes on  that gives his one-liners and
pratfalls more oomph.
Of course, it helps that Oz is one of only two decent human beings in
this dark comedy. Surrounded by amiable hitmen who whack their own
friends as casually as one would swat a fly, he provides a welcome moral
center that makes the overwhelming nihilism of the story tolerable. As
in the classic "Arsenic and Old Lace," lovable killers can be a lot of
fun, provided you have at least one character that fully recognizes that
what they are doing is wrong.
Indeed, Oz spends most of the movie surrounded by people doing wrong.
While enduring the constant disdain of his dour bride, Sophie (Patricia
Arquette), he recognizes his new neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Bruce Willis), a contract killer recently sprung from prison after
ratting out his former gangland employers. Refusing the witness
protection program despite the fact that there is a price on his head,
Tudeski maintains an assured, cheerful attitude while sharing his
peculiar outlook on life to Oz. "It's not important how many people I've
killed," he explains pleasantly, "What's important is how I get along
with the people that are still alive."
I won't recount the elaborate plotting of Mitchell Kapner's screenplay.
Suffice to say that Oz, badgered by his wife into making a very bad
decision, quickly finds himself up to his ears in trouble, with any
number of people out to kill him. Questionable allegiances, along with
double and triple crossings, make up the bulk of "The Whole Nine Yards,"
providing a surprising amount of snappy entertainment. While humor
periodically takes a backseat to the mechanics of the elaborate farce,
the production never loses steam.
Savvy casting is key to the success of the film. Bruce Willis hits the
right notes as Tudeski, blending a congenial nature with a strong sense
of menace. Willis works beautifully with Perry, building an affectionate
relationship with his new neighbor, while making it clear that he'll
kill him in a heartbeat if need be. Michael Clarke Duncan, fresh from
his breakout role as the gentle giant in "The Green Mile," is wonderful
as a suave Chicago hitman, and Amanda Peet steals the show as Jill, a
perky dental assistant with unusual career aspirations.
Other performers fare less well, mostly because of accents. Kevin
Pollack, playing a gangland boss, affects a weird speech impediment that
wears thin fast and Patricia Arquette, as the unrelenting harridan, uses
a French accent that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play.
Director Jonathan Lynn does hit and miss work here. While he handles his
lead actors with skill, he has problems behind the camera. To his
credit, he moved the story setting from Miami to Montreal, choosing not
to do the usual "Hey, we're filming in Canada to save money, but lets
pretend it's a U.S. city" nonsense. But man, does he make Montreal look
industrial and dreary. Lynn also overuses close-ups and awkward camera
angles. Luckily, Randy Edelman's jazzy score makes the technical
glitches easier to take.
In a winter that has offered a numbing string of lousy movies, "The
Whole Nine Yards" is a zippy, nasty little change of pace. And for
Matthew Perry, it offers evidence that there may be life beyond
"Friends" after all.

"Atlantis: The Lost Empire," the latest feature-length cartoon from
Disney, is an adventure story offering a smooth blend of traditional
drawing and computer animation, top-notch voice work from an impressive
cast and lots of action. In addition, there are no cheesy musical
numbers or adorable animal sidekicks. On the surface (if you'll pardon
the expression), it sounds likes a can't-miss enterprise, but the
finished product is merely serviceable. "Atlantis" suffers from an
over-familiar storyline, underdeveloped characters and a surprising lack
of imagination, especially in the all-important visuals.
Everything in the production appears to be culled from other Disney
movies. The humans look like refugees from the animated "101
Dalmatians," while the Atlanteans appear to be first cousins of "The
Little Mermaid." Add a submarine that would fit in "20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea" and mystical spinning crystals reminiscent of the central
controller in "Tron" and you start wondering if the artists from the
other films will receive royalty payments for this one.
Then there's the matter of Atlantis itself. One of the most enduring
legends of all time, the fabled city that disappeared beneath the sea
cries out for overkill. Atlantis should be an opulent vista of majestic
buildings stretching as far as the eye can see. Flowing ivy should
entwine the massive pillars supporting the exotic and ornate structures.
Atlantis should look like a combination of ancient Rome and the Emerald
City from Oz. Instead, we get shots of what looks like a grandiose
office complex. Where's the magic? Where's the wonder? Trust me, ladies
and gentlemen, Donovan would never have written a song about this place.
As for what happens in the office complex, here's the skinny. Following
a prologue depicting the sinking of Atlantis, the story jumps to 1914,
where we meet scrawny linguist and map expert Milo Thatch (voiced by
Michael J. Fox), a young man obsessed with the lost kingdom. His boss
(David Ogden Stiers) and coworkers dismiss the museum curator as a
crackpot, but Milo remains a true believer; after all, his grandfather
once told him about the mysterious Shepherd's Journal, said to contain
the secret to locating Atlantis.
Enter billionaire Preston B. Whitmore (John Mahoney), who has the book
and wants Milo to join an expedition to the mythic land. In short order,
the kid ends up in a Captain Nemo-style submarine with a ragtag (is
there any other kind?) group of mercenaries. Heading the crew is brawny
Commander Rourke (James Garner) and his tough lieutenant Helga Sinclair
(Claudia Christian), along with dirt-covered geologist Gaetan Moliere
(Corey Burton), affectionately called "Mole"; Mrs. Packard (Florence
Stanley), a chain-smoking radio operator; droll demolitions expert Vinny
Santorini (Don "Father Guido Sarducci" Novello); fast-talking Dr. Sweet
(Phil Morris); Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors), a no-nonsense
mechanic; and a crusty cook known as  what else  Cookie (the late Jim
Varney).
The crew nearly meets their end early on when a violent encounter with
the Leviathan, a giant Crustacean-like machine, results in the
destruction of the sub. Scrambling into escape pods, the team continues
the adventure, following the directions in the Journal. They eventually
discover the lost city, only to find it is still inhabited. Atlantis
lives, courtesy of a crystal energy that provides the denizens light,
power and the ability to heal.
Milo and company meet Princess Kida (Cree Summer), a radiant being who
takes them to meet her father, the King (Leonard Nimoy), who immediately
orders them to leave. They do and the story is over. Just kidding. To no
surprise, certain members of the expedition have ulterior motives,
leading to a kidnapping, lots of fighting and a heaping pile of New Age
hooey.
The New Age stuff fits in with Disney's intense desire to be all things
to all people. The expedition, a rainbow coalition of sexes, races and
ethnic groups, reflects the same mindset, although the gang contains a
number of stereotypes. What's the deal with the filthy Frenchman? Do all
Latin women in cartoons have to sound like Rosie Perez? Must all black
male characters be gruff, but gentle giants? And does the leading man
always have to be white?
Continuing a long-standing Disney tradition, parents are an endangered
species here. Milo is an orphan (Disney loves orphans) and, while I
don't want to reveal specifics about the fates of Princess Kida's mom
and dad, it is safe to say that by the end of the film her Christmas
list is shorter.
Given the scarcity of big screen family material, "Atlantis: The Lost
Empire" will likely draw a huge audience. Admittedly, the movie is light
years better than most of the junk currently being cranked out for
children, and the filmmakers deserve credit for avoiding gross-out
humor, but this production nonetheless remains a minor league affair.
Incidentally, if you think I'm being unduly hard on "Atlantis," remember
this: With their stellar list of creations, it was Disney that set the
quality bar so high. Now it's their responsibility to live up to their
own standards.

Review for Great Expectations (1998)
Great Expectations (1998)
Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Robert DeNiro, Chris Cooper, 
Hank Azaria. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. 111 minutes.
Rated R, 1.5 stars (out of five stars)

Remember when you were a kid and went shopping for a Mothers Day gift at 
the drugstore? Your eyes would invariably land on the most elaborate 
package; a huge red velvet heart-shaped box of candy, with gold-edging, 
lace and ribbons. To a child, it was dazzling, but most adults recognized 
it as just a large, garish box of cheap sweets. "Great Expectations" is 
like that. Wildly ornate and covered with lace and ribbons, it 
desperately tries to look classy, but you quickly identify it for what it 
is; a great big heart-shaped box full of nothing.
Loosely based on the Charles Dickens classic, "Great Expectations" is 
aimed at romantics. Set in contemporary times, it strives to be a hip, 
tragic love story, but is so excessive and inept that it falls flat on 
its tortured little face. Ethan Hawke plays Finn, an artist raised by his 
sister's boyfriend (Chris Cooper) in a fishing village on Florida's Gulf 
Coast. As a boy, he once showed kindness to an escaped convict (Robert 
DeNiro) and never told anyone about the bizarre encounter. Shortly after, 
he was summoned to the decaying mansion of a rich, crazy old lady (Anne 
Bancroft,) where he became the designated playmate for her beautiful, 
snobby niece. Naturally, he immediately fell madly in love with the girl.
Cut to the 80s. Finn works as a commercial fisherman, burying his 
anguished memories of the lovely Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow,) who went away 
to school in Europe after rebuffing his advances again and again. Out of 
nowhere, a lawyer appears with a gift for the angst-ridden young man. 
Finn has a benefactor, who provides tickets to New York and everything 
Finn needs to break onto the city's art scene in grand fashion. 
Reluctantly, he heads for the Big Apple, where he finds wealth, success 
and, of course, the haughty Estella, now in the arms of another man. 
Visually, "Great Expectations" is a textbook example of art direction 
overkill. Every scene is dripping with chintzy style and framed to 
postcard perfection. Even the rotting mansion looks like the set for a 
MTV video, with glorious decay arranged oh-so-carefully to maximize the 
lush romanticism. Flocks of birds take off at just the right moments, 
while the overbearing soundtrack, a blend of thick strings and 
alternative rock, attempts to bully an emotional response from the viewer.
Of the many over-the-top visuals, the most outrageous comes midway 
through the film, as Finn walks the New York streets, devastated that 
Estella is flying away with her fiancee. Finn looks up at the clouds in 
the night sky, beautifully backlit by the moon. Suddenly, the camera 
sweeps upwards through the clouds to a computer generated airplane, 
whooshing right up to one of the plane's windows, where Estella gazes 
wistfully into the darkness. The scene is stunningly cheesy, so much so 
that one is almost tempted to admire the filmmakers for their sheer 
brazenness. Almost. Director Alfonso Cuaron's audacious style is 
certainly memorable, but that doesn't make it good.
And then there's the acting. You won't forget Anne Bancroft as the 
whacked-out Nora Dinsmoor. Bedecked in flowing dresses and enough make-up 
to embarrass Tammy Faye Bakker, Bancroft sweeps about the screen 
grotesquely, overacting while the camera takes every opportunity to focus 
on her wrinkles. She comes off like a drag queen doing a bad impression 
of Norma Desmond from "Sunset Boulevard." Robert DeNiro acquits himself 
nicely as the escaped convict, though it's hard to fathom why he agreed 
to perform in this trifle. 
Ethan Hawke spends the bulk of his screen time squinting with his mouth 
hanging open. In most scenes, he behaves as if he was struck in the head 
with a piece of lumber a few minutes earlier and is just beginning to 
regain his senses. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, there's not much to say. The 
centerpiece of the film is an extended scene where she poses in the nude 
for Finn. It's supposed to be haunting and erotic, but the effect is 
lessened because posing is only thing Paltrow does during the entire 
movie. Repeatedly, she strides into a scene, toys with Finn's emotions, 
then leaves abruptly. Paltrow does the abrupt exit bit so often that it 
becomes almost laughable. It's reminiscent of Elizabeth Berkley in 
"Showgirls," who left virtually every scene by spinning on her heels and 
walking off in a huff. The preening Estella may be beautiful, but Finn's 
devotion to this aloof ice queen just makes him seem obsessive and 
shallow. 
"Great Expectations" is a mess, a lurid romance with flashy imagery 
substituting for genuine emotion. Rent the superb 1946 version of 
Dickens' story from your video store and stay away from this oversized, 
overwrought heart-shaped box of goo.

Review for People vs. Larry Flynt, The (1996)
The People Vs. Larry Flynt (1996)
Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, Edward Norton, Brett Harrelson, James 
Cromwell, Crispin Glover. Directed by Milos Forman
Rated R, **** stars (out of *****)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

In one scene from "The People Vs. Larry Flynt," the Hustler Magazine 
publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally. As graphic photos 
flash on a huge screen behind him, Flynt strides confidently across the 
stage, delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity.
 The spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in "Patton" where the General 
spoke in front of a giant American flag. Both scenes were stirring, 
larger than life, richly entertaining, and felt totally like contrived 
set pieces for big Hollywood movies. Overall, that sums up "The People Vs.
 Larry Flynt." The film is a wildly entertaining hoot which, despite 
being based on fact, feels like a big, phony Hollywood movie. 
The son of a Kentucky moonshiner, Flynt (Woody Harrelson) ran away from 
home and ended up operating strip clubs in Cincinnati. There he met 
Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), a bisexual stripper who became his fourth 
wife and the love of his life. To bolster interest in his clubs, he 
started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into Hustler magazine. 
Flynt, along with the magazine's rag-tag management team, headed by his 
brother Jimmy (played nicely by Woody's real-life brother, Steak & Shake 
commercial veteran Brett Harrelson), viewed Playboy magazine with 
contempt. They mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos, striving 
to keep Hustler focused on "what guys really want," explicit photos that 
would make a gynecologist squirm, and extremely crude humor. The film's 
prime example of Hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters 
from The Wizard Of Oz in an orgy, giving the audience an opportunity to 
giggle at Flynt's "naughtiness." Director Milos Forman conveniently 
ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child 
molestation, racism, and endless scatological cartoons. 
Flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude 
photos of Jacqueline Onassis, which brought the magazine international 
attention, big money and the attention of conservatives. An obscenity 
bust followed, the first in a long series of battles between Flynt and 
the law. Lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) enters the scene, hired by 
Flynt's wife. Norton, an exceptional actor, is wonderful as the 
beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with 
Flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior. In court, we meet the 
sputtering conservatives, headed by Citizens For Decency leader Charles 
Keating (James Cromwell.) As Keating blathers about Flynt's immorality, 
the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag, inviting the 
audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by Keating, 
who was later convicted in a $2 billion S&L fraud. Flynt's other prime 
foe is Rev. Jerry Falwell, who sues over a Hustler parody involving him 
and his mother having sex in an outhouse. 
Tragedy strikes as Flynt is shot by a would-be assassin, leaving him 
paralyzed from the waist down. A dark period follows, as Flynt and 
Leasure hole up in an L.A. suite, strung out on pain killers. Flynt 
eventually kicks drugs, but Leasure succumbs to addiction, and later, 
AIDS. After watch Falwell on TV, describing AIDS as a punishment from God,
 Flynt directs his lawyer to take the Falwell case to the Supreme Court, 
leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene.
"The People Vs, Larry Flynt" is at its weakest when moralizing on free 
speech and lionizing Flynt. "If they'll protect a scumbag like me, then 
they'll protect all of you," declared Flynt. He's right, of course, but 
the director Forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more 
than hypocritical buffoons. He also cheats in casting Woody Harrelson as 
Flynt. Harrelson is an attractive, charismatic man, and his strong 
performance paints Flynt as a colorful folk hero. Even a cursory look at 
the real Flynt, who is making the talk show circuit, and plays the judge 
in an early courtroom scene, shows a bloated, morose and bitter man. An 
accurate portrayal of Flynt would have made a more difficult film to 
watch, but a richer one.
Despite its flaws, "Flynt" is a fast moving, rousing movie with some 
terrific acting, especially by Courtney Love, whose vibrant performance 
will likely garner an Oscar nod. The story may be candy-coated, but it's 
still delicious candy.

The press kit for Disney's computer animated children's movie,
"Dinosaur," contains eight pages of cast and crew biographies, nine
pages of credits and 15 pages of production notes. Included in the
copious technical section is one paragraph on the actual story, which
reveals a lot about the filmmakers' priorities. "Dinosaur" is a 75
minute (82 with closing credits) showcase for computer animation, with a
standard issue Disney storyline slapped on. And, despite the jazzy
visuals, it's a surprisingly mundane affair.
Of course, the very young target audience for the movie will love every
minute of it, but then again, they also look at Lunchables as fine
dining.
Set in the late Cretaceous Period, "Dinosaur" chronicles the adventures
of Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), an Iguanodon raised by a family of
frolicking lemurs after his egg turns up on their island paradise. A
meteor shower forces them to flee to the mainland, where they join a
diverse group of dinosaurs trudging across the ravaged land seeking a
new nesting ground. Aladar's insistence on staying with caravan
stragglers like the slow-moving Brachiosaur, Baylene (Joan Plowright),
and the brassy Styrachosaur, Eema (Della Reese), draws the ire of
Iguanodon herd leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), even though his sister,
Neera (Julianna Margulies), clearly considers the rebellious young
dinosaur to be quite a stud.
Think Disney's "Tarzan" minus the exuberance and "The Lion King" with
less majesty and you'll know what to expect from the retread plot. Think
fuzzy wuzzy and you'll understand the story's philosophy. In the press
notes, Margulies states, "The film has a beautiful message, especially
for younger viewers, that it's so much cooler to help the weak ones than
to go along with the bully who hates everyone and can be mean just
because he's more powerful." The villain of which she speaks is Kron,
and his crime is driving the herd to a safe haven, even if it means
leaving behind those who can't keep pace. Apparently, Disney-think
allows no room for distasteful concepts like survival of the fittest.
But enough carping over plot and philosophy  after all, this is a film
concerned primarily with cute characters and dazzling visuals.
"Dinosaur" strives to raise the bar for computer animation, placing CG
characters in real world settings. The production's first unit shot in
California's Mohave Desert and in Hawaiian botanical gardens, along with
other sites on the Big Island, Maui and Kauai, while the second unit
captured images in Australia, Jordan, Venezuela and the beaches of
Western Samoa. Animators studied light and shadow with great care,
attempting to seamlessly insert their computer generated creations into
real backdrops.
Their success rate varies from scene to scene. Some composite images are
crisp, sharply defined and remarkably convincing, while others have a
creamy, storybook appearance that is far less credible, but still
attractive. The most impressive shots are close-ups where the animators
obviously strained to break new ground. In the past, computer renditions
of water and hair generally ranged from barely passable to flat-out
cheesy, but "Dinosaur" gets them right. For scenes of a soggy lemur, fur
stylist Charles Colladay dealt with both, explaining "To study wet hair,
I experimented at home by wetting down my cats to see what they looked
like. The hair comes to thousands of little points and you can see the
skin in-between. That gave us some direction to go in and we came up
with a hair-clumping tool where we could actually grab a single hair on
the computer and clump a bunch of others to our target hair. We went to
the zoo to study real lemurs, but they kind of frowned on us wetting
them down."
Even though "Dinosaur" periodically breaks new ground, the film suffers
from a been-there, done-that feel. Ads for the film trumpet, "You've
never seen anything like this before!" Apparently, they forgot about a
little feature called "Jurassic Park." When Laura Dern and Sam Neill
first saw a dinosaur grazing in the sunshine, rising on its hind legs to
snatch some leaves from the top of a tree, my jaw dropped as far as
theirs did. I never experienced that sensation during "Dinosaur." I've
no doubt that kids will go wild over the movie, but for this adult, the
grafting of grandiose images to a Sesame Street storyline left me cold.
Scientists theorize that dinosaurs became extinct as a result of Earth
being struck by an asteroid. After sitting through this tepid spectacle,
I wonder if they simply died of boredom.

As part of the pre-release hype for "Pearl Harbor," World War II vets
attended screenings of the film and then voiced their reactions to the
press. To no surprise, they were enthralled by the production. One
soldier expressed his decades-old fear that the memory of Pearl Harbor
would fade from the public consciousness. He was no longer concerned,
though, for this epic film was a guarantee that he and his comrades
would never be forgotten. Watching the parade of aged veterans before
the cameras was stirring  stirring enough to make it seem vaguely
unpatriotic to criticize such a noble endeavor.
If "Pearl Harbor" bolsters the legacy of those men and women, that's
wonderful, but it should not obscure the fact that the three-hour saga
isn't a very good movie. Intended to tap into the lucrative "Titanic"
audience, "Pearl Harbor" is two-thirds cheesy love story and one-third
fireworks extravaganza. Imagine a vintage Grade B WW II romance with
state of the art special effects, edited by someone with attention
deficient disorder, and you'll have an idea of what to expect.
The tale follows Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) as the
best-friends-since-childhood become pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps.
Rafe falls in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a dedicated nurse,
shortly before volunteering to travel to England and fight in the Battle
of Britain. Shot down by enemy aircraft, he is mistakenly reported as
dead. After a mourning period, Danny and Evelyn become a couple.
Of course, Rafe reappears in their life, leading to exactly what you
would expect. The high drama between the three is interrupted when the
Japanese launch their staggering assault on Pearl Harbor. Later, both
men must leave Evelyn, this time to take part in a daring retaliatory
raid. Let into command headquarters by a sympathetic officer, the
terrified nurse listens to air reports of the attack that might rob her
of the two most important men in her life.
Comparisons between "Pearl Harbor" and "Titanic" don't hold up. The love
story in "Titanic" worked because the young man and woman served as
representatives for all the souls onboard the disaster-bound ship. They
were the embodiment of the hopes and dreams that were cut short when the
massive boat went under. The romantic triangle between Rafe, Danny and
Evelyn lacks that resonance. These characters are cut from the pages of
a cheap paperback. When Evelyn describes the first time she met Rafe,
her girlfriends listen raptly, giggling too hard at just the right
moments because they are supporting players and that is their job. When
Rafe and Danny race to try and stem the initial Japanese assault, each
man's survival is assured because an old-time hero cannot die unless he
is making a noble sacrifice in the final reel.
The battle scenes are just what you would expect from Michael Bay, the
director of "Armageddon". The film jumps like lightning from one action
image to the next, with jiggling cameras attempting to create a sense of
verisimilitude as planes whoosh by in breathtaking fashion and
weapons-fire explodes all around. Every few seconds, the screen fills
with carefully composed panoramas of the devastation being wrought from
above. The big money shot follows a Japanese bomb as it drops from the
plane and plummets into a United States ship, resulting in a massive
explosion.
It's an extremely cool visual, which is precisely the problem. In a film
that is supposed to be honoring the men and women of Pearl Harbor,
should we be oohing and aahing as we watch them die? The battle scenes
in "Saving Private Ryan" put us right in the middle of the nightmare of
combat. "Pearl Harbor" is a throwback to the war-as-spectacle school of
filmmaking and, at least for me, that is no longer viable.
Incidentally, Bay's tendency to whoosh is not confined to the battles.
Even during the gentle moments, his cameras repeatedly glide alongside,
below and above the actors. The crane operators for this movie must have
made a fortune. Bay doesn't know when to lighten up, and neither does
the bullying orchestral score, which attempts to force emotions up the
audience ear. On the positive side, while the idyllic vistas in the
early scenes are too perfect to be believed, they are nonetheless quite
lovely, using the color palate well.
Within this cavalcade of overkill are a group of talented actors. When a
British officer asks Rafe if all Yanks are "so anxious to die," the
airman replies, "Not anxious to die, sir, anxious to matter." That Ben
Affleck is able to keep a straight face while delivering that hack line
is a tribute to his skill. As Danny, Josh Hartnett hits the right notes
and Kate Beckinsale is quite striking as Evelyn. Other cast members play
characters based on real people. In a crucial supporting role, Jon
Voight is flat-out amazing as FDR, totally disappearing into the persona
of the commander-in-chief. Alec Baldwin breathes life to aviation legend
Jimmy Doolittle, despite being saddled with a nonstop barrage of lines
straight from Cliché Central. Allotted criminally short screen time is
Cuba Gooding Jr., who gives a restrained performance as Doris "Dorie"
Miller, the first black soldier to be honored in WW II.
Even though it rips off a slew of other movies and tries to turn war
into a thrill ride, "Pearl Harbor" deserves credit for honoring the work
of nurses and, albeit briefly, servicemen of color, in addition to white
male veterans. It also deserves credit for treating the Japanese fairly
and for showing, if only for a split second, the bigotry aimed at
Asian-Americans. "Pearl Harbor" is not an awful movie. It is simply
another example of what happens when a film is made by technicians
instead of artists.

"Holy Man" boasts a sweet, gentle, comic performance from an unusually 
subdued Eddie Murphy and a few moderately funny skits. Unfortunately, to 
get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set-up, 
loads of tedious filler, interminable shots of Jeff Goldblum stammering 
and twitching, a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most 
annoying performance of Robert Loggia's career. If ever a movie screamed 
"Wait for video so you can fast-forward through all the dull and annoying 
parts," this is it. 
Eddie Murphy plays G, a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying 
the moment and spreading his spiritual message. A chance meeting with 
Ricky Hayman (Goldblum), a stressed-out executive of a home-shopping 
channel, and Kate Newell (Kelly Preston), a no-nonsense media analyst, 
results in physical injury to G. Quicker than you can say "The Odd Couple,
" G ends up rooming with an extremely leery Ricky. After some script 
gymnastics, G appears live on the air at the Good Buy Shopping Network, 
wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations, enraging network 
owner Mr. McBainbridge (Loggia), and becoming a national media sensation. 
"Holy Man" attempts to be several things at once. It tries to satirize 
home shopping networks, but it's difficult to effectively make fun of 
something that is already a self-parody. The film attempts to teach us 
that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill 
the spiritual holes in our hearts, but that's common knowledge already. 
"Holy Man" also tries to present a story of redemption, as Ricky Hayman 
tries to decide whether to exploit G's good will to achieve financial 
security or do the right thing at the expense of his career. Anyone want 
to place a wager on his final decision?
The one genuine asset in "Holy Man" is Eddie Murphy, who gives a charming 
performance, sharing love, good will and relevant advice to all those 
around him, while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right 
moments. Murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he's 
onscreen. 
Unfortunately, he's not onscreen enough. Jeff Goldblum gets the lion's 
share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down. 
As his potential love interest, Kelly Preston tries to brighten things up,
 but she transforms from an all-business media shark to an empathic softy 
far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance. The other 
principal actor, Robert Loggia, wastes his talents in a one-note turn as 
a ruthless, screaming monster.
Structurally unsound and way too long, "Holy Man" is appealing when 
Murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn't. Instead of dropping your money 
at the theater for this trifle, wait until it hits video and fast-forward 
past everything except the Murphy scenes. G suggests that we focus on 
enjoying the moment and that's the best way to do so.

I saw Terrence McNally's LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! on Broadway a couple 
of summers ago. I'd already purchased tickets for Dan Butler's 
outstanding one man show "THE ONLY THING WORSE YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME" 
and only had time to see one other play while in New York. Here's how I 
selected L!V!C! I read the theater listings on the Internet, looking for 
gay plays with male nudity. There were two major ones and the postings I 
read indicated that both featured about the same amount of flesh. L!V!C! 
had won the Tony for best play and I thought "Great! Art AND dicks!" 
There, now you know how shallow I am. 
The simple truth is that lots of guys are just like me and theatrical 
productions exploit that to the hilt. Many mediocre plays, both gay and 
straight, have enjoyed long profitable runs by tossing in lots of nudity. 
When I left the theater after three long hours of LOVE! VALOUR! 
COMPASSION!, I reflected on the experience. I'd had a fine time looking 
at the naked guys, particularly Randy Becker as a Puerto Rican dancer, 
and an awful time suffering through the actual play. That a production as 
mawkish and gimmicky as this won a Tony flattened me. If this was the 
best drama, Broadway must have had a terrible year.
Now LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! is a movie, with the Broadway cast intact, 
save for Nathan Lane being replaced by SEINFELD's Jason Alexander. L!V!C! 
the movie is definitely better than L!V!C! the play. For one thing, it's 
an hour shorter, and the editing helps. And, being a movie, you get a 
much better view of the naked guys.
Set at a secluded Victorian house on the edge of a beautiful lake, L!V!C! 
tells of eight gay men who gather over three holiday weekends one summer. 
The house belongs to Gregory (Stephen Bogardus,) a middle-aged 
choreographer and his younger, blind lover Bobby (Justin Kirk.) Their 
guests include John (John Glover,) a bitter English composer, and his 
current boy toy Ramon (the aforementioned Becker;) John's twin brother 
James, who is HIV+ and as sweet as his brother is surly (the twins' last 
name is Jeckyll...too clever, eh?;) Buzz (Alexander,) a flamboyant show 
tune aficionado; and Arthur (John Benjamin Hickey) and Perry (Stephen 
Spinella,) a couple celebrating fourteen years together. 
The men hang out and mostly spout the kind of theatrical chatter that you 
would never hear in real life. The continuing relationship of the group 
is puzzling. John is intensely hateful at every conceivable opportunity, 
yet he gets invited back. Ramon has a brief affair with Bobby that nearly 
destroys Bobby and Gregory's relationship, yet he gets invited back. Two 
of the guys are caught hiding in a closet eavesdropping on a painful 
encounter between John and Ramon, yet they get invited back. These men 
are either far more forgiving than anyone I've ever met or simply 
gluttons for punishment.
L!V!C! has its pleasures. The dialogue, windy though it may be, is often 
funny and occassionally very touching. Jason Alexander gives a strong 
performance. Initially he appears to be doing an impression of Nathan 
Lane, but after a few minutes he seems to find his footing and makes the 
character his own. Despite being saddled with the twin roles, John Glover 
almost succeeds in making the viewer forget the gimmick. His James is a 
particularly nice creation; bedecked in flowing clothes and a straw sun 
bonnet, James is a painfully kind and loving person. A flowering romance 
between him and Buzz is one of the highlights of the story. 
L!V!C! deserves credit for presenting a non-stereotypical, intimate 
portrait of a group of gay men to a mainstream audience. It's a shame 
though, that for the most part, these guys are boring. Not much happens 
in L!V!C!, and aside from Alexander and Glover's characters, the men are 
pretty bland. That's fine if you're trying to show heterosexuals that 
gays are really just plain folks. If you're trying to construct a drama, 
though, it really helps to have characters that are actually interesting. 
For better or worse, L!V!C! struggles mightily to be a gay version of THE 
BIG CHILL, but lacks the color and sense of motion necessary to pull it 
off. It sure has a lot of naked guys, though! What a shame to see so many 
penises wasted on a mediocre story.

In 1949, RKO Pictures released ''Mighty Joe Young,'' an unassuming 
adventure story about a young woman and her best friend, a 15-foot tall 
gorilla with the strength of 20 men and the heart of a child. The good-
natured film was notable for a wonderfully peculiar nightclub scene 
featuring a tug-of-war between Joe and a group of professional wrestlers, 
a stirring climax, and exceptional stop-motion animation. 49 years later, 
Disney's remake of the venerable fable hits the screen, with computer 
graphics and animatronics replacing the stop-motion animation. While too 
much of the 1998 ''Mighty Joe Young'' is merely sturdy rather than 
stirring, the film still manages to capture a measure of the original's 
charm.
The story begins in Tanzania, as Dr. Ruth Young (Linda Purl) and her 
daughter Jill (Mika Boorem) study a family of gorillas. Of special 
interest is young Joe, who is growing rapidly due to a genetic mutation. 
Unfortunately, a group of poachers, led by the evil Strasser (Rade 
Sherbedgia), is also interested in Joe, leading to an encounter that 
results in the deaths of Jill and Joe's mothers.
Twelve years later, Jill (Charlize Theron) and Joe live a secluded, 
idyllic life deep in the green forests of a distant mountain, until 
another group of outsiders disturb the peace. Scientist Gregg O'Hara 
(Bill Paxton) has only good intentions, but his discovery of Joe's 
enclave piques the interest of many, including Strasser. Convinced that 
Joe is no longer safe in their mountain hideaway, Jill reluctantly agrees 
to move the gorilla to Gregg's base of operations, a California wildlife 
preserve, where she will continue to care for Joe. Things go wrong, of 
course, because it's against cinematic law to make a giant gorilla movie 
without an extended sequence of the ape rampaging through crowded city 
streets.
''Mighty Joe Young'' works well during the jungle Shangri-La and running-
amok-in-L.A. scenes, but other parts of the film are far too subdued. The 
filmmakers reasoned that modern-day animal activists would never allow a 
giant gorilla to be carted off to do tricks in a nightclub, but their 
decision to move Joe to a New Age wildlife sanctuary was a big mistake, 
delivering about as much fun as a folk singer doing an opening set at a 
ska-punk concert. It would have been such a hoot watching Joe in a big, 
garish Las Vegas-style setting, getting down and dirty with a gaggle of 
painted-faced WWF goons experiencing 'roid rage. 
While the film's middle is soft and repetitious (Joe gets riled, Jill 
calms him down, Joe gets riled, Jill calms him down. Enough, already!), 
''Mighty Joe Young'' offers a number of rousing moments. The poachers' 
attack early in the story is unusually brutal and genuinely frightening, 
and the climax, which moves from the streets of Hollywood to the colorful 
amusement rides at Palisades Park, is well-staged and quite gripping. 
As far as the acting, no one in the cast is especially taxed by their 
roles. Sherbedgia is an effective villain, Paxton does his usual and 
Theron is appealing enough. The best actor in the cast is Joe himself, an 
emotionally expressive marvel of technical wizardry, designed and 
produced by the distinguished Rick Baker. So flawless is the blend of 
animatronics, costumes and computer graphics that after a few minutes, 
you stop thinking about the mechanical aspects and simply accept Joe as 
another actor, albeit a exceptionally large and hairy one.
Despite its lethargic scenes and formulaic storyline, ''Mighty Joe 
Young'' has enough magic to warrant a viewing. The relationship between 
Jill and the mighty ape is endearing and the film has an innocent, 
affable core that nicely counterbalances its grisly moments. If you enjoy 
the film, do yourself a favor and track down the original. It may lack 
state-of-the-art special effects, but Joe's tug-of-war with the wrestlers 
sure has pizzazz.

Some words of warning: "Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch. The film,
which chronicles the events leading up to the December 30, 1993 death of
21-year old Teena Brandon, features images of intense brutality,
including an almost unbearably realistic rape scene. Even in its quiet
moments, a sense of impending doom washes over the screen. This is
powerful moviemaking. Over two months have passed since the critics'
screening of the film, but it still remains vividly etched in my memory.
So why should you subject yourself to "Boys Don't Cry?" Because it will
transport you to a place you (hopefully) have never been before. After
experiencing this film, you'll have a better understanding of
homophobia, of misogyny, of unbridled hated. You'll have a better
understanding of compulsive, self-destructive behavior. After spending
two hours in Falls City, Nebraska, those shrieking yahoos on "The Jerry
Springer Show" won't seem so comical anymore.
"Boys Don't Cry" is based on a true story. As usual, the filmmakers
change some facts, including a couple of significant ones, but the core
of truth remains. On a regular basis, Teena Brandon strapped down her
breasts, stuffed a tube sock into her jeans and headed out to live and
love as a man named Brandon Teena.
Teena was a fairly convincing man. His gait, mannerisms and vocal
cadences were credible. Only when he feared his physical gender was
about to be revealed did his feminine traits betray the disguise. Make
no mistake, Teena was neither a gay activist nor a gay saint. A product
of a socio-economic underclass where ignorance is the norm, Teena acted
out of a drive he couldn't explain or contain. Following heartfelt
warnings from friends and numerous scrapes with locals and the law,
Teena simply moved his actions to a neighboring town.
There Teena (Hilary Swank) becomes friends with John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III), a pair of ex-cons
given to heavy partying and bursts of violence. He also meets, and falls
in love with, young Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny), remaining oblivious to
the fact that Lotter and Tisdel had once been involved, and that the
volatile Lotter still pines for his ex.
And so the pattern for disaster falls into place. As Teena and Tisdel
draw closer, the good old boys get more twitchy. Sitting in the theater
knowing what's coming, you want to climb into the screen, grab Teena and
shout, "Snap out of it! These people are dangerous! Pack your gear, move
to a college town and hit a gay bar, for Christ's sake!"
No such luck. Teena continues his dance with doom, just as so many
others do. While the individual story of Brandon Teena is particularly
nightmarish, especially in light of the increase in violent assaults
against gays, it is just one of many. Teena also represents every woman
who stays in an abusive relationship with a man; every aging gay male
who pretends his trophy boy loves him for his soul and not his money,
every person who remains in terrible circumstances because they see no
alternative.
There's more. Watch the men in this story. Their contempt of women is
overwhelming and all too common. When they learn of Teena's true
physical gender, the motivation behind their horrific reactions is
blurred. Is it because of the deception, because of the gay thing, or
because they have learned that their buddy is (shudder) a lowly female?
The visceral power of "Boys Don't Cry" comes from the skills of director
Kimberly Peirce and a slew of amazing performers. Hilary Swank, a Best
Actress Oscar nominee for her work here, is astounding as Teena. At no
point in the film does she ever hit a single false note. Chloe Sevigny,
a nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category, works magic, using
her languid eyes and tentative smile to great effect. And don't overlook
the guys  Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III are skilled enough to
humanize their characters, making their outbursts all the more chilling.
"Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch, but I hope you'll make the trip.
In addition to seeing a hell of a good movie, you'll get a tour of the
darker portions of our societal landscape, where monsters in baseball
caps cruise the streets, striking out blindly at anything they do not
understand.

If "The Haunting" was trimmed down to 40 minutes and presented in 3-D as 
an IMAX feature, it might serve as a passable diversion. In its present 
form, the production is merely a flat, draggy exercise in cheesy special 
effects and grandiose art direction palming itself off as a horror movie. 
"The Haunting" is not scary, not in the least. Although technically an 
adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel, "The Haunting of Hill House," the 
plot of the film is almost as insubstantial as the spirits within it. In 
fact, the whole thing plays far more like an amusement park spook-house 
ride than a real movie. The producers would be better served by cutting a 
deal with Disney World, installing a tram on the sets and billing the 
whole thing as "The Haunted Mansion: Version 2.0."
"The Haunting" is just another sad example of the "more-is-better" school 
of filmmaking, with Jan "Oh my God, it's the guy who directed 'Speed 2!'" 
De Bont at the helm. While wasting 112 precious, irreplaceable minutes of 
my life on this leaden dud, I repeatedly thought of "The Blair Witch 
Project," a genuinely creepy, disquieting film produced for less money 
than "The Haunting" spent on catered lunches for the crew. Didn't anyone 
at Dreamworks notice that their $80 million horror show wasn't the 
slightest bit horrifying? Apparently not, for while the studio did sent 
De Bont back for some last minute reshoots, it was only to "clarify the 
ending." 
The film starts off in standard haunted-house movie fashion, introducing 
the characters and giving viewers a tour of Spook Central. Liam Neeson 
plays a doctor who lures three subjects to a massive, gothic mansion in 
New England, under the pretense of conducting a study of sleep disorders. 
Actually, he is researching the "primordial fear reaction" and intends to 
plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens. The 
nitwits who believe that a sleep study would be conducted in a mammoth, 
isolated house are Eleanor (Lili Taylor), a mousy caregiver; Theodora 
(Catherine Zeta Jones), an extremely self-assured bisexual; and Luke 
(Owen Wilson), a wise-cracking slacker. 
But forget the characters (De Bont certainly did), for the real star is 
the house itself, an absurdly huge estate packed with gigantic creaking 
doors, cavernous hallways, wildly ornate chambers (including a mirrored 
carousel room), and loads of cherub carvings, gargoyles and other weird 
knickknacks. The sets are impressive, but never for a moment do they seem 
like anything but over-the-top eye candy. 
There lies the problem with the whole movie. Nothing feels the least bit 
convincing, from the idiotic premise to the phony-looking house to the 
cornball special effects (try, just try, not to laugh as the wooden 
cherubs' faces morph into "Oh no!" expressions worthy of "Mr. Bill"). 
Ghost stories work only if the audience is drawn into the tale, and De 
Bont has no clue how to accomplish that. Instead of vicariously 
experiencing terror in a haunted house, we remain bored spectators, 
watching talented actors swallowed by De Bont's blustery spook-tacular. 
"The Haunting" promises thrills and chills, but delivers only yawns. What 
a colossal drag.

"Don't worry. Nobody would ever believe you're capable of doing what 
you've done." So it goes in the strikingly effective thriller, "A Simple 
Plan," where even words of consolation come with a sting. For the 
production, writer Scott B. Smith reworked his hit novel into a focused, 
economic script, which director Sam Raimi has crafted into that rarest of 
creations, a movie that is better than the book. To best enjoy the film, 
I'd suggest you not read the rest of this piece until after you've 
returned from the theater. If you choose to continue, remember that 
you've been warned. 
"A Simple Plan" chronicles the results of a fateful decision made by 
three men on a winter day outside their small, Midwestern hometown. When 
Hank (Bill Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jacob's 
friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) come across a downed plane containing a dead 
body and a bag with over $4 million in cash, they huddle to discuss what 
they should do. 
Hank wants to turn everything over to the police. After all, he and his 
wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda) already have a wonderful life. Hank is a 
respected member of the community with a good job, and the couple has a 
baby on the way. Everything is fine just the way it is. But Jacob and Lou,
 both poor and miserable, have different ideas. After much arguing, they 
come up with a simple plan. Hank will hold the money until the plane is 
discovered by others and the subsequent investigation completed. Once 
they are sure that the authorities are finished, they'll split the bounty,
 leave town and move on to better lives elsewhere.
But, of course, matters rarely go as planned. All too soon, distrust and 
greed stir up unresolved issues from the men's pasts. The film has an 
amazing number of twists and turns, including several violent moments, 
but nothing ever feels contrived. This is storytelling at its most 
genuine, with detailed, believable characters and considerable acumen. 
"A Simple Plan" is set against a background of snow, effectively 
establishing a crisp, stark atmosphere that aides the film immeasurably. 
The ominous tone builds slowly and surely; even the periodic bursts of 
gallows humor serve to underscore the ever increasing sense of dread. 
Director Raimi handles Smith's words beautifully, aided by a superb cast 
who make every sentence crackle with authenticity. 
As the mistrust grows, relationships are examined and reexamined, and the 
effect is mesmerizing. Most thrillers are content to just follow the 
central plotline, but this film pokes and prods areas rarely examined. 
Jacob and Lou express their resentment over the way Hank talks to them, 
and we get an insightful glimpse into the middle American class system, 
where individuals with less education, little money or weak social skills 
are marginalized by the better schooled. 
Listen to the exchanges between brothers Hank and Jacob, forced into 
intimacy by circumstance, and you'll understand how easy it is to put 
human beings into neat, categorized little boxes; to use selective 
memories to create nostalgia for a glossy, comfortable past that never 
was. As an average man in way over his head, Bill Paxton gives the best 
performance of his career, and Billy Bob Thornton is nothing short of 
phenomenal as Jacob, a grimy outcast who is far more observant and 
intelligent that he appears to be. 
Watch Hank and Sarah, who start the film content with their storybook 
existence together, only to have their perception of the good life 
perverted by the lure of wealth. It's fascinating, and frightening, to 
witness their change in attitude. Bridget Fonda is a wonder to behold, 
transforming from a blissful mother-to-be into a woman who views all she 
once treasured as a trap, a purgatory of repetitious mediocrity from 
which escape is mandatory. 
"A Simple Plan" is a stunning psychological study of lives unraveling, of 
promises betrayed and hope turned to dust. Early in the film, a character 
refers to the cache of money as "the American dream... in a gym bag." 
Raimi and Smith's powerful "A Simple Plan" shows the consequences of 
pursuing a dream at the expense of your own humanity.

Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER (1997)
Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Claire Danes, Mary Kay Place
PG-13, 2 stars
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

All of the elements for a can't-miss film were there. A David vs. Goliath 
story about an idealistic young man battling corrupt lawyers and a 
soulless insurance company, directed by the legendary Francis Ford 
Coppola from his screenplay of John Grisham's best-selling novel. Yet, 
"The Rainmaker" is a major disappointment, a self-righteous exercise in 
audience manipulation that chokes on its own smugness. While the film 
retains some pleasures, Coppola's heavy-handed direction snuffs out the 
sense of exhilaration a story like this should have.   
The first hint of trouble comes from the official title, "John Grisham's 
The Rainmaker." The prolific Grisham has become a brand name, and 
whenever Hollywood slaps an author's name onto the title of a film, it's 
safe to expect the worst. Think of "Stephen King's Graveyard Shift," 
"Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough" or "Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline" 
and you'll get the idea. 
The story, while not exactly earth shaking, is durable enough. Recent 
Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon,) idealistic and 
eager to work, reluctantly hooks up with Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke,) a 
sleazeball lawyer who keeps a live shark in his office aquarium, lest we 
miss the other painfully obvious signs of his corruption. Stone pairs the 
kid with Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito,) an ambulance-chaser who has 
failed the bar six times, and sets the pair off to troll for business at 
a local hospital, where Baylor meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes,) a young 
woman whose husband batters her on a regular basis.
Refusing to adopt his employer's tactics, Baylor takes his own path, 
renting a room from Miss Birdie (Teresa Wright,) an elderly client 
looking to cut her money-grubbing kids out of her will, leaving her 
assets to a televangelist instead. "He needs the money," she explains, 
"Why, the upkeep on his jet alone costs a fortune." But Baylor's big case,
 and the centerpiece of the story, is a lawsuit against Great Benefit, an 
insurance company that specializes in shafting the poor. Donny Ray Black 
(Johnny Whitworth) is dying of leukemia and the company has flatly and 
repeatedly denied his claims, climaxing in a letter to his mother (Mary 
Kay Place) rejecting the claim for the "final time" and calling her 
"stupid, stupid, stupid." So the inexperienced young Baylor and his 
ramshackle assistant head for court, defending a dying boy and his poor 
family against a battery of high-priced lawyers, hatchet men for an evil 
corporation. Any idea how the case will turn out? 
Fine, so its a obvious story with easy targets. Lots of memorable films 
have came from trite ideas. "Hoosiers" also told a David vs. Goliath tale,
 filled with every cliché in the book, yet that film succeeds while "The 
Rainmaker" flounders. Why? Because inexplicably, Francis Ford Coppola 
undermines the very film he is directing. Coppola's work here is so ham-
handed that it smothers the emotional impact of the story. Scenes of the 
corporate lawyers, led by Jon Voight, are painful studies in overkill. 
Coppola doesn't allow the bad guys even a hint of humanity. Instead, 
every shot shows them scowling, smirking or exchanging smug glances. They 
are nothing less than walking cartoons; watching them get their 
comeuppance carries about as much dramatic weight as seeing Yosemite Sam 
shoot himself in the foot. 
Then there is Danny DeVito's Deck Schifflet character. "The Rainmaker" is 
designed to give viewers vicarious kicks by watching an idealistic young 
man bring down an arrogant corporation by taking on their unethical 
lawyers, yet Schifflet's equally corrupt behavior is played for laughs. 
Schifflet is a bottom-feeder, but presented as just a lovable little 
scamp. His antics disrupt the film's dramatic flow and become 
increasingly annoying as the story trudges along.
Thank goodness for "The Rainmaker's" strong cast. Matt Damon is fine in 
the lead role. He underplays the part nicely, investing Baylor with an 
appealing blend of awkwardness and strength of character. DeVito gives a 
hearty performance as well, despite how his character is misused. Claire 
Danes does what she can as the abuse victim, although the whole story 
involving her character is treated as a sketchy footnote to the film, 
rather than a major secondary story. Teresa Wright is appealing as the 
flighty, but feisty Miss Birdie, but the real scene-stealer here is Mary 
Kay Place, with a resonant performance as the mother of the dying young 
man. 
Despite the best efforts of the cast, "The Rainmaker" packs little impact.
 Beyond all the problems with Coppola's direction, the simple truth is 
that you can find more inventive, better told stories than this by 
flipping on the TV and watching "Homicide," "Law & Order" or "The 
Practice." You may not get John Grisham's brand name, but you'll save $7.
00.

To best enjoy "The Muse," you need to get into the proper state of mind. 
First, forget the blurbs from quote whores proclaiming the film 
"hilarious" and "a laugh riot." It isn't. "Amusing," "pleasant" and 
"generally enjoyable" would be more appropriate terms. Second, lower your 
expectations. Because comedian-writer-actor-director Albert Brooks ("Lost 
in America," "Defending Your Life," "Mother") is held in such high regard,
 people tend to forget that while even the slightest of his films 
contains moments of comic genius, there are always numerous dead spots as 
well, even in the best of his works. And "The Muse" is not Albert Brooks 
at his best.    
Directed and co-written by Brooks, this shaggy dog story is more low-key 
than his usual offerings, with many flat stretches. Still, there are 
rewards here, notably jabs at Hollywood mentality; well-placed cameos 
from Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Wolfgang Puck and others; Sharon 
Stone's fizzy performance in the title role; and, as always, the 
satisfaction of watching Brooks do wonderfully slow burns as his 
exasperation grows, building inevitably to deliciously juvenile outbursts.
This time around, Albert plays Steven Phillips, a screenwriter with 17 
scripts and an Oscar nomination to his credit. After receiving a 
humanitarian award at a gala dinner, with his wife Laura (Andie 
MacDowell) and young daughters watching in pride, he goes into the studio 
the next morning, only to have his world crash around him. A smarmy 
junior executive casually informs Steven that he has lost his edge. Not 
only is the studio rejecting his current script, it has decided to 
release him from his three-picture deal. 
In a panic, Steven races to the home of friend and fellow writer Jack 
Warrick (Jeff Bridges) for counsel. Moved by Steven's desperation, Jack 
confides the secret of his success. He is a client of Sarah (Sharon 
Stone), a genuine, daughter-of-Zeus Muse. Muses inspire creativity and 
Sarah is a hot commodity in the film community. After considerable 
badgering, Jack finally sets up a meeting between Steven and Sarah. In 
short order, Steven has his own Muse who lives up to her billing, but 
provides nonstop headaches along with inspiration. 
The concept is solid enough, but the execution falters. After a juicy 
opening, the story meanders and the aimless feel is enervating. The witty 
vignettes that pop up every few minutes are welcome, but they also 
underline the weakness of the main plotline. 
Part of the problem is Brooks himself. The comic actor always plays self-
absorbed, self-pitying types (his film persona is essentially the West 
Coast equivalent of Woody Allen, minus the creepiness), but his Steven 
Phillips appears haggard and speaks in pessimistic terms even when things 
are going well.
While Brooks' zeal seems muted, he still delivers a number of sharp one-
liners, particularly during his temper tantrums. Albert is a master at 
reacting to annoying characters, and he gets some world-class irritants 
here. He has some terrific exchanges with an oily Paramount exec (Mark 
Feuerstein) and a European partygoer (Mario Opinato) who twists the 
English language like a Bavarian pretzel.
There is a lot of old-fashioned shtick in "The Muse," as celebrities pop 
up for cameos tweaking their own images. "Titanic" director James Cameron 
has a cute bit and Martin Scorsese is a riot, babbling like a hyperactive 
loon about his insane concept for a "Raging Bull" remake. 
Comic vignettes aside, it's the women who keep the film going. Andie 
MacDowell gives one of her most likable performances to date as Laura 
Phillips, who starts realizing her own potential while spending time with 
the Muse. As Sarah the Muse, Sharon Stone proves quite adept at comedy, 
deftly creating a character who is at once demanding and ditzy. Stone is 
clearly having the time of her life playing such an off-beat type, and 
her enthusiasm is most appreciated.
If only the film had as much energy as Stone. It starts off strong and 
has a clever ending, but oh, does the midsection ever sag. Were I a Muse, 
I'd have strongly suggested that Brooks and his longtime writing partner 
Monica Johnson do another draft or two, because even the languidly paced 
"Mother" looks perky compared to this. 
After watching "The Muse," I'm reminded of the scene in which Steven is 
told that, while his script is serviceable, it lacks edge. That is 
exactly the trouble with this movie. "The Muse" is amusing, pleasant and 
generally enjoyable, which would be enough for most filmmakers, but from 
someone of Albert Brooks' caliber, we have a right to expect more.

"Waking the Dead," an overwrought, underdeveloped story of a young
politician (Billy Crudup) in the '80s having visions of his
presumed-dead, activist girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) from the '70s, is
one of the most annoying films I have endured in years. Rather than
waste valuable composition time following the standard review format,
I've decided to simply list some of the reasons why.
A) Time travel abuse: The movie leaps between the '70s and '80s so often
that I began to wonder if Dramamine works for temporal motion sickness.
Not since "Slaughterhouse Five" have characters been so unstuck in time.
But while the time jumping in "Slaughterhouse Five" was an integral part
of the story, it only serves to fracture "Waking the Dead," robbing the
film of any emotional cohesiveness.
B) Tired premise: It's love at first sight when fiercely dedicated
counterculture zealot Sarah Williams meets starchy Fielding Pierce, who
believes in working within the system. My, what an inventive concept.
Not since, oh any typical episode of "Dharma and Greg" has such a
radical dynamic been so thoughtfully explored.
C) Lame leads: She gives speeches and makes meaningful eye contact. He
gives speeches and whines. I get squirmy and check my watch.
D) Lack of chemistry: While both actors have shown promise in previous
cinematic outings, Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly's performances
here are painfully forced. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were
more convincing lovers than this pair.
E) The dialogue: "I don't know what I'm going to say, what I'm going to
do, from one minute to the next,' moans Fielding. "Sometimes meaningless
gestures are all we have," Sarah intones somberly. I'm amazed that one
of them didn't blurt out "Love means never having to say you're sorry."
F) Billy Crudup's feet: After spending considerable time padding
barefoot around Sarah's bohemian pad, Fielding lies down on the bed and
we see the pink, squeaky-clean bottoms of his feet. In the real world, a
brief walk across any hardwood floor would leave at least a bit of
visible dirt. Of course, had the story been even mildly involving, I
wouldn't have noticed.
G) Endless posing: Intimate scenes are undermined by director Keith
Gordon's insistence on artful placement of the character's bodies. Nude
shots of Crudup and Connelly have the actors' forms oh-so-carefully
positioned, covering their genitals while making them look less like
lovers and more like chintzy erotic sculptures.
H) The hippie brother and his psychedelic office: Paul Hipp overacts
shamelessly as Fielding's brother, a counterculture publisher. Even more
ridiculous is his tripped-out office, the least convincing hippie set
I've seen since Samantha's wacky cousin Serena went club hopping on
"Bewitched."
I) Stereotypes galore: While Paul Hipp is the most glaring of the
walking stereotypes, talented actors like Hal Holbrook, Janet McTeer and
Sandra Oh are also wasted playing animated clichés.
J) The "Is she or isn't she?" gimmick: A decade after the reported death
of his honey-bunny, Fielding begins catching glimpses of her everywhere.
Are these hallucinations brought on by guilt and longing or did Sarah
fake her death for some political purpose, only to resurface to seek out
her lost love? By the time the answer was revealed, I didn't give a
damn. Gordon's handling of the gimmick makes one appreciate the skilled
choreography of "The Sixth Sense" all the more.
K) Election night: Sure, "Waking the Dead" is a low budget film, but the
lack of bodies at Fielding's campaign headquarters on election night is
embarrassing. Surely the filmmakers could have bought a few cases of
beer and lured enough buddies over to fill up the room.
L) The "Second Stage at Lilith Fair" Soundtrack: The film is packed with
cut-rate crooning from sensitive young women with acoustic guitars.
Quick, grab a pellet gun!
M) Fading to white: Gordon repeatedly ends scenes by fading to white, an
effect that grows old quickly and serves only to amplify the fragmented
nature of the production.
N) Fake snow: There's a lot of snow in this movie and, while much of it
appears genuine, that stuff falling on the actors looks suspiciously
like Ore-Ida Instant Potato flakes. If you can't find the real thing, or
at least secure the use of a decent snowmaking machine, don't bother.
It would be easy to finish the alphabet, but you get the point. "Waking
the Dead" is excruciating. I had to attend  it's in my job description.
But you, oh lucky reader, you get to make a choice.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
I'm assuming that anyone who has read this far is familiar with the
series, so I'll keep the plot description to a minimum. Set mostly in
Hollywood, "Scream 3" continues the movie-within-a-movie conceit, as
production of "Stab 3" comes screeching to a halt when a killer, dressed
in the familiar ghost mask and black cowl, appears on the scene. In
short order, all of our old favorite characters, along with a host of
new ones, are scrambling to stay alive and unmask Ghost Face once and
for all.
The character dynamics have significantly changed along the way. Where
central target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) was once the focal point
of the action, she now plays second banana to Deputy Dewey Riley and
cutthroat TV tabloid reporter Gale Weathers, played by the recently
married David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette. Although "Scream 2"
ended with Dewey and Gale as honey-bunnies, this storyline has the
couple estranged again, thereby allowing the Tom and Roseanne of the
21st century to bicker a lot before their relationship heats up again.
While Dewey and Gale play junior detective on the "Stab 3" set, Sidney
is holed up far, far away in a high-security mountain cabin, counseling
abused women via a series of high-security phone lines. When she learns
of Ghost Face's Tinseltown Tour 2000, she leaves her sanctuary and
reluctantly heads for Los Angeles (incidentally, reluctantly is the only
way anyone should ever head for Los Angeles).
Fine. The veterans are in place, newcomers are running around all over
the set and the killer is slashing away. So what are we dealing with
here? Kevin Williamson, who became white hot thanks to his dandy script
for the original "Scream," was too busy to write the finale (he
reportedly was trying to salvage his wretched TV series, the aptly named
"Wasteland"), leaving flavor-of-the-month Ehren Kruger ("Arlington
Road," "Reindeer Games") to fill in, with mixed results.
One of the high points is his pairing of Gale Weathers with Jennifer
Jolie (Parker Posey), the actress playing Gale in "Stab 3." The
combination of a hyperactive, manipulative reporter and a ditzy starlet
determined to copy her every move is inspired, and Posey is a riot. The
only thing that hampers their scenes is the alarming physical appearance
of Courteney Cox Arquette. With her increasingly gaunt features (please,
somebody feed this woman!) and godawful Cleopatra-with-hacked-bangs
hairdo, she looks scarier than Ghost Face.
While going lighter on the pop culture references than Williamson,
Kruger does get in some good ones. In addition to the pointed
one-liners, check the closing credits for the character names of the
"Stab 3" players, which can be taken as a nod, or a swipe, at a gaggle
of popular young actors.
Director Wes Craven has some fine moments as well. His composition work
is exceptional, particularly in a haunting shot where Sidney emerges
from a studio hallway and the camera slowly pulls away as she finds
herself on a movie set recreating a street scene straight out of her
personal nightmares. Throughout the film, Craven uses lights and darks
masterfully, and his positioning of music to heighten tension is far
more effective than in most films of the genre.
Had he only paid as much attention to the script. In climatic scenes,
Sidney, Dewey and Gale abandon the very survival rules their characters
supposedly learned in the first two films. Even more damaging to "Scream
3" is the simple passage of time. Since the series burst on the scene in
1996, other artists have upped the humor-meets-horror ante. On any given
week, shows like the outstanding "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" mix chills
and giggles as adroitly as anything in "Scream," while creating
characters with considerably more substance. Regardless, though "Scream
3" represents a franchise running on fumes, there's still enough gas in
this old buggy for a moderately entertaining final ride.

At the press junket for "Charlie's Angels," director McG (pronounced
McGee), a music video and commercial veteran, explained his approach
towards his feature film debut. "We wanted to make a big, colorful,
exciting, larger-than-life sort of film that feels like you shook up a
bottle of champagne and just splashed it over a bunch of celluloid," he
said. "The goal was to take the comedy and turn it to 11, take the
action and turn it to 11, take the sexiness and turn it to 11 and just
max out this film'"
McG achieved his goal. The big screen adaptation of the hit TV action
series from the '70s certainly reflects the unbridled enthusiasm of his
mission statement. From beginning to end, it cheerfully assaults the
viewer with every imaginable cinematic gimmick, punctuated by snippets
of no less than 39 pop songs. "Charlie's Angels" isn't just a
high-octane version of the original. It's also a 98-minute music video,
a slapstick comedy, a special effects showcase, a stunt spectacular, a
James Bond knock-off, a chop-socky fight movie and a paean to the '60s
"Batman" TV show's camp sensibilities.
In short, the film is a mess. More often than not, it's a surprisingly
fun mess, however, even though McG's inexperience with long-form
productions becomes more and more obvious as the story barrels forward
with all the finesse of a dozen Superballs ricocheting in a small
closet. I left "Charlie's Angels" entertained, but exhausted.
The plot, such as it is, goes as follows. Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan
(Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are the latest batch of ex-cops
working for the Townsend Detective Agency, where they receive their
assignments by phone from the always-unseen Charlie (voiced by John
Forsythe, the only returning member of the original cast). Aided by
their faithful right-hand man, Bosley (Bill Murray), the Angels set out
to retrieve kidnapped software genius Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) and keep
his cutting-edge voice-recognition technology from falling into evil
hands. Along the way, they must deal with imperious a top-level Knox
exec Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), corporate competitor Roger Corwin (Tim
Curry, as smarmy as ever) and the Thin Man (Crispin Glover), an
extremely dangerous goon with a hair fetish.
Of course, the storyline is just a contrivance to allow the women to do
battle with bad guys while wearing various exotic costumes (two of the
Angels dress up in drag and, as a man, Drew Barrymore is a dead ringer
for James Spader). Incidentally, even though their enemies are heavily
armed, the Angels do not carry guns, proving definitively that Charlie's
last name is not Heston.
The film starts off with a bang-up James Bond style set piece, as the
camera seamlessly glides through the clouds into a passing luxury
airliner, where LL Cool J is dealing with a nut case. Abruptly, LL opens
the emergency exit, throws the man out and leaps after him, leading into
a skydiving sequence. The pair ends up in a speedboat, where we finally
meet the Angels.
As with the TV series, each Angel, while smart as a whip and
multitalented, can be summed up in one word. Drew Barrymore (who
co-produces the film) is the sexy one, Cameron Diaz is the giddy one and
Lucy Liu is the devilish one. The three actors are clearly having a
wonderful time with their roles and each is afforded showcase moments.
Liu gets to play dominatrix in an efficiency expert scene, Diaz shakes
her small, but shapely booty to the tune of "Baby Got Back" in a comic
bit on the set of "Soul Train," and Barrymore plays seductress with a
limo driver in a revealing scene that makes it clear why David Letterman
smiled so widely when she danced on his desk and flashed him.
A lot of "Charlie's Angels" works. The camaraderie between the women is
winning, some of the stunts are spectacular and a fair percent of the
jokes are actually funny (check out the slow-motion-hair-flipping
instructions during a party scene). I particularly enjoyed the frequent
use of rear screen projection, a clever nod to the cut rate filming
techniques employed by the original series.
What doesn't work is most of Bill Murray's shtick, the
less-than-graceful "Matrix" style wire work during the martial arts
segments, McG's uneven, needlessly rapid editing style and his
insistence on framing every shot as if it was the highlight of a music
video. Flinging everything but the kitchen sink at the viewer may work
in a three-minute MTV clip, but stretched over the length of a film, it
grows old fast. Even in an amusing trifle like "Charlie's Angels,"
things like consistency of tone still matter. Next time, McG, try
turning it down to 9 every once in a while.

Let's get the basics out of the way. "The Prince of Egypt" is a well-
acted, great-looking movie. While the animators' attempts to fully 
integrate computer-generated images with traditional drawings are not 
always successful, the story of Moses is still visually sumptuous, aided 
immeasurably by impressive cinematography worthy of a live-action film. 
The sunbaked desert vistas are quite handsome and a few scenes, notably 
the parting of the Red Sea and a raucous chariot race, are dazzling. That 
said, "The Prince of Egypt" is not quite the awe-inspiring epic it wants 
to be.
The film opens with a disclaimer informing viewers that what they are 
about to see is true to the "essence and values" of its Biblical source. 
While preparing the lavish DreamWorks feature, hundreds of religious 
leaders were consulted to avoid stepping on anyone's toes. At the same 
time, the producers tried to avoid excessively pious displays that might 
alienate mainstream audiences. The result is a movie too careful for its 
own good. The filmmakers strive for dramatic grandeur while walking on 
eggshells, and their caution shows up onscreen. 
Put simply, "The Prince of Egypt" doesn't know what to do with God. In 
contemporary Western culture, most people try to lead spiritual lives, 
but are vague about religious specifics. We view God in fuzzy terms at 
best, as some benign omnipotent parent, the personification of love. 
Aside from a noisy fundamentalist minority, most people tend to embrace 
the gentle "do unto others" philosophy of the New Testament over the fire 
and brimstone violence of the Old Testament. 
All of this left DreamWorks with a dilemma; how to stay relatively true 
to the Moses saga from the Book of Exodus without putting off audiences 
uncomfortable with a wrathful God given to extremely vicious outbursts 
towards those who offend him. Their solution was to put the emphasis 
firmly on the human elements of the story. While the relationship between 
Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses is involving, and the Hebrews' 
quest for freedom stirring, the sheer majesty of a people moving closer 
to the Almighty is muted by the film's cautious approach. During most of 
the story, God plays like a special effect instead of a deity. 
The burning bush scene is surprisingly tepid, feeling more like a 
conversation between Luke Skywalker and Yoda than one between Moses and 
God. In one confrontation between the brothers, Moses' walking stick 
turns into a snake and, instead of being awestruck, his brother simply 
has his minions call on their deities to do some stunts of their own. The 
exhibition of dueling magic tricks is too ordinary, just a bit of 
"Fantasia" sorcery with Biblical trappings. Overall, the story comes off 
like a lush animated historical tale of people escaping slavery, 
augmented by nifty special effects, rather than a supernatural encounter 
with an all-powerful presence. Come to think of it, the climax of 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" had more of a "Holy Cow, we're actually 
witnessing the power of God!" feel than most of this movie. 
The extended sequence displaying the parting of the Red Sea is the one 
section of the film that fully realizes its potential as an old-fashioned 
religious spectacular. The great upwards rush of water, an image of a 
whale swimming near the Hebrews and the physical detailing of the ocean 
floor combine for a scene that genuinely looks like a miracle. 
If only the rest of the film worked as well. Even the story's other 
visual high point, an exhilarating chariot race, suffers from the awkward 
inclusion of a computer-generated nose falling from a huge statue that 
looks like it was superimposed over the rest of the scene. Throughout the 
feature, contrasting styles of drawing tend to clash. While the humans 
are have a nicely stylized, semi-realistic appearance, many of the 
animals are drawn in the classic Disney fashion. Thankfully, none of them 
talk, although they look as if they could. 
For the most part, the film's show-tunes are dull and intrusive. The 
orchestral score incorporates some musical elements indigenous to the 
setting, but the bulk of the music is standard fare. As for the acting, 
an all-star cast delivers uniformly good performances, lending 
credibility to the often-stilted dialogue. Stand-outs include Val Kilmer 
as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses and Patrick Stewart, using his 
magnificent voice to give appropriate thunder to the imperious Pharaoh.
DreamWorks is promoting "The Prince of Egypt" as a landmark in animation 
and a transcendent experience. I would caution you to lower your 
expectations. The acting, cinematography, and most of the animation more 
than make up for the cheesy songs and occasionally anachronistic dialogue.
 Had the filmmakers made fewer concessions to contemporary sensibilities, 
this could have been a real barn-burner. But they forgot the crucial fact 
that to create a religious epic, God has to make more than a cameo 
appearance.

During the whopping two hour and 44 minute running time of "The Patriot," my
mood shifted repeatedly. Early on, I found the oh-so-perfect picture
postcard lighting of every single damn scene so maddening that I leaned to a
friend and growled, "I hate this movie!" Then a juicy battle scene
reinvigorated my fading spirits. Later, I even got a little misty during a
quiet father/son moment. But just as I was ready to surrender to the story's
rah-rah momentum, the filmmakers threw in a series of
hero-charging-forward-waving-the-flag-in-slow-motion images so cheesy that I
wanted to scream, "Run for your lives, they've remade 'The Postman!'"
What else should I have expected from a Revolutionary War epic presented by
the producer and director team responsible for "Stargate," "Independence
Day" and "Godzilla?" Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are infamous for their
ability to take intriguing premises and turn them into overcooked,
cliché-filled, pop culture goulash. Many people find their concoctions
satisfying, but as for me, pass the Pepto Bismo, please.
To be fair, "The Patriot" is one of their better offerings. The screenplay,
by "Saving Private Ryan" author Robert Rodat, explores the horrifying
concept of having a war fought in your own backyard, while effectively
presenting the differences between the Brits' formal, "gentlemanly" approach
to combat and the American militia's guerrilla tactics.
But Devlin and Emmerich's treatment of the script is remarkably ham-handed.
John William's thunderous score assaults the viewer, as Mel Gibson turns
from a war-wary father into a colonial Rambo. This film isn't about
patriotism, it's about revenge. The ads should read "Gibson's back, and this
time it's personal! Welcome to 'Death Wish 1776.'"
Mel plays Benjamin Martin, a South Carolina widower determined to stay out
of the uprising against the British and raise his seven children in peace. A
veteran of the French and Indian War, he is haunted by memories of
atrocities committed during battle. But his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath
Ledger), views the hesitancy of his father with disdain and defiantly joins
the rebels.
Months later, the fighting draws near and Gabriel returns home injured.
While caring for him, and other wounded soldiers from both sides, Benjamin
is visited by British troops, led by the sadistic Colonel William Tavington
(Jason Isaacs). In short order, Tavington has his men burn down the Martin
home, arrests Gabriel and orders his execution and then shoots Martin's
second eldest boy. As soon as Tavington leaves, Benjamin arms his children,
rescues Gabriel and becomes leader of the area militia. His reputation as
"The Ghost" grows to the point that British General Cornwallis (Tom
Wilkinson) sends out his troops to capture Benjamin Martin, by any means
necessary.
At times, "The Patriot" delivers on its promises. Subdued conversations
between Benjamin and Gabriel are moving, thanks to the skills of Mel Gibson
and Heath Ledger, a handsome Aussie with talent and charisma reminiscent of
Gibson in his youth. A visit to a black refuge by the sea provides a welcome
respite from the fighting. Best of all is a clever, well-staged
prisoner-exchange negotiation between Martin and Cornwallis.
While a couple of the extremely graphic battle scenes are gripping, most
lack focus, playing out as mere excuses for Director Emmerich to fill the
screen with as much blood and gore as possible (he seems particularly fond
of showing the effect of cannonballs on human extremities).
Many civilian moments are as cloying as the battles are grisly. Every scene
is filled with gorgeous skies, sunbeams streaming through the trees and
other storybook imagery that blunts the sense of realism. Young Anne Howard
(Lisa Brenner) comes off more like a contemporary woman than a colonial lass
as she challenges the men-folk to enter the fray. While delivering her
speech, she exchanges so many coy smiles with Gabriel that her words seem
less like a call-to-arms and more like foreplay.
The single most infuriating scene comes straight out of a teen slasher
flick. A good guy shoots a bad guy, who falls to the earth face down. Our
hero silently approaches and leans over the body when - surprise! - the
villain, apparently possessed of considerable psychic ability, springs
around at precisely the right moment to strike a fatal blow. Who knew that
the great-great-great grandfather of Jason from "Friday the 13th" was
British?
"The Patriot" has its moments, to be sure, and I fully expect it to be one
of the biggest hits of this anemic summer movie season. But the next time
Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich decide to crank out another of their
manipulative popcorn epics, I hope they'll stick to aliens and giant lizards
and leave our history alone.

Had "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" came out in the '70s, right after David
Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust," it likely would now be regarded as one of the
most popular rock musicals of all time. Released in the 500 channel,
sensory overload world of 2001, however, the big screen adaptation of
the acclaimed off-Broadway musical must do battle with countless other
productions clamoring for attention.
I almost missed it. Every August, the major studios try to squeeze the
last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their
shakier offerings on the marketplace at once. I was so busy trying to
keep up with national releases like "Summer Catch" and "Bubble Boy" that
I passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a
short local run. But an e-mail from a reader asking why I hadn't
reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the
theater.
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch" is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular
packed with great songs. Stylistically, the hook-laden tunes are
reminiscent of Bowie, "Bat Out of Hell" era Meatloaf and "The Rocky
Horror Show," without ever seeming like imitations. As with "Tommy,"
"Hedwig" tells a story of isolation, pain and defiance, but without the
bloated feel of that beloved, but overrated rock opera.
Writer-director-star John Cameron Mitchell and composer-lyricist Stephen
Trask have cooked up a real winner.
Mitchell stars as Hedwig, a singer from East Berlin touring a chain of
U.S. coffee shops with her pan-Slavic band, the Angry Inch. While the
patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock, and sometimes
horror, Hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song.
She was once a boy named Hansel (Ben Mayer-Goodman), living with his
mother (Alberta Watson) and listening to rock and roll on American Armed
Forces Radio. Life is an exercise in duality for Hansel. A wall splits
his hometown into two parts. Mother describes love as the emotion that
comes when you find your other half.
As Hansel grows up, the duality becomes more pronounced. After initially
mistaking him for a girl, a GI from the States (Maurice Dean Wint) falls
in love with Hansel and wants to marry him. Alas, Hansel will never pass
the mandatory physical. Mother helpfully suggests a sex change, but the
operation goes bad, hence the references to "the angry inch" (yes, I
know this part is squirm-inducing, but stick with me - it's worth it).
Several years later, Mr. Right is long gone and Hansel becomes Hedwig,
decked out in a Farrah Fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of
Korean women. Hedwig finds a new love in Tommy (Michael Pitt), a
beatific lad with a unique take on Christianity. But Tommy does Hedwig
wrong, stealing her songs and becoming a superstar.
Cut to the present. Tommy Gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and Hedwig is
suing him. Despite warnings from her manager (Andrea Martin) that she
could easily be labeled a stalker, Hegwig and her new band, the Angry
Inch, continue their coffee shop tour, shadowing the thief by playing
whatever city he is in.
If this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical, take a few
seconds and consider the plotlines of "Tommy" and "Rocky Horror."
As Hedwig, John Cameron Mitchell does a magnificent job taking a
character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and
turning her into a compelling human being. Mitchell has world-class
style and vocal chords to match. Even though the backstory is unusually
strong, Mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost
a rock musical. Everything is propelled by one terrific song after
another and, trust me, these are full-fledged rock songs, not the
over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals.
While Mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film,
there is much of interest on the sidelines. Miriam Shor does fine work
as Yitzhak, Hedwig's lover and bandmate, conveying a great deal through
expressions alone. Decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly
convincing beard, she makes a mighty attractive man. As always, "SCTV"
veteran Andrea Martin is a welcome presence onscreen and Michael Pitt is
beguiling as Tommy, the angelic-appearing little rat. Artist Emily
Hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that
charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical.
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch" surrounds a weird, funny and touching story
with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast. True
originals do not come along very often  don't let this slip out of town
without seeing it.

Review for Bent (1997)
Bent (1997)
Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Brian Webber, Mick Jagger, Ian McKellen. 
Directed by Sean Mathias. 104 minutes.
NC-17, 2.5 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

In 1979, Martin Sherman's "Bent" broke new ground. His play boldly 
addressed Nazi persecution of homosexuals during World War II, with a 
strong subtext about gay pride. At a pivotal moment, a character comes to 
terms with his homosexuality, saying "What's wrong with it?" That 
statement may have shocked audience members in those days, but that was 
then and this is now. Nearly twenty years later, "Bent" has finally hit 
the big screen and the film, while certainly admirable, feels more than a 
little dated. Through "Schindler's List" and many other fine works, the 
nightmares of the Holocaust are well documented. The goal of the 
survivors has been realized: we will never forget. The battle for 
societal acceptance and equal civil rights for gays continues, but few 
will argue that tremendous progress has been made. As for the fundamental 
message of gay pride, one has only to flip on a television to see dozens 
of positive gay role models on popular shows. 
So where does this leave "Bent?" In an awkward position, to say the least.
 The people who still need to be exposed to the film's message generally 
don't attend gay-themed movies, while many of those sympathetic to the 
concept will likely think "been there, done that," and opt not to attend.
It's a shame, really, because there are some good moments in "Bent." The 
film begins at a gay cabaret, as young men cavort under the watchful eye 
of the club's owner, Greta, a haggard drag queen played by Mick Jagger. 
The sight of Jagger in women's clothing is startling. Remember the 
episode of the Andy Griffith Show when Barney Fife went undercover 
dressed as a woman? That's exactly what Jagger looks like here.
But I digress. At the club, Max (Clive Owen) picks up the wrong man, a 
Nazi Stormtrooper, at the wrong time, the Night of the Long Knives, which 
marked the beginning of the Nazi's antigay campaign. After a night of sex,
 Max wakes to the sight his irate lover Rudy (Brian Webber) staring at 
the drunken soldier in Max's bed. Their quarrel is interrupted when Nazis 
burst into the room to execute the soldier. Max and Rudy barely escape 
and find scant help. Greta offers a little cash and Max's uncle (Ian 
McKellen, who played Max in the original London production of the play) 
does what little he can. Eventually, the two are arrested and thrown on a 
train to Dachau. Rudy quickly falls victim to the Nazis, but Max, who 
prides himself on being a shrewd deal-maker, survives by "proving" to the 
soldiers he's not gay by having sex with the corpse of a Jewish girl (off-
screen, thankfully.) He is rewarded with an upgrade to a yellow star (the 
designation for Jews) rather than a pink triangle (the gay symbol) for 
his prison uniform. 
While traveling to the prison camp, Max meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau,) a 
gay prisoner who detests Max for denying who he is. The two end up 
assigned to the same task: moving rocks from one pile to another, then 
back again. The chore is designed to drive the men to madness, but as 
they labor, they gradually grow closer. 
The men are afforded a short break every two hours. During this time they 
must stand at attention side by side, forbidden to touch, or even look at 
one another. The centerpiece of the film comes during one of those breaks,
 when the men talk each other to orgasm.
At its core, "Bent" is a love story set against a nightmare. Owen does a 
fine job portraying Max's growth from a callow, self-centered hedonist to 
a man who puts love ahead of his own safety. Bluteau is effective as 
Horst, whose pride and defiance balance his sanctimonious outbursts, and 
Webber convinces as the fragile Rudy.
Director Sean Mathias tries to open up the play for film, with mixed 
results. The early scenes at the cabaret are excessive, but credible 
enough and the young men's flight from the Nazis is believable, but once 
the story moves to Dachau, things change. Max and Horst are always shown 
isolated from the other prisoners, in settings that look overly 
theatrical. Too often, the characters fall into that clipped, rapid 
exchange of dialogue that one only hears during plays. And the ending, 
while certainly true to the original, comes off like the overwrought 
climax of a high school drama production.
As a play, "Bent" was a landmark. As a movie, it's an anachronism. The 
years have not been kind to Sherman's work. The lessons of his story 
remain vital, but over the ensuing years we've seen them presented in 
better forms. All good intentions aside, "Bent" is a classic example of 
too little, too late.

Traditionally, the last few weeks of summer trigger the release of an 
avalanche of weak films from the major studios, as the powers that be 
desperately try to squeeze whatever money they can from moviegoers still 
hungry for air-conditioned diversion. While most of these leftovers lack 
ideas or a distinctive point of view, "Why Do Fools Fall In Love" suffers 
from the opposite problem. Presenting the biography of singer Frankie 
Lymon, writer Tina Andrews and director Gregory Nava juggle too many 
ideas and points of view, resulting in a film that, while sporadically 
entertaining, mostly serves as a frustrating example of disjointed 
storytelling and missed opportunities.
The film prominently features a court battle between three women over the 
estate of Lymon, their late husband. Beneath that elaborate framing 
device lies your basic rags-to-riches-to-disaster pop music tale. Frankie 
Lymon and the Teenagers hit the big-time in the late '50s with the film's 
title song, a catchy doo-wop number which remains a staple of oldies 
stations. Lymon became a star and went solo, falling into a life of 
womanizing and drugs, leading towards the inevitable downfall. 
We've seen variations of this story before (in "The Buddy Holly Story," 
"La Bamba" and "The Doors," to name just a few), but Lymon's situation 
contains relatively fresh thematic potential. The phenomenon of rock and 
roll was manufactured by white businessmen by stealing rhythm and blues 
from the people who created it. For years, they made stars of white 
singers covering songs originally written and performed by black artists. 
When black performers were finally allowed to take their place in the 
mainstream spotlight, it was only under the rigid control of white 
management. 
Lymon was one of many artists marginalized due to race. Having achieved 
fame against the odds, he then found his star fading as the '60s British 
Invasion hit, making all other forms of music passé. Once again, young 
white kids ruled the charts with sounds derived from black musicians. 
"Why Do Fools Fall In Love" becomes quite interesting when examining this 
theme. Indeed, one of the film's most poignant scenes comes on the stage 
of the pop music show "Hullabaloo," as Lymon stands in the wings, staring 
in astonishment as The Kinks perform before a screaming crowd, while he 
waits to appear as an "oldies" act.
Lymon's attempts to maintain a career in an entertainment world where 
race and rapidly changing musical tastes work against him makes 
compelling viewing, but the production only devotes a few minutes to that.
 Director Nava is so busy navigating through the film's convoluted 
structure that he fails to deal with the issues raised by the story. The 
women's court battle should have been a mere framing device, but instead 
it takes over the film. In the height of irony, Frankie Lymon becomes a 
marginal figure in his own biography. 
Over the course of its 117 minutes, "Why Do Fools Fall In Love" tries to 
be several different movies. It's a man-bashing, female bonding flick as 
the three ex-wives discuss Lymon's flaws. It's a glossy bio-pic using 
spinning newspapers to flash headlines as it shows Lymon's meteoric climb 
to stardom in a dreamy retro-world. It's a melodramatic soap opera, 
showing the singer's abusive behavior as drugs swallow his being. It's a 
sassy courtroom comedy, with judge Pamela Reed allowing ex-wives Halle 
Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon to act more like guests on "The 
Jerry Springer Show" than plaintiffs in a court case.
Mostly, it's a superficial mish-mash of styles and tones that frequently 
entertains, but never fully satisfies. The songs are good and Larenz Tate 
gives an energetic performance as Lymon. There are a number of effective 
scenes, and it's a treat watching Little Richard play himself on the 
witness stand in a memorable cameo, testifying in both the legal and 
evangelical sense of the word. What a shame that age prevented him from 
playing himself throughout the film, because the actor portraying Little 
Richard as a young man is terrible (an actor imitating Redd Foxx and 
stand-ins for The Kinks are even less convincing).
Structural problems and bad impressionists aside, the fatal flaw is in 
the framing story itself. By focusing on the ex-wives instead of Lymon, 
viewers are asked to become emotionally involved with three characters 
squabbling over a dead man's money. As the film progresses and the women 
turn increasingly mercenary, sympathizing with their plight becomes 
extremely difficult. It's like being led outside to see a horse, then 
being presented with its carcass and urged to cheer for the vultures 
circling overhead.
At the end of the film, a picture of the real Frankie Lymon appears 
onscreen and I was struck by two things. First, he looked much younger 
than the actor who played him and second, after watching a film 
purportedly devoted to his memory, Frankie Lymon remained a stranger, 
just another rock and roll casualty, even in his own movie.

The romantic comedy, "Keeping the Faith," marks the directoral debut of
Edward Norton and, as a director, Norton remains one hell of a terrific
actor. Not that this is a bad film. "Keeping the Faith" boasts three
appealing leads along with a host of charming supporting players. Many
scenes are quite effective and the New York City production is
refreshingly sunny.
But the movie is simply too much. Situations are resolved too easily.
The opening segment, featuring slapstick that does not fit the
characters, is too cutesy. The story is too talky and, at two hours and
seven minutes, it's too long for a romantic comedy. If the infinitely
more complex classic, "The Philadelphia Story," was able to tie its
storylines together in 112 minutes, surely Norton could have wrapped
this baby up in an hour and a half.
But first time directors are notorious for throwing in everything but
the kitchen sink. And when the first time director is working from a
script written by an old college buddy (Yale alum and former investment
banker Stuart Blumberg), the prospect of trimming the screenplay must be
especially hard.
Blumberg's story is a twist on the tried and true romantic triangle, not
to mention the beginning of countless old jokes that start with "A
priest and a rabbi" Brian (Norton), Jake (Ben Stiller) and Anna (Jenna
Elfman) were childhood friends until Anna moved away, leaving her pals
broken-hearted. Years later, when the adult Anna returns to NYC,
circumstances have changed dramatically. Brian is an idealistic priest,
Jake a scrappy rabbi and Anna a high-powered executive with a cell phone
growing out of her hand.
Then Jake falls for Anna, Anna falls for Jake and the two secretly begin
dating, while Brian quietly falls for Anna and spends a lot more time
than usual praying and keeping his hands out of his pockets. Soon, the
friendship between the men begins to fray, as Jake slacks off on his
work for the interfaith community center that has long been their dream
project. Of course, Brian eventually learns the reason why and you can
take it from there.
The premise is sturdy enough, but the principal characters talk it to
death. For that matter, the supporting cast does a great deal of
yammering as well. And then there are the subplots and grafted on
slapstick (a rabbi who faints at a bris? Give me a break).
For the most part, Edward Norton's direction is solid, with one notable
exception. About two thirds of the way through, there is an extended
scene of Brian and Jake chatting outdoors. In each shot where the camera
is positioned behind Brian's head facing Jake, Brian's lines are
obviously dubbed in. When Jake finishes talking, we hear Brian, but his
jaw either doesn't move, or moves out of synch with his lines. Come on,
Norton, this is a romantic comedy, not a Godzilla movie.
As far as date movies go, "Keeping the Faith" is smarter and more
genuine than most. But with a tighter script and less shtick, it could
have been much, much better.

One of the best moments of the '98-'99 season of "The Simpsons" came when 
young Lisa visited the video section of a superstore and paused in front 
of a TV set showing the DVD version of "The Postman." The commentary 
track for the epic dud featured star and director Kevin Costner 
apologizing to viewers for the film. Upon closer examination, Lisa 
discovered it wasn't really a commentary track at all; Costner himself 
was standing behind the television set, personally telling each passerby 
how very, very sorry he was for foisting such a disaster on the public.   
Hopefully, "Waterworld" and "The Postman" have taught Kevin Costner that 
he is far better playing likable, flawed regular guys in down-to-earth 
settings than disaffected loners in post-apocalyptic societies. But then 
again, isn't that true for most of us?  
In "For Love of the Game," Costner revisits the world of baseball which 
has served his career so well. "Bull Durham" explored the nuts and bolts 
of life on the minor league circuit, while focusing on a raucous romantic 
triangle between Costner, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. "Field of 
Dreams" waxed poetic on the majesty and mystical beauty of the sport, 
taking a moving look at the nature of regret along the way. While not 
nearly as strong as either film, "For Love of the Game" is still one of 
Costner's best recent efforts.    
The production opens with a nice title montage of photos and home movies 
depicting young Billy Chapel (Costner) learning the rudiments of the game 
from his dad, playing Little League ball and eventually becoming a 
superstar pitcher with the Detroit Tigers (the images are from Costner's 
own childhood and the older couple seen in the stands later in the film 
are his real-life parents). 
We join the adult Chapel in the autumn of his career, on a particularly 
momentous day. The aging vet has just learned that his team is about to 
be sold and part of the deal includes his being traded to San Francisco. 
As if that wasn't enough, Billy's girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is 
leaving him. "You don't need me," she says, hours before her scheduled 
departure for London. "You and the ball and the diamond - - you're 
perfect." Dejected and hung over, Chapel heads for the ballpark to pitch 
what might very well be the last game of his career. While memories of 
his rocky five-year relationship with Jane flash through his head, Billy 
focuses totally on throwing as hard and true as possible, blanking out 
everything from the jeering Yankee fans to the scoreboard itself. 
And so goes the 137 minute feature, jumping from the game to numerous 
flashbacks of Billy and Jane. Director and baseball enthusiast Sam Raimi 
("A Simple Plan") is at his best during the game sequences. He presents 
major-league play from a first-person perspective with great 
verisimilitude, with Chapel verbally sizing up each opponent before 
firing fast balls and curves through the air like bullets. The images are 
searing and, even though the outcome of the game is easy to anticipate, 
Raimi establishes and maintains a sense of tension that is totally 
engrossing. 
The only problem with the game segments comes from the inclusion of 
overly obvious remarks from play-by-play announcers Vin Scully and Steve 
Lyons like "He's not just pitching a game. He's pitching against time. 
He's pitching against age." Thanks, fellas. We would never have figured 
that out on our own.
The many romantic flashbacks are less dynamic, but achieve their goal of 
depicting a couple who have trouble with trust and commitment. Baseball 
is everything for Billy and, though he cares deeply for Jane, he cannot 
take his eyes off the ball long enough to give their relationship the 
attention it requires. As for Jane, after building a successful career 
and raising a daughter on her own, she is wary of becoming the "other 
woman" in Billy's love affair with the game. Costner and Preston are 
effective in their roles, but because the two characters are so tentative 
in the area of romance, their interactions lack electricity. Both actors 
display more chemistry with Jane's teenage daughter Heather, nicely 
played by Jena Malone. 
Even though the less-than-sizzling romance hits most of the clichés of 
the genre (including two scenes that appear simply as excuses for MTV pop 
song moments), Costner and Preston succeed in rising above the sometimes-
tired dialogue. John C. Reilly also provides strong support as Chapel's 
catcher and best friend (At one point, Billy teases his overprotective 
pal by referring to him as "the ugliest wife in the league").
Though uneven and occasionally sluggish, "For Love of the Game" is a 
surprisingly satisfying hybrid of an old-fashioned sports film and a 
contemporary date movie. It's nice to see a story with the message that, 
regardless of age, we all still have the capacity for greatness and 
growth. While the film is the least of Kevin Costner's baseball trilogy, 
he has nothing to apologize for this time around.

In 1996, while working on a story about the film "Going All The Way," I 
served as an extra for a couple of days, affording me the opportunity to 
chat with the cast on a relaxed basis. During one conversation with 
Jeremy Davies, he noted that while we had talked several times, I had yet 
to speak with co-star Ben Affleck. "You really should connect with Ben," 
said the amiable, self-effacing actor, "he's got a lot going on. He co-
wrote a movie that's coming out this Christmas and the screenplay is 
really terrific." I agreed to interview Affleck, but never got around to 
it. For a guy playing a charismatic jock, Affleck seemed flat, 
uninteresting and not worth the bother.
Even after the release of "Good Will Hunting," the wonderful film to 
which Davies referred, I didn't regret passing Affleck over. His growing 
status as a sex symbol left me mystified and, as an actor, he seemed 
merely serviceable. From "Armageddon" through "Shakespeare in Love," I 
simply didn't understand all the fuss about Ben Affleck, until about four 
hours ago, when I saw "Forces of Nature."
Affleck is sweet, disarming and utterly natural in the romantic road 
comedy. Working in turns with Sandra Bullock and Maura Tierney, he hits 
just the right notes to establish a winning chemistry with each. Thanks 
to fine performances from the uniformly strong cast, a surprisingly smart,
 unpredictable plot and some jazzy visuals, "Forces of Nature" overcomes 
pacing problems to emerge a winner.
Affleck plays Ben Holmes, a reserved copywriter about to marry the 
winsome Bridget ("NewsRadio's" Maura Tierney) at her parents' home in 
Savannah. Shortly after meeting fellow passenger Sarah (Sandra Bullock) 
at a New York airport, their plane blows an engine, skids off the runway 
and leaves a traumatized Ben determined to seek alternate transportation 
to the South. Sarah joins him and, faster than you can say "Planes, 
Trains and Automobiles," Ben's carefully arranged life is turned upside 
down. 
Their contrived misadventures are amusing, but the rewards of "Forces of 
Nature" come from the characterizations. Writer Marc Lawrence deserves a 
great deal of credit for integrity. Elderly people play a large part in 
the story, but Lawrence never mocks or trivializes them. Ben and Sarah 
squabble, but never become shrill. The delightful Maura Tierney's Bridget,
while playing a secondary role as the anxious bride-to-be in Savannah, 
is allowed to be a real person rather than just a plot device. And the 
ending, in open defiance of contemporary date-movie conventions, is both 
ethical and unexpected.
The film boasts some nice eye candy as well. A couple scampers through a 
tire graveyard while hail falls in gorgeous slow-motion. Later, the style 
is successfully revisited during a enchanting overhead shot of slo-mo 
raindrops. Perhaps the loveliest scene occurs late in the film, when two 
characters have a key exchange while a wind-storm surrounds them in a 
otherworldly swirl straight out of a fairy tale.  
In addition to Affleck's disarming performance, Bullock finally makes 
amends for the godawful "Speed 2: Cruise Control." As a damaged soul 
desperately clinging to a free-spirit persona, her work here could aptly 
be subtitled "How Sandra Got Her Groove Back." Beneath her sprightly 
characterization lies an air of melancholy that gives her a resonance 
lacking in most of her recent films. It's nice to see Bullock back on 
track again.
Affleck and Bullock are terrific together, particularly in a riotous 
strip scene in a gay bar that manages to be funny without pandering or 
reinforcing stereotypes. Almost as good is a segment where the cash-
strapped couple race to pick up some money wired to a telegraph office, 
only to find the building engulfed in flames. "I think I'll just sit here,
'' Ben chuckles, "and wait for the locusts to come."
The production has a few too many MTV moments, and the film bogs down in 
spots, crossing the line between leisurely and languid, but the lapses 
are forgivable due to the fine blend of humor and intelligence. Along 
with the laughs is a quiet examination of the nature of love and 
commitment, presented with welcome understatement. When the film reaches 
its climax, you may be surprised with the resolution, but you'll 
certainly respect it.
"Forces of Nature" combines the sensibility of vintage screwball comedies 
with a maturity rarely seen on screen these days. And it provides Ben 
Affleck with a whale of a showcase for his talents. In the unlikely event 
of my chatting with Jeremy Davies again, one thing's for sure: if he 
suggests that I talk with a talented unknown, I'll take his advice.

They should have called it "Babe: Pig in Gotham City." This dark sequel 
to the 1995 hit has virtually none of the bucolic charm displayed in the 
original. Instead, we get a grim parade of unpleasant characters, ugly 
imagery, overlong chases and numerous scenes of animals in distress. 
While imaginative and technically impressive, "Babe: Pig in the City" is 
one of the most depressing family films I have ever seen. What in the 
world were the filmmakers thinking? 
The original "Babe" won the hearts of audiences around the world with its 
simple tale of a little talking pig with a big heart. The delightful 
Australian film introduced Babe, a porcine youngster adopted by dogs 
after the death of its mother. The story followed Babe's adventures on 
the farm; getting to know Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) and his wife 
(Magda Szubanski), interacting with the other animals, and achieving 
success as the world's first shepherding pig. 
"Babe: Pig in the City" takes a wrong turn in its opening moments, with a 
slapstick well accident that is too realistically filmed to be funny. The 
accident sidelines Farmer Hoggett for most of the film, shifting the 
human focus from the kindly, soft-spoken man to his fussy, easily 
flustered wife. Bad move. 
With the farm in financial trouble, Mrs. Hoggett accepts a lucrative 
offer for Babe to appear in a shepherding demonstration and the pair 
takes off for the big city, with Babe's pal, a neurotic duck, frantically 
attempting to keep up with the airplane so he can watch over his friend. 
Hoggett and Babe miss a vital plane connection when a drug-sniffing dog's 
barking, an attempt to show-off for Babe, results in Mrs. Hoggett being 
hauled off by authorities for a full-body search.
Stranded in the city, Hoggett and Babe end up at a picturesque flea-bag 
hotel, where the pig meets a number of hardened city animals, including a 
surly group of performing monkeys, owned by a gross, ill-tempered clown 
(Mickey Rooney). When Mrs. Hoggett gets arrested in yet another mix-up 
and the clown dies (are we having fun yet?), the animals are left to fend 
for themselves. After a nasty encounter with some attack dogs, Babe saves 
a pitbull from drowning and forges an alliance between the animals. 
Almost as quickly as everyone makes friends, animal control agents storm 
the hotel, capturing most of the terrified creatures and hauling them 
away. Will Babe survive? Will Mrs. Hoggett be able to rescue the critters?
 Will your children be able to get through all of this without crying?  
Thankfully, there are at least a few sunny, clever images in "Pig in the 
City" to lighten the harsh proceedings a bit. An aerial shot of a duck 
hitching a ride in the roomy mouth of a seagull is witty. An elaborate 
set piece involving two characters springing around a large room on 
elastic bands is fun (it also serves as a lively homage to another film 
from director George Miller -- "Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"). Distant 
shots of the town, an amalgam featuring landmarks from many different 
cities, cast a nice storybook feel and, of course, there's the inherent 
charm of watching cute little animals talk. 
There are far more talking animal scenes here than in the first film and, 
for the most part, they are even more convincing. Christine Cavanaugh, 
the voice of Babe in the original, wanted more money than the producers 
were willing to pay, so E.G. Daily of "Rugrats" fame takes over the vocal 
chores and does good work, making Babe sound just as adorable this time 
around. If only the rest of the film was as sweet.
Instead, in addition to the aforementioned disturbing images, audiences 
are treated to the spectacle of a dog dangling from a bridge with its 
head under water, flailing desperately to avoid drowning. Another scene 
shows a disabled pup on a small cart, dragged at high speeds behind a 
truck, then released to flip over and over on the sidewalk. It's a 
shocking image likely to traumatize children, even though the dog is 
shown alive a few moments later. 
A press junket and premiere for "Babe: Pig in the City" were canceled at 
the last minute, supposedly to allow more time to complete special effect 
shots for the film. Insiders report that, in fact, a test screening drew 
extremely negative reactions from the audience and the film underwent an 
emergency edit to make it more family friendly. It's scary to realize 
that the film I saw is the toned-down version.  
The big question, of course, is why? Why did the filmmakers all but 
remove James Cromwell from the movie? Why did they surround an enchanting 
little pig with foul-tempered characters and repulsive imagery? Why did 
they take one of the most creatively substantial fairy tales in years and 
crank out a garish sequel with violence and chases substituting for wit? 
"Babe" was one of the nicest surprises of the '90s. "Babe: Pig in the 
City" is also a surprise; a disappointing, depressing one.

After watching "Rat Race" last week, I noticed my cheeks were sore and
realized that, when not laughing aloud, I had held a grin for virtually
all of the film's 112 minutes. Saturday night, I attended another sneak
preview for the movie and damned if I didn't enjoy it as much the second
time as the first. "Rat Race" is a great goofy delight, a dandy mix of
energetic performances, inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness.
Hands down, this is the most fun film of the summer.
The movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like
they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy, featuring
animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding
around the screen. Then comes the setup.
Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), the extremely rich owner of the Venetian
Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, enjoys concocting unusual bets for his
high rolling clients. To that end, he places a half dozen very special
tokens in his slot machines. Gathering together the lucky token holders,
he explains, "Today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of
winning are one in six." The competition is simple: Each contestant gets
a key that opens a locker in Silver City, N.M., containing $2 million in
cash. There is a transmitter in every key, so that Sinclair and his
cronies can keep track of who is ahead. The race has no rules 
whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money.
Since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes, let's use the next
few paragraphs to profile the racers.
Decked out in flashy, trashy clothing and sporting big hair, Vera Baker
(Whoopi Goldberg) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up
for adoption as a baby. She finds that grown-up Merrill (Lanai Chapman)
is erudite, conservative and more than a little bit wary of this
stranger trying to jump into her life. Thrown together, it becomes clear
that both women share a fierce competitive nature.
Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is currently the most hated man in
America. An NFL referee, he cost gamblers all over the country enormous
amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game. After
escaping from a vengeful cab driver, Owen gets to New Mexico by
masquerading as the driver for a busload of Lucy Ricardo impersonators
heading to a convention.
Mr. Pollini (Rowan Atkinson) is a cheerful, odd little Italian man on
holiday in America. He also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most
inopportune times. Pollini hitches a ride with Zack (Wayne Knight), a
hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a
transplant operation.
Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) promised his wife Beverly (Kathy Najimy) and two
kids a fun-filled vacation in Las Vegas. Fearful that Beverly will be
angry over his involvement in the race, he claims that he must travel to
Silver City for a job interview. Beverly insists the family stay
together, so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert.
Brothers Duane (Seth Green) and Blaine (Vince Vieluf) Cody are young,
crooked and stupid. Blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly
self-done tongue piercing, and Duane is the only person who can come
close to understanding him. The boys will stop at nothing to reach their
goal.
Finally, Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer) is a no-nonsense
lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot Tracy Faucet (Amy
Smart) for the journey. At first glance, they seem blandly wholesome,
but all that changes when Tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend Shawn
(Dean Cain) and spies him swimming with another woman.
Director Jerry Zucker ("Airplane," "Ghost") leaps from racer to racer,
periodically returning to Las Vegas where Sinclair and Mr. Grisham (Dave
Thomas), his personality-impaired right hand man, continue cooking up
bizarre bets for the gamblers. As with any Zucker production, a few
jokes fall flat, but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those
missteps. High points for me include a bit involving Kathy Bates as a
roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries
Jon Lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally, with an
utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off.
Had I been part of the filmmaking team, I would have ditched a joke
where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get
lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron. It would have drawn the
same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation. I also
would have selected a different band for a concert sequence. My God, do
we really need yet another movie with Smash Mouth performing "All Star?"
But enough carping. "Rat Race" is a riot, with terrific no-holds-barred
performances from the diverse cast. See it, see it again and when the
DVD comes out, buy it, because a movie this hilarious will surely have
outtakes to die for.

What a year 2000 has been for director Steven Soderbergh. After
releasing "Out of Sight" and "The Limey" in 1999 to great critical
acclaim, but little attention from filmgoers, the 37-year-old hit two
out of the ballpark in 2000, beginning the year with "Erin Brokovich"
and wrapping it up with "Traffic," a rich, multi-layered look at the
illegal drug industry, based on a five hour 1989 British miniseries.
Soderbergh tackles a lot with this bold, uncompromising project and
pulls it off in grand fashion, with only a few missteps along the way.
To his credit, Soderbergh never gets on the soapbox about the American
government's highly trumpeted, controversial "War on Drugs." "We were
trying to personalize all of it, on both sides of the issue," he told
USA Today. "Nobody in law enforcement will look at you with a straight
face and say, 'We are winning the war on drugs.' And that's really all
that we're laying out."
The film shifts between four storylines, using various color tints and
film stocks for the different scenarios. It begins with bleached out
sepia tones in Tijuana, where local cops Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del
Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) intercept a large cocaine
transaction in the desert, only to have General Salazar (Tomas Milian)
and his troops swoop in and take the stash.
Cut to upscale America and blue hues as Ohio State Supreme Court Justice
Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) prepares to become our country's new
drug czar. What the judge doesn't know is that his 16-year-old daughter,
Caroline (Erika Christensen), has just been introduced to the joys of
freebasing.
Bold colors and raw stock dominate as we shift to Southern California,
where DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis
Guzman) conduct a sting on mid-level dealer, Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel
Ferrer), hoping to force him to turn informant.
Meanwhile, pregnant and glowing Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones)
glides regally through the upper crust life, unaware that her husband,
Carlos (Steven Bauer) is the drug kingpin being sought by the agents for
supplying Ruiz and many, many others.
Soderbergh juggles the storylines with grace and style, using hand-held
cameras and well-chosen jump cuts to maintain a sense of immediacy.
Although the film features a whopping 130 speaking parts, keeping track
of the participants is not difficult.
Because of his reputation as an actor's director, Soderbergh has no
trouble landing talent and this production features his most dazzling
roster yet. Down to the smallest part, the casting is impeccable, with a
number of standouts. "Boogie Nights" veterans Don Cheadle and Luis
Guzman make a great team, with Cheadle's buttery voice and bright
demeanor contrasting neatly with Guzman's gritty tones and bulldog
nature. Miguel Ferrer, who consistently stole scenes in "Twin Peaks" as
Albert, the deliciously caustic FBI agent, bristles with desperate
indignation while radiating a feral sexuality as a dealer backed into a
corner. As usual, Catherine Zeta-Jones simmers with a potent combination
of intelligence and unnerving serenity. Best of all is Benicio Del Toro,
whose weathered face and deep, soulful eyes mesh perfectly with his
tired, but unstoppable character. Often cast as a villain, Del Toro is
far more effective as a hero.
The movie has some problem areas, most springing from Stephen Gaghan's
script. The transformation of Zeta-Jone's character once she learns the
truth about her husband is needlessly abrupt; an extra scene depicting
her struggling with the revelation might have smoothed things out.
Michael Douglas' character would also have benefited from some
additional shading. Initially, he comes off as anemic and tentative.
Later, when he goes to rescue his daughter, he appears overly
reminiscent of Charles Bronson in "Death Wish," with periodic echoes of
his own attack mode persona in "Falling Down."
But the shakiest portions of the film deal with security measures,
specifically those involving a car bomb and an assassin out to make a
hit. Revealing the details would spoil a couple of scenes, so I'll
simply say this: If you ever become famous, DO NOT hire these officers
as bodyguards.
Some critics have faulted "Traffic" for wrapping its storylines
ineffectually, but I disagree. The conclusions presented simply reflect
what happens in the real world when lives become immersed in drugs. Some
people live, while others die. Some users keep using, while others go
into recovery and try to hang on. Some dealers flourish, while others
eventually get caught. The bottom line remains the same: The government
will continue their war, however ill-conceived, but they will not win,
because too many of us are driven to self-medicate and, as long as there
is a market, the dealers will find a way.

Review for Wedding Singer, The (1998)
The Wedding Singer (1998)

Glave, Christine Taylor, Steve Buscemi, Ellen Albertini Dow, Billy Idol.

It would be easy to dismiss "The Wedding Singer." The film is admittedly 
fluff; just another throwaway comedy from a Saturday Night Live alumnus. 
The characters are mostly two-dimensional and the jokes are obvious and 
often corny. But the central romantic storyline is so sweet and good 
natured that it's fairly easy to overlook the film's many shortcomings. 
Ultimately, "The Wedding Singer" succeeds as light entertainment, a 
surprising triumph of charm over shtick.
Set in 1985, the story focuses on Robby Hart (Adam Sandler,) a former 
rock star wannabe who earns his living singing at weddings. Robby is very 
good at his job, as evidenced in the opening scene, when a drunken best 
man (Steve Buscemi) turns a toast into a hateful tirade and Robby's adept 
damage control defuses the volatile situation. An incurable romantic, 
Robby's world comes crashing down around him when his childhood 
sweetheart (Angela Featherstone) leaves him standing at the altar. He 
collapses into a bundle of pain and self-pity, only to be drawn out by 
Julia (Drew Barrymore,) an innocent young co-worker engaged to a 
philandering stud (Matthew Glave.) Will Robby and Julia escape their 
wretched fates and find true love together? You do the math.
>From a script by Judd Apatow, Carrie Fisher and Tim Herlihy, "The Wedding 
Singer" operates on two very elementary levels. There's the love story, 
of course, which is straightforward and sentimental without getting too 
sticky. The rest of the film is broad comedy, playing off the pop culture 
and manners of the mid-80s. Predictably, the film makes great sport of 
the entertainment and fashions of the period. Julia's fiancee wears the 
latest "Miami Vice" pastel outfits, complete with a perpetual three-day 
growth of beard. Other supporting characters ape the fashion stylings of 
Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson, while jokes about Rubik's Cubes, 
"Dallas,"  A Flock Of Seagulls and Van Halen are self-consciously 
inserted. The gags about the 80s are sometimes funny, despite being 
overly obvious and smug. In a few years, we'll probably be subjected to 
comedies looking back on those wacky days in the 90s, featuring tattooed, 
multi-pierced characters in droopy trousers prattling on about Laser Tag, 
"South Park," and the Spice Girls. The film's most tired joke involves an 
elderly person acting "hip," in this case an old lady "bustin' a move" to 
the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." Back in 1972, Ruth Gordon 
pioneered the "isn't it hilarious when octogenarians use trendy slang and 
swear" genre of comedy in "Harold and Maude." It was funny then, but only 
for about half of the film. 26 years later, the joke is annoying beyond 
belief. 
So why is "The Wedding Singer" getting a marginal recommendation? Because 
of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler. Barrymore has grown from "that cute 
little girl in 'E.T.'" into a beautiful, fresh-faced young woman. A few 
years ago, Barrymore appeared on David Letterman's show the night he was 
celebrating his birthday. As her gift, she danced on his desk, at one 
point turning her back on the audience and briefly flashing her breasts 
at Dave. On numerous occasions, Letterman has talked about his fond 
memories of the incident, always describing Barrymore as "charming" and 
"sweet." It's easy to understand why he'd feel that way. Barrymore 
possesses such an air of innocence that actions that might seem vulgar if 
done be others come off as playful and disarming. As Julia, she is a 
delight, radiating a fresh-scrubbed goodness and generating real 
chemistry with Sandler. 
For his part, Sandler does his best film work to date, playing an actual 
person for the first time. Sandler, who can somehow look handsome and 
gooney simultaneously, is an intriguing performer, with a career built on 
playing a variety of whining half-wits. He's the kind of comic who is 
often funny, but just as often so irritating that you'd like to take a 
swing at him. In "The Wedding Singer," Sandler reigns in his more 
annoying character traits for the most part, playing a veritable Boy 
Scout lost in the self-centered, hedonistic 80s. If he continues in this 
vein and avoids reverting to his idiot persona, he may actually be able 
to play a full-fledged adult someday.
In addition to Sandler and Barrymore, "The Wedding Singer" boasts a 
terrific soundtrack, packed with great songs from the 80s. Pretend-punk 
Billy Idol even makes a cameo appearance, playing himself in the film's 
cheesy, but satisfying climax.
Thanks to Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, "The Wedding Singer" is a 
modest success, offering laughs and a tender romance to boot. The film is 
just a trifle, but in the mid-winter cinematic wasteland, you have to 
grade on a curve.

At the end of an action scene in "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," a wall
collapses near the nubile warrior. With her face on the floor, she gazes
into the rubble, then grins abruptly and says "Oh, my car keys!" I
mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned
production that made me smile.
Based on an incredibly popular video game, "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" is
a lousy movie. The structure goes like this: Poorly-staged action
sequence, boring exposition, poorly-staged action sequence, boring
exposition, etc. etc., The End. Basically, the film exists to showcase
Angelina Jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits. Close-ups are framed
oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms. Running scenes
highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage "Baywatch" fashion. There's
even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them.
But the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience
correctly. The one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this
- a guy. For no particular reason, a muscular supporting character
strolls around naked for about 30 seconds, with each shot composed to
barely cover his package, ŕ la "Austin Powers." Now, I enjoy a good
looking male body as much as the next gay guy, but what the hell is
beefcake doing in a T&A flick aimed at heterosexual males?
Of course, what else should one expect in a film that does virtually
nothing right? "Tomb Raider" sets up elaborate action set pieces, then
renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing (a
promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts). It
promises a series of exotic locales, then delivers cavernous sets and
grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies. Throw in some bargain basement
computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the
pike in many moons.
Intended to be a rousing "Indiana Jones" style adventure, "Tomb Raider"
lacks any sense of tension. The low point comes when Lara is
"threatened" by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed Shiva
figure that come to life courtesy of CGI. Easily the lamest menaces I
have ever seen, the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a
single shot from a gun. If you ever have to be chased by monsters, pray
that you get the monkey warriors.
"Tomb Raider" tells a story, sort of. Once every 5,000 years, the
planets align. A group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an
object that, if reassembled just as the planets align, will give them
control OVER TIME ITSELF. Lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her
long-missing poppa (Jon Voight, Jolie's real life dad). None of this
matters though, because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the
plot of "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" is as lame as ever other aspect of the
film  except Angelina Jolie's lips and breasts.

Both "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty" feature sweet tales of friendship 
between two boys. Both films are also quite flawed, albeit in different 
ways, and your tolerance of those flaws will likely depend on whether or 
not the central storyline strikes an emotional chord with you.
Like "Simon Birch," "The Mighty" deals with a pair of young male outcasts 
who bond together. Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) is unusually small and 
can walk only with braces, the result of a progressive, degenerative 
disease called Morquio syndrome. The bright kid spends most of his time 
in the world of books and the imagination, where, unencumbered by his 
physical limitations, he can slay dragons and rescue damsels in distress 
as a knight in King Arthur's court. 
Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson) is a stocky, quiet and very lonely illiterate.
 The boy lives in his grandparents' basement, hiding from the cruel 
taunts of classmates and his own painful memories of one horrific night 
that tore his family apart. When Kevin (also known as "Freak") and his 
loving, fiercely protective mother (Sharon Stone) move in next door, 
everything changes. The 13-year-olds eventually become friends, each 
making up for the others limitations. With Kevin perched atop Max's 
shoulders, they become a powerful single unit. As Max puts it, "Freak was 
the brain, and I was the legs." Together, they venture forth confidently 
as a symbiotic knight in urban Cincinnati. 
Based on "Freak The Mighty," the beloved Rodman Philbrick novel, "The 
Mighty" is a solid, often moving story about the pain of being ostracized 
and the healing power of friendship. Unlike "Simon Birch," which used an 
overbearing score and contrived situations to emotionally bully the 
viewer, "The Mighty" avoids overt manipulation. The central storyline is 
strong enough to play without orchestration, although a subplot involving 
Max's dad and his miscreant friends is heavy-handed, to put it mildly.
With a creation like this, chemistry is everything and the producers of 
"The Mighty" made some interesting casting decisions. 21-year-old Elden 
Henson is perfect as 13-year-old Max, despite the startling age gap. He 
captures the tortured young man's bottled-up pain splendidly, projecting 
strong emotions with an economy of expression. Henson is so good that he 
nearly makes up for Kieran Culkin's deficits. 
Reportedly, "Simon Birch's" Ian Michael Smith, who has Morquio syndrome 
in real life, was turned down for the role of Kevin, and Culkin is simply 
too big to play the part. Beyond the physical incongruity, Culkin 
projects an extremely arrogant, smarmy air. While I empathized with the 
character, I didn't like him. Despite his distasteful smugness, though, 
there is an undeniable chemistry between the boys.
Sharon Stone is quite strong as Kevin's devoted mother, giving one of the 
best performances of her career, and Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton 
are solid, if underused, as Max's grandparents. Two other supporting 
performances must be noted. Meat Loaf plays Max's father and as an actor, 
he's a good singer. Finally, Gillian Anderson is embarrassingly bad as a 
drunken floozy, coming off like a bush-league version of Faye Dunaway in 
"Mommie Dearest." 
Had the filmmakers cast Ian Michael Smith as Kevin and given the heave-ho 
to some of the film's secondary elements (including Gillian Anderson), 
"The Mighty" would have been a much more satisfying production. The film 
still resonates as is, thanks to its universal themes and Elden Henson's 
fine work, but, like "Simon Birch," "The Mighty" ultimately plays as a 
charming portrait of friendship trapped in an unexceptional movie.

Title
Review for Mrs. Brown (1997)
"Mrs. Brown" is one of the years best films; a charming, unconventional 
love story that is refreshing and utterly captivating. The film deals 
with the British monarchy, but rest assured, this is not one of those 
slow, staid period films. Rather, "Mrs. Brown" is a warm, graceful and 
often funny portrait of two very striking individuals.
Set in 1864, "Mrs. Brown" introduces us to a deeply depressed Queen 
Victoria. Three years after the death of her husband, the Queen (Judi 
Dench) is still mourning, forcing her family and staff to share her 
seclusion in Windsor. She adheres to her daily routine religiously, 
seeing no one but servants and relatives and avoiding all political 
matters. She wraps her depression around her like a comforter. Of course 
she's miserable, but it's a familiar misery, and that familiarity offers 
some solace. The staff, dreadfully tired of being "prisoners of the 
Queen's grief" and fearful of the political ramifications of her 
isolation, send for John Brown (Billy Connolly), the Highland equestrian 
caretaker of her Scottish retreat in Balmoral. Their hope is that Brown, 
a friend of her late husband's, can at least get her outside for periodic 
horse rides, a potential first step towards emergence from her self-
imposed isolation.
Brown arrives at Windsor and makes an immediate impression. The brash 
Scotsman has his own ideas of how things should be done and refuses to 
let propriety stop him from speaking his mind. During their first meeting,
 he looks at her with alarm, stating "You look terrible, woman!" The 
Queen and staff are horrified at his impudence, but in short order, 
Victoria warms to Brown's bold, protective manner. The two become fast 
friends, with an unspoken, but obvious love that prompts scandalous talk 
in the sexually repressed nation. Victoria is soon dubbed "Mrs. Brown" by 
political wags, while the nation speculates on the true nature of the 
Queen's shocking relationship with this commoner.
The story, a blend of facts and speculation, allows director John Madden 
to present a detailed portrait of the era, while shrewdly satirizing the 
politics and manners of the time. But far more important is the 
extraordinary character study of Queen Victoria and John Brown. Dench and 
Connolly are magnificent, a wonderfully mismatched couple with amazing 
chemistry. Connolly is a marvel; a swaggering bull of a man who takes 
guff from no one. He speaks when he wants, drinks when he wants and is 
utterly devoted to her majesty. His impudent remarks, and the stunned 
reaction of the staff and family, provide some of the film's funniest 
moments. Dench is equally impressive as Queen Victoria. She is 
convincingly regal, yet totally human; a haughty, incredibly proper 
monarch who wants to savor life, but has no idea how to go about it. 
The pairing of Connolly and Dench is sheer magic and deserves to be 
rewarded when the Oscar nominations roll around. Watching Victoria 
blossom through Brown's loving ministrations is exhilarating. One of the 
film's best scenes comes when Brown spirits Victoria away to visit a poor 
couple in the Highlands. The interactions between the four during their 
evening together leaves the viewer with an almost giddy feeling. The 
Queen's subsequent emergence from her shell is invigorating, a triumph of 
love and the human spirit over societal oppression. Director Madden also 
draws fine performances from the supporting cast, particularly Anthony 
Sher as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Achingly beautiful Scottish 
locations are used to great effect in conjunction with an excellent 
musical score. In fact, the film's only problem is that it had to come to 
an end.
So what was the true nature of Victoria and John Brown's relationship. 
We'll never know for sure, but consider this. Following Brown's death, 
Victoria maintained his room in pristine condition and placed a flower on 
his pillow every day until her death 18 years later. At her request, she 
was buried with his photograph in her hand. Draw your own conclusions and 
don't miss this jewel of a movie.
One of the years best films; a charming, unconventional love story that 
is refreshing and utterly captivating. Set in 1864, a Highland equestrian 
(Billy Connolly) is summoned to serve a gravely depressed Queen Victoria 
(Judi Dench). Dench and Connolly are magnificent, a wonderfully 
mismatched couple with amazing chemistry. Rest assured, this is not one 
of those slow, staid period films. Rather, "Mrs. Brown" is a warm, 
graceful and often funny portrait of two very striking individuals.
The President's plane is hijacked by terrorists in this entertaining "Die 
Hard" clone. The combination of extremely well-detailed lead characters 
and a constantly escalating sense of tension is what makes "Air Force 
One" succeed. Director Wolfgang Petersen is very good at creating winning 
action/thrillers out of preposterous scripts. "Air Force One" has holes 
in logic large enough to fly a plane through, but Petersen spins the tale 
so well that ultimately, it doesn't matter. Ford makes a great President 
and Oldman is effective as a Russian zealot.
Swinton plays a young lawyer on the fast track to success who becomes 
plagued with anxiety and misgivings, made worse by the arrest of her 
sister (Madigan). The film's fantasy sequences leave much to be desired, 
but the powerfully acted story effectively addresses fundamental 
questions about family, sex, and a woman's place in contemporary society.
Kiddie flick from Nickelodeon tells of two amiable goofballs and their 
misadventures in the fast food world. War erupts between the staff of 
Good Burger and rivals at the evil Mondo Burger that opens across the 
street. Adults will be bored silly, but the little ones should enjoy the 
familiar antics of Mitchell and Thompson.

Title
Review for Jerry Maguire (1996)
JERRY MAGUIRE (1996)
Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr. Directed by Cameron Crowe
*** and one half stars (out of *****)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
In 1983, Tom Cruise became a star in the brash comedy "Risky Business." 
In the ensuing years, he has made films that ranged from the sublime 
("Rainman") to the...well, to "Days Of Thunder." In the exuberant "Jerry 
Maguire," Cruise's outstanding performance is a powerful reminder that 
beneath that dazzling smile lies one hell of an actor.
Jerry Maguire is an extremely powerful sports agent, a shark who 
manipulates his superstar clients with a combination of ass-kissing and 
motivational seminar babble, while securing them obscene amounts of money 
from team-owners and endorsement packages. One night, in a crisis of 
conscience, he pounds out an inspirational  "mission statement", 
encouraging his company to shift their attitude and focus on fewer 
clients (which, of course, means less money.) Shortly after distributing 
his manifesto, he recognizes that he has committed corporate suicide, but 
the damage is done. Within days, he is fired, and finds himself starting 
over, with one client (Gooding), one employee (Zellweger), and a strong 
sense of desperation.
Jerry Maguire isn't a simple story of redemption. Director Cameron Crowe 
("Say Anything", "Singles") is far more clever. Maguire doesn't 
necessarily want to stop being a shark. He still thrives on the 
adrenaline-charged lifestyle, on being a power player. What he wants is a 
home base, a safe place where he can connect with others on a more human 
level. The joy of the film comes from the unexpected twists in his 
personal journey, and the extremely rich supporting cast.
Cuba Gooding Jr. Is electric as Rod Tidwell, a wide receiver for the 
Arizona Cardinals. He yearns to be a spoiled superstar; for the sheer 
thrill of it, to be sure, but also to build a secure future for his 
loving family. Gooding's outbursts, both of temperament and exhilaration, 
provide some of the film's most satisfying moments.
Playing Maguire's assistant, Renee Zellweger gives a subtle and rich 
performance. As an idealistic single mother, she initially seems 
painfully naďve, but as her relationship with Maguire builds, the 
strength and inherent decency beneath her wide-eyes emerges. The love 
story between her, Maguire and her young son (six year old charmer 
Jonathan Lipnicki, with a beatific smile that lights up the theater) is 
compelling and absolutely credible, a rarity in contemporary films.
After its frenetic start, Jerry Maguire leads viewers on a funny and 
moving tale of love and growth. The combination of Crowe's exceptional 
script and the superior cast, highlighted by Cruise's flawless 
performance, results in one of the years most substantial movies.

Like a kid waiting for Christmas morning, I've been counting the days
until the release of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." While the prospect
of a beyond-the-grave collaboration between filmmakers Stanley Kubrick
and Steven Spielberg was exciting, what really juiced me up was the
concept, because the era of sentient machines is coming.
Our brightest minds will construct mechanical beings that independently
think and feel. Their first efforts will be crude, and we will need to
treat the androids with the sort of extra patience we reserve for our
mentally limited loved ones. Over the years, these creations will grow
ever more sophisticated, eventually improving on their own design
without the aid of man.
There will be controversy, of course. Some will claim that such efforts
are an affront to God, while others will insist that we are simply
carrying out the next step in a divine plan. How we behave towards these
children of mankind will measure our own humanity. Will we dismiss them
as mere appliances or treat them with condescension, regarding them as
slave labor made to serve our needs? Hopefully, we will come to
recognize them as an equal life form, leading to an age where organic
and mechanical beings work together (Cue the orchestra as I continue my
Captain Picard rant).
I picture a faraway time when a human can opt for earthly immortality by
moving his or her consciousness to a designer body, co-existing with the
"pure" androids. Heck, there may even come a day when mentally superior
androids must remind themselves not to be patronizing to the less adept
cybernetic humans. Kind of makes you dizzy, eh?
"A.I." is an incredibly ambitious film that addresses these notions
along with many others. Loosely based on the short story "Supertoys Last
All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss, the production was Stanley Kubrick's
dream project for years. After collaborating with Steven Spielberg on
the particulars, Kubrick finally passed the film to Spielberg, believing
it was better suited to his sensibilities. Fractured, but dazzling, the
result is a dark, often cruel tale of obsession and intolerance. Ads for
the movie trumpet it as a fairy tale, but moms and dads should be aware
that this is a grim story that could trigger nightmares. Despite its
PG-13 rating, the film is appropriate only for very mature, reflective
children and then only if their folks also see the movie and set aside
time to discuss the images and issues. Anything less is irresponsible
parenting.
The futuristic drama is broken into three acts (SPOILER ALERT: The
following reveals basic plot elements). The first, set a few decades
from now, begins with the announcement from a professor (William Hurt)
of his intention to upgrade the current crop of robots by creating a
mechanical boy with a subconscious, capable of dreaming and experiencing
emotions. Twenty months later, David (Haley Joel Osment) moves in with
Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor), a couple
grieving the absence of their son, who was forced into cryogenic stasis
by illness. The exacting 50-minute segment is mesmerizing and maddening,
as a potentially workable situation grows intolerable due to a series of
misunderstandings that could have been corrected had the involved
parties simply talked things through.
But they don't, which leads to the second act, a fantastic journey
teaming David and his supertoy Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel) with Gigolo
Joe (Jude Law), a sex-robot on the run after being framed for murder by
a jealous husband. Together, they experience Flesh Fair, a "Thunderdome"
style extravaganza where runaway "mechas" (mechanical creations) are
tortured and destroyed for the amusement of twisted humans. Some of the
more visually horrific moments take place here.
Fueled by David's quest to find the Blue Fairy that can make him a "real
boy," just like Mommy read aloud in "Pinocchio" (how very sensitive of
her), they move on to Rouge City, a flashy, trashy neon enclave for
mechas. After a visit to "Dr. Know," a business where a cartoon hologram
(annoyingly voiced by Robin Williams) answers questions for a fee, the
trio moves on to Manhattan, flooded by melting polar ice caps to the
point where only the tops of buildings remain above water. Here David
has a fateful encounter that leads to the final act, set 2,000 years in
the future, with the distant descendants of the mechas (incorrectly
labeled as aliens in many reviews) providing the means for the story's
bizarre conclusion (END SPOILERS).
The tagline for "A.I.," "His love is real, but he is not" reflects a
fundamental problem with the movie. David can reason, care and suffer.
He is quite real. Sadly, his "love" is actually a programmed obsession
that blocks the boy from growing emotionally, but I'm not sure whether
or not Spielberg understands that. The relationship between David and
his "mommy" is about co-dependency, not love and the final scene of the
film, which I believe Spielberg considers satisfying, is but the last
painful image in an epic tragedy.
Flawed though it may be, "A.I." stands head and shoulders above most
films. I could go on for pages, but unfortunately, space is limited, so
I'll leave you with this: "A.I." is packed with freaky, haunting,
generally amazing images, accented by one of John Williams' better
scores. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are terrific, and the bleak story
offers a cornucopia of intriguing concepts. Adventurous filmgoers should
not miss this movie.

Review for Waiting for Guffman (1996)
Waiting For Guffman (1996)
Christopher Guest, Bob Balaban, Eugene Levy, Fred Willard, Catherine 
O'Hara. 
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Despite being married to Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Guest still 
manages to write and perform outstanding pieces of comedy. Frankly, I 
find this amazing. Were I married to Jamie Lee Curtis, I'd just follow 
her around the house all day. Getting any work done would be simply out 
of the question (oh sure, I'm gay, but we're talking about JAMIE LEE 
CURTIS here, for God's Sake!). But enough about my post-adolescent 
fantasies. Christopher Guest, one of the creators and stars of the 
brilliant comedy "This Is Spinal Tap", scores again with "Waiting For 
Guffman", a very funny bogus documentary about the 150th Anniversary 
festivities in Blaine, Missouri. 
Here's the set-up. The city leaders secure the services of transplanted 
New Yorker Corky St. Clair (Guest) to stage a musical celebrating 
Blaine's rich heritage (the town is famous for its wooden stools and a 
1946 UFO landing.) Guest is a riot as the effete St. Clair, a 
delightfully clueless off-off-off Broadway veteran. In Blaine, St. Clair 
is well-known for his stage production of "Backdraft". To create a more 
realistic feel, he sent bits of burning newspapers through the heating 
ducts. Oh sure, the theater caught fire, but the citizens of Blaine 
appreciate the great effort St. Clair put into his work. They also seem 
oblivious to the fact that St. Clair is a screaming queen. After all, 
he's married! Well, nobody has actually ever seen his wife, but they know 
she's real because St. Clair has often been sighted in the Women's 
clothing department of local stores, and he knows a great deal about 
depilatories. 
While Guest's performance is the center of "Waiting For Guffman," there 
are many more pleasures in this affectionate, low-key satire. Check out 
the expressions on the face of Bob Balaban, a local music teacher 
displaced as director by St. Clair. Balaban says little about the 
nightmare he sees being assembled, but he seethes beautifully. Eugene 
Levy, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are also delightful as wanna-be 
performers who are as enthusiastic as they are untalented. The finished 
play, "Red, White and Blaine" is a real hoot. It's bad, of course, but 
it's the kind of bad that's a real pleasure to watch. 
Several critics have attacked "Waiting For Guffman" as a smug, elitist 
slam on small town America. It isn't. "Waiting For Guffman" shows real 
affection for its characters. Most of the film's cast came from small 
towns and are all too familiar with the sheer weirdness of community 
theater. That peculiar mixture of little-to-no talent, combined with 
delusions of grandeur, is captured in all its glory here. "Guffman" isn't 
as funny as "This Is Spinal Tap," but few films are. Guest goes for a 
minor-key approach to humor this time, and succeeds far more often than 
not. Incidentally, be sure and stay for the film's closing credits, which 
contain some of the movie's funniest moments.

Last year, writer-director M. Night Shyamalan unveiled "The Sixth
Sense," a thoughtful, low-key thriller that became one of the biggest
hits of all time. In my initial notes for the film, I addressed the slow
pace of the story, scribbling "there's a thin line between deliberate
and plodding." After being flattened in the closing moments by
Shyamalan's now-legendary plot twist, I saw the movie again and decided
that, for the most part, the pacing was necessary for the payoff of the
story to work so well.
A year later, Shyamalan returns with "Unbreakable," another somber
mystery. Comparisons with "The Sixth Sense" are unavoidable, as both
films star Bruce Willis and feature compelling trailers promising an
exploration of otherworldly matters coupled with a surprise ending.
Sadly, "Unbreakable" lacks the punch of its predecessor, hampered by a
weak plot, anemic supporting characters and a needlessly abrupt wrap up.
As for pacing, forget "deliberate." "Plodding" is definitely the
operative word this time around.
The story begins in 1961 Philadelphia, with the birth of Elijah Price,
who enters the world with broken arms and legs. We learn that the child
suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a condition that renders bones
extremely brittle.
Cut to the present, as security guard David Dunn (Willis) heads home by
train following an out of town job interview. The camera acts as peeping
tom, gliding behind seats to catch David slipping off his wedding ring
and flirting with an attractive fellow passenger. When the young woman
moves away, he puts the ring back on and stares out the window, only to
notice that the train is going much too fast.
Later, David emerges from the examination area at a local emergency room
to find everyone staring at him. A physician explains that, of the 132
people onboard the train, David is the sole survivor of a nightmarish
derailment and he doesn't have a scratch on him.
Moved by the experience, David and his wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn)
agree to try and fix their strained relationship. Otherwise, life
returns to normal for the ex-football star, until he receives a note
reading, "How many days of your life have you been sick?" A bit of
investigation leads David to the author of the note, Elijah Price
(Samuel L. Jackson). The crippled man, a dealer in comic book art, moves
cautiously with a cane while projecting a skewed air of elegance.
Because of his disability, Elijah (nicknamed Mr. Glass) is obsessed with
the concept of strength, and he has a theory about David.
That's as much as can be revealed without spoiling the story.
Unfortunately, Shyamalan spoils the story on his own.
"The Sixth Sense" was able to twist and turn because the plot was rock
solid. Not so in "Unbreakable," which must rely on atmosphere and
coincidence to support its flimsy storyline. Actually, there is very
little story at all. What happens in the 107 minute running time would
serve as the first half of most movies. But Shyamalan drags moments out,
determined to establish and maintain an operatic tone. At times he
succeeds, and those grand hushed segments are a welcome change from the
noise and clutter of most films. But too often, he slides into tedium
and pretension.
And he simply didn't think through his own concept. In the course of the
film, David realizes that he possesses two highly unusual traits, which
begs the question: How in the world could a man go through his life
without noticing these things about himself?
I wanted to be swept away by "Unbreakable," but just couldn't make the
leap. Regardless of one's belief system (or lack thereof), life after
death fascinates most people, and "The Sixth Sense" drew on that allure.
But the supernatural concept in "Unbreakable" merely reflects adolescent
fantasizing. The idea doesn't resonate, and as a result, the
presentation style comes off as ponderous and overblown (the film is
reminiscent of a typical origin story from Marvel Comics, the sort of
thing that might be titled "And Thus a Hero Is Born").
Where "The Sixth Sense" gave us a number of fully realized characters,
"Unbreakable" offers two people and several rough sketches. Robin Wright
Penn has little to do except look pallid, while Spencer Treat Clark is
sympathetic, but generic as David and Audrey's son. Charlayne Woodard
sparkles as Elijah's mother, but only turns up for a few seconds.
In one of the lead parts, Bruce Willis suitably underplays his role,
projecting the unspoken frustration of a man who aches because he has
not lived up to his potential. But the real star of the show is Samuel
L. Jackson, who, with wild eyes and an unkempt Afro, casts a
mesmerizing, vaguely threatening presence. Jackson skillfully creates a
character that at once seems like a visionary and a crackpot, only to
betrayed by the screenplay.
"Unbreakable" concludes with a revelation and then just stops, with a
few on-screen sentences telling us what happened next. Imagine watching
Darth Vader intone, "Luke, I am your father," only to have the film
freeze at that point, with the words LUKE WENT ON TO GREATNESS, WHILE
DARTH VADER COMMITTED MANY MORE VILE DEEDS, REDEEMING HIMSELF ONLY
MOMENTS BEFORE HIS DEATH pasted over their faces and you'll know what to
expect.
M. Night Shyamalan is a talented writer and director. Hopefully, he'll
spend a little more time on the script before making his next AND THEN
THE REVIEW ENDED.

At first glance, "The Legend of Bagger Vance" appears to be simply an
inspirational sports story, directed by Robert Redford with his
customary elegance and economy. But there is something more going on
here. Based on Steven Pressfield's book, "Bagger Vance" takes two
renowned real-life Depression Era golfers and introduces them to a pair
of characters from an ancient Hindu holy book. The result is a
beautifully photographed, otherworldly fable that presents a Buddhist
look at spirituality, set against an exhibition golf match.
It takes place in the late 1920s in Savannah, Georgia. Adele Invergordon
(Charlize Theron) decides to save the golf resort she inherited from her
recently deceased father by staging a celebrity exhibition match
featuring the two undisputed stars of the game, Bobby Jones (Joel
Gretsch, in a star-making performance as a charismatic Atlanta
gentleman) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill, delightful as a flamboyant
Yankee). To appease town leaders that want a Savannah native in the
game, she reluctantly agrees to add a third player, one Rannulph Junuh
(Matt Damon).
Years ago, Junuh was her love, as well as the most promising young
golfer in the South. But upon his return from fighting in the war, he
became a recluse, shutting out Adele along with the rest of humanity,
save for a few drinking and gambling friends. Local boy Hardy Greaves
(J. Michael Moncrief) tries to convince Junuh to join the match, but the
shattered ex-soldier resists, until a mysterious man named Bagger Vance
(Will Smith) appears late in the night and offers his services as a
caddy, and as a guide to help Junuh "find his swing."
Jeremy Leven's script strips the already-streamlined book down to its
essence; Junuh's spiritual journey with Bagger Vance. Leven may have
stripped away a bit too much  the book introduces the two long after
their teacher/student dynamic has been established, where the film
depicts their relationship from the first meeting, with Vance initially
coming off as a folksy enigma at best and a flake at worst.
Director Robert Redford draws warm, understated performances from the
talented cast and creates a picture marked by good humor, rich tones and
a welcome sense of restraint and balance. Occasionally, the score gets a
bit heavy handed and the production skirts the edge of pretentiousness,
but Redford keeps matters in check most of the time.
Now here's the fascinating part. Although the author of the book does
not point this out, "Bagger Vance" is a retelling of a portion of the
Indian epic, "The Mahabharata," where Bhagavan, an honorific title for
the Lord or for a spiritual master (a title which sounds a lot like
Bagger Vance) helps Arjuna (which sounds exactly like R. Junuh) through
his spiritual crisis. Bhagavan aides Arjuna in recognizing who he really
is, how he fits into the texture of existence and how to find peace in
the midst of action.
Thanks to fine actors and Robert Redford's great directorial skills,
"The Legend of Bagger Vance" can be enjoyed without that information,
but placed in its proper context, the little truisms of the story become
pieces in a vast, exotic puzzle that offers contentment when fully
assembled.

There's something about Drew Barrymore that brings out the big brother in 
me. I'm not sure whether it's her genuinely sweet nature, the way she 
emerged triumphant from a rocky adolescence, or just some residual "E.T." 
magic, but the notion of criticizing such a charming young performer 
makes me uncomfortable. It should be obvious by this point that I'm going 
to do so anyway, but hopefully the preceding remarks will at least 
establish that I'm not happy about it.
"Never Been Kissed" is a lousy movie. The premise, while far from 
original, is serviceable enough. A fledgling reporter masquerades as a 
high school student to do a story on the youth of today. Several years 
earlier she suffered great pain as an outcast in school, and the 
assignment affords her the golden opportunity for a second chance. This 
time she'll get it right.
She doesn't, of course, and neither does the movie. The filmmakers behind 
"Never Been Kissed" apparently believe that as long as they provide a 
fuzzy-wuzzy romantic finale, it makes no difference how they get there. 
The movie makes virtually every mistake in the book, including flagrantly 
violating the moral of their own story. 
"Find out who you are and try not to be afraid of it," our 25 year old 
heroine nobly proclaims late in the film. This inspirational statement 
comes from a person who pretends to be someone she isn't and tries to 
insinuate herself with the vacuous school elite through patently phony 
affectations. She fails, only to be rescued when her 23 year old brother 
joins the charade and also re-enrolls, becoming an instant hit by downing 
a tub of cole slaw in the cafeteria, then bestowing his sister with 
popularity by telling the in-crowd how cool she is. Right.
Drew Barrymore was delightful in "The Wedding Singer," "Ever After" and 
even "Home Fries," but turns in a terribly strained performance here. As 
anal-retentive copy editor turned hapless reporter Josie Geller, she 
whines, winces and crinkles her eyes continuously, desperately trying to 
wring some pathos out of her poorly written character. In one of the 
worst cases of miscasting in years, she plays a high school loser who 
grew into a mousy adult. Buried under bad make-up, she is quite 
embarrassing but never convincing.
As a reporter, her character is even worse. We're expected to believe 
that a professional, whose job is to check facts, would fail to research 
teen fashion, instead showing up at school dressed like a go-go dancer 
from the '60s. We're expected to believe that a reporter would sit down 
with students she has just met and ask "What are you guys' hopes and 
dreams?" Nothing Josie Geller says or does is even remotely credible, 
especially her idiotic romantic gesture at the film's climax; an exercise 
in public humiliation that no human on Earth would subject themselves to 
in a million years, except in the wonderful world of contrived movies.
The awfulness doesn't stop with Barrymore. John C. Reilly, Mark 
Wahlberg's pornstar-pal in "Boogie Nights," is flat-out dreadful as 
Josie's boss, doing a wretched imitation of Lou Grant. Garry Marshall 
chews scenery as a management tyrant, and young Leelee Sobieski (the 
talented actor from "Deep Impact" who looks like Helen Hunt Jr.) has far 
too much innate poise and dignity to pull off her role as a contemporary 
high school geek.
About 40 minutes into the film, screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc 
Silverstein make matters even more annoying by slapping a hidden micro-
camera onto Josie, subjecting us to pointless "Truman Show" style 
reaction shots of Chicago Sun-Times staff members (get this) sitting 
around the office for hours and hours watching the monitor, enraptured by 
Josie's pratfalls and her quasi-romantic relationship with a teacher 
(Michael Vartan, an anemic-looking fellow inexplicably presented as a 
dreamboat). I can hardly wait to read what Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger 
Ebert has to say about how the film depicts the inner-workings of his 
newspaper.
There are a few bright spots in the production. Molly Shannon makes the 
most of her supporting role, particularly in an amusing scene where she 
pretends to be a sex-education teacher, and the always goofy David 
Arquette, despite looking too old to play Barrymore's younger brother, 
projects an odd giddiness that is fun to watch. In fact, his character, a 
lost young man who views the high-school re-enrollment facade as a last 
chance to realize his dream of becoming a ballplayer, is far more 
interesting and engaging than Josie.   
Subjecting an innocuous trifle like "Never Been Kissed" to so much 
bashing may seem excessive, but when hack filmmakers steal 107 minutes of 
my life, they deserve what they get. As for Drew Barrymore, hopefully 
she'll take a good look at this bad flick and be more selective when 
accepting future roles. She deserves better than this and so do we.

Remember the scene in "Scream 2" where the film student ranted about how 
slasher movie sequels are almost always crap? "I Still Know What You Did 
Last Summer" is a textbook example of everything he was talking about. 
Aside from a grim relentlessness, this generic offering has absolutely 
nothing to warrant a viewing. I'm required to see films like this -- it's 
in my job description -- but you don't have to.
In this colorless Xerox, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is away at 
school, dividing her time between nightmares and hallucinations of Ben 
Willis (Muse Watson), the slicker-wearing, hook-wielding killer from the 
original film. She continues her romantic involvement with fellow 
survivor Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but he's back home in North 
Carolina, and the distance, coupled with Julie's phobia about returning 
home, is straining their relationship.
Julie's chronically perky roommate Karla Wilson (Brandy) wins a vacation 
for four to the Bahamas and she invites her stressed-out girlfriend to 
come along. When Ray fails to show up, a dejected Julie takes off with 
Karla, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), Karla's horny boyfriend, and Will Benson 
(Matthew Settle), a boy-next-door type with a serious Julie fixation.
Of course, there's a good reason why Ray didn't show up. While traveling 
north with a buddy to surprise Julie, he encountered a body in the middle 
of the road. Oh my goodness, it's a trap! Quicker than you can say "here 
we go again," Ray's pal has a major new body piercing and our fisherman 
friend is chasing after Ray.
"I Know What You Did Last Summer" had a few qualities that raised it a 
notch or two above standard slasher fare. The dark murders were set 
against the background of a colorful small town festival and the contrast 
was refreshing. The kids were brighter than most denizens of slasher 
films and the mystery of the killer's identity livened things up somewhat.
"I Still Know" contains none of those elements. The film starts off grim 
and nasty and never wavers in tone. The Bahamian setting is murky and the 
action scenes lack a distinct sense of place. The supporting cast members 
are uniformly obnoxious and each primary actor has exactly one 
identifying characteristic, from which he or she never wavers.
Jennifer Love Hewitt is the most tiresome. She starts the film in a state 
of borderline hysteria, and the borderline soon disappears. Of course, 
the real star of the film isn't Hewitt, it's her breasts, which are 
featured so prominently in various form-fitting outfits that they almost 
deserve their own screen credit.
After the requisite false scares, the extremely bloody production settles 
into a repetitive, relentless groove, aping stylistic techniques from 
other genre films well enough to build some tension despite the 
inevitability of the story. If, after the first ten minutes of the film, 
you can't predict who will be alive at the conclusion, you're just not 
trying. 
True to form, there is the mandatory plot twist towards the end, and the 
film's godawful closing scene offers the possibility for yet another 
sequel. The prospect of a third installment of this derivative series is 
much scarier than anything that happens in the movie. In 1997, "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer" was a surprise hit. Hopefully, audiences will 
be discerning enough to make "I Still Know" a surprise failure.

"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is a raucous road comedy that operates
on three levels. Aficionados of crude humor will howl at the
obscenity-laden dialogue and raunchy sight gags. Film buffs will get
dizzy keeping up with the references, re-creations and parodies of
movies and rips at movie stars. And faithful followers of
writer/director/actor Kevin Smith's View-Askew Universe will be in hog
heaven, as virtually everyone from Smith's first four movies pops up to
say "Hello."
For those of you who haven't seen "Clerks, "Mallrats," "Chasing Amy" and
"Dogma," I'll try to give you a proper set-up (please bear in mind that
I am far from an expert  for more information, visit
www.viewaskew.com). Introduced to audiences in "Clerks," Jay (Jason
Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) have appeared in every Smith film, as well
as numerous comic books and a short-lived animated TV series. They even
did a walk-on in "Scream 3." Normally, the boys hang out in front of a
New Jersey convenience store, where Jay sells marijuana and yaps
incessantly, fixating on women and sex. Jay is an insult machine, with
his laid-back "hetero lifemate" Silent Bob the frequent recipient of
jabs attacking his weight and questioning his sexual orientation.
Jay and Silent Bob are also underground legends. In "Chasing Amy" we
learned that Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck, who also appears in "J&SBSB" as
himself) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee, who also appears here briefly as
"Mallrats" veteran Brodie Bruce) created a highly successful superhero
comic book series, "Bluntman and Chronic," based on Jay and Silent Bob.
When the two artists parted company, Holden gave the characters to
Banky, who struck a lucrative deal with a Hollywood studio, which brings
us to the beginning of "J&SBSB."
Are you still with me? If not, study the previous two paragraphs before
you see the film. Or just settle back and let the movie flow over you.
Spoiler Alert: The following reveals numerous plot points. I suggest you
read them, because knowing the plot will help you keep up with the
jokes.
As "J&SBSB" opens, Jay and Silent Bob find their lives turned upside
down when a restraining order bars them from holding court in front of
their beloved convenience store. To make matters worse, they learn that
strangers are mocking them online. Holden gives the boys (whose world is
so small that they don't know what the Internet is) a crash course in
Cyber Film Geekdom 101, showing them an "Ain't It Cool News" type Web
site and one of its bile-filled message boards. Taking the fanboy
attacks on Bluntman and Chronic personally, they decide to go after
Banky, who never got permission to use their personas in the film. Jay
and Silent Bob will travel to Hollywood and stop production of the
Bluntman and Chronic movie, by any means necessary.
Along the way, they will meet a stranger (George Carlin) who teaches
them hitchhiker sexual etiquette, and the "Scooby Doo" gang, who teach
them about teamwork. Jay will fall in love with the beguiling Justice
(Shannon Elizabeth). Her "Charlie's Angels" style friends Sissy (Eliza
Dushku), Chrissy (Ali Larter), and Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach, Smith's
wife), key figures in the militant animal rights group CLIT, will mock
the boys, even as they agree to participate in a raid on a product
testing lab. About a million clit jokes will be made as Federal Wildlife
Marshal Willenholly (Will Ferrell) pursues Jay, Silent Bob and their new
monkey friend across America.
In Hollywood, they will break onto a movie studio lot and watch Ben
Affleck and Matt Damon rehearse for "Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting
Season." Affleck and Damon will squabble with each other, taking shots
at each others movies; six ("Bounce, "The Talented Mr. Ripley," "All the
Pretty Horses," "The Legend of Bagger Vance," "Forces of Nature" and
"Reindeer Games") in less than 20 seconds! Mark Hamill will turn up for
a light saber battle and a paranoid director (Chris Rock) will rant
about racism. Finally, Jay and Silent Bob will face the big screen
versions of Bluntman and Chronic, played by James Van Der Beek and Jason
Biggs, prompting some juicy "Dawson's Creek" and "American Pie" jokes.
You will either find the whole affair hopelessly juvenile and indulgent
or you will laugh and laugh (how much depends on your knowledge of
movies in general and the Smith oeuvre in particular). If you belong to
GLAAD, you will hold a press conference and announce that the barrage of
gay jokes proves that the film is homophobic, completely missing the
point of Smith's ongoing exploration of the sexual insecurity that
prompts adolescent males (of all ages) to make such jokes. If you are
me, you will decide that, despite some dull spots and a few parodies
that are just too easy, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is wicked fun
and another feather in the cap of Kevin Smith.

Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Lost In Space (1998)
William Hurt, Gary Oldman, Matt Le Blanc, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, 
Jack Johnson, Lacey Chabert. Directed by Stephen Hopkins.
PG-13, 3 stars (out of 5 stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/
Archive reviews at http://us.imdb.com/M/reviews_by?Edward+Johnson-ott
Whenever Hollywood trots out its latest big budget film based on an old 
TV series, people invariably ask if it's as good as the original. In the 
case of "Lost In Space," the obvious answer is How could it not be? Irwin 
Allen's "Lost In Space," which ran from 1965 through '68, was quite 
possibly the lousiest show in the history of television. Nostalgic baby 
boomers remember it fondly as a camp classic. They are wrong. The film 
"Valley Of The Dolls" and the old "Batman" TV series were camp. "Lost In 
Space" was simply bargain basement kiddie dreck as its very worst. A sci-
fi version of "The Swiss Family Robinson," the show was a painfully dull 
melange of wooden acting, Grade Z special effects, and costumes straight 
from an elementary school play. The only element of the show even 
remotely interesting was the bitchy relationship between the family's 
robot and the villainous Dr. Smith, played by Jonathan Harris as a grumpy,
 grandiose old queen.
30 years after the series died and went to rerun Hell, "Lost In Space" 
has been reborn as a feature film, with a budget in the neighborhood of 
$80 million. Who would have ever thought? Even more surprising is the 
fact that, for the most part, they finally got it right. This "Lost In 
Space" is a whiz bang, tongue-in-cheek space opera, entertaining and 
visually imaginative. Although the story lurches across more than a few 
rough spots, overall it's a pretty fun ride.
The movie follows the basic premise of the TV series. Faced with looming 
ecological disaster, the United Global Space Force is looking for a new 
planet. Against his wishes, hotshot fly-boy Major Don West (Matt Le 
Blanc) is assigned to pilot the Jupiter 2, taking the Robinson family 
across the galaxy to set up a space gate that will allow instantaneous 
transportation throughout the stars. Enter Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman,
) a mercenary working for sedition interests, who sabotages the mission, 
but inadvertently ends up trapped on the ship with the Robinsons. Big 
splashy adventures follow, as the group deals with a robot gone berserk, 
intergalactic spiders, a space monkey, and an encounter with a time 
bubble, where they come face to face with future versions of themselves.
William Hurt plays Professor Robinson much like his character in "Altered 
States"; both are chronically preoccupied scientists who care for their 
families, but don't take time to show it. Maureen Robinson (Mimi Rogers 
from "Austin Powers") tries to bridge the emotional gap between Dad and 
the kids; Will (Jack Johnson,) Penny (Lacey Chabert,) and Judy (Heather 
Graham from "Boogie Nights.") The cast is fine, except for "Party Of 
Five's" annoying young Lacey Chabert, who looks like a midget Neve 
Campbell and talks like Alvin the Chipmuck. 
Thankfully, Gary Oldman, in his umpteenth role as a villain, keeps his 
portrayal of Dr. Smith in check. He captures the spirit of Harris, 
spouting lines like "Farewell, my platinum plated pal. Give my regards to 
oblivion," without approaching the hamminess ozone of his predecessor. 
Matt Le Blanc from "Friends" is likable as Major West, the Jupiter 2's 
version of Han Solo. Watch for cameos from June Lockhart (as a 
holographic note from school) and Mark Goddard (Major West's superior 
officer) from the original series. Incidentally, Bill Mumy, the original 
Will Robinson, was inexplicably passed over for a part, while Jonathan 
Harris refused to appear ("I don't do bit parts," he sniffed.)
Of course, "Lost In Space" is about special effects, not acting, and the 
results are mixed. The film boasts over 700 computer-generated visual 
effects, a new record, and many of them are knockouts. After some 
expansive shots of a futuristic city (not as good as "The Fifth Element," 
but still quite nifty,) we're treated with a dazzling launch sequence as 
the Jupiter 2 takes flight. Unfortunately, once the family hits space, 
the effects become more uneven. CGI close-ups of a cryogenic procedure 
look phony, as do some of the creature shots. 
Most irritating are scenes of the Blawp, a space monkey designed by the 
Jim Henson folks to be "user-friendly, from a merchandising point of view.
" The CGI creature moves well enough (for a walking toy commercial,) but 
the effect is never convincingly integrated into the scenes, looking as 
if it was pasted onto the individual frames of film. 
For its first two thirds, "Lost In Space" moves along at a brisk pace, 
nicely mixing visuals and genre standbys, underscored by the "Afterschool 
Special" subplot about young Will seeking parental validation. Things get 
murkier in the final reel, when the time bubble enters the storyline and 
angst-ridden future versions of the cast chase the family around. 
Naturally, all is resolved in time to set things up for a sequel.
Although undeniably cheesy, "Lost In Space" is done with high style and 
good humor. For cinematic junk food, it's tastier than you'd expect it to 
be. Notwithstanding that damned Blawp, of course. Get me a hunting rifle 
and I'd gladly mount its head on the wall, right next to my Ewok.

Review for When We Were Kings (1996)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Last fall, I had a brief encounter with Muhammad Ali at a political fund 
raiser in Indianapolis. Through dumb luck, I happened to be in the right 
place at the right time and was able to speak to Ali and his wife for a 
few moments. It was thrilling, of course, but I left feeling awful, and 
cried on the way home. The sight of this amazing man, legendary for his 
brilliant physical and verbal skills, left palsied and muzzled by 
Parkinson's syndrome was almost too tragic to watch. Ali has repeatedly 
made it clear that his mind remains sharp and he doesn't want to be 
pitied, but pity him I did. 
Over the months, I came to realize that I was wrong. Muhammad Ali is not 
tragic, he is as valiant as ever. Despite his affliction, he makes 
frequent public appearances for people and causes in which he believes, 
showing the same defiance towards Parkinson's syndrome that he has 
brandished at the many foes he has faced throughout his magnificent 
career. Ali remains an inspiration to all, the consummate hero.
"When We Were Kings," which just won an Oscar for Best Documentary, 
beautifully captures one of the highlights of Ali's career, 1974's 
"Rumble In The Jungle" with George Foreman in Zaire. The fight came 
during a period when Ali was one of America's most controversial figures. 
Having alienated some by joining the Black Muslim movement and dropping 
his birth name, Ali enraged many by refusing induction into the military 
on grounds of conscientious objection. He was dragged through the legal 
system and stripped of his boxing title, all at a time when his skills 
were at their peak. 
Then fight promoter Don King, only three years out of prison for 
manslaughter, organized the "Rumble In The Jungle," giving Ali the chance 
to regain the title from George Foreman. Foreman, now beloved for his 
warmth, rich humor and easygoing manner, was a far different man then. 
Fresh from a ghetto neighborhood in Houston, Foreman was a sullen 25 year 
old, a ferocious warrior who had destroyed Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, 
men who had previously defeated Ali. Foreman was the clear favorite going 
into the match. King promised each fighter $5 million, despite having no 
financing in place. The shady promoter eventually got the money from 
Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruthless, egomaniacal dictator, who viewed the 
fight as a public relations coup for his country and himself. In addition 
to the fight, King organized a three-day black music festival, featuring 
James Brown, B.B. King, the Spinners, Miriam Makeba, and the Crusaders. 
The fight and festival were promoted as a major display of racial pride; 
proud black men and women returning to the motherland to celebrate their 
heritage. 
All of the elements were in place for what proved to be a mesmerizing, 
often surreal, media circus. Leon Gast's documentary captures the event 
brilliantly, mixing the 74 footage with recent interviews from Norman 
Mailer, George Plimpton, Thomas Hauser (Ali's biographer) and Zaire 
artist Malik Bowens. Gast creates a real air of suspense, despite the 
fact that the outcome of the fight is well-known. Through sharp editing, 
he paints a fascinating multi-colored portrait of the event that succeeds 
on many levels. 
Ali's amazing poems and speeches are all there, delivered with a pure 
sense of euphoria. But Gast keeps the camera on Ali after his speeches 
wind down, with telling results. We see Ali groping for words, laughing 
at his own absurdity, and occassionally, you can see the fear and doubt 
in his eyes. 
The details of the event, and the circus surrounding it, are all there. 
Foreman's confusion over Ali receiving all of the attention despite the 
fact that *he* was the champion. The Americans arriving in Zaire dressed 
in traditional African clothing, only to be greeted by Zaireans nattily 
attired in business suits. Bad fashion and great music combine to capture 
a clear sense of 70's culture. Gast also presents the harsh racial and 
political realities of the time, using a light hand that allows the 
audience to consider those issues without onscreen editorializing.
And then, of course, there's the actual fight. Even those who are not 
sports fans will be mesmerized by Ali's brilliant strategy, underscored 
with excellent commentary. The fight is absolutely exhilarating to 
witness.
It took over 20 years of financial and legal battles for Gast to bring 
"When We Were Kings" to the screen, with outstanding results. Beyond 
creating an exceptional documentary, Gast reminds us of the majesty of 
Muhammad Ali, a man who was, and is, a hero for the ages.

In a crowded Christmas marketplace, it would be easy for a little movie 
like "Down in the Delta" to get lost in the shuffle. Hopefully, positive 
reviews and good word-of-mouth will help audiences discover that, despite 
some flaws, this is a film far more deserving of their attention than 
material like "You've Got Mail," "Stepmom" and "Patch Adams." Poet Maya 
Angelou's debut as a feature director is a solid, often moving story 
about family, love, reconciliation and self-determination. "Down in the 
Delta" resolutely avoids the clichés that most productions embrace, 
resulting in one of the only holiday offerings this year that is both 
heartwarming and genuine.
Loretta (Alfre Woodward) is an unemployed single mother in a Chicago 
ghetto who uses alcohol and drugs to mute her pain; neglecting her 
autistic daughter Tracy (Kulani Hassen) and driving her mother, Rosa Lynn 
(Mary Alice), and son, Thomas (Mpho Koaho) to distraction. Desperate to 
jolt her daughter out of self-medicated numbness, Rosa Lynn insists that 
Loretta and the children spend the summer with Uncle Earl (Al Freeman Jr.
) in the family's Mississippi Delta hometown. With great reluctance, 
Loretta boards the bus with the kids, bound for a three month stay in 
Hooterville Hell. 
Initially, things look as bad as Loretta expected. The rural home is in a 
dry county. Earl's beloved wife, Annie (Esther Rolle) suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease and requires constant attention from her husband and 
Zenia (Loretta Devine), a caregiver who views Loretta with suspicion. To 
make matters worse, Loretta must drag herself out of bed early each 
morning to make chicken sausages in Earl's diner.
Things change, of course, but not in typical Hollywood fashion. Loretta 
doesn't find romance in the bucolic setting. There are no melodramatic 
outbursts or hokey speeches and, best of all, Myron Goble's script 
doesn't whip out a terminal illness to tidy things up. Instead, we're 
presented with well-rounded characters and reasonable plot developments 
leading to a conclusion that doesn't feel the least bit contrived. 
Pure and simple, this is a rich story about the power of family, with a 
terrific ensemble cast. Mary Alice is forceful as stubborn matriarch Rosa 
Lynn, young Mpho Koaho gives a remarkably assured performance as Thomas, 
a child mature beyond his years, and the late Esther Rolle, in her final 
film appearance, is heart-breaking as a once-vibrant woman turned into a 
jittery child by Alzheimer's. Wesley Snipes, appearing midway through the 
film as Earl's son, Will, a successful Atlanta lawyer, does fine work, 
adding more texture to an already multi-layered story.
Even though Alfre Woodward is the central figure in the tale, Al Freeman 
Jr. walks away with the film as Earl, a seasoned, sturdy, inherently 
decent man who earns respect by living his values, rather than 
pontificating. Our world would operate much better if everyone had an 
Uncle Earl in their life.
Despite the wealth of vivid characters around her, Alfre Woodward's 
Loretta remains a bit too sketchy and her journey to self-actualization 
is overly abrupt. We see her change, but don't really feel it. The 
addition of a revelatory scene or two would have given her character more 
resonance.
I suspect the problem lies more with Maya Angelou than Woodward. "Down in 
the Delta" was originally intended to be a made-for-cable movie and it 
shows. While the film represents an impressive directorial debut, it is 
clearly a first-time effort. Too many scenes end with slow fades to white 
or black, and flashback sequences of a nightmarish family trauma during 
the Civil War are amateurishly staged and replayed excessively. 
Problem areas aside, "Down in the Delta" is a powerful, rewarding 
experience. It is rare to see a film extol the values of devotion, hard 
work and dedication without becoming leaden or preachy. Hopefully, 
audiences will sift through the heavily-advertised holiday trifles and 
seek out the understated rewards of this small treasure.

NOTE: A feature on Heath Ledger follows this review.
After watching "A Knight's Tale" the first time, I scanned my notes and
saw a laundry list of flaws. The film is sloppy, self-indulgent and
about 20 minutes too long. The story is, to put it kindly, overly
familiar. And jousting, no matter how cleverly shot, is one dull damned
sport. But regardless of all its failings, I liked the movie. The
central characters were endearing and I loved the camaraderie between
them. Last weekend, I attended another advance screening of the film
and, to my surprise, enjoyed it even more the second time around. "A
Knight's Tale" is a mess, but it's my kind of mess.
Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for the "L.A.
Confidential" screenplay, takes the story of a young man pretending to
be a knight and plays fast and loose with the particulars. Although it
is set in the 14th century, the characters talk like 21st century folks.
The Nike logo turns up on a suit of armor. A princess wears a variety of
attractive, but bizarre, outfits that do not fit the time period,
including one number that looks like something Audrey Hepburn wore in
"Breakfast at Tiffany's." As if all that wasn't enough, the orchestral
score is spiced with a number of classic rock songs, from Queen's "We
Will Rock You" to War's "Low Rider." Purists are already howling about
the movie, of course, but who cares? What Helgeland does here is fun.
A side note: One critic accuses the filmmaker of using the rock
chestnuts to "woo the youth market." Pardon me, but does this guy really
think that kids who listen to current pop music are going to embrace a
production because its soundtrack includes "Taking Care of Business" and
"The Boys are Back in Town?" Give me a break. The paying audience at the
sneak I attended Saturday were mostly couples ranging from adult to late
middle age.
The frills in "A Knight's Tale" may be from left field, but the story is
strictly (in fact, overly) traditional. William (Heath Ledger from "The
Patriot") is squire to Sir Ector, a jousting legend who dies at the
beginning of the film. Desperate for money, the young man convinces
fellow squires Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk) to assist him as
he furtively dons the knight's armor to compete in his place. The facade
is successful and William decides to work towards the world
championships, despite the fact that peasants are not allowed to
participate.
Luckily, the boys run into the one and only Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany)
staggering naked down the dirt path. Years away from his Canterbury
days, the unemployed writer and chronic gambler joins them and forges a
fine set of identification papers. William becomes Sir Ulrich von
Lichtenstein of Gelderland, jouster extraordinaire, with Chaucer
providing florid intro speeches that would make a WWF wrestler tear up
with joy. A fiery blacksmith named Kate (Laura Fraser) soon joins the
gang as they head from stadium to stadium, with rapturous crowds
chanting Ulrich's name.
William is enraptured as well, by the beautiful, hauty Jocelyn (Shannyn
Sossamon). While he tries to win the heart of the fair maiden, an enemy
glowers from the sidelines. Sir Adhemar (Rufus Sewell from "Dark City")
detests the young upstart and makes clear his intentions to retain his
jousting title and to snatch Jocelyn while he is at it.
Helgeland brought his cast together in Prague a month before shooting
began to practice jousting and get to know each other. The actors spent
their days rehearsing and their nights drinking. By the end of their
prep time they were thick as thieves and the results show up onscreen.
The relaxed bond between the actors/characters makes the film work, even
when the dialogue is weak. Mark Addy ("The Full Monty") and Alan Tudyk
make a particularly likable team, with Addy bouncing caustic one-liners
off Tudyk's chronic blustering. Paul Bettany is an absolute hoot as
Chaucer, with Laura Fraser's down to earth performance anchoring the
group.
The best segment in the film shows off the talents of the three lead
players. A formal dance begins with harpsichord music and turns into a
joyous contemporary romp set to David Bowie's "Golden Years." Heath
Ledger is dashing and charismatic, with his unforced masculinity filling
the screen. Newcomer Shannyn Sossamon projects erotic elegance as she
puts her dance training to good use. The two serve as a delightful
center to a magical scene. While they strut their stuff, Rufus Sewell
does some remarkably subtle acting. Watch his face as he makes the
transitions from arrogance to anger to confusion to sadness to defeat,
all without a single word.
The playful, frothy moments of "A Knight's Tale" shine, while the latter
part of the film suffers from an attack of mawkishness, finally turning
into a medieval "Rocky."  Brian Helgeland needs more discipline as a
director. At two hours and eight minutes, his movie screams for editing.
I'd have cut some of the jousting scenes, which are numbingly
repetitive. I also would have rewritten the entire third act and
deep-sixed the pathos. But the bottom line is that Helgeland's
incongruous flourishes and top-notch ensemble cast save the film from
its many, many problem areas.
Inside a tin can: Heath Ledger stars in 'A Knight's Tale'
Heath Ledger is a movie star about to happen. Beyond mere good looks, he
has that hard to describe but impossible to miss quality that makes him
a real presence onscreen. Anyone who saw him as the cool outsider in "10
Things I Hate About You" or as Mel Gibson's eldest son in "The Patriot"
understands. And the marketers at Columbia Pictures certainly know. His
new film, "A Knight's Tale," is an adventure/romance set in medieval
times, but instead of displaying images of jousting or swordplay,
posters for the movie simply feature a close-up of the 21-year-old's
face, with the tag line, "He will rock you."
So how does it feel to have a big summer flick riding on your shoulders?
"The thought never enters your mind," said Ledger, nursing a bottle of
water in a Beverly Hills hotel suite, "not while you're making the
movie. I guess afterwards, when you see that [gestures to a reproduction
of the poster], it is daunting. It's slightly intimidating. But I also
know the process, I know the studio's process, how they market movies
and how they're marketing this movie. It's your job and you feel like a
product sometimes, and you are. The movie is a product and I'm a product
of the movie. Their job was to try and create a style as fast as they
could to sell the movie. It can piss you off but it's also out of your
control to a certain degree, so you just have to relax with it."
In person, Heath Ledger seems anything but a hot Hollywood property.
Sitting at the table in casual clothes with mussed up hair, he comes off
as refreshingly average, younger looking than on film and quite
unguarded. Over the years I've talked with a numbing stream of sprayed,
moussed and gelled 20something actors whose every word sounded
programmed. This is a nice change of pace.
Writer/director Brian Helgeland, whose screenplay for "L.A.
Confidential" won an Academy Award, did not have Ledger in mind when he
wrote his story, which playfully mixes elements from other time periods
into its 14th century setting. "The character had to be able to sword
fight and joust and ride and sing and dance," said Helgeland. "And he
had to have a very self-possessed quality. Heath's name came up  he was
shooting "The Patriot" at the time  and I asked 'What's he done?' I
hadn't seen "10 Things" and then they said he starred in the short-lived
TV series "Roar," which was kind of a cheesy "Xena" type adventure show.
I had seen it a couple of times, just switching channels, and I
remembered him from that. I remember thinking 'What an awful show, but
he was really good, whoever this guy is.'"
A meeting was set up at LAX, as Ledger was preparing to fly home to
Australia. The two chatted for a bit, with Ledger saying he liked the
script, then Helgeland asked about the long tube the actor had at his
side. It was a didjeridoo, the droning instrument popularized
domestically as part of the theme song and score for "Survivor: The
Australian Outback." Ledger hauled it out and played it for the
filmmaker, who was delighted. "I liked him and I thought 'Who else could
it be but this guy?'" Helgeland explained. "I got him to agree to play
it in the movie. He went off and we made a deal."
But when filming began, Ledger stalled every time the didjeridoo was
mentioned. During the last week of shooting, Helgeland pressed for an
explanation and finally got one. "He told me he'd been thinking about it
and said, 'I don't want to play it. It's an Aboriginal instrument and
I'm afraid that if it appears in a medieval movie people will think it's
a European instrument.' This hadn't crossed my mind at all. I don't know
how to articulate it, I just thought 'This is not your average
21-year-old.' He has a chance to impress everybody, but instead he
thought about it that thoroughly. It was, well, it was a beautiful
thing." Asked about the incident, Ledger, who has played the instrument
for six years, said it was a simple matter of respect for the Aboriginal
people.
Ledger was as attracted to the story as Helgeland was to him. "It was
like, c'mon, I couldn't believe it. It was a smorgasbord of everything.
It was funny and sad and had all that action  it had a rich heartbeat
that went throughout the movie, which I really loved. And then just
meeting Brian and being on the same page. Sitting down and realizing we
had the same views of the movie. And he was a lovely, lovely guy. I just
wanted to work with him."
Before shooting started, the cast, which includes veteran performers
like "The Full Monty's" Mark Addy and newcomers like Shannyn Sossamon,
assembled at the location site in Prague for a month of rehearsals. The
cast dutifully practiced during the day, but spent most of their
evenings consuming a great deal of alcohol. "There was about three weeks
of drinking," said Ledger with a rakish grin. "The rest of the time was
horse riding and punching and swordplay; that sort of thing. Between the
work and the drinking, we bonded as a group. I think all the fun and the
friendship translates to the finished film."
For Ledger, the camaraderie was the best part of the experience and
wearing a suit of armor the worst. "You feel like the inside of a tin
can. It's very hot and very heavy. And it was kind of painful because
when you're riding a horse the armor bounces up and down on you." He
enjoyed his steed, though. "My horse Barney was so well trained. You
walk him over and show him the mark, then you go back and, when the time
comes, he goes right to it."
Unlike many young actors, Ledger avoided getting caught in teen movie
hell. After doing just one high school romantic comedy, he moved to a
pivotal supporting role in the prestigious Mel Gibson production and
then on to a starring role of his own. He claims not to have a formal
career plan, but agrees that he is selective. "My plan then was not to
make another teen movie, not to get caught in that. It's very easy, I
think, to fall into that trap. But I have to be selective. I'm stubborn
like that. I'm not happy unless I'm doing something I genuinely like.
That's reflected in the roles I pick. And I have to be scared; I have to
be worried going into it. I don't like it to be too easy. It has to test
you. I like to set hurtles in front of myself. That keeps it exciting."
His next film is another historical piece, "Four Feathers," where he
stars opposite Kate Hudson and Wes Bentley. Ledger has an affinity for
period movies, stating, "I guess the thing that interests me is the
characters from a hundred, 200 years ago. Emotions have evolved since
then, as well as the way we communicate, so you really have to go back
and get an understanding of where we came from and how we got to this
place now. It's curious  sometimes there's a fine line between our job
and being a shrink. Because you have to get in there and dig."
Ledger scoffed at a story referring to him as an old soul in a young
body.
"I'm a kid," he laughed, "I'm a total kid. I mean, you have to wizen up
a little bit professionally. I have to come in here and talk about
myself and go on about the movie, but inside I'm a 6-year old kid. In
some way that will never change and I think that's important. You have
to hold onto that."

Don't be misled by its title. "The Art of War" sounds intriguing, but
the actual film is just another glossy B-movie thriller, the kind of
forgettable action fare that turns up at odd hours on TV with titles
like "Strike Force," "Terminal Impact," or "Deadly Velocity." Besides
Wesley Snipes' charisma, the most interesting facet of this production
is its peculiar outlook on the capacities of the human body.
During most of "The Art of War," gravity is, at best, an inconvenience.
When chased by an opponent, characters routinely leap off the top of
tall buildings, plummeting hundreds of feet only to emerge unscathed.
Apparently, the trick is to use glass ceilings of adjacent structures to
break your fall. In the absence of a glass roof, simply tuck and roll
just before hitting the concrete far below. And don't worry about broken
glass. Although it makes a great sound while shattering, it will not cut
you.
Important safety tip: These rules apply only until the climactic battle
scene. During the-fight-to-end-all-fights, a 10-foot-fall will knock the
combatants into a stupor and a shard of glass can prove deadly (but only
to a bad guy).
Originally intended as a Jet Li vehicle, the story begins in Hong Kong
at a lavish party on December 31, 1999 (I wonder how long this lil' epic
sat on the shelf). China is finally ready to sign a trade treaty, with
United Nations Ambassador Wu (James Hong) and his assistant David Chan
(Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) working closely with U.N. Secretary General
Thomas (Donald Sutherland) on the historic agreement.
Meanwhile, a group of dead Chinese refugees are discovered packed away
at the New York harbor by wheezy Agent Cappella (Maury Chaykin).
Cut to the U.N., where Wu is assassinated while delivering his key
speech. FBI Agent Neil Shaw (Snipes) leaps into action, chasing the
killer off several rooftops. It turns out that there is an elaborate
scheme to block the treaty, one that soon draws in Shaw, his
wisecracking partner Bly (Michael Biehn), their boss, Eleanor Hook (Anne
Archer) and U.N. translator Julia (Marie Matiko).
Readers concerned about plot descriptions that give away the ending of a
film have nothing to fear in this review. The convoluted storyline is so
confusing that I couldn't explain all the twists and turns even if I
wanted to. Basically, Agent Shaw spends 117 minutes chasing bad guys or
being chased by both good and bad guys, pausing only long enough to drag
poor Julia into the fray.
Director Christian Duguay seems far more concerned with style than
substance, devoting most of his attention to fights, flights and
gadgets. In fact, a way-cool palm sized computer gets almost as much
screen time as Snipes.
After roughly an hour of struggling to keep up with the plot, I
surrendered and simply tried to enjoy the excesses of the production. On
a guilty pleasure level, there are moments to savor.
Like the scene where Agent Cappella states, "So our boy gets rescued by
the Triad, pops one in the melon and turns the rest into Chinese salsa."
Who says that quality film writing is dead?
Or the early segment where Agent Shaw parachutes off the top of a
skyscraper. A bad guy leans over the edge and uses a machine gun to cut
the chute in half right down the middle, forcing Shaw to make one of his
dazzling tuck and roll landings. Now, to split a parachute in half from
above, the bullets must be aimed directly at the top of Shaw's head, but
somehow, he manages to land without a scratch. I guess top-notch FBI
agents come equipped with bulletproof hair.
Despite the tsunami of illogic, Wesley Snipes plays it straight and the
talented actor projects an appealing James Bond vibe. Several supporting
players also show some flair, although the overloaded screenplay allows
scant time for any of them to shine.
Compared to most of the utter dreck released this August, "The Art of
War" was easy to sit through. Remember, though, that due to my job, I
don't have to pay to see this stuff. For those who must shell out
hard-earned cash for movies, I suspect the minor pleasures of this one
will be best enjoyed on a TV screen at home, where it should turn up in
three to four months tops. In the meantime, stick with films like "The
Matrix," where invulnerable heroes making gravity-defying leaps remain
in a fantasy world more appropriate to their superhuman skills.

On a Wednesday afternoon in 1977, I casually decided to catch an 
opening day matinee of "Star Wars." I knew nothing about the movie. 
Aside from a large, nondescript ad in the Sunday paper, there was no 
local hype for the film. The last sci-fi picture to play Indianapolis,
 "Logan's Run," proved quite a disappointment, so my expectations for 
this new offering were nil. At the uncrowded theater (the frenzy 
would not hit until the weekend), I entered with an open mind and 
emerged with an ear-to-ear grin on my face. 
22 years later, I tried to attend a critics' screening of "Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" with a similar frame of mind. To 
hell with the hype, to hell with analytical viewing, and to hell with 
the plot, for that matter. I would just sit back and let the movie 
wash over me. When I left the theater 131 minutes later, my grin was 
far less broad than in my youth, but it was still a treat to revisit 
George Lucas' universe. 
"The Phantom Menace" is a feast for the eyes and ears. The images of 
exotic cities on distant worlds are spectacular and the myriad alien 
species wildly imaginative. John Williams' rich, sweeping score 
enhances every aspect of the production, from the action scenes to 
the quiet moments. Lucas offers larger than life characters and a 
mythic storyline tempered to a degree by comic relief. But despite 
the presence of so many of the right elements, the production leaves 
an oddly distant feel, because Lucas forgot the all important Han 
Solo factor.
This film desperately needs a wisecracking swashbuckler, someone for 
viewers to identify with so we can vicariously experience the story 
rather than simply observe it. In Episodes Four, Five and Six, Han 
Solo fit the bill perfectly, always ready with a caustic remark, a 
glib aside and open expressions of anger, fear and, occasionally, 
heartfelt sentiment. He humanized the proceedings in a way that no 
character does here. 
In "The Phantom Menace," the primary players are a boy, two Jedi 
knights and a Queen. The Jedi Master and his apprentice project the 
inner serenity appropriate for disciples of the Force. The Queen, due 
to her station in life, must maintain an air of dignity and the child 
mostly remains in awe of the incredible goings-on around him. As a 
result, we witness a grand adventure enacted with far too much 
restraint and reserve. To truly engage us, we need at least one full-
fledged adventurer. Instead, we must make due with a kid surrounded 
by royalty and Mennonites. The actors are all fine, but Lucas plops 
them into a stifling stylistic box.
Comic relief is provided by Jar Jar Binks, a computer-animated 
sidekick who speaks in a fractured fashion reminiscent of Jamaican 
patois and falls down a lot. Initially, Jar Jar is phenomenally 
annoying, but he grew on me as the film progressed and, towards the 
end, was almost likable. Other humorous touches include a two-headed 
sports announcer who provides lively commentary during a high-speed 
race, and Ewan McGregor's hair. The Jedi apprentice sports a close-
cropped 'do with a long rattail, the kind of style that was popular 
in the '80s and now is worn only by the young sons of aging rednecks. 
McGregor's hair serves as a reminder that the story is indeed set "a 
long time ago in a galaxy far, far away." Later scenes feature a vast 
army of battle 'droids whose bowling-pin heads suspiciously resemble 
that of Crow, the wiseacre robot from "Mystery Science Theater 3000." 
Coincidence? Perhaps, but I suspect their appearance is a sly homage 
from Lucas.  
Although set decades before "Star Wars: A New Hope," several 
treasured characters from the initial trilogy appear in "The Phantom 
Menace." The ever-cranky Yoda pops up, as does plucky little R2-D2 
and a not-yet-finished version of C-3PO, history's first gay robot. 
As a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ewan McGregor adds a nice touch of 
continuity by echoing Alec Guinness' vocal cadences. 
But, for better or worse, personalities are the least of "Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace." The main pleasures of the film come 
with the spectacle of it all; from a wild flight past a magnificent 
underwater city to a razzle-dazzle pod race that is half "Ben-Hur," 
half Indy 500. While "The Phantom Menace" is emotionally remote, it 
is also unquestionably sumptuous. This installment of George Lucas' 
self-described "Saturday afternoon serial for children" may not be 
the best in the series, but it certainly has its share of rewards. To 
enjoy the production, do your best to forget all the hype and just 
let the movie wash over you.

Talk about ironic titles! Although the phrase "Return To Paradise" 
conjures up images of a tropical romance, the film is actually an intense,
 harrowing drama focusing on friendship, sacrifice, ethics and personal 
responsibility. Director Joseph Ruben has crafted a riveting morality 
play you won't soon forget.
It begins in Malaysia, where three buddies are wrapping up a hedonistic 
vacation. Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) head for home, 
while their pal Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) stays behind to pursue his work 
with animals.
Cut to two years later, when Beth (Anne Heche) visits Sheriff and Tony in 
New York. Introducing herself as Lewis' attorney, she lays out the 
nightmarish scenario. Minutes after the men departed, police raided their 
cabin and found enough hash to convict Lewis of possession with intent to 
sell, an offense punishable by death. 
Beth wants the men to go back and accept responsibility for their share 
of the stash. If they do, the charges will be reduced to simple 
possession and Lewis will eventually be freed. If both men confess, 
they'll receive three years each. If only one confesses, he'll be jailed 
for six years. And if they both refuse, Lewis will be led to the gallows 
and hung. His execution date is a mere eight days away. 
What would you do? Would you save the life of your friend by voluntarily 
subjecting yourself to a sentence in a hellish third-world prison? Or 
would simply say no and go about your business, with the burden of his 
death on your shoulders for the rest of your life?
There isn't a simple solution and thankfully, the story doesn't opt for 
easy answers. Based on the 1989 French film "Force Majeure," "Return To 
Paradise" keeps its focus on the gut-wrenching situation. Although the 
screenplay occasionally becomes sluggish during the New York scenes, 
director Joseph Ruben never lessens the intense feel. By the time the 
film reached its unexpected climax, I was left emotionally drained.
While all of the performances are strong, Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche 
deserve special mention. Vaughn, who became a star with his electrifying 
turn in "Swingers," gives depth to Sheriff, a likable young man 
accustomed to going through life on cruise control, always ready for a 
quick exit when things get dicey. Vaughn makes the callow youth's crisis 
of conscience seem credible. 
Anne Heche gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the desperate and 
determined Beth, whose character starts off strong and becomes even more 
engrossing as the movie goes along. Over the last couple of years, Heche 
has made an impact that handily overshadows her high-profile personal 
life. From her engagingly loopy cameo in "I Know What You Did Last 
Summer" to her delicate comic work as the romantic lead in "Six Days 
Seven Nights," Heche has proven herself one of the most versatile and 
talented actors working today.
"Return To Paradise" could easily have turned into "Midnight Express Jr.,
" but the writers have more integrity than that. Just when you're ready 
to dismiss the Malaysians as ruthless barbarians, one of their judges 
delivers a blistering indictment of the United States approach to social 
problems that is jarring because it contains so much truth. 
Likewise, the American media takes some heavy shots, as their bullying, 
morally superior stance towards the policies of foreign nations 
exacerbates an already horrible situation.
Despite the slow spots and periodic lapses into melodrama, "Return To 
Paradise" succeeds because it makes us squirm. Long after leaving the 
theater, the film's central question stays with me. What would I do in 
that situation? I still don't know the answer.

Since the September 11 atrocities, entertainment writers have speculated
on what sort of film would be embraced by post attack audiences. I won't
presume to speak for others, but I can tell you that "Serendipity" did
it for me. The frothy romantic comedy showcases the magic of New York
City, from the bustle at Bloomingdales a few days before Christmas to
the charm of skaters outside Rockefeller Center, gliding like music box
dancers through the snowy night sky.
Reflecting on those scenes, a colleague of mine sighed and said, "Do you
think New York will ever be that way again?" Of course it will. In fact,
it will be that way this Christmas. To think otherwise is to
underestimate the amazing resilience of the people who live and work in
NYC.
A few months ago I would have criticized "Serendipity" for being
pedestrian and predictable, but these are frightening, uncertain times
and there is something soothing about watching a movie and knowing
exactly what is going to happen. Maybe that's why small children watch
the same video over and over and over again.
The story begins "a few years ago," when Jonathan Tragar (John Cusack)
and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) meet while Christmas shopping in New
York (Eugene Levy contributes a brief, entertaining performance as an
anal-retentive salesclerk). Despite the fact that each is involved with
another, the attraction between the two is powerful and they enjoy an
enchanted afternoon and evening together.
Jonathan wants Sara's full name and phone number, but she believes in
fate and he reluctantly agrees with her plan to put destiny to the test.
He writes his name and number on a $5 bill, while she writes hers inside
a copy of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera" (a
novel about a man who waits 50 years to unite with his love). Both the
money and the book will be put back into circulation  if Jonathan and
Sara are meant to be together, fate will guide the novel or the currency
to the proper hand.
Cut to "a few years from now." Sara has moved to San Francisco, while
Jonathan remains in New York. They are both about to be married: Sara to
a musician named Lars (John Corbett) and Jonathan to Halley (Bridget
Moynahan), a New Age shopkeeper who is skeptical of her own merchandise.
As the day of the nuptials draws near, they each remember that fairy
tale evening together and wonder if destiny has forgotten them.
We know the answer, of course (if you don't, then I'd like to welcome
you to the secular world and urge you to keep in contact with your
relatives in Amish country  oh, and please do not read the next few
paragraphs). With this sort of cookie cutter romance, the author has
only two chores: to come up with clever ways for the couple to almost
bump into each other, and to figure out how to separate them from their
fiancées while keeping their characters sympathetic.
Screenwriter Marc Klein engineers a suitable number of near misses,
while keeping each party occupied by his or her best friend. And so Sara
confides with Eve (Molly Shannon) while Jonathan frets with Dean (Jeremy
Piven). Shannon makes a serviceable enough confidante, although she too
often falls back on physical traits of her various "Saturday Night Live"
personas. The pairing of Cusack and Piven works better; the men have
been friends in real life since childhood and their affectionate rapport
shows up onscreen.
As for the fiancés, each is given one mildly annoying behavior to
justify being dumped. Lars is presented as self-absorbed and Halley
comes off as a bit cranky. When the film reaches its inevitable climax,
both breakups occur off camera. Note to the ex-Amish: It's safe to begin
reading again.
In the roles of Jonathan and Sara, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale
establish a nice chemistry. I would have preferred to see more of the
two of them together interacting and less of the standard-issue plot
mechanics, but that, of course, is not the nature of this beast.
"Serendipity" is designed to be an old-fashioned romance and it never
challenges the constraints of its format.
When I look back at this review in a year or two, I may curse myself for
recommending a piece of cotton candy like "Serendipity." But right now,
as the images of crashing planes, collapsing buildings and thousands of
shattered lives still roll through my head, I relish sitting back in my
seat in a darkened theater and watching unfailingly loyal best friends,
glittering New York streets and the steady hand of destiny making sure
that true love will find a way.

Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Michael 
Wincott, Dan Hedaya. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
** and one half (out of ***** stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

Handed the reigns of the moribund "Alien" franchise, French director Jean-
Pierre Jeunet ("City Of Lost Children") faced the daunting task of 
breathing life into a horror series that virtually died in its last 
installment. The pallid "Alien 3" climaxed with Ellen Ripleys swan dive 
into an ocean of fire, a sacrifice to protect humanity from the alien 
growing within her own body. With the heroine fried and most fans of the 
series either angered or bored, whats left to do? Raise the dead, of 
course, and thats just what Jeunet and writer Joss Whedon have done, 
with some intriguing side trips along the way. 
"Alien: Resurrection" contains the requisite extended chase scenes, but 
thats the least interesting part of the movie. The appeal of the film 
lies in the fringes, as Jeunet employs grotesque visions and kinky sexual 
imagery to flirt with some intriguing notions, including what exactly 
constitutes the very nature of identity. While too cold and formulaic to 
fully satisfy, "Resurrection" has enough darkly rewarding moments to 
warrant a visit.
A little history for those who missed the first three films. The aliens 
are incredibly vicious predators with acid literally coursing through 
their veins. An alien grows by emerging from a pod and springing onto the 
face of an unwitting host, then shooting its seed down the gullet of the 
victim. After an incubation period, it bursts through the hosts chest 
and scurries off to finish the growth process. Rumor has it that 
telemarketers are bred the same way.
The film begins with the quasi-resurrection of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney 
Weaver), depicted in a series of stylish fade-ins. On a military 
spaceship 200 years after the last film, scientists clone Ripley in order 
to retrieve the alien queen from her body. Proving that government 
stupidity is timeless, the boys in charge plan to raise a herd of the 
hyper-violent creatures, taming and training them for some unexplained 
evil purpose. Following the surgical extraction of the queen, Ripley 8 
(the first seven clone attempts were nightmarish failures) is kept alive 
for curiosity value alone. A disdainful officer spares her life, while 
declaring "As far as Im concerned, Number 8 is just a meat by-product." 
Ripley 8 grows, and we learn that, due to the alien DNA used in the 
cloning process, she isnt entirely human. Thanks to the racial memory of 
the aliens, the clone retains the memories of the original Ripley, but 
her strange smile, reptilian movements and acidic blood make it clear 
that she is something very, very different.
Enter the Betty, a commercial freighter crewed by mercenaries. Theyve 
hijacked the cryogenically-frozen bodies of a group of miners, to sell 
them as hosts for the first batch of aliens. However, one of the 
mercenaries, junior mechanic Call (Winona Ryder,) has a decidedly 
different agenda.
In short order, all hell breaks loose as the mercenaries take over the 
ship and the aliens get loose, forcing the soldiers, Call and Ripley 8 
into an uneasy alliance.
"Resurrections" action sequences move along well enough, particularly an 
underwater chase scene, but the characters are too disposable to be 
engaging on an emotional level. The blue-collar crew of the Betty is an 
unpleasant lot, sketchy stereotypes mostly, and its hard to look at them 
as much more than Alien Chow.
Thankfully, Sigourney Weavers enigmatic Ripley 8 is a fascinating 
creation. She clearly remembers who she was, but what exactly is she now? 
Did Ripleys soul make the jump to this new body, or is Ripley 8 just a 
Xerox, an alien hybrid with stolen memories? Weaver and Jeunet work well 
together, examining the whole notion of individual identity through this 
unique creature. Weaver gets to deliver a number of deadpan one-liners as 
well, adding a welcome touch of humor while maintaining the cryptic 
nature of the character.
Throughout the film, Jeunet toys with the freaky sexuality that has 
always been an undercurrent of the series. A scientist holds his lips 
close to an aliens face, separated only by protective glass, in one of 
the more obvious moments of perverse sensuality. A shrink would have a 
field day with the whole notion of face-hugging alien breeders, and 
Jeunet knows the real horror story lies there.  Unfortunately, instead of 
pursuing that truly disturbing line, he returns to the tired chase format 
and, despite the inventive set pieces and rich Gothic-industrial art 
direction, weve seen this stuff too many times before. The horror of 
"Alien: Resurrection" doesnt come from the idea of monsters chasing us. 
It comes from the exploration of why we want them to.

"America's Sweethearts" has an intriguing premise and a great cast, but
it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be. Almost all the
problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer Billy
Crystal, who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that
he typically displays while co-hosting "Comic Relief" charity shows with
Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg (two other paragons of
self-indulgence).
Crystal ignores a simple, but crucial, rule: For a screwball comedy to
work, the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting, because
only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous.
"America's Sweethearts" takes place at a press junket, where decorum
must be maintained in front of the reporters. It's a promising set-up,
but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules, thus dissipating the
tension of the situation. By the end of the film, all the lead
performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists
looking on, but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the
structure has been destroyed.
John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones play Eddie Thomas and Gwen
Harrison, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when Gwen
began seeing Hector (Hank Azaria), a Spanish actor with an ego almost as
pronounced as his lisp. Of the last nine films Eddie and Gwen made
together, six crossed the $100 million mark, but the prospects for their
final effort, a space opus titled "Time Over Time," are far from rosy.
While Eddie has spent many months in a New Age rest clinic fretting over
the breakup, Gwen's solo films have tanked. To make matter worse, the
director of the movie (Christopher Walken), a "visionary" who purchased
the Unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard, is withholding
the film from the studio, insisting that the first screening be held at
the junket.
Desperate to win over the press, the studio elects to hire Lee (Billy
Crystal), a recently fired publicist, to salvage the situation. Lee
hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing Eddie and Gwen to
pretend to be on the road to reconciliation. He enlists the help of Kiki
(Julia Roberts), Gwen's sister, personal assistant and whipping girl.
What Lee doesn't know is that Kiki is in love with Eddie, a fact that
could temper her effectiveness.
Press junkets are a haven for control freaks. Studios fly journalists in
from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel, with food and
drink always at hand. Generally, on the evening of their arrival,
writers are bussed to see the featured film, then ferreted straight back
to the hotel. The next day, writers go to the studio suites and assemble
in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews. Every 30 minutes or
so, a producer, director, writer or actor is brought into the room for a
few minutes of questions, with a publicist hovering in the corner to
keep an eye on things. The atmosphere is one of cordial oppression 
writers are free to ask what they want, but understand that if the
studio dislikes a question, they may not be invited to future junkets.
Representatives from TV stations face even more restrictions. They get
roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew, with
the studio filming the exchanges. The "reporters" are notorious for
tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars, but to play it
safe, the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant
occurs.
Placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is
inspired, but the screenplay undermines the conceit. The junket is moved
from the handsome, but highly confining, Four Seasons Hotel to a plush
resort near Las Vegas. For most of the film, the movie stars run around
the sprawling grounds, completely safe from the eyes of the press. When
they do deal with journalists, the "it is imperative that you be on your
best behavior in front of the reporters" premise is de-clawed. Gwen and
Eddie insult each other while the TV cameras roll, they scream at each
other in a restaurant filled with the media and, at the screening of the
movie, everyone connected with the film goes nuts, all without any
repercussions.
Lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts; in fact,
he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to
be delivered to the tabloids. Is the studio angry about his handling of
the combative actors? Hell no  they feel Lee is a genius for garnering
so much publicity for the movie.
All of which underscores how Billy Crystal and co-writer Peter Tolan
screwed up their own premise: The comedy in "America's Sweethearts" is
based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the
presence of reporters, except that it doesn't matter because any
publicity is good publicity. And thus the very set-up for the film
implodes, leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter.
So what about the cast? Julia Roberts, at her best playing the underdog,
is utterly charming here, although I could have lived without flashbacks
that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit (and not a very
convincing one, by the way). Catherine Zeta-Jones makes a believable
brat and John Cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make
him vaguely sympathetic. By casting himself as the publicist, Billy
Crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "Comic
Relief"- stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball
jokes and snarky remarks.
In supporting roles, Hank Azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad
gestures and a Spanish accent that Speedy Gonzales would have deemed
"too broad." Seth Green is amusing as a toadie, Stanley Tucci is very
good as a ruthless studio head and Christopher Walken plays the
eccentric director with suitable flair, though he has little to work
with.
Come to think of it, "little to work with" is the operative phrase for
this movie. As a Hollywood satire, "America's Sweethearts" is toothless.
As a romance, it is at best a minor pleasure. Such a good cast, such a
waste of their efforts. Had it not been taken long ago, a better title
for the film would have been "Much Ado about Nothing."

We live in an era of personal problems made public, an "Oprah" age where 
people seek attention and absolution by hauling the results of their poor 
decision-making skills in front of the nearest spotlight. Using the media 
as an ersatz confession booth, they pour out the intimate details of 
their obsessions, compulsions and other assorted demons; expecting, and 
generally receiving, forgiving applause following their "daring" displays 
of honesty.  
Once reserved for celebrities, this peculiar form of self-flagellation is 
now available to anyone willing to sacrifice their privacy and dignity in 
exchange for attention. After a local television newsreader was arrested 
for driving while intoxicated, she spoke with the print media and 
received a couple of splashy profiles. In both stories the notion of 
lives endangered by a drunk tooling erratically down the interstate 
became secondary, eclipsed by her sad tale of how family losses, bouts 
with depression and a near-suicidal state of mind led to her brush with 
the law. Cue the string section, flip on the applause sign, and let's all 
pray she stays sober. 
"Permanent Midnight" recounts the true story of Jerry Stahl, a writer who 
routinely earned upwards of $5,000 a week creating scripts for shows like 
"Alf" and "Moonlighting," while spending $6,500 a week on heroin and 
cocaine. He eventually hit bottom, of course. That's what junkies do. 
Told in flashbacks, the film covers his descent to the depths of 
addiction and his work on recovery, culminating in scenes of Stahl 
appearing on various daytime talk shows, baring his soul while promoting 
his tell-all autobiography.
Let's pause and look at Stahl's accomplishments. From his addiction he 
spun a book, lots of television and print exposure, a feature film in 
which he makes a cameo appearance, and more interviews to promote the 
film. Nice work, Jerry! What's next, action figures?
Within this massive exercise in self-exploitation lies a solid, if 
unexceptional, movie. "Permanent Midnight" offers nothing we haven't seen 
before, but as far as harrowing portrayals of junkies go, this one is 
unflinching and well-acted. Ben Stiller gives a strong performance as 
Stahl, making heroin addiction look as ghastly as we already knew it was. 
The film shows entertainment industry types willing to make allowances 
for Stahl's outrageous behavior, as long as he kept cranking out material.
 The scenes are interesting, but certainly not surprising. 
Stahl's tale, like most calculated tell-all's, remains firmly focused on 
him. As with the aforementioned newsreader, the effects of Stahl's 
behavior on others is far less important than his pain, his loss of 
esteem, his shame. You see, in "Oprah-land," the confessor is the star, 
always remaining the center figure in their real-life soap opera; with 
everyone around them fretting over the confessor's tragic self-
destructive behavior. Stahl's horrible actions are presented graphically 
because audiences require that. After all, what good is a public 
confession without juicy details about personal degradation? 
Aside from Ben Stiller's acting, the only thing that really stands out 
about "Permanent Midnight" is the sheer callousness behind its creation. 
Adding even more irony to the cynical proceedings is the appearance of 
"NewsRadio's" Andy Dick as a junkie discussing his habit alongside Stahl 
during the talk show montage that closes the film. In real life, Dick is 
almost as well known for his struggles with substance abuse as he is for 
his comedic skills. The spectacle of a real Hollywood addict playing a 
confessional addict onscreen is borderline surreal and unquestionably sad.
So what message does "Permanent Midnight" send? It's an anti-drug film, 
to be sure, but who among us doesn't already know what addiction can do 
to the human soul? Ultimately, I think the film's message is this: if 
you're plagued by personal demons, get yourself a good agent, because 
there's gold in them thar hills.

Before you leave for the theater take a glance at your kitchen sink, 
because that's the only thing that doesn't get thrown into "Armageddon," 
the second of this year's "Uh oh, big rock!" movies. In its quest to 
become the ultimate summer spectacular, this "Dirty Dozen in Outer Space" 
hits the audience with two and a half hours of virtually non-stop action, 
punctuated with wisecracks and showcasing every cliché in the history of 
movies. "Armageddon" is the kind of blockbuster that leaves you feeling 
exhausted and entertained, though you may have trouble respecting 
yourself the next morning.   
As far as junk food movies go, "Armageddon" is a super-sized value meal, 
with just as little nutritional value. Please understand, I had fun 
during the movie. The special effects were killer, the action scenes 
gripping and most of the jokes were funny. Shucks, I even teared up at 
the appropriate moments. But later, while reflecting on the stock 
characters, contrived situations, and the film's ultra manipulative 
nature, I grew annoyed. Event movies don't have to just be testosterone 
drenched hooey. Without wasting a lot of space pontificating, I suggest 
you look back at "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Then 
consider the recent "Independence Day" and "Godzilla." Are we truly 
doomed to a future where you can't enjoy a summer blockbuster without 
first disconnecting your brain? 
Like "Deep Impact," "Armageddon" deals with a "global killer" headed 
straight for Earth. As in "Deep Impact," the big plan is to land on the 
asteroid, drill deep into the rock and blow the thing to kingdom come 
before it can do the same to us. To that end, NASA recruits a group of 
rowdy oil riggers, lead by Bruce Willis. His team includes the requisite 
archetypes: cocky stud Ben Affleck, wise-guy Steve Buscemi, repentant 
father Will Patton and righteous dude Owen Wilson, plus a whacked-out 
muscleman and a goofy fat guy. Adding spice and romance to the mix is Liv 
Tyler as Willis' spunky daughter and Affleck's honey bunny. 
After a high octane opening, where a dazzling meteor shower rips up New 
York (and the filmmakers get in a funny dig at "Godzilla"), NASA honcho 
Billy Bob Thornton rounds up Bruce's roughnecks to undergo abbreviated 
astronaut training. Before you can say "they're ripping off 'The Right 
Stuff,'" the guys are ready to go. But prior to leaving to save humanity, 
the crew gets a night off, so that each character can underline his one 
distinguishing characteristic, while Ben and Liv share an MTV video 
moment, making out against the sunset during a drippy Aerosmith power 
ballad. 
Then, after a patriotic speech and a shot straight out of "Top Gun" 
showing the uniformed crew walking stoically in slow motion, it's off to 
the shuttles, for a marathon session of derring-do and heroic sacrifice 
in asteroid land. Things go from bad to worse, of course, allowing Bruce 
to get on the mike and say, "Houston, YOU'VE got a problem."
On paper, the derivative and downright cheesy nature of the production is 
obvious, but it's easy to get caught up in it all during the film, thanks 
to breakneck pacing and hyperactive editing. Veteran video maker Michael 
Bay directs the film like a Mountain Dew commercial on amphetamines. With 
camera cuts every 3-5 seconds, this thing makes "Con Air" look sluggish.
The actors play their roles gamely. Billy Bob Thornton anchors the film 
nicely, while Bruce plays the hero, using an odd, semi-Southern accent 
where he kind of swallows his words. Ben and Liv are okay as Ken and 
Barbie with attitude, and Steve Buscemi breaks the tension just enough 
with well-timed, generally funny wisecracks. Newcomer Owen Wilson steals 
scenes as the only crew member totally enthusiastic about the adventure.
As far as the actual plot mechanics, no cliché is missed, including the 
time-honored "should I cut the blue wire or the red wire" bomb defusing 
scene. Incidentally, if the weatherman ever forecasts meteor showers, 
here's a tip. Just drive to the suburbs, because meteors only hit big 
cities. And if you're stuck in New York, for God's sake, avoid the 
Chrysler building, because that sucker gets nailed every time.
I realize this piece has been unusually snide, so let me stress once more 
that I had a good time watching this film. It was only later that the 
cynicism really crept in. As far as late 90's summer blockbusters go, you 
could do lots worse than "Armageddon." Compared to "Batman and Robin" or 
"Godzilla," this thing is "Citizen Kane." But I miss the days when movies 
were made by artists instead of technicians. If, like me, you enjoy 
"Armageddon" while in the theater but feel cheated later in the evening, 
do yourself a favor. Rent "The Right Stuff" and watch a real movie by 
real artists about real heroes.

After a brief prologue, "Saving Private Ryan" goes straight into the 
battle scene to end all battle scenes, a 24 minute recreation of the D-
Day landing at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. The images are absolutely 
brutal, showing in explicit detail the massacre of countless soldiers as 
the Allied Forces storm the beach. "What the hell do we do now sir?" 
shouts one private, while others strip ammunition and weapons off dying 
comrades. One soldier scoops his severed arm off the sand, staggering on 
in a desperate attempt to keep up with his squad. As young bodies explode 
from enemy fire, the Allied Forces still somehow sweep forward, through 
the noise, confusion, and death all around them. Watching the unspeakable 
carnage, you wonder how any of the soldiers could possibly have survived 
the battle, let alone triumphed. 
That's just the beginning of one of the most powerful, visceral war 
movies ever made. Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is an 
experience that left me shaken and deeply moved. Even though the screen 
is filled with the faces of familiar actors, Spielberg makes it seem real,
 thrusting the viewer right into the center of the nightmarish action. 
Hand-held cameras create a quasi-documentary feel. Occasionally the sound 
fades out and the action shifts into slow motion, giving you the eerie 
sense of sharing the experience of a soldier in shock. The film is 
remarkably effective at creating a horrific "you-are-there" feel.
The brilliant "Apocalypse Now" used war as a vehicle for a surreal 
journey into the depths of insanity. The battlefields of "Platoon" served 
as the landscape for a morality play, with the forces of good and evil 
vying for the soul of a young soldier. "Saving Private Ryan" is about war,
 period. The film stays focused on what war does to the body and soul, as 
the men fight to stay alive, to accomplish their mission, and to somehow 
retain their humanity during a situation that screams for them to just be 
animals. 
Only after the staggering extended battle sequence does Spielberg 
introduce you to the characters and story. Still reeling from Omaha Beach,
 Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is given another assignment. Within days,
 three of the four Ryan brothers have been killed in action. The youngest,
 Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), is alive somewhere behind enemy lines. 
Miller is to take his squad to find and retrieve the soldier. 
The film accompanies the men on their harrowing search, as they 
increasingly question their mission. While they understand the reasoning 
behind the assignment, they also see the cold reality. In order to soften 
the terrible blow for Mother Ryan, the military is putting their eight 
lives at great risk. Is the compassionate gesture worth the potential 
body count?
As they travel, we see the dynamics of the squad. Captain Miller is a 
strong, down-to-earth, but cryptic leader. Even the men closest to him 
don't know what he does for a living in the civilian world. Private 
Reiben (Edward Burns) is an outspoken New Yorker who doesn't hide his 
resentment over the mission. Giovanni Ribisi plays Wade, the empathic, 
skilled medic, while Jeremy Davies is Corporal Upham, a timid young man 
"drafted" to replace the squad's slain interpreter. Having never 
experienced combat first-hand, Upham is the fish-out-of-water who serves 
as a sort-of representative for the audience.
It's a strong cast. Ribisi, who plays Phoebe's brother on "Friends," 
leaves a lasting impression as the dedicated medic, and Davies is also 
memorable, although the "Going All The Way" actor needs to widen the type 
of roles he plays, lest he find himself forever typecast as a skittish 
introvert. As Private Ryan, Matt Damon nicely fleshes out his character 
despite his relatively limited screen time. And the remarkable Tom Hanks 
delivers yet another outstanding performance, making Captain Miller a man 
instead of an icon. Don't be surprised if he gets another Best Actor 
nomination next spring.
Steven Spielberg films are often heavy-handed, but he displays great 
restraint here. The harrowing war scenes never feel like directoral 
grandstanding, and the sentimental moments are heart-wrenching without 
becoming drippy. Similarly, John Williams' haunting score beautifully 
accents the film, a welcome change after his overly manipulative turn in 
"Amistad." I suspect both men were tempted to lay things on a little 
thicker. Thank goodness they held themselves back from emotionally 
bullying the audience.
A crowning cinematic achievement, "Saving Private Ryan" doesn't 
romanticize or condemn World War II. It is far more effective by 
presenting war with simple, stark honesty. Spielberg told the Los Angeles 
Times that he made the film for the men who survived, as well as those 
who perished. "It is to honor them with the truth and to hopefully teach 
something," he said. "Audiences today go to the movies, and they are 
often thrilled by violence. This is intended to show the other side of 
what violence does to human beings."

Oh, what a debt the cinema owes to lousy father and son relationships. 
Between the films about sons trying to reconcile with Dad, dads trying to 
reconcile with sons, and young men seeking father figures because Dad is 
either dead or just too damn mean, this angst-filled genre has produced a 
number of fine movies, providing welcome vicarious catharsis for tortured 
males the world over.
"Smoke Signals" is the latest addition to the bad Dad genre, enlivened 
with a healthy dose of good humor. Written by Sherman Alexie, from his 
caustic short-story collection "The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in 
Heaven," the film centers on Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-
the-Fire (Evan Adams), two Coeur d'Alene Indians living on an Idaho 
reservation. When word arrives that Victor's father, who deserted his 
wife and son years earlier, has died, the young men head for Phoenix to 
collect his remains.
Though far from friends, Victor and Thomas have shared a connection since 
childhood, when Victor's father Arnold (Gary Farmer) saved the baby 
Thomas from a fire that killed his parents. Victor grew up sullen and 
stoic, while Thomas became the Native American Urkel. Wearing pigtails, 
black-framed glasses and a constant goofy grin, Thomas tells mythic tales 
of his heritage over and over in a peculiar sing-song voice. He irritates 
the hell out of Victor, who grudgingly allows him to come on the journey 
only because Thomas has the travel funds Victor lacks.
With its mismatched-pair-on-a-road-trip structure and estranged father 
and son subtext, "Smoke Signals" covers very familiar turf, but does so 
with style, punctuating the men's trip with illuminating flashbacks to 
their childhoods. The easygoing film has real charm, thanks to winning 
performances and Alexie's eye for character detail.
In the early scenes at the reservation, he establishes an agreeably 
quirky feel, reminiscent of the "Northern Exposure" TV series. The KREZ 
morning deejay greets listeners with "It's a good day to be indigenous" 
before cutting to a man perched on his broken-down truck at a dusty 
intersection, who offers amusing deadpan bulletins like "Big truck just 
went by. Now it's gone" over his cell-phone. Victor and Thomas exchange 
pleasantries with two young women who cruise the reservation driving in 
reverse, apparently the only gear that works on their car. Elaine Miles, 
the enigmatic Marilyn from "Northern Exposure," is one of the women. 
Cynthia Geary, who played Shelly on the show, also pops in later, further 
underscoring the stylistic connection to the series.
Colorful townfolks aside, the heart of the film is the relationship 
between Victor and Thomas, thankfully two very well-rounded and 
intriguing characters. Adam Beach does fine work adding shadings to 
Victor's tortured soul, and Evan Adams is a revelation as the peculiar, 
but extremely engaging Thomas. Just when you're about to write off the 
young man as a hapless loon, he says something quite insightful. And just 
as you begin to respect his off-the-wall wisdom, he blurts out some 
wildly clueless statement. Such a beguiling odd duck.
As the details about Victor's father slowly emerge, things change for 
both men. The revelations and life-lessons in "Smoke Signals" are nothing 
new, but they resonate anyway, because the dialogue rings true and the 
characters are so credible. 
Presented with both the Audience Award and the Filmmakers Trophy at the 
1998 Sundance Film Festival, "Smoke Signals" is a ragged, but disarming 
little film. In a cinematic climate overflowing with character-deficient 
event movies, it's nice to see an unassuming work about actual human 
beings come up a winner for a change.

Review for Hamlet (1996)
Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, Nicholas Farrell, Kate Winslett, Charleton 
Heston, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
The Uber Hamlet has hit the big screen. Kenneth Branagh's four hour 
production of Shakespeare's classic, the first full-text version ever 
filmed, is the King Kong of tragedies. As a play, Hamlet deals with 
everything: murder, passion, politics, betrayal, madness, love, death, 
and the very meaning of existence. Branagh tackles it all with a 
vengeance; he's not only going to illuminate every facet of Shakespeare's 
epic, he's going to do it in such a vigorous, grand fashion that 
contemporary audiences will embrace the often difficult work. His vision 
and chutzpah is boundless and the film virtually bursts with energy. 
There are many magnificent moments in Hamlet, and quite a few painful 
ones.
Filmed in wide screen 70mm, the movie was made on massive sets in London. 
For the exterior shots the handsome Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire stands 
in for Elsinore. Visually, the interior scenes are a feast, brimming with 
rich details and spacious beauty. The outdoor scenes are a mixed bag. 
Some shots, particularly those of advancing troops, have a real sense of 
grandeur. Unfortunately, many scenes are undermined by surprisingly bad 
set dressings (check out the tons of fake snow) and chintzy special 
effects. A nighttime shot early in the film attempts to capture an 
ominous, spooky feel, but the overuse of dry ice, coupled with very 
cheesy shots of the earth cracking open, make the whole scene look more 
like an amateur haunted house.
But enough about the dressings, let's look at the performances. Branagh 
states "This production is cast color-blind, nationality-blind, accent-
blind. I wanted to work with people I had admired for a number of years 
and who I thought would be very good for the parts." Some of his choices 
are inspired. Despite a spiky blond hairdo and look reminiscent of the 
royalty in David Lynch's "Dune," Derek Jacobi is magnificent as Claudius, 
Hamlet's murderous uncle. Jacobi's performance captures the treachery of 
the man, but also his fear, guilt and remorse. Without minimizing the 
evil of Claudius' deeds, Jacobi makes him much more of a human being. 
Nicholas Farrell gives a hearty, utterly credible performance as Horatio, 
and Kate Winslet's turn as Ophelia is both lovely and heartbreaking. 
Charlton Heston is a commanding presence as the Player King, a part often 
minimized in other productions of the play, and Billy Crystal does a 
surprisingly good job as a wry gravedigger. 
Alas, some of the other actors don't fare as well. Julie Christie, as 
Queen Gertrude, is passive, displaying little of the character's depth. 
As the devoted Marcellus, Jack Lemmon delivers his lines in a shaky, 
tentative fashion. He's hard to watch. And Robin Williams, playing the 
boorish Osric, seems cartoonish and wildly out of step.
As Hamlet, Branagh's performance is all over the place. In some scenes, 
notably the "To be or not to be" soliloquy, he is sublime, adding new 
layers to Shakespeare's extraordinary dialogue. But all too often, in his 
zeal to portray Hamlet as a vital, robust man, he leaps about exsessively,
 shouting his lines at breakneck speed in bombastic fashion. In most 
versions of the play, one of the enduring mysteries is whether Hamlet 
simply feigns madness or actually crosses the line into insanity. Not so 
here  Branagh does everything but wink at the audience, leaving little 
doubt about the mentality beneath the Dane's behavior.
During the intermission, which divides the film's 158 minute first 
portion from the 84 minute conclusion, I confessed to my companions that 
much of the archaic dialogue, delivered at lightning fast speed, was 
flying way over my head. My friends laughed and said they both feared 
they were the only people in the theater that felt that way. Despite 
Branagh's noble intentions, the rushed, often hard to understand dialogue 
makes it clear why the play is usually cut. 
The second portion of Hamlet, structurally shaky even in the short form, 
is particularly confusing and inconsistent here, though it does wraps up 
with a spectacular, if stagy, sword fight. Despite its problems, 
Branagh's Hamlet is well worth your time. His reach extends his grasp and 
the film stumbles along the way, but Branagh's audacious vision, coupled 
with Shakespeare's dazzling prose, delivers many substantial rewards.

Review for Fallen (1998)
Fallen (1998)
Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James 
Gandolfini, Elias Koteas. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. 122 minutes.
Rated R, 2 stars (out of five stars)

Anyone up for a nice game of demonic tag? In the supernatural thriller 
"Fallen," the demon Azazel can transfer from body to body by mere touch. 
It happens instantaneously, so quickly that the next party doesn't even 
have time to react. There's a great scene in the film where Detective 
John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) finally realizes the truth about the 
creature when it follows him down a crowded street, transferring from 
body to body with remarkable ease while taunting the terrified officer. 
Director Gregory Hoblit exhibits perfect timing in this nifty scene, his 
camera flowing smoothly from actor to actor as Azazel body-hops. It's 
words and expressions seamlessly transfer from one person to the next, 
and the effect is dazzling and truly creepy. Ah, if only Hoblit could 
have maintained this level of tension for the whole film. 
He didn't, of course, which is why "Fallen" has been released in January, 
a month designated by the studios for dumping those films that couldn't 
cut it during the highly competitive holiday season. It's a shame, 
because "Fallen" had real potential.
The idea is nothing new. The stylish sci-fi thriller "The Hidden" focused 
on a hedonistic alien murderer that moved from one human host to another 
and the central storyline of David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" involved the 
demon BoB, who killed Laura Palmer while inhabiting her father's body. In 
those stories though, the transfer was traumatic, to say the least. The 
ingenious twist of "Fallen" was in making the transfer instantaneous and 
painless. When the demon moves on, the previous host has no memory of 
what just happened, making the procedure all the more insidious. How does 
a detective follow an investigation when the body that did the killing 
may actually be innocent? Unfortunately, "Fallen" only toys with the 
notion, rather than diving in completely.
The story begins as Hobbes attends the execution of his nemesis, serial 
killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in a brief, but electric performance.) 
Hours before his death, Reese requests, and receives a visit from Hobbes. 
In one of the film's best scenes, Reese moves about his cell like an 
animal, grinning maniacally at Hobbes while tossing off lines like "What 
goes around really goes around" between explosive bursts of a language 
not used since Biblical times. In the gas chamber, Reese continues 
grinning, singing "Time Is On My Side" right up until the end. 
Immediately following his demise, the camera moves to a point of view 
shot above the body, providing a hint of things to come.
In short order, Hobbes learns that something very weird is up, as the 
streak of murders begins again. His investigation leads him to 
supernatural notions he cannot begin to accept and to theology student 
Gretta Limano (Embeth Davidtz,) the daughter of an officer who was killed 
by Azazel. 
All the elements for a successful thriller are present in "Fallen," yet 
the film never quite catches fire. A large part of the problem lies in 
Denzel Washington's performance. Washington is a charismatic actor, but 
generally behaves like a Scoutmaster with a broomstick jammed up his ass. 
He is at his best in films such as the charming "The Mighty Quinn," where 
his stiffness was incorporated into the story. Here, his behavior simply 
appears too proper and subdued for the situation. His muted reactions to 
the incredible circumstances around him puts a damper on audience 
reaction as well. 
There's also the matter of Reese. When Hobbes learns the truth about 
Azazel, he surely would realize that, as one of Azazel's host bodies, 
Reese may have actually been just another victim of the demon. It would 
have been nice to see Hobbes give at least a moments thought to the 
notion that he might have sent an innocent man to his death, but it never 
happens.
Instead, the sole focus of the film is the cat and mouse game between the 
demon and the cop, while the supporting cast twiddle their thumbs. John 
Goodman is wasted as Hobbes partner, Donald Sutherland does his usual 
sinister shtick as the commanding officer, and Embeth Davidtz just rushes 
about looking grim. A promising subplot involving Hobbes live-in brother 
and nephew is never explored.
We do, however, get lots of footage of a dreary Philadelphia and an 
annoying voice-over from Denzel Washington that drips with clichés. Now 
don't get me wrong, "Fallen" isn't a terrible film. There's a genuinely 
intriguing idea at play here, and in a few scenes, the premise comes 
alive, showing just how juicy the film might have been. Had the 
filmmakers taken a little more time to think the story through and flesh 
out the supporting cast, "Fallen" could have been a real corker instead 
of just another January throw-away.

Following the release of "Patch Adams" last December and this month's
"Bicentennial Man," it appears that a new holiday tradition has been
established. Here's how it works. Each Christmas season, Robin
Williams unveils a new mawkish comedy/drama. Then, writers like me
race for our word processors, eager to warn filmgoers that the latest
manipulative drivel from the human Care Bear is just as wretched as
its predecessors. The tradition is completed when audiences ignore
writers like me and flock to their neighborhood theaters, helping the
movie make a gazillion dollars. God help us, everyone.
Last year, the gap between reviewers and the general public was so
wide that several articles appeared with titles like "Patch Adams: The
Critics vs. the Audience." Some argued that reviewers were too cynical
and hard-hearted to appreciate the magic of the film. Others stated
that general audiences were too easily taken in by Hollywood
schlock. My favorite article suggested that the medical comedy/drama
received horrible reviews because critics were secretly teaming with
HMOs to try and destroy personalized health care.
As in "Patch Adams," Robin Williams spends a lot of "Bicentennial Man"
trying to win the hearts of leery, emotionally constricted people. As
in "Patch Adams," death features prominently in the movie (nothing
says Christmas to me like a tender euthanasia scene). The big
difference this time is that the filmmakers' attempts at emotional
manipulation are less offensive.  Where "Patch Adams" used young
chemotherapy patients, a rape victim and others as props for Williams'
shtick, "Bicentennial Man" requires the star to cook up his own
pathos.
That's not a problem for Robin Williams. In a screenplay based on a
couple of Isaac Asimov stories, he plays Andrew, a melancholy robot
longing to become human. Apparently, the folks behind this movie never
saw an episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," where Brent Spiner
routinely (and far more credibly) dealt with the same Pinocchio themes
as the android crew member, Data.
Following Andrew's purchase by a wealthy Bay Area family, Williams
spends the first hour of the movie in full robot drag, and the results
are not pretty. To accommodate his middle-age frame, the metallic suit
is awfully thick. While most of the suit is silver, portions are
copper-colored. From a distance, the copper looks like Caucasian
flesh, giving the suit an odd, peek-a-boo appearance. The tacked-on
facial features, particularly the eyebrows, resemble a cross between
Robin Williams and Mr. Potato Head.
Williams' performance during the first half of the film is as
constricted as his outfit. Proper and very deferential ("One wishes
only to serve"), he slowly develops a personality, to the delight of
owner, Sir (Sam Neill, who gives the film's most interesting
performance) and his daughter, Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the
girl who lip-syncs in soft drink commercials). Though other family
members are less entranced, Sir encourages Andrew to further his
personal growth, leading the robot to experiment with humor, which
allows Williams a chance to do some stand-up comedy bits.
The can-I-win-over-the-family first hour is dull and remarkably
inert. Despite periodic shots of futuristic cities and flying cars,
the home segments play merely like a bawdy "Seventh Heaven"
episode. When Andrew finally takes off to explore the world and search
for "others like myself," things only improve slightly. He eventually
meets quirky robotic expert Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), who helps him
in a series of "upgrades." Once Williams finally looks like himself,
he goes into that sad, twinkly mode that drives writers like me
straight up the wall. Eventually, Andrew returns home to woo Little
Miss' granddaughter, Portia (Embeth Davidtz), leading to a sappy "what
does it mean to be human" final act.
If any of this sounds intriguing, trust me, it isn't. Director Chris
Columbus, the man responsible for "Stepmom," another horribly
manipulative touchy-feely movie, tries to make Andrew's quest seem
profound, but in Columbus' heavy hands, all the fuss and bother
remains maddeningly pedestrian. Rather than epic, the second half of
the film is simply dreary and depressing, with the comic moments
seeming contrived at best.
While not as awful as "Patch Adams," "Bicentennial Man" is a dour,
tepid affair masquerading as an inspirational comedy/drama. Of course,
as long as audiences continue to flock to this kind of pabulum,
Williams will continue to crank it out. Robin Williams is a talented
man in danger of becoming a habitual hack. But you can rescue him from
artistic ruin by refusing to shell out money for films like this. Save
Robin Williams! Together, we can stage a mass intervention and break
this nightmarish holiday tradition! Don't go to "Bicentennial Man!"
Oh, who am I kidding? This dog is going to make a fortune.

The gallows comedy, "Drowning Mona," is set in Verplunck, a small town
in New York's Hudson Valley that was once a test market for Yugos. The
national rollout of the chintzy cars proved to be a massive bust, but in
Verplunck, everyone still tools around in the little death traps. The
loser-mobiles are the perfect vehicles for the citizens of this weird
burg. With its motley assortment of backstabbers, cheaters, connivers
and other ne'er-do-wells, the community serves as the Bizarro Mayberry;
a petri dish of colorful yahoos that could provide Jerry Springer enough
guests for a year or two.
Opening day reviews of "Drowning Mona" were overwhelmingly negative,
with most critics slamming virtually every aspect of the movie. Count me
in the minority. While noting various problem areas, I was too busy
laughing to worry about them much. "Drowning Mona" may be a mess, but
it's a funny one.
It begins with the demise of Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), who plunges to
a watery death when the brakes on her Yugo fail to work. Laid-back
police chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) soon learns that the car had been
sabotaged and launches a murder investigation. Narrowing the suspect
list proves a difficult task  Mona was a monster widely hated
throughout the community. In the matter of Mona's murder, any number of
Chief Rash's friends and neighbors had motive enough to whack the
harridan.
While the whodunit fuels the storyline, the real payoff in "Drowning
Mona" comes from studying Verplunk's low wattage luminaries. There's
jittery Phil Dearly (William Fichtner), Mona's battered husband (among
other things, she smacked him in the head with a frying pan) who has
been carrying on an affair with Rona Mace (Jamie Lee Curtis), a sexy
waitress at the local diner. His son Jeff (Marcus Thomas) is another
creepy piece of work. The surly boob lost a hand under mysterious
circumstances (we're shown several possible scenarios for the
mutilation, all involving him reaching for a beer at the wrong moment)
and is widely known for being almost as mean as his mother. While
working as a landscaper, he once mowed down a client's cat  literally.
Jeff's business partner, Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck), was another
frequent recipient of Mona's fury. The blond, blandly polite kid divides
his time between trying to rid himself of Jeff, and working out details
for his upcoming wedding to Chief Rash's daughter, Ellen (Neve
Campbell), a feisty redneck used to getting exactly what she wants.
As far as colorful characters go, I've barely scraped the surface.
There's self-assured auto mechanic Lucinda (Kathleen Wilhoite), freaky
funeral director Cubby (Will Farrell), nosy old coot Clarence (Tracey
Walter, who plays a very similar role in "Erin Brockovich"), Chief
Rash's dumb cluck officers, led by the preening Feege (Peter Dobson) and
many others.
Writer Peter Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez juggle their large cast
well, making it surprisingly easy to remember each player in the
ensemble. Still, several of the more intriguing characters are sketchily
drawn and woefully underused. Steinfeld and Gomez treat "Drowning Mona"
as if it was one episode in a TV series, focusing on a few characters
for this installment while planning to highlight other cast members in
later shows.
The writing is just as uneven. A running gag about lovers using a "Wheel
of Fortune" board game as part of their sex play never takes off, and
the plotline, which reveals the identity of the killer far too early,
loses steam towards the end.
Still, the film is still funny. Beyond the obvious jokes lies an
absurdist sensibility that leads to a number of wonderful off-the-wall
moments. I won't spoil things by recounting them here, but one strong
example occurs when Bobby spots Jeff leering at a young girl and
exclaims "Come on, man, she just turned 13!" Jeff immediately replies,
"Finally!" Tasteless? You bet, but it still left me howling.
The cast has a great time playing the local yokels. Bette Midler gets to
strut her stuff in raucous flashbacks (unfortunately, the filmmakers
include one ill-conceived scene that softens the character, failing to
realize that for Mona to work, she needs to be as vile as humanly
possible). William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas make an effective
father-son pair, Danny DeVito nicely underplays his role and Neve
Campbell whoops it up as a hillbilly debutante. Jamie Lee Curtis,
Kathleen Wilhoite and Will Farrell also make indelible impressions,
despite being given scant screen time.
If you're looking for a comedy with finesse and good manners, "Drowning
Mona" is not for you. But if you simply want to laugh a lot and don't
mind a considerable amount of nastiness, feel free to ignore the
consensus and join me in the critical minority. I welcome the company.

"Videodrome" and "Dead Ringers" director David Cronenberg is really 
getting on my neRvZ. As a follow-up to "Crash," his 1996 endurance test 
about people who get sexually aroused by car wrecks, he offers "eXistenZ,
" a grisly, uninspired tale about virtual reality run amok. Once again, 
Cronenberg operates on the assumption that if you fill the screen with 
enough creepy imagery, people will overlook leaden pacing, flat 
characters and a tired, obvious "question reality" storyline with a final 
"twist" so obvious that it's almost laughable. 
The basic theme of "eXistenZ" was explored more effectively in 1995's 
"Strange Days," and with far less goo. Cronenberg throws so much blood 
and guts into this film that at times I felt like I was watching the 
Surgery Channel on a TV placed in a tank full of bait. I wish he would 
just take a job in a slaughterhouse and get this fetish out of his system 
once and for all. 
Cronenberg also uses another of his favorite attention-getting devices, 
grisly sexual imagery. To play eXistenZ (pronounced EGGs-iz-TENZ), 
participants must have "bio ports" drilled into their lower backs to 
allow an organic cord to plug the "metaflesh game pod" directly into the 
spinal column. In addition to showing us the vaguely phallus-shaped cords 
being plugged into the "bio-ports," we're also treated to a shot of one 
character inserting a finger into a freshly drilled "port" hole and 
another of a character licking one of the openings. Golly (nudge, nudge, 
wink, wink), what could David possibly be alluding to with these images? 
One thing's for sure: I would never let this guy date my sister.
The gore-porn motif might be acceptable were it serving a novel story, 
but after an intriguing beginning, the film goes nowhere, and takes what 
feels like forever to get there. It starts at a test session for eXistenZ.
 Volunteers meet Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), inventor of the 
new virtual reality game, and prepare to try out her creation. Suddenly, 
an audience member leaps forward, shouting revolutionary slogans while 
trying to assassinate Allegra with a gun that looks as if it were 
assembled from Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a 
company lackey and virtual reality virgin, rescues Allegra and the pair 
take flight. Unsure whom to trust, Allegra cuts off contact with everyone 
except Ted, enlisting his help to repair the prototype game pod that was 
damaged in the attack. With great misgivings, Ted agrees to be fitted 
with a "bio port" and the couple sets off on a virtual reality recovery 
mission.
Unfortunately, Cronenberg's virtual worlds are considerably less 
interesting than the real one. Allegra and Ted spend a great portion of 
the film encountering cryptic figures in a trout farm and a Chinese 
restaurant. Everyone chases each other around while brandishing organic 
guns that shoot teeth, Allegra rubs things a lot and bonds with a two-
headed sort-of salamander and, when not fighting or making out, the 
couple wonders whether they've reached reality or just another level of 
the game. Trust me, this description reads more exciting that it plays 
out onscreen.
Although only 97 minutes long, "eXistenZ" plods terribly before stumbling 
to its trite conclusion. Along the way, a great cast is wasted. Wonderful 
actors like Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Sarah Polley are given throwaway 
parts and Jude Law is saddled with a terminally bland role. Remember the 
moment in "The Matrix" when Keanu Reeves says "Whoa?" Law's character 
basically stays at that level of emotional development for the entire 
movie. Only Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the shy adventurer, plays a fully-
fleshed out human being. She's good, but not good enough to salvage this 
production. 
"eXistenZ" has some redeeming qualities. The score is good and the 
opening scene features some nice moments. Satiric jabs at marketing and 
consumerism are scattered, too infrequently, throughout the story, and 
there is a dandy sequence where several game users critique their own 
virtual characters. But "eXistenZ" is smothered by lousy pacing and an 
awful "been-there, done-that" feeling. Cautionary tales about virtual 
reality have already been covered quite nicely, David Lynch handled 
weirdness more stylishly in any given episode of "Twin Peaks," and 
Cronenberg's gross-out visuals and freaky sexuality are old news. 
Hopefully, before making his next movie, Cronenberg will review "The Dead 
Zone" or "The Fly" and remember how well he can handle the horror genre. 
Or, better yet, maybe he'll take a walk on a sunny day and try to capture 
its essence on film. For the King of Ick, what an accomplishment that 
would be.

Generally, I take meticulous notes during film screenings, but about a 
third of the way through "Psycho," I simply closed my folder, sat back 
and put in my time. Taking notes on this exercise in cinematic mimicry 
seemed pointless. Almost as pointless as the movie.
When director Gus Van Sant made his decision to recreate Alfred 
Hitchcock's horror classic on as close to a shot-by-shot basis as 
possible, he forgot to factor in time. In 1960, "Psycho" was a shocker, 
but this is 1998 and Van Sant's pseudo-Xerox is flat, mannered and often 
downright boring.
Were Alfred Hitchcock alive and remaking "Psycho" today, the finished 
product wouldn't have looked anything like this. Hitchcock would have 
taken into account the myriad horror films released in the 38 years since 
the original, and revised his film accordingly. After exercises in terror 
like "Silence of the Lambs" and an endless stream of slasher flicks, it 
takes a lot to frighten contemporary audiences. Gus Van Sant refuses to 
acknowledge this and the result of his tunnel vision is sad.
His slavish adherence to the original is all the more frustrating because 
of the few cursory changes he does make. Aside from a couple of bare 
asses and some whacking-off sound effects, the most notable change is the 
dollar amount of the stolen money, bumped up from $40,000 to $400,000. If 
Van Sant saw the need to adjust for inflation, why did he stop there? 
Didn't he notice that his "Psycho" isn't particularly scary?
Most of the film just plods along, with Bernard Herrman's magnificent 
score providing far more momentum than anything onscreen. Except for Anne 
Heche, whose paranoid, guilt-ridden attempt at grand larceny is the most 
compelling part of the film, the cast comes up lacking. As Marion Crane, 
Heche gives the character much more depth than Janet Leigh, but her 
screen time is limited. Chad Everett overacts wildly in a minor role. 
Julianne Moore and Viggo Mortensen come off like a bargain basement 
Scully and Mulder, and William H. Macy, looking quite uncomfortable in 
ridiculously anachronistic clothing, is completely wasted.
And then there's Vince Vaughn. To his credit, Vaughn doesn't copy Anthony 
Perkin's landmark performance as Norman Bates. Unfortunately, Vaughn is 
too tall, too imposing and his acting too overtly sinister for the role, 
and his nervous giggle sounds affected. Norman Bates is supposed to 
appear deceptively mild-mannered, but Vaughn's Norman Bates appears 
merely deceptive. The talented actor was much more frightening in the 
recent "Clay Pigeons."
I went into Van Sant's "Psycho" with an open mind, but left the theater 
angry. The film is dedicated to Alfred Hitchcock, but does him a 
disservice by dragging one of his works into an age where it no longer 
fits. If all the publicity surrounding this project intrigues you, rent 
the original. You'll travel back to 1960 and enter an ominous black and 
white realm of shadows and suggestion. You can watch Hitchcock's "Psycho" 
and see a pivotal work that influenced a generation of filmmakers. Or you 
can sit through Van Sant's academic curio of the same name and leave the 
theater scratching your head. This shouldn't be a hard decision to make.

When you see "The End" appear onscreen at the conclusion of "A Bug's Life,
" stay in your seat, because the show isn't over quite yet. The 
filmmakers have added a very clever little treat to the closing credits. 
The rollicking "A Bug's Life" is that kind of movie; so bright, clever 
and eager to please that it does everything but walk you out to your car. 
The computer-animated feature, from the makers of "Toy Story," deftly 
combines comedy, action and razzle-dazzle visuals to produce 94 minutes 
of pure fun.
Flik ("NewsRadio's" Dave Foley, in a spirited performance) is an ant with 
a vision. Eschewing the conformity of the colony, he works on various 
inventions, even as his colleagues roll their eyes at his fanciful 
notions. They're far more concerned with collecting food for the seasonal 
payoff to the grasshoppers; thugs who threaten violence if the ants fail 
to present a sufficient "offering." When Flik accidentally knocks over 
the bounty, invader boss Hopper (Kevin Spacey) delivers a blistering 
edict: if the ants don't collect a double-offering, the grasshoppers will 
wipe out the entire colony. 
Anxious to atone, Flik sets out, in "Seven Samurai" fashion, to gather a 
group of warrior insects to protect the community. He finds what appears 
to be a formidable assemblage of bugs and convinces them to accompany him 
home. Unfortunately, there's been a major miscommunication: the 
"warriors" are in fact a hapless band of circus insects who believe they 
have been hired to put on a show. When the truth comes out, things look 
disastrous for the colony, but wait... Flik has another plan!
"A Bug's Life" earns bonus points for its knock-out supporting characters.
 While the early portion of the film is charming and visually stunning, 
things really don't kick into high gear until the wonderfully eccentric 
members of P.T. Flea's Circus make their appearance. The ants are a sweet,
 but bland, bunch, with only Flik, the Queen (Phyllis Diller), Princess 
Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and young Dot (Hayden Panettiere) really 
displaying any individual sparks. Even they pale in comparison with the 
motley band of circus insects. The group includes a glamorous spider 
(Bonnie Hunt), Hungarian acrobat bugs Tuck and Roll (Michael McShane), a 
grumpy, misunderstood ladybug (Denis Leary) and prickly walking-stick 
insect Slim (a hilarious David Hyde-Pierce). 
Best of all is Manny, an aging, narcissistic praying mantis with regal 
pretensions, played to perfection by Jonathan Harris. When Harris, the 
villainous Dr. Smith from the old "Lost In Space" TV series, was offered 
a cameo in this year's big-screen adaptation of the show, he turned it 
down, sniffing "I don't do bit parts." At the time, I dismissed his words 
as mere prattling from a egocentric has-been. Who knew that the old ham 
had a gig this good up his sleeve?
Without minimizing the pleasures of the similarly-themed "Antz," "A Bug's 
Life" is a much more satisfying film. The production mixes radiant colors,
 a score that echoes epic westerns, and extraordinary imagination in 
creating its miniature landscapes. A visit to an insect city is 
wonderfully realized, with discarded food containers from the human world 
serving as buildings (and, in marked contrast to "Antz," there is nary a 
product placement in sight). Following a riotous circus performance, we 
get a tour of Bugville, complete with a beggar insect sitting on the 
sidewalk with a sign reading "Kid pulled off wings."
The visuals from the computer graphic wizards at Pixar are nothing less 
than breathtaking. A scene depicting Flik taking flight, parasailing on a 
single sprig of a dandelion blossom, is both lyrical and stunning. The 
detail work in the shot shows just how far computer graphics have come in 
the three short years since "Toy Story."
Of course, an adventure film can't succeed without a good villain, and 
Kevin Spacey does terrific work as Hopper, malevolent leader of the 
menacing grasshoppers, playing the character like a swaggering biker from 
"The Wild Ones." Listen closely as the grasshoppers prepare to take off 
and you'll notice that the audio effect boys incorporate the sounds of 
motorcycles revving up into the background noise. Nice touch.
"A Bug's Life" isn't perfect. The secondary ants are unnecessarily bland 
and some of the action scenes are too boisterous for their own good, but 
these are small quibbles. Warm, funny and thrilling, "A Bug's Life" 
represents a powerful stride for computer animated films, as well as yet 
another triumph for the alliance between Disney and Pixar Studios. Get 
ready for one of the best films of the year and don't forget to stay for 
the closing credits.  
Incidentally, "A Bug's Life" is preceded by "Geri's Game," a delightful 
Pixar comic short about an elderly gent's tricks during a chess game in 
the park. Sunny, ingenious and very funny, the feature showcases the best 
computer rendering of the human form to date.

"Big Daddy" is crude and obvious, sloppy and mawkish, contrived and 
clumsily manipulative, and yet it still works. I went back for a second 
screening of the film, curious to see if it would charm me as much as the 
first time, and the damn thing did. The Adam Sandler comedy contains a 
laundry list of elements I find annoying -- standard-issue pratfalls and 
body function gags, sentimentality utterly lacking in finesse and even 
that most tiresome of clichés, the climactic courtroom scene -- but 
despite all the rubbish, there is something special going on here, 
something genuinely good-hearted and even brave, that made me surrender 
to "Big Daddy."
The premise is sheer hokum. When a little kid is left on his doorstep, 32 
year-old slacker Sonny Koufax (Sandler) "adopts" the boy, hoping to prove 
to his girlfriend that he's a responsible adult. She dumps him anyway and 
Sonny grudgingly tries to take care of the child until Social Services 
can find him a home. You can guess the rest.
On the surface, the film appears merely a calculated attempt to satisfy 
long-time Sandler fans with his usual combination of infantile humor and 
bursts of rage, while using the warm and fuzzy plot to nurture the 
mainstream viewers he gained with "The Wedding Singer." But there's more 
going on here than meets the eye. Quietly and oh-so carefully, Adam 
Sandler is challenging his own core audience, the army of young males 
crucial to the success of "Billy Madison," "Happy Gilmore" and "The 
Waterboy."
Outside of right-wing Christian extremists, young males are possibly the 
most homophobic people in America, yet "Big Daddy" includes an accepting 
portrayal of an affectionate gay male couple. The men, two of Sonny's old 
college buddies, behave like any romantic pair, sharing loving glances, 
cuddling and exchanging goodbye kisses. When another of Sonny's pals 
expresses discomfort with the guys' evolution from fellow frat-brothers 
to lovers, Sonny casually dismisses him, saying "They're still our 
brothers... our very, very gay brothers." Any jokes about the couple come 
not from their sexual orientation, but from the flustered reactions of 
others to their sexual orientation. Pretty nervy for an Adam Sandler 
movie.
But wait, there's more. Young males are also known for macho posturing, 
with their displays of bravado masking a fear of strong women, their own 
emotions, and the prospect of adulthood, aging and responsibility in 
general. "Big Daddy" features sisters Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) and 
Corinne (Leslie Mann), two extremely assured young woman. Layla, a 
hotshot lawyer, is clearly infatuated by Sonny, but sets her own 
boundaries and refuses to let him overwhelm her. Corinne is a doctor who 
was once a "Hooters" girl, a fact Sonny never lets her forget, but she 
never buckles despite his nonstop stream of insults (something else to 
consider -- here, Sandler mocks Corinne because she once worked at 
"Hooters" -- in his previous films, his characters would have worshipped 
her for that). 
Sonny comes to grips with his emotions over the course of the story, 
gradually tempering his anger outbursts, freely expressing his love for 
his young ward and even making a heartfelt reconciliation speech to his 
father (that leads to one of the funniest scenes in the movie). He makes 
repeated references to his thickening waistline (although he actually 
looks quite fit) and other aspects of aging and, after many hapless 
attempts at indulgent childrearing, comes to accept and embrace the 
responsibilities of adulthood. 
It's as if Sandler is gently telling his core audience, "Hey guys, it's 
okay to grow up. Confident women, parenthood, emotions and the whole 
aging thing aren't so scary, and by the way, picking on gay people is 
just plain stupid." As I said before, these are pretty daring notions for 
a fan base that considers fart jokes high art.
Of course, this is all subtext in a film that is sloppily constructed, to 
say the least, but it speaks volumes about the production's disarming 
sense of good will. Adding to the appeal is the sweet relationship 
between Sonny and five-year-old Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan 
Sprouse) and the winning performance by "Chasing Amy's" radiant Joey 
Lauren Adams, who makes the most of her limited screen time. 
As for the rest of the cast, Rob Schneider is fun as an immigrant 
delivery man grappling with the English language and Steve Buscemi has a 
few good lines as a homeless man. Jon Stewart, playing Sonny's roommate, 
is sadly underused and Josh Mostel merely annoys as an ex-hippie turned 
priggish social worker.   
Despite its flaws, its many, many flaws, "Big Daddy" is a satisfying 
offering. In this cynical age, it's refreshing to see a movie that 
celebrates love, maturity and acceptance of others. Hopefully, as Adam 
Sandler continues to grow, both as an actor and a filmmaker, it will 
become easier to praise his work without having to add so many qualifying 
statements.

Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are
prison escapees with a dream: They want to run a resort south of the
border, entertaining guests while savoring that perfect mixture of hot
sun and cool ocean breeze. "I just have one question," asks Terry, "How
do we pay for it?" "Well," says Joe, "we are bank robbers."
The men come up with an interesting gimmick. Instead of simply bursting
into banks and demanding cash, they start off early, going to the home
of the bank manager and his family the night before the heist and taking
them hostage. After soothing the family, they all have dinner together
and get a good night's rest. Then, the next morning, they go to the bank
before normal business hours and quietly take the money. No fuss, no
muss.
The plan works like a charm and the duo gains fame as "The Sleepover
Bandits." Frequently profiled on the weekly TV crime program "Criminals
at Large," they become folk heroes.
Everything changes one day when Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett), a
disaffected housewife, hits Terry with her car. She hooks up with the
boys as they continue robbing their way down the West Coast, from Oregon
towards California. Along the way, romance rears its inconvenient little
head. First Joe falls for Kate, then Terry does the same. Kate enjoys
the group dynamic  Joe is handsome, charismatic and self-absorbed,
while Terry is sensitive, intellectual and a hypochondriac 
individually the guys are deeply flawed, but collectively they make the
perfect man.
Needless to say, Joe and Terry do not share her enthusiasm. Jealousy
between the two friends simmers, while their growing notoriety makes it
ever more difficult for them to follow their modus operandi. Eventually,
the estranged friends end up in a crowded bank, with police officers, TV
cameras and spectators galore outside, aiming their guns at each other.
Which brings us to the beginning of the film.
Yes, "Bandits" is one of those kind of movies, opening at a crucial
moment, then using narrative and flashbacks to show how everything came
together. Directed by Barry Levinson, whose work has ranged from the
sublime ("Rain Man") to well, to "Sphere" and written by Harley Peyton
of "Twin Peaks" fame, the film is entertaining, but suffers from a lack
of discipline, loping along too casually and clocking in at 125 minutes.
The finished product screams for editing. Had Levinson and company been
forced to cut out around 20 minutes, the story would have packed more
punch. As is, the latter part of the production is repetitive and talky.
Have you ever had a friend who came to call with a wealth of good
anecdotes, only to overstay and jabber too much? "Bandits" is the
cinematic equivalent of that verbose visitor.
Still, there is much to enjoy. Filming in the American northwest gives
the movie a different look than most Hollywood offerings. The locations
seem crisper and earthier than what we usually see.
The rapport of the cast is a plus. Willis, Thornton and Blanchett work
well together, establishing a nice rhythm with their banter. The
individual performances vary in quality. Bruce Willis, in full
smirk-mode, offers nothing new. Those who are put off when Willis starts
swaggering should take a few deep breaths and concentrate on the work of
his co-stars.
Cate Blanchett, an actor of considerable skills, pulls another bright
performance from her bag of tricks. In the role of Kate (described as
"an iceberg waiting for the Titanic"), she crackles with intelligence,
sensuality and skittering energy. Physically, she looks like a young
Rene Russo this time around.
Once again, Billy Bob Thornton surprises with the range of his acting
abilities. He drops any hint of his trademark drawl while playing Terry,
investing the extremely bright character with an endearing fragility.
Unfortunately, as the screenplay meanders on and on, he is forced to up
the ante of his hypochondria. By the latter portion of the film, he
deteriorates into little more than a bundle of twitches and grimaces.
The fourth member of the group is Joe's cousin Harvey J. Pollard (Troy
Garity), who drives for the robbers, but tells anyone who will listen
that his true goal is to become a Hollywood stuntman. In fact, he says
it so many times that even the least attentive audience members will
recognize that his career aspiration will somehow play a role in the
climax of the tale.
With another script rewrite and some ruthless editing, "Bandits" could
have been a grand mixture of character study and nonsense. In its
current form, it serves as a windy, moderately entertaining trifle. You
could do a lot worse than "Bandits," but the filmmakers could have done
much better.

For film buffs, there are few things more annoying than movie trailers 
that give away too much of the plot. The pinnacle of this peculiar form 
of marketing comes with the promotional campaign for "Double Jeopardy," a 
"Fugitive" knock-off starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. If you've 
seen the commercials for the film, there's no need to visit the theater, 
because the ads are a veritable Cliffs Notes version of the thriller, 
spilling every major plot point of the story. 
Here's what the ads reveal (SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS THE 
ENTIRE PLOT). We open with Ashley Judd and Bruce Greenwood, sailing 
happily on a sunny day. Cut to night, as Ashley searches for her husband. 
She finds a bloody knife on the deck and picks it up, just in time for 
the Coast Guard to appear and order her not to move. Cut to a man 
informing the stunned Ashley that a $2 million insurance policy would 
certainly be considered motive for murder. Ashley exclaims "I didn't kill 
my husband!" Cut to Ashley in prison, as the announcer intones "In prison 
for a crime she didn't commit... " Cut to a woman answering the phone 
with Ashley's son at her side. Just as mother and child begin their 
tender phone reunion, we see the father walk in the door. The young lad 
happily shouts "Daddy!" Cut to a close up of Ashley, shocked beyond 
belief as she realizes the truth. Cut to a fellow inmate, who explains to 
Ashley that having already been committed of murdering her husband, she 
could now kill him without fear of legal repercussions, thanks to the 
"double jeopardy" rule that protects a defendant from being tried twice 
for the same crime. Cut to Ashley, out of prison, being pursued by Tommy 
Lee Jones. Cut to an elderly lady informing Ashley that the man she is 
searching for recently lost his new wife in a "tragic accident." Ashley 
nods knowingly. Cut to Tommy Lee, telling an officer "Did you ever arrest 
anybody you thought was innocent?" Cut to Ashley, confronting her husband 
while holding a gun in her hand and saying "I could shoot you in the 
middle of Mardi Gras and the cops couldn't do a thing." Cut to Tommy Lee, 
who tells the man "As a former law professor, I can assure you she's 
correct." The panicked hubby begs for help, only to have Tommy Lee smile 
wryly and say "Why are you talking to me? She has the gun." (END 
SPOILERS)
For the benefit of those who skipped the spoiler section and didn't see 
the ads, the film, which starts in the Northwest and ends in New Orleans, 
is an idiotic potboiler, redeemed only slightly by pretty scenery, a 
couple of well-staged chase scenes and the presence of Ashley Judd and 
Tommy Lee Jones (although why they are slumming in glossy trash like this 
is beyond me). "Double Jeopardy" is fun only as a guilty pleasure, one of 
those "so-bad-that-it's good" movies. Unless you're a fan of that genre, 
I suggest you simply watch the commercial and save 105 minutes of your 
life.

Review for Boogie Nights (1997)
Boogie Nights (1997)
Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham.
 Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.
Rated R, 4 out of 5 stars
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

In terms of highly anticipated films, "Boogie Nights" is the 500 pound 
gorilla of the fall season. For months, through reports from trade 
screenings and film festivals, the buzz for this sprawling look at the L.
A. world of pornographic filmmaking in the 70s has been phenomenal. The 
big surprise is that the actual movie almost lives up to all of the hype. 
Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's wildly entertaining epic captures 
the late 70s/early 80s era in all its tacky glory, with terrific 
performances from a large ensemble cast. To be sure, the film has its 
problems. After a near-perfect first hour and a half, Anderson stumbles 
badly during an abrupt transition in tone, but quickly regains his 
footing for a powerhouse wrap-up. "Boogie Nights" is two and one half 
hours long, but the time whizzes by. 
The film tells the rags-to-riches-to-rags story of a young man with a 
dream. 17-year-old busboy Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) believes that 
"everyone is blessed with one special gift." In Eddie's case, the gift is 
a 13" penis and boundless sexual energy. Seasoned porn filmmaker Jack 
Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers the kid and before you can say John 
Holmes, Eddie becomes Dirk Diggler, porn superstar.
A great deal of the fun in "Boogie Nights" comes from Anderson's perfect 
re-creation of the outrageous attitudes and godawful fashions of the 70s, 
the most embarrassing decade in memory. Bad taste reigned supreme back 
then, and it's all up there on the screen; a leisure-suited, polyester 
paean to days gone by. It was an era of unparalleled hedonism as well, 
and the film overflows with scenes of copious drug use and unprotected 
sex. In the 70s, pornography went from being everyone's dirty little 
secret to actually becoming trendy; accordingly, Jack Horner and his 
entourage wheel around Los Angeles like kings and queens.  
Once a movie star, more recently a national joke, Burt Reynolds reclaims 
his career with his portrayal of Jack Horner. Reynolds ditches his 
trademark smirks and cackles, playing the character in an straightforward,
 extremely assured manner. Jack Horner is a wry old pro who knows the 
business of pornography, and Reynold's performance is earning him the 
respect he has always almost had. As Dirk Diggler, Mark Wahlberg is 
excellent, evolving from shallow kid to pampered superstar to desperate 
stoner, all while maintaining a disarming sense of naiveté. 
In real life, Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg have led similar careers. 
Both became pop icons by taking their clothes off (Reynolds as the first 
male centerfold in Cosmopolitan, Wahlberg in the legendary Calvin Klein 
underwear ads.)  Both mismanaged their fame and saw their careers decline.
 It's ironic that the men have now achieved redemption in a film dealing 
with sex, drugs and violence. Ironic, and kind of nice.
Wahlberg and Reynolds aren't the only good actors here. The casting of 
"Boogie Nights" is virtually flawless, with standout performances from 
Julianne Moore as Amber Waves, the earth mother of the group; "Swingers" 
Heather Graham as the blissed-out Rollergirl and Don Cheadle as Buck 
Swope, a porn actor whose real ambition is to open up a "really bitchin' 
stereo store."
27-year-old Anderson's influences show in both the structure and the film 
techniques of "Boogie Nights," not that that's necessarily a bad thing. 
Beginning with a long, gliding track shot, the first two thirds of the 
film are reminiscent of Martin Scorcese's "Goodfellas," with hints of 
Robert Altman's "Nashville." The last third of the film comes straight 
from the hyper-violent land of "Pulp Fiction's" Quentin Tarantino, with a 
twisted homage to Scorcese's "Raging Bull" wrapping things up. Anderson's 
big stumble comes in the films last third, as the action shifts from the 
decadent late 70s to the greedy 80s. After an hour and a half of giddy 
randomness, Anderson lunges into a cluster of scenes depicting various 
characters suffering a variety of nasty consequences to their earlier 
actions. The sequences badly thrown off the rhythm of the film, making it 
feel like some demented Afterschool Special. Luckily, he regains his 
balance quickly, leading into a terrifying, dazzling segment of a drug 
deal gone wrong that ranks among the most riveting scenes ever laid down 
on film.
To its credit, "Boogie Nights" doesn't make any grand statement about the 
human condition. The film is just a series of stories about a intriguing 
group of people during a very goofy and dangerous period of American 
culture. What makes this film transcendent is Anderson's vast talent and 
the sheer exhilaration of his vision. Each of us is blessed with one 
special gift and Anderson certainly has discovered his.

Midway through "American Beauty," a young man obsessed with videotaping 
asks a new friend if she'd like to see the most beautiful thing he ever 
filmed. He shows her a video of an empty plastic grocery sack caught in a 
breeze. With a brick wall behind it and a leaf-strewn sidewalk below, the 
bag dances in the wind; darting, fluttering, almost touching the ground, 
only to be swept up again to continue its herky-jerky aerial ballet. The 
image is mesmerizing and neatly underscores the film's central theme: 
look closer. 
Silky, seductive and unsettling, "American Beauty" is an dazzling piece 
of movie-making, nimbly shifting from dark comedy to drama to horror to 
pure poetry and back again. While its examination of what lies beneath 
the well-manicured facade of suburban life is nothing new ("The Ice Storm,
" "Happiness" and "Blue Velvet" are just a few of the works that have 
covered similar turf), the film's nervy script and remarkably assured 
approach, coupled with flawless cinematography and use of music, yields 
numerous rewards all its own. 
The story begins with a shot of a red door, accompanied by a voice-over 
introduction from lead character Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). "I'm 42 
years old," he quietly intones. "In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of 
course, I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already." Indeed he is. 
For years, Lester has gone through life on cruise control. He cohabits a 
house with his high-strung wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening) and sullen 
daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) in an atmosphere of simmering animosity. His 
job as a writer for a dull media publication hangs by a thread. Most of 
the time he is numb. "I know I've lost something," he says, "but I don't 
know what it is." One thing he does know is that he didn't always feel 
this sedated.
It's easy to toss around phrases like "mid-life crisis," but actually 
experiencing the phenomena is another matter entirely. Dealing with the 
prospect of one's own mortality, while realizing that the vitality of 
life has been smothered by day-to-day routine and the Quixotic quest for 
the illusion of security, is absolutely devastating. From the inside, a 
mid-life crisis is a Herculean struggle for survival of the soul that can 
lead a person to some pretty strange behavior.  
Two events trigger Lester's peculiar epiphany: the loss of his job and 
his infatuation with a gorgeous high school girl. At a cheerleading 
demonstration, he falls head over heels in lust for his daughter's best 
friend, Angela (Mena Suvani). Determined to seduce her, he starts pumping 
iron with a vengeance (she likes tight pecs), striving to recapture the 
appearance and passion of his youth.
Informed by his boss that his services will no longer be needed, Lester 
blackmails the man into giving him a big severance package. Freed of his 
job and financial concerns, he launches into a giddy joyride of 
irresponsibility. Remembering his carefree youthful days at a fast-food 
joint, Lester takes a job flipping burgers at Mr. Smiley. He smokes dope 
openly while cruising around town in his new dream car, begins speaking 
with devastating frankness and adopts an impulsive approach to life. 
The new Lester leaves his wife horrified and his daughter disgusted. 
Carolyn focuses desperately on her work as a real estate agent, while 
eyeing Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), known in realty circles as "The King.
" Jane hooks up with a strange new neighbor kid, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who 
deals dope, videotapes everything and constantly ducks from his severe 
drill-instructor of a father (Chris Cooper) and near-catatonic mother 
(Allison Janney). The tension within this circle of humanity is palpable 
and an explosion is clearly imminent. 
Kevin Spacey anchors the swirl of conflict with the best performance of 
his already stellar career. As Lester changes from repressed sardonic 
loser to freewheeling overage kid, Spacey is stunning, totally inhabiting 
the character. Despite his pursuit of an underage girl, you care for this 
man caught up in the heady euphoria of living without a safety net.
"American Beauty" navigates a fine line, creating stereotypes for the 
social satire, then humanizing the players for the drama. It doesn't 
always work. A great effort from Annette Bening manages to make Carolyn 
more than a materialist cliché, but even an actor of Chris Cooper's skill 
cannot turn Ricky's militaristic father into more than an evil cartoon. 
The film's biggest misstep comes with a kiss late in the proceedings. 
Intended as a revelation, the kiss is too easy a shock, playing like a 
page out of Psych 101. Understand, though, that I'm nit-picking. Even 
with its flaws, "American Beauty" is a whale of a movie. More than 
anything, it provokes thought and reflection, something that happens all 
too rarely in contemporary cinema. The film is similar to a Rorschach 
Test. How you react to this compelling, ambitious creation could reveal a 
bit about your place in this amazing corporeal journey we share. Look 
closer.

Once in a while, I refer to a movie as a "chick flick," triggering a
handful of angry letters from people who find the term demeaning to
women. Hopefully, this review will help even things out. "Men of Honor"
is a "dick flick," the kind of movie that male best friends slap in the
VCR while drinking a few beers. "Dick flicks" focus on men following
their dreams, manly men who never give up because, damn it, they are
made of the right stuff! Invariably, the lead character has issues with
his father that are either resolved in a cathartic face to face with Dad
or through a significant encounter with a father figure. Almost always,
dick flicks include a horrific accident or a death, with tears and male
bonding galore. These moments come late in the film, giving the best
buddy viewers time to down enough beer to comfortably sniffle along with
the characters onscreen.
"Men of Honor" is far from being a great movie. The production is
generally overwrought, the dialogue is trite, it's about 25 minutes too
long and it includes that most dreaded of clichés, the climactic
courtroom scene, complete with an emotionally manipulative score. As
someone who earns his living reviewing films, it is my duty to point out
these things and treat them with disdain.
But I must tell you, in the dick flick genre, overwrought is good and
trite dialogue is forgivable (after all, it's easier to quote on repeat
viewings). As long as the film packs a macho punch, there is no such
thing as too long, and courtroom scenes are welcome because they lead to
speechifying, and best friends watching a flick and drinking beer
absolutely love speechifying.
This particular overwrought story is "based on the life" of Carl
Brashear, which means that his onscreen heroism is probably close to the
truth, while all the secondary characters are suspect. Cuba Gooding Jr.
handles the inspirational role quite well, which is no big surprise,
since the Oscar winning "Jerry Maguire" star is essentially a
motivational speech given human form.
We meet Brashear in Sonora, Kentucky in 1943, as his hard-working,
extremely poor father implores him to better himself. Years later, the
young man joins the Navy, with visions of becoming a diver. Instead, he
ends up slicing potatoes in the kitchen, as a coworker explains that
there are only three options for a black man in the Navy: be a cook, an
officer's valet, or get out of the military.
He doesn't give up, of course, and his speed in the water earns him a
spot on the Search and Rescue team. After much work, he becomes the
first black accepted in the Naval diving school. But, although
desegregation is the rule, discrimination remains the norm. Save for
one, all of the other men refuse to bunk with him and, to make matters
worse; his instructor is Master Chief Billy Sunday, a world-class bigot.
As Billy Sunday, Robert De Niro gives a terrific performance. Snappy and
fast, De Niro creates a completely new man, instead of merely playing a
variant of his standard tough guy persona, as has been his wont in
recent years. Sunday, who also came from humble beginnings, is an
alcoholic cracker with a redwood-sized chip on his shoulder. He also is
very good at his job.
Like "Remember the Titans," "Men of Honor" deals with determination in
the face of racism, but in a more believable fashion than the Disney
film. Certain characters make inroads towards conquering their bigotry,
and they manage to do so without breaking into any song and dance
numbers, thank God. The film also boasts genuinely tense face-offs, as
well as some nicely shot underwater action scenes. Standouts include a
submerged test sequence and a gripping bit of nastiness involving a
rogue submarine.
While Gooding remains front and center for the entire film and De Niro
is given ample opportunity to flesh out Billy Sunday, the supporting
characters are given short shrift. Aunjanue Ellis has a few juicy
moments as Jo, Brashear's love interest, but is mostly relegated to the
background. Charlize Theron breezes in and out as Sunday's wife and
Michael Rapaport stutters sympathetically, while David Keith, Hal
Holbrook and Powers Boothe barely get their faces onscreen.
As an inspirational drama, "Men of Honor" is generic and poky, redeemed
only somewhat by the two leads and the periodic effective segments. The
film will not go down in the dick flick hall of fame either, but it gets
the job done in that department. My suggestion: Wait until it comes out
on video, invite your best pal over, drink a few beers together and be
ready to have a fine, uncritical, overwrought evening.

Some of my fondest memories from childhood are of family trips to the
drive-in. Dad would slowly weave through the lanes looking for a spot
that afforded a good view of the screen with no neighboring carloads of
teen-agers. After ricocheting around the playground and visiting the
refreshment stand  seedy, vaguely threatening and always alluring  my
sister and brother and I would settle in for a few cartoons and at least
two, sometimes three, feature films. More often than not, the movies
were wholesome fare, but every so often my parents would select
something more risqué.
I remember Mom fretting over the appropriateness of such "trashy"
selections; convinced they would irreparably warp our little minds.
"Don't worry," my father assured her, "as soon as the kids eat and watch
the cartoons, they'll fall asleep." But I never did. Peering from the
back seat with saucer eyes, I drank in the lurid images of juvenile
delinquents gone wild: smoking, drinking, fighting, making out and
driving like hell-bent lunatics. Such glorious decadence! Even then, I
realized that the exploitation flicks were cheap, formulaic and, most of
the time, poorly acted. It didn't matter, though. In fact, it even
helped. The chintzy predictability was oddly comforting.
"The Fast and the Furious" is a throwback to the drive-in era. A
105-minute exercise in high-octane car chases and macho posturing, the
film is pure drivel, which is exactly why I enjoyed it. After sitting
through a seemingly endless steam of inept comedies and pretentious
action movies, it's refreshing to see a production so unrepentantly
cheesy. The movie simply is what it is, an instantly forgettable
diversion for those in the mood for cheap thrills, swaggering men, bad
girls and melodrama as aggressive as it is dumb.
Directed by Rob Cohen, the man responsible for the indefensible Ivy
League Secret Society thriller, "The Skulls," "The Fast and the Furious"
is set in Los Angeles, specifically the underworld of illegal street
racing. The story begins with a wicked-good truck heist, in which the
harpoon-equipped drivers of several souped-up cars relieve the trucker
of a great deal of electronic equipment. The increasing frequency of
such crimes has caught the attention of the LAPD and FBI, and the
authorities have a plan.
Their secret weapon is Brian Spindler (Paul Walker from "The Skulls" and
"Varsity Blues." Damn, what a résumé!), a pretty boy officer who
constantly looks as if he is recovering from a blow to the head from a
blunt object. Brian's job is to infiltrate the dominant gang in the
street-racing subculture and learn if they are involved in the rip-offs.
To do this, he employs a brilliant plan: After securing a job in an auto
parts shop, he goes to a convenience store/diner run by racing leader
Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and, day after day, orders tuna sandwiches
on white bread (with the crusts cut off, natch) from the powerful man's
younger sister, Mia (Jordanna Brewster).
His chronic tuna-ordering leads to a confrontation with a gang member,
triggering another big-ass action scene incorporating grunting males
staking their turf, an encounter with Johnny Law and a wild car chase.
By the time all is said and done, Dominic admits Brian into the inner
circle, a move which infuriates the more hotheaded of his crew.
The rest of the movie goes just as you would expect it to go. Brian
bonds with Dominic and woos Mia (as with most male-oriented flicks, the
relationship between the boys is far more intense than the one between
the boy and girl), periodically slipping away to report to his antsy
superior officers. Brian bumps chests with alpha males threatened by his
easy acceptance, with Big Daddy Dominic stepping in to settle things
down. In-between the testosterone-fueled snarling, the flashy street
races continue, as do the heists. It all builds to a dandy climactic
action scene spiced with overwrought dialogue and lots of meaningful
glances.
While Paul Walker is laughably miscast as the undercover cop, Vin Diesel
anchors the proceedings as the charismatic Dominic. With a shaved head
and muscular frame, Diesel casts an imposing presence nicely tempered by
moments of tenderness. You've likely enjoyed Diesel's work before: He
was one of Tom Hank's troop in "Saving Private Ryan," he played the
mysterious tough guy in "Pitch Black" and he provided the voice of the
robot in "The Iron Giant." Diesel is destined for big things and who
knows, this may be the movie that does it for him. After all, any guy
capable of delivering lines like "I live my life a quarter-mile at a
time" with a straight face deserves to be a star.
Filled with action set pieces and oozing attitude, "The Fast and the
Furious" is trash, but it's my kind of trash. To best enjoy it, I
suggest you track down a drive-in (thankfully, there are a few left),
weave through the lanes until you find a spot that affords a good view
of the screen with no neighboring carloads of teen-agers, stock up on
junk food from the snack bar, then sit back and savor the stupidity.

In "American History X," Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance 
as Derek Vinyard, a racist skinhead. What a sight he is to behold. Black 
and white flashbacks show Derek, often shirtless and very buff, dazzling 
those around him with his ferocious rhetoric and fiery behavior. He is 
smart, sexy and charismatic and it's easy to understand why others are 
drawn to him. 
"American History X" works the audience as well as Derek works his 
followers. While the racist words and actions are incredibly repellent, 
the flashback scenes are lovingly filmed in an attractive, high-quality 
music video fashion. Even when the action turns horribly violent, it's 
depicted as stylishly as a commercial for perfume or blue jeans. The 
filmmakers condemn the hate, but the perpetrators of said hate look so 
damn cool. Think "Pulp Fiction" or "A Clockwork Orange" and you'll know 
what I mean. 
The intent is obvious. The film uses sex and style to draw us in, then 
flips everything around to rub our noses in our own voyeuristic 
complicity. We viscerally experience how seductive well-phrased hate 
speech and violent imagery can be, then we are shown the tragic 
consequences of that mentality. It's a risky tactic. I've read reports of 
skinheads cheering during sections of "American History X." Sadly, some 
people will walk out of this film energized by the hate rhetoric and 
glamorization of violence. Hopefully, most viewers will get the point. 
Set in sunny Venice Beach, we meet young Danny (Edward Furlong), a bright 
student who worships older brother Derek, a zealot in the local white 
supremacist movement. Derek's rhetoric turns to action, ending in a 
brutal assault that lands him in prison for manslaughter. Three years 
later, on the day of Derek's release, Danny hands his teacher a glowing 
essay on "Mein Kampf." The furious instructor hauls the boy to Principal 
Sweeney (Avery Brooks), who assigns the kid a new project. He must write 
a paper, to be titled "American History X," that documents the 
circumstances that led his brother to prison. Danny returns home for a 
festive neo-Nazi reunion with his brother, only to learn that Derek had a 
major change of heart in prison. He now rejects his former beliefs and 
wants his brother to do the same. But is it too late? 
Danny's work on his paper provides the framework for the story, as 
flashbacks introduce the Vinyard's extended family and the environment 
from which the hatred grew. Director Tony Kaye (who unsuccessfully tried 
to have his name removed from the film over an editing dispute) presents 
a series of exceptionally vivid vignettes. We witness a confrontation 
between blacks and whites on a basketball court, various family fights, 
meetings between Derek and the manipulator behind the skinhead group 
(Stacy Keach), a horrific gang attack on a Korean grocery, and, of course,
 Derek's fatal assault on some black petty thieves. 
One of the most disturbing scenes shows the boy's father, a weary 
firefighter, in a dinner-table speech that begins with his complaints 
about affirmative action and escalates into a racist diatribe. What makes 
the monologue so disquieting is its familiarity. Anyone who listens to 
conservative talk radio has heard the early portions of the father's 
argument. It's frightening to see how easily it turns from a hard-working 
family man's expression of frustration and perceived injustice into 
something very dangerous. The scene is a powerful reminder that people 
don't magically become monsters. It's a slower, much more insidious 
process that happens in all too many American homes.
"American History X" is a flawed work. Aside from Norton and Furlong, 
most of the other characters are little more than rough sketches. Derek's 
conversion from neo-Nazi back to human is sufficiently explained, but 
still seems a bit too abrupt. And some of Kaye's camera tricks, 
particularly the many shots of water in slow motion, are overly-mannered 
and distracting.
Still, the film packs a hell of a punch. If you want to see a powerful 
movie that depicts skinheads without a hint of romanticism, rent the 
devastating "Romper Stomper." But if you're willing to submit to a movie 
that goes a step further, not only condemning bigotry and violence but 
also challenging contemporary filmgoers, like us, who embrace cinematic 
depictions of violence and hate, give "American History X" a chance. You 
won't feel comfortable when you leave the theater, but you'll have a lot 
to think about.

When the scandal over Bill Clinton's sexual desk-capades exploded, we
watched the President of the United States squirm before his inquisitors
like a 12-year-old boy whose mother caught him with a copy of Hustler.
As Clinton dodged questions, played word games and lied outright, many
of us wondered, "Why in the world is he subjecting himself to this? Why
doesn't he simply tell them his sex life is none of their business and
refuse to answer any questions about his private goings-on?"
According to "The Contender," the approach wouldn't work because once
the political wolf pack realized that their quarry was adamant about not
commenting on personal questions, they could freely lob even more lurid
accusations, secure in the knowledge that no assertion, however
outrageous, would be refuted.
Depressing, isn't it? Politics is a nasty business and "The Contender"
wallows in the muck. Masquerading as a high-minded ethical drama, the
movie is just another trashy melodrama, with a slew of respected actors
chewing scenery.
Written and directed by Rod Lurie ("Deterrence"), the story begins a few
weeks after the unexpected death of the vice-president. A replacement
must be appointed and Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen)
looks like a shoo-in for the position. Already a popular figure, his
stature rises quickly when, while being interviewed by a reporter during
a fishing excursion, a car plummets off a bridge and the governor
immediately dives into the icy water to attempt a rescue.
But President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) has other ideas. Determined
to stake out his place in the history books, Evans announces that a
woman, Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), is his choice for the
job. The decision enrages a number of imposing figures, including House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman) of Illinois.
Heading the confirmation hearings, Runyon pulls out all the stops in his
quest to discredit Hanson. In short order, the soft-spoken nominee is
confronted with allegations that, while in college, she participated in
a gang-bang with a group of frat boys. Instead of doing the Clinton
squirm, Hanson declares that her sexuality is nobody's business,
refusing to "dignify this line of questioning with any comments." Even
when presented with photographic evidence, she remains mute, firm in her
conviction that a line must be drawn between public life and personal
matters.
So the political maneuvering escalates, with Runyon and his minions
leveling even uglier charges while the president and his staff
frantically work on damage control. How will this drama play out?
With lots of speechifying and a juicy contrived ending, of course.
"The Contender" does a number of things right. The film identifies the
party affiliations of its characters (a rarity in this type of fiction)
and makes direct references to real politicians and events. The verbose
storyline maintains a sense of tension all the way to the grand, goofy,
finale. Jeff Bridges creates a believable president, coming off like a
hunky Lyndon Johnson (although a running joke about his delight in being
able to order any food item at any hour wears thin about the fifth time
around). And Gary Oldman is enjoyable as Runyon, a nasty, paranoid,
hypocritical power broker reminiscent of Representative Dan Burton, the
infamous Indiana pit bull who chased cars all the way to Washington, DC.
Oldman has a field day with the role, spitting out melodramatic lines
like "We're both sticking to our guns, only mine are loaded" with
relish.
While the production suffers from one-note supporting characters,
chintzy sets and claustrophobic camera work, the film's biggest
liability is Laine Hanson. The Republican-turned-Democrat Senator, who
voted to impeach President Clinton, is a pro-gun control, pro-choice,
anti-death penalty vegetarian atheist who publicly described the Bible
as a "fairy tale." She apparently was elected on some parallel Earth,
because she certainly would not have won in the Ohio of this planet.
Joan Allen basically reprises her role in "The Crucible" here, playing
the potential vice-president as a "Goodie" Hanson of prim
self-containment. This character should face reporters and declare,
"Unless this country wants to scare off any competent persons, we must
stop putting politicians' private lives under a microscope. It may cost
me the vice-presidency, but I'm standing up for what I believe!"
Instead, she merely reiterates her refusal to discuss personal matters,
offering herself as a maddeningly passive martyr.
Luckily for her, the president and his bad boys are more than willing to
get down and dirty on her behalf. The moral of the story appears to be
that idealism and nobility can succeed in the world of politics, as long
as lies, threats and dirty tricks support those qualities. In terms of
disposable entertainment, "The Contender" is marginally acceptable junk
food. As an intellectual exercise, however, it left me with an upset
stomach.

I've been a fan of "Rugrats," the hit Nickelodeon cartoon series, for a 
long time. Tommy (voiced by E.G. Daily) is the plucky leader of the 
precocious toddlers, accompanied by his best friend, the timid, but loyal,
 Chuckie (Christine Cavanaugh). Earthy twins Phil and Lil (Kath Soucie) 
complete the fab four, with Angela (Cheryl Chase), Tommy's slightly older,
 very bratty cousin, always ready to cause trouble for the babies. The 
charm of the show comes from the kids' innocent outlook on the world, as 
well as their refreshingly matter-of-fact approach to dirt, bugs and body 
functions. Adding to the fun is the show's gently satiric portrayals of 
the infants' colorful parents and grandparents. 
"The Rugrats Movie" marks the first big-screen foray for the kids and any 
movie featuring a nursery full of singing newborns who create a fountain 
of water by peeing into the air is all right in my book. That said, "The 
Rugrats Movie" disappointments in a number of ways. While the film 
features nice music and boasts a number of ingenious moments, it overdoes 
the bombast, making the babies play second fiddle to a series of raucous 
action scenes and parodies of other movies.
Following a take-off of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the main storyline 
kicks in. Tommy Pickles' life is disrupted by the arrival of baby brother 
Dil (Tara Charendoff), whose nonstop howling drives the child to 
distraction. When Tommy and company decide to return Dil to the "baby 
store," they hop in the Reptar Wagon, a super-powered Big Wheel created 
by Tommy's inventor father, Stu (Jack Riley, Mr. Carlin from "The Bob 
Newhart Show") and promptly get lost in the forest, leading to a series 
of misadventures with escaped circus monkeys, a wolf and various other 
scary things. Meanwhile, the families, aided by two forest rangers 
(Whoopi Goldberg and David Spade), desperately search for the kids, while 
the press (led by Tim Curry) bombard them with idiotic questions.
Judging from the laughter and applause, the kids at the screening I 
attended loved every second of the movie, especially the numerous body 
function jokes. My reaction was less enthusiastic. After a strong 
beginning, the film turns into a overly busy action movie, and that's not 
what I came to see. I love the "Rugrats" series not because of the action,
 but rather the characters' conversations and responses during the action.
 In the series, we get to hear the babies talk to each other, and the 
glimpses into their personalities provide the charm and fun of the show. 
There's some of that in the movie, but not nearly enough. Too much of the 
film consists of everyone racing frantically about, avoiding one brush 
with disaster after another. I can get that with any movie. From the 
"Rugrats," I look for personality, and the film comes up short in that 
department.
Because of the clever moments, the nifty soundtrack and my affection for 
the characters, I'm giving "The Rugrats Movie" a marginal recommendation. 
The film's target audience of little kids should make the production a 
hit. But if the filmmakers want to satisfy the grown-ups (and make no 
mistake, the TV show has a huge adult following), they'll tone down the 
frenzied action and turn up the personality and quiet moments for the 
next "Rugrats" movie.

The media kit for "The Perfect Storm" begins with a special request that
reads, "Warner Brothers Pictures would appreciate the press' cooperation in
not revealing the ending of this film to their readers, viewers or
listeners." Fair enough, but for this to work, everyone needs to do his or
her part. So, if you are one of the millions who saw the news reports of the
event in 1991, or if you read Sebastian Junger's book on the subject, which
was on the New York Times bestseller list for over two years, remember:
Mum's the word.
I believe in revealing as little about a movie's plot as possible (and will
adhere to the WB guidelines in this review), but trying to hide the facts
about this widely reported news story strikes me as more than a bit silly.
Imagine the press kit for "Titanic" stating "Please don't tell anyone the
boat sank."
Incidentally, it appears that Warner Brothers forgot to make the same
request of their cast, because I've heard two actors spill the beans on late
night talk shows over the past week.
Set in Gloucester, Massachusetts, a major North Atlantic fishing port, "The
Perfect Storm" deals with those who make their livings from the sea and
focuses on a storm of almost indescribable ferocity, created when three
raging weather fronts collided. Pity the crew of the Andrea Gail, a
swordfishing boat that ventures hundreds of miles out in search of a big
catch. The storm hits full force just as their ice machine breaks down,
leaving the men with two choices: dump their lucrative boatload of fish and
venture even further out to sea in search of calm waters, or try to salvage
their income and pride by navigating through the worst storm in recorded
history.
Sitting in our comfy middle-class homes, we may consider the correct
decision to be painfully obvious. But as the film establishes during its
opening 40 minutes, these people live an extremely challenging life that
requires risks to be taken on a regular basis.
Unfortunately, the screenplay fails to fully flesh out the men as
individuals. The extremely talented cast, led by George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg and John C. Reilly, must deal with sketchily drawn characters. The
actors give it their all, but remain stereotypes rather than realized
individuals. The folks on the shore, including Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
and Diane Lane, have little more to do than cry, shout and look worried.
Credit must be given to Rusty Schwimmer, a large woman with an incredibly
expressive face. When crew member Bugsy (John Hawkes) hits on her the night
before the Gail sets off to sea, she recognizes that his need goes beyond a
quick lay. In a quietly touching scene, she shows up dockside the next
morning so that he won't be the only man without anyone to see him off.
As for the storm, I found Wolfgang Petersen's direction so engrossing that I
failed to evaluate the quality of the special effects. The other critics in
attendance complained of numerous unconvincing images, but I didn't notice.
Several action set pieces are thrilling, particularly a shark attack on the
deck of the Gail, Captain Clooney's exploits while trying to repair a broken
mast, and the Coast Guard's amazing rescue efforts.
Speaking of the Coast Guard, a Discovery Channel documentary on the storm
identified the rescue crew by name and featured interviews with them. "The
Perfect Storm" would be a far more satisfying film had they made those Coast
Guard members as prominent, rather than using them as anonymous supporting
players. Unfortunately, to explain further, I would have to violate the
Warner Brothers request, but, after you see the movie, I'm sure you'll know
what I mean.

Schell, Morgan Freeman, Leelee Sobieski, James Cromwell, Mark McCormack,

Determined to separate their film from this season's other "Yikes! 
There's a giant rock headed straight for Earth!" movie, the "Deep Impact" 
producers emphasize that "Armageddon" (due July 1) is an action flick, 
while their story is an emotion-propelled, realistic drama. "It's about 
what you'd do if you were told you only had a year to live," said 
director Mimi Leder, "I want the audience to walk away from this thinking 
about their own lives."
Lofty sentiments aside, "Deep Impact" is just another disaster movie, and 
an exceptionally clumsy one at that. In fact, after two hours of enduring 
the film's poorly drawn characters, insipid dialogue, and clichéd 
storylines, it's difficult not to root for the comet instead of the 
people.
There's something inherently awkward about the very notion of a comet 
collision movie. Presumably, no one wants to see humanity wiped out, but 
the whole lure of this type of film is the promise of witnessing disaster 
on a mammoth scale. It's like watching an auto race; no one wishes death 
or injury on the drivers, yet most people love to see a splashy wreck. In 
1951's "When Worlds Collide," the problem was solved by having two 
objects headed for Earth, one on a collision course and one that narrowly 
misses. An intrepid group of travelers takes off in a rocket. After Comet 
A destroys the Earth, they colonize Comet B, which just happens to have 
an oxygen atmosphere and beautiful green foliage.
"Deep Impact" isn't quite that ridiculous, but it comes close. Here, the 
president announces that Earth has a year before impact. In the interim, 
a group of astronauts will attempt to blow up the rogue rock. In case 
they fail, the government will house one million people in an underground 
shelter to begin life anew. A national lottery will be held. If your name 
is selected, you go into the shelter. If no...well, feel free to start 
smoking again.
Had the film seriously examined the societal consequences of a planet-
wide death sentence, "Deep Impact" could have meant something. Instead, 
they follow the "Cheesy Disaster Movies 101" lesson plan to the letter. 
The production hops between three storylines, none particularly inspiring.
While investigating what she believes to be a Washington sex scandal, 
plucky reporter Téa Leoni uncovers the classified information about the 
comet. Like any reputable journalist, she uses the information to strong-
arm the President and further her career. After marveling at her ease in 
cracking open the government secrets (she secures the information in 
about five minutes, using the search engine on her PC,) you can amuse 
yourself by counting the number of plugs given MSNBC, the fledgling cable 
news network. If the president was really concerned with national 
security, he should have told her to go ahead and broadcast the story on 
MSNBC, thus insuring that nobody would ever hear about it.
Storyline Two follows the astronauts as they attempt to destroy the comet.
 Robert Duvall heads up the team, which includes "Swinger's" Jon Favreau 
and TV mainstays Ron Eldard and Blair Underwood. Despite choppy editing 
in the action scenes and a contrived subplot involving the generation gap 
between Duvall and the younger astronauts, these segments carry the most 
emotional resonance, thanks to several poignant exchanges, plus solid 
acting from Duvall and company.
The third storyline is the most ludicrous, focusing on Elijah Wood, the 
kid who discovered the comet, and his girlfriend, Helen Hunt Jr. (her 
real name is Leelee Sobieski, but after one look at her, you'll 
understand.) Elijah snares a spot in the underground cavern, while Helen 
Jr. elects to stay with her parents. Will cruel fate keep the young 
lovers apart? Fat chance. Try to keep a straight face as Elijah tells his 
folks he's leaving the cavern for almost certain doom with his sweetie. 
Their response? "Well son, you take care now." 
There isn't room to cover all the howlingly bad scenes in a film that 
seems brain-dead, even by disaster movie standards. Witness President 
Morgan Freeman solemnly tell the world about the comet, urging the 
populace to stay calm while describing the pending collision in terms 
alarming enough to send nuns screaming panic-stricken into the streets. 
Watch as people outrun a thousand foot high tidal wave moving at the 
speed of sound. Gaze in amazement as Elijah takes off on an highway 
clogged with thousands of cars, finds Helen Jr. in seconds, then easily 
navigates through the traffic jam that has everyone else trapped.
All this and more awaits you in "Deep Impact," the first major 
disappointment of the summer movie season. Incidentally, those whiz bang 
special effects you've seen in the film's trailers don't happen until the 
last twenty minutes of the movie. Unless you're a connoisseur of bad 
movies, wait until this dud collides with your TV and see them then.

Review for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., 
Ryan Philippe. Directed by Jim Gillespie from Kevin Williamson's script.
Review and article by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

With teen scary movies, the most relevant consideration is the Jump 
Factor. Plot, style and character-development are all well and good, but 
audiences go to these kind of films for the same reason they visit 
haunted houses; to have someone spring out of nowhere and shout "Boo!" "I 
Know What You Did Last Summer," the latest offering from "Scream" writer 
Kevin Williamson, delivers the scares on a regular basis, including one 
"Boo!" that rates a full 10 on the Jump Scale. 
Williamson and director Jim Gillespie were determined to make "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer" more than just another slasher film. Working 
from Lois Duncans novel, they create an effective creepy mood, as four 
teens, returning home from a night of partying, hit a man with their car 
on a desolate stretch of road. Faced with possible manslaughter charges, 
they decide to dump the body into the sea and keep the tragedy a secret. 
Guilt from that night destroys their bond, and the kids stay far away 
from each other until a year later, when one of them receives a letter 
stating "I know what you did last summer." 
Set in a Carolina fishing village, "Last Summer" establishes a 
distinctive atmosphere and boasts characters better defined and far 
smarter than most in this genre. Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Party Of Five"), 
Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's "Buffy The Vampire Slayer"), Freddie Prinze 
Jr. (outstanding in "The House Of Yes"), and Ryan Philippe ("White 
Squall") are effective in the lead roles, but the most memorable 
performance comes from Anne Heche as a loved one of the victim. With an 
odd gait and even odder mannerisms, Heches disturbing character is like 
the sister of that kid with the banjo from "Deliverance." Shes a creepy 
hoot.
After a number of well-stage scenes, particularly the initial accident 
and a riotous teen beauty pageant, "Last Summer" stumbles towards the end,
 falling into far too ordinary genre clichis. Still, the film is a fun 
diversion, and never fails to shout "Boo!" at just the right moment.
"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a departure from Scream, said 
Kevin Williamson, who wrote the screenplay for both films. "Scream was 
sort of a comedy horror film, set outside of a genre that it poked fun at 
and paid tribute to, all at the same time. This film is the movie 
Scream was parodying, it sits right inside of the genre. In the wake of 
Scream, I wanted to see if a straightforward horror story could be done 
again, if a level of wit and sophistication could be brought to it and if 
we could make a really good scary movie that didnt rely on the gimmick 
of self-aware, self-reflexive pop culture references."
In "I Know What You Did Last Summer", based on Lois Duncans novel, 
tragedy strikes when four young people are driving home from a night of 
drinking on the Carolina coast. While speeding down a winding stretch of 
road, their car slams into a man. Standing over the body of the stranger, 
the youths consider the ramifications of the accident and make a fateful 
decision to dump the body into the sea and keep the nightmare a secret. 
Cut to one year later, when one of the now-scattered group receives a 
letter saying "I know what you did last summer." The situation forces the 
estranged teens to reunite, as they try to discover who is stalking them.
The film stars four hot young actors, Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Party Of 
Five"), Sarah Michelle Gellar (TVs "Buffy The Vampire Slayer"), Freddie 
Prinze Jr. ("The House Of Yes") and Ryan Phillippe ("White Squall"), but 
most of the attention at a recent press gathering in L.A. focused on 
writer Kevin Williamson. His clever script for the smash hit "Scream", 
the first horror film to break the $100 million mark domestically, 
revived the moribund genre. 
"When Scream hit we said Oh brother, everyones going to expect a 
comedy here and this film is serious. Last Summer is a morality tale 
about four kids who make a decision they think will preserve their future 
that actually destroys it. It talks about how deadly secrets are, that 
secrets can kill you. This is not a comedy."
Director Jim Gillespie agreed, adding "Its not a slasher film, really. 
Its a throwback to the Hitchcock type of thriller. I wanted to do things 
in a more subtle fashion, to let the audience use their imagination a 
little bit more. Its also a character study. Thats what draws the 
audience into the film, getting to know the kids. Everything hinges on 
the accident. Its a five minute scene and the acting is critical. If 
that scene didnt work, then nothing else would. Thankfully, I had a 
great script and four extremely talented young actors to work with."
Williamson is proud of the scripts character development, saying "I 
tried to infuse it with savvy, to keep it smart, not to give it the stick 
characters we see walking through the Friday the 13th movies."
Despite the emphasis on character development, both men recognize that 
the scare factor is crucial. Gillespie explained, "Because the film is 
character, rather than plot driven, it requires a certain number of 
scares every few minutes, otherwise you lose the attention of your 
audience. Younger audiences expect you to keep the scares coming fast.
"Its funny, with this kind of film theres always one moment that you 
think is a medium level scare and that turns out to be the biggest scare 
of all. You jump and then you resent it because its complete manipulation.
 But that manipulation is part of the fun."
Williamson is still amazed at the level of "Screams" success. "I sat 
down and said All right Kevin, stop being an artist, youre unemployed 
and starving, be a businessman. I looked around to see what was missing, 
whats wasnt happening in the film market, and decided to take a shot at 
scary movies. I wrote Scream to draw attention to itself. I thought if 
people saw it they might think I had a voice for something else. Then it 
sold. Who could have dreamed all of this would happen."
"Scream 2 opens in December and Im very proud of it. I saw the 
finished film the other day and its scarier than the first one, it rocks.
 I just hope audiences will appreciate what weve done with I Know What 
You Did Last Summer. The approach may be more traditional, but I 
guarantee this film will make you jump!"

She's coquettish. She's defiant. She's a somnolent rag doll. She's a 
fiery feminist. She's Elizabeth I of England, self-proclaimed Virgin 
Queen and star of "Elizabeth," a revisionist historical drama that 
manages to entertain and annoy all at the same time. In his first English-
language film, director Shekhar Kapur tries to satisfy the Masterpiece 
Theatre and MTV crowds simultaneously. The result is an interesting, 
often frustrating work that suffers from a case of cinematic multiple 
personality disorder. 
Cate Blanchett, so wonderful in "Oscar and Lucinda," plays the monarch 
who took the throne in 1558 and ruled England for 45 years. Emulating a 
statue of the Virgin Mary, she assumed the Virgin Queen moniker following 
a bizarre change in her physical appearance. After hours of work by her 
handmaidens, she stunned her subjects by striding out in a stylized wig 
and regal clothing, with an application of make-up turning her skin a 
stark, unearthly white. Basically, she became the 16th century equivalent 
of Michael Jackson.
The film is dripping with intrigue, as damn near everybody plots to 
either kill Elizabeth or co-opt her reign through marriage. Along the way,
 Kapur employs a variety of self-conscious stylistic tricks to give the 
film a hip feel. He's quite fond of rotation. During many sequences, if 
one character isn't circling another, the camera is circulating everybody 
(sensitive viewers may wish to bring some Dramamine). The twirling 
cinematography, as well as several fade-to-white segues, gets old fast. 
The most annoying camera gimmick comes when Elizabeth nervously prepares 
for a speech and Kapur uses quick jump-cuts to show her anxious rehearsal.
 The effect is wildly out-of-place for a historical piece, resembling the 
flubbed line outtakes that pop up during the closing credits of an 
episode of "Home Improvement." 
Why Kapur felt compelled to jazz things up is beyond me. God knows 
there's enough drama in the screenplay's Byzantine plotlines. While 
virtually every major character in the film is scheming against Elizabeth,
 the Catholic Church serves as the prime villain, with Kapur helpfully 
supplying ominous music whenever the political intrigue moves to the 
Vatican. Speaking of characters, the film boasts some very colorful ones, 
ranging from the reptilian Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) to the 
Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel), the cross-dressing brother of the King of 
France.
While the supporting players are certainly interesting, the film centers 
on only three characters. Joseph Fiennes is bland as Sir Robert Dudley, 
Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth's duplicitous lover. Much more interesting 
is royal hatchet man Sir Francis Walsingham, a dark figure who casts a 
long shadow despite limited screen time, thanks to an extremely focused 
performance from Geoffrey Rush. And then there's Elizabeth, given a 
decidedly peculiar, but mesmerizing presence by Cate Blanchett. With an 
odd combination of side glances and secret smiles, Blanchett's Elizabeth 
often seems preoccupied, as if listening to distant voices or remembering 
happier times. 
"Elizabeth" is full of lavish set pieces, violent imagery and eccentric 
personalities. The film may be messy, but it certainly held my attention. 
Ultimately, though, the story is so emotionally detached that I found it 
difficult to fully invest in the fates of the players. If Kapur had spent 
less time on jazzy camera moves and more time exploring the passion 
behind the characters' facades, "Elizabeth" might have packed the desired 
punch. As is, it comes off as merely a sterile, historically inaccurate 
period piece with way-cool visuals. 

Title
Review for Breaking the Waves (1996)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Great movies shake you up. They make demands on you, challenge your 
beliefs, force you to look at things through another person's eyes. 
"Breaking The Waves," the first English-language film from Danish 
director Lars von Trier, is transcendent filmmaking. Using a tragic love 
story as his framework, Von Trier takes an unflinching look at the chasm 
between the rational and the spiritual sides of our lives. A haunting, 
brutal fairy tale, this masterfully detailed character study is 
uncompromising and emotionally exhausting. It's a great movie.  
Set in the early 70's, the North Sea oil boom brings outsiders to a 
remote Scottish community on the Isle Of Skye. Bess (Emily Watson,) a 
"simple-minded" local, meets and falls in love with Jan (Stellan 
Skarsgaard,) a Norwegian oil-rigger. Their impending marriage disturbs 
the religious community, a group of Calvinists  whose severe 
fundamentalism makes the Amish seem like anarcists by comparison. Bess' 
determination wins out, though, and life with her new husband becomes a 
blissful journey of personal and sexual discovery for the naive young 
woman. 
Eventually, Jan has to return to the rigs, leaving a devastated Bess 
begging God to bring her husband home. When an industrial accident sends 
Jan back, paralyzed from the neck down, Bess is convinced the disaster 
was caused by her prayers. She stays by her husband's side, acutely 
depressed and desperate to atone. Then, under the influence of drugs and 
despair, Jan makes an startling request of his wife that sends her 
spinning madly on a frenzied and shocking quest of self-sacrifice in the 
name of love.
In lesser hands, this sort of story could easily have been presented as 
simple melodrama. Von Trier's vision, however, is far more expansive. 
Using a jittery, hand-held camera, he creates a feeling of immediacy. The 
grainy close-ups are intensely personal, giving the movie the look of a 
documentary. At the same time, he uses extended shots of idyllic 
psychedelic landscapes to divide the film into chapters, underlining the 
romantic side of the story.
"Breaking The Waves" is populated by a host of memorable individuals, but 
the remarkable character of Bess is the center of the film. Because she 
is "not right in the head," her family treats her with benign 
condescension. Jan, however, views her as a miracle, and his wife 
blossoms in this new phase of her life. As Bess, Emily Watson gives a 
breathtaking, remarkably evocative performance. Shortly after their 
wedding, Jan lies naked in front of his bride. Bess, a virgin who most 
likely has never seen a nude man before, studies his body carefully. In a 
matter of seconds, her face registers surprise, amusement, fear, awe and 
lust. It's a wonderful scene and a tour de force for Watson. 
Bess is an avid churchgoer, but her approach is wildly different from 
that of the righteous townsfolk. They trudge through their days with grim 
faces. For them, life is endurance, a dour investment for an eventual 
payoff in the hereafter. Bess, however, is full of wonder, doubt, joy and 
fear. She talks with God routinely, working through dilemmas by 
verbalizing both sides of the conversation, using a childlike voice for 
herself and a stern one for God. Again, Watson plays these scenes 
superbly, providing delicate shades of character without overdoing it. 
As Bess' spiritual guilt increases, and her actions become more desperate 
and erratic, you may think you have her, and the whole movie, figured out.
 I certainly did. But, at the last moment, von Trier throws in an amazing 
and totally unexpected scene. I won't elaborate, except to say you will 
leave the theater reevaluating everything you thought during the film's 
156 minutes. The scene is an epiphany for a film that was already 
stunning. Von Trier refers to "Breaking The Waves" as "undismissable." He 
is absolutely right.

Call it "Happy Gilmore Meets the Bad News Bears" or "Billy Madison Opens 
Up a Big Ole Can of Whup Ass." Either way, you get the idea: Adam Sandler 
is back and he's up to his old tricks again, with yet another broad 
comedy starring a culturally-arrested adult with violent tendencies. Hard-
core Sandler fans will cheer his antics and the up-with-people storyline, 
while everyone else will wonder why he keeps cranking out variations of 
the same movie.
Now Adam Sandler is no dummy (though he plays one onscreen) and he knows 
what elements are required to satisfy the target audience for a film like 
this. His story introduces a lovable loser, simple-minded Cajun Mama's 
boy, Bobby Boucher. Athletes love picking on the childlike waterboy until 
they discover his formidable skills as a tackle. Everybody loves an 
underdog, so the tale pits Bobby and a sad-sack football team with a 
neurotic coach against a bunch of overgrown, self-satisfied bullies, led 
by former "Smokey and The Bandit" second banana Jerry Reed. As if that 
wasn't enough, Sandler further loads the deck by making Bobby's home life 
equally oppressive, with the kid's ferociously smothering mother (Kathy 
Bates) deeming everything from young ladies to Dick Clark as tools of the 
devil. 
Add a sexy girl (Fairuza Balk), a Nick-At-Night co-star (Henry Winkler, 
leaving the Fonz behind to play a timid coach), loads of cameos by 
celebrities playing themselves (Lee Corso, Bill Cowher, Dan Fouts, Chris 
Fowler, Jimmy Johnson, Brent Musburger, Dan Patrick, Lynn Swann and 
Lawrence Taylor), the requisite surprise appearance from a "Saturday 
Night Live" alumnus (Rob Schneider), a feel-good plot, plus well-staged 
slapstick out the wahzoo, and you've got yourself a surefire moneymaker. 
The only thing missing is even the vaguest hint of an original idea.
The explanation for Sandler's artistic rut may lie with his creative team.
 One of the film's producers is Jack Giarraputo, a college buddy of 
Sandler's. "Waterboy" director Frank Coraci was another college pal, and 
Sandler co-wrote the story with former college roomie Tim Herlihy. 
Sandler states that the group, also responsible for three of his other 
films, creates a comfortable environment, explaining "I like working with 
people I've seen in just a towel."
That's a good line, and "The Waterboy" has quite a few genuinely funny 
moments. The slapstick works more often than not, there are some great 
sight gags, and a number of strong one-liners (one crack-related joke 
works on two levels, due to the recent headline-making substance abuse 
problems of the man who delivers the line). But despite the laughs, this 
is a tired production. There is nothing wrong with low-brow humor, but 
Sandler and his frat-house friends have done the infant-in-an-adult-body 
shtick to death. To paraphrase Danny Glover (from all four "Lethal 
Weapon" movies), aren't they getting too old for this shit?
A film like this wouldn't be quite as frustrating were it not for 
Sandler's breakthrough performance in "The Wedding Singer." In that hit 
comedy, Sandler proved he could charm a wide audience, hold his own as a 
romantic lead and even play an actual adult, all without sacrificing his 
trademark style. After enjoying his winning turn in "The Wedding Singer," 
it's hard to watch him climb back into the playpen.
The cast of "The Waterboy" is varied, to say the least. Kathy Bates has a 
whale of a good time playing Bobby's Louisiana swamp mama and her 
performance, cartoonish as it may be, is one you won't soon forget. As a 
dangerous young woman smitten with Bobby, Fairuza Balk is terrific, 
projecting confidence, charisma and an edgy trailer-park sexuality. Henry 
Winkler has a certain odd charm as Bobby's whipped-puppy mentor, while 
Jerry Reed haplessly blusters as the chief villain of the movie. 
As is his norm, Sandler peppers the story with some really strange minor 
players. Clint Howard, Opie's little brother, leaves a greasy impression 
as a fanatical redneck football fan, and Rob Schneider somehow manages to 
be filthy and smarmy simultaneously as a hillbilly booster. Other 
eccentrics include Robert Kokol as a Kentucky-Fried windbag professor and 
Blake Clark as assistant coach Farmer Fran, whose incomprehensible Cajun 
mutterings is a running gag that might have been funny, had we not seen 
the same joke 24 years ago in "Blazing Saddles."
But, of course, that brings us back to "The Waterboy's" central problem. 
We've seen this all before, at least twice by Sandler and his pals, and 
countless times by other "Saturday Night Live" graduates. Speaking of 
graduating, perhaps it's time for Adam Sandler to graduate; from the 
comforting sameness of his college roomie production team and from 
reworking the same movie over and over. Hopefully Sandler will look at 
"The Wedding Singer" as one small step, and his next movie as one giant 
leap to a new level of more sophisticated comedic filmmaking.

In movieland, January is known for two things. First, viewers get to
see those prestige films that opened exclusively in NYC and LA in
December to qualify for the Academy Awards. Second, the studios use
the month to burn off those action flicks and comedies deemed too weak
to make the grade during the competitive holiday season. "Play It to
the Bone" fits squarely in the latter category. Even though the movie
boasts a well-known cast and a writer/director with a great track
record, it suffers from a meandering, anemic screenplay and ungainly
structure. This is the kind of film best enjoyed on cable or video,
where you can lay on the couch and appreciate its pleasures without
sacrificing the time and money for a trip to the theater.
The storyline is the basic stuff of most sports movies. Following the
death of two middleweight fighters, boxing promoter Joe Domino (Tom
Sizemore) must find last minute substitutes to fill the opening card
for a high profile Mike Tyson match. He contacts Cesar Dominguez
(Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson), ex-contenders
who now eke out a living as sparring partners in a sleazy LA gym, and
offers $50,000 to each man, with the promise that the winner will get
a shot at the middleweight championship.
With visions of success and fame dancing through their heads, the best
friends convince Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), who has been
romantically involved with both men, to give them a ride to Las
Vegas. And so the three hop in her lime-green 1972 Olds convertible
and leave for the big match, taking the "scenic route" to pad out the
movie.
The bulk of "Play It to the Bone" is a road story and it's a long
drive. Writer/director Ron Shelton, known for finely drawn
examinations of the relationship dynamics between athletes ("Bull
Durham," "White Men Can't Jump," "Tin Cup"), creates some sparkling
moments, but not enough to keep the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas
from becoming tedious. When the guys finally square off in the ring,
the film kicks into high gear, with dynamic play by play scenes that
pack a visceral wallop. But then Shelton spoils things with a cop-out
denouement that leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson do admirable work fleshing out
their characters. Using an uncharacteristically simplistic sit-com
mentality, Shelton gives each man one major personality quirk to make
him more colorful. Banderas' Cesar casually mentions that, after
losing a match to a gay boxer, he "tried being a fag for about a
year," in the superstitious hope of capturing the winning spirit of
his victor. Harrelson's Vince is an unfocused born-again Christian and
reacts to his friend's revelation with disgust, fueling numerous
arguments between the two.
Banderas is good in his most challenging English language role to
date. He paints Cesar as a none-too-bright, extremely likable man
whose machismo is neatly balanced by his gentle, childlike side. His
openness concerning his sexual confusion is refreshing and adds to the
charm of the character. Although playing an ornery redneck is nothing
new for Harrelson, he still acquits himself nicely, although, with
each new film, the rabid dog gleam in his eye becomes a bit more
pronounced, pulling him further and further away from that sweet,
innocent bartender I loved so much on "Cheers."
In the middle of the mix is Grace, who plays mind games with both men
to juice them up for the match. Easily smarter than both guys put
together, Grace knows just what to say to ratchet up the tension
level, and Lolita Davidovich deftly adds layers of vitality and heart
to her thinly-written character. "Ally McBeal's" Lucy Liu pops up
briefly as a fiery hitchhiker. Liu is clearly intended to increase the
sizzle within the trio, but comes off more as just another way for
Shelton to kill time before the trio arrives in Las Vegas.
Why he felt the need to stretch out the road trip is beyond me. To be
sure, for the climactic boxing match to have sufficient dramatic
impact, we need time to get to know the players, but devoting
two-thirds of the movie to the journey is absurd. After a while, I
felt like a kid sitting in the back seat of the convertible, bouncing
up and down while pleading "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" Once
we do arrive, Banderas and Harrelson are so entertaining in their
exhaustive big bout (complete with some very funny hallucinations)
that the main question becomes "was that trip really necessary?" Had
Ron Shelton pared about 30 minutes off the drive, the answer might
have been "Yes."

One of the best things about my job is that, every so often, a film
still catches me by surprise. "Spy Kids" certainly did. An adventure
story aimed primarily at children, the movie is smart, zippy fun. The
production neither panders nor talks down to its audience. The brother
and sister at the center of the tale are believable, likable kids and
their parents are  get ready for this  intelligent, capable and
loving. Bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged
action scenes avoid excessive violence. What a relief it is to be able
to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics.
Consider the other PG rated "family friendly" movie in theaters now.
"See Spot Run" has a mother going out of town, leaving her son with an
idiot neighbor. Body function humor abounds, including a slapstick bit
that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop. What really
disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film. The story begins with a
police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in
the process. At the hospital, the doctors explain that they replaced the
testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog
didn't bit off the other one, because two metal replacement balls would
clack together. Of course, the movie ends with the dog biting off the
remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he
clacks past their cells. Somebody clue me in  when did genital
mutilation become funny?
"Spy Kids" is a welcome antidote to the repellent "See Spot Run," using
imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness. Carmen (Alexa Vega) and
her younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) live in a beautiful seaside home
with their parents, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla
Gugino). Mom and Dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children. What
the kids don't know is that they are also former spies. Once agents from
different countries assigned to "erase" each other, they instead fell in
love, married and retired to raise a family.
Needless to say, they get drawn back to the business. Shortly into their
first joint mission, they are captured and end up in the headquarters of
Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), a foppish hybrid of Willy Wonka and Pee Wee
Herman who hosts Juni's favorite TV show. But there is evil behind the
scenes, as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children.
Papa Gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the
efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get
it from him.
Back at home, "Uncle" Felix (Cheech Marin) shows up to reveal Mom and
Dad's secret to the kids. After a brief respite at a safe house filled
with enough cool gadgets for a dozen Sharper Image stores, Carmen and
Juni set off to find their parents and save the world, zooming through
the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish, while a slew of
wicked people (including Teri Hatcher) chase them.
During the course of their adventures, they get to use jet packs,
electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses. They watch as
secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with Silly Putty
faces and used as background characters on Floop's TV show. They deal
with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms, legs and heads would
normally be (Why are the guards so ineffective? Because they're all
thumbs!) They move from one colorful locale to another, including a
nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from "Star Trek."
The storyline is silly and convoluted, but even at its most dense, it is
easier to follow than either "Mission: Impossible" movie.
Director Robert Rodriguez ("From Dusk to Dawn") maintains a frenetic
pace, with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes. A bit less
action and a little more character development would have been nice, but
he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully
invested in the family. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara make an agreeable
brother and sister team, squabbling the way kids do, but coming together
when it counts. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are even better as the
parents; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry
while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes.
Even the usually irritating Alan Cumming has some nice moments  a
virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and Juni is one of the
best segments in the film.
Had Rodriguez added a few more scenes like that, I would have enjoyed
the film more (and I definitely could have lived without the glaring
product placement for a certain Mc-ubiquitous company). Regardless, "Spy
Kids" is a hoot, offering fun for adults and children alike. And just
think, they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle.

If you plan to see "The Mummy," there are a few things you should 
know. First, although loosely based on the well-known monster movie, 
it's not particularly scary. Instead of trying to frighten us, the 
filmmakers elected to make an "Indiana Jones" style adventure tale. 
Second, as an "Indiana Jones" derivative, it's not particularly 
involving. The story takes forever to get rolling and the convoluted 
plot serves mostly as an excuse to whip out loads of flashy special 
effects. Third, some of those effects are nifty, but few are 
convincing and too many are simply cheesy. Fourth, most of the jokes 
aren't funny. Apparently realizing their creation was structurally 
unsound, the filmmakers attempt to distract viewers with an endless 
stream of wisecracks from the principal characters. Wrapping things 
up (ahem), I suggest you skip "The Mummy." 
The plot goes like this. In the mid-1920s, a plucky librarian (Rachel 
Weisz) reluctantly hires a ne'er-do-well adventurer (Brendan Fraser) 
to search for ruins of the ancient Egyptian city Hamunaptra, buried 
deep in the desert. They travel the Nile along with a competing team 
of cowboys bent on plundering the treasures of Hamunaptra. Once in 
the city, an unusually nasty mummy called Imhotep is accidentally 
raised from the dead by the cowpokes. The cranky 3,000-year-old 
immediately begins snagging body parts from those who released him, 
hoping to reconstitute his body so that he can unleash plagues on 
Egypt and bring his girlfriend back to life, presumably to rule the 
world at his side. And you thought Bill Clinton was a contemporary 
phenomenon.
"The Mummy" could have worked as a horror story, an adventure tale, 
or even a spoof, but writer-director Stephen Sommers ("Deep Rising") 
stumbles by haplessly trying to combine all three. While taking crib 
notes from the "Indiana Jones" movies, he should have studied more 
carefully, because he makes some fundamental errors here.
To succeed, films of this genre require a memorable villain. "The 
Mummy" starts with one, but undermines its effectiveness through bad 
writing. Even in the most dire circumstances, the lead characters 
continue trading one-liners as if they were playing flag football on 
a Sunday afternoon instead of facing death from a supernatural 
malevolent creature - - if they don't take the monster seriously, why 
should we? 
Fraser and Weisz spend so much time swapping comedic insults that 
they come off like a road company version of Sam and Diane from 
"Cheers." They are lightweights; two crazy kids on a madcap escapade. 
Brendan Fraser is a talented actor, but the script cripples his 
character, casting him as an enterprising puppy dog instead of a real 
swashbuckler. As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford tossed off his share of 
caustic remarks, but he clearly recognized his opponents as genuine 
menaces. Fraser's character seems more like a big kid on nitrous 
oxide during a marathon paintball tournament.
The impact of the storyline is also lessened by the way the 
characters deal with death. A large number of cast members die 
gruesomely, but their friends show virtually no emotional reaction. 
Only once in the entire movie does anyone pause to display a moment 
of regret that a friend has been killed. 
After a while, my investment in the storyline disappeared completely 
and I just sat back and watched the special effects while waiting for 
the overlong film to end. "The Mummy" overflows with computer 
generated images of varying degrees of originality and quality. A 
prologue in ancient Egypt shows a lavish rendering of Hamunaptra in 
its prime, but the backgrounds are chintzy matte paintings and the 
computer renderings have that overly creamy look, similar to the CGI 
films shown in motion simulator rides. 
Later, flesh-eating bugs create some minor scares, although they too 
have the same cut-rate CGI appearance. Images of faces mystically 
appearing in sandstorms are more effective and shots of freshly 
revived mummies, while reminiscent of the skeletal version of the 
"Terminator," are nicely rendered. But effects do not a movie make 
and all the flashy imagery in "The Mummy" can't compensate for its 
soulless feel. 
The few scenes I enjoyed featured Bernard Fox, Dr. Bombay from the 
old "Bewitched" TV series, as a dotty soldier of fortune. I had no 
idea the veteran actor was still alive and his blustery performance 
was a pleasure. In just a few minutes of screen time, he showed more 
personality than the rest of the cast combined.
In his review of "The Mummy," Roger Ebert gave the film three out of 
four stars, acknowledging that it was trash, but arguing that it was 
enjoyable trash. I understand the sentiment, but his choice surprises 
me. If I'm in the mood for a so-bad-that-it's-good movie, I'll seek 
out something memorably awful, like "Roadhouse" or "Showgirls." "The 
Mummy" isn't bad enough to make my guilty pleasure list. It's merely 
one more overblown exercise in big budget lameness.

Once in a while, a movie will strike just the right emotional chord in
me and, for a time, I stop being a critic. Instead of studying the
various elements of the production or analyzing the subtext, I just
settle back in my seat and enjoy. "Trick" is one of those films. Sweet
and sexy, this gentle little romantic comedy boasts two lead
performances so charming that I simply didn't care to look for
problems in the film.
A number of other critics did not share my feelings. Many dismissed
"Trick" as superficial fluff and, despite giving it two out of four
stars, Roger Ebert seemed to take particular delight in shredding the
movie. On the other hand, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman
awarded "Trick" an A- and Reel Views' James Berardinelli also offered
strong praise. How nice to see that at least a few writers saw the
same film I did.
Set in the Chelsea and West Village sections of New York City, "Trick"
takes place over the course of one day in the life of Gabriel
(Christian Campbell, Neve's brother), a songwriter with Broadway
aspirations. Gabriel is your basic All-American gay twenty-something,
perpetually sporting a smile on his wholesome, dimpled
face. Unfortunately, he is also a walking doormat. A textbook
people-pleaser, he allows his best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling) to
monopolize conversations with her self-obsessed babbling and routinely
vacates his apartment so that his straight roommate Rich (Brad Beyer)
can entertain lady friends, even if it means sleeping overnight in the
hall.
On the evening when Rich's "official" girlfriend is due to return from
a long stay in France, Gabriel kills time by bar hopping. During a
stop at a strip club, he spies Mark (John Paul Pitoc), a drop-dead
handsome go-go boy with piercing eyes, a phenomenal body and an
equally impressive basket (his nickname is "Beer Can" and it has
nothing to do with drinking).
Later, Gabriel encounters Mark on the subway and they briefly make eye
contact. When he exits, Mark follows and abruptly asks Gabriel if he
has a place where they can get together. And so the adventure begins,
as the guys encounter a series of colorful (and often maddening)
people on their quest for a bed.
Jason Schafer's screenplay runs the pair through a sociological
obstacle course, and along the way, their intended one-night stand
turns into something more, with the two young men getting to know each
other as individuals instead of attractive tricks. Affection begins to
blossom, building towards a closing scene as romantic as any I've seen
in a very long time.
It all works because of the chemistry between Gabriel and Mark, and
the considerable talents of Christian Campbell and John Paul
Pitoc. Campbell is good-looking in a fresh-scrubbed, Midwest way, and
he paints Gabriel as a likable man with a slightly nebbish quality
reminiscent of Jonathan Silverman back in his Neil Simon days. Beneath
Gabriel's polite, pleasant demeanor lies an insecure, body-conscious
kid who intensely fears rejection.
John Paul Pitoc is even more impressive. He gives a remarkably subtle
performance, ever so gradually revealing Mark's depth of
character. Initially, Mark appears to merely be a stoic hunk with a
blunt presentation style, but as the night progresses, he reveals his
kind, compassionate nature. In a particularly nice scene, he hops in
to help one of Gabriel's buddies save face with an ex-boyfriend.
Anyone attending "Trick" hoping for steamy sex scenes is in for a
disappointment. While the film is certainly erotic, the emphasis is on
courtship, trust and the beginning of intimacy rather than romping in
the sack. This is a film where hand-holding is electric and a simple
kiss feels like pure magic. The trappings may be contemporary, but at
its core, this is the kind of heartfelt romance rarely seen anymore.
Structurally, it is essential that circumstances keep Gabriel and Mark
from finding a bed and the supporting cast, particularly Tori
Spelling, energetically provides the circumstances. Spelling is
convincing (perhaps too convincing) as a pushy actress and singer who
is not nearly as talented as she thinks she is. Midway through the
film, the guys run into a tactless, overbearing drag queen who looks a
lot like a ravaged version of Spelling. I doubt the resemblance was
coincidental.
Even in my non-critical mood, I must admit that some of the plot
devices proved tiresome, but the central story between Gabriel and
Mark was so delightful that the flaws were easy to forgive. Does
"Trick" have problems? Sure, but those in the mood for a newfangled
spin on old-fashioned romance will find this a sweet and satisfying
confection.

Cats and dogs are both intelligent, well-organized species that talk. A
secret war between them has been going on for over a thousand years. In
ancient Egypt, cruel feline overlords herded their human slaves around
like cattle, until an army of canines came to our rescue, thereafter
acting as benign guardians of mankind.
At least that's the way the dogs tell it.
Why, you may ask, don't we remember such a momentous historical event?
According to one pooch, the answer is simple. "Humans are primitive," he
explains to a pup. "They can't sense earthquakes, they can't smell fear
and they won't accept responsibility for their own farts."
"Cats and Dogs" is a raucous comedy based on a genuinely inventive
concept. Kids, I suspect, will love the movie and most adults will find
it moderately entertaining. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's
frustrating to see such a promising undertaking fail to realize its full
potential. The problem is that the screenplay was written for children,
with scattered bits thrown in for adults, even though the premise
screams for a multilayered approach. With another rewrite or two, "Cats
and Dogs" could have kept the adults laughing as hard as the children.
I'm convinced the authors were up to the task. Anyone capable of having
an angry dog shout, "Son of my mom!" could surely have pulled it off.
Still, there are treats to be had, beginning with the storyline. An
uneasy, but long-standing truce between cats and dogs breaks down due to
a megalomaniacal feline and a preoccupied human scientist. Professor
Brody (Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of a major breakthrough: a simple
formula that will immunize mankind against all dog allergies. If
successful, the balance of power between the two four legged species
would shift. For the power-mad tabby Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes),
the situation offers him a golden opportunity  if he can destroy the
formula and infect man with a substance that will increase dog
allergies, he can RULE THE WORLD!
The dogs will have none of this, of course, so they make arrangements to
place one of their top agents in the Brody household. But a mistake
happens and, instead of the James Bond of pooches, the new Brody "pet"
turns out to be a wet-behind-the-floppy-ears pup named Lou (Tobey
Maguire).
And so the battle begins. The dogs work undercover to bring Lou up to
snuff, with an embittered veteran named Butch (Alec Baldwin) heading up
a team including Sam (Michael Clarke Duncan), Peek (Joe Pantoliano) and,
to the discomfort of Butch, Ivy (Susan Sarandon), an ex-lover who knows
him all too well. Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles sets his master plan in motion.
I won't reveal the specifics; suffice to say it involves threats,
kidnapping, deception on a grand scale, and ninja cats.
For the most part, the special effects are convincing. Computer
animation is employed to make the animals appear to speak and change
facial expressions, with animatronic puppets used for scenes requiring
unusual physical adroitness. The CGI is quite well-done and, more often
than not, the puppetry works. But hoo-boy, when it doesn't  those
critters look like Muppets being struck by lightning.
As with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," the actors playing non-humans
are far more credible, and likable, than the "real" people. On the dog
side, Tobey Maguire gives Lou the right mix of naiveté and brashness,
Susan Sarandon is wise and smoky as Ivy and Alec Baldwin does fine work
essentially re-playing his character from "Pearl Harbor" (only with
better dialogue). In Cat Land, Jon Lovitz is fine as a surly assistant
and, in the key role of Mr. Tinkles, Sean Hayes provides the appropriate
grandiose tones for the would-be kitty Napoleon.
Oh, but when the humans take center stage, the film devolves into a
carbon copy of one of those wretched live-action Disney family comedies
from the '60s. Alexander Pollock is bland as son Scott and Elizabeth
Perkins is even blander as Mrs. Brody, an ineffective nurturer who
spends most of the movie fretting. As wacky scientist/lousy father
Professor Brody, Jeff Goldblum is simply embarrassing, slathering his
patented stammer over the walking stereotype.
If "Cats and Dogs" is successful enough to warrant a sequel, I have a
couple of suggestions for the filmmakers. First, take your time and
write more jokes for the grown-ups. Second, if a maniacal cat threatens
to kill the Brody family, let him.

TV ads for "Hannibal," the follow-up to "The Silence of the Lambs,"
begin with the statement, "For 10 years you've been waiting for him to
return." I don't know about you, but I wasn't. "Silence" is a terrific
movie and Anthony Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter remains one of the most
chilling villains ever to appear on the big screen. In his 30 scant
minutes of screen time, the erudite cannibal with the feral eyes and
spring-coiled calm demeanor left an unforgettable impression, from his
crackling "quid pro quo" exchanges with FBI agent Clarice Starling to
the horrific moment when the beast finally pounced.
The film ended perfectly, with the escaped doctor phoning Clarice and
delivering the classic line, "I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm
having an old friend for dinner." And that was that. The story was over,
with a thoroughly satisfying resolution. Not once during the next decade
did I wonder what happened to Hannibal or Clarice later.
Clearly, somebody did. Jodie Foster, who was so remarkable as Clarice,
and "Silence" director Jonathan Demme both passed on the adaptation of
Thomas Harris' controversial novel, but Anthony Hopkins signed on the
dotted line and Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter was reborn. Incidentally,
plans for yet another film are already underway. Who knows where it all
will end? Perhaps with a TV series. I can hear the promos now: "When
college student Jack McGee became the live-in caretaker at a mansion
owned by a reclusive art historian, little did he know that his new
roomie would be a cultured serial killer with a taste for human flesh!
Take a bite of comic mayhem with 'My Dinners with Hannibal,' starring
Jimmy Fallon as Jack and Eddie Izzard as the dreadful Dr. H! Coming this
fall to the WB!"
"Hannibal" is an extremely disappointing movie that dilutes the impact
of Hannibal Lecter while turning Clarice Starling (now played by
Julianne Moore) into a marginal character. Dense and dull, it plods
along, enlivened by periodic displays of gore-porn. Viewers get to see a
man's face sliced off (the flesh is fed to dogs), a police officer
gutted and several people eaten alive by wild boars. The most disgusting
visual is saved for the end. I won't reveal it here. Suffice to say it
manages to be repellent and idiotic at the same time.
That scene, by the way, is a textbook example of how to destroy viewer
tension. Director Ridley Scott starts it stylishly, teasing the audience
with glimpses of the victim as the villain hovers nearby. The suspense
and sense of creepiness builds slowly and steadily, only to be blown by
one long, disastrous full-head image of something happening to an actor
that would be lethal in real life. By lingering on a shot of the
impossible, Scott shatters the illusion. Up until that moment, I watched
with horror as the villain prepared to perform an unspeakable act on a
helpless victim. But when the filmmaker cut to the full head image, I
was jerked out of the fantasy. Instead of being caught up in the
fiction, I found myself studying the FX. A director as talented as
Ridley Scott should know that the image dictated by the script could
only be effectively presented with brief looks from a variety of angles.
The mentality behind the shot is just one of many bad ideas connected
with "Hannibal." Taking a character as rich as Clarice Starling and
making her a flat supporting player is another. Perhaps the worst idea
is trying to turn Hannibal Lecter from the bogeyman into an antihero.
The screenplay stresses that Dr. Lecter prefers to only kill rude
people, as if that is a positive character trait. Producer Dino De
Laurentiis echoed this dumb-ass mindset, claiming that audiences have
conferred hero status on the character, then adding "When he's forced to
kill, he kills somebody the audience wants to kill too."
Bear in mind, this is from the same guy who thought his remake of "King
Kong" was better than the original. But Julianne Moore, who has always
seemed well-balanced, apparently agrees. "He is the monster everyone
wishes they could be," she told Entertainment Weekly.
What the hell is wrong with these people?
I haven't said much about the plot of "Hannibal" because there isn't
much to it. Despite being one of the most notorious serial killers on
Earth, Lecter strolls casually around upper crust Florence, Italy. In
the book, he had plastic surgery done, but the filmmakers obviously
decided, "Aw, screw it." Back in America, his one surviving victim (Gary
Oldman, uncredited and unrecognizable beneath heavy makeup) plots to
capture and kill Lecter. Clarice gets involved, yadda yadda yadda. The
photography is lush and the music florid. Moore does what she can with
her stunted character, while Hopkins rolls his vowels excessively. None
of which matters, of course. All the flourishes in the world can't
disguise the fact that "Hannibal" is just a geek show with delusions of
grandeur. If you're in the mood for gore, rent "Night of the Living
Dead," a far more frightening, entertaining and honest movie than this
pretentious drivel.

Review for Air Force One (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Its hard to imagine anyone better suited to play the President Of The 
United States Of America than Harrison Ford. Early in "Air Force One", he 
delivers a speech about human rights violations and says, "Never again 
will I allow political self-interest to deter us from doing what is 
morally right." With a fiercely determined look on his face, he addresses 
terrorists around the world, saying "We will no longer be afraid. Its 
your turn to be afraid." Ford delivers the speech perfectly, establishing 
President James Marshall as a man of great integrity, courage and moral 
resolve, the kind of President we all wish we could have. 
The combination of extremely well-detailed lead characters and a 
constantly escalating sense of tension is what makes "Air Force One" 
succeed. Director Wolfgang Petersen ("In The Line Of Fire", "Outbreak") 
is very good at creating winning action/thrillers out of preposterous 
scripts. "Air Force One" has holes in logic large enough to fly a plane 
through, but Petersen spins the tale so well that ultimately, it doesnt 
matter. 
"Air Force One" is "Die Hard" on an airplane, following that films 
formula completely. As in "Die Hard", a deranged mastermind (Gary Oldman) 
and his thugs take a group of people hostage in a confined space (the 
Presidential plane, Air Force One). Our hero (Ford) hides in the bowels 
of the confined area, gets his bearings, then begins picking off the bad 
guys one at a time, enraging the mastermind even more. While trying to 
save the day, our hero establishes a link with an cohort on the outside 
(Vice-president Glenn Close by cell phone), who offers assistance and 
moral support. Of course, despite all outside aide, ultimate victory can 
only be achieved if our hero, assisted by his courageous fellow hostages, 
manages to personally kick the crap out of the deranged mastermind.
Of the many "Die Hard" clones, "Air Force One" works far better than most,
 because Petersen understands the importance of the human equation. He 
firmly establishes the character of President Marshall and his strong 
relationship with his wife and daughter, then pulls the rug out from 
under these characters lives. Its disturbing watching the President 
getting beat up by thugs, because we know and respect the man and the 
office he represents. Likewise, when members of the Presidents staff are 
killed, their deaths actually register emotionally, as opposed to most 
films, where the body counts feel incidental.
Petersen also understands that a "Die Hard" clone cannot work without a 
memorable villain, and Gary Oldman does the job nicely. Oldman plays Ivan 
Korshunov, a zealot obsessed with his goal of restoring a fanatical 
military dictator to power and destroying the evil he believes America 
represents. Oldmans eyes glisten with psychotic passion as he rants and 
threatens those around him. Again, the human factor is established as he 
talks about his family while his expression softens momentarily. One 
scene, where Korshunov leans over and kisses the Presidents daughter on 
the forehead, is especially chilling because the motive of his gesture is 
unclear. Did he kiss the child because she touched a memory of his own 
children or was the kiss an act of subtle terrorism, reminding the First 
Family of his absolute power over whether they live or die? Oldmans 
accent is sometimes shaky, but his performance is powerful.
The supporting cast does the best they can. Glenn Close is credible as 
the extremely focused Vice-president. Unfortunately, Vice-presidents 
generally dont have much to do, and sadly, neither does Close. Dean 
Stockwell is effective as the Defense secretary, who attempts to use the 
nightmarish situation for a political power play.
The special effects in "Air Force One" range from seamless to pretty bad. 
A computer-generated aircraft crash looks particularly phony. Computer 
graphics, trumpeted as the means towards visualizing the impossible, all 
too often look merely like overly sleek overlays. For every great 
computer-generated scene, like those of Shep, the elephant who thinks 
hes a dog in "George Of The Jungle", we have to suffer through scenes 
like the plane crash in "Air Force One", which resembles one of those 
cheesy visuals presented in motion-simulators at amusement parks.
The pacing of "Air Force One" lags a bit towards the end, largely because 
the film has no less than three obvious endings, but enough nit-picking. 
The bottom line is that "Air Force One" works. Wolfgang Petersen may have 
ripped off "Die Hard", but he did his work extremely well. Thanks to his 
expertise and exceptional work from Harrison Ford, "Air Force One" 
emerges as one of the summers most thrilling escapist films.

Because the press screening of "Planet of the Apes" was one day past
last issue's deadline, I was afforded the opportunity to see the film a
second time, listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews
before writing this piece. The chief complaints of those who disliked
the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals
instead of substance, that the story was thin, that Mark Wahlberg's
character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked.
To those people I would like to say  What the hell did you expect?
This is a Tim Burton movie, boys and girls. Tim Burton movies have great
art direction and thin, clunky stories. For the blissfully nasty,
disjointed and underrated "Mars Attacks!" (Jonathan Rosenbaum of the
Chicago Reader and I were two of the only critics in America to praise
the movie) Burton reportedly tossed vintage "Mars Attacks!" trading
cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face
up.
Burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a
planet where apes rule men looks great. The apes, courtesy of make-up
magician Rick Baker, are dazzling and Ape City is a wonder to behold.
Like astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg), the film hits the ground
running, whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid
one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust
that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come
later.
As for Wahlberg, consider what Burton does with his character. From his
start as a filmmaker, Burton has shown his fascination with colorful
misfits (Pee-Wee Herman, The Joker, Ed Wood, the ack-acking Martians,
etc.) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes. So Leo Davidson
spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him
before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders. As
for lack of color, remember, Leo only launches into space to get his
monkey back. He doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for
romance from a pretty, but dull human (Estella Warren) or a dynamic ape
(Helena Bonham Carter, terrific as an equal-rights activist). As a man
who just wants out, Wahlberg is focused, subtle and sly.
The surprise ending provides the requisite shock (and some more dandy
visuals, particularly of the approaching authority figures), but
admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original. For
the original ending to work, we only had to make one simple connection,
for this one, we have to write a whole new screenplay.
The 1968 "Apes" boasted a handful of great scenes, cool looking monkeys,
a deliciously hammy performance by Charlton Heston (who appears
uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed, re-delivering a
classic line) and a killer ending. But viewers had to suffer through
numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages
delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball. The 2001 "Planet of the
Apes" offers a different set of great scenes, much cooler looking
monkeys, fine acting from Wahlberg, Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti and Tim
Roth, and a not so good ending. It also gives us another chance to
experience the skewed vision of Tim Burton and that's nothing to
complain about.

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)
Amistad (1997)
Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman, 
Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Steven Spielberg. 145 minutes.
Rated R, 2.5 stars (out of 5 stars)
In 1839, 53 Africans, held under horrific conditions on the Spanish slave 
ship La Amistad, broke free and killed most of the crew. They tried to 
force two survivors to take them home, but the ship was captured and the 
Africans found themselves in America, imprisoned again and embroiled in a 
massive legal battle, with ramifications far beyond their particular case.
 The story of these Africans is important and needed to be told. It's a 
shame Steven Spielberg does such a poor job telling it.
"Amistad" is a maddening film because it comes so close to greatness. To 
be sure, there are magnificent scenes, particularly the opening of the 
movie, depicting the revolt on the ship. The segment is dark, brutal and 
thrilling, mesmerizing because it taps into the fundamental nature of the 
human condition, that desperate need for life and freedom. Unfortunately, 
for most of the movie Spielberg inexplicably takes an academic approach 
to slavery, reducing the Africans to noble props in a series of extremely 
tired courtroom scenes. Instead of looking into the personalities of the 
Africans and the psychology of slavery, we watch stuffy white guys in 
silly outfits debating the legal minutiae of the issue.
Matthew McConaughey plays the lawyer for the Africans. In granny glasses 
and curls, he looks like a frat boy in a college play, and his unfocused 
performance adds little to the movie. Morgan Freeman fares better as a 
former slave turned abolitionist, but he isn't given much to do. Anthony 
Hopkins, however, gets loads of screen time as former President John 
Quincy Adams, reluctantly drawn into the case. Hopkins gives a bizarre 
performance, shuffling about while alternating between mumbling and 
bellowing at those around him. In early scenes, he appears to be quite 
senile, but later in the film, he miraculously recovers enough to give a 
long, ponderous speech to the Supreme Court. 
The only African we get to know is Cinque, beautifully played by Djimon 
Hounsou. The actor is remarkably expressive, creating the only fully-
realized African character. Cinque is a leader who believes himself 
unworthy to lead. His doubts, confusion, defiance and bravery give us the 
human connection the film so desperately needs.
In the magnificent "Schindler's List," Spielberg showed uncharacteristic 
restraint, allowing the audience to react to the story naturally. Here, 
he reverts to the emotional manipulation he used in films like "E.T.," 
with John William's overbearing musical score constantly telegraphing 
what Spielberg expects us to feel. Every moment of the film is 
choreographed in glossy Hollywood fashion. Even a scene depicting the 
Africans' nightmarish life on the slave ship, an extremely powerful 
segment, loses some of its impact because Spielberg can't resist 
orchestrating every second, using oh-so-perfect lighting and "emaciated" 
Africans with bodies straight out of Gold's Gym.
"Amistad's" best moments are the quiet ones. A scene where a captive 
African interprets the story of Jesus based on illustrations from a Bible 
is gently moving. A dinner conversation where President Martin Van Buren 
(Nigel Hawthorne) receives thinly-veiled threats about a brewing civil 
war sends chills up the spine. Scenes like those hint at what a great 
film "Amistad" could have been.
If only Spielberg had realized that bombast is no substitute for good 
storytelling. The historical account of the human beings taken captive on 
La Amistad is important, but we barely get to see it here. Instead, we 
get two and one half hours of Spielberg's bells and whistles, with 
lawyers pontificating while the Africans are left in the sidelines. 
"Amistad" has some great moments, but great moments just aren't enough 
anymore.

About 25 minutes into the sneak preview of "Cruel Intentions," during a 
close-up shot of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair french-kissing, a 
couple sitting next to me scooped up their young children and left the 
theater in a huff, grousing that they didn't want to expose their kids to 
"goings on like these." I wondered, of course, why Ward and June had 
brought their kids to an R-rated film about sexual manipulation in the 
first place. But even more puzzling was why it had taken 25 whole minutes 
for them to get offended enough to leave. 
Lascivious and trashy, "Cruel Intentions" is so eager to shock and 
titillate that it's almost endearing. In its quest to be this year's 
"Wild Things," the potboiler trots out virtually anything that be could 
considered even vaguely forbidden to a young person, from interracial 
romance and gay male sex to pseudo-incestuous grinding between step-
siblings. The dialogue features surprisingly graphic descriptions of all 
things erotic. Even the most common of cinematic teases, a simple glimpse 
of the male lead's butt, is presented in a flashy pull-away shot intended 
to maximize its impact. Amazingly, the visual "tah-dah!" worked and a 
number of audience members actually gasped at the sight of Ryan 
Phillippe's bare bottom. Just imagine what they would have done had he 
flashed his winkie.
The fourth film based on Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel "Les liaisons 
dangereuses," "Cruel Intentions" is a teenage version of "Dangerous 
Liaisons," with Phillippe and Gellar subbing for John Malkovich and Glenn 
Close. While Gellar basically turns her emotion meter to the "bitch" 
setting and leaves it there, Ryan Phillippe gives a much more interesting 
performance. As a young cad trying to fool those around him, he neatly 
slides from effete Malkovich wannabe to faux-sincere weasel to genuinely 
infatuated kid effortlessly. He is a lot of fun to watch.
The story, set in Manhattan's upper-crust society, focuses on the twisted 
antics of two inexplicably jaded brats. While Kathryn (Gellar) schemes to 
turn the naďve Cecile (Selma Blair, whose clumsy, overdone 
characterization resembles some perverse hybrid of Elly Mae Clampett and 
Jethro Bodine) into a tramp, her step-brother Sebastian (Phillippe) sets 
his sights on deflowering the beautiful Annette (Reese Witherspoon), 
daughter of the new school headmaster and author of a "virgin manifesto" 
published in Seventeen magazine. Convinced that the chaste girl is too 
much even for Sebastian, Kathryn makes a bet with her sibling: If he 
succeeds, she'll have sex with him, but if he fails, she gets his 
gorgeous 1956 Jaguar. 
Interestingly, Roger Kumble, author and director of this adaptation, 
proves adept at presenting decadence but stumbles when dealing with 
heartfelt romance. The wicked parts of the film, while undeniably 
ludicrous, are also quite entertaining, but when matters turn sincere and 
moralistic, the production hits the ground with a loud thud. There is 
another problem. Interracial and gay liaisons are depicted in a matter-of-
fact fashion that is refreshing, but the commentary surrounding the 
affairs reinforces racist and homophobic attitudes. Had Kumble exercised 
more care with his writing, he could have made the scenes work without 
fueling bigotry.
Those significant flaws aside, the film was far more engaging than I 
expected it to be. Like "Wild Things," "Cruel Intentions" is forthright 
about its lewd trashiness. This is a calculated guilty pleasure and, on 
those terms, I enjoyed it.

Look at the credits for "Hearts in Atlantis." A nostalgic drama starring
Anthony Hopkins, with a screenplay by William Goldman ("Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid") based on a novel by Stephen King and directed by
Scott Hicks, the man who brought us "Shine." How can you go wrong with a
roster like that?
I should make it clear up front that there are elements of "Hearts in
Atlantis" that work very well. The locations are skillfully chosen 
this is a movie with a wonderfully specific sense of place. The
cinematography by the late Piotr Sobocinski is simply gorgeous. Anthony
Hopkins gives a sad, wistful, understated performance and establishes a
fine rapport with young actor Anton Yelchin. There are several memorable
scenes, particularly a Three-Card Monty segment and a first kiss on a
Ferris Wheel.
But the film doesn't work. After leaving the press screening with only a
vague notion that something about the production was wrong, I made a
point to see the movie again at a sneak preview over the weekend, hoping
to pin down the exact source of my discontent. Basically, it boils down
to this: "Hearts in Atlantis" purports to show the incalculable impact a
mentor can have on a child, but offers a contradictory message through
its depiction of the adult version of that child.
As in the far superior "Stand By Me," the film opens with a man dealing
with the death of a childhood friend. Photographer Bobby Garfield (David
Morse) returns to a small Connecticut town for the funeral of his best
pal, Sully, only to learn that Carol, his first love, has also passed
away.
A side note: In the book on which the film is based, Carol did not die.
Reportedly, director Hicks was jarred by the final scene in "Billy
Elliot," which abruptly switched to an adult version of the young star
of the movie. Rather than risk upsetting viewers by presenting an adult
version of Carol, Hicks opted to kill her instead. Thanks, Scott.
In "Stand By Me," the adult revisits his childhood through his writing,
and in the closing scenes, shows that he grew from the experiences. In
"Hearts in Atlantis," the adult Bobby remembers his childhood while
standing in the ruins of his old home, looking morose (and nobody is
better at looking morose than David Morse). When the flashback ends and
the camera returns to him, Bobby simply continues looking morose. If he
gained anything from his mentor, or Carol, or anybody, there is no
evidence of it onscreen. Where "Stand By Me" overflows with life and
growth, "Hearts in Atlantis" traffics in death and stagnancy.
Back in 1962 (cue the overplayed oldies), 11-year-old Bobby (Yelchin)
lives with his widowed mother Elizabeth (Hope Davis, giving a needlessly
shrill performance). The boy often slips away to play with his closest
friends, Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem), while dodging a
local bully. Almost every day, Bobby gazes through the toy store window
at the bicycle of his dreams. Unfortunately, Mom can't afford to buy him
the bike, although she somehow manages to keep a fresh supply of new
dresses.
Life becomes more interesting when Mom takes in a boarder, an elderly
gent named Ted Brautigan (Hopkins). Elizabeth views Ted with suspicion,
but welcomes his money, while Bobby finds the old man fascinating. It
seems that Ted is possessed of a gift and must hide from the "low men"
that would spirit him away because of his gift. He hires Bobby  for a
dollar a week!  to read to him and keep an eye out for his pursuers.
Ted becomes a mentor to Bobby: a reassuring presence and occasional
protector to the boy and his friends. It is here where "Hearts in
Atlantis" lives up to its promise. Although a few scenes fall flat,
particularly a face-off between Ted and the bully, the film captures the
elusive magic that nostalgic pieces shoot for, with just the right
balance of bitter and sweet. Hopkins interacts warmly with the kids, and
young Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem are delightful together. All too
soon, though, the story gives way to melodrama without resonance,
leading to the return of David Morse for the dour wrap-up.
Because of the acting, cinematography and charming middle section, I'm
glad I saw "Hearts in Atlantis." Still, it is amazing that a group of
talents like this was only able to come up with one third of a great
movie.

When presenting her idea for a 24 hour a day TV show following a real 
person through his unscripted life, a network executive explains that her 
brainchild will be live and unedited, thus separating it from PBS' 
notorious documentary "An American Family" and MTV's "The Real World." 
Had I written the script, she would have added, "And it's not like 'The 
Truman Show' either. Our star will be a volunteer with a lot more 
charisma than Truman Burbank."
"EDtv" blends comedy and drama while exploring the lure of fame and the 
perverse contemporary mystique surrounding celebrities. The story suffers 
from unrealistic plot developments towards the end and fails to carry its 
theme through to its logical conclusion, but entertains nonetheless, 
thanks primarily to a deft performance from Matthew McConaughey. As 31 
year old video clerk Ed Pekurny, McConaughey is just terrific, making Ed 
a thoroughly likable doofus stud.
Ed may be a slacker, but he's a cagey one. Asked by the network about his 
drawl, he explains, "I can get rid of this Texas accent whenever I want, 
or I can slide real deep into it just like this. As a rule, it's helpful 
with the ladies." He is remarkably relaxed around the camera, casually 
studying his fanny in one early scene and, later, addressing friends 
directly by talking into the lens. His self-awareness and lack of self-
consciousness makes for a winning combination. When director Ron Howard 
cuts to shots of representative viewers who are hooked on the program, 
you understand why. In fact, "EDtv" the show is considerably more 
enjoyable than "EDtv" the movie.
"EDtv" the show is packed with colorful characters, family histrionics, 
big laughs, high drama and just the right amount of vulgarity. I'd watch 
it in a heartbeat; to catch up on the love triangle between Ed, Shari 
(Jenna Elfman) and big-brother Ray (Woody Harrelson); to hear the latest 
one-liners from Al (Martin Landau), Ed's lovable scene-stealing step-
father; or to witness mother Jeanette (Sally Kirkland) frantically doing 
spin-control when Ed's long-missing father Hank (Dennis Hopper) reappears 
and drops some bombshells about the circumstances surrounding his 
departure. Hell, Ed's fun even during his down time. When he awakens 
sporting morning wood, will he remember the camera is there, or forget 
and allow his hand to slide down his drawers? Voyeurism may be tacky, but 
the truth is that most of you would watch as well.  
"EDtv" the movie is far less engaging. Ron Howard inserts too many ironic 
winks about the decidedly mixed blessings of celebrity, from soundtrack 
lyric references ("Thank you for letting me be myself," "Be careful what 
you wish for") to visual underlining (Shari tries to escape the cameras 
by ducking into a theater playing the film "Solitude"). Enough, Ron, we 
get it! 
Some of the inside gags succeed. After her well-publicized war with ABC, 
it's a kick seeing Ellen DeGeneres play a network executive. Shots of a 
TV talk show where commentators condemn "EDtv" as "a new low in 
broadcasting" work because the panelists, including "TV Nation" vets 
Michael Moore and Merrill Markoe, are not exactly strangers to video 
vulgarity in real life.
Unfortunately, the story takes some wrong turns. When Ed and Shari have a 
spat, the network inserts a cheesy femme fatale straight out of "Melrose 
Place." Ed would not be stupid enough to hook up with this patent phony, 
even for a night. Later, when Ed gets fed up with celebrity life, network 
officials refuse to release him from his contract, leading to a 
needlessly contrived finale.
In real-life, no network official would willingly appear on-camera as a 
villain. Instead, as soon as the show proved successful, they would 
anticipate the inevitable end of the series and be ready to begin 
"SARAHtv" or "MIKEtv" at a moment's notice. As opposed to the ending of 
the film, which I will not reveal, imagine this. The network releases Ed 
from his contract and continues the concept with a new subject. For a 
while, Ed savors his privacy, not to mention all the money. Then the cash 
runs out, he begins to miss the attention and eventually ends up pleading 
in vain for a sequel series. Such a resolution might be on the dour side, 
but if Howard really wants to explore the arc fame generally follows, it 
would be far more realistic and resonant than the film's tidy ending. 
Perhaps Ron Howard, by all reports a level-headed and decent man despite 
his life-long celebrity status, is just too clean-cut for this subject 
matter. Good for Ron, bad for us. As is, "EDtv" serves as breezy, 
disposable entertainment, but only skims the surface of its own dark 
waters.

"Remember the Titans" is a sports film that shares a number of
similarities with "Hoosiers." Both feature well-respected actors and
talented newcomers in stories based on fact. Both showcase fiery coaches
whose jobs are on the line. Both are loaded with picturesque scenery and
stirring music. And both films succeed despite formulaic plotlines that,
on paper, seem impossibly hokey.
The comparisons end there. While "Remember the Titans" is surprisingly
effective, its cheese factor is too high for it to be in the same league
as a gem like "Hoosiers." Still, the production has much to appreciate.
Writer Gregory Allen Howard got the idea for the film after moving from
Los Angeles back to his hometown of Alexandria, Virginia. Living just
outside the Washington D.C. beltway, he noticed something wonderful
about race relations in his city. "It's socially integrated in a way I'd
never seen," he stated. "Movie theaters, restaurants, neighborhoods, I
couldn't understand why. Why here and almost nowhere else? I started
asking around and I kept hearing about this high school football team. I
think it was my barber who first told me about the Titans and these two
coaches. I couldn't imagine that a high school team could so effect an
entire town. Some say they saved the city."
Howard's research brought him to a pair of men who made a difference
(SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals plot points that will surprise no
one). In 1971, the Alexandria school board was forced to integrate an
all-black school with an all-white school. The fireworks begin when Bill
Yoast (Will Patton), head coach of the T.C. Williams High Titans, is
replaced by Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a coach brought in from
South Carolina. The decision infuriates local fans unable to understand
why a man with seniority, a terrific reputation and a pending spot in
the Hall of Fame would be treated so shabbily.
Yoast refuses to accept a position as an assistant until he learns that
his entire team plans to boycott the season. Grudgingly, he signs on,
determined to support his boys while maintaining a healthy distance from
his successor.
Where Yoast is a laid-back sort, Boone turns out to be a ball of fire.
Taking advantage of the summer, he puts the boys through an intense boot
camp, shouting things like "Football is not fun" and "Football is not a
democracy, it's a dictatorship" to his smoldering team of big, surly
black and white athletes. He forces them to get to know one another, a
process designed to teach the folly of prejudice. Gradually, the
majority comes around and, by the end of summer, the young men bond into
a cohesive group.
Then the school year starts and the team realizes that the town does not
share their newfound sense of unity. Protesters line the streets on
opening day, loudly voicing their fury over bussing. Football players
socializing on weekends with their new friends are met with glares and
insults from classmates repulsed by racial intermixing. Coach Boone gets
a brick chucked through his window.
Can the boys' friendships withstand the overt bigotry? Will Boone and
Yoast make nice? Can Boone save his job by leading the team to a winning
season? Is there anyone who doesn't know the answers to these questions?
(END SPOILER ALERT)
As with any film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the man who inflicted
"Armageddon" and "Coyote Ugly" on a world that never did him any harm,
"Remember the Titans" suffers from an overly processed feel. In fact,
there are numerous moments coated with cinematic Velvetta, all melted
and gooey. How do the racially diverse teammates bond? By singing a
golden oldie together, of course. The "let's affirm our relationship by
belting out a Motown tune" syndrome, previously confined to chick
flicks, is now infecting action movies as well. The football team does
three, count 'em, three musical numbers  in a movie about racism! When
the boys aren't singing, an overbearing score oozes over scenes,
determined to make sure we understand exactly how to emotionally
respond.
Nearly as annoying is Hayden Panettiere in the role of Yoast's
precocious 9-year-old kid, Sheryl. One of the reasons the real-life
Yoast participated in this project was to see his daughter, who died of
a heart attack at 34, portrayed on-screen. His sentiment is
understandable, but I wonder if he found Panettiere's stilted
performance a fitting tribute.
Thankfully, the rest of the cast delivers. Denzel Washington is solid,
giving just the right amount of shading to his drill instructor persona.
Will Patton contributes a nicely detailed turn as well, but the real
stars of the film are the boys, particularly Wood Harris as quarterback
Julius "Big Ju" Campbell and Ryan Hurst, who is terrific as team captain
Gerry Bertier.
"Remember the Titans" shines despite its problem areas, thanks to strong
casting and the sincerity of Gregory Allen Howard's screenplay. While
the story ends exactly the way you expect it to end, Howard makes sure
you see that, even at the height of celebration, bigots still stand on
the sidelines. Even Jerry Bruckheimer's melted Velveeta can't cover them
up.

Title
Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
BATMAN AND ROBIN
George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman
Rating: 1 and 1/2  out of five stars. 
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www,nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
The ads for "Batman And Robin" scream "the event of the summer is here" 
and that's the problem. The producers were apparently so intent on 
creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it.
 "Batman And Robin" is 126 minutes of lavish sets, flashy costumes and 
big, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance. It's like 
one of those cheesy Kings Island stage shows; bright, busy and visually 
diverting, but not very much fun.
It wasn't always this way. Tim Burton's "Batman" was an epic story of 
obsession and duality, of darkness and revenge. The film, while far from 
perfect, was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel. Batman was 
a creepy, brooding  creature of the night. The Joker, brilliantly 
overplayed by Jack Nicholson, was at once charismatic and repellent. 
Batman and the Joker were opposite sides of the same coin, battling inner 
demons and one another over Gotham City's breathtaking gothic skyline.
Those days of the Dark Knight are gone, replaced by a psychedelic Ice 
Capades run amuck. "Batman And Robin" has far more in common with the 
campy 60's Batman TV show than with Tim Burton's tale of darkness. 
The blame lies with director Joel Schumacher. A former window-dresser, 
Schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic 
costumes. Unfortunately, when it comes time to have those people walk and 
talk, he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do. "Batman And Robin" is 
overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited 
that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who. While the 
characters flail at each other, one-liners and bad puns are tossed about 
like confetti. A few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie 
sailing, but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film. 
"Batman And Robin" doesn't merely lose momentum, it stalls out completely 
on several occasions. It's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as 
this one.
Ironically, the parts of "Batman And Robin" that work are the ones 
showing the characters in street clothing, and most of those succeed 
because of George Clooney as Bruce Wayne. Easily the best Batman yet, 
Clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of 
depth that the script doesn't even hint at. The film's most effective 
scene is a tender, quiet exchange between Clooney and Alfred (Michael 
Gough), Bruce Wayne's butler and surrogate father. 
As for the other heroes, Chris O'Donnell's Robin is enthusiastic, perky 
and horny as hell, while pudgy Alicia Silverstone is hard to accept as an 
athlete in her debut as Batgirl. In a movie filled to the brim with major 
characters, the decision to add the entirely unnecessary Batgirl and Elle 
Macpherson as Bruce Wayne's girlfriend is puzzling. I suspect the 
producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two 
guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples, shapely 
buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight.
Of course, the real stars of a Batman film are the villains and that's 
where "Batman And Robin" really suffers. As Mr. Freeze, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years, spitting out a 
stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion. Laboring under a ton of 
appliances, Schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in 
his suit, let alone trying to act. Uma Thurman fares somewhat better as 
Poison Ivy. She overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her 
character (it's apparently a rule in the Batman series that before a 
person becomes a villain, s/he must be a cartoonish, bumbling nerd). Once 
Thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic Poison Ivy, she does a nice Mae 
West impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath 
and kill them with a kiss. Thurman fails to maintain the character's 
maniacal sense of style though, and ends up merely sputtering her way 
through the latter scenes of the film.
The biggest lesson to be learned from "Batman And Robin" is that more is 
not better. Joel Schumacher fills the screen with eye candy; but the 
Technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is. 
Some critics suggest that the Batman series has run out of steam. I don't 
think so. My prescription? Fire Joel Schumacher (but offer him a ticket 
to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no 
hard feelings). Give Alicia Silverstone her walking papers, while keeping 
Clooney, O'Donnell and Michael Gough. Call Jack Nicholson and Michelle 
Pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the Joker and Catwoman. 
Then, ditch the campiness and, for the love of Pete, lose the "Event" 
mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time.

Here's the set-up. The comfortable suburban life of Ruby Baker (Leelee 
Sobieski) and her kid brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) is destroyed when 
their parents die in a car crash while celebrating their 20th 
anniversary. Soon after, per the terms of a trust, the kids are sent to 
live with their folks' well-to-do friends Erin Glass (Diane Lane) and 
her husband Terry (Stellan Skarsgard) in a striking glass home on the 
Malibu shores. 
At first, everything seems peachy. The Glasses purchase suitably hip 
clothes for Ruby and two, count 'em, two videogame systems for Rhett. Oh 
sure, they make the teens share one bedroom, but they assure them that 
it is a temporary measure. Then the estate lawyer (Bruce Dern) informs 
Ruby and Rhett that they are collectively worth $4 million. 
Soon, Ruby begins to notice things. Terry and Erin fight a lot. 
Overheard conversations indicate that Terry may be in debt to some very 
nasty men. Erin periodically gets a glassy-eyed stare and her medicine 
cabinet looks like the controlled substances shelf at Walgreens. Terry 
drives like a lunatic and has a tendency to lean in close to Ruby, far 
too close. Could it be that the kids' new guardians are not as pure as 
they appeared to be? 
Well, of course. "The Glass House" is a thriller aimed at teens and, for 
a while, it looks like it just might work. Once Ruby realizes that there 
is trouble in Pepperland, a nice cat and mouse game develops between her 
and the Glasses. But the story degenerates steadily and finally becomes 
just another horror show with a psycho chasing adolescents. Such a 
shame. 
Having Leelee Sobieski (I still think of her as Helen Hunt Jr.) face off 
against Stellan Skarsgard is a great idea. She is one of the smartest 
young actors working today and he comes off as both intelligent and 
scary even when cast in a sympathetic part. But what's the point of 
shipping the brother and the wife to separate parts of the house for 
much of the film, with the boy plugged into videogame nirvana and the 
wife in a chemical one? 
Further, why in the world did the Glasses make two teenagers share one 
bedroom in the first place? Con artists with a plan as elaborate as the 
one concocted by this pair would surely know that the importance of 
keeping up appearances. And Terry Glass would certainly make a better 
attempt at suppressing his dirty old man impulses. 
Ah well, another week in 2001, another new release that starts off 
strong, then goes straight down the drain. What a lousy year. 

Title
Review for In & Out (1997)
A review by Ed Johnson-Ott  copyright 1997
For more reviews, visit www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film".
Comedies rarely receive the respect they deserve, which is a shame. 
Critical accolades are generally reserved for verbose, showy dramas about 
"important" subjects, with comedies dismissed as too frivolous to be 
considered as art. Hopefully that will change with the delightful 
screwball film "In And Out". Not only is "In And Out" the funniest film 
of the year, it's also one of the best. Writer Paul Rudnick ("Jeffrey", 
"The Addams Family") has concocted a gay fairy tale that manages to 
deliver admirable messages about community, family values and the 
importance of being yourself, while maintaining a light, giddy tone and 
delivering big laughs.
Three days before his wedding, Indiana teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin 
Kline) gets the shock of his life when a former student (Matt Dillon) 
outs him during an Academy Award acceptance speech. Brackett frantically 
denies being gay as tabloid reporters turn the small town into a media 
circus. There's a lot more to the story, but revealing the surprises 
would spoil some of the fun.
>From its opening moments, Rudnick and director Frank Oz establish "In And 
Out" as a broad farce, and they never let up the pace. Kevin Kline, who 
won an Oscar for "A Fish Called Wanda", leads the exceptional cast with 
another outstanding performance. In one extremely funny scene, Kline's 
Howard Brackett receives a long, unexpected smooch from an unlikely 
source. During the kiss, Kline uses body language brilliantly to convey a 
wide range of emotional reactions without ever saying a word. This guy 
can do more acting with one leg than most performers can do with their 
whole bodies. 
Kline is surrounded by one of the stronger casts in recent memory. Joan 
Cusack is a riot as Brackett's co-dependent fiancée. Virtually swallowed 
by a billowy wedding gown, she takes the ditzy character's insecurities 
and escalating sense of desperation and plays them to great comic effect. 
As a smarmy tabloid reporter, Tom Selleck gives an assured, almost impish 
performance, one of the finest of his career. Debbie Reynolds, fresh from 
"Mother", is focused and funny as Brackett's mom, a determined woman who 
tells her son, in no uncertain terms, "This wedding MUST happen. I need 
beauty, flowers and nice placemats. It's like heroin". Wilford Brimley 
and Bob Newhart give sturdy supporting performances, and Matt Dillon has 
a great time as Cameron Drake, a vacuous pretty boy film star who seems 
like a cross between Brad Pitt and Luke Perry. 
Complaints about "In And Out" are bound to surface. Some fundamentalist 
Christians will condemn the film as an elaborate piece of gay-positive 
propaganda, while certain uptight gays and lesbians will claim the film 
plays off homosexual stereotypes. What's interesting is that both 
statements are essentially true. "In And Out" uses humor, heartland 
imagery, and a musical score straight out of "Hoosiers" to create a 
sympathetic atmosphere for its gay-positive message. The film is an 
extremely effective piece of propaganda and that's a good thing. The 
"subversive" message of "In And Out" is that being gay is no big thing, 
that real communities will accept and embrace their gay brothers and 
sisters and eventually wonder why there was ever a fuss in the first 
place. Rudnick's agenda is to send audiences out of the theater with 
smiles on their faces and minds a little more open. We can certainly use 
more propaganda like that.
As far as playing off gay stereotypes, "In And Out" does it often and 
well. A number of jokes work off the common perception of gay men as 
somewhat prissy neat freaks who dress impeccably and love Streisand, 
musicals and poetry. But the film doesn't stop there. In the world of "In 
And Out", everyone is a stereotype. Reporters are opportunistic jackals, 
small-town folks are sweet, wide-eyed yokels, fashion models are bulimic 
bimbos, and actors are self-absorbed boobs. Characters are painted with 
broad strokes in farces, that's simply the nature of the beast. Hopefully,
 those on the far left and right will settle down and enjoy the film's 
great humor and enormous good will.
Along with its wonderful performances and pacing, "In And Out" boasts an 
razor-sharp script, bursting with as many pop culture references as a 
dozen episodes of "The Simpsons". In fact, "In And Out" plays a bit like 
a big-screen sitcom. That's just another part of Rudnick and company's 
canny approach. Using familiar images and a screwball comedy format, they 
have created the first wholesome, all-American, family values film about 
gays. "In And Out" is one comedy that truly deserves respect.

Both visually and thematically, "Ravenous" is a messy little film. The 
tale of cannibalism in the Old West can't decide whether to be a horror 
movie, a black comedy or a sweeping metaphor about American imperialism, 
and tries in vain to be all three. The result is a grisly curiosity that 
rarely works on any of its levels.
Set in 1847, we follow the morose Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce) to his 
reassignment at a remote fort in the Sierra Nevadas. Shortly after his 
arrival, Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle), a half-frozen Scotsman, staggers to 
the encampment and collapses. Nursed back to health, he recounts the 
nightmarish story of his group of settlers, forced into cannibalism while 
snowbound in the mountains. 
The soldiers immediately launch a search for survivors, only to discover 
that Colqhoun, hungry for fresh meat, has led them into a trap. Boyd 
escapes by leaping from a cliff, then lands on the body of a fallen 
comrade and, incapacitated by injury, is forced into cannibalism himself. 
Strengthened by the food, he goes back to the fort, only to see Colqhoun 
return, this time in the guise of a commanding officer. Shunned by 
disbelieving fellow soldiers, Boyd tries to convince them of the truth, 
even while fighting an ever-increasing hunger for more human flesh.
After a somber opening, "Ravenous" takes a turn towards black comedy, 
with Jeffrey Jones, looking like some grand Dickens' character, drolly 
introducing the odd ducks who staff the fort. Jeremy Davies (Corporal 
Upham from "Saving Private Ryan") is intriguing as the skittering, giddy 
camp chaplain (despite the fact that, for about the fifth film in a row, 
he plays a minor variation of the same character) and Neal McDonough, 
whose wolf-like blue eyes are mesmerizing, is effective as a soldier 
experiencing the 1847 equivalent of 'roid rage. David Arquette, playing a 
zoned-out loco-weed aficionado, is fun during his brief time onscreen.
Instead of focusing on these interesting folks, the plot dispatches them 
far too quickly as it veers towards straightforward horror. We learn of 
Weendigo, a Native American myth which claims that if you eat the flesh 
of another, you gain their strength and spirit. The wild-eyed Colqhoun is 
a walking testimonial to the belief, displaying super-human strength and 
amazing healing powers generated by his taste for humans. As Colqhoun, 
Robert Carlyle gives an enthusiastic performance, but Pearce's morose 
Captain Boyd is an uninspiring foe for the monster. Almost any of the 
other cast members would have been far more entertaining adversaries. 
As if things weren't going bad enough, the script takes a self-important 
turn, making pompous comparisons between cannibalism and the country's 
expansion. In case anyone misses the leaden metaphors, Colqhoun 
editorializes about Manifest Destiny, helpfully stating that America 
"wants to be whole, stretching out its arms and consuming all it can." 
Despite some stunning photography and a powerhouse score, "Ravenous" 
succumbs to its own pretensions and lack of focus. Had the filmmakers 
ditched the political commentary and followed either the black comedy or 
the horror theme, this could have been a nasty treat. Instead, "Ravenous" 
is merely an exercise in bad taste. And yes, the pun is intentional.

A number of critics have decided that it's open season on Freddie Prize
Jr., slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on
career cruise control in sound-alike, disposable teen fluff like "Head
Over Heels," "Boys and Girls," "Down to You" and "She's All That." While
the Prinze oeuvre is hard to defend, his talent is not. I first saw him
in the independent dark comedy "The House of Yes," where he gave a
subtle, impressive performance as the younger brother in one of
America's freakiest families. Prinze has the acting chops; he just needs
to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the
non-believers that he has what it takes.
"Summer Catch" certainly won't help his case. Inoffensive, but utterly
generic, the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill
time. The story deals with the love affair between Tenley (Jessica
Biel), a wealthy Cape Cod girl and Ryan (Prinze), a local boy from a
working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star.
Ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father
(Bruce Davison) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a Cape
Cod Summer League team.
It's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch, as his time is occupied
with making out with Tenley, fighting with her Dad, bonding with his own
Dad (Fred Ward, who deserves better than this), fighting with his
brother (Jason Gedrick) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his
teammates. The filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky,
character-heavy baseball movie like "Bull Durham," but haven't got a
clue how to get there. And so they glide from one cliché to the next for
108 minutes.
The only bit of originality comes from Marc Blucas in a minor role as a
center-fielder from Texas. In an early barroom scene, Blucas, best known
as demon-fighting Riley Finn from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," hears a
young woman compliment a guy on his ass, then turns to teammate Matthew
Lillard and states, "He does have a nice ass. A bubble butt." When
Lillard gives him an "are you insane?" look, Blucas calmly says, "It's
nothing sexual," then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other
players, including Lillard's.
Speaking of asses, Prinze does not bare his in the movie. The actor has
a no nudity clause in his contract, so two stunt-butts were employed for
a couple of semi-nude shots.
Blucas, whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the
story, gets another unique moment late in the film. Sick of hearing
teammates make "fat chick" jokes, he climbs on top of a table and loudly
declares his love of amply-sized ladies. While his speech still ends up
objectifying women, it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly
ordinary movie.
Trivial tidbit: "Summer Catch" marks a Scooby Doo summit. Marc Blucas
appears in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" as Fred from the Scooby Doo
gang, while Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the same character in the upcoming
big budget film version of the old cartoon.

I entered the theater to see "The Faculty" with low expectations, but 
came out grinning. The sci-fi horror thriller, directed by Robert 
Rodriguez from "Scream" scribe Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is a brash, 
welcome throw-back to the days of American International drive-in flicks. 
Williamson's script, about teens who discover that aliens have taken over 
the bodies of their high school faculty, cheerfully cribs ideas from a 
load of different sources and jumbles them together quite nicely, 
creating a very entertaining diversion. Think "Dawson's Creek" meets "The 
Breakfast Club" meets "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" meets "Scooby-Doo" 
and you'll have some idea of what to expect. "The Faculty" is funny, 
scary, lurid, gross and cheesy in just the right places. 
The film works because Kevin Williamson understands what a kick 
exploitation movies can be. He's smart enough to play with the genre 
without mocking it and bold enough to write some of the most reckless 
scenes I've witnessed onscreen in years. Like any good exploitation flick,
 "The Faculty" is every parent's worst nightmare. In order to save the 
world, Williamson's teen heroes are required to get high, drive like 
maniacs, run around with guns and kill authority figures. Irresponsible? 
Yes, indeed, and isn't it nice to see a writer with faith in young 
people's ability to vicariously enjoy forbidden acts without emulating 
them. 
Our heroes are six teen archetypes, each with just enough detailing to 
feel genuine. Casey (Elijah Wood) is a sheepish nerd prone to tripping 
over his own feet. He has a major crush on head cheerleader/school paper 
editor Delilah (Jordana Brewster), who is only too happy to remind him 
that she is completely out of his league. The aptly-named Delilah breaks 
up with star quarterback and all-around good guy Stan (Shawn Hatosy) when 
he quits the team to focus on his studies, tersely explaining that she 
dated him solely because of his place in the student hierarchy. But Stan 
has a secret admirer in sullen goth bookworm Stokey (Clea Duvall), a 
withdrawn girl who poses as a lesbian, hoping the pretense will cause 
typically homophobic classmates to steer clear of her. 
On the fringes of this urban "Dawson's Creek" quartet is wholesome new 
girl in school, Marybeth (Laura Harris) and Zeke (Josh Hartnett), a 
dealer in fake I.D.'s, bogus videotapes and homemade designer drugs. With 
his ambling gait and chronic bed-head hair, Zeke reminded me of the 
beatnik kid from the "Scooby-Doo" cartoons. In fact, the story's teen 
sleuths were so reminiscent of the "Scooby-Doo" gang that I half-expected 
the film to end with an alien leader exclaiming "My plan would have 
worked if it wasn't for those meddling kids!"    
Drugs, dangerous driving, and guns aside, "The Faculty" does carry a 
tacit positive message, showing that for our world to survive, people 
must set aside their differences and work together. And these kids need 
the power of unity, because in addition to the alien menace, they're 
facing a formidable adult cast.
As the school principal, Bebe Neuwirth is sexy and lethal; a murderous 
variant of her Lilith character from "Cheers" and "Frasier." Robert 
Patrick is terrific as the brutal football coach, his juiciest part since 
"Terminator 2." Patrick's perverse alien smile is even scarier than his 
pre-invasion drill sergeant rants. Both actors make the proceedings all 
the more creepy because their characters actually seem to enjoy being 
possessed. Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, and Daniel von Bargen 
also turn in spirited performances, and Famke Janssen steams up the 
screen as a drab, repressed English teacher transformed into a beautiful 
seductress; a twisted spin on "My Fair Lady," with an alien slug serving 
as her Henry Higgins. Janssen is also the central figure in the film's 
most enjoyably over-the-top special effects scene, a great cornball 
homage to John Carpenter's "The Thing."
As usual, Williamson liberally peppers his script with pop culture 
references, but they seem less self-conscious here than in some of his 
other works. When the teens begin to explore the whole alien parasite 
theory, it's only natural that they look to science fiction for insight, 
speculating that the old axiom "write what you know" might even apply to 
the authors of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "The Puppet Masters." 
Director Robert Rodriguez keeps the film moving at a nice clip, neatly 
balancing laughs, gross-out scenes and "Night of the Living Dead" style 
claustrophobic dread as he builds to a climax that is at once campy and 
intense. Then, to cap things off, Kevin Williamson tweaks contemporary 
horror clichés with a nifty closing scene most notable for what it 
doesn't do. Lurid, high-spirited and unapologetic, "The Faculty" is great 
trashy fun. I only wish I could have watched it at a drive-in.

During a Los Angeles press junket last May, a group of reporters, in town 
to cover another movie, were invited to a late evening screening of "The 
Iron Giant." By the time we were herded into the theater, most of us were 
tired and less than enthusiastic at the prospect of sitting through a 
feature-length cartoon. But 87 minutes later, as the end credits began 
scrolling up the screen, we broke into a warm round of applause and spent 
the ride back to the hotel happily jabbering like little kids. Since 
returning home, I've seen the movie two more times.
Films of this caliber don't come along very often. With a smart script, 
expressive characters and a skillful mix of humor and sentiment, "The 
Iron Giant" offers as many pleasures for adults as it does for children. 
Here's another treat: unlike traditional Disney-style cartoons, the 
feature has no wacky sidekicks or musical numbers. Hallelujah!
Inspired by British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' book, "The Iron Giant" is 
set in 1957 America, during the height of Cold War paranoia. When a local 
fisherman enters a diner in picturesque Rockwell, Maine, blathering about 
a giant metal creature that came crashing out of the sky, no one believes 
him. No one except feisty 9-year old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), the 
only child of single mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston), who works in the 
eatery.
That night, Hogarth goes exploring in the deep woods and encounters a 50-
foot tall robot (Vin Diesel) attempting to eat the town's power plant. 
When the massive creature bites into a transformer and gets zapped, 
Hogarth comes to the rescue and a friendship is forged. Following the 
crash and the near-fatal electric sandwich, the giant has lost his memory,
 so Hogarth begins to teach the powerful behemoth the ways of his new 
world. 
Fearful of how others would react to the robot, Hogarth seeks the 
assistance of beatnik sculptor/junkyard owner Dean McCoppin (Harry 
Connick Jr.) in hiding the mechanical being. Matters grow more 
complicated with the arrival of Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald), a 
smarmy, suspicious and very determined government agent investigating the 
situation. Then, during a play session with a toy ray gun, Hogarth learns 
that the giant might not be as gentle as he thought. 
Writer and director Brad Bird ("The Simpsons," "King of the Hill") says 
he changed the time period of the story to the '50s because "America was 
at a crossroads. We were learning to live with the atom bomb; the space 
race was just beginning; paranoia was at a high; and all of this got into 
the movies of the time... giant ants and mutated Martian men. That's a 
pretty funny response to all of those influences. So if you're going to 
have a story about a human boy who befriends a metal man, it's fitting to 
put it into the context of the fear that existed at the time."
Good thinking. A great part of "The Iron Giant's" charm comes from the 
retro drawing style and well-placed period details. Hogarth watches 
cheesy monster movies on his black and white TV, schoolchildren are 
subjected to ludicrously cheerful "duck and cover" films in the classroom 
and newspapers echo the sentiments of the era with headlines that scream 
"DISASTER SEEN AS CATASTROPHE LOOMS." Worries about the ever-present "Red 
Menace" are echoed in everything from comic books to the film's palette - 
- note the color change when a key object shifts to weapons-mode.
Michael Kamen deserves praise for his witty and stirring score, and for 
selecting evocative music without resorting to the same tired golden-
oldies employed in so many other period films.  
The look of the robot also fits the '50s setting. With a dome-shaped head,
 eyes that resemble searchlights, an angular jaw and massive body plates 
held together by an elaborate array of nuts, bolts and gears, he is 
simply the coolest robot ever. The filmmakers do a fine job making the 
giant seem simultaneously childlike and awe-inspiring. They also adroitly 
mix sound effects and visuals to give us a palpable sense of the 
incredible weight and bulk of the creature. 
For a film as simply drawn as "The Iron Giant," the key characters' faces 
are remarkably expressive, particularly those of Hogarth and his beatnik 
buddy Dean. Between Hogarth's chipped front tooth and exasperated eye 
rolling and Dean's wry glances from his lowered sunglasses, the two are 
more believable than most flesh and blood performers. Voicing the pair, 
Eli Marienthal and Harry Connick Jr. hit all the right notes to complete 
the illusion.
Due to the story structure, Annie is relegated to the background, which 
is a shame because Jennifer Aniston gives the character real vitality. I 
also regretted seeing only lily white faces in Rockwell. For a movie as 
thoughtful and humane as this, the lack of ethnic diversity was 
disappointing.
Thankfully, those were about the only disappointing aspects of the film. 
The production shines because the creative team made sure they had a rich,
 emotionally satisfying story to match their drawings. With lots of 
laughs, a dandy message, a strong sense of wonder and sentimentality that 
never becomes cloying, "The Iron Giant" is a classic. Get ready to feel 
like a kid again.

I don't want to be a writer anymore. I want to be an outlaw in a
contemporary western. How grand life would be. Why, I can see myself
there now...
Like Colin Farrell, the star of "American Outlaws," I am the dreamiest
Jesse James ever, looking less like a bandit and more like the grand
prize in my sister's old "Mystery Date" board game. No matter how rough
the fighting gets, my hair always stays perfectly in place, arcing out
over my thick manly eyebrows which are offset by my button nose and
boyish smile.
When battling evil railroad barons, I surround myself with relatives and
friends, such as my brother Frank (Gabriel Macht), a handsome, bearded
man who, like most men in the 1800s, is prone to quoting Shakespeare.
And my cousin, Cole Younger (Scott Caan), a hot tempered but lovable lad
with a body straight out of the "fanatics only" section of Gold's Gym.
Man, do we look great with our shirts off.
The boys and I leap on our horses and gallop across the land, robbing
banks and trading quips while the bullets fly. Me and Frank and Cole
don't really have to worry about bullets, though. Oh sure, one of us may
get the occasional flesh wound, so we can grimace while everyone fusses
over us in a vaguely erotic fashion, but we won't die, because the
bullets of our opponents can only kill ugly men and extras.
Once in a while we rob trains and, boy, do we ever get clever then! You
see, instead of just stopping a train, we do a homage to those vintage
Burma Shave roadside markers, with gang members holding up a series of
funny signs. You know, just like they did in the real Old West.
And our thrilling exploits are accompanied by authentic Wild West music
by Moby.
In case you were wondering, we didn't start off as sexy outlaws. At
first we were sexy Rebel soldiers in the War Between the States,
protecting ourselves from waves of enemy fire by crouching behind thin
pieces of wood. After the war ended, we came home, only to learn that
the railroad was taking our farms, with security expert Allan Pinkerton
(Timothy Dalton) backing them up.
Those monsters blew up our houses and killed my ma (Kathy Bates), so we
get our revenge by robbing banks and trains. Our neighbors love us,
because we throw some money their way and we become folk heroes, with
trashy newspapers chronicling our adventures. Oh, how we laugh at the
foolishness of the unrealistic stories. I mean, what's the point in
taking the lives of genuine historic figures and turning them into glib,
glossy fairy tales about guys more suited to the Abercrombie & Fitch
catalog than the frontier?
What, indeed. See you at Westworld, folks.

"Varsity Blues" is an utterly formulaic teen sports, sex and suds 
potboiler that flirts with serious issues, only to dive back to the 
comforting safety of clichés. Aimed at young, uncritical audiences, the 
film dutifully trots out everything you'd expect from a hack exploitation 
movie. There's the idealistic hero, complete with a devoted girlfriend, a 
gorgeous temptress, and parents who just don't understand. There's the 
standard-issue football team, comprised of one all-American quarterback 
to be worshipped by all, one muscular party monster to whoop it up and 
bare his ass, one fat guy to be comical and sad, one black guy to suffer 
nobly, and, of course, the big, bad coach, a thundering racist bully who 
badgers injured players into taking steroid injections. Finally, there's 
the plot, which... well, suffice to say it all builds up to THE BIG GAME. 
Ain't Hollywood grand?
Rather than trudging through the usual review formalities, I'll just 
share a few minor observations about "Varsity Blues." SPOILER ALERT: The 
following contains references to key plot points. 
1.  I understand the Hollywood convention of having actors play 
characters considerably younger than their actual age, but there is no 
way on Earth that any of this film's stars could pass themselves off as 
high school students. In fact, several of them look more like high school 
teachers.
2.  Because "Varsity Blues" is set in a small Texas town, some cast 
members strive for authenticity by adopting Southern accents ranging from 
a fairly credible drawl to twangs straight out of "The Beverly 
Hillbillies." As is the cinematic norm, most of the actors periodically 
forget their accents, only to recall them later. Other performers skip 
the accents entirely, sounding like their characters just moved to West 
Canaan from Santa Monica.
3.  In "Dawson's Creek," James Van Der Beek's head appears far too big 
for his body, but it looks almost normal here. Whatever you're doing, 
James, keep it up!
4.  Who in the world chose Ron Lester to play the team's obligatory fat 
guy? The young actor is so morbidly obese that I doubt if he could carry 
a sack of groceries up a flight of stairs without getting winded, let 
alone play a football game. It was hard to enjoy Lester's scenes because 
I caught myself fearing for his health - - and I am not joking. 
5.  You're a young, strong, intelligent black student being verbally 
abused and physically endangered by an authority figure. What should you 
do? Why, wait passively until a white student comes to the rescue! Oh, 
the wonderful messages Hollywood sends to teenagers.
6.  One of the film's subplots involves several team players visiting a 
strip bar, where they discover their sex-ed teacher moonlighting as a 
dancer. When she leaves the stage, she pleads with the boys to "keep her 
secret." Keep her secret?! Unless every other male in a 50 mile radius of 
the bar is gay, I'm betting word of her "secret" just might have already 
leaked out.
7.  Speaking of logic, here's a brief memo to Coach Kilmer: if you're 
going to illegally inject steroids into the leg of a seriously injured 
player... close the damn door.
8.  A bit more about the Coach. Here we have a guy with an unbelievable 
winning streak, a man so beloved that that town has built a statue of him.
 So why is he still coaching in Hooterville?
9.  A note to Jon Voight: For the love of Pete, would you please play a 
good guy for a change? And while you're at it, hold out for a better part 
next time.
10.  Finally, if you are trying to inspire your fellow players that the 
"winning is everything" philosophy is wrong, you'd be well advised to 
avoid urging them to "go out there and play like gods."
The bottom line is this. Formula movies don't have to be bad. "Hoosiers" 
used every genre convention in the book, but the film came splendidly to 
life because the filmmakers created an absolutely authentic feel and 
invested the story with genuine passion. As long as video stores stock 
"Hoosiers," there is no reason to watch pap like "Varsity Blues."

The tagline for "Rushmore" is "Love... Expulsion... Revolution." Without 
giving too much away, I would have also added "Reconciliation." For his 
sophomore film, "Bottle Rocket" director Wes Anderson has crafted a 
comedy virtually bursting at the seams with style and substance. 
"Rushmore" is at once wildly anarchic and deeply humane. I've seen it 
three times and enjoyed it more with each viewing. 
The story details the adventures of Rushmore Academy student Max Fischer 
(Jason Schwartzman), an intense 15-year-old so obsessed with becoming a 
Renaissance Man that he can't be bothered with actual studying. When not 
busy with a mind-boggling number of extracurricular activities, he writes,
 produces and occasionally stars in highly derivative, elaborately staged 
plays, including a surprisingly gritty high school adaptation of "Serpico.
" 
Shortly after we meet Max, two events radically alter his life. He falls 
in love with widowed first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams),
 and becomes friends with industrial tycoon Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a 
deeply depressed middle-aged Rushmore alumnus. Max enlists Blume's help 
with his grandiose plans to win the heart of Miss Cross, undeterred by 
her gentle, but increasingly stern rebuffs. Then the unthinkable happens..
 Blume also becomes enamored with the comely teacher. When Max learns of 
Blume's crush, he turns on the businessman, leading to a state of open 
warfare between the two.
It would be easy to think of "Rushmore" as simply a delightfully off-the-
wall comedy, but there is so much more to savor. Anderson is a whiz with 
a camera, using beautifully composed wide-screen images and gliding slow-
motion shots to visually punctuate the story. The music is just as good, 
blending a number of relatively obscure British Invasion pop gems with 
Mark Mothersbaugh's delicate harpsichord-laced score (the soundtrack 
album is one of the best I have ever heard).
Down to the tiniest supporting role, the casting is perfect. Jason 
Schwartzman, in his debut as an actor, gives a virtuoso performance. 
Employing a droll, deadpan delivery spiced with periodic bursts of pure 
adolescent angst, Schwartzman expertly creates a credible portrait of an 
over-reaching under-achiever. Max is absolutely determined to take on the 
world, despite the fact that he knows very little about it. Wearing the 
latest in geek chic, Max looks foolish, behaves horribly and takes 
himself very, very seriously. Anyone who remembers navigating the choppy 
waters of puberty will recognize bits of themselves in this totally 
focused and terribly lost young man.  
Bill Murray does the finest work of his career as passive-aggressive 
Herman Blume, an angry boy stuck in a respectable businessman's body. In 
an address to the Rushmore students, Blume speaks of the rich, urging the 
kids to "Get 'em in the crosshairs and take them down." He's not kidding. 
Blume hates what he has become and admires Max for possessing the 
vitality that he so desperately lacks. Even while being assaulted by bees,
 Blume can't resist smiling when he realizes that Max orchestrated the 
attack. Study Murray's eyes and subtle changes of expression and you'll 
understand just how good a dramatic actor he really is.
There is a lot of drama within the bittersweet comedy of "Rushmore." Miss 
Cross, in a nicely-tempered turn by Olivia Williams, mourns the loss of 
her husband, while Max mourns the loss of his mother and Blume mourns the 
loss of his spirit. Wes Anderson has nothing but affection for his 
damaged characters, and he treats them with the dignity they deserve. 
>From Bert (Seymour Cassel), Max's unconditionally loving father, to 
Magnus (Stephen McCole) a gregarious Scottish thug, it's a genuine 
pleasure to spend time with these people.
Anderson also creates an almost otherworldly feel by providing the 
characters with a level playing field. Young or old, tall or short, 
friend or enemy, each person carries equal authority depending on the 
circumstance. The towering Blume reacts like a whipped pup when little 
Dirk, Max's choir partner and sidekick (Mason Gamble, in a wonderfully 
solemn performance), indignantly berates him for betraying Max. Magnus 
abruptly shifts from wrathful foe to willing compatriot when presented 
with a benign offer from Max. In this weathered utopia, character 
actually matters more than size or social status.
And in the end, reconciliation is offered to one and all. As the tale 
reaches its hilarious climax, Max executes a grand gesture that pulls 
everyone to the same place at the same time, giving each character a 
chance to make peace with those around them. What a fine way to wrap up 
an ingenious, inventive gem of a movie. If you're like me, you'll enjoy 
"Rushmore" on first viewing and come to treasure it the second or third 
time around.

If you loved "Patch Adams" and "Stepmom," ignore this review and run, do 
not walk, to see "The Other Sister." If, however, you detest cheesy, 
emotionally manipulative, contrived pabulum, avoid this sap-fest like the 
plague. As the proud father of a retarded son, I generally applaud any 
film championing acceptance and independence for mentally-challenged 
individuals, but this movie is insufferable and, at 128 minutes, a 
torturous endurance test. 
Like most contemporary melodramas, "The Other Sister" features uptight 
white people fussing with their kids in affluent settings (apparently the 
filmmakers believe that those unable to stomach the story can at least 
while away the time admiring the plush houses). In this case, the rich, 
white pain-in-the-ass is Diane Keaton, playing a priggish woman standing 
in the way of her mildly-retarded daughter's romance. 
The mother of three, she beams with pride at her one "normal" daughter, a 
radiant girl about to marry an all-American guy. Meanwhile, she refuses 
to acknowledge another daughter's female lover, explaining to her 
exasperated offspring that she isn't a bigot because she donates money to 
gay causes. As for her retarded child, Mom adopts a strained martyr's 
smile anytime the girl commits a social faux-pas and throws a fit 
whenever the young woman tries to assert her independence. Tom Skerritt 
suffers nobly as the crinkle-faced ex-drunk husband, a kindly soul who 
serves as the voice of reason and acts as arbitrator between mother and 
daughter. The only intriguing question raised by the film is why a man 
like this remains married to such an unrelenting harridan. 
Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi play the mentally-challenged love 
birds, affecting "retarded" voices, but otherwise using perfect syntax 
and eloquent phrasing. Right. Never for a moment do they seem like 
anything other than two actors doing handicapped shtick. Playing a 
retarded person is difficult. Tom Hulce pulled it off in "Dominick and 
Eugene" and Leonardo DiCaprio was convincing in "What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape," but more often than not, even the most talented performers come 
across as mannered and unconvincing. Lewis and Ribisi, two generally 
impressive actors, are patently phony here (when Lewis asks Ribisi who 
invented sex, watch him recite his punchline while shamelessly aping 
Dustin Hoffman's "Rainman" delivery).
Their characters are painfully unrealistic Hollywood clichés, mentally-
challenged individuals presented as eternal children in adult bodies, who 
possess a naive wisdom and innate decency that makes them so very, very 
"special." One of the film's most irritating scenes shows the pair 
dressed up for a Halloween party in an absurd swan outfit and a ragged 
puppy suit. Virtually every mildly-retarded person I know wants to be 
viewed as an adult and not "special" or childlike. They have to work 
extremely hard to receive the same treatment the rest of us take as a 
given. Ask my son to put on a puppy suit and he'll tear your head off, 
chastising you for even suggesting he do something so babyish and 
undignified.
Had the folks behind "The Other Sister" done a little research, they 
might have noticed things like that. But, of course, that's a lot to 
expect from director and co-writer Garry Marshall, the amiable boob 
responsible for such TV perennials as "Happy Days," and cinematic gems 
like "Pretty Woman," "Dear God" and "Exit To Eden." Marshall is the king 
of glossy schlock and "The Other Sister" fits neatly into his sit-com 
oeuvre. Adept at grinding out handsomely photographed trifles filled with 
contrived moments calculated to get the crowd cheering, Marshall wouldn't 
know a genuine emotion if it came up and bit him. Actually, it's 
surprising that he wasted valuable time on a film like this when he could 
have been developing money-making projects more attuned to his skills, 
you know, something along the lines of "Laverne and Shirley: The Movie."

In its time, "The Twilight Zone" was groundbreaking television, but 
watching it today often proves to be a taxing experience. Many episodes, 
built around ideas that felt startlingly original then, seem trite now. 
Too many were terribly padded, with sketchy characters chattering 
incessantly to kill time until the big surprise payoff at the end. And as 
for those surprise payoffs, some still hold up beautifully ("Don't get on 
that ship! That book, 'To Serve Man,' it... it's a cookbook"), but many 
others ("It's a planet called... Earth," "Pleased to meet you, Eve, my 
name is... Adam") feel so painfully obvious that it's embarrassing. 
Which brings me to "The Thirteenth Floor," the latest entry in the "what 
is reality?" genre. Loosely based on Daniel Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3,
" the idea for this story was probably hot stuff when released in the 
'60s, but in the post "Dark City," "Matrix," "eXistenZ" cinematic world, 
it has a decided "been there, done that" sensibility. While the 
production boasts some jazzy visuals, the characters are so generic and 
undeveloped that it's impossible to care what happens to them. The film 
is boring and, if you haven't figured out the lame "surprise payoff" by 
the time our hero takes his first drive into the country, then you simply 
weren't trying.
The set-up (don't worry, I'll keep this short) goes like this: Some 
computer whiz kids have cooked up a virtual reality device that allows 
the user to "jack-in" and play out various experiences in a sepia-toned 
(they're still having troubles getting the color right) 1937 Los Angeles. 
When one of the creators gets murdered in our world, his colleague takes 
a dangerous trip into the simulated past to search for clues. 
If you just found yourself thinking "Wow, that reminds me of Jean-Luc 
Picard having a Dixon Hill adventure on the holodeck," then 
congratulations, you're as big a geek as I am.
Even though the whole "what is reality?" thing has been done to death 
lately, the film still could have worked had the screenplay been better, 
but the characterizations here are utterly flat. Armin Mueller-Stahl 
injects what life he can into his role, but has relatively little screen 
time to work with. The rest of the cast, particularly leads Craig Bierko 
and Gretchen Mol, are just plain bad. 
What the film does get right are some of the visuals. 1937 Los Angeles is 
beautifully detailed and looks great, and a shot of one character 
reaching the edge of the simulation, while overly reminiscent of the 
aforementioned holodeck, is striking nonetheless. Other effects are less 
successful. Wormhole style images of characters entering the virtual 
world have been better realized in everything from "Contact" to "Sliders" 
and the buildings in the closing shot are both cheesy and illogical (I 
don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that the date and the 
architecture don't exactly gibe).
Had "The Thirteenth Floor" been cut to 22 minutes, it might have made a 
superior episode of "The Twilight Zone." As a feature film, though, this 
is a bloated trifle, with pleasures too minor to warrant the expenditure 
of your time and money. If you're in the mood to question reality, do it 
with "The Matrix" or "Dark City."

In one of the many awe-inspiring scenes in "What Dreams May Come," Chris 
Nielsen awakens inside of a beautiful painting. Tentatively, he begins to 
explore his incredible new surroundings and discovers that the paint in 
the gorgeous landscape he now occupies is not completely dry. He plucks a 
lovely blue flower and holds the blossom in his hand, admiring its hyper-
rich coloring. Then he squeezes it too hard and the flower loses its 
integrity, leaving his fingers covered with bright blue paint. Moments 
later, after surveying the glorious vista in front of him, a giddy 
Nielsen races down a lush green hill towards the lake at its base, again 
forgetting the fragility of his environment. Once more, reality begins to 
unravel and the frantic man finds himself sinking into brightly colored 
paint, his legs trapped by radiant color turned into an oozing mess. 
Much like that scene, "What Dreams May Come" is a visually breathtaking 
work that is grand to behold, but eventually loses its integrity and 
becomes an oozing mess. After promising to lead us through a bold 
adventure in the afterlife, the screenplay takes a tragic wrong turn and 
lands in a murky swamp of confusion and psychobabble.
It's a real shame, because the filmmakers' intentions are as ambitious as 
their subject is fascinating. Every man, woman and child ever born has 
speculated on the mechanics of the afterlife. The possibilities are 
limitless, but our visions are generally vague at best. Most often, we 
either imagine people in robes lounging on clouds, whiling away eternity 
playing the harp, or picture some nebulous Oz-like city with gold-paved 
streets. Movies have reflected our pedestrian notions, lazily depicting a 
bland afterlife with fog machines blowing smoke across a blue backdrop. 
Until now, only "The Green Pastures," a charming 1936 movie set in an 
idyllic, countrified Heaven, tried to show an afterlife that actually had 
a sense of place.
After studying great artists' renderings of paradise and hell, "What 
Dreams May Come" presents an afterlife comprised of many wonderfully 
imaginative and strikingly tangible worlds. The film is a banquet for the 
eyes, presenting images that range from enchanting baroque picture books 
made real to Germanic impressionist nightmares turned horribly vivid. How 
sad to see so much creativity serving such an undeserving script.
I haven't read the Richard Matheson novel on which the film is based, but 
it has to be better than Ron Bass' inadequate screenplay. The story 
introduces star-crossed lovers Chris and Annie Nielsen (Robin Williams 
and Annabella Sciorra), then quickly rips their world apart. Four years 
after the devastating loss of their two children, Chris is killed while 
trying to help victims of an automobile accident. He views the aftermath 
of his death in a ghost state, accompanied by a colorful blurred figure. 
In time, the corporeal world fades and Chris moves to a ravishing 
surrealistic realm, where the now-clear figure identifies himself as 
Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Chris' guide to the afterlife. Albert explains 
the mechanics of the domain. Thought is reality and each person creates 
their own eternity, generally starting by reconstituting their body and 
surrounding themselves with a comforting landscape. You can change forms 
and worlds at will, reunite with loved ones when you're ready, or choose 
to be reborn for another run at life on planet Earth. 
Just as Chris is beginning to adjust, enjoying a blissful reunion with 
one of his children and exploring the wonders around him, he learns that 
Annie has committed suicide, dooming herself to infinity in a hell of her 
own creation. Told that there is nothing he can do and that his feelings 
for Annie will fade in time, Chris spits out "No! We're soulmates!" and 
dives into Hades to save his beloved, joined by a mysterious figure known 
as the Tracker (Max Von Sydow).  
Handled properly, this story could have shined, but Bass turns a lyrical 
premise into a dismal bog of grandiose posturing, condescending homilies 
and convoluted dialogue, all dressed up with loads of irritatingly coy 
pop psychology. "What Dreams May Come" pretends to offer the secrets of 
the universe, but beneath all the pretentious wailing and gnashing of 
teeth, its message is trite and obvious. After being subjected to such a 
cavalcade of histrionics, we deserve revelations, damn it!
The best performances in the film come from the supporting players. 
Rosalind Chao (Keiko from a couple of "Star Trek" series) is quietly 
effective as a spirit guide and, playing the Nielsen kids, Jessica Brooks 
and Josh Paddock are direct, focused and touching. Max Von Sydow, on the 
other hand, sleepwalks through his trite role. As for Williams, Sciorra, 
and Gooding; well, they do what they usually do. 
"What Dreams May Come" warrants a visit despite its dreadful script, 
thanks to the aforementioned supporting actors and the film's incredible 
visuals. To best enjoy the experience, though, I suggest you follow this 
suggestion: ignore the words and just look at all the pretty pictures.

Title
Review for Anaconda (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Midway through "Anaconda", documentary filmmaker Terri Flores (Jennifer 
Lopez) turns to a co-worker and says "I thought this movie would be my 
first big break. Instead, it's turned into a disaster." Truer words have 
never been spoken.
"Anaconda" is a monster movie with a lousy monster. It's a suspense film 
that is utterly predictable. It's a mess The film does manage to drum up 
some scares, but only in the most elementary way, like a jack-in-the-box. 
As you turn the crank, you're totally aware that the damn clown is going 
to pop up, but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens. The 
main difference between the giant snake in "Anaconda" and the clown in a 
jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic. "Anaconda" boasts 
some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years. 
Animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe-
inducing robots you've endured at Disney World. But it's the computer 
animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame. In one 
shot, a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree 
near a waterfall, but the giant snake springs out and loops around its 
hapless victim in mid air. The scene, if done well, would have been a jaw-
dropper. Here, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than 
a Saturday morning cartoon. What's really amazing is that the filmmaker's 
were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the 
promotional trailers for the movie. 
But enough about the phony snakes. Now it's time to talk about the lousy 
story. Heroic and very pale anthropologist Eric Stoltz leads a 
documentary film crew down a Brazilian river in search of the Shirishama 
Indians, a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the 
rain forest. Stoltz tells his crew "Pray that you didn't forget your bug 
spray." Apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff, because 
they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no 
ill effect.  Along the way, the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest 
(Jon Voight) who claims to know how to find the Shirishama. Within 
minutes, they throw away all their plans and follow Voight down a 
tributary into the land of creepiness. From that point on, the film is a 
hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from "Jaws" and "Dead Calm."
One of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of Eric 
Stoltz. Early in the story, his character gets knocked into a coma by a 
river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious. So 
why did they hire an actor of the caliber of Stoltz for what amounts to a 
cameo appearance? Also, why did Stoltz, who generally selects his roles 
with great care, agree to appear in this crap? Ah, the mysteries of 
Hollywood.
The remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to 
happen. Jonathan Hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous Englishman hired 
to narrate the documentary, but Lopez and Ice Cube manage to rise above 
their cardboard characters. Lopez, who starred in "Selena," is an 
enormously appealing performer, possessing a vibrancy that makes even the 
most trite lines seem credible. Ice Cube has a special charisma; an 
ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously. 
There's also a special twinkle in his eyes, as if he's gently mocking his 
own tough-guy posturing. 
But the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of 
Jon Voight. Obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas, Voight 
plays the villain in thick accent, with a series of leers and hisses, 
spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of "Jonny 
Quest." At one point, he looms over the crew and says "The anaconda is 
the perfect killing machine. It strikes, wraps around you, holds you 
tighter than your true love. And you get the privilege of hearing your 
bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode.
" That moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable. 
Almost.
Fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out "Anaconda." Don't. 
There are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer, 
including another "Alien" sequel. Wait for them, rent "Jaws" in the 
meantime, and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this.

1999 has been a stellar year for animation, bringing viewers the
exhilarating and heart warming adventure, "The Iron Giant," Disney's
kinetic version of "Tarzan," the outrageous "South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut" and the American release of the Japanese epic,
"Princess Mononoke." To cap off this surfeit of riches, we now have
"Toy Story 2," a terrific sequel to the smash 1995 story about the
private lives of toys.
The original "Toy Story" initially drew a great deal of attention for
being the first totally computer animated film, then became an instant
classic because it was a marvel of warm, clever storytelling. "Toy
Story 2" does its parent proud, delivering 92 minutes of smart, zippy
entertainment. The characters are even better defined than in the
original, the action is fast and furious and there are loads of laughs
in this remarkably inventive movie.
Director John Lasseter and his associates at Pixar clearly understand
what makes for a winning sequel. They touch on treasured moments from
the original without repeating them, and allow the characters to grow,
while retaining the qualities that made us love them in the first
place. "Toy Story 2" is that rarest of birds; a sequel as good as (and
some will argue, better than) the original.
As with the first film, the story is deceptively simple. While young
Andy is away at camp, his cherished cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks) gets
stolen by a toy collector (Wayne Knight, nicely portraying the greedy
mindset of those who hoard toys for their investment potential). A
rescue team is quickly organized and action figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (John
Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Slinky Dog (Jim
Varney) hit the city streets to save their friend.
While stashed away, Woody learns of his illustrious history and has a
crisis of conscience. Seems he was a TV celebrity in the '50s,
starring in a "Howdy Doody" style puppet show, and has an extended
family from the glory days: spunky cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack),
Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey
Grammar). Jesse pleads with Woody to stay; explaining that if he
escapes, she will be put back into storage, the purgatory for
neglected toys.
The story contains an amazing number of riotous set pieces, none of
which I will reveal here. Suffice to say that everything satisfying
from the original returns with clever twists, and the new additions to
the family of toys are most welcome.
In this cavalcade of delights, I have only two minor
criticisms. First, both films would have been better served by keeping
the human characters offscreen (as the adults were handled in the
various "Peanuts" TV shows). While great strides have been made in
computer animation, they still can't create convincing humans and the
presence of partially realized people is distracting. Second, as with
Pixar's "A Bug's Life," the latter portion of "Toy Story 2" gets a
little busy. In their quest to satisfy the audience, the filmmakers
try a bit too hard and the pace becomes needlessly frenetic. The folks
at Pixar need to realize that they are working with magic here and
with magic, simplicity is the key.
I want to stress that these are minor quibbles. "Toy Story 2" is a
triumph, blending bright, eye-popping animation, exceptional work from
its voice talent and wildly imaginative writing (peppered with
hilarious pop culture references) to create one of the best films of
the year. Those who dismiss the movie as "kid's stuff" are doing
themselves a disservice. Like the original, "Toy Story 2" is a
treasure for everyone.

On paper, "Mystery, Alaska" looks like a winner. The premise - - an
article about a small town hockey team prompts the New York Rangers to
come calling for an exhibition game - - sounds like fun. The cast
contains a slew of top notch actors, including Russell Crowe
("L.A. Confidential") and Ron Eldard ("Men Behaving Badly"), along
with Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich and the always sturdy Burt
Reynolds, supported by reliable character actors Colm Meaney ("Star
Trek: The Next Generation"), Hank Azaria (Apu from "The Simpsons"),
and Maury Chaykin. The film even boasts dandy cameo appearances from
Mike Myers and Little Richard. So why is "Mystery, Alaska" such a
mess?
Kelley, who co-wrote the film with Sean O'Byrne, is also the man
behind the inert "Jaws"-with-an-alligator rip-off "Lake Placid," and
the TV series "Picket Fences," "Chicago Hope," "Snoops," "Ally McBeal"
and "The Practice." He was crowned King of Hollywood last month when
"Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" won Emmys for Best Comedy and Best
Drama.
Angered when "The Practice" beat the infinitely superior series, "The
Sopranos," a number of alternative journalists recently declared war
on Kelley, turning out lengthy attacks on the absurdly prolific
writer. For the record, I want to make one thing clear: I disliked
David E. Kelley long before it became trendy.
While Kelley possesses some undeniable gifts, particularly the ability
to convincingly present both sides of an argument, he is essentially a
stunt writer. He takes characters and situations straight out of "The
Jerry Springer Show," removes the trailer park accents and presents
the resultant bathos as cutting edge television. He clutters his shows
with snarky interpersonal conflicts, and delights in presenting
overblown speeches, preferably in a courtroom setting (during "Lake
Placid," I half-expected to see the alligator hauled in front of a
judge).
Virtually all of Kelley's worst tendencies run unchecked in "Mystery,
Alaska." For most of the film, the hockey story is smothered beneath
relationship blathering and a stream of hammy speeches (and, yes,
there is a courtroom scene). Eventually, the main story kicks in,
building to a finale that tries to be a frost-bitten "Hoosiers."
The production even includes one of the most annoying movie
clichés, the "Rudy" clap. It goes like this. In a dramatic
situation where real humans would immediately break into thunderous
applause, the "Rudy" clap attempts to stir audience emotions by having
one character slowly begin applauding. Gradually, his handclaps grow
faster and faster as others join in and the whole thing builds to a
full-fledged ovation. On my irritation-meter, the "Rudy" clap lands
somewhere between calls from telemarketers and performances by Carrot
Top.
The story starts off well, with the weekly hockey game that has long
been a tradition in the tiny burg of Mystery. The game is entertaining
and the players are an enjoyable lot. But then the avalanche of
subplots begins. An early draft of this review included two paragraphs
packed with subplot descriptions, but I'll spare you the details.
While the 90 minutes that precede the big game are mostly tedious,
there are some nice moments. Ron Eldard is enjoyable as the village
Lothario. A sex scene between two randy teens provides big laughs, as
does the bit where a player is punished by being pushed into a snow
bank while wearing only a jock strap. But most of the fun occurs
during the final half-hour, as little Mystery tries to keep their
dignity in the midst of the media circus surrounding the exhibition
game. Mike Myers draws smiles as a smarmy color commentator and Mayor
Pitcher conspires with Little Richard to turn a rendition of the
National anthem into a tactical advantage for the team.
But oh, do you have to pay for those good parts. I suggest you wait
until "Mystery, Alaska" hits cable. Then you can settle back and enjoy
the minor pleasures of this trifle while reading a good book during
the dull sections. Come to think of it, that's what I do on those rare
occasions when I watch one of David E. Kelley's TV shows.

When trying to determine how best to describe "Clay Pigeons," the image 
of a Dennis Miller performance comes to mind. Generally, Miller makes his 
stage entrance displaying supreme confidence, half ambling and half 
swaggering his way to the microphone. Then he lets rip with a torrent of 
dazzling verbal creativity. Adroitly juggling observations and 
indictments, with accents from his vast personal warehouse of arcane pop 
references, Miller's presentation style announces "I'm smart, hip and 
right, and so are you, if you're able to keep up with me." 
After a few minutes of watching Miller, though, you begin to notice other 
things. He's extremely mannered, without a hint of spontaneity. He's self 
satisfied and arrogant. And, beneath his exalted moral righteousness, 
he's often just as mean as the villains against which he rails so 
mightily. Typically, Miller ends his rants by saying "Or maybe it's just 
me," but he's only being facetious, using the catch-phrase as an easy way 
to wrap up the show. As much as I enjoy Dennis Miller, his performances 
usually leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Which brings us to "Clay Pigeons." This darkly humorous tale about murder 
in a small Montana town starts off with a knockout punch, daring to take 
a classic film noir storyline and place it outdoors in bright sunlight. 
Combining bold camerawork, brazen situations and a terrific soundtrack, 
the film quickly establishes its stance as smart and hip, aiming for that 
post-modern cinematic playground occupied by the likes of the Coen 
brothers.
It all rolls along smoothly for a while, but then you begin to notice 
things. When a woman gets backhanded early in the story, the filmmakers 
make sure we understand that she deserved it. Later, a woman gets stabbed 
to death in a scene filmed so stylishly that the violence seems almost 
pornographic. Like most noir thrillers, our hero is a hapless type whose 
poor judgment lands him in a heap of trouble, but these filmmakers 
clearly have far more affection for the villain than the victims. 
Ultimately, this mannered, disdainful work rewards viewers with an lazy 
ending and a bitter aftertaste.
The story begins when Clay Bidwell (Joaquin Phoenix) goes out shooting 
with his best friend Earl (Gregory Sporleder). In a burst of emotion, 
Earl angrily informs Clay that he's aware of his friend's ongoing affair 
with his wife, Amanda (Georgina Cates). Abruptly, Earl turns the gun on 
himself, intending to exact revenge by framing Clay for his "murder." A 
stunned Clay disposes of Earl's body and tries to break off contact with 
Amanda, but the sultry widow, totally unfazed by her husband's death, is 
determined to continue the affair. When Clay resists her advances and 
takes up with another woman, he soon finds himself with an additional 
corpse to dispose of. 
In-between fatalities, Clay makes friends with the charismatic Lester 
Long (Vince Vaughn), a drifter hanging around the sleepy Montana town. 
They take off for a fishing trip on the lake where Clay dumped corpse 
number two and, to the ominous strains of "Dueling Banjos" from the film 
"Deliverance," a body rises from the murky depths. Enter the FBI, led by 
bright-eyed, sharp-tongued agent Dale Shelby (Janeane Garofalo), on the 
trail of a serial killer who specializes in women. Suddenly, Clay finds 
himself the prime suspect in a string of murders. 
In addition to its clever presentation style, "Clay Pigeons" boasts a 
number of stand-out performances. Vince Vaughn is electric as Lester Long,
 an imposing figure comfortable even when striding in public wearing only 
his briefs. Lester is a man who leans in a little too close while talking 
and relishes being overly familiar with anyone he meets. You'll remember 
him and his nervous giggle long after leaving the theater.
Janeane Garofalo is wonderful as the caustic, but deeply humane Agent 
Shelby, brightening the grim proceedings with her understated wit. Phil 
Morris is effective as her stoic co-worker, a man of few words whose 
facial expressions more than make up for his relative silence, and Scott 
Wilson (one of the killers from "In Cold Blood") scores as the laconic 
Sheriff Mooney. In the lead role, Joaquin Phoenix is adequate, if overly 
flat in his delivery. 
After a great beginning, "Clay Pigeons" grows more forced with each new 
outlandish twist, as the film's carefully crafted tension slowly unravels.
 The story eventually sputters to an unsatisfying end with a denouement 
that feels perfunctory at best.
The bottom line is that sadism and death are punchlines in "Clay Pigeons" 
and we're expected to play along, else we jeopardize our status as smart, 
hip filmgoers. While the production offers sharply drawn characters, a 
powerhouse cast, some great deadpan one-liners, exceptional music and 
robust visuals, there is an underlying nastiness that becomes 
increasingly difficult to tolerate as the film goes on. "Clay Pigeons" is 
hip at the expense of its humanity, and that's more nihilism than I'm 
willing to embrace.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
The first hint of where "Cast Away" is headed comes with its title.
Instead of the one-word "Castaway," which conjures up romanticized fare
like "Swiss Family Robinson" or slapstick comedy like "Gilligan's
Island," the title is split into "Cast Away," as in cast away from
everyone and everything that ever gave you comfort. Further, the
handling of the production itself carries forth the theme, with the
filmmakers casting away the cinematic conventions generally employed to
manipulate an audience. Far from the kind of formulaic event movie we
usually get around the holidays, "Cast Away" is a nervy exercise in bare
bones storytelling.
It starts in a deceptively traditional fashion, as we meet Chuck Noland
(Tom Hanks), a fiercely dedicated FedEx troubleshooter who travels the
globe preaching the gospel of tight organization and effective time
management to employees. After returning from a successful trip to
Russia, Chuck prepares to enjoy Christmas in Memphis with his
girlfriend, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt, in an understated, winning
performance). But the festivities are interrupted when he is called away
to deal with a problem in Malaysia.
Soon after, Chuck sits in a company plane, gazing at an extra special
gift from Kelly  a stopwatch that once belonged to her grandfather,
with her photo on the inside  while the pilots try to navigate through
a horrific storm over the South Pacific. Suddenly, there is an explosion
and the aircraft crashes into the water below, hurling Chuck beneath the
wreckage. A life raft saves him and he eventually ends up on a small
island several hundred miles from the middle of nowhere.
After the plane crash, a harrowing, realistic sequence nearly as
terrifying as the one in "Fearless," the film's presentation style
shifts almost as radically as Chuck's circumstances. Director Robert
Zemeckis, working with Tom Hanks for the first time since "Forrest
Gump," takes no easy outs. Where the camera shifted relentlessly during
the Russian segment, mirroring the troubleshooter's agitated state of
mind, it barely moves once Chuck crawls onto the island. For the next
hour or so, there is no background music; no cutaways to loved ones
worrying back in Memphis, nothing but a stark, intelligent portrait of a
man trying to get by.
In interviews for the film, Tom Hanks acknowledged that some of the
creative team grew dispirited when "Survivor" became a TV phenomenon,
fearing that their years of hard work might be undermined by the game
show. In fact, "Survivor" probably helped the production by showing that
life on a beautiful tropical island is far more difficult that it looks.
After viewing the struggles of the 16 contestants, the notion of a man
facing such challenges alone seems even more daunting.
Hanks gained 30 plus pounds to prepare for the role. After the early
island scenes were shot, the film closed down for a year, allowing the
actor time to drop the weight. Hanks' physical transformation is quite
impressive, but his extraordinary acting makes it pale by comparison.
His performance is completely down to earth and unaffected. At no point
does it feel like we are witnessing an actor trying to writhe his way to
another Oscar. Instead, we simply watch Chuck try to find drinking
water, crack a coconut without tools and build a fire. His trials are
fascinating and his silence amplifies the gravity of the situation.
Once Chuck has taken care of his bodily needs, he must focus on staying
sane. He keeps the photo of Kelly on constant display, giving himself
someone to long for. Although he salvages a number of FedEx parcels and
makes smart use of their contents, he leaves one package unopened and
ready for delivery, giving himself a task that must some day be taken
care of. Not a spiritual man (when the body of a crew member washes
ashore, he buries it without prayer, looking at the makeshift grave and
flatly muttering, "Well, that's it."), Chuck recognizes that he must
have someone to talk to and comes up with an ingenious solution.
Ads for the movie make it clear that Chuck eventually returns to
civilization (I suspect Zemeckis revealed that piece of information so
that viewers would remain in the moment instead of fretting about
whether or not Chuck would ever get home). As for what happens, suffice
to say that the ending does not betray the integrity of what has come
before.
It will be interesting to see if mass audiences embrace "Cast Away."
Some may find the underlying world-view too bleak, but my guess is that
the goodwill Tom Hanks engenders will carry them through. By the way,
you'll need to set aside a little over two hours and 20 minutes for the
film, but rest assured, you will not be bored for a second.

Following a sneak preview for "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," 
several friends asked my opinion of the comedy. When I shrugged it off as 
merely "okay," the disappointment and annoyance in their eyes was 
unmistakable. Like so many others, they were psyched up for this sequel 
to the 1997 spoof and eager to play the "Austin Powers" game, tossing 
around catch phrases like "Yeah, baby, yeah," "shagadelic," and "Oh, 
behave!" Then along comes Movie Boy to rain on their parade.
I freely admit to being mystified over the immense popularity that has 
built up around "Austin Powers." A modest success when released 
theatrically, the film went on to become a huge hit on video. Perhaps 
repeated viewings add to the enjoyment of the absurdist humor. Whatever. 
I watched the original only once and found it intermittently funny, but 
too thin to warrant a second look. I feel the same way about the sequel. 
Packed with gags -- some clever, many lame and almost all puerile -- the 
film has too many dead spots between the laughs, and I caught myself 
checking my watch almost as often as I chuckled. In other words, "Austin 
Powers 2" is "okay."
But "okay" isn't good enough for fans caught up in Powers-mania. While 
many have complained about the unrelenting hype for "Star Wars: The 
Phantom Menace," few seem bothered by the massive barrage of ads for this 
film. Granted, some of the commercials are a hoot, but still, the 
ubiquitous advertising campaign left me tired of Mike Myers face long 
before entering the theater.
When giving advice to student reviewers at seminars, I urge them to avoid 
the inclusion of lengthy plot descriptions, explaining that writers who 
do so are generally disinterested in the film and merely using a long 
synopsis as a lazy way to pad the word count of their article. With that 
in mind, here is a lengthy plot description of "Austin Powers: The Spy 
Who Shagged Me."
The film begins in 1999, with freeze-dried '60s super-spy Powers (Mike 
Myers, who also plays Dr. Evil, a Scottish thug called Fat Bastard, and a 
'60s guru) honeymooning with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) when 
he discovers that his new bride is actually a "fembot" with a bomb 
planted in her noggin. Single again, Powers learns that his nemesis, Dr. 
Evil, has returned from outer space with a new diabolical scheme to wreck 
havoc. Using a time machine (with enjoyably cheesy visuals straight out 
of "The Time Tunnel"), Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 and steals Austin 
Powers' "mojo," leaving the oh-so-groovy secret agent impotent in all 
senses of the word.
But, thanks to British Intelligence, Austin Powers also has access to a 
time machine, in the form of a psychedelic Volkswagen Beetle (his travel 
mode echoes that of the "Back to the Future" trilogy). So he returns to 
the Swinging Sixties to regain his virility and stop Dr. Evil from 
destroying the world. Along the way, Powers picks up a new love interest, 
American CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who joins him 
on his biggest adventure yet. 
NOTE: The preceding plot description ate up 188 words -- not bad, not bad 
at all.
In "Austin Powers'" scattershot screenplay are a number of undeniably 
entertaining scenes. Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) appears on a Jerry 
Springer Show episode titled "My Father Is Evil and Wants to Take Over 
the World," only to have his dad make a surprise appearance that, 
naturally, leads to a brawl. Jerry Springer segments in movies have been 
done to death, but this one is nicely-executed and plays well. 
A particularly witty scene has Powers addressing the audience directly, 
saying "You know what's amazing is how England looks in no way like 
southern California" just prior to a fight obviously set in the southern 
California hills, with a red British phone booth incongruously placed on 
the side of the road for "authenticity." 
My favorite bit shows Dr. Evil piloting a spaceship that resembles male 
genitalia, with rapid-cuts of various characters' reactions to the sight 
(a radar operator says "It looks like a giant..." then the film cuts to a 
fighter pilot shouting "Dick! Dick, look out to starboard!" and so forth).
 The sequence is juvenile as hell and very funny.
A lot of the movie falls flat, however. Endless segues of a go-go dancing 
Powers grow tiresome, and Heather Graham lacks comic spark. The visuals 
of Dr. Evil's tiny clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), are amusing, but 
Troyer's limited acting skills mute the humorous potential. A reprise of 
a hilarious scene from the first film, depicting Austin frolicking nude 
with objects strategically placed to cover his "naughty parts," fails to 
amuse because you can see the "Cops"-style optical blur placed over his 
genitals.
Of course, "Austin Powers" is a critic-proof movie. Fans will drink in 
every second, quote the catch-phrases like crazy and wonder why a spoil-
sport like me bothered to critique their movie.

Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget 
Fonda, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. 2:35.
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott

In the three long years since the release of the dazzling "Pulp Fiction," 
Quentin Tarantino fans have wondered if the maverick director has still 
got it. The answer is yes, but he's really slowed it down. "Jackie Brown",
 adapted from Elmore Leonard's 1995 best-seller "Rum Punch," is a 
sluggish, but satisfying character study masked as a crime caper. While 
Tarantino's revered hair-trigger pacing is absent, he reveals new depths 
of filmmaking skill, while presenting some exceptionally well-drawn 
characters. The film hints at a level of substance beyond his trademark 
barrage of pop culture references punctuated with flashy violence. It 
appears that little Quentin may actually be growing up just a bit.
Closely adhering to Leonard's novel, while adding his own unique sense of 
flair, Tarantino introduces Jackie Brown (Pam Grier,) a middle-aged 
flight attendant in a heap of trouble. Caught transporting money and 
cocaine into the States from Mexico, Brown faces a stint in prison unless 
she gives up the identity of the man she's working for. Unfortunately, 
that man is weapons dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson,) an 
extremely violent type with a penchant for murdering snitches. Faced with 
the prospect of jail or death, Brown proposes setting up a sting with ATF 
agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) to nail Robbie. Meeting with Robbie, 
she proposes using the sting to double-cross the cops, while slipping a 
half million dollars into the country right under their noses. Then she 
huddles with bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) and asks for his 
help in twisting the sting into an elaborate triple-cross. If successful, 
Brown could get Robbie out of her life and end up with a great deal of 
money, but the set-up is risky in a dozen different ways. And so the 
caper begins.
Tarantino takes his own sweet time getting to the caper, devoting a good 
stretch of the film to an up-close-and-personal look at Ordell Robbie, a 
fast-talking hustler who is both riveting and repulsive. Samuel L. 
Jackson, one of the great actors of our time, is electric here, creating 
a hyper-active viper with an oily charisma. Almost as disturbing as his 
bursts of intense violence is his incessant use of the word "nigger," 
which pops up literally dozens of times during his staccato harangues. 
Tarantino may think lobbing the word around provides street credibility, 
but his fascination with the term feels juvenile and offensive. 
Robbie's right-hand man is Louis Gara (Robert De Niro,) a quiet ex-con 
more interested in getting stoned with Melanie (Bridget Fonda,) a 
girlfriend and shill of Robbie's, than in taking care of business. 
Jackson and De Niro are a colorful pair, though nowhere near as 
interesting as Jackson and John Travolta's Jules and Vincent in "Pulp 
Fiction."
Far more engaging are the characters of Jackie Brown and Max Cherry, 
wonderfully realized by Pam Grier and Robert Forster, the latest pair of 
actors to receive career resuscitation from Tarantino. Grier, a 70's pop 
icon as star of "Foxy Brown" and a host of blaxploitation flicks, is 
compelling in the film's lead role. Jackie Brown is a handsome middle-
aged woman whose great poise masks the despair and desperation she feels. 
Trapped in a low-paying, dead-end job with a small airline, she realizes 
that the clock is ticking and her options for success are extremely 
limited. Her legal crisis forces her to confront a bleak future, and take 
what could be her last big chance.
Robert Forster, who starred in "Banyon" and other forgettable 70s TV fare,
 exhibits a subtle, smoky charm as world-weary bail-bondsman Max Cherry. 
Another victim of middle-age malaise, Cherry trudges through life with 
dead eyes, until he meets Brown. Instantly smitten, he finds himself 
tempted to break free of his own dreary pattern of existence. When the 
two are together, they discuss little things, such as the weight gain 
that often comes when one stops smoking, but there's something bigger 
going on. They're really talking about their fear of aging and being 
alone, of regrets and missed opportunities. Mostly, they're testing the 
waters with each other, to try and determine if it's worth taking the 
chance of feeling again.  
That's pretty heady stuff for Quentin Tarantino, whose work in "Reservoir 
Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" was sharp as a knife, but tended to lack depth. 
Using his camera more subtly than ever and employing lots of extreme 
close-ups, Tarantino deals with intimacy in a way he never has before. At 
two hours and thirty five minutes, "Jackie Brown" lags in spots, lacking 
the peaks and valleys necessary to sustain its length. Despite its 
difficulties with pacing, though, "Jackie Brown" is ample proof that 
Quentin Tarantino continues to grow as one of America's brightest 
filmmakers. Now if he'd just ease up on the "nigger" business...

To best enjoy "Yi Yi," I suggest you do the following: Stay in your car
for a moment when you arrive at the theater. Breathe in and out
deliberately, allowing your system to slow down. Remind yourself that
movies can be more than rapid-fire edits, explosions and dick jokes.
Continue the conscious breathing until you feel relaxed and centered,
then proceed to the box office.
Set in contemporary Taiwan, "Yi Yi" is a rich look at a middle class
Taipei family. Written and directed by the very talented Edward Yang,
the film (his seventh, but the first to be distributed in America)
presents a glossy family portrait as a completed jigsaw puzzle, then
begins removing the pieces. With affection and an unflinching lens, he
reveals the vast distances between people who are supposedly very close.
At the center of it all is Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), a bright-eyed
8-year-old boy with a habit of asking hard questions ("Daddy, I can't
see what you see and you can't see what I see. How can we know more than
half the truth?"). After numerous adults pat him on the head and move
away, he comes up with his own suppositions and acts on them, using a
camera to make his statement. Yang-Yang takes a series of photos of the
back of people's heads. Asked why, he explains to a subject, "You
couldn't see it, so I showed you."
His relatives are too preoccupied to think about what he has said.
Shortly after a raucous wedding, Yang-Yang's grandmother has a stroke
and goes into a coma. She eventually ends up at home, with doctors
encouraging her loved ones to try and stimulate her senses by talking to
her. The process proves to be more difficult than it sounds. NJ (Wu
Nienjen), the family patriarch, compares it to praying, because "you're
not sure the other party can hear, and you're not sure whether you're
sincere." His wife Min-Min (Elaine Jin) ends up in tears, exclaiming, "I
have nothing to say to Mother. I tell her the same things every day. I
have so little. How can it be so little? I live a blank."
Mom lights out for a mountain temple to meditate, leaving NJ in an even
more surreal space. The electronics executive runs into Sherry (Ke
Suyun), his first love, a woman he has not seen for 30 years. She is as
shattered by the encounter as he, following him to sputter, "Why didn't
you come that day? I waited and waited. I never got over it."
Why we end up with the people we do is a recurring theme in "Yi Yi." And
what if we had made different choices? NJ ponders these questions while
hanging with his friend, Mr. Ota (Issey Ogata), a Japanese games
designer with a gift for classical piano. NJ treats Ota with deference
and something approaching awe  Ota seems to serve the same function as
Min-Min's guru  but there are no obvious answers. He finally calls
Sherry, who wonders aloud, despite the fact that she too is married, if
they should pick up where they left off.
Mind you, this is just one relatively small part of a very large film.
Every member of the family has his or her own set of joys and
challenges, with decidedly more of the latter than the former. Director
Yang gently weaves together their circumstances, leisurely, but not
lazily. "Yi Yi" is nearly three hours long, but the film never lags,
drifting by like a silk ribbon on a breezy day. Yang knows the correct
pace for his story and expects us to be smart enough to adjust to it.
There are pauses inserted throughout the film. At one point he cuts to
an image of clouds against a blue sky and, by my count, holds the shot
for 19 seconds, which would be an eternity in most studio productions.
But pauses like that allow extra time for reflection, and a film like
this offers much upon which to reflect.
Yang further accents his character studies with striking camerawork.
Many scenes are filmed against, or through, reflective glass, presenting
the outside of these interior worlds. Where most directors overuse
close-ups in personal moments, Yang favors medium to long shots and,
rather than distancing the viewer, the placement makes the scenes seem
more intimate. We study the well-composed settings and listen to the
people in the middle that are trying to make sense of the life racing by
them. Watching them makes it a bit easier to put one's own crisis du
jour in context, just one of the many gifts that "Yi Yi" has to offer.

It's just "your basic boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy changes 
underlying social structure" tale, according to Z (Woody Allen), the 
rebellious hero of "Antz," a sophisticated, fun and fast paced computer-
generated feature about life from the insects' point of view. Rush-
released by DreamWorks to reach audiences ahead of Disney's similarly 
themed CGI feature "A Bug's Life," "Antz" clearly learned a valuable 
lesson from the delightful 1995 Disney smash "Toy Story"; that dazzling 
computer graphics are just eye candy unless supported by good acting and 
a solid script.  
"Antz" follows the adventures of Z-4195, a neurotic worker ant who longs 
to assert his individuality. At the conclusion of a counseling session he 
moans "I feel so insignificant" only to have his therapist (Paul 
Mazursky) congratulate him, exclaiming, "you've had a breakthrough. You 
ARE insignificant!" 
Everything changes one fateful night, when spunky Princess Bala (Sharon 
Stone) violates the colony's caste system and goes slumming at a worker 
bar, where she ends up dancing in the arms of an enraptured Z. Determined 
to see her again, Z convinces his best friend, soldier ant Weaver 
(Sylvester Stallone), to change places with him for one day, so that he 
can march past the royalty in a military parade. Unbeknownst to Z, the 
parade troops are slated to lead an assault against an army of termites. 
In short order, Z becomes a hero to the colony, until his lowly status is 
revealed and he ends up fleeing to the outside world, with a furious Bala 
by his side and her fiancée, the treacherous General Mandible (Gene 
Hackman) ordering him caught and killed. As Z desperately tries to avoid 
death, the General inches closer to fulfilling his secret agenda; a 
military coup d'état that will destroy most of the colony.
The computer graphics in "Antz" are imaginative and remarkably detailed. 
While the oddly angular design of the insects' bodies is less than 
attractive, the body movements are credible and the facial expressions 
extremely convincing. The background designs are well-done, particularly 
in outdoor scenes set in Insectopia, the legendary bug paradise. 
Incidentally, watch those scenes for what is quite possibly the most 
blatant product placement of all time.
Wisely, the dialogue in "Antz" is aimed at least as much towards grown-
ups as it is for children. For example, Z suggests that, as an 
alternative to war with the termites, the colony might try "influencing 
their political process with campaign contributions." His struggle for 
individuality in a world of absolute conformity leads to some 
entertaining, if unrealized, socio-political subplots.
The film's cast is impressive, to say the least. Dan Ackroyd and Jane 
Curtain provide laughs as Chip and Muffy, a condescending but well-
intentioned pair of wasps (in both senses of the word). Christopher 
Walken is suitably menacing as Colonel Cutter, and Gene Hackman gives a 
commanding performance as the evil General Mandible. As Z's best friend 
Weaver, Sylvester Stallone is an endearing lug and Sharon Stone does 
solid work as the privileged, but spirited Princess Bala.  
Of course, this is Woody Allen's show, and he immediately trots out the 
patented neurotic shtick on which he built a career. Despite working with 
sharp one-liners, his initial delivery struck me as just more of the same 
old Allen whining. Viewers less familiar with his work may find his 
entire performance fresh, but I felt he was a bit tiresome in the movie's 
early scenes. Luckily, he brightens his voice work as the film progresses,
 becoming much more likable midway through the story.
Writers toss around phrases like "fun for the whole family" far too 
casually, but "Antz" really is a film that should appeal to all ages. 
There are a few battle scenes that may prove too intense for very young 
or sensitive children, so cover their eyes if need be, and prepare to 
actually have fun at a movie with your kids, courtesy of "Antz." And if 
you're a grown-up without children, head for the theater tout-de-suite.

Surreal and visually dazzling, "The Matrix" is one hearty bowl of sci-fi 
goulash. Andy and Larry Wachowski, the brothers behind the sultry lesbian 
gangster flick, "Bound," incorporate everything from John Woo-style 
operatic violence to "Alice in Wonderland" trippiness in this bleak-chic 
extravaganza. The production is extremely derivative, but still great 
gloomy fun. Besides, any filmmakers who can create a story that logically 
incorporates the superhuman fighting techniques from contemporary Hong 
Kong action movies, the freeze-frame, pivoting-camera special effect 
popularized by the swing-dance "Gap" ad, and the chronically dazed look 
on Keanu Reeves' face, are all right in my book. 
Like last year's "Dark City," "The Matrix" explores the very nature of 
reality. "Dark City" is a better film, more successfully creating and 
maintaining a quasi dream state, but "The Matrix" offers plenty of its 
own rewards. With movies like these, it's best to enter the theater with 
no advance knowledge and just let the story flow over you, but since 
feature length mind-fucks aren't everyone's cup of tea, I'll run down the 
basic set-up, if only for the benefit of your date.
(SPOILER ALERT: Reveals significant plot points) Thomas Anderson (Reeves) 
is a clean-cut computer programmer working for a software corporation in 
1999, but the young man leads a secret life. As a hacker called Neo, he 
seeks to ease his nagging discomfort with the way his life feels by 
searching for truth on the ominous fringes of the Internet. Moments 
before the authorities close in, his online mentor Morpheus (Laurence 
Fishburne) urges him to "Follow the white rabbit" if he wishes to avoid 
arrest. Spotting a tattoo of a rabbit on the arm of a young rebel, Neo 
joins her in a wild flight from the Men in Black that leads to a 
shattering revelation.
Neo's existence is a lie, a virtual reality construct devised by a race 
of sentient machines to control mankind. In the distant future, the 
remnants of humanity are kept in fluid pods, with fabricated lives piped 
into their brains. The retro 1999 setting is but a comforting illusion, 
reflecting the last year before the beginning of the fall of our culture. 
In the new millennium, the human race fought, and lost, a long, horrific 
war with the artificial intelligence they created. The machines now use 
people as a power source, and the Matrix is the mechanism to control 
their crop of souls. 
But Morpheus, one of the few remaining free human rebels, has been to the 
Oracle and believes Neo to be "The One," the messiah who will bring 
salvation. Freed from his pod, Neo joins Morpheus and his followers in 
their small ship and undergoes training. He must learn to discard all 
notions of physical limitations in order to plug in and fight the 
machines on the virtual battlefield of metropolitan 1999. But the 
Sentient Agents, led by the sadistic Smith (Hugo Weaving), have their own 
agenda. Using superior intelligence, they will capture the band of 
warriors and snuff out the organic rebellion once and for all (END 
SPOILERS).
The Wachowski boys do a dandy job of making this hooey seem more 
meaningful than it is by deftly working in overtly religious references, 
general undertones of mysticism and loads of technobabble. Thankfully, 
they throw in some humor as well. The story works because the heroes, 
while sketchily drawn, are just distinct enough, and the bad guys are 
deliciously nasty. As Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving is a wicked delight, over-
enunciating as he spits out diatribes about mankind. Laurence Fishburne 
carries the proper sense of authority as the human leader, Gloria Foster 
is utterly disarming as the Oracle, Carrie-Anne Moss makes for a hell of 
a warrior and Keanu Reeves succeeds because his typical stunned persona 
is actually appropriate in this context. 
But style is the real star of "The Matrix" and the film's powerhouse 
combination of grinding music and phenomenal visuals more than make up 
for the soggy plot that goes on a few minutes longer than it should. The 
cast, decked out in way-cool sunglasses, black leather and trenchcoats 
(even in virtual reality, fashion counts), employ a dizzying array of 
gravity-defying gymnastics and martial-arts moves, unlike anything ever 
seen in an American film. In addition to the aforementioned flow-frame 
shots and some unusual morphing effects, the filmmakers use high-speed 
photography, enhanced by computer, to depict characters running up walls, 
delivering impossibly fast punches and kicks, and making incredible leaps,
 sometimes stopping or shifting in mid-air. "The Matrix" is absolutely 
the best live-action realization of comic-book sensibilities to date. You 
may get a headache trying to decipher the ponderous storyline, but the 
amazing imagery will likely soothe your pain.

I cringed while watching the first trailer for Disney's animated
feature, "The Emperor's New Groove." The title was dreadful, sounding
like something concocted by a grandmother trying to be hip. Then there
was the art. When I was little, there were two kind of cartoons: the
cutesy-pie, parent-friendly Disney stuff and the edgier, anti-authority
Warner Brothers fare. The drawings in the "Emperor" commercial looked
like they were stolen from a latter day, cut-rate Warner Brothers
feature. But what really got me was the voice of the lead character. It
only took one word for my internal alarm bells to go off as I recognized
the smug tones of David Spade.
David Spade, the sarcastic troll from "Saturday Night Live." David
Spade, the smarmy creep who periodically appeared on "Weekend Update"
doing commentary on Hollywood figures, taking cheap shots at easy
targets  as if the talent-impaired twerp was in a position to pass
judgment on anybody. David Spade, who dared to strut around acting
superior in Chris Farley movies before making "Lost & Found," his own
wretched feature film. How can there be atheists in a world where David
Spade parleys snideness into a career, thus offering proof that there
truly is a Devil who trade favors for souls?
I went into the screening of "The Emperor's New Groove" expecting the
worst, but emerged with a smile. By Disney standards, the art is weak.
The drawing style and comic sensibilities are indeed ripped off from
Warner Brothers. And David Spade is in virtually every one of the
production's 79 minutes. But despite it all, "The Emperor's New Groove"
is fun, almost solely due to inspired casting of the voices behind the
drawings, including, much as I hate to admit it, David Spade.
The project went through major changes. Originally titled "Kingdom of
the Sun," it was to have been a typically lavish Disney musical, a grand
romantic comedy in which the emperor was but a supporting player.
Somewhere along the developmental course, the production lost its main
concept, lead characters and a handful of songs by Sting (a couple of
his tunes remain; one at the beginning and the other over the closing
credits).
The revised version tells a simple tale. Kuzco (Spade), the bratty,
arrogant young emperor of an Inca-like empire, is targeted for
assassination by his advisor, the wicked Yzma (Eartha Kitt). But Yzma
and Kronk (Patrick Warburton), her chronically preoccupied assistant,
grab the wrong bottle and, instead of poisoning their leader, they turn
him into a llama. Kuzco runs for his life and ends up with Pacha (John
Goodman), a gentle soul from a peasant village. Due to his belief in the
goodness of the human heart, Pacha agrees to help Kuzco avoid Yzma,
return to the castle and regain his throne.
The film starts off slow, with Spade oozing sarcasm during a torturous
opening monologue. In stark contrast to most Disney offerings, the
drawings feature almost no background details. As a result, the
characters initially come off like figures doing stand-up comedy on an
animated stage (Oddly enough, just as I noted the production's broad,
Las Vegas feel, one of the film's two songs began, crooned by none other
than Tom Jones). In addition to the lack of background details, the
empire is also noticeably underpopulated. Including soldiers and
villagers, I counted less than thirty people in the whole movie. Perhaps
the bulk of the population recognized the voice of their leader and
moved.
After the set-up and song, the production soon turns into a buddy
comedy, with Kuzco and Pacha squabbling and then bonding, while Yzma and
Kronk try to track them down. Most of the slapstick works, although the
writers toss in two ancient, unwelcome gags about male intimacy, one
involving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the other a simple hug. Both
times, two guys get close, then panic and bolt away from each other,
muttering macho phrases while skittering about nervously. Not only do
the jokes reinforce homophobia, but they are also lame recreations of
the legendary pillow scene in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles."
Thankfully, the casting is light years better than those scenes. As the
cruel, immature emperor Kuzco, Spade is, of course, perfect. John
Goodman, meanwhile, lends his warm, deep tones to the gentle giant
Pacha. Because of the character's innocent nature, Goodman gets
relatively few one-liners, but he proves a welcome balm to Spade's
acidity.
As is the norm in cartoons, the villains get the best lines. Eartha Kitt
is excellent as the wicked Yzma, upping the metallic edge of her voice
to great effect, managing to give even her quietest line readings the
sense of a coiled snake ready to strike. But even the remarkable Eartha
gets upstaged by Patrick Warburton, who casually steals the movie as
Kronk, a lovable henchman more interested in emulating Martha Stewart
than doing evil. Warburton delighted audiences as David Puddy on
"Seinfeld" and corporate-shark-turned-hobo Johnny Johnson on
"NewsRadio," and he underplays his lines here beautifully. The man has a
unique gift for comedy and is destined for greatness.
Disney clearly invested little effort on "The Emperor's New Groove," but
the film is still a minor success, courtesy of Warburton, Kitt, Goodman
and Spade. If the movie turns out to be a hit, I hope the company is
smart enough to send large bonus checks to the foursome. And if they
decide to give each of the others a bigger cut than Spade, that's fine
with me too.

"The Filth and the Fury" is the third film about the Sex Pistols. Not
bad for a band that was barely together for two years and only recorded
one studio album. "The Sex Pistols had to end when it did," says
frontman John "Johnny Rotten" Lydon, "but it didn't have to end how it
did." He's right, of course, which is what makes this documentary so
fascinating.
The Sex Pistols came along at the perfect time. They weren't the first
punk band, or the best, but they were certainly the most explosive.
Relatively few people ever saw the group perform (they were banned in
Britain for a time and toured their homeland as SPOTS  Sex Pistols On
Tour Secretly), but their impact was immense. Even in America, where
they received scant attention from the general public, the band served
as an early warning to the purveyors of leaden '70s corporate rock that
change was on its way.
For years, Sex Pistol manager Malcolm McLaren has claimed that the group
was his creation, a sort-of punk rock version of the Monkees. Julien
Temple's crackling, multimedia documentary gives the surviving Sex
Pistols a chance to tell their side of the story. The truth probably
lies somewhere in-between McLaren's version and theirs, but that takes
nothing away from this rousing feature.
All of the most notorious moments from the Sex Pistols' rise and fall
are here: their headline-making, obscenity filled appearance on an
English talk show, their performance of the blissfully obnoxious "God
Save the Queen" on the river Thames during the celebration of Queen
Elizabeth's silver anniversary jubilee, even their abbreviated final
concert at San Francisco's Winterland in January 1978. The footage is
accompanied by recently recorded commentary from Lydon, guitarist Steve
Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Temple shows the men
only in silhouette, which helps to keep the focus of the production
squarely in the glory days. Doomed bassist Sid Vicious also appears, in
an interview shot a few months before his death from a heroin overdose.
Thankfully, Temple doesn't lionize the band. They appear as they were; a
group of immature boys who, while striking out blindly in all
directions, made one of the most vital, dynamic albums in the history of
rock and roll.
In addition to the expected music and mayhem, there are several
surprises, including the normally snotty Lydon showing actual human
feelings while discussing the death of Sid Vicious (of course, he could
be faking  with an attention whore like Lydon, you can never be sure).
The best scene has the Sex Pistols appearing at a benefit for the
children of striking firefighters. Watching the cheerful interactions
between the punks and the little ones is worth the price of admission
alone.

Don't expect an in-depth look at "Legally Blonde" here. Doing a critical
analysis of this movie would be akin to dissecting tofu. "Legally
Blonde" is fizzy and featherweight, an underachieving, yet affable
cousin to "Clueless" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion." The
movie has two things going for it. First, the filmmakers clearly realize
they are making a formulaic, crowd-pleasing girl power movie and they
know how to do it. Second, Reese Witherspoon is so gifted that she finds
and maintains the perfect balance between her character's air-headed
presentation style and her underlying strength and smarts.
Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is the ever-smiling queen of her school.
Bedecked in a seemingly endless series of kicky outfits (with the
highlight on pink), she was Miss June in the campus calendar and a
runner-up for Miss Hawaiian Tropic. Elle is also totally devoted to her
boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis). When he asks her to dinner at their
special place, she is sure he is going to pop the question.
Instead, he calmly informs her their relationship is over. As a young
man with political aspirations about to attend the Harvard School of
Law, he requires a girlfriend that is more serious and less blonde. At
first, Elle is devastated, but she quickly comes up with a plan,
informing her girlfriends (who appear to exist solely to fuss over her)
that she will win Warner back by proving she is good enough. How? By
attending Harvard Law School as well.
She gets admitted to the prestigious school by studying hard and
submitting a bubbly admissions video (directed by a Coppola!), only to
be treated with contempt by her fellow students, particularly Warner's
new girlfriend, Vivian (Selma Blair). As is that isn't enough,
Professors Callahan (Victor Garber) and Stromwell (Holland Taylor) treat
her like an addled child.
But never fear, because Elle has girl power! She becomes friends with
Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), a klutzy manicurist, and wins the respect
of Emmett (Luke Wilson), Callahan's right-hand man. Before you know it,
she has her trial by fire, as the defense attorney (don't ask how) for
an informercial fitness guru (Ali Larter) on trial for murder.
The whole thing is just as idiotic as it sounds, but the filmmakers
understand their target audience and give them what they want in spades.
There are two adorable dogs (large portions of the audience went "Awww"
at least three times), a couple of montages set to pop songs and even a
dance number. Every character does exactly what you expect them to do
and the giddy ending is as obvious as every other element in the film.
"Legally Blonde" is mildly enjoyable precisely because it is so
predictable (comfortable as an old shoe, you know), and because Reese
Witherspoon can make almost anything play better than expected.

Picture Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan smooching on a sunny day in a gorgeous New 
York City flower garden while "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" plays in the 
background. Imagine Jean Stapleton saying "I tried to have cybersex once, 
but I kept getting a busy signal." If the two previous sentences made 
your stomach turn, keep reading. If, on the other hand, you found the 
Hanks/Ryan image just darling and the Stapleton quip too cute for words, 
get as far away from this review as possible, because my critique of the 
insufferably cutesy-poo "You've Got Mail" will likely give you a headache.
"You've Got Mail" may be the ultimate chick flick. It wouldn't surprise 
me if the ushers required any males attending the film to check their 
balls at the door. During this excruciating exercise, I heard waves of 
female giggling, laughing and "Aww-ing," plus a hearty round of applause 
at the end. At no time did any man in the audience make a sound. Whether 
this was because they were stunned, sickened or sleeping I cannot say. 
I will say this: "You've Got Mail" will delight people who use writing 
paper with bunnies on it. I guarantee that some hack critic will describe 
the film as "a delightful, frothy holiday confection." "You've Got Mail" 
is for people who embroider toaster cozies, fasten "Garfield" cartoons to 
their refrigerators with ceramic magnets that look like food, and don't 
change the channel when that insufferable Celine Dion "Titanic" song pops 
up yet again on the radio. As for the rest of us, this is the sort of 
movie that could throw even non-diabetics into sugar shock.
Meg Ryan twinkles non-stop as the proprietor of an unbelievably quaint 
children's bookstore in Manhattan. Neighborhood kiddies sit enraptured 
when she dresses-up as the chronically-adorable "Storybook Lady" and 
reads to them, while her band of lovable rag-tag employees exchange one-
liners straight out of "Caroline in the City." At night, after Meg's 
cuddly curmudgeon boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) goes to bed, she races to the 
computer, where she waxes rhapsodic with her anonymous online guy pal. 
During an endless stream of product placements for America Online, the 
playpen for countless Internet twerps, Meg and her secret sweetie 
exchange winsome observations about life in the Big Apple ("Don't you 
love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies"). Are 
you gagging yet?
Ah, but there's trouble in Pepperland. Meg's online honey-bunny is Tom 
Hanks, an executive of a evil corporation that runs a chain of soulless 
mega-bookstores. In standard movie coincidence fashion, his next Uber-
store is slated to open, you guessed it, right next to Meg's cuddly-
wuddly shop. The two continue their online flirt-a-thon, blissfully 
unaware that in real life they are bitter business enemies. Goodness 
gracious, how ironic!
Director Nora Ephron, who teamed with Hanks and Ryan for "Sleepless in 
Seattle," co-wrote the script for this remake of "The Shop Around the 
Corner," which doesn't contain a single sentence that any actual human 
being would ever say in a million years. The painfully mannered dialogue 
plays like the first draft of a flop Neil Simon play, made even more 
irritating by Ephron's coy direction. From the first shot of Meg Ryan, 
mugging for the camera while the soundtrack plays the kind of saccharin 
music most often heard in movies with chimps or the Olsen twins, it's 
clear that Ephron is aiming this fluff at those who consider "Touched By 
An Angel" high art.
It gets even worse. Hanks enjoys a VH1 moment at a colorful street fair, 
frolicking with a couple of kids. Ryan tries to psych herself up for a 
confrontation by engaging in a cute-as-a-kitten session of shadow-boxing, 
triggering fits of tittering from the women seated around me. I could go 
on, but just writing about this noxious movie is making me woozy. 
Before anyone fires off an angry letter on their sky blue note paper with 
teddy bears on the borders, let me assure you that I am not the Grinch 
that stole Christmas. I love "It's A Wonderful Life," and the romantic 
comedy, "The Philadelphia Story," and "Local Hero," a whimsical tale 
packed with quirky characters, is one of my all-time favorite films. The 
difference between those movies and "You've Got Mail" is simple. They 
have style and class, while "You've Got Mail" is pure goo, a frilly 
Hallmark card with icing, whipped cream and a cherry on top. As soon as I 
got home from enduring this concoction, I slapped a copy of "L.A. 
Confidential" into the VCR, because exposure to a toxic offering like 
"You've Got Mail" requires a severe and immediate antidote. 
P.S. If you thought "You've Got Mail" was wonderful and are steaming over 
this review, let me ask you one question. If Tom really loved Meg and saw 
that his mega-store was about to drive her children's bookstore out of 
business, why didn't he simply stop carrying children's books and 
instruct his staff to direct customers to Meg's place? His business could 
easily withstand the minute drop in revenue, her business would continue 
to thrive and it would have been the decent thing to do. Think about that 
while you're rearranging the figurines on your toilet tank doily, girls.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
On the surface, "Frequency" is a cross between a time travel fantasy and
a murder mystery, but at its core, the film is an unabashed love letter
to fatherhood. While the plot mechanics are convoluted, to say the least
(I've seen the movie twice and I'm still sorting it out), "Frequency"
left me with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, due mostly to the
performances of Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel.
Caviezel plays John Sullivan, a New York police officer who never fully
recovered from the loss of his father, Frank (Quaid), a firefighter who
died a hero when John was six years old. On an October night in 1999,
the eve of the 30th anniversary of that fateful day when Frank entered a
burning warehouse and never came out, John fiddles with Dad's old ham
radio and strikes up a conversation with a congenial guy from his
neighborhood in Queens.
To his amazement, John soon realizes that the person on the other end of
the radio is his father. A freak series of sunspots has somehow cut
across time, creating a radio link between 1999 and 1969. During their
initial chat, John blurts out a warning to the disbelieving man about
his pending demise. "If you'd just gone the other way, you would have
made it," he shouts as the connection fades.
The next day, Frank finds himself in the warehouse fire described the
night before. At the crucial moment, he heeds the warning and, going
against his instincts, turns the opposite direction in a blazing hallway
and emerges from the inferno alive and well.
Unfortunately, the temporal change leads to disaster. Because of an
incident triggered by Frank's survival, a serial killer that slaughtered
three women in the original timeline has now murdered 10, including
John's mother, Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell). Swapping information over the
decades, John and Frank frantically struggle to discover the identity of
the madman, so they can prevent the murder from happening.
Confused? Well, so was I. For a time travel story to work, the writer
must carefully think through the paradoxes and then find a way to make
them comprehensible to the viewer. I spent the better part of an hour
discussing the internal logic of "Frequency" with a friend and, while
she believes the writer has his cards in order, I remain less than fully
convinced.
But that's okay, because the rewards of the film come not from the time
travel business, but from the portrait of a son reaching out for his
dad. John is a good man and a fine officer, but the loss of his father
left a void that nothing else has filled. I can relate. My father passed
away 14 months ago and, whenever something interesting turns up on the
news, I still catch myself reaching for the phone to call him. My son,
who is also coping with the loss, recently told me "I wish we could make
phone calls to Heaven." In a fashion, "Frequency" fulfills that wish,
and it's hard not to choke up when hearing Frank say "Tell me about your
life, son."
Dennis Quaid is wonderful as Frank, the ideal dad. Described by his wife
as a "big kid," he splits his time between his noble profession and his
beloved family, serving as a terrific role model. Quaid's performance is
so genuine that his occasionally strained "New Yawk" accent is easy to
overlook. Jim Caviezel does fine work as well, effectively conveying the
angst of a man who goes through all the right motions, but still feels a
void inside. The supporting cast members are uniformly strong, although
they are given relatively little to do.
While Toby Emmerich's script includes some exceptional moments, it would
have been better served without the serial killer plot line. Of course,
to propel the story, something bad must happen when Frank's survival
changes time, but the murder angle has been covered in other time travel
movies, and with better clarity. Surely, Emmerich could have cooked up a
more novel crisis.
Director Gregory Hoblit presents the complex screenplay as
straightforwardly as possible. Beautifully photographed, the images are
often lyrical, particularly an overhead montage of young John riding his
bicycle in circles on the street. Hoblit adds intimacy to scenes of John
and Frank talking over the 30-year gap by superimposing both of their
faces onto the screen. He also uses special effects with restraint, a
welcome change from most contemporary movies. Come to think of it, "a
welcome change" is a fitting overall description of "Frequency." Flawed
though it may be, this is a story that delivers when it counts.

This review will be shorter than normal, because there's not a lot to
say about "The Closet," and that's just fine. Light as a soufflé, the
subtitled French farce takes a simple premise and runs with it. Ten
minutes after you leave the theater, you likely won't remember a thing
about "The Closet," except that it gave you one big belly laugh, several
chuckles and a lot of smiles.
The set up: After 20 years of faithful service at the rubber factory,
François Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is about to be let go. The company has
nothing against the man; he is simply so unmemorable that sacking him
seems an easy way to cut costs. When Pignon tells new neighbor Belone
(Michel Aumont) about his pending fate, the elderly fellow cooks up an
idea: Doctor a photo to make it look as if Pignon is gay, then send it
anonymously to his workplace. Once word spreads around the company,
management will be afraid to fire him and open themselves to charges of
bigotry.
So, despite being 100% heterosexual, Pignon comes out of the closet, and
everything changes. Felix (Gerard Depardieu), a co-worker who bullied
Pignon in the past, becomes fearful that he will fired for being
homophobic and desperately tries to befriend the bewildered man. Other
co-workers who dismissed Pignon as hopelessly bland now decide that it
was all part of his cover. Pignon's sullen teenage son Franck (Stanislas
Crevillen) decides that Dad is now interesting, and his supervisor, Mlle
Bertrand (Michele Laroque) finds him intriguing as well. Meanwhile,
Belone, who was once fired for being gay, savors the irony of the
situation.
That's really all there is to it. As farces go, "The Closet" isn't
ambitious. The film offers no grand statements, just a clever idea and
exceptional cast. In a summer of cinematic disappointments, this modest
offering is a cool drink of water.

Title
Review for Crash (1996)
Rated NC-17, One and one half out of five stars.
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
A Nordic blonde glances repeatedly into her rear-view mirror. She sees 
her husband following closely. Suddenly, he accelerates and taps her car 
with his. He pulls back, then hits her car again, harder. When he rams 
her car a third time, she veers wildly; barely maintaining control of her 
vehicle. Is this scene depicting an attempt at murder? No. In David 
Cronenberg's "Crash," this is foreplay.
Based on J.G. Ballard's 1973 novel, "Crash" is about a group of people 
who are sexually aroused by car wrecks. The highly controversial NC-17 
film won a special jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival, for 
"originality, daring and audacity." Ted Turner, owner of Fine Line, the 
company distributing the film, has been quite vocal about his utter 
disgust with the movie. Nationally, General Cinema has refused to run 
"Crash" in any of their theaters.
All this fuss is intriguing, of course, and may tempt you to check out 
the film. Don't. To put it as succinctly as possible, "Crash" is 
pretentious crap. David Cronenberg has been cranking out similar creep 
shows for years. He specializes in nightmare visions of sex merged with 
technology, heavily spiced with close ups of wounds and surgical 
instruments. Occassionally he hits pay dirt. His remake of "The Fly" was 
a spellbinding mixture of horror and romance. But more often, as with 
"Videodrome" and "Dead Ringers," Cronenberg simply produces trumped-up, 
pseudo-intellectual versions of the kind of Grade Z gore-fests that 
littered drive-ins back in the 60's. 
As for the plot, "Crash" barely has one. James Spader loses control of 
his car and hits another vehicle head-on, killing the other driver and 
leaving the driver's wife (Holly Hunter) seriously injured. While 
hospitalized, Spader meets Hunter's "friend" Vaughn (Elias Koteas,) a 
grotesquely-scarred performance artist who stages reenactments of famous 
celebrity crashes. Spader and wife Deborah Unger (the kind of ice queen 
that frequently popped up in Hitchcock films) quickly become members of 
Vaughn's car-sex cult. Then everyone in the cast  wrecks cars and screws 
each other for an hour and a half. The end.
There's a lot of sex in "Crash" and most of it is repellent. The most 
disgusting moment (and there are so many to choose from) comes when 
Spader hooks up with Rosanna Arquette, a horribly mutilated cult member 
bedecked with leg braces and lots of leather, and has sex with her 
scarred-over wound.
Vaughn is the erotic center of the group. The cultists dote on his 
mangled body and listen intently to his whispered babble. "Crashes mingle 
the sexual energy of the dead with the living," Vaughn murmurs, "creating 
an intensity that sets the latter apart from, for lack of a better 
description, safer drivers." Early on, he tells Spader he's involved in 
"the reshaping of the human body by modern technology." Later, he 
confesses that his statement was "just a test," to see if Spader was 
ready for the *really* heavy stuff. Eventually, everyone in the cast has 
sex with Vaughn. After all, who could resist a guy like that?
"Crash" has a slow, deliberately mechanical feel. The emotionally stunted 
characters show no despair over the death of one of their own, merely 
regretting that they didn't get to watch. They rarely make eye contact 
during sex. They rarely even act like people; it's as if they are all 
various aspects of one terribly sad personality.
The consensus of opinion is that "Crash" is a cautionary tale, suggesting 
that our culture has grown so jaded that we must go to sick extremes to 
reach any vague semblance of satisfaction. Supposedly, Cronenberg has 
used these offensive images to force the viewer into examining the nature 
of sexual obsession, without being distracted by anything genuinely 
erotic. I doubt it. David Cronenberg has used these images repeatedly 
throughout his career for a reason. I suspect that he gets off on this 
stuff, that these images of wounds, surgical instruments and the like 
reflect what turns him on. I suspect "Crash" has no message, that 
Cronenberg is simply pulling pictures from some dark corner of his soul 
and putting them on film because he can. But you don't have to watch him 
do it.

"There's Something About Mary" is gross and offensive. It's poorly paced, 
often sluggish and about a half hour too long. A lot of the comedy bits 
fall flat and the ones that do work depend on shock value, mining cheap 
laughs from animal abuse, bodily fluids, pratfalls, humiliation and 
injury, while mocking physically and mentally handicapped people along 
with the elderly. Disgusting and utterly juvenile, "There's Something 
About Mary" is also the funniest film I've seen in a very long time. So 
sue me.
Created by the Farrelly brothers, the "visionaries" who gave the world 
"Dumb and Dumber" and "Kingpin," "There's Something About Mary" is the 
kind of no-holds-barred comedy reminiscent of "Blazing Saddles," "Animal 
House" and "Airplane." It's not really in the same league, though. The 
humor in those films was consistent, while "There's Something About Mary" 
only hits the high marks occasionally, with a lot of dead spots in-
between. Oh, but when it works, this puppy is absolutely hilarious.
The story begins in 1985, when Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller), a dorky high-
school student, bonds with the radiant Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz) when he 
attempts to rescue her retarded brother Warren (W. Earl Brown) from a 
bully. Mary asks Ted to the prom and everything's coming up roses for the 
love-struck doofus until that fateful prom night when disaster hits, 
courtesy of a nightmarish escalating series of blunders, culminating in a 
zipper accident of historic proportions.
Cut to 13 years later, when Ted takes the suggestion of his friend Dom 
(Chris Elliott) and hires private eye Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out 
where Mary is living. The sleazy detective locates Mary in Miami and 
promptly falls for her. After feeding Ted bogus info to dissuade him from 
pursuing his lost love, Pat uses eavesdropping devices to learn what Mary 
wants in a man, then attempts to become that guy. Meanwhile, Ted learns 
the truth and heads south to try and pick up where he left off before 
that awful night with the zipper.
That's a lot of plot for a comedy and "There's Something About Mary" gets 
sluggish while trying to juggle all of its subplots and characters. 
Speaking of characters, the Farrelly boys aren't exactly famous for well 
drawn ones, and the film spends too much time getting up close and 
personal with some pretty sketchy people. 
When the Farrellys wrench themselves away from the romantic contrivances 
and focus on the big jokes, "There's Something About Mary" kicks into 
high gear. The film contains a generous number of elaborate low-humor set 
pieces that pay off wonderfully, because of the brothers' willingness to 
take things way, way, way over the top. They set up a tasteless gag, then 
carry it light years further than most comic filmmakers would dare. 
The zipper scene, for example, succeeds precisely because of overkill. 
Instead of settling for one painful laugh when poor Ted gets his package 
lodged in those cruel metal teeth, they keep pushing the envelope. Mary's 
father comes to help, humiliating the boy with his horrified double-take. 
Then he calls in Mom for a look-see, as the boy tries desperately to 
crawl behind the wallpaper. Then the police and firefighters arrive. Just 
when you think it's impossible to carry the gruesome joke any farther, 
they do, by giving us an explicit look at Ted's mangled genitals. Oh, the 
humanity!
If you think that's disgusting, skip this movie, because the Farrellys 
are just getting warmed up. There's also the drugged dog scene, the gay 
rest stop scene, the fish hook scene, the leather-skinned old woman's 
bare breast scene, and an extremely gross, incredibly funny masturbation 
bit that delivers one of the film's most side-splitting laughs, thanks to 
Mary's blissfully cheerful ignorance of the ickiness around her.
All the gags don't work, of course. The Farrellys have a fixation with 
facial blemishes and the zit and hives visuals aren't particularly funny. 
Most of the jokes mocking Mary's retarded brother Warren fall flat. The 
audience at the screening I attended were clearly resistant to the whole 
notion of making fun of the disabled. When the film was laughing with 
Warren, they the audience joined in. When it laughed at him, they didn't. 
As the proud father of a retarded son, that was reassuring.
Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller anchor the film nicely, although Diaz's Mary 
is at times a tad too gullible, even for this sort of comedy. Matt Dillon 
is adequate, while Chris Elliott delivers a creepy variant on his 
standard overconfident goon persona. The film is nicely framed by 
legendary quirk-folk singer Jonathan Richman, singing a number of inanely 
catchy tunes as the film's wandering troubadour.
If anything in this review offended you, skip "There's Something About 
Mary." Otherwise, get ready for some big laughs from a deeply flawed, but 
very funny over-the-top piece of comic anarchy. Either way, you have been 
warned.

Ambitious, ingenious and visually breathtaking, "Pleasantville" is a 
rarity in contemporary filmmaking; a fully-realized vision that succeeds 
on multiple levels. Writer and director Gary Ross has crafted a wondrous 
experience that satisfies as a comedy, a fantasy, a drama and a parable. 
Movies don't get much better than this.
Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play disaffected '90s teenagers 
magically whisked into "Pleasantville," a black and white '50s TV sitcom 
reminiscent of "Father Knows Best." Like Connecticut Yankees in Robert 
Young's Court, their presence has drastic effects on this safe, sanitized 
community, where books are blank, toilets don't exist and even married 
couples sleep in separate beds. 
As the citizens of Pleasantville discover art, sex and the concept of 
nonconformity, bursts of color appear in their monochromatic world. In 
short order, color begins to spread like a virus through the town, and 
while many are enthralled by the changes, others are angered by what they 
perceive as a threat to their way of life. Soon, the patriarchal power 
structure organizes, determined to rid Pleasantville of the curse of 
color.
First-time director Gary Ross, who wrote "Big" and "Dave," handles this 
challenging material with a sure, steady hand. Easing into the story with 
reassuring comedy, he maintains a gentle tone even as the film graduates 
into drama, addressing serious issues without ever becoming ponderous. 
Legendary director Frank Capra would surely be delighted to see the proud 
tradition of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" 
carried on in a film of this caliber. 
"Pleasantville" is a deeply humane, spiritual film with an uplifting 
message that couldn't have come at a better time. These are dark days for 
our society. Recently, we've seen a man dragged behind a truck because of 
the color of his skin and a college student savagely beaten and left on a 
fence to die because of his sexual orientation. Conservative groups 
brandish the Bible like a weapon, using the mask of "family values" in a 
vain attempt to disguise their message of hate.
The more fearful citizens of Pleasantville exhibit the same behavior. As 
an increasing percentage of the populace changes from black and white to 
color, the result of embracing freedom and diversity to realize their 
potential, conservatives put signs in their windows reading "No Coloreds 
Allowed." When housewife Joan Allen embraces her sexuality and sees her 
pallid skin change to rich color, she panics. Fearing the wrath of her 
family and community, she tries to go "back in the closet" by covering 
her skin with monochrome makeup. Thankfully, she learns that once you've 
realized your God-given nature, it's wrong to live a lie. 
The symbolism and messages in "Pleasantville" aren't subtle: Ross chose 
not to work that way. "This movie is about the fact that personal 
repression gives rise to larger political oppression," he said in an 
interview. "That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or 
we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a 
lot of very ugly social situations can develop."
If this all sounds awfully heavy, rest assured that the film is far from 
a two hour exercise in tubthumbing. Ross imbues the film with a lilting, 
lyrical feel, many humorous and touching moments, and absolutely 
remarkable visuals. From the image of a single red rose set against a 
black and white background to the visage of a gray-scale youth gazing at 
a gloriously colored city park, "Pleasantville" is flat-out dazzling to 
behold.   
The cast is wonderful as well. Tobey Maguire anchors the film as a 
detached, ironic contemporary youth who initially tries to preserve the 
integrity of Pleasantville, only to learn that nostalgia is not all it's 
cracked up to be. Reese Witherspoon is strong as his sister, a young 
woman whose attempts to build a life out of fashion, sexual encounters 
and glib nihilism leave her yearning for self-esteem and genuine 
emotional contact. 
Playing the citizens of Pleasantville, J.T. Walsh (in his final 
performance) and William H. Macy are strong as men traumatized by the 
changes to their well-ordered lives, and Jeff Daniels stands out as a 
gentle soul with the spirit of an artist buried beneath his passive 
demeanor. Out of all the actors, Joan Allen is perhaps the most memorable 
in a deliciously nuanced turn as the archetypal homemaker who blossoms 
into passionate individuality. 
Beyond its stunning visuals and important messages, "Pleasantville" 
shines as a work of sheer joy, without a hint of the cynicism that 
plagues modern films and our world in general. Gary Ross clearly believes 
that humanity can grow past its fears to become a truly multi-colored 
society where diversity is embraced and individuality can flourish. As I 
watch the grim forces determined to impose their fascistic, black and 
white "family values" agenda onto our culture, I pray that he is right.

"Nico and Dani" is a little film, focusing on a few days in the lives of
two young male friends. The story turns on the fact that one of the boys
is gay and in love with his straight friend and includes some modestly
staged sex scenes between underage characters (the actors playing them
are adults). But this is not an American movie, so the sexual exchanges
and related issues are presented as matter-of-fact instead of
scandalous. "Nico and Dani" works because it stays low-key. The
filmmakers understand that, regardless of whether one's orientation is
homo or hetero, once boys gets sex on their minds, they will do
virtually anything to make it happen.
Adapted from the play "Krampack," the subtitled tale is set in a
picturesque oceanside village near Barcelona, Spain. When Mom and Dad
leave for a trip to Egypt, Dani (Fernando Ramallo) invites Nico (Jordi
Vilches) to stay with him. The boys plan to hunt, fish and just hang out
together, but that changes when they bump into two young ladies, Berta
(Esther Nubiola) and Elena (Marieta Orozco).
Nico immediately clicks with Elena and Berta is attracted to Dani, but
he only has eyes for Nico. While the boys have often traded hand jobs,
Nico views the sessions as simply a means for sexual relief while on the
road to traditional sex with a woman. After just a few meetings, Elena
makes it clear to Nico that she is willing to help him realize his goal.
For Dani, the bedroom exchanges with Nico are the real thing and he
wants to carry the relationship further. As Nico and Elena become
closer, he grows increasingly frustrated. When his attempt to ruin the
relationship by telling Elena that Nico is gay proves unsuccessful, Dani
heads for the home of Julian (Chisco Amado), an adult writer and
associate of his father. Even though Julian has a girlfriend, Dani
senses an attraction and makes overtures to the man.
Back at the home front, Nico is experiencing his own confusion. While
Elena consents to sex, she only wants a one-night stand and Nico desires
more than that. To make matters worse, Dani is missing and he fears for
the safety of his friend.
Nothing earthshaking happens in "Nico and Dani." No matter how the
sexual politics work out, it is obvious that the boys will remain
friends. And both of them are likable despite the fact that they commit
some reprehensible acts, including serving narcotic-spiked drinks to the
girls. Anyone who looks back at their own youth will surely remember the
lousy things they said or did while trying to get laid. "Nico and Dani"
is merely a slice of life, but it's a well-observed, wonderfully-acted
slice of life that reminded me that, while adolescence is a nice place
to visit, I wouldn't want to live there.

In politics, image is absolutely everything. Early in "Wag The Dog," 
someone challenges a top-level Presidential spin doctor about truth and 
he snaps "The truth? I'll tell you about truth. I saw the first draft of 
the Warren Commission Report. It said Kennedy was killed by a drunk 
driver."
"Wag The Dog" is a hilarious black comedy about people so far removed 
from morals that questions of right or wrong never even enter their minds.
 Their only consideration is the effectiveness of their elaborate 
deceptions, and who gets a cut of the merchandising profits. Cynical? Of 
course, but Barry Levinson's crackerjack direction maintains such a giddy 
momentum that there's really no time to reflect on how awful these people 
are. Instead, you just sit back and enjoy their brazen scheming.
Here's the set-up. 11 days before the election, the incumbent President, 
who has enjoyed a 17% lead in the polls, is accused of hitting on an 
underage girl during a White House tour. Within hours, his challenger 
(Craig T. Nelson) has crafted devastating new TV ads, set to the tune of 
"Thank Heavens For Little Girls." Quickly, Presidential assistant 
Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) calls in damage control expert Conrad Brean 
(Robert De Niro,) who reasons that the only way for the President to be 
re-elected is if they create a crisis big enough to divert the nation's 
attention from the scandal. Perhaps a war, maybe with Albania. "Why 
Albania?" asks Ames. "Why not," laughs Brean. To orchestrate the pretend 
war, he enlists the aid of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin 
Hoffman,) who is more than happy to help. "You know, there's not an 
Academy Award for producers," he moans, "Why is that? Do they think these 
things produce themselves?"
Motss quickly plots out the scenario for the crisis, then pulls together 
his experts to work on the really important stuff; the war's official 
slogan, theme song and merchandising tie-ins. When "that yellow ribbon 
business" is mentioned, Ames interrupts to explain that the yellow 
ribbons were a naturally occurring phenomenon. She stops short though, 
when she notices Brean smiling wearily at her naiveté.
And so the scam begins, with Brean instructing a White House Press 
Secretary to tell reporters that there is absolutely no truth to the 
rumors about problems in Albania relating to the B-3 bomber. When 
reminded that there is no B-3 bomber, Brean smiles confidently and says, 
"Exactly." The White House press corps dutifully responds to the bait, 
and within hours the nation is riveted to their TV sets, watching the 
latest on the crisis in Albania. 
David Mamet and Hilary Henkin's screenplay, based on the book by Larry 
Beinhart, is incredibly slick and fast-moving, operating on the 
assumption that movie-goers are savvy enough to roll with the concept. 
And, thanks to the surreal political realities of today, the absurdist 
story seems all too possible.
Barry Levinson is a uneven director, turning out a few great works ("Rain 
Man") and some real dogs ("Toys",) but he's in top form here. He shot 
"Wag The Dog" in just 29 days, and the film has an immediacy that keeps 
the proceedings buoyant. His camera work displays a breezy confidence and 
a great sense of play. It's obvious the director was having a wonderful 
time turning out this wicked little film.
Of course, it would be hard not to have fun with a cast like this. Anne 
Heche has a beguiling effervescence as the president's assistant. 
Winifred Ames may be new to deception at such a massive scale, but she 
hops right in and does her part. Robert De Niro exudes an ominous 
confidence as the man making the big decisions. His exact title is never 
divulged; you simply understand that when things go wrong, he's the guy 
you call to fix them. His role is much like Harvey Keitel's suave mob 
character in "Pulp Fiction," which makes perfect sense in this perverse 
context. Adding to the lunacy is Woody Harrelson in a deliciously twisted 
cameo as the designated hero for the bogus war.
But despite the fine performances of the rest of the cast, it's Dustin 
Hoffman who steals the show with his Oscar-worthy portrayal of producer 
Stanley Motss. Rich, spoiled and self-obsessed, Motss is a fascinating 
character. Mid-way through the film, when the opposition catches on and 
orchestrates a televised announcement that the war has ended, Motss 
explodes, shouting "Over?! This war isn't over until I say it's over!" To 
Hoffman's credit, you don't doubt him for a second.   
Skirting the line between preposterousness and uncomfortable plausibility,
 "Wag The Dog" is a nightmarish delight that invites comparisons to such 
great satires as "Network" and "Dr. Strangelove." Prepare to laugh 
yourself silly, and let's all pray that the film is less true than it 
seems to be.

Review for Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000)
Sometimes I wonder about writing movie reviews. There are movies that
really want me to ram-ble on and on, pontificating,
pseudo-intellectualising, and overanalysing it (which is when I really
want to do it). Then there are movies that are so bereft of any solid
content that I have nothing to say except empty words. /Loser/ happens
to fall among the latter category.
The film is a typical "underdog boy meets girl / boy loses girl / boy
gets girl" film. In this case, Paul (Jason Biggs) is the boy (a
"loser" from a small-town who isn't hip to the New York scene) and
Dora (Mena Suvari) is the (goth) girl in love with her Literature
professor.
Paul is the first in his family to go to college. He correctly worries
about fitting in. We watch him deal with the culture shock, his
use-and-abuse roommates, and his heartbreak.  The thing is, anyone who
acts like Paul in an academic institution today is far from being a
loser and is probably the kind of a person who is likely to go off and
form a startup and become wildly successful (at least by certain
measures of success, but ones I'm sure Paul's nasty roommates would
agree to).
Biggs and Suvari are decent actors, but this material doesn't
challenge them in any way. The chemistry between them is minimal. The
issues are unambiguously black and white (Paul is the perfect boy and
his roommates and the professor are perfect assholes), which is highly
unlikely in any real relationship scenario. The sound track is decent.
There's some commentary to be made about the use of the "date-rape"
drug Rohypnol, but director Amy Heckerling (of /Clueless/ fame)
doesn't make it. In the end, it becomes only a means by which Paul
gets revenge on his roommates.  The nature of the abusive relationship
between Dora and her professor is thought-provoking, especially from a
Freudian (lack of father figure) perspective, but the movie doesn't
explore that either.  /Loser/ is a rental for a romantic evening, but
only if the video store clerk can't "aide" you in finding something
better.

"Wonder Boys" represents a dandy twist on a relatively new genre, the
coming-of-middle-age story. Generally, films of this type (the
outstanding "American Beauty" is a fine example) focus on men beaten
into numbness or despair by the crushing weight of time, responsibility
and social conventions. When some unusual event jerks them into
awareness, they respond by rebelling against the norm, desperately
trying to recapture the vitality of youth. After colorfully acting out,
usually by aping behaviors straight out of "Animal House," they
eventually learn valuable life lessons that help them put their world in
a better perspective.
Things are different for English professor Grady Tripp (Michael
Douglas). In his cozy academic cocoon, he never had to grow up in the
first place. A celebrated author, Grady smokes dope almost constantly,
regularly bangs his boss' wife and enjoys reverential treatment from his
students and the college staff. Still, he is an unhappy man. As the
story begins, his wife has left him and his girlfriend, Chancellor Sara
Gaskell (Frances McDormand), has just announced she is pregnant with his
child.
Once the wonder boy of the literati, Grady has become crippled by the
success of his novel. The follow-up is long overdue and many secretly
believe he is suffering from writer's block. In fact, the exact opposite
is true. Privately, he cranks out a dizzying number of pages for his
latest, a massive tome that makes "War and Peace" look like a pamphlet
by comparison. Terrified that the book won't live up to its predecessor,
Grady continues writing as a way of avoiding completion, and
examination, of his work. Unfortunately, his editor is about to arrive
for Wordfest, the university's annual literary festival, and Grady knows
the heat is on.
But wait, that's just the beginning. Within a few hours, Grady will find
himself dealing with a gifted (and very freaky) student who may be a
pathological liar, the police, a furious gent with James Brown hair, a
stolen jacket once worn by Marilyn Monroe, and a dead dog. And you
thought your weekends were hectic.
Adapted by Steve Kloves from Michael Chabon's 1995 novel, "Wonder Boys"
is the first movie for director Curtis Hanson since his magnificent
"L.A. Confidential," and it shows the filmmaker in excellent form.
Gliding from humor to poignancy with the greatest of ease, Hanson has
crafted a smart, sophisticated feature that will delight mature
audiences. While the wacky elements are occasionally laid on a bit
thick, this is a movie to treasure. Adding to the enjoyment is the
timing of its release  how often do we get quality adult fare in the
middle of winter?
The casting for "Wonder Boys" is impeccable. After playing so many oily
rich creeps that the very mention of his name makes me shudder, Michael
Douglas gives possibly the best performance of his career as the
rumpled, aging man-child. Whether the scene calls for laughs or
heartache, Douglas' line delivery and affect is dead on, without a
moment that seems forced. Grady is a mess, but a lovable one, and
Douglas deserves great praise for his work.
As James Lee, Grady's most talented, and disturbed, student, Tobey
Maguire is perfect for the role. I've grown tired of Maguire taking jobs
where he is required to do little more than flash his odd kewpy-doll
smile and act inscrutable, but in this context, that's exactly what is
called for and Maguire plays off Douglas superbly. Still, I hope that
Maguire starts selecting parts that demand a wider range of expression.
Also, it would be nice if he spent some time outdoors, because there are
coma patients whose skin has more color than this kid.
The supporting actors are just as good. Robert Downey Jr. is delightful
as Grady's editor Terry Grabtree, mixing flamboyance and functionality
with grand style. Downey's ongoing drug problems have made him a
national punchline, and this film is yet another reminder that he is one
of the finest actors working today. Hopefully, Downey will conquer his
personal demons and get back on track soon.
As Chancellor Sara Gaskell, Frances McDormand is compelling, although
she doesn't get a lot of screen time. The same holds true for "Dawson's
Creek's" Katie Holmes, who still manages to make a big impression while
serving as a strong stabilizing presence in the midst of all the
madness. Richard Thomas and the dynamic Rip Torn also appear, but,
sadly, both are given scant time in the film.
In addition to its stellar cast and rich storyline, "Wonder Boys" also
boasts a hell of a soundtrack, including a memorable new Bob Dylan song.
Because this is a tale of humor mixed with substance rather than the
typical flashy Hollywood fare, it would be easy for "Wonder Boys" to be
overlooked by filmgoers. Don't make that mistake. Regardless of your
age, this coming-of-middle-age story has something for everyone. If you
want winter to consist of more substantial fare than formulaic crap like
"Reindeer Games," here's a chance to put your money where your mouth is.

Review for Shall We Dansu? (1996)
Shall We Dance (1996)
Koji Yakusho, Tamiyo Kusakari, Naoto Takenaka. Directed by Masayuki Suo. 
118 minutes.
Rated PG, Four stars (out of five stars)

Sly, observant and elegant, "Shall We Dance" is a charming story of 
liberation, the kind of exhilarating freedom one can only achieve by 
stepping out of the shadows and taking the risk of looking foolish in 
exchange for a chance at realizing a dream. Director and writer Masayuki 
Suo focuses on some odd corners of Japanese culture in this gentle comedy,
 but the messages contained in his subtitled tale are universal.
It all begins with the mid-life crisis of a reserved 42 year old 
businessman. Shohei Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) has attained his goals; a 
nice home, a healthy family and a successful career, but his life feels 
empty. He trudges dutifully through his days with eyes dulled by sadness. 
One evening, while taking the train home from work, he catches a glimpse 
of a young woman staring out the window of a dance studio. Her beauty, 
and the melancholy look on her face, capture his imagination. 
After several days of gazing at her during the ride home, he impulsively 
leaves the train and creeps up the stairs towards the dance studio. 
Dancing is viewed with suspicion in Japan, where public displays of 
affection between even a husband and wife are considered tasteless and 
shocking. The idea of two unmarried people holding their bodies close 
together in dance is "beyond embarrassing", the film's introduction 
explains. Regardless, Sugiyama summons his courage and signs up for dance 
lessons. Unable to afford individual instruction with the beautiful Mai 
(ballerina Tamiyo Kusakari), he joins a beginners class and his 
adventures in this unique little subculture begin.
The denizens of the studio are a peculiar bunch. Sugiyama's classmates 
are a extremely intense little man who has taken lessons before, and 
Tanaka, a tall, blobby fellow  whose utter lack of grace is matched only 
by the blissful, childlike smile on his face as he lumbers across the 
dance floor. The men are taught by Mrs. Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), a 
friendly middle-aged matron who notices Sugiyama's fixation with Mai and 
gently tells him "She's all the sweeter when viewed from afar". Mai gives 
solo lessons to her male clients with obvious distaste. Dance is 
everything to the young woman and the amorous intentions of the men draw 
an icy response. 
The most dynamic figure on the dance floor is the amazing Mr. Aoki (Naoto 
Takenaka). A co-worker of Sugiyama's, Aoki travels through the office in 
riotous fashion, moving forward stiffly, then pivoting abruptly, with his 
pelvis virtually leading his body. At the dance studio, Aoki dons an 
absurd long-haired wig and transforms into a frenzied master of Latin 
dance, wildly overstating every move as he leers with the expression of a 
warrior about to attack. Takenaka is hilarious and a delightful scene-
stealer.
Director Suo neatly uses comedy to punctuate the wistful story of 
Sugiyama's quest for satisfaction. His observational style is reminiscent 
of Scottish director Bill Forsyth's work in the wonderful "Local Hero". 
Like Forsyth, Suo frames his subjects in a neutral fashion, letting their 
actions speak for themselves. Watching the men's ungainly efforts to 
learn the art of dance is at once funny and touching. Both director's 
maintain a smooth narrative flow, but their primary focus is on vignettes.
 One of the best scenes in "Shall We Dance" shows Sugiyama practicing his 
steps in the rain by a train platform, as Mai watches from afar. It's a 
lyrical moment that typifies the elegant sentimentality of the film.
The reserved nature of Japanese relationships is also a key factor in the 
story. Sugiyama's wife is pleased to watch her husband blossom, but 
distressed because she doesn't know the cause of his change. Rather than 
simply ask him, she hires a private detective to investigate. Meanwhile, 
as Sugiyama becomes better acquainted with Mai, he looks at his own 
motives. What is it that drives him to stay near this distant young woman?
 And what of Mai herself? Mistrust and anger block her from really living.
 Can she break through her shell and embrace life again? 
"Shall We Dance" deals with a lot of weighty issues, but with a light 
touch. Suo respects his characters, foibles and all, and guides his story 
with an affectionate and ethical hand. The result is one of the most 
accessible, entertaining and heart-warming films to come along in a quite 
a while. It's hard to imagine anyone leaving the theater after "Shall We 
Dance" without a smile on their face. 

Title
Review for 101 Dalmatians (1996)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
The cartoon is way better. That's the bottom line on Disney's incredibly 
hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature. The alliance 
between Disney and slapstick king John Hughes has produced a frenetic 
"Home Alone" with puppies, and not much else.
When production of this remake was announced, the big question seemed to 
be "Why? The original cartoon still works, so what's the point?" The 
answer, it appears, is to give Disney an excuse for yet another massive 
merchandising campaign. 
The story, for those of you who missed childhood, is simple. Two 
Dalmatians, Pongo and Perdy, fall in love at first sight. They drag their 
"human pets" together, and in a short time both couples marry. The 
heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when Pongo and Perdy's new-born pups are 
stolen; their dog-napping engineered by the evil Cruella DeVil, who wants 
them for their pelts. Everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a 
frantic effort to save the puppies.
In the original movie, the animated pooches had a broad range of facial 
expressions and distinct personalities. We also could hear them talk, 
which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film, the 
dog's view of humans as their pets.
In the new version, the dogs are mute and expressionless. Hughes attempts 
to give them character with repeated shots of the Dalmatians draping 
their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks. While he 
drew the desired "Aww, they're so cute" reaction from the audience, it 
was quickly followed by several people whispering "I wonder what kind of 
food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that?"
The canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human 
beings had a little. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels are stunningly 
bland in their lead roles. In previous films, Daniels successfully played 
off his white bread persona. In "Something Wild", he revealed the 
rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor. In "Terms Of 
Endearment", his hapless appearance masked a cold, manipulative womanizer.
 Here, he and Richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder 
their images even stick to the film.
Glenn Close, however, has no problems establishing a distinct personality.
 As the villainous icon Cruella DeVil, she tears up the screen in a 
deliciously over-the-top performance. Close matches the intensity of the 
animated Cruella by becoming a cartoon herself. With a two-tone fright 
wig, red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips, garish animal 
skin outfits and stiletto heels, Close bursts through her scenes like a 
force of nature. She's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon, 
and her wicked glee is infectious. When she spits out lines like "you've 
won the battle, but I'm about to win the wardrobe!," the film comes 
briefly to life. 
"101 Dalmatians" is crammed with John Hughes' typical heavy-handed 
approach to comedy. After an ingenuous opening showing Pongo's morning 
routine as he gets Daniels prepared for the day, the film quickly tumbles 
into lame slapstick as the pooch drags Daniels on a careening trek 
through a city park. A little slapstick goes a long way, but Hughes just 
keeps laying it on. The second half of the film, where local animals team 
up to rescue 99 nondescript Dalmatian puppies from DeVil and her henchmen,
 is a tedious Home Alone clone, with the bad guys enduring a variety of 
sadistic assaults worthy of an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon, including a thug 
getting his testicles fried on an electric fence. 
"101 Dalmatians" has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from Glenn 
Close, but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick, bland 
characters, and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another.
 Rent the cartoon!

"Off to the movies we shall go,
Where we learn everything that we know,
'Cause the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say."
from "Mountain Song," written by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman
So begins the animated musical "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut," 
which starts off strong, sags quite a bit in the middle, but comes back 
for a rousing finale. The big-screen version of the popular TV series is 
staggeringly profane and very funny, although it may prove troublesome to 
those gentle souls offended by non-stop swearing, bathroom humor, 
sacrilegious remarks and jokes about "family values," small town 
Americana, Heaven, Hell, the movie ratings system, racism, abortion, 
menstruation, rednecks, gays, Christians, Jews, Canadians, doctors, 
homeless people, fat people, the military, the Presidency, Saddam Hussein,
 Bryan Adams, Anne Murray, Celine Dion, Alanis Morissette, Winona Ryder, 
Brooke Shields, the Baldwin Brothers, Bill Gates and Jar Jar Binks. Give 
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone credit, though: they treat Olympic 
skater Brian Boitano with the utmost of respect.
A word of warning to parents: Even if you allow your children to watch 
"South Park" on TV, do not let them see this movie without first 
screening it yourself. "Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is a comedy for adults 
that takes full advantage of its "R" rating. 
In fact, parents who fail to adequately monitor their children are key to 
the film's plot. After eight-year-old twerps Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, 
Kyle Broflovski and Eric Cartman take in a screening of "Asses of Fire," 
an R-rated movie starring their favorite TV stars, Canadian comics 
Terrance and Phillip, they emerge from the theater with a broader 
vocabulary, courtesy of their newly uncensored heroes. When the children 
of the sleepy little Colorado town of South Park begin swearing like 
longshoremen, their parents wildly overreact, leading to the United 
States declaring war on Canada. 
As happens weekly on the TV version of "South Park," Kenny dies horribly, 
only this time we follow him into the afterlife. Rejected from Heaven, 
Kenny plummets to Hell, where he overhears a conversation between Satan 
and his lover, Saddam Hussein. To save the world, Kenny must return to 
Earth and somehow prevent the pending execution of Terrance and Phillip.  
While the animation for the big screen "South Park" remains as 
delightfully crude as the original, co-writers Parker, Stone and Pam 
Brady use their new forum to create a lavish send-up of animated musicals.
 The 12 songs lampoon everything from Broadway style show stoppers to 
cheesy power ballads. Highlights include "Uncle Fucka," an obscenity-fest 
from Terrance and Phillip, "Blame Canada," a brassy offering from the 
parents, the peppy "Kyle's Mom's A Bitch" and "Up There," a terrifically 
hokey "inspirational" number from Satan himself, complete with the Dark 
Lord breaking into a falsetto during the overwrought climax, as a choir 
swells behind him. 
The songs, with lyrics by Parker and music by Marc Shaiman, are hilarious 
dead-on parodies, but for a film only 82 minutes long, a dozen tunes are 
a bit much (although I can't imagine cutting even one of these nasty 
little ditties). Surprisingly, Chef (Isaac Hayes), the one character who 
routinely croons on the TV series, doesn't sing a note here. 
After a powerhouse beginning, "Bigger, Longer and Uncut" suffers from a 
flaccid midsection. The boys organize "La Resistance," a children's 
crusade to rescue Terrance and Phillip, while Kenny counsels Satan about 
his codependent relationship with Saddam Hussein. Both storylines are 
sporadically amusing, but fail to sustain the riotous tone established 
earlier in the film. Thankfully, everything builds to an ending that 
almost recaptures the energy level of the opening. And, as an added treat,
 fans get to clearly see and hear little Kenny for the first time.
At once a scattershot satire and a feature-length dirty joke, "South 
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is a hoot, a spirited, invigorating 
exercise in tastelessness. Some fans will bemoan the musical format, 
while social observers will likely wail that the film is another example 
of how far our culture has fallen. To both groups, I can only quote the 
immortal words of Eric Cartman: "Screw you guys, I'm going home."

The barkers at old-time carnival freak shows lured customers in by 
promising they would witness spectacles like "The Incredible Two-Headed 
Dog" or "The World's Tiniest Man." After the suckers plucked their money 
down, they were led behind dingy curtains only to encounter a bored dwarf 
and a mummified puppy with a "second head" clumsily grafted on. "54" is 
the cinematic equivalent of one of those phony carny shows. After 
promising a festival of bare bodies, wild sex and debauchery set in the 
epicenter of late 70s - early 80s hedonism, they instead deliver a tepid 
morality tale that plays like a half-baked rip-off of "Saturday Night 
Fever."
It wasn't always this way. In an recent issue of "Interview," "54" star 
Ryan Phillippe described the film as an edgy work showing, among other 
things, a pivotal character free-basing onscreen. He spoke of kissing his 
buddy and co-star Breckin Meyer in one scene. Phillippe said "Who's going 
to deny that at Studio 54 in 1979 there were a lot of people going both 
ways, guys who'd make out with a boy upstairs and then head down to be 
with a girl? That was real; it happened. Why should I be afraid of 
evoking reality?"
Apparently all that evoked reality scared the bejesus out of the 
executives at Miramax, because the free-basing is gone, along with 
Phillippe and Meyer's kiss and virtually all of the gay and bi-sexual 
scenes (one anonymous male/male smooch remains, immediately followed by a 
reassuring glimpse of a hetero couple screwing with their clothes on). 
Hell, there's hardly even any straight sex scenes left in the film, for 
that matter. In their zeal to avoid making mainstream audiences feel 
squirmy, Miramax cut the hedonism out of a movie about hedonism. What in 
the world were these people thinking? Did they actually believe we wanted 
to see Studio 54 presented as a bowdlerized "Afterschool Special?"
So what's left? "Saturday Night Fever Jr." Phillippe plays Shane O'Shea, 
a lower-class Jersey kid who leaves his blue-collar neighborhood for the 
glitz, glitter and excess of Steve Rubell's Studio 54. After baring his 
torso for the smarmy Rubell, Phillippe gets hired as a busboy, making 
friends with barback Greg (Breckin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma 
Hayek), a coat-check girl with disco diva aspirations. Shane soon lands a 
coveted job as a 54 bartender, a position ensuring instant fame in 
Rubell's world of flesh and flash. The young buck sets his sights on soap-
opera actress Julie (Neve Campbell), even as his increasing drug use 
begins to numb his feeble little brain. Meanwhile, Rubell rolls in money 
(literally), taunts the IRS on television and swallows every pill in 
sight. You can figure out the rest of the story on your own.
Mike Myers gives a broad, but diverting performance as geeky dictator 
Rubell, playing him like a male version of his "it's like buttah" 
character from "Saturday Night Live." Rubell's notion of mixing 
celebrities and civilians in a glamorous exclusive neverland of 
debauchery was inspired, and watching this nebbish Napoleon rule his 
kingdom is fascinating, but Rubell serves only as a supporting player 
while the focus remains on the utterly vapid Shane O'Shea.
As Shane, Ryan Phillippe is very, very bland. One female admirer 
describes him as having "the body of Michelangelo's "David" attached to a 
Botticelli face." This woman clearly needs to get out to art museums more 
often. Phillippe is a slight, somber introvert and, try as he might, he 
is never believable as a stud here. Breckin Meyer displays far more 
charisma as the frustrated barback deemed too short to be a bartender 
(oddly, Meyer is only a bit shorter than Phillippe, who is not a tall man 
either). Salma Hayek is adequate as a would-be singer, while the 
cadaverous Neve Campbell barely makes any impression at all. 
Memo to Miramax. Having Ryan Phillippe describe the wild life at Studio 
54 in voice-overs doesn't cut the mustard. We want to see it. If you're 
going to finance a movie like this, give the final cut to the director 
and have the balls to stand behind him. Memo to everyone else. If you 
want to see an edgy film about sex, drugs and excess, rent "Boogie Nights.
" If you want a gritty, well-acted portrait of the disco era, rent 
"Saturday Night Fever." But whatever you do, don't waste your money on 
the superficial, cowardly "54."

Review for She's So Lovely (1997)
She's So Lovely (1997)
Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, John Travolta. Directed by Nick Cassavetes.
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/

Maureen and Eddie are crazy in love. They live in a run-down apartment in 
a seedy neighborhood. Maureen spends a great deal of her time looking for 
Eddie, who disappears a lot. Despite being pregnant, she smokes and 
drinks while wandering around complaining about her husband and seeking a 
little company. Eddie is an alcoholic, prone towards oddly poetic 
statements and bursts of irrational behavior. Maureen and Eddie are a 
mess, not the easiest people to be around, but one thing is for sure, 
they are crazy in love with each other.  
Their devotion is the core of "She's So Lovely", a gritty character study 
starring Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn and John Travolta. Actor and 
independent film director John Cassavetes wrote the script 20 years ago, 
intending to star in the film along with his wife, Gena Rowlands. Shortly 
before his death in 1989, Cassavetes rewrote the screenplay for Sean Penn,
 who initially planned only to direct the film. Eventually, Cassavetes' 
son Nick became director, with Mr. And Mrs. Penn playing the lead roles. 
The film is divided into two acts. In the first, a burly neighbor (James 
Gandolfini) invites Maureen (Wright Penn) out for some friendly drinking 
and dancing. When they return to their apartment building, it becomes 
clear that his intentions are more than friendly and he assaults the 
mother-to-be. She concocts a story to tell Eddie about her bruises, 
prompting him to slur "That's all I get; fables to cover foibles". 
Eventually, Eddie goes postal during a drunken binge and ends up 
institutionalized in a mental hospital. Maureen desperately assures him 
that he'll be better in "three months or so".  The second half of the 
film takes place ten years later, as Eddie is released from the hospital, 
unaware of how much time has passed. He learns that Maureen has remarried 
and has three children, two from new husband Joey (John Travolta). His 
head still fuzzy from years of medication, Eddie sets off to fetch his 
wife.
"She's So Lovely" was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival, garnering a Best 
Actor award for Penn. He deserves it. Penn's acting is nothing short of 
dazzling in this film. He invests great detail into Eddie, creating a 
damaged man who is both simple-minded and remarkably complex. There are 
hints of other characters in Eddie, everyone from Joe Pesci's explosive 
thug in "Goodfellas" to Dustin Hoffman's autistic savant from "Rainman", 
but Eddie remains a unique and compelling individual. When he tells a 
friend "You can't see my obscurity", the line feels real, the kind of 
statement one might make while groping through a fog of drunkenness and 
near-psychosis. Eddie is a lost man, tethered to this earth only by his 
unwavering love for his wife Maureen.
Robin Wright Penn throws herself totally into the role of Maureen. Her 
New York accent goes over the top periodically, but her character is 
credible nonetheless. With dark eyes and an uneven gait, Maureen is 
compulsive and abrasive. She takes care of her daily activities in a 
perfunctory manner, with her inner demons lurking just beneath the 
surface. Maureen isn't particularly likable, but she certainly is 
fascinating. The real-life chemistry between the Penns transfers onto the 
screen smoothly, their scenes together are electric.
John Travolta does fine work in his supporting role as Maureen's second 
husband. Realizing there would be no screen time to establish the back-
story for his character, Travolta makes every moment count. Bursting with 
nervous energy, his Joey is a devoted husband and father who dreads 
Eddie's arrival, knowing deep inside that while Maureen is his wife, 
Eddie is her one true love. 
"She's So Lovely" is an odd bird, a love story about people its hard to 
like. Maureen is self-destructive and very angry, Joey swears constantly 
in front of his young daughters, and Eddie is just plain nuts, but 
Cassavetes' script and the skilled cast locate the sweetness within these 
unpleasant people. Despite the horrible behavior of their parents, the 
three daughters are bright, well spoken young women. That seems 
incongruous initially, but in the end it really makes sense. Despite all 
the swearing and histrionics, Eddie, Maureen and Joey are essentially 
decent people, and decent people produce secure children. 
And despite all the grit and ugliness, "She's So Lovely" is a pure and 
simple love story. Thanks to the wonderful performances from Penn, Wright 
Penn and Travolta, it's a memorable one as well.

"crazy/beautiful" suffers from the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't
syndrome. After a spate of flighty, cookie-cutter teen films, the
romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its
love story. But rather than applaud the production, early reviews have
dismissed it as an overblown "Afterschool Special." Even worse, in the
wake of Federal Trade Commission hearings that blasted the industry for
marketing violent and sexual movies to young people, the studio got a
case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director John Stockwell to
re-shoot scenes and cut footage to "tone things down." Needless to say,
the filmmaker was frustrated. "We were trying to make a cautionary
tale," he told Newsweek, "and we couldn't show the behavior we were
trying to caution people away from."
Regardless, the film works, thanks to exceptional performances from its
lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes.
"crazy/beautiful" is quality fare, good enough that I half-expected the
Summer Movie Crap Police to walk into the press screening and confiscate
the print for "failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes."
Set in Pacific Palisades, Calif., the story follows the burgeoning
relationship between two teens. Every morning and evening, Carlos Nunez
(Jay Hernandez) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend Pacific
High School. An honor student and star athlete, Carlos is responsible,
modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the Naval Academy.
All is well until he meets Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst), the daughter
of a rich congressman (Bruce Davison). Nicole is a drunk apparently
hell-bent on self-destruction. Carlos is smart enough to recognize the
danger in getting involved with her, but he is only human and she has
the greatest smile. Plus, as her father notes, she has a real knack for
drawing others into her downward spiral.
As with "Save the Last Dance," "crazy/beautiful" (God, how I hate
lower-case titles) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes
them seem fresh. While noting the racial and social differences between
the kids, the screenplay dances around most of the clichés (there are
still several MTV moments, though). The filmmakers make a point to give
characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into
individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there.
Cute-as-a-button Dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath
Nicole's behavior. She is credible enough that when Dad urges Carlos to
get away from her before she drags him down, I hoped the boy would
listen. As Carlos, Hernandez is a revelation. Hunky without looking like
the product of a Hollywood design team, the young man can really act; we
will see a lot of this guy in the future.
Aside from its title, the biggest problem with "crazy/beautiful" is its
ending, which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy. After carefully
presenting credible characters and situations, the conclusion feels
rushed and lazy. Still, this is the kind of film that deserves accolades
from critics instead of cheap shots. "Afterschool Special" my ass 
"crazy/beautiful" is the real deal.

with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
In 1997, I spoke with "Down To You" star Freddie Prinze Jr. about his
sly, perfectly measured supporting performance in "The House of Yes,"
a delicious little black comedy about seduction, madness, incest and
the Kennedy assassination. The talented actor was exceedingly polite
and well spoken as he enthusiastically discussed acting
techniques. After interviewing too many preening, pretentious,
self-absorbed Hollywood heartthrobs, Prinze's down-to-earth, working
class nature was very refreshing.
The only thing wrong was his hair. Styled in a fashion popular with
young showbiz studs, his coal black hair was close-cropped on the
sides and back, with the top left thick, messed-up and heavily
moussed. The desired effect of the hairdo, I think, is to look as if
you had just crawled out of bed and, should the right person come
along, would be ready to crawl right back in again. Of course, the
mousse ruins any appearance of spontaneity and the 'do packs about as
much oomph as a lacquered explosion. On a guy as genuine as Prinze,
such a trendy, artificial hairstyle simply didn't fit.
Drivel like "Down To You" doesn't fit Prinze either. Aimed at
starry-eyed young girls, the cookie-cutter romantic comedy is trite,
tedious and even blander than its title. To try and jazz things up,
the filmmakers throw in wacky parents, colorful sidekicks, flashbacks
within flashbacks and unusual scene dissolves, but there's no
disguising the dullness of the main storyline. You can arrange Pop
Tarts artfully on a platter, dust them with powdered sugar and
artfully drizzle stings of chocolate and raspberry sauce over
everything, but, in the end, it's still just a plate of Pop Tarts.
Prinze isn't alone here in the squandering of talent. Julia Stiles,
the tempestuous lead in "10 Things I Hate About You," also adds some
flotsam to her resume. And poor Shawn Hatosy, so winning as the
central character in last year's "Outside Providence," is reduced to
playing a perpetually horny goofball. As for Zak Orth (the loudmouth
boorish student from "In and Out"), his role here as a loudmouth
boorish porn star with delusions of becoming Orson Welles may actually
be a step up.
Prinze (and, although they have made fewer poor decisions, Stiles and
Hatosy as well) would do well to use Matt Damon as a role model. Damon
could easily have traded on his All-American good looks, playing
terminally pleasant pretty boys in one film after another, but
instead, he has carefully selected roles that challenge his skills, as
well as the sensibilities of his fan base. While the lure of an easy
paycheck is undoubtedly tempting, Prinze has gone from nervy ("The
House of Yes") to tolerable ("I Know What You Did Last Summer" and
"She's All That") to for-the-love-of-God-what-were-you thinking ("Wing
Commander," "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" and, now, "Down To
You"). An "aw shucks" demeanor and crooked grin will only carry a
performer so far. If Prinze doesn't start taking some chances soon, he
is in danger of being hopelessly typecast as an innocuous male
ingenue. As he ages and his looks fade, where will that leave him?
Trying to snag a gig on a syndicated TV action series? Prinze deserves
better than that.
You'll notice I've said virtually nothing about the plot. That's
because there is virtually nothing to say. Boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, yadda yadda yadda. The lead characters frequently address the
camera directly; a stylistic gimmick that has been done to death over
the last couple of years. The bulk of the story is told in flashbacks,
further dashing any hint of immediacy. Henry Winkler and Lucie Arnaz
offer a bit of distraction as the quirky, loving parents: he's the
flashy host of a TV cooking show and she's a disc jockey who actually
likes what she plays. Although the movie is only 90 minutes long, it
feels like three hours. Thank goodness for the soundtrack, which
offers a nice selection of melodic ditties.
If you're a young lady who hasn't seen very many films, you may find
"Down To You" dreamy, occasionally naughty and wonderfully
romantic. If you're not, you probably were so bored by the trailers
that you never even considered seeing this movie. Good for
you. Watching talented young actors slowly committing career suicide
is not a pretty sight.

According to writer/director Edward Zwick, "The Siege" was intended as a 
cautionary tale that would show Americans that it can happen here; that 
given the right amount of fear and prejudice, coupled with blind trust in 
government, a police state could develop within our shores. The premise 
is certainly provocative and the film starts off strong, but sadly 
degenerates into a cartoonish open-air version of "Crimson Tide," with 
"Tide's" Denzel Washington going mano a mano with Bruce Willis instead of 
Gene Hackman. Even a bracing performance from Washington can't save a 
film that features a strutting action hero in a bad rug spouting tripe 
like "I AM the law!" The sluggish production is 116 minutes long, but 
feels like three hours.
When a group of Arab fanatics begin a series of strikes in the heart of 
New York City, FBI Terrorism Task Force chief Anthony Hubbard (Denzel 
Washington) is called into action. Following a false-alarm bomb threat 
and hostage situation, Washington encounters the real thing when 
terrorists blow up a Brooklyn bus, killing more than two dozen people 
(Washington, by the way, suffers only superficial injuries, despite his 
close proximity to the explosion).
As the investigation begins, Hubbard meets undercover National Security 
Agency operative Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), a Middle East specialist 
with excellent sources in the community. After the mandatory exchange of 
insults, the two band together to search for the men behind the nightmare.
The ringleader might be a sheik, whose abduction is shown in the film's 
opening scene. General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis) claims the 
government does not have the man in custody, but is he telling the truth? 
FBI sharpshooters kill three terrorist cell members hiding out in 
Brooklyn and believe the case is closed, but just as they celebrate their 
victory, a massive explosion at a Broadway theater kills dozens. The 
attacks escalate, building to a suicide assault on FBI headquarters that 
closely resembles the Oklahoma City massacre. 
The president declares martial law, and in short order the streets are 
filled with tanks, as Devereaux's troops scoop up any adult Arab males 
they can find and corral them in detention camps. Watching ordinary 
citizens hauled away because of their race and witnessing Devereaux's 
increasing paranoia, Hubbard and Kraft begin to wonder who the real enemy 
is.
With more care, the story could have worked. Washington, a gifted actor 
who has difficulty playing villains, but shines when playing heroes, is 
at his best here, and Bening is good, even though her character's motives 
are maddeningly unclear. She talks like an incredibly sharp, informed 
operative, but often behaves like an infatuated schoolgirl dilettante. 
There are no questions about the motives of General Devereaux, though. 
The character is straight from cookie-cutter central, and Bruce Willis 
adds no shading to the man, swaggering around barking terse, smug remarks 
as if he was hosting a Planet Hollywood opening. 
Before the release of the film, Arab and Muslim groups complained about 
negative stereotyping. Zwick's film is careful to establish the 
terrorists as a small, unrepresentative group, but, for the most part,  
the production fails to depict Arabs as real people. FBI agent Frank 
Hadddad (Tony Shalhoub), an American of Arab descent, is allowed a few 
moments of actual human depth, especially when his son is throw into the 
detention camp, but the bulk of the Arabs remain faceless victims, 
waiting helplessly to be rescued. 
As the film proceeds, its tone becomes increasingly cartoonish, building 
to a cornball climax with all the subtlety of a "Billy Jack" potboiler. 
What a drag. "The Siege" had potential. Had Zwick taken the time to 
develop well-drawn characters and a genuinely thoughtful script, he might 
have achieved his lofty ambitions, but in the end this grim exercise 
plays as just another stock action movie that leaves a bad taste in the 
mouth.

After watching "Simon Birch" for the first time, I raced to a bookstore 
and purchased a copy of John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany." I was 
anxious to read the novel for a couple of reasons. First, the 
relationship between the two young boys in the film was so utterly 
charming that I wanted to spend more time with them. Second, the credits 
stated that the movie was "suggested by," rather than "based on," 
Irving's novel, and I wanted to discover why. 
Prior to reading the book, I found "Simon Birch" a delightful, if overly 
manipulative, "Stand By Me" derivative. The story tells of best friends 
Joseph Wenteworth (Joseph Mazzelo) and Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith). 
Joe is a sweet, unassuming kid who wonders if his radiant mother Rebecca 
(Ashley Judd) will ever decide the time is right to reveal the identity 
of the father he has never known. Shunned by his parents, tiny Simon, the 
"smallest delivery ever recorded in the history of Gravestown Memorial 
Hospital," spends as much time with Joe and his mother as possible. 
Highly intelligent and extremely outspoken, Simon's faith is his dominant 
feature. God made him small as part of a divine plan and, regardless of 
what anyone says, Simon views himself as a miracle and awaits his heroic 
destiny.
"Simon Birch" is set in the same idyllic '60s small-town neverland as 
"Stand By Me." Both films use the same framing device, beginning and 
ending with an adult version of one of the characters reflecting on his 
childhood. In the closing seconds of each film, the adult's reminiscing 
ends when his own son demands attention in the here and now. Both films 
feature a central character who endures parents who treat him as if he 
doesn't exist. Both feature an eye-to-eye encounter with a deer in the 
still countryside. And both include a public event that goes riotously 
wrong, incorporating a barfing fat kid for comic effect.
If only "Simon Birch" had copied "Stand By Me's" score as well. As 
opposed to the wistful, understated orchestral music that accented "Stand 
By Me," Marc Shaiman's score in "Simon Birch" is cloying and overbearing. 
The bullying music is not only annoying, it is unnecessary. This is a 
story with enough oomph to stir emotional reactions without a 
manipulative orchestra nudging us through the film.
Despite its dictatorial score and "Stand By Me Jr." sense of cinematic 
deja vu, "Simon Birch" offers a number of pleasures. The portrait of 
resolute faith is stirring and the story of two best friends on a search, 
one for his father and the other for his destiny, is compelling. The 
central players are particularly well cast. Ashley Judd is luminous as 
Rebecca, a strong, devoted mother with a perpetually sunny disposition. 
Oliver Platt is warm and winning as Ben Goodrich, a beau of Rebecca's who 
acts as surrogate father to both boys. 
As Joe, "Jurassic Park" veteran Joseph Mazzelo gives a terrific 
performance, so strong that he can carry scenes even when his costar's 
inexperience shows. At 3'1," Ian Michael Smith is certainly the right 
size to play Simon Birch and, despite occasional lapses into stiffness, 
he does fine work for a first time actor. Together, the boys are magic, 
captivating as utterly devoted best friends.
Thanks to their winning performances, I found "Simon Birch" appealing and 
moving despite the oppressive score and Mark Steven Johnson's heavy-
handed script and direction. And then I read the book. 
John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany" is remarkable; a rich, complex 
work of art betrayed by Johnson's adaptation. After reading the book it's 
easy to understand why Irving asked the filmmakers to change the names 
and use the phrase "suggested by." Even while making allowances for the 
daunting task of trying to adapt a novel of this scope to fit the 
confines of a feature film, certain of Johnson's decisions are baffling 
at best and infuriating at worst.
Why did he make Simon's parents grim troglodytes who pretend he doesn't 
exist? They weren't that way in the book. Why did he have Joe act sullen 
and standoffish around Ben for much of the film, when in the book he took 
to him almost instantly? Why did he turn most of the secondary characters 
into cardboard cut-outs or leering caricatures? Why did he remove the 
political overtones of the story? Why did he take an opus that spanned 
many years and compress it into one, forcing the invention of a climatic 
scene that feels painfully contrived? And most of all, why did he take 
the Christmas pageant scene, a harrowing, pivotal moment in the book, and 
turn it into a ham-handed farce of barf jokes and horny adolescent 
groping, with Simon exhibiting behavior completely at odds with his 
character?
But enough of that. These are questions that will likely never be 
answered. Maybe they'll make a film of John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen 
Meany" someday. Until then, there's "Simon Birch," a nice little story of 
friendship and faith that manages to charm despite its myriad problems. A 
bit of advice. If you're one of the many fans of the novel, put it 
completely out of your mind before you go to the theater, or skip the 
film entirely and reread the book. And if you haven't read the novel, be 
sure to do so...but for Pete's sake, wait after you've seen the movie.

Beware, gentle readers, for there is a disease among us that is going 
unchecked. The disorder plaguing our society is called Sandra Bullock 
Syndrome. Victims of this nightmarish ailment spend great amounts of time 
whimpering while staring wistfully into the distance and periodically 
experience outbursts of uncontrollable lip synching and dancing to pop 
music oldies, generally in the company of others suffering from the same 
illness. Somebody please, organize a telethon now!
Sandra Bullock Syndrome, last seen in the film "Hope Floats," resurfaces 
in "Practical Magic," an occassionally entertaining, often silly and 
terribly disjointed romantic fantasy based on the book by Alice Hoffman. 
The story tells of sisters Sally and Gillian Owens (Sandra Bullock and 
Nicole Kidman), the latest in a long line of witches. Raised in a 
picturesque New England town by their giddy aunts, Jet and Frances 
(Dianne Weist and Stockard Channing), the girls learn of the family 
curse: anytime an Owens woman falls in love with a man, he dies.
After losing her husband to the curse, Sally adopts a quiet, withdrawn 
lifestyle, while Gillian moves from one Bohemian setting to another, 
having fleeting affairs along the way. When a boyfriend turns abusive, 
Gillian calls her sister for help and the woman unintentionally kill the 
man. Fearing legal reprisals, they decide the only logical thing to do is 
raise the creep from the dead. When Officer Gary Hallet's (Aidan Quinn) 
investigation brings him to the Owens' house, all hell breaks loose.
Parts of "Practical Magic" work. When Nicole Kidman looks at the corpse 
of her boyfriend and says, "Okay Jimmy, I will get you out of this, but 
then we are definitely breaking up," it's impossible not to smile. 
Towards the end of the film, a neighborhood phone tree is used in a 
unique fashion that is both ingenuous and entertaining. And, as 
outlandishly dressed old biddies, Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist have 
a certain loosey-goosey appeal.
But the production has no consistent tone, shifting awkwardly from one 
style to another. At times an occult "Thelma and Louise," the film also 
tries to be a spirited comedy, a horror film, a heartfelt romance and a 
story of empowerment. In more skilled hands the mixture might have jelled,
 but here it just feels disjointed. Even more annoying are the numerous 
MTV moments, where pop songs swell as the action turns into mini-music 
videos. And, of course, there's the scene where the women joyously line 
dance around the room, lip synching to the oldies. Oh, the agony of 
Sandra Bullock Syndrome.
Examining films like this on a logical basis is generally ill-advised, 
but I have to wonder why, if the Owens women have been reviled by the 
townspeople for centuries, they didn't just pack up and move. And 
speaking of the townspeople, it's maddening to watch their attitudes 
radically shift to meet the needs of the contrived script. At times they 
show open fear and hatred for the women, at other times they treat them 
as average fellow citizens, and later, they embrace the women's 
witchcraft without reservation. Why? Because one of the screenplay 
authors also wrote "Batman and Robin," that's why. 
"Practical Magic" has enough good moments to warrant a viewing on cable, 
or if you're on a long airplane flight, but otherwise, you'd be better 
served by watching virtually any episode of "Bewitched." At least there 
you wouldn't be subjected to the tragic results of Sandra Bullock 
Syndrome. Hopefully, medical science will eventually come up with a cure 
and talented female actors will never have to sulk, lip-sync or line 
dance ever again.

Hours after viewing the sweet reflective fantasy, "Meet Joe Black," my 
thoughts drifted to the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation," with 
which the film shares structural and thematic similarities. Like "ST:TNG,
" the production flips back and forth between its "A" and "B" storylines. 
If "Meet Joe Black" were an episode of "ST:TNG," the plot summary would 
read like this: Following an encounter with a mysterious alien, Captain 
Picard takes a hard look at his own mortality and begins to put his life 
affairs in order. Meanwhile, the android Data makes a concentrated effort 
to learn what it's really like to be human.
In many ways, "Meet Joe Black" plays like an exceptionally opulent, and 
extremely long, episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Both 
entertaining works star distinguished British actors and convey a 
positive message in imaginative fashion. Both feature an idealized 
extended family and unusually literate dialogue. And both productions, 
while charming, are sometimes overly formal and a bit full of themselves. 
Based very loosely on the stodgy chestnut, "Death Takes a Holiday," "Meet 
Joe Black" introduces William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), a media tycoon 
days away from his 65th birthday when he begins to hear a disembodied 
voice. Death (Brad Pitt) has come to collect Parrish, but the specter has 
a proposition. Having appropriated the body of a young stud muffin, Death 
wants to learn about the human experience and would like Parrish to be 
his guide. If the elderly man cooperates, his life will be extended; by 
days, maybe even weeks -- as long as it takes for Death to accomplish the 
goals of his field trip. Parrish agrees and introduces the omnipotent 
figure to the family as Joe Black ("If I say who you are," Parrish gently 
explains, "I don't think anyone will stay for dinner").
Joe becomes a constant in Parrish's life, to the consternation of his 
ambitious second-in-command, Drew (Jake Weber), and the confusion of 
Parrish's number one daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani). The young 
physician, romantically involved with Drew, had a brief, but memorable, 
encounter with the body Joe now inhabits, and finds herself drawn to this 
beautiful, otherworldly man.  
Like "Heaven Can Wait," another romantic fantasy dealing with life beyond 
death, "Meet Joe Black" features a business magnate making pronouncements 
that baffle his board of directors, while scheming underlings work 
against him. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as William Parrish, creating a 
rich, warm gentleman of great compassion and dignity. Joe tells him "I 
chose you [as his guide] for your verve, your excellence and your ability 
to instruct. You've led a first-rate life." Thanks to Hopkins' great 
skills, you never for a moment question the wisdom of Joe's decision.
The film's best moments are quiet ones as Parrish prepares to leave this 
world. There is a moving exchange between him and daughter Allison 
(Marcia Gay Harden), who has spent weeks arranging an incredibly lavish 
birthday party for her father. She softly tells him that she understands 
that Susan is his favorite, and that's all right, because she knows how 
much her father loves her as well. Harden is excellent, but watch Hopkins 
during the conversation. He conveys more through minute facial 
expressions than most actors could do with elaborate speeches.
Brad Pitt receives equal time, but his is the less satisfying of the two 
storylines. The learning-what-it's-like-to-be-human tale has been told 
many times before, by everyone from Jeff Bridges in "Starman" to Brent 
Spiner in "Star Trek." Like those actors, Pitt adopts stiff mannerisms to 
convey the sense of an alien being mimicking human behavior. His 
performance is sincere, if at times too mannered and precious. Thankfully,
 he gets better as the film proceeds and his character grows more 
comfortable with his form. 
Pitt is prettier than any of the women in the cast and his impossibly 
good looks are sometimes distracting. I found myself wondering how, if 
Joe needed help fixing his tie, he was able to keep his hair looking oh-
so-perfect. Apparently, mousse is much easier to manage than neckties. 
There are inconsistencies in his language skills as well. Early in the 
film, Joe doesn't understand a number of ordinary words and phrases, but 
seems nicely versed in contemporary slang. 
Claire Forlani is fine as Susan. Her mannerisms and wispy inflection 
remind me of a young Dianne Wiest. Marcia Gay Harden is even better as 
Allison and the always-reliable Jeffrey Tambor gives a good performance 
as Quince, Allison's well-intentioned, bumbling husband. As Drew, Jake 
Weber is appropriately prickly, although it's hard to fathom why Parrish 
wouldn't recognize his obvious bad intentions. And Lois Kelly-Miller is 
stirring playing a gravely-ill Jamaican woman who recognizes Joe Black 
for what he really is.
Clocking in at just under three hours, "Meet Joe Black" is a little too 
leisurely. The film would have benefited from some edits during the mid-
section of the story, which sags a bit. To its credit, the production 
recovers nicely, building to a romantic climax at the birthday party to 
end all birthday parties, with a lavish fireworks display providing the 
backdrop for the film's final scenes. 
"Meet Joe Black" is the kind of film that initially feels profound, but 
on later reflection has less substance than its sumptuous presentation 
indicates. Still, the story provides a lot of reasoned, thoughtful 
moments, with Anthony Hopkins delivering the lion's share of the rewards. 
It was nice to meet Joe Black, but much more satisfying to meet William 
Parrish.

"Pygmalion" meets "Saved By The Bell" in the featherweight comedy "She's 
All That," a formula teen flick redeemed by a scattering of inventive 
moments, coupled with the sheer charm of lead players Freddie Prinze Jr. 
and Rachael Leigh Cook. The pre-fab romance, while far from memorable, 
works when viewed as cinematic sherbet; a pleasant diversion to while 
away the time until something more substantial comes along. Put simply, 
if it were the offering on a long airplane flight, I'd pony up a few 
bucks for the headphones.
The plot is old enough to warrant carbon-dating. On a bet, a high school 
hunk sets out to turn an ugly duckling into the prom queen. From that 
sentence, you should be able to anticipate absolutely everything that 
happens in "She's All That." If not, perhaps a "Teletubbies" marathon 
would be more to your liking.
As with all makeover stories, you spot the swan-to-be immediately. She's 
the one whose dark-rimmed glasses, messy hair and rumpled clothing 
couldn't possibly disguise the fact that she is knock-out, drop-dead 
gorgeous. What a treat it would be if, just once, the "ugly duckling" was 
actually unattractive. Or, even better, if the young woman turned to her 
"benefactor" said "No thank you, I like myself just the way I am and have 
no desire to be done up in Cosmopolitan drag. I treasure my individuality 
and, if you require a perky teen queen, why don't you ask Jennifer Love 
Hewitt to the sock hop and leave me alone?"  
But enough dreaming. This is, after all, a corporate product, and the 
filmmakers slavishly adhere to the tried and true teen movie formula. The 
de rigueur soundtrack from flavor-of-the-day pop stars throbs incessantly 
in the background, while scenes are kept short and snappy, to avoid 
challenging those audience members suffering from attention-deficit 
disorder. The young cast is a veritable Whitman's Sampler from recent 
teen movies, with two actors from the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" 
films, two from the "Scream" movies, two from "Can't Hardly Wait," two 
from "The Faculty," both leads from "The Mighty," and one cast member 
each from "Varsity Blues" and "Halloween H20." If these kids decide to 
mate, inbreeding will be of paramount concern. 
As is the norm, the supporting characters are broad caricatures. Matthew 
Lillard ("Scream") gleefully chews scenery as a thinly-veiled variant of 
Puck, the social Neanderthal from "The Real World" who gained fame by 
being thrown out of the house by his roommates. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe 
("Halloween H20") hams it up as a "Melrose Place" style villainess, and 
Paul Walker ("Varsity Blues") sneers a lot as a jock with a heart of coal.
Of the adults, only two leave any impression. "Animal House's" Tim 
Matheson looks depressingly haggard as Prinze's father, while comic and 
character actor Kevin Pollack brightens the screen as Cook's papa, a 
chronically-preoccupied pool cleaner with an acerbic wit. 
With a film as fluffy as "She's All That," everything hinges on the 
appeal of the lead actors and, thankfully, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael 
Leigh Cook have plenty. Cook is a tiny thing, a sweet-faced youth who 
convincingly projects vulnerability and defensiveness, along with a 
welcome sense of underlying strength. Prinze, who gave a wonderfully 
subtle, complex performance in the delicious black comedy "The House of 
Yes," does solid work here, infusing his character with a nice blend of 
uncertainty and earnestness. Prinze is handsome in an unfinished way - - 
I suspect his face will age well. Hopefully, this film will offer both 
actors the showcase they need to snag more substantial roles in the 
future. 
In addition to Prinze and Cook's charisma, "She's All That" manages to 
sneak a few moments of originality into the formula. Early in the story, 
as Prinze's girlfriend explains why she is dumping him for Lillard, the 
film jumps to a flashback sequence on a beach, and as the scene 
progresses, Prinze strolls along the side of the action, offering pointed 
color commentary on the reminiscence. Later, Prinze visits a theater to 
witness Cook in a wickedly funny parody of performance art and, towards 
the end of the movie, an incongruous dance number livens things up. Bits 
like those, along with lead actors able to transcend their material, left 
me with a smile on my face. "She's All That" is a distinctly minor 
pleasure, but a pleasure nonetheless.

Review for Fight Club (1999)

At one point in "Fight Club," Edward Norton and Brad Pitt study a
designer underwear ad posted on the wall of a bus. After looking at
images of a lean, incredibly well defined male body, Norton asks "Is
that what a man looks like?" and the pair break into derisive
laughter. In another segment, Pitt lectures a group of men, stating
they were betrayed by a television culture that told each boy he was
destined to be a rich, celebrated rock star or movie star. The irony,
of course, is that Norton and Pitt are both rich, celebrated movie
stars with bodies that closely resemble those in the underwear ad. The
beauty of "Fight Club" is that its creators are completely aware of
the irony.
Dark, brutal and very funny, "Fight Club," the latest from David
Fincher ("Alien3," "Seven" and "The Game"), is one of the most
mesmerizing films to come along in quite a while. This ingenious
package combines dazzling visuals, a sizzling score, top-notch acting
and a truly audacious screenplay to whack the audience upside the
head, challenging us to sort out the dense conceptual package. At once
a psychological study, an apocalyptic horror show and a feature length
bloody giggle, "Fight Club" shouts "Fire!" in a crowded theater,
knowing that most of us will stay and study the flames instead of
running to safety.
The film begins, literally, inside the mind of its unnamed narrator
(Edward Norton), as the camera swoops through his brain, out of his
head and up the barrel of the gun in his mouth. Then we jump backwards
in time to learn what led to this moment. Frazzled by insomnia, the
narrator begs a doctor for medication to help him sleep. Instead, the
physician snaps at his patient, suggesting he visit a weekly
testicular cancer victims' group to "see what real suffering is like."
At the meeting, the narrator finds himself sobbing in the arms of
"fellow" sufferers, providing the catharsis he needs to sleep. He
quickly becomes a support group addict, attending different meetings
daily under a variety of assumed names.
All is well until he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter),
another poseur who travels the support group circuit because it's
"cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.'' The narrator cannot
cry with another "tourist" in the room and his insomnia soon returns.
Then, during a plane flight, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a
self-assured provocateur who works two part-time jobs when not
peddling his home-made soap to upscale stores. As a projectionist, he
splices single pornographic frames into family films. As a waiter, he
"seasons" foods with his bodily fluids. Tyler and the narrator bond
during a night of drinking, sealing their newfound friendship with a
just-for-the-hell-of-it fistfight. High off the violent release, they
decide to fight on a weekly basis. Other men witness the sparring and,
in short order, Fight Club is born, an underground phenomena that
spreads like wildfire.
Tyler becomes the central figure of the new men's movement, spouting
bumper sticker philosophy to his rapt audience of lost boys desperate
to remove the numbness from their ordered lives. Tyler begins
assigning homework ("Pick a fight with a stranger. Lose the fight")
and Fight Club escalates into Project Mayhem, something far more
frightening. The narrator is shaken by the changes. Why is Tyler
getting all the credit for something they both created? Why is Marla
sleeping with Tyler? And why didn't Tyler tell him about Project
Mayhem?
The extremely violent madness spins wildly, with kinetic camerawork
and the Dust Brothers' score creating a surreal atmosphere of
impending doom. The cast is outstanding, with the three principal
actors doing flawless work and Meat Loaf Aday contributing a solid
supporting turn. Jim Uhls' screenplay, based on the novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, contains so many ideas that it is impossible for Fincher to
address them all, so the director simply presents them for our
consideration. While sifting through the barrage, certain things
linger, from the early, almost subliminal single-frame flashes of
Tyler to the overwhelming homoerotic imagery in the bastions of
hyper-machismo. Of course, Tyler's psychobabble is merely a
rationalization for stylish violence (evoking memories of "A Clockwork
Orange"), but what does Fincher really think about the subject?
The moral conclusions are left up to us. In interviews, Fincher merely
stresses that the film is primarily a comedy. And it is: a grand,
horrific comedy that actually provokes discussion and reflection.
In light of a major revelation that comes late in the film, you'll
likely go see "Fight Club" again. I did, and the story is even more
fascinating the second time around. But as I left the theater, yet
another question popped into my head that will send me back to study
"Fight Club" a third time. SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING MAY REVEAL A
SIGNIFICANT PLOT POINT. After you learn the secret, ask yourself "Is
Marla Real?" Chew on that one for awhile.

Call it a horror version of a spaghetti western, with lots and lots of 
sauce. John Carpenter's "Vampires" is an incredibly bloody, gory machismo-
fest, with as much snarling, hateful, no-nonsense manly-man posturing as 
Carpenter can cram into 104 minutes. This is the kind of film that will 
prompt countless Internet postings with subject lines like "'Vampires' 
Kicks Ass!" and "Carpenter Rules!" And trust me, anyone who posts 
otherwise will quickly be deemed a "pussy" or a "queer" by those same 
zealots. 
Based on the novel "Vampire$" by John Steakly, the story focuses on a 
crack team of vampire killers, financed by the Catholic Church, roaming 
the American Southwest looking for head bloodsucker Valek (Thomas Ian 
Griffith), the fallen priest who started the whole undead thing centuries 
ago. Team leader Jack Crow (James Woods) is a coked-up version of the 
standard Carpenter anti-hero: imagine a gaunt Snake Plissken, only way 
more surly, whupping major vampire butt while spitting out vicious one-
liners (at one point he taunts a priest, saying "When I was kicking your 
ass, Father, did you get wood?"). 
Crow's second-in-command, Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), is another man's 
man. He explains the harsh realities of vampires to recently-bitten 
hooker, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), growling "It's not like they're a bunch of 
romantic Eurotrash fags dressed in formal wear." In the hours before a 
victim "turns," they have a telepathic link with the bloodsucker who 
nailed them, so Crow and Montoya coolly inform Katrina that they will use 
her as a vampire radar-detector, but the minute she turns, they'll kill 
her in a flash. In the meantime, they strap her face down on a bed, 
conveniently nude so Carpenter devotees can ogle Lee's shapely rear-end. 
While Montoya baby-sits Katrina, Crow threatens the Catholic powers-that-
be and tortures a priest for information.     
Am I painting a vivid enough picture? If not, here's a little more. The 
vampires are feral creatures, mean as hell and dressed like Marilyn 
Manson roadies. They're extremely violent: Valek slices one victim from 
crotch to head and we get to watch the body split in two, with guts 
spilling all over the place. They're not easy to kill either. Basically, 
you have to stake them, then drag their bodies into the sunlight where 
they burst into flames while screaming and flailing about.
As mentioned earlier, the whole thing plays like a souped-up spaghetti 
western and, for a while, it works. After years of enduring Anne Rice's 
effete Harlequin Romance vampires, it's fun to see the lace-cuffs ripped 
away from the genre. James Woods has a great time playing a bastard and 
it's entertaining watching him enjoy himself. There are some striking 
images: vampires striding confidently across the desert towards the 
camera, Valek lying on the ceiling waiting to strike. There's a great set 
piece at a motel, and the inevitable show-down, while awfully stupid, 
does have a strong sense of perverse style. And, for a while, it's 
amusing listening to dialogue so calculated to offend.
But eventually, the nihilism becomes tiresome, the gore and mayhem grows 
repetitive and you just want the damn thing to end. Carpenter did 
creepier gore in "The Thing." He did more effective fight scenes and B-
movie gags in "They Live" and better stoic macho theatrics in "Escape 
>From New York." "Vampires" is a minor guilty pleasure, but I'm tired of 
watching Carpenter rework his old tricks. It would be so terrific to see 
him try something new, like skipping feature-length pissing contests and 
creating films with actual characters and plots with some meat to them. 
So there you have it. Ed Johnson-Ott's "Review" of John Carpenter's 
"Vampires." Zealots can reach me at pbbp24a@prodigy.com. Feel free to put 
"pussy" or "queer" in the subject line so I'll know it's from you.

Let's get the basics out of the way. "Analyze This" is a very funny film. 
The raucous tale of a New York mob boss seeking therapy from a reluctant 
psychiatrist contains a number of mistakes (I'll carp about those in a 
minute), but still delivers big laughs on a consistent basis. Robert De 
Niro is wonderful, taking his classic gangster persona and giving it just 
enough of a twist to make the humor work. As for Billy Crystal, this film 
marks the first time in several years where I didn't have an overwhelming 
desire to climb into the screen and strangle him. For me, that's saying a 
lot.  
You see, Billy Crystal owes me, for stealing precious hours from my life 
with crap like "Forget Paris," "City Slickers 2," "Fathers' Day" and last 
year's wretched "My Giant," not to mention the numerous times he tortured 
me while hosting the Academy Awards, parroting a seemingly endless stream 
of tired Borscht-belt gags while smirking as if he'd just invented the 
fucking wheel (pardon the crudeness - - I'm simply trying to get you in 
right mood for the obscenity-laced movie). Thankfully, Crystal tones it 
down here. By the time, late in the story, where he finally does break 
into shtick, it's relatively easy to tolerate.
"Analyze This" brings together two wildly separate subcultures when 
mobster Paul Vitti (De Niro) enters the life of psychiatrist Ben Sobol 
(Crystal). Suffering from frequent panic attacks and crying jags, a real 
hindrance to an underworld kingpin, Vitti demands the full attention of 
Sobol, and if that means interrupting the therapist's wedding or sending 
a thug into the shrink's bedroom, so be it.
The production was directed and co-written by Harold Ramis (best known as 
the freakiest member of the "Ghostbusters"), a man with a real gift for 
crowd-pleasing comedies, including "Meatballs," "Caddyshack" and the 
bittersweet "Stuart Saves His Family." At his best, as in "Groundhog Day,
" Ramis can inject a nice message into a high-concept premise without 
diluting the comedy. At his worst ("Multiplicity"), he takes one joke and 
beats it to death.
"Analyze This" is one of his better efforts. Eschewing any messages or 
morals, Ramis simply goes for the laughs this time around and, for the 
most part, gets them. De Niro, parodying his many mob roles, plays a 
great steamroller of a man, trying to maintain his gangland machismo even 
while his emotions run rampant. De Niro takes risks with his performance. 
He doesn't just bawl, he blubbers, and his early crying jags come 
perilously close to overacting. But later, even while making the same 
ludicrous wailing noises, the great actor uses subtle changes in 
expression to effectively convey the genuine pain his character is 
feeling. A great deal of the humor comes from his awkward efforts to 
cooperate with the therapeutic process. In one scene, he acknowledges 
that he had considered rubbing out a key character, then helpfully adds 
"but I was feeling very conflicted about it." 
Had Ramis dug a little deeper, the comedy would have been more resonant. 
Even with suitable henchman (including a great turn from Joe Viterelli as 
Vitti's thick, lumbering sidekick), Ramis' portrayal of the mobsters is 
too superficial. Chazz Palminteri, playing Vitti's arch rival, is little 
more than a cardboard cut-out. 
The characters on Crystal's side don't fare much better. Lisa Kudrow, who 
gets better with each film, is given scant screen time (she makes every 
line count though, including one where she deliciously sneers "Oh great, 
my wedding is ruined because you have problems!"). Subplots involving her 
menacing father, as well as Crystal's dad, a neglectful pop psychology 
writer, are introduced but never revisited. And the genuinely sweet 
relationship between Crystal and his son deserves far more attention than 
it is given.
The film's biggest liability, though, is its timing. Just weeks ago, HBO 
introduced "The Sopranos," a brilliant new series about modern-day 
mobsters prominently featuring scenes between a crime-lord and his 
therapist. The show covers the same turf as "Analyze This," including the 
gallows humor, but with far greater depth, richness and elan. So my 
recommendation is as follows: enjoy "Analyze This" for what it is, then 
turn on "The Sopranos" and savor a great show exploring similar themes 
with far more success and, thank God, without Billy Crystal.

"Entrapment" boasts a top notch cast, an effective score, wonderful 
photography and a great deal of style. The caper film also has a plotline 
that stretches plausibility further and further until the final act, 
where it snaps entirely, leaving any link to reality fluttering in the 
breeze. Whether you exit the theater annoyed or amused will likely depend 
on your appreciation of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Me, I like 
the charismatic duo enough to forgive the film's major failings in the 
logic department.
Reminiscent of the glossy romantic thrillers from the '60s, "Entrapment" 
centers around a heist of monumental proportion, one that can only be 
carried out on December 31, 1999. The story begins in New York, when a 
thief with no apparent fear of heights steals a Rembrandt by using high 
tech equipment to enter an upper floor of a high-rise from the outside. 
After insurance investigator Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) convinces her boss, 
Hector Cruz (Will Patton) that legendary bandit Robert "Mac" MacDougal 
(Connery) is the man behind the crime, she sets off for London to find 
him.
Mac quickly turns the tables on the young woman, and the pair move to his 
castle in Scotland to sort matters out. Soon enough, they begin plotting 
the theft of an extremely rare Chinese mask from an English museum, but 
Gin has an even bigger job in mind. If Mac agrees, they will make a New 
Years Eve trip to Kuala Lumpur in the Far East, where they can take 
advantage of Y2K computer changeovers to funnel $8 billion from a bank 
headquarters in the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest buildings in the 
world. What finer way to celebrate the Millennium than by pulling off the 
biggest robbery in history?
But is it a set-up and, if so, who is setting up whom? Questions of 
allegiance are pivotal to the convoluted plot of "Entrapment," along with 
outlandish schemes, outrageous coincidences and loads of technobabble. By 
the time the film reaches its fractured conclusion, primary characters 
pull off stunts that could only be accomplished by wizardry. The story is 
utterly preposterous, but this is an old-fashioned "star vehicle" where 
plots are incidental. What matters in a film like this is attitude and 
sex appeal, which "Entrapment" has in spades. Exotic locations, potent 
music and jazzy cinematography combine to make an engaging package, 
although, of course, the main attraction is the pairing of two movie 
stars; one a veteran aging like fine wine and the other a delicious 
offering of a more recent vintage.  
Catherine Zeta-Jones made a big impact in last year's "The Mask of Zorro" 
and she continues to dazzle here. Her eyes, focused and assured, burn 
with a fierce intelligence that makes her other physical assets all the 
more captivating. She is a strikingly beautiful woman who seems quite 
comfortable strutting her stuff. The camera caresses her form, 
particularly in a training sequence where she glides her magnificent 
fanny ever so smoothly under a faux laser beam. The shot doesn't feel the 
least bit sexist because Zeta-Jones is totally in command of the 
situation. Instead of being turned into an object, she comes off as 
choreographer of her own erotic ballet.
And then there's Sean Connery, one of the coolest men who ever lived. At 
nearly 70, the years of been kind to this cinematic treasure. Each new 
wrinkle adds more character to that great face, while his demeanor 
remains as assured as ever, with an added gruff edge underscoring the 
sense of danger so crucial to his appeal. Working with this alluring 
woman 40 years his junior, Connery's character strives to maintain a 
professional distance, while both romantic and paternal feelings do 
battle with his judgment. The script hands him cheesy lines like "Never 
trust a naked woman," but Connery handles them with aplomb. 
Meanwhile, several other very good actors are given virtually nothing to 
do. Ving Rhames, one of the best talents in the business, makes do with a 
throwaway role that squanders his skills, Will Patton pops up to sputter 
occasionally, and Maury Chaykin spends his screen time plopped in the 
Buddha position, spewing threats in a fey voice while displaying his big 
belly and sagging breasts. Why? I have no idea.  
After three increasingly silly, but well-staged, action set pieces, the 
film builds to a climax at a train station where lead characters 
magically appear and disappear while law enforcement agents behave like 
Barney Fife after too many cups of hard cider. Somehow, the rampant 
stupidity in "Entrapment" actually enhances the film's goofball appeal. 
Add the charms of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones and you've got 
112 snappy minutes of big, dumb Hollywood fun.

When a whopping five films went into wide release on August 6, industry 
pundits were unsure which ones the public would embrace. "The Iron Giant" 
was the best reviewed film of the year, but, sadly, most adults still 
consider animated movies "kid's stuff" and children rarely get juiced up 
for a flick unless they see its name plastered on a Happy Meal. "The 
Thomas Crown Affair" was glossy, sexy fun, but with the huge success of 
"Runaway Bride," it seemed a little soon for another romance to hit big. 
The political farce "Dick" and the superhero spoof "Mystery Men" both 
appeared too quirky for mainstream audiences and, in the wake of "The 
Blair Witch Project" phenomenon, little attention was paid to "The Sixth 
Sense," the "other" horror film. 
Less than two weeks later, "The Sixth Sense" has become the first release 
since "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" to hold the number one spot at the 
box office for more than a week, raking in $70 million in just 10 days. 
For a quiet little ghost story starring an actor best known for smirking 
between explosions in action films, this is extraordinary. So what 
exactly is the deal with "The Sixth Sense?"
A few minutes into the press screening of the movie, I jotted the words 
"deliberately paced" in my notebook. Mid-way through, I crossed out 
"deliberate" and replaced it with "dull." But after the striking 
conclusion of the story, I spent a long time in the lobby with a fellow 
critic, enthusiastically discussing the film. The following Saturday, at 
a nationwide sneak preview, we both went to see it again. 
In its own way, "The Sixth Sense" is as innovative as "The Blair Witch 
Project." Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan carefully establishes a 
moody, extremely low-key tone, only to smack you upside the head when you 
least expect it. You feel compelled to watch the movie another time, to 
see how it holds up in light of the things you learned along the way. 
This is one of those rare productions that actually plays better the 
second time around.
It begins when a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks into the 
Philadelphia home of child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) 
and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). The frantic young man accuses the 
doctor of failing him, then abruptly shoots Malcolm, just before turning 
the gun on himself.
Cut to the following autumn. Malcolm and Anna's marriage has taken a 
drastic turn since the tragedy. Both are sullen and non-communicative, 
with Anna focusing most of her attention on her work at an antique shop 
and Malcolm focusing most of his on a new case. Eight-year-old Cole Sear 
(Haley Joel Osment) is an extremely troubled boy. His single mother Lynn 
(Toni Collette) is at a loss to understand the behavior of her son, a 
bright kid who hoards religious figurines, creates alarming drawings and 
constantly surveys his surroundings in fear. The doctor works cautiously 
with the wary child, hoping trying to establish a bond of trust. After 
many meetings, Cole finally turns to Malcolm and reveals his secret. "I 
see dead people," he whispers, desperately looking to the doctor for help.
That's all you need to know. If, like me, you find the proceedings overly 
slow and ponderous, hang in there, because your patience will be rewarded 
with a whale of a payoff. "The Sixth Sense" is one of the better ghost 
stories to come along in quite some time, for those willing to cooperate 
with Shyamalan's methodical presentation. 
The director uses the Philadelphia settings well, creating a stately, 
ominous feel accented by James Newton Howard's creepy, but unobtrusive 
score. Shyamalan ends many scenes by fading to black, a stylistic move 
that seems like a slightly overdone affectation at first, but in fact 
proves essential to the story. His visualizations of the dead are less 
successful. The natural lighting is too matter-of-fact for the ghosts to 
appear authentic; instead of seeming otherworldly, they just look like 
actors in makeup.
His key players compensate for the unconvincing spooks. While 
"Rushmore's" Olivia Williams is given little to do and Toni Collette only 
gets a couple of scenes to display her formidable talents, Bruce Willis 
offers an appropriately restrained performance and Haley Joel Osment is 
exceptional. The young actor does fine work, nimbly projecting 
intelligence, fear and desperation without ever overdoing it.  
Congratulations to those who have made "The Sixth Sense" a box office 
smash. You have shown that mass audiences sometimes do choose a small, 
well-told story over standard, mega-hyped summer dreck. Now, while you're 
making such good decisions, how about giving "The Iron Giant" a chance as 
well?

The tagline for "Enemy of the State" is "It's not paranoia if they're 
really after you." Leaving the theater following the popcorn thriller 
about an innocent man caught in a web of secret agents, surveillance 
equipment and deadly covert activities, I wondered how the movie might 
affect any genuine paranoids in the audience. Just imagine some poor guy, 
feverishly twitching in his seat, thinking "I knew it, they're really out 
there! If fact, they probably create movies just like this to convince us 
that these kind of activities are too fantastic to be true, thereby 
lulling us into a false sense of security." 
For anyone concerned that the elaborate high-level intrigue portrayed in 
"Enemy of the State" reflects reality, let's look at a recent example of 
governmental effectiveness. It took conservatives several years and 
millions of dollars just to prove that President Clinton "got some" on 
the side, and, months after the revelation, he's still in office and the 
Republicans got clobbered in the elections. That, ladies and gentlemen, 
is how our government works.
In "Enemy of the State," Will Smith plays attorney and family man Robert 
Clayton Dean. Life is good for the Washington DC lawyer, until he bumps 
into Zavitz (Jason Lee), an old college buddy. After their brief 
encounter, Zavitz is chased by government operatives, only to be struck 
down and killed on a nearby highway. Dean, shaken by the death of his 
friend, returns home, unaware that Zavitz slipped him a disc documenting 
the assassination of a Congressman by the same group of goons. In short 
order, agents knock on Dean's door and the young professional ends up on 
the run; with his credit and job destroyed, his marriage in a shambles 
and lots of scary guys trying to kill him.
With "Independence Day" and "Men in Black" on his résumé, and "The Wild 
Wild West" due next summer, Will Smith clearly knows how to pick crowd-
pleasing movies and "Enemy of the State" should provide him another hit. 
The film, from "Armageddon" producer Jerry Bruckheimer and "True Romance" 
director Tony Scott, is fast-paced and packed with action and thrills. 
As always, Smith is a likable and convincing all-American hero who 
manages to deliver good one-liners between chases and feats of derring-do.
 Smith works best when paired with older actors, and he has a great one 
here, with Gene Hackman giving a crisp performance as a former operative 
of the National Security Agency. The two actors work very well together.
As a matter of fact, "Enemy of the State" is notable for having a far 
more talented cast than your average action/thriller. Jon Voight gives 
his most focused performance in quite some time as a corrupt State 
Department official. The seasoned veteran is surrounded by a very 
impressive group of bright young actors playing assorted smooth-talking 
snakes, techno-geeks and government thugs. Stand outs include Jack Black 
("Mars Attacks!"), Loren Dean ("Gattica"), Barry Pepper ("Saving Private 
Ryan"), Jamie Kennedy ("Scream 2"), Ian Hart ("The Butcher Boy"), and 
Jake Busey ("Home Fries"). 
As if that wasn't enough, Gabriel Byrne pops up, along with "Chasing 
Amy's" Jason Lee, James Le Gros from "Drugstore Cowboy," "Frasier's" Dan 
Butler and Jason Robards, in an uncredited performance as a Congressman 
with fatal integrity. Add "Angel Heart's" Lisa Bonet and Regina King from 
"How Stella Got Her Groove Back" and you're talking about one hell of a 
powerhouse cast.
Bruckheimer and Scott were wise to load their film with so many talents, 
because it takes actors this good to obscure the many implausibility's of 
the film. Beneath the non-stop barrage of high-tech surveillance and 
action scenes, "Enemy of the State" contains a coincidence-filled 
storyline held together by duct tape. In addition, a couple of the chases 
go on too long and the ending, while satisfying, is way too pat to be 
believed.
But, of course, we're not supposed to believe any of this. After all, 
"Enemy of the State" is just a silly, entertaining, over-the-top paranoid 
thriller and none of it could ever happen in real life. Or maybe that's 
just what they want us to think...

WARNING: This review contains obscenities and racist slang.
An early segment in the prison comedy "Life" shows Eddie Murphy's 
character entertaining his fellow inmates by spinning tales about the 
nightclub he dreams of opening. Huddled in their darkened barracks, the 
men sit enraptured as Murphy describes a grand, "Cotton Club" style 
setting and incorporates them into his fantasy. The camera moves from man 
to man, cutting from close-ups of the prisoners' faces to images of them, 
dressed to the nines, strutting their stuff in the neverland nightspot. 
It's a funny, sweet, wistful scene that shows the kind of movie "Life" 
could have been.
Instead, the bulk of the movie consists of scintillating dialogue along 
the lines of "Nigger, what the fuck are you talking about? Shit, 
motherfucker, you don't know a god-damned motherfucking thing, so fuck 
you, motherfucker!" "Oh yeah, well I never liked you either, so fuck you 
too, nigger!" Multiply the "shits," "niggers" and variants of the word 
"fuck" in the preceding sentences by about 200 and you'll have your very 
own copy of the script for this cinematic jewel. If you found this 
paragraph offensive; congratulations, you're a grown-up. If, however, you 
found the dialogue hilarious, then turn off "The Jerry Springer Show," 
find someone with a valid driver's license and haul it down to the 
picture show for some big fun, Cletus.  
Told in flashbacks, "Life" covers 65 years in the lives of two men 
wrongfully convicted of murder, following them from 1932 Harlem to the 
Mississippi prison where they spend the bulk of their lives. Over the 
course of 108 sluggish minutes, we're treated to a few honest laughs, a 
few genuinely heartfelt moments, some terrific make-up, and loads of 
cussing and insult humor. Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence are talented 
enough to make some of this tripe work, but for the most part, "Life" is 
formulaic, obvious and very slow. In fact, the outtakes shown over the 
closing credits are funnier than anything in the movie, particularly the 
final one, which contains a terrific ad-lib from Murphy. 
To be fair, I should note that most of the audience at the sneak preview 
I attended howled through the entire movie and a few people even 
applauded. Perhaps they caught something that I missed. As someone who 
finds insult humor lazy and annoying, I may have simply missed the subtle 
nuances of the script. Or perhaps this same audience would also be 
entertained by staring at shiny rocks. You make the call. 
Had "Life" bothered to flesh out its characters, the shrieking between 
Murphy and Lawrence might have been easier to take, but at the end of the 
film, little has changed. Both men remain rough sketches, older and a bit 
softer, but still terribly underdeveloped. Had the tragedy of lives 
wasted by impulsive behavior and a racist legal system been better 
explored, the humor might have packed some punch. Periodically, the 
filmmakers add segments that truly are touching. The reaction of a 
convict to the death of his lover is presented starkly and with dignity 
(one audience member responded to the scene by loudly saying "Fag"). The 
passage of time is depicted eloquently with images of various inmates 
slowing fading out of the picture. 
Understand, I'm not complaining because the film isn't a drama. But with 
performers as gifted as Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, and a decades-
spanning tale of the residents of an all-black prison in the deep South, 
"Life" had the potential to be both funny and substantial. As is, only 
one day after seeing the film, all I remember is a few good moments, some 
great outtakes, and a whole lot of obscenity-laced hollering.

There have been a few sequels that were as good as, or better than, the 
originals. "Godfather 2", "Terminator 2: Judgement Day", "Aliens", and 
the even numbered "Star Trek" films come to mind. "Speed 2: Cruise 
Control" doesn't. Listening to the audience as they left an advance 
screening of the film, the most frequent comment heard was "that was cute.
" Be honest, are you really interested in a big action-packed summer 
thrill-ride film that can be summed up as "cute?" 
While it's doubtful that the original "Speed" will ever go down as a 
cinematic landmark, the film was both a fine showcase for Sandra 
Bullock's charm and an efficient little thriller. A big part of "Speed's" 
success came from the simplicity of the storyline. If the bus drops below 
50 mph, it will blow up, so we have to keep going 50, but we're running 
out of road. A simple conceit that confined the action to a set space and 
focused on the people involved in the situation. During the quiet moments 
of the ride, we were able to enjoy the chemistry between Bullock and 
Keanu Reeves.  
"Speed 2" lacks both the chemistry and efficiency of the original. 
Desperate to establish action-movie momentum quickly, director Jan De 
Bont ("Speed", "Twister") keeps the cameras jiggling from the second the 
film begins. Even during the subdued moments, the camera whooshes around 
as if the Tasmanian Devil was filming the story. The movie starts with a 
comic scene of Bullock taking a driving lesson from instructor Tim Conway.
 She jerks the vehicle through traffic as if she was in a high-speed 
chase, while Conway whimpers and cringes. The bit works on a primitive 
sit-com level, but undermines Bullock's character, making her look like 
some half-witted loon. 
She soon hooks up with her new boyfriend, an L.A.P.D. SWAT team member, 
who invites her to take a cruise with him. The two leave L.A. for a 
relaxing Caribbean cruise on the Seabourn Legend.
As the handsome young couple gets acclimated to the ship, you wait to see 
the sparks ignite between them, but it doesn't happen. Jason Patric, who 
played the older brother in "The Lost Boys", is a fine actor renown for 
his intensity. It's in full flower here, as he searches with deadly 
earnestness for the right moment to propose marriage to Bullock. The 
moment doesn't come, as Bullock, determined to take things slow, plays 
her scenes in an odd, distracted fashion. During their romantic 
interludes, she looks as if something really interesting is happened just 
on the other side of the camera. There is absolutely no chemistry between 
the pair.
Of course, all hell breaks loose in short order, as Willem Dafoe, a 
disgruntled ex-employee of the cruise line, takes control of the ship's 
computers. He fakes a series of fires to force evacuation of the ship, 
then standard-issue action movie mayhem ensues. Dafoe is another of 
"Speed 2's" problems. Films like this work best with a memorable villain 
and Dafoe is eminently forgettable. He tries; giggling, twitching, and 
wrenching his eyes into a Charles Manson psychotic gleam, but overall the 
effect is silly, not menacing. "Speed 2" should have borrowed a villain 
from the "Con Air" prison transport plane  they had enough bad guys to 
float a loaner.
As the shipboard action erupts, so do several annoying movie clichés. 
First off, the entire crew of the ship has no idea what to do in an 
emergency. Thank God they had two plucky tourists to take command of the 
situation! Second, the curse of the talking villain strikes as Dafoe 
skips at least a half dozen opportunities to shoot our heroes, choosing 
instead to talk to them at great length, explaining his motivations and 
evil intentions, while giving them time to regroup. Finally, the helpless 
victim syndrome hits as Bullock is taken hostage by Dafoe and doesn't 
escape. Oh sure, she howls, threatens and swings at him periodically, but 
she stays by his side, skipping painfully obvious chances to get away.
"Speed 2" isn't all bad. A number of the action scenes are effective, and 
the film's nods to other movies and TV shows, particularly "The Love 
Boat" and "The Poseidon Adventure" are amusing ("Twister" fans should 
watch the skies for a brief bovine appearance during an explosion. ) 
That's about all the fun there is, though. The producers of "Speed 2" 
should savor their opening weekend receipts, because as soon as word of 
mouth (and this Friday's release of "Batman And Robin") gets around, this 
seaboard mish-mash of missed opportunities should sink like a stone.

Jeffrey Wigand is a hero. The former corporate officer of a major
tobacco company risked everything to blow the whistle on his employers
and "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman eagerly taped his
statement. But greed and fear at the highest levels of the network led
CBS to pull the finished segment. Stunned at the breach of
journalistic integrity, Bergman frantically tried to save the
interview while his number one source was left twisting in the wind.
This powerful slice of recent history deserves the big screen
treatment. To a degree, "The Insider" does its subject proud. But at a
whopping two hours and 38 minutes, the deliberately paced film from
director Michael Mann ("Last of the Mohicans," "Heat") is about 40
minutes too long. As if that wasn't challenging enough, a shift in
focus from Wigand to Bergman during the last hour further undermines
the impact of the piece. In real life, Wigand found himself swallowed
by network politics and a smear campaign by the tobacco
company. Sadly, his character ends up a ghost in the film as well.
Still, patient viewers will find substantial rewards here. After
breaking onto the American scene with "L.A. Confidential," Russell
Crowe gives another stellar performance as Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist
who learned that cigarettes were merely "a delivery device for
nicotine" and that the tobacco companies routinely manipulated the
drug to further promote addiction. Crowe deftly creates a rich,
three-dimensional portrait of this deeply conflicted man. For
authenticity, the actor also gained 50 pounds for the role and proudly
displays the results in a brief "Check out my flab - - am I dedicated
or what?!" shirtless scene, one of the more amusing contemporary movie
clichés.
Thankfully, serial overactor Al Pacino reigns in his scenery chomping
for most of the film, although he finally tears loose towards the end
of the story. As Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer does a reasonable,
if oily, impersonation of the veteran newsman.
"The Insider" is similar in theme and structure to "Prince of the
City," although the latter is a far superior film. While even longer
than "The Insider," "Prince" had a much more intricate story to
tell. In addition, the filmmakers recognized the importance of keeping
their tortured informant in the center of the proceedings. When "The
Insider" veers from Wigand to Bergman, the film becomes just another
tale of a crusading journalist, and, though the mechanics are
fascinating, it remains a trip through overly familiar
territory. While the tobacco company failed in their attempt to bury
Jeffrey Wigand, "The Insider" finally dismisses him, leaving the man a
footnote at the end of his own valiant story.

When Academy Award winning writer ("The Usual Suspects") and first-time
director Christopher McQuarrie sat down to block out "a kidnapping saga
as a contemporary western awash in film noir overtones," he had an
agenda. It seems McQuarrie was unhappy with the way mainstream Hollywood
screenplays handle characters when they behave badly.
"The thing that has continually bothered me about films today is this
skewed sense of justice, this false sense of accountability," stated
McQuarrie. "In reality, people die all the time and the score isn't
evened, their death isn't justified. What's frustrating with Hollywood's
approach is that you see someone do a bad deed and they're punished for
it 10 times over. Not only is that not reality, but you're telling
people that their judgment about anything is okay."
Thanks a heap, Chris. After watching and reading countless news stories
about human beings doing unspeakably horrible things to other human
beings and getting away with their deeds, what a comfort it is to know
that you are out there, striving to insure that movies are just as
repulsive as real life.
"The Way of the Gun" follows two creeps as they kidnap a surrogate
mother-to-be, only to learn that the target of their ransom demands is a
money-laundering, union-busting bagman with a slew of thugs in his
employ. The story takes place in some alternate universe, where innocent
bystanders stare numbly at gunfights until they are instructed to flee,
where men race about shooting at each other with little visible concern
over the flying bullets and where no one ever calls the police.
Oh yes, Christopher McQuarrie has this hard-edged reality business down
pat.
In his alternate universe, women merely seethe or shriek, while the
men-folk pontificate endlessly, lobbing around quotes like:

Early in "Arlington Road," terrorism expert Michael Faraday (Jeff 
Bridges) shows his college class a series of horrific images 
reminiscent of the Oklahoma City massacre, then discusses the 
public's willingness to accept the notion that one man could be 
responsible for such atrocities. "We don't want others," he explains. 
"We want one name and we want it fast, because it gives us our 
security back." That's a genuinely disturbing idea and a great way to 
start a movie. "Arlington Road" also boasts a corker of a closing 
scene that is both shocking and thought provoking. If only the parts 
in-between were as good.  
Writer Ehren Kruger's script is the main offender, lobbing an absurd 
number of coincidences at the audience. While most thrillers demand a 
certain suspension of disbelief, Kruger asks viewers to completely 
disengage anything even faintly related to logic. His contrived plot 
stretches credulity further than those amorphous thrillers that pay-
cable channels run in the wee hours of the night. Director Mark 
Pellington doesn't help matters much. Determined to create a 
nightmare-in-suburbia feel, he throws in so much gimmicky lighting 
and skewed camera angles that major portions of the film play like a 
parody of "The Twilight Zone." 
Remember "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," the "there's a monster on the 
wing of our airplane!" horror tale featured in both the TV and movie 
versions of "The Twilight Zone?" In their respective takes on the 
lead role, William Shatner and John Lithgow stammered, twitched, 
jerked and shrieked in deliciously over-the-top performances that 
nicely complimented the outrageous story. Unfortunately, Pellington 
directs Jeff Bridges in the same way here, with embarrassing results. 
Bridges, normally an outstanding actor, must escalate from grieving 
husband to hysterical loon under Pellington's leering camera. 
Bridges' performance is not a pretty sight.  
Set in a upscale suburb in Northern Virginia, the film centers around 
Professor Faraday, who tries to carry on a normal life with his young 
son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) and girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), 
while still grieving the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed during 
a botched raid. After rescuing an injured neighbor boy (Mason Gamble),
 Faraday becomes friends with the boy's parents, Oliver and Cheryl 
Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack). On the surface, the Langs seem 
like a typical all-American family, but Faraday begins noticing 
peculiarities in their wholesome appearance. Suspecting they may be 
part of some extremist group, he begins examining Oliver's background,
 seeking help from Brooke, as well his wife's former partner, Whit 
Carver (Robert Gossett). They both have strong misgivings about his 
mission and counsel Faraday to drop the investigation. After all, 
what are the chances that a terrorism expert, who lost his wife in a 
terrorism-related raid, would end up with terrorists living across 
the street from him? 
Good question. While the film flirts with the notion that Faraday may 
simply be paranoid, it's obvious where things are going, thanks to 
Pellington's ham-handed direction. Oliver and Cheryl Lang peer 
ominously from windows and half-opened doors. They make cryptic 
remarks, clumsily try to block Faraday from looking at blueprints, 
etc., etc. Hell, the monster on the wing of the plane in the 
"Twilight Zone" story was more subtle than these two.
Mark Pellington is a talented man. He took big chances with his first 
film, "Going All the Way," and turned out an extremely dark, faithful 
adaptation of Dan Wakefield's caustic coming-of-age novel. But he 
shows no finesse here, devoting too much time to arty shots of 
shadows and light when he should have been adjusting the screenplay 
to make the plot seem more credible. Instead, we get people popping 
up on the lead characters at just the right time to startle them and 
the audience, regardless of how improbable their arrival might be, 
and we get an incredibly elaborate plan that could not succeed unless 
the conspirators had a psychic awareness of upcoming totally random 
actions on the part of several key individuals. 
Despite such fundamental problems, "Arlington Road" does contain some 
rewards. Tim Robbins gives a good performance and his personal code 
of honor is one of the film's most fascinating elements. Joan Cusack 
and Hope Davis do what they can with their characters, but the women 
are given short-shrift by the screenplay. 
Faraday's early statement to his students is a powerful one, 
reinforced by the surprising twist at the end of "Arlington Road." As 
such, even with its ludicrous screenplay and overwrought lead 
performance, the film still manages to pack a punch. Had the script 
been rewritten with an eye toward making the plot mechanics more 
plausible (even in light of the closing revelations, the Lang's 
behavior and many crucial elements of the grand conspiracy remain 
patently unbelievable), and had Pellington and Bridges worked 
together on toning down Faraday's histrionics, this could have been 
much more than just another popcorn thriller.

"The Mexican" opens with a whale of a battle between Samantha (Julia
Roberts) and Jerry (Brad Pitt). After promising to stop working as a
gofer for criminal big shots, Jerry is about to leave for the proverbial
"one last job." He stands on the sidewalk pleading his case while
Samantha pelts him from their second story apartment with his own
balled-up clothing. That the couple has attended numerous counseling
sessions becomes obvious when Samantha, outraged by one of Jerry's
statements, shifts into therapy speak, shouting "Did you just
blame-shift? Are you blame-shifting?!"
When Samantha and Jerry part company, you know they will be reunited by
the end of the film. Happily, that's about the only thing that is
certain in this wonderfully quirky
comedy-drama-adventure-romance-thriller-western-road movie. The
convoluted storyline is overwritten and occasionally confusing, but "The
Mexican" more than makes up for its problem areas, thanks to strong
contrasts in atmosphere, bold use of music, terrific dialogue and an
extraordinary ensemble cast.
After their confrontation, Samantha and Jerry head off in different
directions. Given the choice of cooperation or death, reluctant bagman
Jerry flies to Mexico to retrieve a gorgeous hand-made pistol called the
Mexican for a mob boss. Meanwhile, Samantha starts a long drive to Las
Vegas to begin a new career.
But nothing goes as planned. In a picturesque village, Jerry gets the
gun with relative ease, but has a hell of a time keeping hold of it. The
Mexican is cursed (we see three versions of the pivotal moment when the
pistol became a legend) and so, it seems, is Jerry. After several
disastrous attempts to complete the mission, his best friend and
colleague, Ted (J.K. Simmons) arrives to help. Ah, but who is he really
working for?
Things are just as bad on the domestic front. To ensure that the Mexican
reaches its intended destination, a notorious hit man named Leroy (James
Gandolfini) takes Samantha hostage. If Jerry accomplishes his task,
Samantha will go free, but if he fails...
The film hops back and forth between the respective adventures of
Samantha and Jerry, with the neon lights of Las Vegas offering a sharp
contrast to the weathered village of Real de Catorce, located in the
northern central highlands of Mexico. Director Gore Verbinski ("Mouse
Hunt") gets the most out of both locations. To his credit, he navigates
the color wheel of Las Vegas without ever doing the standard montage of
twinkling casino signs. The scenes in Real de Catorce are even more
visually rich. Located 8,000 feet up in the mountains, the city is
accessible only via a 15.5-mile cobblestone road that goes to the 1.5
mile Ogarrio Tunnel, a one-lane former mine shaft that leads into the
city. The town is a perfect movie locale  while it would likely be
insufferably hot and dusty in real life, it has an otherworldly allure
on-screen.
The contrasts between the journeys of Samantha and Jerry are just as
distinct. For Jerry, miscommunication is the operative word, as he deals
with the language barrier while trying to determine who is telling him
the truth and who is lying. Brad Pitt does wonderful work defining his
character, a well-intentioned goof who is dense, but not stupid. He uses
his whole body, drawing slapstick laughs with his flailing limbs without
ever going over the top. After a series of fine turns in grim roles,
what a delight it is to see Pitt using his great skills for comedic
effect. J.K. Simmons  best known as uber-villain Vern Shillinger in the
HBO prison drama, "Oz"  deftly plays off the anxiety of Pitt's
character by keeping Ted casual, from his low-key demeanor to his
just-off-the-tourist-rack clothing.
For Samantha, communication is everything. The hostage-captor dynamic
changes as she and Leroy bond, discussing relationship issues in a
manner that would make Oprah proud. Julia Roberts delivers a strong
performance as a person that expresses every emotion she feels, for
better or worse. James Gandolfini, who achieved leading man status as
the patriarch in the smash HBO series, "The Sopranos," tempers his
menacing frame with silky sensitivity as Leroy, a mobster who fears he
will never find true love. The evolution of the two characters is
credible and the exchanges between Samantha and Leroy are both funny and
sweet.
While the supporting cast is quite colorful, Pitt, Roberts, Gandolfini
and Simmons own "The Mexican." The often violent storyline, which nods
to both Quentin Tarantino and Sam Peckinpah, tries a little too hard
and, in the latter minutes of the film, frays at the edges, but it
doesn't matter. The four actors and their well-defined characters are so
likable that plot becomes irrelevant. Watching them interact is pleasure
enough. Placing them in a clever story accented with great looking
surroundings and bang-up music simply adds icing to the cake.

In 1998, the police buddy-movie "Rush Hour" clicked with audiences due
to the inspired pairing of lovable action star Jackie Chan and
motormouth comic Chris Tucker. My review of the original stated "Tucker
slightly tones down his hyperactive, helium-voiced, in-your-face
chatter, making his character humorously abrasive rather than
insufferable. He's actually quite fun to watch as he talks his way in
and out of trouble, periodically breaking into a bizarre urban-Egyptian
form of dance and using leering effeminate movements to challenge other
males. I have no idea how Tucker developed his alien-on-amphetamines
shtick, but he's certainly one of a kind."
The bad news about "Rush Hour 2" is that Tucker doesn't tone down
anything this time around. The good news is that Jackie Chan's
performance is so strong that he makes up for the excesses of his
partner. To be fair, I should note that Tucker does have some effective
scenes. My favorite (SPOILER ALERT: The rest of this paragraph reveals
two jokes) takes place at a Las Vegas casino, where he attempts to draw
the attention of security by breaking into a strident rant accusing the
facility of racism. During his tirade, he announces that black people
have suffered the abuse of whites "for 362 years," which I believe marks
the first time anyone has ever pinned it down so precisely. Seconds
later, when a defensive white official denies that the casino is racist,
citing the fact that Lionel Richie is playing there, Tucker's character
shouts, "Lionel Richie? Lionel Richie hasn't been black since he left
the Commodores!"
If only the rest of his work was so consistently funny. There were times
when I wanted to climb into the screen, slap Tucker silly and force-feed
him Ritalin. Thank Goodness for the soothing presence of Jackie Chan,
who gets more charming with each passing year. His athletic abilities
are as strong as ever and his skill as an actor keeps improving, as does
his command of English.
The sequel opens in Hong Kong, where LAPD detective Carter (Tucker) is
vacationing with Chief Inspector Lee (Chan). Carter just wants to visit
with his friend and sample the exotic pleasures of the city, especially
the women. But the guys soon get caught up in a huge case. An explosion
at the American Embassy kills two U.S. Customs agents that had been
investigating smugglers trafficking in "superbills," extremely
high-grade counterfeit American $100 bills.
The main suspect in the bombing is Ricky Tan (John Lone), the suave
leader of the deadliest gang in China. Lee approaches the case with a
fervor, because Tan was once a Hong Kong police officer partnered with
Lee's father and was directly involved in his death. Lee and Carter's
pursuit of Tan leads them through a variety of colorful locations,
including a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a yacht party on the
waters of Victoria Harbor. The massage parlor visit, by the way,
features a beautifully choreographed fight scene that ends with the
lawmen unceremoniously thrown bare-assed onto a busy city street.
The duo also must deal with Tan's right hand woman, Hu Li (Zhang Ziyi
from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), mega-rich hotel and casino owner
Steven Reign (comedian Alan King) and Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez),
who is either an undercover U.S. agent or a turncoat aligned with Tan.
The chase takes Lee and Carter back to Los Angeles briefly and then on
to Las Vegas for the climax of the film, set on the Strip at the opening
of the Red Dragon Hotel and Casino.
At one point in the proceedings, I jotted "too much plot" in my
notebook, but the rousing finale suitably deals with all the elements
and characters raised in the story. And while Jackie Chan tosses off
lots of one-liners, he plays Lee's relationship with the man that killed
his father completely serious, which makes the plot seem like more than
just an excuse for jokes and stunts.
As with the vast majority of sequels, "Rush Hour 2" isn't as good as the
original, but it offers more than enough entertainment to warrant your
time and money (the riotous outtakes that run over the closing credits
are funnier than most of the films passing as comedies this summer). If
the series continues, and it certainly appears on track to do so, I hope
future installments focus more on the camaraderie between the leads and
less on their bickering. There are plenty of bureaucrats and bad guys
ripe for them to belittle, let the boys play nice with each other. Other
suggestions: Write stories that get both Lee and Carter emotionally
involved in the case, keep the jokes and imaginative fight scenes coming
and, for Pete's Sake, tone down Chris Tucker. Jackie Chan has proven his
ability to be humorous and serious in the same film, give Tucker the
opportunity to do the same.

In the insular world of film criticism, the hot topic last week was the
romantic tearjerker, "Autumn in New York." First, MGM refused to screen
the movie for reviewers, generally a sure sign of a cinematic dog. Then,
stars Richard Gere and Winona Ryder publicly condemned the decision,
asserting their strong support of the finished product (as best I can
tell, this was the only thing either actor did to publicize the flick).
MGM countered by claiming they were withholding the film only to prevent
writers from giving away key plot points. Their argument appeared
suspect at best, given that trailers for the movie revealed those "key
plot points."
On opening day, critics hit their local multiplexes, eager to be among
the first to weigh in on the production. I scanned the reviews and the
prevailing reaction seemed to be "Well, it wasn't as bad as I expected."
What a resounding endorsement.
To be fair, "Autumn in New York" has good and bad points. On the plus
side, there's lots of lovely scenic footage of New York City and Richard
Gere's hair. On the minus side, there's the script and the casting. See,
it all balances out.
Richard Gere plays Will Keane, an incredibly successful 48-year-old
Manhattan restaurateur who is far better looking than any of the
celebrity chefs on the Food Network. He has a wonderful head of mostly
white hair that looks as if teams of stylists spend hours every day
making sure it is tousled just right.
While schmoozing at his restaurant one evening, Will and his hair
encounter Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) at a dinner party. Charlotte
is a spunky 21-year-old revered by her friends for her ability to make
kicky hats that resemble pipe cleaner party favors.
Will, a notorious love 'em and leave 'em playboy, sets his sights on
Charlotte, hiring her to construct a hat for a phantom date. When she
shows up with her creation, he claims that he was stood up and asks her
to try on the dress intended for his date. Miracle of miracles, the
dress  a horrific evening gown draped with dozens of what appear to be
fishing lures  fits perfectly. Like a pair of giddy kids, they head out
for a magical Manhattan dream date. Charlotte, by the way, does not wear
the pipe cleaner hat. Continuity error or simply good taste on
Charlotte's part? You make the call.
To its credit, the story directly addresses the dreamy couples' massive
gap in age. Unfortunately, the filmmakers beat the subject to death. One
particularly groan-worthy exchange has Will asking, "You think I'm too
old?" and Charlotte responding, "I collect antiques."
Regardless of their age difference, Richard Gere and Winona Ryder are
never credible as a couple. During their intimate moments, Gere looks
like he's preparing to bite Ryder's neck and suck her blood. And Ryder
appears as uncomfortable as a cat being cradled in a toddler's arms.
The secondary players represent some unusual casting choices. Anthony
LaPaglia strolls in periodically as Will's best buddy, giving a
performance that seems edited in from a different movie. Late in the
story, when a character requires medical attention, a gifted surgeon is
recruited for the job and I was startled to see J.K. Simmons pop up in
the role. HBO subscribers know Simmons from the addictive prison soap
opera, "Oz," where he stars as sadistic white supremacist Schillinger,
the most diabolical of the inmates. When Simmons started dispensing
medical advice in "Autumn," I fought the urge to shout, "He's lying!
It's all part of his twisted plan to destroy poor Tobias Beecher, the
lawyer who ran over the little girl while he was drunk!" Pardon my
digression into dementia, folks. I now return you to the regularly
scheduled review.
Director Joan Chen ("Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl") catches the viewer's
eye with numerous picture postcard shots of NYC, although her insistence
on using weather and flying birds footage as metaphors grows tiresome.
Meanwhile, writer Allison Burnett loads the script with cheesy,
embarrassing or simply awkward lines. While we're used to hearing movie
characters deliver cumbersome, information-packed soliloquies in order
to provide viewers with needed background details, was it really
necessary to have Will ask his adult daughter, "How is Millie, your
mother?"
Despite the leaden writing, veteran actor Elaine Stritch creates the
story's most engaging character in Dolly, Charlotte's grandmother: a
vinegary, weathered old lady whose depth provides a neat contrast to
Will's Peter Pan demeanor. One small change would have made "Autumn in
New York" a better film. Instead of Winona Ryder, Richard Gere should
have fallen in love with Elaine Stritch. The age difference between the
actors is about the same, but the pairing would have been infinitely
more intriguing. Oh sure, Gere would have vetoed the idea in a second,
but I bet his hair would have been in favor of it.

Unpolished and ungainly, but thoroughly likable, "Blast From The Past" is 
the conceptual opposite of last year's magnificent "Pleasantville." Where 
"Pleasantville" magically threw two contemporary teens into the 
monochromatic world of a "Father Knows Best" style '50s sitcom, "Blast 
>From The Past" takes a young man raised in complete isolation with 
wholesome early '60s values and thrusts him into modern-day Los Angeles. 
But while "Pleasantville" addressed a variety of serious issues, "Blast 
>From The Past" makes only passing glances at social commentary, instead 
keeping the focus on silliness. Due to some inspired casting choices, the 
fish-out-of-water comedy succeeds more often than not.
It begins in 1962, at a cocktail party held by affluent suburbanite 
Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) and his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy 
Spacek). Moments after friends in another room remark that Calvin, while 
a brilliant scientist and wonderful husband, is more than a little 
paranoid, President Kennedy appears on TV with grim news about the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. Fearing the worst, Webber sends his guests home, then 
retreats to the family's incredibly elaborate bomb shelter, hidden 
beneath the house. Just as he is closing the hatch, a small plane crashes 
into his roof. Mistakenly convinced that the Big One has decimated the 
planet, Webber sets the shelter release timer for 35 years, his estimate 
of when it will be safe to return to the surface.
With their radio destroyed by the plane crash, the Webbers are completely 
isolated from the outside, sealed into a 1962 mindset. When Helen gives 
birth, the couple optimistically christen the child Adam and devote 
themselves to raising the consummate Renaissance man. Adam grows into 
adulthood with dreams of seeing the sky, while Dad teaches him about 
science, sports and the art of avoiding both Communists and post-war 
mutants. Meanwhile, Mom schools the boy in manners, dance and proper 
courtship of young ladies. Finally, the day comes for the now-grown Adam 
(Brendan Fraser) to venture forth onto the surface, which, on a drizzly 
night in urban L.A., bears a remarkable resemblance to the post-Atomic 
world his father anticipated.
"Blast From The Past" is divided into two sections. The first, a portrait 
of the Webbers' life underground, works because it offers the rare 
opportunity to watch Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek do comedy. 
Walken takes his standard slightly-demented persona and gives it a benign 
twist, with delightful results. While bemoaning the destruction of 
humanity, Calvin thrives in the bomb shelter, quite pleased with himself 
for having the foresight and resourcefulness to have sealed his family 
safely from the devastation. Walken makes Calvin an appealing anachronism,
 a deliciously geeky spin on Ward Cleaver. Meanwhile, Spacek plays Helen 
as June Cleaver quietly coming apart at the seams. Ever the dutiful wife 
and mother, she nonetheless succumbs to a massive case of cabin fever, 
seeking solace by taking slugs of any available liquor. The desperate 
character could have become cartoonish or tragic, but Spacek maintains 
just the right tone to keep Helen believable and funny.
The second part of the film chronicles Adam's adventures on the surface, 
with a nifty performance from Brendan Fraser making up for numerous weak 
spots. Fraser is an exceptional serious actor, most recently evidenced by 
his outstanding work in "Gods and Monsters," but he also possesses a real 
gift for comedy, particularly when playing lovable, innocent goofballs. 
Fraser shined in "George of the Jungle" because, instead of being overly 
cautious about protecting his leading man image, he threw himself into 
the role completely, and his gusto was irresistible. He is particularly 
adroit here, beginning his journey as a total babe-in-the-woods, then, 
using a series of subtle stylistic moves, transforming Adam into a 
romantic hero, without ever betraying the character.
I wish more of Fraser's portion of the film had shown such subtlety. A 
running gag about a group of burn-outs who build a cult around the 
Webbers would have been funnier if it had been toned down. As a cynical 
young woman who reluctantly serves as mentor for Adam (guess what her 
first name is), Alicia Silverstone must act excessively wary of him 
solely because that's how romantic comedies are structured. Silverstone 
displays ample energy, but her suspicious shtick grows old quickly. 
On a brighter note, "NewsRadio" star Dave Foley takes one of contemporary 
film's most tiresome character clichés, the gay best friend, and makes 
him sparkle, using his limpid eyes and sharp phrasing to maximum effect. 
For fans of Foley's "The Kids in the Hall" days, he plays Troy as an 
smart, sincere cross between Hecubus and the "Steps" guy. For everybody 
else, well... he's damn good.   
Despite being structurally sloppy and going for the obvious jokes too 
often, "Blast From The Past" is a lot of fun, thanks to some ingenious 
moments and the efforts of its exceptional cast. No one will mistake this 
for comic gold, but it's an amusing, affable way to spend 106 minutes, 
and sometimes that's enough.

You should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the 
"Odd Couple II" sneak preview. They were as happy a group of men as I've 
ever encountered. "What a great movie," exclaimed one gent at the urinal, 
"Everything was so true!" "Yeah," laughed a man standing next to him, "I 
drive as slow as that one guy did. My kids give me holy hell for it!" 
"And peeing is a big part of my day, just like with Felix," chuckled 
another fellow, as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and 
prepared to rejoin his wife. 
If you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour 
below the posted speed limit, "Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II" may be 
just the film for you. Others will likely be less charitable. While "The 
Odd Couple II" is amiable enough, Neil Simon's shockingly lazy screenplay 
feels like a slapped-together TV reunion show, suffering from wheezing 
situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the Borscht-belt. 
Simon, once the toast of Broadway, has apparently shifted his sights from 
the Great White Way to the neighborhood multiplex in Branson, Missouri. 
The contrived story, involving the marriage of their kids, provides the 
excuse for a reunion between Oscar Madison and Felix Unger, who haven't 
seen each other in 17 years. The former roommates fly into California 
from their respective homes for the wedding and, quite literally, run 
into one another at the airport. They take off in a rental car for the 
ceremony in San Molina, get lost and have a series of "wacky" adventures 
on the road. 
Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau reprise their roles as Felix the neat 
freak and Oscar the slob. While there is an undeniable chemistry between 
the pair, the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that 
they've headlined three films together since 1993: "Grumpy Old Men," 
"Grumpier Old Men" and "Out To Sea." Still, the two veteran actors are 
fun to watch. 
Matthau, whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of 
laundry with eyes, has a field day as Oscar, the crown prince of the 
curmudgeons. Lemmon, looking pastier than usual, is fine as the ever-
annoying Felix, who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional 
allergic honks of "Phnah! Phnah!" Despite their bickering, the characters 
have real affection for each other, providing a welcome respite from the 
non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films 
together.
Unfortunately, Matthau and Lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for 
Simon's hack script, which wouldn't pass muster even on a UPN sitcom. One 
contrived situation follows another, lathered with enough stale one-
liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local 
comedy club. 
If someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as I was,
 try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements. Burger 
King gets one, as does the El Pollo Loco taco joint, but Budget Rent-A-
Car really hits the jackpot. Between script references to their business 
and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name, I couldn't 
keep count of all the plugs. I did, however, keep track of some of the 
swearing. I came up with four "God-damns," three "shitheads" and two 
"fucks." The inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a 
film aimed at an older audience, but the theater full of seniors appeared 
to have no problem with them, howling like crazy every time the boys let 
rip with a naughty word. 
It's sad that a writer of Neil Simon's stature has grown desperate enough 
to resort to swearing for cheap laughs, but not surprising when you look 
at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise. One running 
gag involves Oscar and Felix's inability to remember the name of the town 
where the wedding is to be held. At one point, the men actually spend 30 
seconds just free-associating, riffing off variants of the word "San." 
The sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing.
One of the oldest maxims of film-going is "Beware of movies that use the 
author's name in the title." "Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II" is no 
exception to the rule. While the production has enough minor pleasures to 
warrant a TV viewing on some lazy Sunday afternoon, it has no business 
playing in a movie theater. Of course, there's a bathroom full of old 
guys who would strongly disagree with every word I've written, and would 
probably whip my "young-whippersnapper" ass to boot. One thing's for sure,
 though. They'll never catch me in a car chase.

In Spike Lee's crackling "Summer of Sam," the lead character is not an 
individual, but an entire neighborhood; specifically, a Bronx 
neighborhood in 1977, when the killing spree of a demented postal worker 
took an already blistering New York summer and cranked the temperature 
even a few degrees higher. Like "Do The Right Thing," Lee's best film, 
this is a kinetic tapestry about temptation, anger, bigotry and paranoia, 
one which gives the viewer a sense that everything is about to come apart 
and we are witnessing the last few moments before the meltdown. "Summer 
of Sam" has moments that are tough to watch, but for the most part, they 
are so well-presented that it is impossible to avert your eyes.    
Writer Jimmy Breslin sets the scene, and in short order, we witness a 
figure lumbering through the night; David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam 
killer, committing his sixth and seventh murders. While the entire city 
is galvanized by the crimes, the film follows one group of people near 
the heart of the madness. John Leguizamo is Vinny, a hairdresser who 
routinely cheats on his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino), seeking out women who 
will do the things he dares not request of his spouse, then wallowing in 
guilt over his actions. Dionna, who works in her father's Italian 
restaurant, pretends not to notice her husband's philandering and tries 
to come up with something, anything, that will inspire him in their own 
bed.
Meanwhile, Vinny's best friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) has shaken up the 
locals by adopting the punk look, sporting spiked hair, freaky clothing, 
a bad English accent and loads of attitude. To them, he has mutated into 
some bizarre and possibly dangerous alien life form. Even after he hooks 
up with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), the official neighborhood slut, he 
continues working as a dancer/hustler in a seedy gay nightspot, while 
pursuing dreams of musical stardom in the burgeoning punk scene at CBGB's.
As the Son of Sam continues his reign of terror, now sending letters to 
Jimmy Breslin boasting of his actions, the citywide tension escalates. 
Street traffic decreases as people stay in the safety of their homes, 
while many of the women who do venture out color their hair blond or don 
wigs, because the female victims thus far have been brunettes. Two police 
officers approach local crime lord Luigi (Ben Gazzara) for help and soon, 
the neighborhood good old boys are organizing to patrol the streets and 
find the killer themselves. Suspicion rises along with the heat as 
collective mood moves closer and closer to some dread precipice.
Spike Lee is a master at image manipulation and does fine work here, 
deftly incorporating period music, very effective lighting (particularly 
strobe effects and various white lights) and fragments of grainy footage 
at just the right moments to create a riveting feel of immediacy. The 
only time he falters is in his depiction of the twisted mind of the 
killer. Shots of David Berkowitz flailing about his apartment, shrieking 
at a barking dog, look stagy and unconvincing. One particularly daring 
scene shows a dog actually speaking to Berkowitz, courtesy of computer 
graphics. Instead of seeming horrific, the image just looks gimmicky, 
drawing laughs instead of shivers.
Aside from the Berkowitz interludes, Lee's stylings achieve the desired 
effects, drawing us into the various individual vignettes while remaining 
focused on the bigger picture of the dissolution of a neighborhood. Vinny 
and Dionna desperately try to keep their marriage together, visiting 
Studio 54 and Plato's Retreat along the way; Ritchie persists in his 
strange personal odyssey; and the tension keeps growing as the first 
anniversary of the initial Son of Sam attack draws near, with the killer 
promising to celebrate the occasion.  
I've heard complaints that too many of the secondary characters in 
"Summer of Sam" are rough sketches at best and stereotypes at worst, but 
I didn't find them troubling, because this is a film about a group 
mentality rather than sharply defined personal profiles. That said, the 
lead characters all do fine work, particularly Leguizamo and Sorvino, 
both of whom provide appropriate depth and richness to their characters.  
While not approaching the glimmering perfection of "Do The Right Thing," 
"Summer of Sam" is another impressive step in Spike Lee's evolution as a 
filmmaker. His innovative techniques are less obtrusive than in previous 
works, efficiently serving this disturbing tale of the variances of 
societal tides without coming off like showboating. Except for the 
talking dog, of course.

You don't need to be a Star Trek connoisseur to enjoy "Trekkies," an 
affectionate portrait of some the more "colorful" fans of the ubiquitous 
sci-fi phenomenon. The funniest documentary since "Cane Toads: An 
Unnatural History," "Trekkies" draws more belly laughs than any film in 
recent memory, including "There's Something About Mary." 
Working on a shoestring budget with film stock of varying qualities, 
director Roger Nygard copes by editing "Trekkies" in the herky-jerky 
style popularized by MTV. In fact, an apt subtitle for the film would be 
"The Unreal World." Denise Crosby, Tasha Yar from "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," serves as tour guide into the realm of Trek fandom, setting 
the benign, nonjudgmental tone that makes the feature work so well. While 
I enjoyed Michael Moore's "Roger and Me" and "The Big One," how 
refreshing it is to see a humorous documentary that doesn't batter its 
subjects with snide commentary. "Trekkies" simply lets the fans speak for 
themselves, with hilarious results.   
Working off a "schematic" scrawled on a piece of notebook paper, one 
fellow shows off a glittery ball with assorted attachments. "It's a 
Romulan cloaking device," he explains without a hint of irony, "but I 
think I can modify it to work on a Federation ship." You know, I bet he 
can. Watch a befuddled Radio Shack clerk, eyeing the camera warily while 
the Trekkie shops for parts. Try, just try, to keep a straight face as 
the Uberfan tools down the street in his customized Captain Pike life-
support motorized space-chair, with only his head sticking out of the 
bizarre contraption. As if the spectacle isn't freaky enough, he sports a 
brown corduroy winter hat with earflaps because, hey, it's chilly out 
there.
We also meet Barbara Adams, an employee of the Sir Speedy print shop who 
gained national prominence when, as a Whitewater trial juror, she 
insisted on wearing her Federation uniform to court. "Every day I would 
walk past the reporters with a Vulcan-like stoicism," she says with pride,
 before launching into a sermon on the ideals espoused by "Star Trek."
The original "Star Trek" debuted in the '60s, when the Vietnam war and 
sweeping social changes were turning the country upside down. The show 
presented a vision of a future where mankind not only survived, but 
thrived, with adventurers of varying races and nationalities united as 
they explored the far reaches of the heavens. Despite the mini-skirted 
sexism and imperialistic undertones of the show (as well as a notable 
lack of gays that continues to this day), the optimism of the series 
resonated with a determined group of disenfranchised viewers. More than 
30 years, three TV series, nine films and countless books later, "Star 
Trek" lives on.
There's a sweet naiveté beneath the ridiculous costumes and garish make-
up of these "Star Trek" fans that makes their eccentricities, if not 
necessarily endearing, at least understandable. Faced with a tumultuous, 
uncertain world, they've elected to move to a nicer one. I laughed at 
Gabriel, a 14-year old computer whiz who fusses over the detailing of his 
Federation outfits while over-enunciating multi-syllable words, but I 
also remembered my own painful adolescence enough to like him.  
Some of the folks are considerably weirder. There's the transvestite 
Trekkie who dresses as the nameless wife of some obscure peripheral 
character, the guy considering having plastic surgery done to give his 
ears Vulcan-shaped points, and the "Spiner-Femme" who displays an album 
stuffed with photos of Brent Spiner (Data from "The Next Generation"), 
before aiming her telescope into the distance and wistfully noting that 
she can almost see the roof of the actor's home. Incidentally, I'm barely 
scraping the surface here. Wait until you hear about the "Q" virus!
"Trekkies" gets a bit stuffy towards the end, devoting too much footage 
to testimonials about the spirit of "Star Trek" before recovering with a 
last dash of humor, but that's a minor quibble. The film is an absolute 
hoot, an extremely funny cavalcade of outrageous fans who, outlandish 
costumes aside, are just people like the rest of us. At one time or 
another, we all get passionate and obsessive about something. We may not 
dress like Klingons or wave around phasers, but when you come right down 
to it, we're all pretty damn silly. Trekkies just wear their goofiness 
with pride.
A Discussion with Denise Crosby and Roger Nygard of "Trekkies"
Whether you're filming the founder of the Interstellar Language School, a 
man who legally changed his name to James T. Kirk, or a group of Klingons 
dining at a fast food joint, the trick is to avoid making color 
commentary. That's the philosophy behind "Trekkies," a hilarious 
documentary about Star Trek fandom. "We knew the audience would get it," 
explained Denise Crosby, co-executive producer of the film. "Just let 
them reveal themselves and tell their tales and you'll be touched, you'll 
be moved, you'll laugh, you'll go 'Oh my God, I thought I had some odd 
pastimes!'"
Crosby and "Trekkies" director Roger Nygard talked "Trek" during an 
interview at a downtown Indianapolis hotel. I congratulated Crosby, who 
just finished a year-long break after appearing in "Deep Impact" and 
having a baby, on her personal restraint in "Trekkies." Where many actors 
would have hogged the camera, Crosby served only as a pleasant, subdued 
host to the proceedings. She responded, "It was refreshing, actually, to 
be in that position. I can't stand that bombarding ego that actors have, 
so I was really happy to just kind of... " Nygard finished her sentence, 
saying "Be the Anti-Shatner?" The pair broke into gales of laughter over 
the dig at William Shatner, the notorious ham who played Captain Kirk. 
Crosby threw up her arms and gleefully shouted, "Yes, that's it, I am the 
Anti-Shatner!"
Denise Crosby gained fame as Tasha Yar on "Star Trek: The Next Generation,
" considered by many to be the best incarnation of the venerable 
franchise. Several months into the series' extremely shaky first season, 
she asked to be written out, frustrated with scripts that left her 
standing around far too often. "I was going to become sort of lobotomized 
if I stayed on the show much longer," she said. Ironically, the episode 
where her character was killed offered her a long, eloquent monologue, 
exactly the kind of material she had craved in the first place. "It was 
very beautifully written, and really hit some personal notes, how I 
personally felt about all those actors," she explained. As to the rather 
arbitrary method the writers used to dispose of Tasha Yar, she said, "I 
knew the concept that Gene Roddenberry was after, that my character's 
death should be so unprovoked and so sudden that it would render itself 
horrific, but in hindsight it just fell flat. I think most people felt 
that, here you are killing off a well-loved character and it should have 
been more spectacular."
I asked about one the first season's most notorious episodes, a story 
which reinforced negative racial stereotypes. "We were just talking about 
this," Crosby said. "I think that show will go down in history... people 
will scratch their heads and say 'How did this ever get on the air?' I 
mean, they finally have a planet that's populated with a black race and 
then they present them as savage warriors, and the men want the white 
girl!" Shaking her head and laughing, she went on. "And they speak like 
the guy from the old Cola-nut commercials! Oh my God, I was just rolling 
my eyes the whole time."
In subsequent seasons, when the quality of the show radically improved, 
did she ever regret leaving the series? "You know, I never looked back," 
she answered. "I'm going to be really honest, I've never seen an episode 
since I left the show and I've never seen 'Voyager' or 'Deep Space Nine.' 
It's not that I have some sort of distaste for it, there's just not a lot 
of TV that I do watch. I watch films." "And documentaries!" Nygard 
chirped with a grin.
Crosby remained close with several cast members after leaving the show 
and was pleasantly surprised when the producers invited her to revisit 
her role in a superb time-travel story. The episode, "Yesterday's 
Enterprise," caught her by surprise. "When I left the show, that was it," 
she explained. "I had no plans of ever returning, I was dead. And then 
they called me up and said they had this idea and would I be interested? 
I said 'Absolutely.' They sent me this great script and I thought 'This 
is so clever! This is wild!' I had a great time doing it. And I got to 
work with Whoopi Goldberg, which I had missed due to my departure." 
The success of the episode led to Crosby's idea for another character. 
Sela would be the child of Tasha Yar, born when she traveled backwards 
through time (don't ask). In Crosby's conception, the child would be a 
human raised by the Romulans, enemies of the Federation. "I had a meeting 
with Rick Berman (head honcho for the franchise after Roddenberry's 
death) and pitched the story," she said. "He kind of went away and 
thought about it for a couple of months, then called me and said they 
wanted to go with the idea, but with the slight variation that Tasha was 
pregnant by a Romulan general, so she had a half-human, half Romulan 
daughter." Nygard laughed and added, "Yeah, with the slight variation 
that you don't get paid for the idea!" Crosby appeared as Sela, and was 
invited back as Tasha Yar for the series' grand finale. "I thought that 
was really nice, actually," she said. "That was a surprise. I just had 
wished that Wil Wheaton was there. He was missing from the last show and 
it would have been nice if everyone could have been there."
Crosby met Nygard in 1991, when he cast her in the comedy "High Strung." 
A veteran guest at numerous "Star Trek" conventions, she proposed the 
idea of a documentary about the fans to Nygard, amazed that one hadn't 
been made already. Producer Keith Border financed the film through his 
company and shooting began in 1996.
The team received no help from Paramount, parent company for the "Trek" 
franchise. Instead, they attended conventions, ambushing cast members for 
interviews and eventually shooting 35 hours worth of footage. So when did 
Paramount, distributor of "Trekkies," finally embraced the film? "When we 
had an offer from a competing studio," laughed Nygard. "We always wanted 
to give them the benefit of first choice," said Crosby, "because 'Star 
Trek' is their franchise and I have a history with the studio, but they 
weren't jumping to the mat, so we shopped it around. Our lawyers got back 
to them and said 'We're moments away from letting so and so have this 
film. Does that interest you at all?' Boom. Offer's on the table."
Crosby and Nygard, who is currently finishing "Six Days in Roswell," a 
documentary about UFO enthusiasts, may do a follow-up "Trek" documentary 
focusing on the vast European fan base. They're not overly concerned 
about offending Trekkies. Nygard explains that any fan going out in 
public in "Trek" regalia knows they'll be noticed and possibly laughed at,
 and is willing to accept the consequences. Referring to one fan who 
tools around in a motorized "Trek" space-chair, he said affectionately, 
"That's just his preferred mode of transportation, because it shows his 
love of 'Star Trek.'"

After the press screening of "Moulin Rouge," I stood in the lobby of the
theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues.
Everyone seemed a bit numb, understandable after sitting through a
barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images. A pal of mine simply
said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to
see it. Another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production,
while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye. When
one fellow quietly stated "I've never really been a fan of musicals,"
the statement surprised me because, even though the story is told almost
completely through song, I didn't think of it as a musical. There is so
much going on in "Moulin Rouge" that "musical" seems too small a term to
cover it.
"Moulin Rouge" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off
to the Big Tub O' Adjectives in search of proper words to describe the
experience. Australian director Baz Luhrmann, the man behind "Strictly
Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet," fills the heads of viewers with unique
camerawork, opulent imagery and songs ranging from "The Sound of Music"
to "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Sumptuous and beautiful, vulgar and
overdone, "Moulin Rogue" travels through the looking glass while an
ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on
the "random" setting.
"It was 1899, the summer of love... " Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a
penniless young writer newly arrived in Paris, "to write about truth,
beauty, freedom and love," where he encounters a group of bohemians, led
by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Christian meets Satine
(Nicole Kidman), a courtesan from the legendary Moulin Rogue, and his
world transforms from black and white to technicolor. At once fragile
and vivacious, the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet
without even trying. Christian instantly falls in love with her and
Satine finds herself smitten with him as well, which is quite a
hindrance for someone in her profession.
Working with the bohemians and Moulin Rogue impresario Harold Zidler
(Jim Broadbent), Christian writes an opus modestly named "Spectacular
Spectacular." Zidler quickly finds a backer, the wealthy Duke of Monroth
(Richard Roxburgh), but there's a catch  the duke also wants the hand
of the fair Satine. As if all that isn't enough, Satine has a cough, and
while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold, it rarely
turns out to be anything that simple in Movie Land.
Like a teeter-totter, "Moulin Rogue" moves up and down between the
ridiculous and the sublime. One of the loveliest moments comes as
Christine and Satine commune outdoors at night, becoming part of a
defiantly unrealistic Parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy
tales. Together they dance, while serenaded by the man in the moon
(Alessandro Safina provides the vocals), apparently transported from the
classic Georges Méličs silent film to guard the nocturnal sky.
Other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload.
The cavorting of Toulouse-Lautrec and his comrades gets strained at
times and some of their overt comedy, accompanied by cartoon sound
effects, is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like
"Bewitched" beat into the ground.
Of course, sensory overload was exactly what Baz Luhrmann had in mind.
"We never heard from Baz to turn it down," one of the actors told the
Los Angeles Times. "It was always, 'More! More!'" The director even sent
a note to his cast reading, "I dare you to make me say you've gone too
far."
The musical numbers reflect his attitude. One knockout piece, the
"Elephant Love Medley," incorporates the Beatles' "All You Need Is
Love," U2's "In the Name of Love," Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love
You" and Elton John and Bernie Taupin's "Your Song." Need more? How
about "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" spiced with portions of
"Material Girl?"
Luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that, together, add
up to something messy, but often wonderful. Ewan McGregor is extremely
likable as Christian, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet.
McGregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right
moments. Once labeled the "Ice Queen," Nicole Kidman melts that
characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance. She handles
the songs adroitly, although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper
range. Veteran character actor Jim Broadbent is suitably larger than
life as ringmaster Zidler  wait until you see him perform "Like a
Virgin." As the buffoonish duke, Richard Roxburgh proves to be the
film's weakest link, although I'm sure he was simply following
instructions.
I suspect "Moulin Rogue" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films.
While I didn't completely love it, I most certainly liked it a lot. Over
the course of a year, I see well over 300 movies, and most of them look
like Xeroxes of each other. "Moulin Rogue" is an original, and an
original, even a flawed one, is a thing to be cherished.

Review for Mars Attacks! (1996)
MARS ATTACKS! (1996)
Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito,
 Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger, Tom 
Jones, Lukas Haas, Natalie Portman, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, Paul Winfield, 
Sylvia Sidney, Lisa Marie, Joe Don Baker, Christina Applegate, Barbet 
Schroeder. Directed by Tim Burton.
Rated PG-13, **** stars (out of ***** stars)
"Mars Attacks!" is the kind of movie your parents desperately tried to 
keep you from seeing when you were little. In fact, this deliriously 
trashy film from director Tim Burton may be the ultimate "this-junk-will-
rot-your-brain" movie ever made. Go see it as quickly as possible.
Burton, who presented such quirky gems as "Pee-wee's Big Adventure", 
"Beetlejuice", and "Edward Scissorhands," as well as the first two 
"Batman" films, based "Mars Attacks!" on a series of trading cards issued 
by the Topps Company in 1962. The cards, which showed bug-eyed Martians 
invading Earth, were quickly pulled off the market due to outrage over 
the lurid images of violence, particularly a card depicting a Martian 
using a ray gun to disintegrate a dog. Burton acquired the rights to the 
card series and began work on turning the images into a movie. He boasted 
that "We developed the script painstakingly by taking the cards and 
throwing them on the ground, and picking the ones we liked."
His haphazard vision is brilliantly realized on screen, through rich 
cinematography, art direction built around primary colors, stunning 
computer animation, and a delightfully overwrought score by longtime 
collaborator Danny Elfman. This is great eye and ear candy. 
After a gorgeous opening sequence showing the Martian armada approaching 
Earth, Burton spends considerable time introducing the massive all-star 
cast, which includes Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce 
Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox,
 Rod Steiger, Paul Winfield, Lukas Haas, Jim Brown and Tom Jones. In 
classic disaster movie fashion, the characters are spread over several 
locations, primarily Washington DC, Las Vegas, and a small town in Kansas.
 The cast play their characters broadly, as human caricatures. Burton 
recognized that, had they played it straight, it would have been 
difficult for the audience to relax and enjoy the cartoonish murder and 
mayhem.
The real stars of the film are the Martians, and the fun kicks in when 
they finally arrive. President Nicholson informs the country that 
extraterrestrials are on their way in a hilariously vague and inept 
speech. The Martian's initial landing in Pahrump, Nevada turns violent 
over an apparent "cultural misunderstanding." Following hasty 
negotiations by the hapless President, the aliens land in Washington to 
address Congress. In short order, their deadly intentions become crystal 
clear and full scale planetary war begins.
Burton tries the patience of the audience with the lengthy set-up, but 
delivers a whopping pay-off. The Martian assault is thrilling, 
technically dazzling, and extremely funny. In scene after scene, Burton's 
wonderfully bizarre vision virtually leaps from the screen. The computer-
generated aliens are mesmerizing as they cackle with maniacal glee at 
humanity's attempts to make peace, then skitter around the planet, 
incinerating people with the coolest death rays I've ever seen. 
Highlights among the film's many striking images include the destruction 
of Las Vegas (incorporating the real implosion of the Landmark Hotel and 
Casino), Lisa Marie's unearthly gliding movements as an undercover 
Martian temptress, a flying saucer playing games with the Washington 
Monument, and a love scene between two victims of the Martians' twisted 
experiments. The latter will certainly go down as one of the strangest, 
and funniest, images in the history of film.
Burton succeeds in maintaining a consistently good-natured humorous tone. 
The film is an comedic homage to sci-fi and disaster films, not a satire. 
Even in the wonderfully cheesy closing scene, Burton resists the urge to 
smirk. His skilled hand also makes the many scenes of death and 
destruction easy to take. There is no malice in his vision, this is 
simply the work of a naughty little boy. 
Despite the very slow start, "Mars Attacks!" delivers the goods. Over the 
years, Tim Burton has presented many wonderfully peculiar moments in 
uneven films. "Mars Attacks!", in all of its gory, goofy splendor, is his 
best work yet. And trust me, your parents would be appalled.

If you're feeling the least bit cynical, then you may wish to skip
"Hardball." The film, about a troubled man who finds redemption by
coaching a group of little boys from the ghetto, bends over backwards to
touch your emotional buttons. In fact, something occurs late in the
movie that is so shamelessly manipulative that some viewers may deem it
patently offensive. Still, I found "Hardball" rewarding because, beneath
the sappy music and formulaic story, the core of the film rang true.
Keanu Reeves plays Conor O'Neill, a compulsive gambler $11,000 in debt
to a pair of angry bookies. He wanders from one Chicago neighborhood bar
to another, trying to avoid those to whom he owes money while searching
for someone to front him enough cash for the next bet. O'Neill is
utterly lost  the only solution he can see to the problems brought on
by his gambling is yet more gambling.
In interviews and at public appearances, Keanu Reeves is notorious for
stammering and looking ill at ease. As O'Neill, he takes that hesitancy
and discomfort and channels it into the character. His performance is
very effective, working against expectations for the leading man in a
feel-good movie. His O'Neill is not inherently noble; he finds
redemption only by stumbling into it.
The opportunity to live a life that extends beyond himself comes from an
acquaintance that offers O'Neill $500 a week to take over his position
as coach for the Kekambas, a Little League team from the projects. As
with most characters in this genre, he doesn't like working with kids
and has no interest in the job, but his desperation for cash forces him
to accept the deal.
Even more unsure of himself than usual, he meets the team. Thankfully,
the young actors playing the Kekambas come off not as stereotypes, but
simply as ordinary boys living in hellish surroundings. Particularly
memorable are Jefferson (Julian Griffith), a kid determined to work
around his asthma and extra pounds, Miles (Alan Ellis Jr.), who listens
to a tape of his favorite song in order to set his pitching rhythm, and
brothers Kofi (Michael Perkins) and G-Baby (DeWayne Warren), whose
devotion to one another is touching, but never overplayed.
In fact, nothing about the boys is overplayed. They are refreshingly
natural, making it even more painful to watch them navigate the grounds
of the projects like small soldiers looking for sanctuary on enemy turf.
They don't treat O'Neill as some great white savior, either. Rather,
they are simply glad to have an adult, any adult, willing to organize
safe activities for them.
Once the coach/team dynamics are established, the story follows the
obvious path, even providing a dedicated teacher (Diane Lane) to serve
as moral compass and potential love interest to O'Neill. Only the
verisimilitude of O'Neill and the boys keep the story from becoming
insufferable. And then comes the incident that really pushes the
envelope. I won't reveal it here  you'll have to decide whether it is a
fair representation of a tragic part of ghetto life, a cheap, cruel ploy
to wring tears from the audience at any cost, or both.
The credits for the film list it as being "inspired by" the book,
"Hardball: A Season in the Projects," by Daniel Coyle, which followed
the 1991 founding of a baseball league for kids in Chicago's infamous
Cabrini-Green housing project by two men: one black and one white. Bob
Muzikowski, a recovering addict turned Christian and Al Carter, a
government employee specializing in gang relations, spearheaded the
project, although they squabbled about virtually everything. Carter,
eager to celebrate the boys' racial heritage, grew increasingly
uncomfortable with middle-class white men coaching black children. In
1993, Muzikowski charged Carter with misappropriating funds from the
project, while Carter was busy forming another league.
Just a few days ago, a federal judge refused Muzikowski's request to
block the opening of "Hardball." Muzikowski is suing Paramount Pictures,
claiming that the O'Neill character defames him, and that the boys'
cursing in the movie is also defamatory, because such behavior is not
allowed by the league. At this point, the judge is siding with
Paramount's contention that the film is clearly identified as fiction
and protected by the First Amendment.
Indeed, "Hardball" is clearly fiction, and pretty cheesy fiction at
that. But, thanks to the performances of Reeves and the boys, and the
stark depiction of life in the projects, there is enough substance in
the movie to warrant a viewing. As I write these words on my laptop
computer in my cozy middle-class living room, precious human beings
continue their struggle to survive in the projects. Any film that
reminds us of such inequities deserves to be shown.

Actor turned writer/director Peter Berg says his mantra during the making 
of "Very Bad Things" was "Death before boredom." It shows. Extremely 
gruesome and packed with violence, "Very Bad Things" is most certainly 
not boring. The film has a relentless forward thrust, an energy that 
keeps the proceedings as involving as they are bloody, until it runs out 
of gas near the end. The film has too much of a conscience to fully 
succeed as a black comedy and is too farcical to fully succeed as a 
straightforward horror film, but damn if it isn't perversely entertaining 
most of the way along. 
The Tarantino-influenced black comedy, about a bachelor party gone 
horribly wrong, desperately wants to be a boy's club version of "Heathers,
" but doesn't know how to get there. Berg hops all over the place, from 
humorous nihilism to blunt-edged social commentary. His finished product 
plays essentially as a messy curiosity, albeit a fascinating one. 
It begins with a trip to Las Vegas. Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) is days 
away from marrying Laura (Cameron Diaz), a young woman obsessed with 
creating the perfect wedding ceremony. Determined to satisfy his fiancée, 
he continues working on wedding arrangements by car phone, even as his 
buddies urge him to relax and enjoy the ride to Las Vegas for his 
bachelor party. 
Kyle's pal Robert (Christian Slater), a real estate agent and 
motivational book zealot, has assembled everything necessary for a night 
of gambling and debauchery; from liquor and cocaine to a beautiful hooker.
 Joining in the revelry is family-man Adam (Daniel Stern), his tightly-
wound brother, Michael (Jeremy Piven), and Charles (Leland Orser), an 
introspective cipher. 
Things go swimmingly until Michael, during an over-enthusiastic session 
of stand-up sex, accidentally impales the prostitute on a bathroom coat 
hook. The shaken men debate what to do, with Robert arguing for a quick 
disposal of the body in the desert. He dismisses all legal and moral 
issues, coolly stating "this is just a 105 pound problem that has to be 
moved from point A to point B." With strong reservations, the others 
agreed to the plan, only to have matters further complicated when a 
security guard arrives and spots the corpse. Ever the problem-solver, 
Robert uses a corkscrew on the guard, removing the witness and doubling 
the body count. 
The rest of the story follows the men on their damage control mission, 
with as many plot twists and turns as the aforementioned corkscrew. Each 
man reacts to the group decision in different ways, ranging from crushing 
guilt to gallows humor. Meanwhile, Laura continues her steamroller 
preparations for a wedding that will happen, no matter what.
With an actor at the helm, it's not surprising that the impressive cast 
of "Very Bad Things" is given considerable room to stretch. Christian 
Slater and Cameron Diaz have the juiciest parts, with Slater entertaining 
as a character who is essentially an older version of the sociopath he 
played in "Heathers." Diaz is a hoot as the marriage-at-all-costs bride 
to be. Her steely determination reminded me of Debbie Reynolds' ceremony-
fixated character from "In and Out," only much more ruthless.
Jeremy Piven is excellent as Michael, imbuing him with a great manic 
energy. The character is an explosion waiting to happen and Piven, known 
for his intense portrayals, perfectly captures Michael's hair-trigger 
emotions. Daniel Stern is less successful as Michael's brother, Adam, 
delivering a performance as a borderline hysteric that rarely varies in 
tone (incidentally, with all due respect to the intricacies of genetic 
coding, there is no way in hell those two guys could be brothers). As 
Charles, the sketchiest of the men, Leland Orser projects a jittery 
quality that keeps his character interesting. 
Which brings us to the groom. Jon Favreau, who scored a hat trick with 
"Swingers," is an extremely appealing actor, but oddly bland here. Kyle 
would have been more effective had Favreau cut back on the mealy-mouth 
squishiness and given the guy a little more oomph. Of course, all of the 
actors faced a challenge with their roles. After all, how do you play 
characters who are supposed to be tragic, despicable and funny all at the 
same time?
There are some big laughs in "Very Bad Things," although not as many as 
there could have been. Berg can't decide whether he's making a full-out 
tasteless farce or a noirish horror story involving real feelings, and 
refuses to commit to either. The potential impact is muted by the film's 
constant shifts in tone. One moment we're watching a character break down 
in heartfelt grief and shame over his actions, the next moment we're 
listening to one-liners about dismembered bodies. Berg punches so many 
contrasting emotional buttons that the whole system finally short 
circuits. The film's closing shot, intended to either provoke reflection 
or provide one last sick laugh, drew no response whatsoever from me. By 
that point, I just wanted to go home.

"I can do anything I want just as long as I don't care about the results.
" That is the declaration of freedom, or admission of defeat, made by 20 
year old Jeff as he stands in the parking lot outside a convenience store.
 Jeff, played by Giovanni Ribisi (Phoebe's brother on "Friends",) is the 
intellectual member of a group of young people who do nothing in 
particular for two hours in "subUrbia", the latest film from Richard 
Linklater ("Slacker," "Dazed And Confused," "Before Sunrise".) Working 
from a screenplay by Eric Bogosian ("Talk Radio") based on his off-
Broadway play, "subUrbia" is a film both repellent and fascinating. The 
movie is a detailed portrait of emptiness; a character study of people 
with little character. SubUrbia reeks of hopelessness and wasted lives, 
yet it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen. You care about these 
people, even if they don't.
Eric Bogosian is renown for bombastic, talky scripts filled with anger 
and self-righteousness and subUrbia is no exception. Boy, do these guys 
talk! Every night they gather outside the Circle A (just like the symbol 
for anarchy  that Bogosian is so clever) convenience store, drinking, 
squabbling, spouting existential gibberish and trying the patience of 
Nazeer (Ajay Naidu) and Pakeesa (Samia Shoaib,) the Pakistani couple who 
manage the store. Nazeer, an engineering student working hard to achieve 
the American dream, is the moral guardian of the story as he repeatedly 
confronts the listless group and challenges their nihilistic lifestyles. 
"You people are so stupid," he shouts in utter exasperation, "You throw 
everything away." In return, he receives threats and racist insults from 
surly drunk Tim (Nicky Katt,) who proclaims "I'm an American. I'm owed 
something."
SubUrbia takes place over the course of one night outside the Circle A. 
The usual group is there. Jeff, seeker of truth who lives in a pup tent 
in his parent's garage; Tim, a Fonzie type who sliced off the tip of his 
finger to get out of the military, and Buff (Steve Zahn, the blonde from 
"That Thing You Do") a loud, stupid party-type who is prone to sudden 
moves of manic energy. On this night, the group is waiting for the 
arrival of Pony (Jayce Bartok,) an old pal whose rock band has became an 
MTV flavor of the day. The boys are joined by Sooze (Amie Carey,) 
performance artist wanna-be and Jeff's girlfriend, and Bee-Bee (Dina 
Spybey,) Sooze's deeply depressed, fresh-out-of-rehab pal.  
Pony shows up in a limo, along with his personal assistant Erica (Parker 
Posey,) and a night of drinking, talking, sex, talking, eating, talking, 
wacky hijinks, talking, violence and talking begins. There is action of 
sorts. Several of the group go for a limo ride. There's a walk in the 
woods and some sexual activity in a van, but mostly everyone just keeps 
jabbering. Oddly enough, the film only feels real during the long 
stretches of endless chatter. The action scenes feel inserted, mostly 
because it's hard to imagine these people actually doing anything. 
Towards the end of the film, Bogosian throws in a couple of incidents to 
bring the movie to a climax. Even these trumped up moments of drama 
become anti-climatic, just like the lives of these characters.
So why am I giving this film a qualified recommendation? Partly because 
of the acting. Giovanni Ribisi is compelling as the self-important, 
pontificating Jeff. As tiresome as his monologues become, Ribisi does a 
fine job of portraying the pain behind them. Jeff is annoying as hell, 
but you care about the guy. Parker Posey is a breath of fresh air as 
Pony's personal assistant; her optimism, tempered though it may be, 
provides a much-needed counterpoint to the cynicism of the others. 
Finally, Ajay Naidu has a commanding presence as the manager of the 
Circle A. His moral outrage, coupled with the frustration of being an 
eternal outsider, is both palpable and important. He voices the scorn 
that most viewers will feel watching these young people wasting the 
precious gift of life.
"SubUrbia" is a frustrating film. Bogosian's script is filled with 
contempt for its characters, while Linklater's direction shows clear 
affection for the same people. Perhaps that's why the movie is so 
fascinating. We all know people like those showcased in "subUrbia". They 
may drive us crazy, but they still matter. Maybe that's all "subUrbia" 
has to say and maybe that's all it needs to say.

Jackie Chan is one of the biggest movie stars on Earth, except in the 
United States, where he has only a fiercely devoted cult following. 
Determined to achieve the mass-market success that offerings like "Rumble 
in the Bronx" and "Mr. Nice Guy" failed to provide, the 44-year-old Hong 
Kong native put himself completely in the hands of Hollywood for his 
latest shot at becoming an American superstar. "It's not for the money. 
It's for the face," he said in an Associated Press interview. "You know 
Chinese, always face." 
His current efforts to save face include fighting less and allowing 
himself to be plugged into the formulaic mismatched-cop action/comedy 
"Rush Hour." "Now, if it doesn't work," said Chan, "that means American 
audience do not accept my kind of action, or my kind of personality, or 
me." 
Luckily for Chan, it works. "Rush Hour" is a lot of fun, thanks to flashy 
action scenes, sharp one-liners and the chemistry between Chan and 
motormouth comedian Chris Tucker. Sure, it's just another cookie-cutter 
cop flick, but this particular cookie tastes pretty good.
Like "Lethal Weapon 4," "Rush Hour" uses the cop movie format merely as 
an excuse to showcase its stars and pyrotechnics. "Every so often we have 
to let the general public know that we can still blow shit up," says one 
cop, perfectly voicing the mind-set of most Hollywood producers. Unlike 
"Lethal Weapon 4," "Rush Hour" has a plot which, while not particularly 
original, is at least coherent. 
The story begins on the eve of the historic 1997 transfer of Hong Kong 
back to the Chinese (it's a miracle the filmmakers didn't trip over the 
electrical cables of other movie crews, since both "Knock Off" and "The 
Chinese Box" are also set in the same city on the same day). Detective 
Inspector Lee (Chan) raids the lair of a legendary crime lord, recovering 
a huge cache of stolen artwork.
Cut to Los Angeles, where LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker) annoys 
every officer within a ten mile radius with his reckless techniques and 
non-stop babbling. When the Chinese consul flies in Lee to assist in the 
search for his kidnapped daughter, the FBI asks the LAPD to provide a cop 
to ''baby-sit'' Lee so that he doesn't hinder their investigation. 
Carter's chief happily assigns him to the task and, quicker than you can 
say "movie cliché," a maverick mismatched cop team is born.
But it works, because Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan really click together. 
Tucker slightly tones down his hyperactive, helium-voiced, in-your-face 
chatter, making his character humorously abrasive rather than 
insufferable. He's actually quite fun to watch as he talks his way in and 
out of trouble, periodically breaking into a bizarre urban-Egyptian form 
of dance and using leering effeminate movements to challenge other males. 
I have no idea how Tucker developed his alien-on-amphetamines shtick, but 
he's certainly one of a kind.
The wonderful Jackie Chan, a martial arts hybrid of Buster Keaton and 
Gene Kelly, is the absolute master of ingenious escapes, and he displays 
some of his remarkably adroit artistry here, scrambling up walls and 
trees, skittering across a very high beam, disarming bad guys and 
tumbling from great heights in dazzling style. He has less stunts than 
usual, but remains a wonder to behold. As always, his physical gifts are 
complimented by his comedic skills and geniality. Chan is one of the most 
likable performers in the business and it's a pleasure spending time with 
him.  
Together, Chan and Tucker are an appealing sweet and sour team, with 
their contrasting personalities providing a lot of laughs, even as 
culture clash jokes fly fast and loose in all directions. Personally, I 
found a number of Carter's Asian one-liners to be borderline racist, but 
if Jackie Chan didn't find the jokes offensive, I suppose I can be a good 
sport about it as well.
With its tired premise, superfluous supporting cast, cheesy dramatic 
moments and painfully obvious plot twists, "Rush Hour" should have been 
just another buddy cop throwaway, but instead the film is light, fast, 
breezy fun. It just goes to show that the right stars can make even the 
most pedestrian material shine. If this film doesn't finally make Jackie 
Chan a major star in the United States, blame the American public, 
because Chan is certainly delivering the goods.

Title
Review for Fierce Creatures (1997)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
"Fierce Creatures," which reunites John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin 
Kline and Michael Palin from "A Fish Called Wanda," is a pleasant, funny 
little film. It's not anywhere near as good as "Wanda," which is a shame, 
but even a half-baked offering from this cast is much more entertaining 
than what usually passes for comedy.
Kline plays Rod McCain, a blustering Rupert Murdoch-like billionaire 
mogul who buys and sells just for the power rush. Management of one of 
his recent acquisitions, a British zoo, is delegated to Rollo Lee 
(Cleese), whose duty is to wring a 20% profit from the place, or else. 
Lee, operating on the theory that violence is the only thing that sells, 
declares that the zoo must be purged of all but the dangerous animals, 
hence the "fierce creatures" of the title. His efforts are complicated by 
the arrival of two Americans; newly hired marketing expert Willa Weston 
(Curtis) and McCain's loutish son Vince (Kline again,) who aspires to 
transform the zoo into a corporate and celebrity sponsored theme park. 
Palin plays one of the outraged zoo employees, a obsessive walking 
encyclopedia who never shuts his mouth.
The multi-layered story line is promising, and delivers some juicy 
moments. The zoo keepers try to save their furry friends by convincing 
Lee that their animals are dangerous, leading to some very creative lying.
 One staff member gestures towards a group of meek animals and exclaims 
"the meercat is known as the piranha of the desert. It can strip a corpse 
clean in three minutes!" Moments later, another zoo keeper staggers by, 
wearing a fake bloody eye patch and crying "It's the sea lion, sir!" 
Despite the many juicy moments in "Fierce Creatures," the film has an 
uneven and occassionally forced feel. This isn't surprising, as the 
production endured a reworked script, two directors, and several reshot 
scenes. In "A Fish Called Wanda," the story and the character development 
flowed smoothly. Things are more herky-jerky in this film.
Michael Palin is essentially wasted as the talky zoo-keeper. His 
character is wafer-thin  he exists only to annoy. Palin often did this 
sort of thing in Monty Python skits, but those sketches were just a few 
minutes long. Why a performer of his caliber chose to play a one-note bit 
part is mystifying.  
Jamie Lee Curtis fares better. Her character, an extremely bright 
corporate climber, has an abrupt change in personality mid way into the 
movie, going from ruthless to sweet in seconds. It's an awkward change, 
but Curtis handles it well. Despite the frantic goings-on, she radiates 
an air of confidence and serenity. The combination of intelligence, drop 
dead good looks and that wicked twinkle in her eye make Curtis a 
compelling screen presence.  
In his dual roles as father and son, Kevin Kline is clearly having a 
whale of a good time. As the tyrant Rod McCain, Kline is suitably pompous 
and self-absorbed, punctuating his statements with belches and flatulence.
 The character is appropriately overbearing, but lacks flair. However, 
Kline's turn as Vince, McCain's whacked-out son, is much more rewarding. 
Kline struts, preens, and lurches as Vince pursues his idiotic schemes. 
While his performance fails to hit the manic peak he reached in "Wanda," 
his entertaining work here shows he hasn't lost his wonderful comic edge. 
The center of "Fierce Creatures" is, of course, the magnificent John 
Cleese. As Rollo Lee, he plays a variation of his classic Basil Fawlty 
character. Lee wants to be wicked, he tries to be wicked, but underneath 
it all he's a softy. Cleese sputters better than anybody, and he provides 
some of the film's biggest laughs. 
"Fierce Creatures" isn't a sequel to "A Fish Called Wanda," although, 
late in the film, there is a very funny one-word nod to the earlier movie.
 Because of the huge critical and financial success of "Wanda," it's easy 
to go into the theater with unreasonably high expectations. However, if 
you enter the theater with an open mind and just relax, you're in for 
some real fun. "Fierce Creatures" may lack bite, but it's still a bloody 
good time.

Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)

Advertisements for "U.S. Marshals" present the film as a sort-of sequel 
to "The Fugitive." Don't be fooled. "The Fugitive," while no masterpiece, 
was a taunt enough thriller, with a tight script and strong 
characterizations from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. "U.S. Marshals,
" on the other hand, is just another slam-bang chase movie, with lots of 
flashy action set pieces strung together with a script direct from Cliché 
Central.
Tommy Lee Jones reprises his Oscar winning role as tough-as-nails, always-
gets-his-man Chief Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard. As in the first movie, 
Gerard and his plucky crew spend a couple of hours playing tag with an 
innocent man accused of murder. This time, former CIA operative Mark 
Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) is "It," racing about trying to prove that he 
was set up. Added to the mix is John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.,) a 
government agent assigned to "help" Gerard in his pursuit. That's about 
all there is to the plot. Basically, everyone chases each other from one 
action sequence to the next, while Jerry Goldsmith's yammering score 
underlines the tension we're supposed to feel. 
Tommy Lee Jones is a tremendous actor and Sam Gerard is a fascinating 
character, but "U.S. Marshal's" screenplay gives him nowhere to go 
dramatically and 133 tedious minutes to get there. In "The Fugitive," 
Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble, a doctor falsely convicted of murdering 
his wife, is thrown into a nightmarish situation and must rely on his 
wits to try and save himself. It's fascinating watching the interplay 
between Ford's desperate Everyman and Jones' relentless Gerard. 
Compare that to Snipes' bland character here. Mark Sheridan was a secret 
agent. Avoiding capture was part of his job description, for Christ's 
sake, which lets a lot of air out of the dramatic balloon. Snipes doesn't 
help matters much, giving a flat, mechanical performance without a hint 
of nuance. It's hard to feel empathy for Snipes and difficult to be 
engaged by the spectacle of two professionals chasing each other around 
the country.
John Pogue's anemic script tries to build up Gerard's character by 
reminding us again and again that we're watching one tough bastard who 
will stop at nothing to snag his quarry. "Looks like Sam has used up 
eight of his nine lives," offers one of his crew. "Your reputation has 
preceded you," a Federal agent admires. When asked "Is this guy crazy?" a 
teammate replies "No, but he's a carrier." 
Gerard appears quite comfortable with his newly bestowed superhero status.
 He struts around in front of dazzled locals, loudly exchanging strained 
banter with his rag-tag crew. In the first film, Gerard and company were 
a crack team. Here, they come off as smug and self-satisfied as the 
Ghostbusters in their prime. Of course, from the opening scene, which 
goes for an easy laugh by having Gerard race about in a chicken suit, 
it's obvious that Pogue has no intention of maintaining the character's 
integrity.
Women don't fare well in the film, either. Irene Jacob is wasted as 
Sheridan's vacuous girlfriend, serving no function other than to provide 
Starbucks with a whale of a product placement. Kate Nelligan pops in 
occassionally as Gerard's boss. It's obvious most of her scenes were left 
on the cutting room floor when she abruptly tells Gerard, "I love you, 
but that doesn't mean I won't fire you," leaving viewers to scratch their 
heads and go, "What? Who? Where?"
Structurally, the film is just a faded Xerox of "The Fugitive." Richard 
Kimble escaped from a spectacular train wreck. Mark Sheridan escapes from 
a spectacular plane crash (in a scene ripped off from "Con Air".) Kimble 
makes a spectacular leap off the edge of a dam. Sheridan makes a 
spectacular bungee leap off a building and onto a moving train. Sure, the 
crashes and stunts are nifty, but they aren't nifty enough to make up for 
cardboard characters and a plot straight out of "Rocky and Bullwinkle."
The film leaves more than a few nagging questions. Is there anyone in 
this story who isn't a master at picking locks? Are the filmmakers just 
fans of Buddy Guy's Legends nightclub and the Broadway hit "Rent," or did 
they have to pay for their product placements too? And most of all, why 
in the world does Gerard keep chasing Sheridan when he's clearly figured 
out that the guy has been framed? 
Maybe he suffered memory loss, a delayed reaction from becoming 
overheated spending all those hours in a chicken suit. Or maybe he's just 
preoccupied, wondering how anyone could take a character as distinctive 
as Sam Gerard and stick him in a movie as half-assed as "U.S. Marshals."

Did you ever hear the one about a young woman driving along an isolated 
stretch of road late one rainy night, unaware that a killer is hiding in 
the back seat of her car? "Urban Legend" begins with that old folk tale, 
adding a wry audio joke to the mix. As Natasha Gregson Wagner cruises 
along, oblivious to the ax-wielding loon right behind her, she pops a 
tape into the car's cassette player, and Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of 
the Heart" begins to play. The song's instrumental introduction comes to 
a close and the male back-up singer beings to croon "Turn around..." 
I'm giving "Urban Legend," the latest entry in the post-"Scream" slasher 
movie renaissance, a qualified recommendation based on a few self-mocking 
gags like that, and a nice starring turn by Alicia Witt, but mostly for 
the filmmaker's audacious choices concerning the identity and motif of 
their serial killer.  
Before exploring the juicy details about the murderer (have no fear, 
there will be no spoilers here), it's important to cover the basics of 
the story. Like virtually every slasher flick, "Urban Legend" involves a 
lunatic chasing attractive, mostly white, young people. The story is set 
at a picturesque New England college staffed by only three adults; a 
crusty disbelieving administrator (John Neville), a wise, but ominous 
professor (Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund) and a plucky security guard 
(Loretta Devine from "Waiting to Exhale"). In a recent interview, I asked 
Devine about the film's paucity of adults and she laughed and said "Shit, 
honey, kids don't want to look at grown-ups!"
There's a killer on campus, murdering students by recreating famous urban 
legends; those alligators-in-the-sewer, exploding-cats-in-the-microwave 
contemporary myths passed on by folks who invariably claim the stories 
really happened to a cousin of a friend of theirs.
Alicia Witt (the daughter from "Cybil") is the first to figure out the 
horrible pattern, but of course, no one will believe her. As the body 
count grows, the leaders of tomorrow cope with the carnage in the only 
logical fashion - - they throw a kegger party. Naturally, the killer 
attends and the corpses stack up, leading to the inevitable face-off 
between our heroine and the maniac.
Oh, and what a maniac! In a burst of idiotic inspiration, the filmmakers 
conceal the killer's identity by dressing the psychopath in (get ready 
for this) a parka with a fuzzy, face-obscuring hood that looks like it 
came straight out of "South Park." Instead of being frightening, I found 
myself fighting the urge to shout "Oh my God, Kenny's killing sophomores! 
You bastard!"
That's not all. When the killer is finally revealed, we're treated with 
an overacting exhibition of operatic proportions. Obviously, I can't 
mention the actor's name, so I'll simply offer my congratulations on a 
wild-eyed, teeth-gnashing, in-your-face performance that would make even 
William Shatner blush.
In the starring role, Alicia Witt deserves credit for centering the film 
by projecting an air of reason that makes all this nonsense seem almost 
credible. Even when her own behavior is illogical, there's a look of 
intelligence in her eyes that helps to sell the story. Look for Witt to 
go on to much better things.
"Urban Legend" ends with a patently unbelievable scene that sets thing up 
for a sequel. I hope they do one because, even with its many leaden spots,
 this lurid trifle is actually fun on a trashy level. Besides, there's so 
many urban legends left to cover. For instance, did you hear the one 
about a writer who turned out a screenplay for a teen movie that didn't 
insult the viewer's intelligence? It's true. It was written by the cousin 
of a friend of mine.

I've assigned no star rating to John Travolta's "Battlefield Earth"
because, frankly, I'm unsure how many stars to give a film that is so
bad that it's good. In general, I find the practice of championing lousy
movies to be distasteful. Mocking the efforts of others is snide, and
besides, there are plenty of quality films dying on the vine for lack of
a receptive audience.
Every so often a movie comes along that is so overwrought, overacted and
overwhelmingly inept that it must be seen to be believed. Glorious
disasters like "Valley of the Dolls," "Mommie Dearest," "Road House" and
"Showgirls." And now comes "Battlefield Earth," the newest entry to the
Grade Z Hall of Fame.
Travolta optioned the source novel in 1983, and has been trying to get
the 1000 page opus by his mentor, L. Ron Hubbard, onto the big screen
ever since. Originally, he dreamed of starring as the young hero, but as
the years passed and his waistline thickened, Travolta (who also
co-produced the film) opted to play the villain instead.
The story is set in the year 3000; nearly a millennium after the
Psychlos, a supremely arrogant alien race, wiped out most of humanity.
As security chief Terl (Travolta) graciously explains, "When we attacked
your planet... all your soldiers and all their advanced technology, you
only put up a measly nine-minute fight. This is why Man is an endangered
species!" From domed installations, the Psychlos force the surviving
"man-animals" to mine for gold.
The remnants of our species are primitives, many of whom consider the
Psychlos to be vengeful gods. When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper,
the sharpshooter from "Saving Private Ryan") dares to leave his people
in the hills to go exploring, he is quickly captured by the aliens and
comes face to face with Mr. Psychlo himself. Terl, enraged after being
passed over for promotion, uses Jonnie as a pawn in an elaborate scheme
to regain the power he feels he deserves. But Jonnie has plans of his
own. Assembling a ragtag (is there any other kind?) team of patriots, he
intends to drive the Psychlos off the planet, by any means necessary.
The plot is serviceable; it's the execution that makes "Battlefield
Earth" such a joke. The filmmakers are so determined to make viewers
realize they are watching an !!EPIC!! that they turn the production into
a gigantic block of cheese.
>From the opening scenes, which employ a "Beastmaster" motif, Elia
Cmiral's "majestic" score bludgeons the audience with thunderous noise.
If one of the noble human savages even raises an arm, you can count on a
pounding kettledrum or a fanfare to accompany the movement.
The acting matches the music. Barry Pepper adopts a stilted Mid Atlantic
accent, the kind community theater actors use when they play royalty.
Sincere to a fault, his strained delivery suggests constipation rather
than heroism. Perhaps the strain was from trying to keep a straight face
while spouting lines like "We're gonna destroy their home world of
course, we'll need some extra supplies for that."
Pepper is a master of subtlety compared to Travolta, who gives a
performance that would make William Shatner wince. Decked out like the
bastard son of a Klingon and Gene Simmons, the dreadlocked Travolta
crinkles his fingers while hissing, snarling and overenunciating
absurdly, punctuating sentences like "Once we finish mining-out this
miserable little planet, let's do the Universe a favor: Let's
exterminate the life from it!" with maniacal laughter. He also swears a
lot, mostly using peculiar variants of the word "crap."
The Psychlos are supposed to be overconfident fools who fatally
underestimate humanity ("A man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo,"
cackles Terl, "that'll be the day!"), and Travolta gets that part right.
But they're also supposed to be frightening, and these boobs in KISS
boots are anything but. As Terl's underling, Ker, Forest Whitaker
(looking extremely uncomfortable in freaky contact lens) is a bit less
embarrassing than Travolta, though he has his share of cringe-worthy
moments. Kelly Preston, Mrs. Travolta, also appears briefly, just long
enough to lasciviously waggle her mega-long CGI tongue.
As for the mechanics of the "man-animal" revolt, suffice to say the plot
has more holes than a tattooist's ears. Oh sure, the Psychlos took Earth
in nine minutes, but the savages have an edge because, hey, they're
spunky. Luckily for them, aircraft that has sat untouched for nearly a
thousand years still works. And if you thought the resolution of
"Independence Day" was ridiculous, wait until you get a load of the
finale here.
Visually, the film is a muddy pastiche of images and set pieces from
other sci-fi films, ripping off everything from "Planet of the Apes" to
"The Matrix." Adding to the absurdity is Director Roger Christian's
attempt to weird things up by repeatedly shooting scenes at an angle, ŕ
la "The Twilight Zone."
If you think this all sounds horrific, trust me  I've barely scraped
the surface. "Battlefield Earth" is an absolute disaster and a crapload
of campy fun. The icing on the cheesecake is Travolta's assurance that
there will positively be a sequel. Jeepers, I can hardly wait!

Review for Krippendorf's Tribe (1998)
Krippendorf's Tribe (1998)
Richard Dreyfuss, Jenna Elfman, Lily Tomlin, Natasha Lyonne, Gregory 
Smith, Stephen Root, Elaine Stritch. Directed by Todd Holland.
PG-13, 2 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly

In the press kit for "Krippendorf's Tribe," director Todd Holland states 
"I was attracted to the sort of journey that this family goes through. 
It's a family story with a lot of heart. They lose the glue of their 
existence when the mother dies but then, through some quite ridiculous 
and desperate actions, they start to see each other again." Apparently 
Todd has been sniffing the glue of their existence. "Krippendorf's Tribe" 
is a loud, rowdy farce that's occassionally funny, but "a family story 
with a lot of heart?" Give me a break. 
The film begins as James Krippendorf (Richard Dreyfuss) looks at video 
footage of his late wife. He stares wistfully at the screen, drinking in 
the images of three happy kids cavorting with their parents, a mom and 
pop anthropology team, and members of a cheerful New Guinea tribe. Those 
days are gone. Deeply depressed following the death of his wife, 
Krippendorf has spent the last two years hanging around the house, living 
off a grant to study an "undiscovered" tribe in New Guinea. His alienated 
kids co-exist with him, glowering in varying degrees of hostility. Then, 
overbearing anthropologist Veronica Micelli ("Dharma and Greg's" Jenna 
Elfman) pops up to inform Krippendorf that he must deliver a lecture 
about the tribe that evening. A panicked Krippendorf bluffs his way 
through the lecture, answering questions about the non-existent 
Shelmikedmu tribe, (the name is cobbled together from Shelly, Mike, and 
Edmund, the names of his kids) while senior anthropologist Ruth Allen 
(Lily Tomlin) looks on with suspicion. The Shelmikedmu capture the 
imaginations of academia, and Krippendorf races off to create film 
footage of the tribe, using his family as bogus natives.
So where is our "family film with a lot of heart" at this point? 
Following the loss of their mother, the kids have lived in a trashy home 
for two years, watching their father lay on the couch, living off stolen 
money. Faced with the possibility of being caught, he bullies the kids 
into helping him create an elaborate series of lies to cover his crime. 
Gosh, I'm tearing up just thinking about this family film with a lot of 
heart, and we haven't even got to the parts about ritual circumcision, 
menstruation, flatulence, pig urine, and eating bugs yet. 
Oddly enough, the bodily function jokes are actually pretty entertaining, 
providing most of the occasional laughs in a movie that's far more 
frantic than funny. The creation and presentation of the "ritual tribal 
circumcision" footage provides some amusement. Later, young Mike apes his 
father's behavior at a school pageant, causing a riot when he explains 
how the Shelmikedmu "purify menstruating young virgins with pig urine," 
using a real classmate and a real pig for his demonstration. The scene is 
gross, but genuinely funny.
The same can't be said for most of the film. Despite loads of gross-out 
gags, "Krippendorf's Tribe" just isn't funny enough. The cast spends a 
great deal of time racing about frantically, providing far too few laughs 
for all the fuss. Todd Holland produced and directed many episodes of one 
of the funniest programs on television, "The Larry Sanders Show," but he 
doesn't handle this material with the same skill. The film suffers from a 
rushed feeling, with too many characters and too little character 
development. Lily Tomlin's Ruth Allen is an example of great potential 
that is wasted. The smug, self-righteous anthropologist hurries off to 
New Guinea to prove that the Shelmikedmu aren't real. Stomping through 
the jungle barking orders at her tribal guides, Ruth begins to come alive 
as a comic creation, but the scenes are merely used as quick-cut 
throwaways, never allowed a chance to fully blossom. That's typical of 
the film, as Holland takes a simple story concept and tries to jam way 
too much into it. 
Instead, we get an overdose of Jenna Elfman's terminally-perky Veronica. 
The in-your-face opportunist is overdone and annoying, becoming funny 
only when she's mad. After spotting herself in one of Krippendorf's bogus 
documentaries, demonstrating the "mating patterns of the Shelmikedmu," 
she becomes enraged, enacting revenge on Krippendorf during a moderately 
amusing talk show segment. Richard Dreyfuss, by the way, handles the 
central role with his usual staccato gusto. 
Ultimately, one wonders who "Krippendorf's Tribe" was made for. Adult 
audiences will have little patience for the large gaps between laughs. 
Family audiences are unlikely to appreciate a feel-good comedy where the 
hero gets a woman drunk, then films her having sex with him so he can 
show it on TV to bolster his massive fraud. But there is an upside. On 
the way home, Mom and Dad can spend quality time with the kids, answering 
all of their questions about circumcision and menstruation. Have fun, 
folks!

About mid-way through "Private Parts," radio bad boys Howard Stern and 
Fred Norris concoct a stunt to drive their program director crazy. 
Annoyed by the PD's edict that they perform wacky character bits instead 
of free-form chatter, the men agree to his demand with a vengeance. Using 
thick, lisping voices, they play an effeminate gay couple, gushing their 
love for one another. The scene climaxes, so to speak, with Stern 
pretending to gargle a cup of semen as a sign of his devotion, gurgling 
obscenely and popping off one-liners about swallowing. As a gay manhell, 
as an ADULT, I should have been offended watching these clowns reinforce 
negative gay stereotypes with their juvenile display. Instead, I couldn't 
stop laughing. Hunched over their microphones like co-conspirators, those 
two giggling overgrown schoolboys were delightfully naughty, not 
malicious. Oddly enough, the whole ludicrous scene was actually endearing.
The publicity campaign for "Private Parts" has been one of the most 
aggressive in recent memory. Beyond the barrage of promotional ads, Stern 
has appeared on every magazine cover, news program, and talk show in 
sight. If fact, I'm surprised he hasn't dropped by my apartment to offer 
suggestions on how to write this review. Over and over, Stern has 
hammered away at his message that "Private Parts" is more than just an 
outrageous comedy  it's also a sweet story of a misunderstood guy who is 
deeply devoted to his wife and family. 
He's more or less correct. The film is a entertaining, surprisingly 
traditional biopic; liberally peppered with Stern's gross-out humor. 
Based on his 1993 autobiography, Stern provides the voice-over as we 
watch sepia-tone images of his childhood in New York, with Dad calling 
little Howard an idiot. Stern's interest in radio leads him to Boston 
University, where he meets Alison (Mary McCormack of "Murder One"), the 
love of his life. Playing himself, in a hilarious variety of bad 
hairstyles, Stern pays his dues working as a floundering mainstream 
deejay in various radio stations, eventually landing a gig in Washington 
DC, where he, along with cohorts Norris and Robin Quivers, develops his 
shock jock on-air personality.
Director Betty Thomas ("The Brady Bunch Movie") handles the trio of radio 
performers well, placing them in familiar settings where their fledgling 
skills as actors are not overly taxed. Quivers, Stern's newscaster and 
straightman, handles her scenes well, but Fred Norris, Stern's engineer 
and cohort,  is the film's real surprise. His deadpan delivery ("Fred's 
like wallpaper," explains Stern), coupled with a naive sexiness, provides 
some big laughs. During a hotel room sequence with Stern and a B-movie 
starlet, Norris says little, but completely steals the scene in hilarious 
fashion.
Stern is at his best when in the studio or onstage, reenacting his bits 
with infectious glee. His acting ability is shakier during the much-
heralded tender moments, although McCormack's quietly assured performance 
is strong enough to carry the two of them. Early scenes of Stern as a 
geeky novice are ham-handed, to say the least. Still, the gags are good. 
One of the funniest shots is a visual; a close up of Stern's crotch as he 
clearly becomes aroused beneath his trousers. God help the special 
effects person assigned to produce that shot.
"Private Parts" includes moments of shocking tastelessness, particularly 
a sequence of Stern making jokes on the air about his wife's miscarriage. 
But the scene is quickly followed by a "heartfelt" apology from Stern, 
reinforcing the film's incessant portrayal of Stern as a man whose rude 
demeanor is just a cover for the lovable cuddle-bunny that lies inside. 
Stern likens his life story to "Rocky," seeing himself as a gangly 
outcast who succeeds against all the odds. That seems simplistic and a 
bit suspect. "Private Parts" plays like a well-done snow job; a candy 
coated valentine to an self-obsessed media hound. I doubt that Stern is 
the demon some paint him to be, but he's certainly not Mister Rogers 
either. Regardless of "Private Parts" self-serving design, the bottom 
line is that this rude, funny and sweet movie works. So Howard wins again.
 Geez, who'd have thought?

Remember the scene in "Jurassic Park" where a character avoids becoming 
human sushi by standing perfectly still, even as the massive head of a 
mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex looms mere inches from his own? In the Imax 
feature, "T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous," you get to be that character, 
with an incredibly realistic 3-D thunder lizard baring its teeth so close 
to your face that you can almost feel its hot breath on your cheeks.
"T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous," offers the most effective use of 3-D and 
the best special effects of any Imax production to date. For those who 
marvel at dinosaurs, this is an absolute must-see. That said, the 
production suffers from the same liabilities that have hobbled previous 
Imax 3-D offerings. Wafer-thin plotlines, underdeveloped characters and 
too many stodgy educational sequences are hallmarks of Imax movies, and 
the features still play more like engaging novelties than fully-
satisfying films. 
Going to an Imax movie is a lot like visiting any exhibit at Disney's 
Epcot theme park. In exchange for a few minutes of razzle-dazzle, you 
must submit to long stretches of scholastic force-feeding. Please 
understand, I'm all for learning, but at $8 for a 45-minute movie, the 
emphasis should firmly be on entertainment. In the case of "T-Rex," that 
translates into a strong craving for more dinosaurs and less paleontology.
Director Brett Leonard ("The Lawnmower Man," "Virtuosity") uses 
spectacular 3-D effects to inject as much excitement as possible into the 
tepid story of the strained relationship between obsessed paleontologist 
Donald Hayden (Peter Horton) and his neglected daughter, Ally 
(Indianapolis native Liz Stauber). During an early scene at an 
archeological dig, rock fragments fly straight into the face of the 
audience. The effect was so convincing that it sent a brave six-year-old 
sitting next to me diving under his seat for cover. 
Another shot of a woman dropping 35 feet down the side of a cliff also 
maximizes the 3-D effect. The cast worked without stunt doubles and actor 
Kari Coleman noted "All I could think about when we were doing that stunt 
fall was 'Boy, people will be sitting in an Imax theater seeing my rear 
end six stories high just coming at them in 3-D.'"
The big find from the dig is a fossil that may just be a Tyrannosaurus 
egg. That's the hope of young Ally, who wants to prove her theory that 
dinosaurs were the ancestors of today's birds. More importantly, the girl 
is sick of being left at the museum and dreams of the day when her 
preoccupied pop will finally give her the attention and respect she 
deserves.
After way too much filler, we finally get to the good stuff when Ally 
knocks the fossil to the floor and the object cracks, emitting a 
mysterious dust. Strange things begin to happen around Ally in the 
darkened museum. First, a T-Rex skeleton comes to life, turning to roar 
right into the camera. The magic continues as Ally wanders into various 
dinosaur exhibits, traveling through time to see the real thing.
Between visits with a couple of historical figures, the young woman 
encounters a number of dinosaurs, beautifully rendered in the most 
convincing computer graphics this side of Steven Spielberg. A Pteranodon 
swoops in front of our faces, impressively flapping its huge leathery 
wings. An Ornithomimus, looking like the mischievous kid brother of a 
raptor, snatches an egg from the nest of T-Rex, triggering an angry 
response from a protective T-Rex mama. The climax comes when a meteor 
screams down from the heavens, triggering the death knell of the giant 
lizards and the beginning of the Ice Age.
The 3-D dinosaur scenes are perfectly realized and incredibly cool. If 
only there were more of them. Sure, computer graphics are expensive, but 
the Imax folks can certainly afford the costs. Less educational 
exposition, a better storyline and more dinosaur scenes would have made 
"T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous" the event of the season. As is, the 
feature is still a hoot, but you'll likely find yourself fidgeting right 
along with the kids as you wait for the film to kick into high gear.

Review for Evening Star, The (1996)
The Evening Star (1996)
Shirley MacLaine, Bill Paxton, Juliette Lewis, Miranda Richardson, Ben 
Johnson, Scott Wolf, George Newbern, Marion Ross, Mackenzie Astin, Donald 
Moffat, China Kantner, Jack Nicholson, Jennifer Grant. Directed by Robert 
Harling. 129 minutes.
PG-13, 1 star (out of 5 stars)
I went into "The Evening Star", the sequel to "Terms Of Endearment", with 
an open mind. Really. I'd watched the 1983 original several times and 
enjoyed its rich, quirky characterizations and loping storyline. Heck, I 
even teared up at the appropriate moments. So I was in a receptive mood 
for another go around with Aurora Greenway and her dysfunctional family.
Over two hours later, I left the theater stunned. "The Evening Star" 
isn't simply a failed sequel. It's a veritable train wreck of a movie. 
Writers Larry McMurtry and Robert Harling (who also directed) are 
responsible for this mawkish, painfully slow, disaster. 
Here's the gory details. It's 1988 and Grandma Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) 
continues to fret over her late daughter's children. Remember Tommy, the 
oldest boy, who sulked through the last third of the original movie? Well,
 he's an adult now and he never stopped pouting. Aurora visits him 
regularly in prison, where he's serving his third stint for possession. 
She hands him brownies and clucks away until he sneers, tosses the 
brownies in the trash and stomps back to his cell. This scene is played 
out several times, for no apparent reason.
Back home, pleasant middle child Teddy lives with his girlfriend and has 
a cute kid who says "butthole" a lot. Since Teddy seems reasonably well-
adjusted, Aurora pays virtually no attention to him, focusing instead on 
little Mildred (Juliette Lewis), the film's ersatz Debra Winger. Millie 
divides her time between boffing her boyfriend (Scott Wolf as an aspiring 
underwear model) and screeching at Aurora on the many ways her life has 
been ruined by Granny's interference. As if this wasn't enough, longtime 
family friend Patsy (Miranda Richardson) hovers around the young woman 
constantly. Patsy never forgave Aurora for denying her custody of the 
kids, and spends most of the movie wreaking revenge. 
This muddled soap opera provides Shirley MacLaine ample opportunities to 
showcase Aurora's histrionics. In the original film, Aurora was a 
fascinating character; a loving, overbearing control freak engaged in an 
internal war between her basic romantic needs and her strong sense of 
propriety. Here, the character becomes a grotesque caricature of the 
original. When she's not sputtering venomous insults in all directions, 
she's engaged in set pieces straight out of second-rate situation 
comedies. One of the worst, a catfight with Patsy on an airplane, is as 
embarrassing as anything from the final season of "Roseanne."
Director Harling's attempts at emotional manipulation make the 
proceedings even more annoying. The leaden soundtrack tells you how to 
feel, with a whimsical refrain for every comedic scene and dripping 
strings for the "heartfelt" moments. He constantly surrounds Aurora with 
an indulgent audience, housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross) and several ex-
suitors, who appear to exist solely to dote on her. Harling punctuates 
the screeching and slapstick by killing off a character every 30 minutes 
or so. Three seniors bite the dust by the film's end - - this movie has 
more death scenes than "Platoon." 
Along the way, Aurora fights depression and searches for a sense of 
meaning to her life, which leads her into the arms of a slimy young 
counselor with a mother complex, played horribly by Bill Paxton. The 
utter lack of chemistry between the two is astounding.
An hour and forty five minutes into the film, Jack Nicholson finally 
makes his appearancefor about six minutes. Their too-brief reunion 
provides a few moments of awkward charm. 
"The Evening Star" has a some touching moments. When you throw this much 
pathos on the screen, a little of it is bound to stick. At one of the 
many funerals, Millie, who was an infant when her mother died, asks 
brother Teddy what it felt like to have a family. Their exchange is 
simple and moving. A bonding scene between Aurora and Tommy also works, 
largely because both of them keep their mouths shut.
"The Evening Star" trivializes the rich characters from "Terms Of 
Endearment." If you enjoyed the original, watch it again and avoid this 
travesty at all costs.

The best thing I can say about "Jerry Springer: Ringmaster" is this: It's 
not as bad as it sounds. Thankfully, the story spends relatively little 
time with the slimy Mr. Springer, focusing instead on the comically lurid 
stories of two groups of people who end up as guests on his daytime trash-
talk show. Unfortunately, Springer is the star of the movie, so viewers 
are subjected to shots of a shirtless Jerry flexing his (ahem) muscles in 
front of a mirror, Jerry having sex (under the covers, thank God), Jerry 
half-singing a country tune in a honky-tonk bar, and Jerry delivering one 
of the most phony, self-serving speeches in the history of B-movies. 
While making the rounds promoting his show, his book and this film, 
Springer's defensive strategy has been to beat potentially hostile 
journalists to the punch. "Of course I have no talent," he says with a 
hapless puppy-dog smile. He freely admits that his show is nothing but a 
circus, telling an Entertainment Weekly reporter "Look, if I'm Satan, 
then we're all okay - - because then Satan ain't that bad." 
Springer isn't Satan. He's just another sorry huckster, shamelessly 
exploiting poor, undereducated people. It's easy to sneer at Springer's 
guests, but who is worse; those willing to sacrifice their privacy and 
dignity in exchange for a free trip to the big city and a few minutes in 
front of a camera or the guy who pays for their tickets?  
People who watch Springer regularly will be happy to hear that the movie 
captures the bizarro spirit of his "Too Hot For TV" videos, with fightin',
 cussin' and bare breasts galore, plus a few sex scenes to boot. Those 
dragged to the movie will be relieved to know that it's surprisingly 
entertaining on a "guilty pleasure" level.
"Ringmaster" takes a farcical look at two dysfunctional couples and their 
friends. Connie (Molly Hagan) works in a Florida donut shop. She suspects 
that while she's away, her current husband Rusty (Michael Dudikoff) and 
her 19 year old daughter Angel (Jaime Pressly) are having an affair. 
She's right. When not boinking her naďve, dim-witted fiancée, Willie 
(Ashley Holbrook), and the male guests of the motel where she works as a 
maid, Angel indeed is sleeping with her stepdaddy. When Connie catches 
Rusty and Angel, she does what any self-respecting mother would do: she 
seduces Willie to get even, hollers at her husband and daughter, then 
snags a booking for the whole group on Jerry's show. 
Meanwhile, Starletta (Wendy Raquel Robinson) is livid. Her boyfriend 
Demond (Michael Jai White) is having an affair with her best friend, 
Vonda (Tangie Ambrose), not long after she caught him with Leshawnette 
(Nicki Micheaux), another gal-pal. Again, using that special wisdom that 
comes only to people who believe professional wrestling is real, she 
decides the best way to handle the situation is to go on Jerry's show and 
confront the wrongdoers on national television. 
Once in L.A. for the show, all the characters meet up in a hotel the 
night prior to taping, with predictably lusty and combative results. The 
next day, they go to the studio for their fateful encounter with the 
geekmaster and all hell breaks loose, even before the inevitable on-air 
fistfights. 
It's all plays like a sprawling, unusually spirited episode of "Three's 
Company," except these people actually get laid. While most of the cast 
are just strident stereotypes, a few manage to humanize their characters, 
with Molly Hagan a stand-out as competitive mother Connie. She invests 
the character with a survivor quality that makes her manic behavior 
almost understandable.  
The most annoying moment in the film comes when an audience member 
verbally attacks the guests for degrading themselves and Springer jumps 
to their defense, making an impassioned, pathetic speech about the show 
being a forum for the "little people," allowing them the same moment in 
the sun that rich celebrities enjoy everyday. His righteous tirade is so 
irritating that it made me wish I could slip past his bodyguards and take 
a poke at the pompous ass myself.
Don't pay to see "Ringmaster." Sure, it has more than its share of fun 
moments, but wait until the movie hits cable, because every ticket you 
buy puts a little more money in the pants' pocket of Jerry Springer. And 
you really don't want anything of yours to end up in Jerry Springer's 
pants, do you?

Every since "Animal House," almost every comedy set in a college features 
some John Belushi wannabe doing his best Bluto impression and failing 
miserably. They fail because it's impossible to capture the magic of the 
late comedian simply by mimicking his character's behavior. There was a 
special glint in Belushi's eyes, a distinctive quality in the timbre of 
his voice and a sense of danger in his every movement that enabled him to 
take the stock character of a frat-house wild man and elevate it into 
something classic. 
While Bluto's spot in the College Comedy Hall of Fame remains secure, 
it's time to make room for the new maniac in town. As Cliff, a hyper-
enthusiastic, frenzied psychopath just waiting to be diagnosed, Lochlyn 
Munro is scary, mesmerizing and flat-out hilarious. His performance alone 
is worth the price of admission to "Dead Man on Campus."    
Please don't mistake the raves for Munro's tour de force as an 
unqualified endorsement of the movie. While "Dead Man on Campus" has a 
number of funny scenes, it really only hits the bull's eye when Cliff is 
on screen. In between his relatively brief appearances, you'll spend a 
fair amount of time waiting for the film to stop spinning its wheels and 
to get moving. 
The premise for "Dead Man on Campus" springs from the urban legend that 
if a student kills himself during a semester, his surviving roommates 
will automatically receive straight-A's as compensation for their grief 
and trauma. When a pair of mismatched roomies realize their grades are 
beyond redemption, they hatch a desperate scheme to cash in on the "dead 
man's clause" by finding a suicidal roommate and doing what they can to 
push him over the edge.
Thomas Everett Scott ("That Thing You Do") plays Josh, a wholesome 
Indiana boy attending prestigious Daleman College on an academic 
scholarship. His devotion to scholastic excellence falters under the 
influence of new roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar from "Saved By the 
Bell"), a wealthy kid majoring in sex, drugs and rock and roll. 
The two work well together. Scott is an engaging actor and his 
introduction to the party life provides some smiles, particularly when he 
blissfully recounts his first sexual experience ("We just...did it! It 
was like 'Time for sex!'"). Playing a self-absorbed ladies-man, Gosselaar 
is appropriately smarmy, and there's a certain perverse pleasure watching 
"Saved By the Bell's" Zack holding a stethoscope inside his pants and 
happily announcing "I can hear my heartbeat through my penis!"
Still, the first half of the comedy is relatively slow going, until the 
boys finally reach a crisis point and begin their search for a suicidal 
roomie. They come up with three candidates. Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) is 
a frail, skittish paranoid who often threatens suicide while ranting 
about an elaborate conspiracy involving Kurt Cobain and Vince Foster 
(they're still alive, sequestered near Mount St. Helens) and Bill Gates, 
who is after Buckley's brain.
Basket-case number two is Matt (Corey Page), a glowering goth-rocker with 
a thick British accent who handily incorporates his suicide threats into 
his song lyrics. 
And then there's Cliff, a psycho for all seasons. Leaping about the room, 
periodically humping the couch like some crazed dog in heat, Lochlyn 
Munro totally throws himself into character. He was so convincing in his 
audition that director Alan Cohn initially resisted hiring him, fearful 
that maybe it wasn't just an act. 
Munro manages to make the insanely over-the-top character endearing 
rather than grating. When he accidentally sets a coed's hair on fire 
during a party, he has to be stopped from unzipping to put out the flames 
using his personal fire hose. Watching the young woman panic, he 
innocently states "I don't get it. Whenever I'm on fire, I remember to 
drop and roll." Cliff's coarse antics are completely tasteless and 
howlingly funny. Incidentally, stay through the closing credits or you'll 
miss a bonus Cliff moment.
If only the rest of the film could maintain the energy and crudeness of 
the Cliff scenes. The biggest problem with the bulk of "Dead Man on 
Campus" is that it's too damn tasteful. First-time feature director Cohn 
pulls his punches, tempering potentially riotous scenes with a peculiar 
restraint. Just weeks after the remarkably successful release of the 
gross-a-thon "There's Something About Mary," this is certainly the wrong 
time for timidity. And after all, this is a comedy about students trying 
to drive a person to his death, for Pete's Sake. Cohn flirts with genuine 
black comedy and occasionally scores, but too frequently constructs 
scenes that play like a UPN sitcom with extra swearing. 
Thank goodness Lochlyn Munro's Cliff was there to drag this movie back to 
the gutter where it belongs. It's easy to imagine John Belushi looking 
down from the heavens, nodding his approval. A successor to the throne 
has at long last arrived and the spirit of Bluto lives on.

Review for Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
Late in "Everyone Says I Love You," Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn, playing 
a divorced couple, slip out of a benefit in Paris and go for a walk. 
After a bit, they sit and chat about the times they've had, about love, 
about relationships. They exchange a gentle, platonic kiss and then, on 
the banks of the river Seine, they dance. As the moonlight reflects off 
the water they dance gaily and, quite casually, Goldie Hawn's feet leave 
the ground. She slides, spins and glides ever so smoothly through the air,
 comfortably, as if she's done it all of her life. Hawn glows as she 
dances in air, so alive that even the law of gravity steps aside for a 
few moments. That elegant, utterly transcendent scene is one of the most 
wonderful things I've ever witnessed in a movie.
"Everyone Says I Love You" is Woody Allen's 26th film and his first 
musical. I've avoided Allen's work for some time. That business with his 
step-daughter was really disturbing, to be sure, but mostly I had just 
grown quite tired of his neurotic shtick and tedious repetition of 
ponderous existential questions. 
Things are quite different in this film, though. "Everyone Says I Love 
You" radiates with an effervescent innocence, with romance and hope. 
Creating a musical appears to have lightened Allen to the point where he 
uses song and dance to undermine his own bleak outlook. In one scene, 
Alan Alda, while seated at his father's funeral, tells the family that he 
never believed in God. "Even if God did exist," Alda's character quips, 
"He did such a terrible job that it's a wonder everyone doesn't file a 
giant class action suit against him." In most Woody Allen films, a line 
like that would be allowed to stand alone, or even worse, lead into a 
philosophical discussion on hopelessness. Not this time, though. Seconds 
after he speaks, the ghost of his father climbs right out of his coffin. 
While Alda and his family stare in astonishment, Grandpa starts singing 
"Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)." The ghosts of other funeral 
home corpses join him for in a conga line, dancing and cartwheeling away 
any notion that death is the end.
"Everyone Says I Love You" is filled with moments like that. Even the 
musical form itself is treated as something quite common, as if everyone 
breaks into song and dance from time to time. The conceit is underlined 
by the way the songs are handled. Everyone sings, regardless of whether 
or not they have a trained voice. The combination of lush orchestration 
and ordinary voices has a peculiar charm. The dance numbers also have a 
captivating, haphazard feel. Although wonderfully choreographed, the 
dancers look as if they could stumble at any moment. It all adds up to 
musical numbers that actually feel spontaneous.
Of course, there has to be a story around all those songs, and Allen has 
assembled an impressive cast to tell it. He plays a writer living in 
quasi-exile in Paris, although he remains close friends with his 
painfully liberal ex-wife (Hawn) and her husband (Alda.) Numerous sub-
plots spin involving everyone's kids, including a sweet romance between 
Drew Barrymore and Edward Norton that is interrupted when Barrymore 
becomes smitten with a hardened ex-con (Tim Roth.) Romance returns to 
Allen's life when his daughter D.J. (Natasha Lyonne) matches him up with 
the lovely Von (Julia Roberts). Seems D.J. has been spying on Von's 
counseling sessions and knows her deepest desires and fantasies. She 
feeds the information to Dad, who unethically uses the knowledge to 
become Von's dream date. 
On paper, the plot seems quite complicated, but things flow very smoothly 
on the screen. The multiple storylines really don't matter anyway. Magic 
and happy endings are what the film is about. Allen uses gorgeous 
locations, beautiful photography and the musical numbers to create a 
romantic world where hope reigns supreme and love conquers all. Who would 
have thought the King of misery could have created so much happiness?

"The Green Mile" is a good movie. At times, it is very good. But it's
not a great movie. I say this up front to try and balance out some of
the grandiose hype generated by the studio's publicity machine. For
months, "The Green Mile" has been touted as the most likely film to
sweep next year's Academy Awards. Last weekend, pre-release ads in
Sunday papers across the country upped the ante, with Paul Wunder,
Patty Spitler, Susan Granger and other notorious quote whores calling
the movie "the most extraordinary entertainment event of the year,"
"the best film of 1999," and "a masterpiece."
Were I cranking out a blurb for the movie, it would simply read
"'E.T.' on Death Row." Not that there's anything wrong with
that. Overall, director Frank Darabont ("The Shawshank Redemption")
does a fine job translating Stephen King's bestseller to screen,
although he focuses so much on whimsy and magic that the horrific
execution scenes almost seem out of place, which is pretty odd for a
story named after the green tile walkway leading to the electric
chair.
The bulk of the film takes place in 1935, centering on Paul Edgecombe
(Tom Hanks), a guard on a Louisiana death row cell block who spends a
lot of time grimacing in pain due to a severe bladder
infection. Things change with the arrival of John Coffey (Michael
Clarke Duncan), a hulk of a man sentenced to die for the murder of two
little girls. The guards soon learn that, despite his physically
imposing appearance, Coffey is a timid sort with the soul of a
child. Edgecombe discovers even more when the gentle giant abruptly
reaches out and cups the guard's crotch. The man isn't copping a feel:
Coffey is a bona fide healer. He magically absorbs Edgecombe's
infection, then releases the bad hoodoo by coughing up
computer-generated fly-like things that dissolve into the air above
him.
Despite clocking in at a whopping three hours, the bulk of "The Green
Mile" glides by, thanks to some extremely likable cast members,
including a cute-as-a-button pet mouse. The film drags only during the
cumbersome contemporary segments that bookend the story and when Hanks
drops by for a needless visit with fellow "Forrest Gump" veteran Gary
Sinise.
"The Green Mile" works best when Darabont focuses on Edgecombe and his
wife Jan (Bonnie Hunt); humane fellow guards Brutus "Brutal" Howell
(David Morse), sensitive newcomer Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and
seasoned vet Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn); and their
interactions with equally likable inmates Eduard Delacroix (Michael
Jeter - far less annoying than usual), Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham
Greene) and especially Michael Clarke Duncan, ole E.T. himself. Duncan
gives an absolutely convincing performance as the massive man-child:
he is so lovable that you want to take him home and treat him to about
a hundred Happy Meals.
Unfortunately, the aforementioned cast is so charming that the
cell-block often feels less like death row and more like an extra
large version of Andy and Barney's Mayberry jail. When Darabont cuts
to the demented exploits of his two cartoonish villains, sadistic
guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) and whacked-out prisoner "Wild
Bill" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), I half expected Aunt Bea to show up and
settle them down with some biscuits and apple butter.
The notion of a cozy, folksy death row seems especially bizarre during
the execution scenes. Imagine Barney Fife saying, "Come on, Otis,
we're gonna take a little stroll down the hall, hook you up to 'Old
Sparky,' then fry you like a Tater Tot," and you'll get the idea. One
electric chair sequence midway through the film is particularly
graphic and appropriately revolting. I would like to believe that
images such as these might give pause to proponents of capital
punishment, but if those folks can't grasp the concept that, if the
premeditated murder of another person is wrong, we shouldn't
collectively agree to do it, then visual aids probably won't help.
If you don't find the leapfrogging between homespun moments and grisly
deaths too disconcerting, then you should enjoy "The Green Mile" as a
cheesy, but absorbing fable with some dandy acting. I did, although in
the latter portions of the film, when Darabont drops the "E.T." motif
in favor of ham-handed religious allegory (John Coffey = J.C. = guess
who?), I found myself hoping for Coffey to lean out of the screen,
touch my forehead with his glowing fingertip and intone, "Go home."

The central idea of "Pay It Forward" is this: Do something to help three
people. Something hard. Something they could not do for themselves. Then
tell each recipient that, instead of paying you back, he or she should
go out and help three other people. As more and more individuals "pay it
forward," the acts of kindness will build exponentially, creating a more
benign Earth.
It's a wonderful idea, a noble idea; one that I (along with many others,
I suspect) intend to put into practice. Unfortunately, when writer
Catherine Ryan Hyde decided to turn her idea into a book, she apparently
felt our cynical culture would not accept such a sweet concept unless it
was couched in ugliness, pain and sacrifice. So she laid the melodrama
on thick, creating a tearjerker that turned the central character into
the Jesus Christ of New Age spirituality. Her strategy worked and the
novel was a hit. Now comes the movie.
"Pay It Forward," the film, has the best of intentions. The cast is
outstanding and the production contains quite a few effective sequences.
But the movie suffers from Mimi Leder's ham-handed direction, a script
that takes the novel's disparate subplots and ties them into a too-tidy
bow, and a climactic visual shamelessly ripped-off from "Field of
Dreams."
The main story follows seventh-grader Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel
Osment), a latch-key kid living in a run-down Las Vegas neighborhood
with his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt), an alcoholic working two jobs to
support the family. At the beginning of the school year, Trevor's new
social studies teacher, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), presents the
class with an extra-credit challenge: "Think of an idea to change our
world  and put it into action."
Trevor takes the assignment seriously and comes up with the pay it
forward concept. To test his theory, he offers shelter and some money to
Jerry (James Caviezel), a homeless drug addict. When a startled Arlene
encounters Trevor's new friend, she storms to the school, furious that a
teacher would give her child such a dangerous assignment. There she
meets the utterly mystified Simonet, a fastidious, well-spoken creature
of habit with a badly scarred face and a guarded demeanor. Thus begins a
tentative relationship between the two damaged souls, with Trevor paying
it forward by playing matchmaker.
The primary storyline is interwoven with a subplot that begins several
months later in Los Angeles, when reporter Chris Chandler (Jay Mohr) is
the recipient of a lavish gift from a stranger on a rainy night.
Pursuing his benefactor, Chandler learns about the pay it forward idea
and decides to trace it back to its origin. A series of vignettes
follow, as the investigation gradually leads the writer to Trevor.
Moving the setting of the story from the heartland to Las Vegas was
inspired. Where most films focus solely on the glitz of the city's
casinos, "Pay It Forward" presents Las Vegas from the residents' point
of view, accenting the gulf between working-class folk and the flashy
opulence of the buildings that glow in the distance.
Hiring Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment was another wise
decision. Spacey continues his career path from character actor to
mainstream leading man with another carefully etched performance. Hunt
also creates a rich, well-drawn character and young Osment is as
impressive here as he was in "The Sixth Sense."
Most of the supporting cast must deal with underwritten parts. Angie
Dickinson does good work as a bag lady and Jim Caviezel touches the
heartstrings as the desperate Jerry, although his doe eyes are played up
more than is necessary. In the reporter role, Jay Mohr is serviceable,
as is Jon Bon Jovi in a brief appearance as Trevor's wayward father.
Other aspects of the production are less successful. Thomas Newman's
otherworldly score is overly reminiscent of his haunting "American
Beauty" soundtrack. Continuity problems abound courtesy of the makeup
department. Maybe it's the lighting, but Simonet's facial scars appear
to change from scene to scene. The same happens with Jerry's teeth,
which appear to grow markedly nastier whenever he delivers an
angst-filled speech.
But the biggest problems lie in the screenplay and direction. The
teacher in the book received his wounds during the Vietnam War. The
source of Simonet's injuries (which I won't reveal here) is different,
concocted by scriptwriter Leslie Dixon as part of a needless and
unwelcome attempt to connect two storylines with an extra level of pain.
Her efforts to tidy up the book (watch as a hitchhiking Jerry hops out
of a truck and walks onto a bridge, where he immediately encounters a
woman preparing to jump) only manage to make the proceedings seem
contrived.
As for Mimi Leder, the director needs to take a remedial course in
camera work. Beyond a criminal overuse of close-ups, she repeatedly aims
her lens at the wrong places. The most egregious offense occurs during a
sex scene, when the extremely self-conscious Simonet finally lets down
his guard with another person. Leder foolishly elects to show the
teacher opening his shirt to reveal his scarred torso. Instead of being
entranced by the intimacy between Simonet and his partner, we end up
studying the makeup crew's handiwork.
And then there's the ending of the film, which you will find either
deeply moving or totally unnecessary. Whether you leave the theater
sniffling or angry, I hope you remember that, regardless of its many
problems, "Pay It Forward" puts forth an idea that actually could alter
this planet. If enough of us are as dedicated and industrious as Trevor,
we can take this overwrought, cumbersome fiction and create a better
reality.

Bridget Jones is an easy target. Smoking and wincing almost constantly,
she stumbles from one social scene to another, always wearing her heart
on her sleeve. A walking, talking typographical error, she is the
perfect foil for those who traffic in withering remarks. Likewise,
"Bridget Jones's Diary" practically begs to be insulted. The film is
obvious and sloppy, filled with trite sitcom hijinks and overly broad
secondary characters. But the bottom line is that both the character and
the film are so charming that it's relatively easy to overlook their
flaws.
Not that they won't be listed, of course.
"Bridget Jones's Diary" is based on a book I've never heard of that is
apparently an enormous hit with women (that this female phenomena
escaped my notice is not surprising. I only recently learned that Oprah
Winfrey is using her talk show to start a religion). It debuted in 1995
as a British newspaper column by Helen Fielding, who turned it into a
novel the following year. Fielding also co-wrote the script along with
Andrew Davies, (who penned the television adaptation of "Pride and
Prejudice") and "Notting Hill" author Richard Curtis.
The story opens at Christmas, as Bridget (Renee Zellweger) strikes out
from London to spend the holiday with her parents. At a family party,
her mother tries to set her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), the
visiting son of a neighbor, cheerfully explaining that when the two were
children, Bridget used to run naked through his wading pool. The
encounter goes terribly, with the oh-so-proper man treating her with
contempt (she hears him describe her as a "verbally incontinent
spinster"). Totally embarrassed, Bridget returns to her home and the
comfort of her friends. To begin the New Year, she starts a diary, while
vowing to settle for a "nice, sensible boyfriend."
Instead, she ends up exchanging saucy on-the-job e-mails with her boss,
Daniel (Hugh Grant). Almost as amusing as their messages is the computer
system itself, which was obviously purchased from the Movie Land
Electronics Boutique. Where e-mail on our world comes grouped together
in small type, Movie Land e-mail appears in very large letters, with the
appearance of each word timed for maximum comic effect.
Bridget and Daniel start dating, and she learns that Mark went to
college with Daniel and the two were friends until Daniel learned that
Mark was having an affair with his fiancee.
Meanwhile, on the parental front, things are getting wacky. Mom (Gemma
Jones) leaves Dad (Jim Broadbent) to become a product presenter on the
Home Shopping Channel and starts a romance with one of its smarmy hosts.
Bridget soon finds herself in the same boat as her father when she
catches Daniel in the arms of another woman.
Humiliated, the quits her job (with a perfectly splendid exit scene) and
sets out once again to better herself. In short order, she lands a job
as a reporter on a current-affairs TV show, where she becomes a success
despite some extraordinary bumbling. At a dinner party, she runs into
Mark, who knocks her off her feet when he states that he likes her,
"just the way you are."
As anyone who watches romantic comedies knows, this is far from the end
of the story.
I realize that, on paper, "Bridget Jones's Diary" sounds lame, but trust
me, it works much better onscreen. Well, most of it. A "Bridget can't
sing" bit in a karaoke bar is terribly overdone and a "Bridget can't
cook" scene is straight out of "Bad Sitcoms 101." Most of the secondary
characters are underwritten and the subplot involving Bridget's parents
plays as if a key scene is missing.
Yet the film still succeeds. Part of the reason is how easy it is to
relate to Bridget, the consummate uneasy goof trying, and mostly
failing, to break her bad habits and chart a better life. Sound like
anyone you know?
And then there are the lead players. Colin Firth is dead-on as a sullen
little boy residing in the body of an effete adult. Meanwhile, Hugh
Grant looks and acts healthier and more assured than I've ever seen him
before. As a suave leading man with questionable morals, he is letter
perfect. Both performers handle the physical comedy adroitly as well. A
fierce, wonderfully inept fight between them is one of the highlights of
the movie.
But best of all is Renee Zellweger. Her casting raised a stir in
Britain, where fans of the book questioned the appropriateness of an
American playing a beloved English character. They also questioned her
ability to pull off the accent. Skeptics be damned, Zellweger gets it
right. Her accent is fine and her performance, aside from the karaoke
scene, is flawless. She is the embodiment of insecurity, need, resolve,
failure and eternal hope. Few actors could flesh out such a character
without becoming either excessively cute or coy. Thankfully for "Bridget
Jones's Diary," they hired one who could.

Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
L.A. Confidential", a review by Ed Johnson-Ott.

In "L.A. Confidential", James Ellroy's novel of police corruption in 
1950's Hollywood becomes a powerful, stylish film with dazzling acting 
from an exceptional cast. Gorgeous art direction highlights the lurid 
pulp tone of this complex, violent tale. "L.A. Confidential" is a rarity, 
a major Hollywood film with smart acting, dialogue and production values 
that actually works from beginning to end.
The noir thriller about rogue cops takes place in 1953, when Los Angeles 
still seemed glamorous and magical, as opposed to now, where it is simply 
the worst city on Earth. A major mob boss goes to jail, prompting a 
feeding frenzy as bad guys scramble for his turf. Meanwhile, a corrupt 
officer is one of the victims of a grisly coffee shop murder, triggering 
a massive police investigation. Against this background, we meet Bud 
White (Russell Crowe), an attack dog cop with a unique personal moral 
code; Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a slick operator who collaborates 
with a scandal magazine to insure high-profile arrests; and Ed Exley (Guy 
Pearce), a self-righteous prig who knows how to work departmental 
politics to further his own agenda.
The art direction of "L.A. Confidential" is spectacular, perfectly 
recreating a picture-postcard Hollywood. Director Curtis Hanson uses the 
sets masterfully, layering realistic bits of detail over the splashy 
backdrops to simultaneously accentuate and offset the sense of glamour.
"L.A. Confidential" features near-flawless acting from its large ensemble 
cast. Russell Crowe ("Romper Stomper", "Virtuosity") gives an Oscar-
caliber performance as Bud White, a great bull of a man who has learned 
to slug, rather than think his way through situations. Initially, White 
seems to be a simple thug, but there's far more to him than meets the eye.
Guy Pearce ("Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert") is striking as the 
sanctimonious Ed Exley. His most impressive moment comes during an 
interrogation scene, where his manipulative skills while grilling a trio 
of suspects is both repellent and mesmerizing.
As Jack Vincennes, star-struck technical advisor for a "Dragnet"-style TV 
series, Kevin Spacey ("The Usual Suspects") demonstrates why he is one of 
the most respected actors anywhere. Spacey has a great face, and he uses 
his craggy features to convey just what happens when a man trades his 
morals for the spotlight. 
Kim Basinger is also strong in her best role in years, as a high-priced 
call girl who becomes involved with White. Basinger does fine work adding 
nuance to a character who is basically a live-action Jessica Rabbit.
Surprisingly, the film's only shaky performance comes from veteran actor 
James Cromwell ("Babe") as Capt. Dudley Smith. Cromwell plays his 
character well, but inexplicably jumps back and forth between American 
and Irish accents. In the future, James, pick a country and stick with it.
With nods to "Pulp Fiction" and "Chinatown", "L.A. Confidential" is 
complicated, but never muddy. The complex tale is told in a 
straightforward fashion, resulting in an utterly engrossing piece of 
filmmaking. The movie was a sensation at the Cannes Film Festival and 
come next March, should draw a lot of attention at the Academy Awards as 
well.

I loved virtually every minute of the first "Jurassic Park," including
the parts other people hated. The slow build-up to the arrival on the
island  loved it. The awestruck paleontologists gaping at dinosaurs
with the Official Steven Spielberg Look of Wonder  loved it. The
animated mascot explaining the cloning process  loved it. I admit the
scene where the little boy gets zapped off the top of an ultra
high-voltage electric fence and recovers almost instantly was a bit
much, and the ending was flat, but the magic and majesty of the
production more than made up for the flaws.
Like many fans, I was disappointed with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park."
The T-Rex assault at cliff's edge was incredible, but the overall dark
tone was draining and I hated the Godzilla-Lite finale. Which brings us
to "JP3." Memories of the original had me juiced for big dino-fun, while
thoughts of the sequel kept my expectations sufficiently low. I was
ready.
Joe Johnston takes the directorial rein from Spielberg and `Jurassic
Park III' starts off great, with the welcome return of Sam Neill as
grouchy Dr. Alan Grant (Laura Dern even pops up briefly as retired
paleobotanist Ellie Sattler). Decked out in an Indiana Jones hat, Neill
sets the tone for what looks to be a smart, solid story, giving an
assured performance. But once the cast lands on Isla Sorna, the
mysterious second island that appeared out of nowhere in "The Lost
World," the action ratchets up while the intelligence goes down. The
bulk of the 92 minutes consists of people running from a wide variety of
dinosaurs until all of the sudden everything wraps up quickly and
neatly in a cop-out ending.
I still had fun, though. To put it in thrill ride terminology, "Jurassic
Park" felt like an entire tour of the world's best amusement park
condensed into two hours, "The Lost World" felt like a trip on a big,
creaky wooden roller coaster and "JP3" feels like a spin on a smooth
steel coaster without inversions. At no point does any scene in the film
approach the tension of the T-Rex or raptor attacks from the other
movies, but the production moves fast enough to provide some breezy
pleasure.
Here's the set-up. In the eight years since the original debacle in
Jurassic Park, funding for dinosaur research has grown scarce, forcing
men like Dr. Grant to plead for money before unsympathetic ears. Enter
husband and wife adventurers Paul (William H. Macy) and Amanda (Tea
Leoni) Kirby, offering a blank check if Grant will serve as tour guide
for an aerial pass over Isla Sorna. Grudgingly, he accepts, bringing his
protégé Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) along to see the big lizards.
But wait, it's all bullshit! The Kirbys are actually a middle class
divorced couple searching for their 14-year-old son Eric (Trevor
Morgan), who disappeared on the island while vacationing with Amanda's
boyfriend. The distraught parents shanghai Grant believing that his
knowledge of the dinosaur habitat will allow him to navigate the land
and rescue the boy, forgetting that Grant wasn't in the sequel and thus
never visited Isla Sorna.
That oversight is merely the first dopey trickle in what becomes a
torrential downpour of stupidity. Freshly stranded in predator-central,
Amanda immediately starts calling her son's name over a megaphone. When
a T-Rex faces the group and Grant firmly states, "Don't move a muscle,"
everyone else in the expedition runs like hell. Billy, a trainee of Dr.
Grant, steals some eggs from the fiercely protective raptors.
Incidentally, you'll be happy to know that, while the human IQs plummet,
the raptors just keep getting smarter, now displaying the ability to
verbally communicate with each other. Maybe they should have written the
script.
Luckily, the dim-witted Homo sapiens have other gifts. For example,
Billy can take a damaged parachute and turn it into a fully functioning
parasail, all while being chased by blood thirsty animals. And all the
strandees have some sort of internal radar enabling them to find lost
colleagues on the vast isle as if they were two or three aisles away at
the local Wal-Mart.
A word on the visuals. The special effects here are the weakest in the
series. Things look good for the most part, but too often the computer
graphics are obvious and the animatronic critters look like puppets. And
I won't even start on the chintzy matte paintings or the lame
blue-screen work during the early parasailing shots.
Yet I still had fun. Despite the idiotic people, the absurd level of
coincidence, the spotty special effects and the lazy ending, I still
liked "Jurassic Park III." Maybe I was just in the mood for silly, fast
paced summer fun. Or maybe my IQ is dropping too.

Review for Hope Floats (1998)
Hope Floats (1998)
Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, Mae Whitman, Michael 
Pare, Cameron Finley. Directed by Forest Whitaker. 115 minutes.
PG, 3 stars (out of five stars)
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly
www.nuvo-online.com/film/

"Hope Floats" is a pretty good movie for a chick flick. Now, before you 
start yelling about sexism, read a little further. The term "chick flick" 
is used, often derisively, to describe a certain type of romantic movie. 
Aimed at female audiences, chick flicks are tearjerkers featuring noble 
women who suffer, usually due to an insensitive male or a horrible 
disease. When not busy agonizing or looking wistfully into the distance, 
the women bond with each other and learn important lessons about life. 
More often than not, chick flicks include one dance scene with a hunky 
guy, three angry confrontations where hurtful words are exchanged, a 
speech about forgiveness, and the death of at least one pivotal character.
 The films invariably end with our plucky heroine, bruised, but wiser, 
taking the first tentative steps into the next phase of her life.
As anyone who has seen "Field of Dreams" or "Good Will Hunting" knows, 
there are male versions of chick flicks. In these, the main guy mopes 
around a lot while his buddies fret about him (in a very masculine way, 
of course.) After a few angry confrontations and lots of cussing or 
spitting, the leading man has an emotional breakthrough and hugs his 
father, or a father figure, while sobbing. Embarrassed but wiser, the 
guys exchange mock insults, then our hero takes the first tentative steps 
into the next phase of his life, while the men in the audience quickly 
dry their eyes before the lights come up.
See, it all balances out. 
Everyone enjoys a good cry and there's nothing inherently wrong with 
either the male or female versions of chick flicks, as long as the 
material is handled well. Despite its downbeat storyline, "Hope Floats" 
works more often than not, thanks to Sandra Bullock's charisma and 
director Forest Whitaker's sense of style and attention to detail.
The film begins on a Jerry Springer style talk show, where Bullock's 
character has come to receive a makeover. Instead, the naďve Chicago 
housewife is ambushed by her best friend and husband, who inform her that 
they are having an affair. Heartbroken and humiliated in front of a 
national audience, she packs up her daughter and heads home to Smithville,
 Texas, where she was once the Corn Queen.  
The bulk of the film deals with adjustments, as Bullock licks her wounds 
and tries to figure out what to do next while dealing with her 
traumatized daughter, crusty mother and a handsome ex-schoolmate who has 
a crush on her.
Sandra Bullock has laid low since her natural charm was snuffed in last 
years megabomb, "Speed 2: Cruise Control," which even she conceded was a 
"stinker." Bullock doesn't have a great deal of range as an actor, but 
"Hope Floats" plays to her strengths and she comes off smelling like a 
rose. Harry Connick Jr., another actor with limited range, is well-cast 
as the resident studmuffin and young Mae Whitman does fine as Bullock's 
daughter. Playing the earthy Texas matriarch, Gena Rowlands has a number 
of effective scenes, although her character, who trots out ghoulish 
stuffed animals along with her homilies, is overly reminiscent of Barnard 
Hughes' taxidermist grandpa in "The Lost Boys."
What keeps "Hope Floats" from playing like just another Lifetime Channel 
movie is Bullock's effervescence and Forest Whitaker's direction. 
Whitaker, one of America's finest actors, hit big as a director with 
"Waiting To Exhale," and exhibits great assurance here, using imaginative 
camera work to add flair to the low-key storyline. Whitaker establishes 
an easygoing pace, then explores the details of this small town, from a 
playful lip-sync scene to a beautiful dissolve from a real landscape to 
the figures inside of a glass snow globe. He provides the film with a 
sense of grace that makes even the more mawkish scenes tolerable.
The best moments in "Hope Floats" are the little ones; a showdown between 
the daughter and a pudgy school bully, a gentle, but frank discussion 
with a spiteful employment agent, and a very nice moment when Connick 
explains why he does woodworking as a hobby instead of a full-time job. 
"You find something you love," he says, "then you twist and turn it 
trying to find a way to make money from it. By the time you're finished, 
you can't even remember what it was you loved." Thanks goodness that 
doesn't hold true to film criticism.
In the vast realm of chick flicks, "Hope Floats" is a minor pleasure. 
Sure, it's no "Terms of Endearment," but it's light years better than 
fare like "A Thousand Acres." Whitaker has crafted a film of small truths 
and lyrical moments. He's also given Sandra Bullock a chance to get her 
career back in motion. As long as she steers clear of cruise ships, she 
should do just fine.

Jim Carrey is wonderful as the title character in "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas." Despite being trussed up in a cumbersome lycra spandex suit
covered with thousands of green-dyed yak hairs, elaborate facial makeup,
contact lenses and false teeth, Carrey moves about with great vigor, as
if he had inhabited the Grinch's body from birth. His expressions are
even more fluid  it's amazing to see the actor project such a wide
range of emotion with rubber appliances glued all over his noggin. In
terms of style, the Grinch is a blustery, hyperactive drama queen and
Carrey absolutely nails him. The excess, the overindulgence that made so
many of Carrey's earlier performances cringe-worthy serves him perfectly
in this context. He is at his best when the Grinch is alone, stretching
out like some mutant hybrid of a mountain lion and Oscar Madison while
checking his schedule. "Let's see," he purrs malevolently, "4 o'clock:
Wallow in self-pity. 4:30: Stare into the abyss. 5 o'clock: Come up with
a solution to world hunger and don't tell anybody."
Although I found Jim Carrey's work delightful, I left the screening of
the high profile holiday offering less than satisfied, wondering why
Hollywood felt the need to take a nice, uncomplicated, 22-minute cartoon
and redo it as a live action extravaganza. Theodor S. Geisel (AKA Dr.
Seuss), who wrote the original story and collaborated on the TV version,
apparently shared my sentiments, turning away those eager to transform
his books into movies. As regards "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," he
was quite satisfied with the 1966 animated TV show and didn't think it
could be improved upon.
In the press kit for the feature, the producers trumpet the fact that
many filmmakers had sought permission to make Dr. Seuss movies and
"Geisel repeatedly turned down their requests. Until now." Gosh, I
wonder if the fact that Geisel died in 1991 might have been a factor in
his change of attitude?
Actually, Geisel's widow, Audrey, authorized the film and reportedly
used her veto power to ax a few scenes she found inappropriate. If only
she had monitored the screenplay (written by the men responsible for the
big-screen dud, "Wild Wild West") as closely, she would have seen where
the adaptation went wrong.
The 1966 cartoon told a simple story well. The denizens of Whoville were
gentle beings happily working together to prepare for Christmas. Up in
the mountains, the wicked Grinch, whose heart was "two sizes too small,"
glared down at the villagers and concocted a plan to quash their spirit.
On Christmas Eve, dressed as Santa Claus, he stole all their presents,
their decorations and even their food. The next morning, instead of
hearing cries of anguish, the Grinch listened as the folks in Whoville
sang together in joy, unaffected by their material losses. Finally
realizing the true meaning of Christmas, the Grinch tearfully returned
everything and joined the Whos in their festivities.
To expand the tale to feature length, the new writers opt to look at why
the Grinch became so mean. In doing so, they turn Whoville inside out.
The big-screen Whos race about town trying to balance loads of presents.
When little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) tries to ask her father, Lou
Lou (Bill Irwin), about what the holiday really stands for, he is too
busy shopping to answer her. Mother Betty Lou (Molly Shannon) is no help
either; she and neighbor Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski) snipe
at one another while battling to see who can decorate their house more
lavishly.
It gets worse. We learn that the Grinch grew up in Whoville, where he
was mocked for looking different and being poor. When Cindy tries to
reconcile the adult Grinch with the town, pompous city leader May Who
(Jeffrey Tambor) does his best to keep the Grinch an exile.
Changing the Whos from idyllic sprites into clones of us is a bad idea.
It taints the film, adding bitter where before there was only sweet.
This may sound like nit picking, but remember, we're talking about a
beloved Christmas classic. Would it really be so hard to keep the fable
pure?
The transition from animation to live action suffers in other areas as
well. While Whoville retains the fairyland appearance of the original,
it never seems like anything more than a big set covered with
unconvincing fake snow. Director Ron Howard's lighting and camerawork
only add to the claustrophobic, artificial feel. As for the Whos,
attempts to make them physically resemble cartoon characters succeed
only with a few actors (Clint Howard actually looks better than usual),
while most of the others come off like the alien-of the-week from any
latter day "Star Trek" series (poor Molly Shannon is virtually
unrecognizable beneath her facial appliances).
The bottom line? As much as I enjoyed Jim Carrey's performance, I'll
take "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" in its 22-minute animated form,
where the Whos remain innocent, the story remains uncluttered and
Whoville looks like a magical village instead of the set for an
expensive grade school play.

The question applies to all involved parties: writers Clark Gregg and
Sarah Kernochan, stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, director
Robert Zemeckis, and the marketing department at DreamWorks.
First up are the writers. It's easy to imagine Gregg and Kernochan
sitting in a room, kicking around ideas. Sadly, most of the ideas belong
to other people. "What Lies Beneath" begins with a healthy dose of "Rear
Window," sprinkles in a bit of "Sixth Sense," pours the results into the
shower scene from "Psycho," then ladles on heaps of "Fatal Attraction"
and even a little "Friday the 13th." What were they thinking?
Incidentally, when perusing the writers' list of cinematic "samples,"
please note that they start by stealing from exceptional films and end
up ripping off dreck. To no surprise, the movie follows the same
downward spiral.
Claire Spencer (Pfeiffer) has too much time on her hands. With her
daughter off at college and husband, Norman (Ford), preoccupied with
work, she wanders the grounds of their Vermont home, looking for
something to fill the gap left by the absence of her loved ones. After
overhearing a fight between the neighbors, she finds herself spying on
the house, fearing that the husband may have done harm to his wife.
Then things begin to happen at Claire's own home. The front door opens
on its own just as she reaches for the handle. She hears a barely
audible voice from the shadows. Initials appear on a computer screen.
And then Claire glances into the tub and sees the reflection of a
woman's face. Terrified, she turns to Norman, who, of course, doesn't
believe her.
That's as much as I can tell you without revealing key plot points.
Unfortunately, the brain trust at DreamWorks advertising department had
no problems in that area. Trailers for "What Lies Beneath" casually
spill roughly three-fourths of the storyline. While not as extreme as
some ad campaigns (such as the one for "Double Jeopardy," which provided
a Cliffs Notes version of the whole damn plot), it remains an annoying
example of marketing at its most idiotic. What were they thinking?
And what was Robert Zemeckis thinking? Why is the man who directed such
original fare as "Back to the Future" and "Forrest Gump" slumming with a
movie like this? To his credit, he handles the material with style, at
least for the first hour. I appreciated the way he eased into the ghost
business, ever so gently pulling the viewer into Claire's nightmare.
Equally impressive is his use of camera angles and lighting, which
transform Claire and Norman's picturesque home into something quite
ominous.
But Zemeckis is so intent on drawing shrieks from his audience that he
doesn't know when to quit. As the film progresses, he tightens his
framing so much that anything that enters the screen startles the
viewer. Sure, the technique makes people scream, but it's an awfully
lazy way to get it done. Late in the film, some of the camera angles
become downright embarrassing, especially in a
menacing-hands-approaching-the-camera-lens shot that looks like an
outtake from an Ed Wood horror flick.
And then there's Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. As always,
Pfeiffer is fascinating to watch. Those cat eyes and that angular face
are mesmerizing  the woman has a great skull. Her acting is fine here,
although I wonder why she didn't challenge the filmmakers over the
inconsistencies of her character. Alone, Claire takes the initiative,
even as her situation becomes increasingly dangerous, so why is she so
mousy around her husband? We learn that Claire gave up her cello for her
family. Why? Norman certainly didn't give up anything, so why did she
forfeit something so precious? And why, late in the film, did Pfeiffer
consent to behave like a camp counselor from "Friday the 13th? "
For Harrison Ford, "What Lies Beneath" marks the latest in a recent
series of odd career moves. As in "Random Hearts," Ford plays a dour,
brooding husband. Oh sure, he livens up in the second half of the film,
but I didn't buy the transformation for a second. Harrison, please, sign
up for another Indiana Jones or Jack Ryan movie as fast as you can and
don't ever take a role like this again.
Come to think of it, that would be my advice to everyone involved with
this movie. "What Lies Beneath" delivers more than its share of cheap
thrills, but the operative word here is "cheap." Movies like this should
be left for actors and directors on their way up, or on their way down,
not for talents as vital as Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford and Robert
Zemeckis.

According to its press notes, "The Last Castle" is about the character
of leadership. That, at least, is the line director Rod Lurie used to
convince Robert Redford to sign on the dotted line. From my chair, the
film is a silly, pretentious and generally entertaining yarn about the
pissing war between a fallen leader and a wannabe. The names Robert
Redford and James Gandolfini may lead one to expect something profound,
but the film is essentially a Grade B thriller cut from the same cloth
as "Taps" or "Toy Soldiers." Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Three-star Army General Irwin (Redford) disobeyed a direct order that
resulted in the death of several soldiers. Irwin admits his guilt and
makes no excuses; that's the kind of man he is. Sentenced to seven
years, he is sent to The Castle, a military prison ruled by the iron
fist of Colonel Winter (Gandolfini), a man with no battle experience who
collects military implements.
Are you getting the picture? Accepting guilt for disobeying orders =
Hero. Filling display cases with battle regalia when you have no battle
experience = Poseur.
At first, Winter views Irwin with awe. He is relieved to hear that his
revered prisoner wants only to do his time and go home. All is well
until he gives Irwin a tour of his office and shows off his war toys.
While Winter is called away briefly, Irwin chats with an aide and quotes
a disparaging remark his father once made about non-combatants who
collect weapons. Winter returns to the area just in time to hear the
latter part of the quote and assumes Irwin has just taken a shot at him.
Oops, looks like the honeymoon is over.
Over the next few days, Irwin gets acquainted with his fellow prisoners,
particularly Yates (Mark Ruffalo), cynic and resident prison bookmaker,
and Aguilar (Clifton Collins Jr.), a wide-eyed hero worshipper who may
as well have the word "martyr" stitched to his uniform.
Irwin soon galvanizes the men. Forced to spend the day moving rocks as a
punishment, he struggles but refuses to quit, winning the respect of the
few prisoners that did not already bow down before him. Fed up with
Winter's pattern of inhumane treatment, Irwin makes a decision: He will
organize the men, take over the prison and fly the flag in the
upside-down distress position to force the removal of Winter.
The build up to the grand confrontation is patently ridiculous, which
keeps matters fun. There is a hard rule against inmates saluting one
another, so the boys come up with a twist  a man snaps his hand into
the salute position, but at the last second runs his fingers through his
hair, just like Fonzie used to do. The men are also forbidden to address
each other by rank, so they use substitute terms like "chief" instead of
"general," "boss" instead of "captain" and so on. Winter is helpless to
stop them from using the new gestures and words, so we get to witness a
prisoner honoring a superior officer by saying, "Thank you, chief" while
giving him a hearty Fonzie.
Oh, what remarkable prisoners they are. Presumably, some of these guys
are sociopaths, rapists, child molesters and murderers, but under the
influence of Chief Irwin, they become a unified force ready to risk life
and limb and lengthier sentences to bring down the warden.
The absurdity goes down easier thanks to the skill of the key players.
James Gandolfini, taking a break from his Tony Soprano persona,
amplifies the childishness of his character by over-enunciating his
words and smirking at unexpected moments. Meanwhile, Robert Redford
underplays his role, relying on his legendary charisma instead of
histrionics. Redford also sets the standard for the lighting of the
film. While his rugged good looks have defied the aging process, under
bright light his skin looks like contact paper. To adjust for this,
every camera is angled to keep his face in shadows. For the sake of
consistency, the same technique is used on most of the other actors,
giving the film an odd, but interesting, visual tone.
To the surprise of no one, the climax of the film is heavy on
coincidence, self-sacrifice, abrupt shifts in allegiance, flag waving
and, of course, explosions. Some people will likely accept "The Last
Castle" at face value and applaud its patriotic trappings. Others may
condemn director Rod Lurie for the cheesiness of it all. As for me, I
can only offer thanks for two hours of peculiar entertainment. Mr.
Lurie, I Fonzie you!

Quirky, smart and extremely entertaining, "Out of Sight" establishes its 
tone right from the opening scene. Bank robber Jack Foley (George 
Clooney) ambles up to a teller and lays out the score with casually 
authoritative inflection. Gesturing towards a total stranger applying for 
a loan at a nearby desk, he quietly states that the man is his partner 
who, if instructions are not followed to the letter, will shoot the bank 
officer. As the trembling employee gathers the cash, Foley notices her 
near-panic and says, with genuine concern in his voice, "Your first time 
being robbed? Well, you're doing great." After calming the young woman 
and collecting his bounty, he strolls out to the parking lot under the 
sunny Florida sky to make his escape, only to discover that his car won't 
start. 30 seconds later, he's under arrest.
"Out of Sight" is the first film based on an Elmore Leonard novel that 
truly captures the author's unique style. "Get Shorty" was lively fun, 
but overly glib. While "Jackie Brown" was a thoughtful, exceptionally 
well done character study, the production suffered from a detached, logy 
feel. In the hands of "sex, lies & videotape" director Steven Soderbergh, 
"Out of Sight" delivers the goods, adroitly mixing romance, violence and 
humor without compromising its characters or oversimplifying the story. 
Leonard writes in nonjudgmental fashion about oddly endearing lowlifes. 
His characters are lovable losers who make us laugh precisely because 
they don't know how funny they are. Soderbergh understands all of that, 
which is why the film works so well.
The story follows Jack to prison, where he quickly plots his escape. Of 
course, the break-out doesn't go as planned, thanks to the unexpected 
appearance of federal marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). Jack's 
accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames), scrambling to protect his friend, stuffs 
Jack and Karen into a car trunk for the getaway run, and sparks fly 
between the pair. After Buddy and Jack release her and head for Detroit, 
planning the proverbial "one last scam," Karen aggressively pursues Jack, 
although it's obvious that she's not entirely sure what she'll do if she 
catches him. 
While "Out of Sight" boasts a terrific cast, the spotlight rarely moves 
far from George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, who deliver knockout 
performances. Any doubts over whether Clooney can carry a film are 
removed here, as he deftly creates a charismatic, delightfully 
complicated scoundrel. Short sighted but fast on his feet, Jack presents 
himself with a beguiling assurance that never seems cocky. He's 
incredibly likable, even while doing awful things. Clooney looks good too,
 having finally ditched that silly Julius Caesar hairdo that was so 
trendy for a while, in favor of a swept back look befitting a movie star. 
Speaking of movie stars, Jennifer Lopez becomes a full-fledged one here 
as well, with a breakthrough performance as the perceptive, sexy and very 
conflicted federal marshal. Make no mistake, Karen Sisco is an effective 
cop, but she keeps finding herself drawn to the wrong men. Early in the 
film, her father (an uncharacteristically tender Dennis Farina) gently 
offers counsel on her personal life, all the while knowing that his 
resolute daughter must find her own way, however often she may stumble. 
And stumble she will, because this is an Elmore Leonard story, where the 
good guys are usually bad guys and everybody screws up. Sometimes they 
even realize the futility of their grandiose plans, although that never 
seems to slow them down. In one of the most telling scenes, Buddy talks 
about living the good life after they pull off their risky plan and Jack 
quietly says "You know anybody who has done the big score and gone on to 
live the good life?" 
The characters in "Out of Sight" may be sad sacks, but boy, are they fun 
to watch. Along with the always wonderful Rhames and Farina, the film 
boasts a stellar supporting cast including Albert Brooks (as a Michael 
Milken type), Don Cheadle from "Boogie Nights," "That Thing You Do's" 
Steve Zahn, plus uncredited appearances from Michael Keaton, reprising 
his "Jackie Brown" role as FBI agent Ray Nicolet, and Samuel L. Jackson. 
Despite the large cast, every character is fully developed and their 
stories weave in and out, aided by a loping, low key jazz score that 
accents the film's non-linear flow. 
It's all very complicated, but attentive viewers can easily keep up, and 
even if you do get lost, that's okay, because character is far more 
important than plot in "Out of Sight." The film has a number of intricate,
 beautifully staged set pieces, but even those dandy action scenes are 
character driven. The deliciously loopy "Out of Sight" takes a whacked 
look at the human condition, painting life as a series of misguided 
choices, a viewpoint that would be depressing if it wasn't so damned 
funny.

Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
The Newton Boys (1998)
Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Skeet Ulrich, Dwight 
Yoakum, Julianna Margulies, Chloe Webb, Charles Gunning. Directed by 
Richard Linklater. 122 minutes.
Rated PG-13, 3.5 stars (out of five stars)

The most surprising thing about "The Newton Boys" is that it took this 
long for somebody to make a movie about them. America loves turning 
bandits into folk heroes and these guys are naturals. During their five 
year crime spree, from 1919 through 1924, the Texas-born Newton brothers 
worked their way across the States and into Canada, holding up over 80 
banks and committing the largest train robbery in U.S. history. Along the 
way, they never stole from women or children, never killed anyone, and 
generally established themselves as well-mannered young rogues with 
charisma and a flair for the dramatic.
At least that's how director Richard Linklater tells it in "the true 
story of the most successful bank robbers in the history of the United 
States." While the accuracy of the story is debatable, there's no denying 
that Linklater has crafted an amiable, extremely smooth film and a great 
showcase for his cast of hot young actors. Matthew McConaughey, Ethan 
Hawke, Skeet Ulrich and Vincent D'Onofrio play the Newtons, with able 
assists from Dwight Yoakum as their explosives expert and Chloe Webb and 
"ER's" Julianna Margulies as the resident love interests. Although 
D'Onofrio, last seen as the dim-witted farmer-turned-alien villain of 
"Men In Black," is wasted here, McConaughey, Hawke and, to a lesser 
extent, Ulrich are given a welcome chance to strut their stuff. 
Following wince-inducing turns in "Contact" and "Amistad," Matthew 
McConaughey returns to form here, using his natural drawl in a relaxed, 
disarming performance as Willis, the leader of the boys. With an 
easygoing manner and a twinkle in his eyes, Willis is a born salesman. 
It's easy to understand why the brothers go along with his poorly thought 
out schemes and accept his strained rationalizations. 
Ethan Hawke, who wanders through most of his films appearing dazed, 
painfully earnest and a bit constipated, is a delight here as Jess, the 
wildest of the Newton boys. As a struggling farmer, Jess was just another 
lost Texas kid, but as a robber he comes into his own, virtually 
intoxicated playing out his new-found role as a larger-than-life folk 
hero. Hawke's best moments come in a courtroom scene where Jess charms 
the pants off of everyone in the room, grinning broadly while tossing 
fanciful one-liners to the judge, spectators and reporters. 
As Joe, the youngest of the brothers, Skeet Ulrich initially operates as 
the conscience of the group, skeptical of Willis' claims that bank 
robbery is justifiable because the boys are just little Robin Hoods, 
taking money from the real thieves, those companies insuring the banks. 
Joe eventually falls in line, but remains the grimmest of the boys, 
portrayed with appropriate intensity by Ulrich, who looks for all the 
world like a low-rent, heroin-chic version of Johnny Depp.
Films in this genre rarely give women much to do and "The Newton Boys" is 
no exception, although Margulies and Webb make the most of their small 
roles. In addition to being a fine actor, Julianna Margulies has a 
classically-beautiful face that was made for the movies. Sooner or later, 
she'll find the right vehicle for her talents and make the jump from TV 
to film stardom in a big way.
Director Linklater, whose previous films ("Slacker," "Before Sunrise," 
"subUrbia") focused on youthful angst, does good work in this pleasant 
change of pace, maintaining a breezy, playful tone and a strong sense of 
period authenticity. As the boys make their way across the country, 
Linklater paints a crisp portrait of the small, isolated towns in pre-
Depression America. A swing into Canada provides a appreciated twist on 
typical genre locales, with a nice look at Toronto in the '20s.  Adding 
to the atmosphere is a terrific soundtrack, featuring wonderful tunes 
from the period reworked by the Austin bluegrass trio "Bad Livers," with 
guest vocals from Patty Griffin, Abra Moore and others.
Be sure to stay for the movie's closing credits, which features actual 
interview clips from two of the Newton boys as old men. The real Willis 
appears in a 1975 documentary, while Joe turns up on an episode of "The 
Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson. Hearing the real characters discuss the 
very incidents depicted in the film adds a pleasant sense of closure to 
the piece.
Particularly in its early scenes, "The Newton Boys" is structurally 
reminiscent of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." While the film 
certainly isn't in the same league as "Butch," it does satisfy in its own 
low-key fashion. Linklater has created a lively, charming slice of 
Americana which delivers an abundance of minor pleasures. Streamlined and 
fast-paced, "The Newton Boys" is the most cheerful film to hit the 
screens in quite a while and, after three months of post-holiday 
cinematic dreck, one of the most welcome.

The pacing is uneven, the story has enough holes to fill the Albert Hall 
and the ending is a let down, but "Dr. Benderfax" is simply too damned 
likable to resist. The ultra low-budget independent feature is one of the 
oddest black comedies to come down the pike in quite some time. During 
its best moments, the movie plays like a freaky hybrid of "Andy Warhol's 
Frankenstein" and an episode of "The Kids In The Hall."
Dr. Benderfax (Nigel Hazeldine) is an unusually chipper mad scientist 
determined to prove his theories about a neuro-psychic phenomena called 
the telefaximial field (don't ask). With the assistance of ruthless Nurse 
Clench (Caroline Hazeldine), he heads a psychiatric hospital, harvesting 
mental patients for his experiments, which generally prove fatal. 
Unfortunately for Benderfax, his newest employee, idealistic Dr. Andrew 
March (Steve Gouveia), stumbles onto the truth, enlisting the help of 
Nurse Carmen (Merodie Patterson) and schizophrenic stalker Farance 
(Nicholas Berry) to thwart Benderfax's scheme.
The mad scientist story, of course, is straight from "Overworked 
Plotlines 101." The fun in "Dr. Benderfax" comes from the details. 
Writer/director Tom Hosler packs his debut feature with loads of odd 
performances and engaging quirks that kept me occupied even when the 
story sagged. For example, the film opens with an elderly chain smoker 
watching a faux production of "Robot Monster" on TV, while brow-beating 
his wife into going on a cigarette run for some Delta 100's. I've no idea 
whether the brand is obscure or invented (I suspect the latter), but the 
incessant product references were funny either way. Later, characters 
drink beer out of generic white cans labeled "Beer."
Hosler gives his actors a lot of leeway, with varying results. As a 
detective with a personal grudge against Benderfax, Jeffrey Blumberg 
adopts an extremely grating New York accent. If he was shooting for 
credibility, he should have toned it down, and if he was trying for comic 
stylization, he should have turned it up a notch or two. As is, he just 
comes off like an amateur. Likewise, Caroline Hazeldine's work as Nurse 
Clench uncomfortably veers between humorous caricature and community 
theater. 
As Farance, the schizophrenic sidekick, Nicholas Berry is effective, 
especially when his character tries to keep cool even as he hallucinates 
disembodied creeping arms in his backpack and refrigerator. One 
particularly inspired scene has him displaying exceptionally good manners 
when introduced to a headless body. At times, Berry reminded me of a 
young Eric Idle. Merodie Patterson is also good as Nurse Carmen, the most 
well-adjusted member of the cast.
Steve Gouveia does a wonderful job playing young Dr. March, exhibiting a 
gloriously manic peppiness. Bruce McCulloch of "The Kids In The Hall" 
used a similar approach for many of his characterizations of overly 
wholesome types with an undercurrent of obsession, and Gouveia excels at 
capturing that rare spirit. When he delivers a line like, "Ah, Froom's 
room, I presume," he manages to be funny and earnest simultaneously, 
quite a mean feat.
Best of all is Nigel Hazeldine, hilarious as the jaunty, very British and 
quite insane Dr. Benderfax. Hazeldine's finest moments come during his 
experiments, as he directs a constant stream of peppy chatter at his mute,
 terrified subjects. When poor Mr. Froom's body begins to twitch wildly, 
Benderfax casually says "What was that all about?" with a cheerful smile 
on his face. Later, he glances at the man's crotch and enthusiastically 
chirps "Looks like you're getting a stiffie there, Mr. Froom!" Great 
stuff.
While Dr. Benderfax the man is consistently delightful, "Dr. Benderfax" 
the movie often falters. The extras portraying various mental patients 
look painfully like extras playing mental patients. As for the script, 
even Hans Jorgen Fjellestad's exceptionally buoyant score can't prop up 
the numerous droopy spots. And the film's "shocking" climax is anything 
but climactic.
Still, the positives in "Dr. Benderfax" outweigh the negatives. This is 
one fun little movie, and an impressive debut for Tom Hosler. It will be 
interesting to see what the promising filmmaker does next. In the 
meantime, I look forward to spending another evening with "Dr. Benderfax" 
in the near future.

"Once Upon a Time in China" is considered a classic in its country of
origin. First released in 1991, the film was popular enough to spawn a
number of imitators, not to mention five sequels. Watching the original,
it's easy to understand why. The sprawling adventure showcases the
charismatic Jet Li and features romance, intrigue, picturesque settings
and a string of remarkably inventive fight scenes. What's not to like?
Jet Li stars as the legendary Chinese hero Wong Fei-Hong (nearly 100
films have been made about the icon, including Jackie Chan's "The Legend
of Drunken Master"). The actor does his own stunts (with some wirework
to jazz up the proceedings) and the results are spectacular. In addition
to the amazing battles, the story offers an interesting look at another
culture.
Set in the late 19th century, "Once Upon a Time in China" (in Cantonese
with English subtitles) shows a populace under siege from the outside
world. More and more often, colonial forces from the United States and
Britain turn up on native shores. Their presence is intimidating, to say
the least, but the indigenous people have no intention of succumbing.
Their resistance ranges from small (neighborhood musicians play and sing
at top volume to drown out the hymns of western missionaries) to
full-scale military face-offs.
The head of a healing clinic, Wong is asked by a general in the Black
Flag army to teach the locals self-defense by training them in the art
of kung fu. Things get complicated with the arrival of Wong's "Aunt" Yee
(Rosamund Kwan), just back from a two-year stay in the West. Despite her
title, Yee and Wong are not related and romance simmers between the two
(watch for a lovely bit of shadow flirting from Yee).
As for bad guys, there are too many here to keep track of. A gang from a
neighboring town tries to extort local businessmen, corrupt government
officials abound, and then there are those nasty foreigners. I tried to
keep up with them all, but soon gave up. My advice to you is to keep
your eyes on Wong, his comrades and Yee, and just watch the fireworks.
You can sort out the particulars on subsequent viewings.
And you will want to watch it again. While early segments of "Once Upon
a Time in China" contain some embarrassing low comedy, Jet Li's
performance, coupled with his kung fu wizardry, carries the viewer
through any shaky patches. The fight scenes are the main attraction, of
course, and the film delivers the goods again and again. My favorite is
a segment where Wong and his foe use ladders in a breathtaking duel.
Have fun choosing your own.
