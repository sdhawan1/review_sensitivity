Title
Review for Blues Brothers 2000 (1998)
**** out of *****
A big surprise to me.  The good trailer had hinted that they pulled the
impossible off, but making a Blues Brothers movie without Jake Blues (John
Belushi) is such a dumb idea I really had no hope.  They replaced him just
fine.  Not with John Goodman, he didn't do much of anything, but with the
brilliant actor Joe Morton, who can REALLY sing.  The fourth Blues Brother
is J Evan Bonifant, who's ten.  This was another of my fears for the film,
but he's a really good dancer, and plays a mean harmonica (although he may
have been dubbed).  Things that intellectually had bothered me before, like
no mission from God, everyone being richer, it not being filmed in Chicago
-- gave me no problems at all.  I'm quite pleased that there were less car
pile-ups, because they meant less music, and John Landis seems to have lost
interest in the whole thing.  There's a few early crashes, and then one
huge pile-up, but after that it all stops.  It's just the music.  One of my
problems with the first is that Cab Calloway's song is so good the actually
Blues Brothers look dull after him, but there's no problems with this.  the
music is all as good as ever, tons of great musicians showing up -- with
the exception of Johnny Lang, who can't sing, all the musicians do a great
job.  The only real problems I had was the special effects.  These were
superfluous and a waste of money.  Since the film isn't doing very well,
they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel, which I want to
see.  The bluegrass version of Riders in the Sky is even better than
Rawhide.

Title
Review for Borrowers, The (1997)
**** out of *****
The problem with kids films is that so many parents haven't taught their
kids not to talk during the movie.  The other problem is that you have to
sit though previews for movies starring Barney.  The last problem is that
most of them are terrible, most of them are from Disney, only ones from
Disney make money, and only ones that AREN'T from Disney are any good.  The
Borrowers (for once) takes an English book and keeps most of the actors
English, including all the Borrowers.  Some of the Beans are American, but
the whole setting is ambiguous and the cityscapes are surreal, they'd fit
in in a German expressionist film.  This film has been advertised as a
blatant Home Alone meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids pile of crap, but it
isn't.  It does tend to focus more on the danger aspect of Borrowing,
nearly getting caught, being seen and chased, etc., but that's a good
thing.  It's more cinematic, less stagy, and more interesting.  The sets,
costumes, and effects are all great.  They start with the illustrations
from the book, and get more creative -- a lot of the Borrowers wear clothes
made from rubber gloves.  The story line is tons of fun, and, though it
doesn't bear any relation to the books, it brings in all the best elements
from them, and creates some new ones.  A Borrower movie without Spiller is
not a Borrower movie, and he's also the best actor among the kids.  He's
the only one who can act against a blue screen.  This is the main problem
with the film -- it mainly focuses on the children, Arrietty (Flora
Newbigin), her brother Peagreen (Tom Felton), Spiller (Raymond Pickard),
and a child Bean (Bradley Pierce, Jumanji), all of whom are reasonably good
actors, but when seen in an effects shot, big things and small things at
once, go really bad really fast.  The scenes in which the Bean talks to
Arrietty are painful.  A pile of great comic actors play the adults, Celia
Imrie (In the Bleak Midwinter, and in Star Wars Episode 1) as Homily and
Jim Broadbent (Bullets Over Broadway) talking too slowly as Pod, John
Goodman as the villain, Mark Williams as an exterminator, and Hugh Laurie
as a policeman.  Jim Broadbent is normally a very good actor, but I have no
idea what he was trying for here -- at times it seems he's talking slowly
and clearly to ensure he's understood by the Beans, but he talks that way
to his family as well -- sometimes.  He looks exactly right -- everyone
does.  The cast seems to have been assembled more by look than skill, but
it works out somehow.  Probably because The Borrowers isn't a performance
driven film.  It's pure entertainment, with a good script that never allows
itself to be buried in stupidity like The Indian in the Cupboard did.  I
was really pleased with the film, it captured the spirit of the books, and
was lots of fun to watch.
