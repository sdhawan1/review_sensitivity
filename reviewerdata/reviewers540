Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
The Spice Girls' first film (of many?) is set over five days leading up
to their first live performance at the Albert Hall. Its a story which
has grown from the extentions of their adopted characters, the premise
is basically -:what if the Spice Girls really were Scary, Sporty,
Babyish, Posh and ...well..Ginger? How whould they act when thrown into
an equally make-believe 'film' setting?
The film is tongue in cheek about the Spice Girls, fame, fans, the
media, even the whole film concept, throughout the whole thing, their
manager is negotiating a deal for a film which it eventually turns out
that we're watching....circles within circles, cool.
The girls themselves were, on the whole, really good. By and large, they
sounded like they were just talking normally. With the exception of
Victoria, who I'm afraid just can't drag the words off the page and
reveals herself to be the least talented in yet another area. They stood
up,against a host of celebrities and actors without looking completely
outclassed and stupid. 
Talking of the numerous cameos, they are also treated with the same
self-pointed wit, especially Roger Moore as the Blofeld style, martini
drinking, all knowing big boss of the girls. 
In conclusion, it's two thumbs way, way up for the Spice Girls.
They don't just sing, you know.
