Review by R.L.Strong                 )1997 R.L. Strong
        Bob Clark's "DEATHDREAM" is without a doubt one of the Seventies most
important and effective horror films. Taking it's basic premise from the
classic tale of "The Monkey's Paw", the film combines vampirism with not
only the political climate of the Seventies and the war in Vietnam, but
also the youth movement. After years (decades?) of visceral horror being
the basic means by which terror is explored, "Deathdream" manages to do
the impossible in a horror film. It creates a mood and an atmosphere of
dread that is palpable. Just watching any scene from the first 50
minutes of the film, will give any viewer a sense of unease that they
will be unlikely to shake off immediately. "Deathdream" deals in a
disenfranchised Americana, where family values are being questioned and
faithfully held beliefs in family and honor are laid to rest.
        The plot of the film is pretty straight forward. Andy is a lieutenant
in the U.S. Army serving in Vietnam. He and his Captain are killed in a
firefight. As Andy dies, he hears the pleas of his Mother, telling him
not to die, that he must come home. We immediately switch to a small
Midwestern town, Anywhere USA. A truck driver picks up a soldier. He
stops off at a dinner, getting coffee and mentioning how strange the
Soldier is. "He hasn't said a word". He tells the waitress. At the
Brooks' home, the family is awakened in the middle of the night by the
arrival of the local enlistment office. He tells the family that their
son, Andy has been killed in the line of duty. The family is distraught.
Andy's Mother refuses to accept the idea that her only son is not coming
home. Later that night, the family is awakened again by the sound of
someone breaking into the house. Rushing downstairs, Mr. Brooks is
startled by his son, Andy, standing behind the front door in full
military uniform.
        Celebrations start immediately. Andy's Mother is overjoyed. Plans are
made to tell all of Andy's friends. Andy says not to. He just wants time
to rest.  His Father asks Andy if the situation in the War was bad. Andy
replies.. "Over where, Dad?" The next morning, news reports come in
telling of the murder of a truck driver. His throat is slashed, but he
also has hypodermic punctures in his arm. Andy isolates himself in his
room. He refuses to see any of his friends, or let his family
acknowledge that he is back. The tension between the family members
grows as Andy becomes more mysterious and threatening. As the Brooks
family begins to abandon their faiths and love for one another, Andy
becomes more treacherous, murdering the family Doctor, using his blood
(in one of the films most disturbing scenes) as a FIX.
        The performances are adequate for the most part. The standouts are John
Marley, one of the industries most underrated character actors as the
Father of the besieged Brooks family. His character becomes more and
more ineffectual as the film progresses, finally giving in to complete
depression. This performance alone makes the film worth viewing. Richard
Backus as ANDY gives a chilling interpretation of the walking dead. His
character is pure evil. This is a soulless and totally uncalculating
creature. Andy's soul purpose now is to inflict terror and pain on all
those around him. But mostly on his own family. Mr. Backus creates a
feeling of dread and fear that I haven't seen on screen until Anthony
Hopkins started asking for more wine
Director Bob Clark has created one of the most intelligent and emotional
horror films ever made. The film pays more tribute to the style of Val
Lewton than it does to the gore-miesters of it's decade. This is not to
say that the film does not contain scenes of visceral horror. The murder
of the town Doctor (played by Henderson Forsyth) is both frightening and
revolting. But Mr. Clark does not wallow in these scenes, he uses them
as a release from the tension that the film has been building too.
"Deathdream" in my mind should be included with the other classics of
the genre ("Exorcist", "Night of the Living Dead", "The Haunting") as a
classic. The script by Alan Orsmby ('Children Shouldn't Play With Dead
Things', 'My, Bodyguard') is marvelously structured. The dialogue is
honest and doesn't give into the standard type of one-liner mentality so
prevalent in horror films today. The cinematography by Jack McGowan is
wonderful in it's simplicity, recalling the best work of such good
cinematographers (but poor Directors) as T. V. Mikels and Ray Dennis
Steckler.
        This is not a film for children! The movie deals with issues that are
too adult and emotional for youngsters to grasp. Also, the violence in
the film is not romanticized. This is not "SCREAM" or any other film of
that type, that tries to compromise it's horror with a leveling spoonful
of comedy. It's not a cult film (though it could be if it had the
exposure it deserves). It is without a doubt, one of the 10 best horror
films of the seventies. And I would go on to say, of all time!
