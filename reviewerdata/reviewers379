Title
Review for Sister My Sister (1994)
This is an excellent film from Director Nancy Meckler. An adaptation of a true 
story of two sisters who become lovers; the performances by Joely Richardson 
and Jodhi May (the sisters) are inspiring. The intimacy between the two is 
touching and beautiful (and erotic). I especially liked the direction of these 
scenes - in particular, the breathing of the sister Lea.
The most convincing true love story since The Professional's Leon and Matilda.
I must also praise the screenplay. I thought that I might have to be 
patient with this film but that wasn't the case at all! From beginning to 
end the film had me hooked.
