Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
        Replacement Killers marks the American debut of Chow-Yun Fat. For 
those not familiar with his work, he has been in the business (TV and 
Film) for a long time. Most famous in America for his work with John Woo: 
The Killer, A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, and Hard Boiled, Chow's repertoire 
is not in any way restricted to action films. He has been in many 
comedies and dramas as well: Hong Kong 1941, God of Gamblers, and All 
About Ah-Long (for which he won a Best Actor award) are some of his best 
work in those areas.  
        Chow, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors who ever lived 
and the fact that Chinese is not my native tongue probably adds more to 
that title.  He was made for the camera.
        Now, it's true that Chow is amazing in gun-toting action roles, 
mainly because of his incomparable coolness and charisma.  It's a fact 
that no one looks better than Chow with a gun in each hand, therefore it 
was inevitable that Chow's first dive into American cinema would be an 
action film.
        Replacement Killers is not, in any way, a bad movie. The best way 
to describe it would be painfully mediocre.  
        The movie starts off well.  A man is being chased through the 
streets, and is captured and killed by a cop.  It turns out that he was 
the child of a very powerful man (Kenneth Tsang).  That powerful man 
wants revenge, the cop must be killed.  Enter John Li (Chow Yun-Fat).  
John is told that he must kill the cop's son and this will be his last 
job.  Well, John can't kill him because he has a heart of gold.  So, 
instead of killing the boy, he basically ruins the rest of his life 
putting himself and his family in danger.
        John needs a fake passport to China, and is sent to Meg Coburn 
(Mira Sorvino), bad guys come to kill her and John, and they fail.  The 
rest is pretty predictable.
        Chow's English is great.  He has two 'speeches' in the movie and 
they are both well-delivered. However, when he speaks in short sentences 
he sounds stiff.
        Well, action movies such as this are not often hailed for their 
intriguing character development.  What usually separates the good from 
the ugly in this genre is style.  Fuqua (whose only credit is directing 
Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise music video) handles the direction nicely.  
The action scenes, for the most part, look good, but never really become 
tense or exciting.  The main characters are 2-dimensional and the bad 
guys, even more-so.  There are quite a few memorable scenes, though. A 
short gun fight in a movie theater was nice.  Chow with a gun in both 
hands shooting down a car going in reverse was definitely cool.  There is 
also an interesting use of colors, neon greens, reds, etc.
        There are quite a few HK movie influences here, and when Fuqua 
gets creative, the result is excellent; but, there is not enough 
originality in this movie.  The atmosphere is cold and humorless, and any
emotion seems out of place.  Chow has an incredible smile, but this film 
never lets him use it.  
The print I saw had no music, and a good score could definitely help the 
movie out.

Review for Orgazmo (1997)
ORGAZMO
Directed and written by Trey Parker
Starring  Trey Parker, Dian Bachar, Masad `Maki' San
Running time  94 min. (may be cut for R rating)
PLOT:
              Parker plays Joe Young, a naďve Mormon who
cheerfully goes from house to house hoping to spread
the word of Christ.  He soon finds himself at the house
of porn director, Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs).
Joe gets into a fight outside the house, and Orbison is
so impressed with his skills that he persuades him to
play the super hero, Orgazmo in his new movie
Orgazmo.  Hesitant at first, Joe accepts because he
needs the money to get married to his fiancé.
CRITIQUE:
              Parker's first feature, with his partner Matt Stone,
was Cannibal: The Musical, a hilarious, low-budget film
made for Troma (and the reason Parker left college).
Orgazmo shows Parker's growth as a writer and director,
and proves to be one of the funniest comedies to come...
echem...along in awhile.
              Parker and Stone's careers basically began
because of the intense bootleg distribution of their
vulgar, 5 min., animated masterpiece, The Spirit of
Christmas', which had Jesus fighting Santa Claus over
the true' meaning of Christmas.  This short spawned
the animated phenomenon known as South Park.
Mere shock value' is a phrase that is often used to
describe the reason behind the popularity of their
program.  Perhaps the same words will be used by
critics to describe this picture.
    The problem with the term shock value', is that it
often suffocates the true comedic value and reduces the
picture to nothing more than outrageousness.  It's a
knee-jerk label that many easily offended people give
when viewing work that deals with subject matter that
they'drather not view.  This is fairly evident as the film
received an NC-17 (which would pretty much butcher it's
distribution potential, so it must be cut to make the R).
               However, despite the subjects Parker has
chosen to tackle as backdrops for his comedy, his wit
and originality is always present in all he's worked on
and hopefully will get noticed moreso than his subjects.
               The main strength of the comedy is its lack of
duds'.  Just about every joke Parker goes for works,
and every now and then he gets something that really'
works.  Few of those latter jokes could be described in this
review without lessening the impact of an actual viewing,
however one physical gag sticks out in my mind and
involves a character named T-RexThat is all I will say.
               An interesting Parker used a few actual porn stars
in the film, either as an inside joke for those of us who know
who Ron Jeremy (of Anal Al's Adventures fame) is, or to
instill an important sense of realism that can only be
achieved by porn stars playing porn stars.  Also adding
some Spice in the film is Chasey Lain and Boraca the
Brazilian Bombshell.
               The film has a simplicity about it, and perhaps that
is it's biggest forte.  Many comedies try to be big, with the
misconception that bigger is better, and while I'm sure many
actors in this film would hold that belief, it is my
experience that forced and unnecessary grandeur often
obscures pure comedy and its subtleties.  Then again,
perhaps the simplicity is due mainly to budget restraints
well, whatever the reasonit works.  It is not the most
satirical, nor the most intelligent script ever written, but it
did it's jobit was funny.  Parker obviously has confidence
in his work and sense of humor.  As a result, the pacing
never becomes flaccid.  It may be somewhat immature, it
may contain some mediocre choices in running gags, and
maybe an elderly lady humping her walker could be
considered in bad tastebut it's all in good fun.
               Another interesting character assignment is Dian
Bachar as Ben Chapleski (aka Choda Boy).  In Cannibal:
The Musical, Dian played a virgin whose main hope in life
was to get laid.  In Orgazmo, as Ben, Dian finally gets to
see some action.  Another character returning from
Cannibal is Masad "Maki" San, who impeccably portrays
G-Fresh...
               As a side-note, the hilarious theme song, `Now
You're a Man' is performed by Parker and Stone's band
DVDA (the meaning behind which will be explained within
the film.)
