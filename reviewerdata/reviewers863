Jackie stars as Chon Wang, a lesser Imperial Guard in the Forbidden
City of China. The royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is set to be
married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture.
Unwilling to follow her Father's wishes, Princess Pei Pei with the
assistance of her English tutor, decides to escape to America. But
this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard Lo Fong, which will lead to
the Princess' kidnapping and ransom.
Unable to take any legal action, the ransom demands are met and three
of the Forbidden City's bravest Guards (played by Cui Ya Hi, Rong
Guang Yu, and Eric Chen) are ordered to transport the ransom payment
to Lo Fong in Carson City, Nevada. Chon Wang pleads with the imperial
court and is given permission to join the team, as he is looked upon
as a buffoon.
On a train in the U.S. Jackie meets up with bandit Roy O'Bannon (Owen
Wilson). He is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog, looking
simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him.
With his gang in tow, Roy attempts to rob the train, when one of his
gang murders the Chinese interpreter of the Royal Court, who also
happens to be Chon Wang's uncle.
Chon Wang gives chase, foiling the attempted robbery, but also leaving
himself stranded in the desert. As the disgraced Guard wanders through
the desert, he again comes upon Roy, who has been left for dead by his
former gang. Buried up to his neck in the desert, Roy pleads with Chon
to dig him out. Chon demands to know where Carson City is. Roy directs
him, and Chon leaves. But not before sticking two chopsticks into
Roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself.
Chon soon finds himself confronted by angry Crow warriors, a friendly
Sioux tribe, gunslingers, a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog
and an Indian bride (Brandon Merrill), before once again running into
Roy.
"Shanghai Noon" is just good fun. The chemistry between the cast is
remarkable. The performances are all acceptable within the whimsical
levels of the film. Jackie's performance is as good as anything he's
done before. He's not called on to do much acting here, as the
character is not written with any depth. But Jackie's natural charisma
shines through, and his comic timing is so perfect, both physically
and (surprise) verbally that once again he commands the screen
whenever he is on.
Owen Wilson, last seen in the embarrassing remake of "The Haunting",
gives a good natured performance as Roy O'Bannon. His innocence is
refreshing and fun. A bad guy that's not really bad. His scenes with
Jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since Martin and
Lewis. Lucy Liu as Princess Pei Pei is given little to do in the
script, but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other
deviant. The character is a noble woman of status and wealth, but
finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment.
The rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances.
Nothing here is realistic, mind you. "Shanghai Noon" is first and
foremost a light, jovial film. And the performances match that style
with ease.
The Cinematography by Dan Mindel is gorgeous. Using Calgary, Alberta
as the prime location. Mr. Mindel is able to create a lush, romantic
western feel to the film. Nothing here really looks like Nevada, but
the locations are so beautifully shot and staged, the film can be
looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre. And as
such, the script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar plays fast and loose
with history, but with reverence to past films. Homage to such films
as "High Noon" (obviously), "Red River" and most notably "Butch
Cassidy & the Sundance Kid" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the
film. It is a comforting experience. At a time when the Western is
considered either old hat or irrelevant, here is a film that embraces
those old attitudes and (dare I say) clichés and manages to make them
palatable and refreshing. Here is a film that is not contemptuous of
the genre. This is the purest "horse opera" since the days of George
O'Brian or John Wayne.
Director Tom Dey has crafted a loving tribute to Hollywood's past. In
this, his first film Mr. Dey shows both a love of character and of
craftsmanship that is refreshing to see. Nothing here really stands
out, or takes one's attention away from the story or action. And that
is as it should be, when Jackie Chan is your star.
And what of the action and stunts. Well, while not up to a level of
"Drunken Master 2" or any of Jackie's Hong Kong films, "Shanghai Noon"
is miles ahead of anything Jackie has done in an American film before.
His timing, choreography, and creativity are still as sharp as ever.
Jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films
(obvious to those of us that have seen those films, but refreshingly
fun for those unfamiliar). Finally Jackie can honestly say, that he
has made an U.S., his way and incorporating his style.
To sum up, "Shanghai Noon" is a fun summer confection. Not too heavy
and not too light. A fun and entertaining film that the whole family
can enjoy (parents be advised there are scenes of smoking, drunkenness
and peyote use). An enjoyable and charming film that can and will be
enjoyed again and again.

Review for Deep Impact (1998)
PARAMOUNT PICTURES & DREAMWORKS SKG presents a Zanuck/Brown Production
of a Mimi Leder Film "DEEP IMPACT" Robert Duvall, Tia Leoni, Elijah
Wood, Vanessa Redgrave,
Maximilian Schell, Leelee Sobieski and Morgan Freeman. Cinematography by
Dietrich Lohmann,
Original Score by James Horner, Production Design by Leslie Dilley,
Edited by Paul Cichocki &
David Rosenbloom, Associate Producer:  D. Scott Easton, Executive
Producers:  Steven Spielberg,
Walter F. Parkes, Joan Bradshaw,  Produced by:  Richard D. Zanuck ,

Screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin & Michael Tolkin  Directed by  Mimi Leder
It's summer again. It's only obvious in that this is the time of year
when the studios pull out their big, effects laden productions and
attempt to coerce every young adult and teenager into a movie theater
for two hours of escapism. What's the big deal? Well, with the film
'Deep Impact' we have a combination effort, something that is at once a
big splashy effects picture and an emotional human drama. Unfortunately,
for those under the age of 17. The film deals with issues and ideas that
most young people could not concern themselves with.
On a dark night, a group of high school students are gathered on a
hillside stargazing for a science project. Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood)
spots something out of the ordinary and nonchalantly decides to send
along the information to Astrology researcher, Professor Wolf (Bob
Balaban). That information is identified as a comet, the size of New
York City (7 miles) which is on a collision course with Earth.
Continuing the story, Lenny Lerner (Tia Leoni), a struggling field
reporter for the MS/NBC cable news network; is chasing after a story
about the possible infidelities of Press Secretary Alan Rittenhouse
(James Cromwell). Lenny has received information through various sources
in Washington leading her to believe that the Press Secretary is having
an affair with a woman named Eli. Confronting Mr. Rittenhouse at his
boat (where he seems to be stockpiling supplies), Lenny questions him
about his affair. The confrontation leads Lenny to believe that she is
on the right track. It is at that moment that she is detained by the
secret service. She is taken to the White House, where she is question
as to what she knows of Eli. Realizing that she may be misunderstanding
the situation, Lenny researches the name Eli. She finally discovers that
it is an anagram for "Extinction Level Impact".
As stated at the top of this article, 'Deep Impact' is a unique film for
this time of year. Usually, films of this nature carry very little
weight story-wise. These films are usually high concept projects with
quick payoffs and predictable situations ('Daylight', 'Independence
Day', 'Volcano', etc.). While these films are entertaining in their own
right, you don't really expect anything in the way of depth from them.
This is what makes 'Deep Impact' so compelling and so disappointing. The
film takes time to develop its situation and it's characters. There is
an honest attempt at character depth here that is refreshing.
Nevertheless, at the same time, there is not enough. This film would
work better if it had an extra 30 minutes tagged onto it. Enough to give
us a chance to get to know all of these diverse individuals.
The performances in the film are nothing special, although Tia Leoni
deserves recognition for her fine turn as Reporter Lenny Lerner. She
gives us a solid view of a woman isolated from human contact and
consumed by her career until disaster strikes. Her drive and hard work
are rewarded, to the point of survival. The choices Lenny makes give the
character a marvelous arc and makes her the most believable portrayal in
the film.
Robert Duvall is always a joy to watch. His, Spurgeon Tanner, a retired
NASA astronaut and last man to walk on the moon, is a man who has
nothing else to live for. His wife has passed away; his sons are
essentially estranged from him. Tanner has only one thing left in his
life and that is his accomplishments. Taking the mission to attempt to
save the Earth, is a call to arms. A military man all of his life,
Tanner will risk his life to perform his duty. Moreover, he does it as a
testament to his wife.
The other performances in the film are all acceptable in their
individual performances. Maximilian Schell as Lenny's father Jason
Lerner, probably fairs worse in the film, as we are never really given a
chance to know the character. Morgan Freeman makes the most believable
On-Screen President since Ralph Bellamy in 'Sunrise at Capbobello'.
Vanessa Redgrave has a marvelous turn as Robin Lerner, recently divorced
and alone. Her portrayal of a woman unable to cope with her loneliness
is both pitiful and painful. The surprise performance of the film is
newcomer Leelee Sobieski as Sarah Hotchner. Her naturalness and depth of
emotion belay her mere 15 years of life. This is a young talent to
watch. While some have unflatteringly referred to her as Helen Hunt Jr.
(due to a slight resemblance), it's would be a shame if her ability was
neglected simply due to her physical traits.
The screenplay by noted writers Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin is
one of the most intelligent in recent years. Events are not telegraphed
as much as they are inevitable. There are serious attempts here to raise
the level of believability in the script. Logic prevails in all of the
situations. There are no heroic moments without cost. There is no
sacrifice without pain. No salvation without loss. This is the
antithesis of action films, and it is a welcome relief.
Mimi Leder handles the film well enough. There are moments, that have a
television drama look to them, little flourishes that almost get in the
way of the drama. This is not problematic, just distracting. Ms. Leder
shows real talent in handling her actors. Every performance is keyed to
a fine note.
This brings up the disappointing part of the whole enterprise. Also,
with so many characters and sub plots, the film has the same disjointed
feel of every other dissater epic. There are also moments when knowing
asides are used as comic relief. This has the effect of diminishing the
drama. While a little humor would be acceptable, lines such as "Don't
worry so much, it's not the end of the world." are just too noticeable.
In addition, some of the emotional grandstanding towards the climax of
the film rings false. It's just a little too maudlin for it's own good.
This also brings up the Lenny's final acceptance of her fate. It's
developed so quickly that it doesn't ring true.
'Deep Impact' is a fine film, and one that may linger in memory longer
that one would expect. There are moments, which are emotionally
powerful. Moreover, there are political ideas brought to fore that are
uncomfortable. It's flaws, while not as cumbersome as other films, are
still distracting.
On a scale from * to *****, 'Deep Impact' rates ***=.

Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
Produced by:  WCG Entertainment Productions         Distributed by: Sony
Pictures Entertainment
Staring: Yun-Fat Chow (John Lee), Mira Sorvino (Meg Coburn), Michael
Rooker (Stan Zedkov), J|rgen Prochnow (Wei's Right Hand Man), Kenneth
Tsang (Mr. Wei), Steven Garcia, Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez, Patrick
Kilpatrick, Frank Medrano, Til Schweiger, Danny Trejo
Produced by Brad Grey, Bernie Brillstein. Co-Producer: Michael
McDonnell. Executive Producers: Terence Chang, Christopher Godsick,
Matthew Baer, John Woo. Score by Harry Gregson-Williams, Edited by Jay
Cassidy. Cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister. Screenplay by Ken
Sanzel, Directed by Antoine Fuqua
It happened with Jackie Chan and John Woo. It happened with Director
Ringo Lam. It even happened with Hong Kong's answer to Steven Spielberg,
Tsui Hark. Hong Kong filmmakers making their first projects for
Hollywood are having a hard time finding projects worthy of their
talents. Columbia / Tri-Stars latest release of "THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS" is unfortunately no exception to this trend.
The plot opens with a stake-out, let by Detective Stan Zedkov (Michael
Rooker -'Harry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', 'Rosewood') to capture
Chinese drug lord, Wei Tong. Things go bad when the gangsters are tipped
off by the early arrival of a police helicopter. A shoot out ensues,
ending with Tong being killed by Detective Zedkov. 
This sets up the films multi-layered revenge plot. At the funeral for
his son, Triad Boss, Mr. Wei confronts Det. Zedkov. Zedkov defends his
actions by saying that "Tong had made his own choice". Mr. Wei counters,
saying  "Some choices are out of our hands." 
John Lee (Chow Yun-fat) is brought in to perform a hit in retaliation
against the Detective. John is a cold and calculated assassin. A man
"who is perfect in his work". John is not an assassin by choice. He is
in servitude to Mr. Wei for some undisclosed debt. John is told that
after this last job, his debt will be paid in full.
John takes the job, but with a sense of reservation. Positioning himself
on a hillside near the Detective's home, John assembles his weapon. He
sights his target.. but finally cannot bring himself to perform the hit,
his eyes reddening with anguish and guilt, (an absolutely marvelous
piece of physical acting, done without the use of optical effects).
This act of defiance sets John at odds with his boss. Mr. Wei orders
that John and his family in China, be killed. John is now a fugitive
from both the law and the lawless. He arranges to meet with a person who
can supply him with a fake passport so that he can leave the country and
return to China in an effort to protect his Mother and Sister. He meets
with Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), a young woman who has made a living on
the opposite side of the law. She is now a forger, expert in creating
false ID's. Unfortunately, John has been traced to her hideout. A
blazing gun-fight erupts, with Meg and John forming an uncomfortable
alliance.
"The Replacement Killers" is one of the more visually stunning films to
come out of a major Hollywood Studio since the '60's. The look of the
film is sumptuous. Almost every frame is a painting, with diffused and
bold colors used to infuse scenes with emotion and mood. Unfortunately,
the film itself is void of those same qualities. Not to take anything
away from the film, the film is generally entertaining. The problem is,
is that there is an emotional distance in the film. There is no feeling
of dread, no feeling of threat, no sense of danger. It's almost as if we
were watching a music video. Director Antoine Fuqua is a marvelous
stylist, his handling of the visual look of the film and his staging of
action scenes is very promising. The film has a tempo and a rhythm that
is remarkable in and of itself. But that also serves to point out the
films biggest failing, his handling of his actors is almost
non-existent. 
Mr. Chow is a marvel to watch .You haven't seen this kind of screen
presents since Steve McQueen. Every time Chow Yun-fat is on screen, your
eyes immediately lock on him. His style and screen presents is the most
riveting thing in the film. No one handles a gun with more flair. Chow
Yun-fat has the grace of Gene Kelly. For the first time in an American
film, you believe that using two guns at once is physically possible.
While having been a major star in Asia for the past 15 years, the U.S.
has not really had the chance to experience this fine actor. It is a
testament to his talent and ability that the film is as captivating as
it is. 
Ms. Sorvino is poorly represented in the film. The character of Meg
Coburn is bereave of any development. She has no arc to her. That is
purely the fault of the script, which places more meaning on the action
than on the characters. But it is still a shame that as talented an
actress as Sorvino can be wasted like this. The scenes between Chow and
Sorvino have a forced, almost staged quality, there is no chemistry
between them. Chow Yun-fat's rescue of Sorvino during a car wash
shoot-out is remarkably forced, as he has no reason to save her life
other than to get his forged passport. There must obviously, be others
in Los Angeles that can perform that duty, so the reasoning behind the
rescue is sorely lacking.
Michael Rooker as Det. Zedkov is given the most ridiculous and out of
place facial hair that any law enforcement officer has ever had. Det.
Zedkov would look more at home being one of the hired assassins that
being an officer of the law. His character is also giving short shift by
the script. We know nothing about his character other than he is a
Detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, and that he has a son
that he adores. While we do see his wife (through the scope of Chow
Yun-fat's rifle) we are not introduced to her, therefore we are given
nothing to identify with. Det. Zedkov becomes a character servicing the
plot, nothing more.
Kenneth Tsang ('The Killer', 'Supercop') as Mr. Wei carries his role as
well as can be expected. All the script gives us is a man of immoral
power and corruption. Again, we know nothing about this man; why he is
respected or feared, what his exact illegal business is, and why as a
Triad leader, he has hired so many Europeans to work for him. J|rgen
Prochnow is completely wasted in the role of Wei's Enforcer. His
character is so lacking in development that he doesn't even have a name
(no one in the film calls him by name, unless his name is YOU!).
Going back to the look of the film. Cinematically, the film has a grand
an expressive feel. The use of color to dictate the emotion of the film
is nicely developed. The Cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister is
remarkable, and the sole essence of the film to show depth and
character. With a more developed script and more character development,
this technique would have giving us possibly the first post forties
'film noir'. 
The basic plot of the film has the makings of a fascinating crime drama.
The family loyalty / revenge motif that runs through the film is
interesting and should have been fully developed. The idea of taking
revenge against another by taking the lives of their loved ones is a
powerful plot construct. The most glaring disappointment is that John
Lee's family is only identified by a faded photograph. There are no
conversations with the family via phone or letter, no feeling that John
is alone in a foreign land. While it's possible to accept that John Lee
is a man who accepts his fate, the film does little to inform us of
that. 
All said, 'The Replacement Killers' is only a serviceable action film.
It supplies the requisite gunfights, car chases and explosions one
expects from the genre. But the lack of tension and drama severely
hamper the film, leaving one with the feeling that they've only seen
half of a finished film.
Rated **1/2 out ***** stars. A disappointing debut from Chow Yun-fat,
but one that does leave you wanting to see more.

Review for Six-String Samurai (1998)
Palm Pictures & Overseas FilmGroup, Inc. Presents an HSX Films
production of a Lance Mungia Film.
Jeff Falcon   "SIX STRING SAMURAI"  Justin McGuire, Stephane Gauger,
John Sarkisian, Gabrille Pimenter
Edited by James Frisa    Music by Brian Tyler    Cinematography by
Kristian Bernier     Visual Effects by: Pixel Envy

Lance Mungia
Screenplay by Jeffrey Falcon & Lance Mungia   Produced by Leanna

Every so often in this industry, there is a project or talent that
creates a buzz. The title of that project takes on a mystique that
drives it through the rounds of dinner -talk, industry screenings and so
forth and so on. Occasionally these little films live up to their hype,
but most time they do not. For every good film screened at film
festivals around the country, hundreds may never see release outside of
a direct to video release. With the upcoming release of Lance Mungia's
"Six String Samurai", filmgoers are in for a rare and delectable treat.
The plot is a complete fabrication, creating its our history for it's
bizarre plot. In 1957, World War 3 has broken out. The last surviving
outpost of civilization is LOST VEGAS (!). The leader of the free world
is Elvis (the KING!). Our story picks up forty years later. The King is
dead and the quest is on for a new King. Every Rock and Roller with a
guitar from across the country makes their way to Lost Vegas to claim
the throne. One of these guitar-carrying warriors is a Rastafarian
looking heavy metal guitarist known as Death. He is systematically
killing off rivals to the throne. The other is Buddy (Jeff Falcon), who
carries his samurai sword, duck taped to the back of electric guitar.
Buddy is a man of few words. But, his actions speak volumes. But his
journey takes a decided turn when an 8-year-old boy joins him.
 "Six String Samurai" is without a doubt one of the most original and
thoroughly surprising films of the past decade. While the plot is rather
episodic and slow at points the film more than makes up for it with its
goofy charm. This is film that not everyone will enjoy, but neither was
it meant to. 'Six String Samurai' comes from the same subversive
attitude that gave us such marvelous independent epics as 'Death Race
2000', 'Repo Man', 'Vanishing Point', and even 'Faster Pussycat, Kill,
Kill'.
The film belies its low budget origins by using some of the most
dazzling cinematography since 'The English Patient'. Kristian Bernier's
camera work is inspired. Death Valley has not looked this mystical and
majestic since John Ford. Almost every scene shines like a frame from a
David Lean epic. This is no faint praise. Considering what resources Mr.
Bemier had to work with, we are witnesses to a vital and wondrous new
talent. His work here rivals Dean Cundey's (Jurassic Park, Escape from
New York) best in terms of pure cinematic magic.
Director Lance Mungia carries the film with a flair that brings to mind
such diverse talent as Russ Meyer, Paul Bartell, and even John
Carpenter. Being his first feature film, it does have a raw edge, but
that edge gives this film a comedic drive that is sourly lacking from
the majority of films today. It would be a shame to see this talented
individual dropped into the direct to video market. The script for "Six
String Samurai' while being episodic, plays like a peyote inspired road
picture. There are moments of pure comedic joy in this film, with laugh
out loud hilarity. The action set pieces are staged and executed with a
style that is exhilarating. At a time when Hollywood is aping everything
from Hong Kong filmmakers, its refreshing to find a film that tries to
create it's own style. Yes, there are moments of Wu Shu style martial
arts, but they are used sparingly. The weapon of choice here is the
sword (as one character points out late in the film "We havent had
bullets since 1959"). So many techniques and styles are used in filming
the fight scenes that some of the references may be lost on most film
historians. You can be certain; you will see loving tributes to both
Akira Kurosawa, and Kenji Misumi (Lone Wolf & Cub).
Jeff Falcon, who plays Buddy (Holly?), has made a career in Hong Kong
working on over 15 films. Including "Inspector Wore Skirts." where he
had the fortune of getting whacked on the head with a Chinese pole by
Wei Yin Hung (My Young Auntie /1980). His performance in 'Six String
Samurai' is a caricature of the Sergio Leone "Man Without A Name"
anti-hero. Now playing the part of a man carrying a Gibson 335 guitar,
wearing Bifocals taped in the centerpiece, trudging across the desert
wastes is as daunting a performance as one can possibly imagine. While
the character of Buddy is written as an enigma, Mr. Falcon brings a
comic sensibility to the performance that is charmingly refreshing. But,
what we really what to see are the fight scene. Any film that has its
hero carrying a Samurai Sword had better have some fight scene. And
fight scenes it has. Copious fights scenes. Each one more inventive than
the one preceding it. Mr. Falcon may be the best screen fighter in the
U.S. since Charles Bronson in 'Hard Times' (1975).
The only week part of the film is the performance by Justin McGuire as
THE KID. While the performance is not necessarily bad, it is
indifferent. Since this is Mr. McGuire's first film, this can be excused
as just inexperience. However, Justin McGuire does exude a charm in some
scenes that contradicts his inexperience. Not having much dialogue in
this film, Mr. McGuire has to communicate with his eyes and body
language, which he does well.
To end up, "Six String Samurai" is a joyous celebration of movie making
by a team of filmmakers that were hell-bent on creating something unique
and special. It would be lest than flattering to say that they have
succeeded.
On a scale of ***** "Six String Samurai" rates ***=.  A charming example
of guerrilla filmmaking, And a loving tribute to a form of cinema that
has been missing for far too long.

"Man and Woman are together at first, but once
they come to Earth, they spend forever looking for
each other" That sentiment begins the journey of
Goldie Bu (Shi Qi), a young girl from Taiwan. She
is an adventurous young woman raised by her
restaurant owner parents. One afternoon, a young
fisherman Long Yi (Richard Yam Yin-chai) proposes
to Bu. Bu is amused, but she is not attracted to
the young man. Speaking with her Mother (Elaine
Jin), Bu is told the true meaning of love, that
you can watch the person you love regardless of
what they do, and still feel comfortable and
thrilled.
On the Island, Bu has an unusual friend in a
school of dolphins. One morning she confesses her
feelings of Long Yi to one of the Dolphins. It is
then that she finds a bottle floating near the
dock. Inside is a note, which reads "I'm waiting
for You.. Albert". Bu is intrigued and excited by
the message, half believing that the message may
be meant for her. Bu decides to leave for Hong
Kong to search for her Prince Charming.
Arriving in Hong Kong, Bu meets up with Albert.
But, no romance is in the offing as Albert admits
to being gay and that the note was meant for his
ex-boyfriend. He demands that Bu leave and return
to Taiwan.  Bu is heartbroken. Being soft hearted,
Albert agrees to let Bu stay with him for a while,
turning her quest for romance into a vacation.
Albert is a high class make-up artist and
photographer. Bu becomes his assistant. One
morning while out at sea photographing some
models, Bu meets up with C.N. Chan (Jackie Chan) a
high powered business man and stock market player.
Bu rescues C.N. from an attack by L.W. (Emil
Chow), C.N.'s business and lifelong rival. C.N.
mistakes Bu for a Vietnamese girlfriend of a
powerful Hong Kong mobster, and Bu  goes along
with the charade in a chance to win his heart.
With Albert's help, Bu stages a naively conceived
attack by some (obviously fey) gangsters. C.N.
comes to her rescue, and the romance begins. C.N.
is being confronted continually by his nemesis
L.W. leading to a fight with an Australian fighter
who beats C.N. mercilessly. Bu consoles C.N. after
his loss, and convinces him that he needs to have
more fun. C.N. agrees, and the two start to have
many romantic and fun days together.
It is when C.N. finally confronts Bu with his
knowledge of her charade. Bu leaves unable to cope
with C.N.'s manner. She refuses to be just another
girlfriend to this playboy. C.N. musses, his own
life coming into focus. It is when he is forced to
fight again that C.N. realizes his growing
affection for Bu.
Vincent Kok's 'Gorgeous' is a wonderfully wispy
romantic comedy. This film is as light as anything
one can remember. The films goodhearted nature and
charm come as much from the ensemble cast as it
does from its premise. Shu Qi is absolutely
charming as the innocent girl Bu. Her natural
beauty and infectious smile light up the screen.
Shu plays the character of Bu as a complete
innocent and keeps her that way. While her
character does mature, her innocents remains
intact.
Tony Leung Chiu-wai is hilarious as Albert. A gay
man who sees in Bu a sense of romance that he has
long forgotten. His growing fondness for her,
becoming protective and nurturing. Mr. Leung
deserves credit for making such a minor character
so memorable and endearing. Kudos also should be
given to Richard Yam Yin-chai in his first film.
His portrayal of Long Yi is ripe with marvelous
comic timing. His insolent romanticism  is so
perfect that one can't help but be amused. One
marvelously timed comedic scene has Long Yi in
Albert's apartment (after following Bu to Hong
Kong), drunk and demanding more wine. Bu having
stumbled onto the scene, hides in the
refrigerator. Albert must try to keep Bu from
freezing or suffocation while hiding her from Long
Yi, who stumbles around the kitchen looking for
sake.
And what can be said about Jackie Chan in his
first romantic lead. Well, Chan is up to the
challenge. His charming and disarming smile is on
display for much of the film. His warmth and
growing attachment to Bu is honest and believable.
C.N. is a man who has everything, but the one
thing he misses most is his innocent. With Bu, he
is able to find it. Jackie plays the part of C.N.
as a man of high morals and low aspirations, a
wonderful contradiction of modern day Hong Kong.
He does not attack his enemies as much as punish
them in ways that would make them see the errors
of their ways. Jack's moral that honor and respect
are more important than personal gain is charming
and welcomed.
The rest of the cast is all wonderfully played.
While some characterizations may seem a little
broad, it still seems natural. People with this
much passion could not behave in any other way.
The standout performance of this cast is by Sung
yung-chen, who plays Bu's Father. His boisterous
and blustery character is beautifully played.
Vincent Kok has managed to create a marvelously
charming love story in "Gorgeous". The characters
and situations are rise organically, never seeming
to be placed there for the short sell. While the
basic idea is  convoluted and trite, it works
within the context of the characters. Yes, Bu
would fly off to Hong Kong to find her Prince
Charming without knowing who he is. That is what
her character is, a true romantic. The
cinematography by Man Po-cheung is sumptuous as is
the art direction by Yee Chung-man. The look of
the film is also charming and warm. While some of
the editing is a little abrupt, it is not enough
to detract from the film, and only becomes
noticeable in two short scenes.
And of course everyone will want to know about the
fight scenes. Well, they are fantastically
entertaining. Jackie has managed to do something
in this film that he has never done before. He
actually loses both of the main fights. But while
the first fight almost breaks his spirit, the
second restores it. Brad Allen who plays the
Australian fighter is frightening good. Being
shorter than Chan by 6 inches, his kicks and
punches belay his size, making him one of Jackie's
most formidable opponents. What is most amusing
about the fight scenes is that there is nothing
mean spirited about them. Both men respect one
another and treat each other accordingly. The
admonition by Bradley of "No rules, but no dirty
tricks" is carried throughout the film. These
characters are all honorable men caught in the
service of a dishonorable society. It is through
the fight scenes that Jackie's character does
indeed become a Prince Charming. Even as he loses,
he loses with his honor and his spirit intact.
'Gorgeous' is just that. A wonderfully candy
colored romance that leaves the viewer charmed and
uplifted.
A fitting film for Jackie to end the decade on.
And a marvelous preview of a group of talented
individuals who, I for one look forward to seeing
again.
On a side note.. The film was just purchased for
U.S. distribution by Sony Pictures Entertainment
(Columbia / Tri-star). So expect to see a dubbed
version sometime next year either theatrically on
debuting on HBO.
