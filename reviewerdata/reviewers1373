Title
Review for Other Sister, The (1999)
This film is totally delightful.  Juliette Lewis is excellent as
the mentally disabled Carla Tate, who has recently returned home
after years in a home for disabled youngsters.  From the moment
she returns home, she is on a quest for independence and proves
that she is willing to do anything to get it.  Her life takes a
totally different turn when she meets Danny (Giovanni Ribisi)
while attending vocational school.
They fall in love and much of the movie focuses on her efforts to
convince her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), that she is no longer
a little girl but a grown up woman with the same hopes and dreams as
other women her age.
Keaton is excellent in her role of the overprotective mother
who means well but who can't seem to stop trying to control the
lives of her three daughters or to get over her guilt of sending
Laura away to school.  Tom Skerritt is also good as Laura's
father who has somehow managed to stay sane despite a bout with
alcoholism and dealing with a controlling and guilt ridden wife.
Ribisi is great as Danny who is more in touch with his emotions
and life than most people who are not mentally disabled.
Both he and Lewis are uninhibited in their roles which allows for
many of the enjoyable and, oftentimes, humorous scenes in the
film.  This movie is definitely well worth seeing.
