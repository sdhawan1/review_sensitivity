"You guys, as a gender, will have to get a grip, while the future of
the human race is looking down."
So mouths Rosie while grocery shopping, bearing down supermarket
aisles with Tommy and Willie trailing sheepishly.
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is a smart funny movie about a group of high-school
buddies in a small town who can't make up their minds about women.
It's a male-bonding flick, but as my girlfriends and I smugly
conclude, it's really a devastating indictment of men--their
insecurities, their refusal to grow up, and hence all the pain they
put women through.
There are several categories of men in this movie. Check which one
your boyfriend/ex-boyfriend falls under.
Tommy is a broodingly delectable specimen of a man. He is also
sleeping with his already-married high school sweetheart AND his
long-suffering, anorexic girlfriend. He knows he's being a jerk, but
he hasn't gotten over high school. He just can't make a choice--or
stick by it.
b) The sad sod with supermodel posters on his bedroom wall
The classic 'you don't know what you got till it's gone' syndrome.
Paul realizes he loves his gal--after ending their relationship and
finding out she's seeing someone else. He alternates between jealous
fits and trying to win her back. Why he broke up with her in the first
place? The "promise" of something better, like one of the supermodels
on his wall coming to life.
c) He's got it all, but he wants the neighbourhood Lolita
Willie has a beautiful talented girlfriend, but now she's talking
marriage and he doesn't know what he wants. So he returns to his
hometown to find himself, and he finds himself falling for his
thirteen year old next door neighbour.
What it takes to shake these men up: a beautiful girl like Andera
(played babeliciously by Uma Thurman) walking into their lives and
telling them how great it is to be in a long-term relationship. And
that is just what happens. Each of them tries to date the visiting
Andera, only to find that all she needs is her man back home. And it
makes them rethink their own relationships.
Of course, unlike my cynical little diatribe, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS does all
the above with humour and compassion. Memorable moments abound: the
teasing, witty interplay between Timothy Hutton's Willie and beautiful
Natalie Portman as Marty; the confusion, indecision and impatience of
Matt Dillon's Tommy.
My favourite is Rappaport's Paul, the screwball who talks too much and
feels too late, who blunders pig-headedly into his ex-girlfriend's
life proposing marriage, retreating finally into his supermodel shrine
of a bedroom to pick up the pieces.
But ultimately, what stands out is the touching way in which a movie
about men comes out on the side of its women. In the words of Tommy
(realizing pathetically how much girlfriend Sharon means to him after
being battered by lover Darian's husband), "Why do we always fuck up
the good ones?"
And BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, to quote its most eloquent character Paul, takes
us women "behind the curtain" to show just how much it takes for men
to commit.
THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.
