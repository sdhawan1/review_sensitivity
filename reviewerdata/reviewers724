Title
Review for Motorama (1992)
     MOTORAMA is a 1991 comedy written by Joseph Minion and directed by
Barry Shils.  It is such a charming little movie, I wonder why I had
never heard of it before.
     The star is Jordan Christopher Michael as Gus, a ten-year-old on
the road.  (His previous credits are two made-for-TV movies.)  We see
Gus's (dare I say it?) quirky adventures as he travels.  But where is
it?  It seems (at first) to be the western rural USA (it was filmed in
California and Arizona); but after a while we see from the details that
it is not.  Maybe it is some future time, or some alternate USA, or
perhaps just some generic place dreamed up for the movie.  It might be
interesting to take the states Gus visits, and see if they can be
identified as corresponding to real places.
     Many of the small roles, people Gus meets along the way, are
played by well-known actors, including: Drew Barrymore, Dick Miller,
Vince Edwards (as a doctor of course), Michael J. Pollard, Jack Nance,
Charles Tyner, and Robert Picardo.  But don't get the movie to see
these actors, because each of them is only briefly on screen.  Writer
Joseph Minion's previous film AFTER HOURS is also quirky in its own
way, but I liked MOROTRAMA much more.
     Unexpected things happen to Gus along the way.  The ending is a
bit peculiar, and it left me smiling, wanting to see more.  If you like
strange movies, try this one.  MOTORAMA is rated R, presumably for
language: the sex and violence could be easily PG-13.
