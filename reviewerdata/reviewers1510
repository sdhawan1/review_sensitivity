Title
Review for Drunks (1997)
Director: Peter Cohn (debut)
A cast of dozens including Richard Lewis, Faye Dunaway, Dianne Wiest,
Spalding Gray, Howard Robbins, Christopher Lawford, and George Martin.
     This film debuted tonight at the Boston Film Festival, on the
heels of a glowing review by the Boston Globe's Jay Carr.  I can't
concur--I found it a self-conscious actor's movie--pretty much like
watching an audition tape.
     If you're not afraid of spoilers, here's what happens: There's an
AA meeting, at which each member tells their story.  Richard Lewis'
character goes first, then takes off and goes on a binge.  That's
it--that is literally the entire movie.  There's nothing here but the
barest of frameworks for a bunch of (admittedly talented) actors to
give their individual interpretations of alcoholism.  Each story is
told as a monologue, with no connection to the rest of the film, and no
relationships developed between characters (wait, that's an exaggeration
- two of them did talk for a minute in the women's room).  Each actor
works in isolation, which makes it impossible to forget for a moment
that you're watching actors performing rather than flesh-and-blood
characters.  You could extract each monologue from the film into a
distinct short, and watching neither the short or the film would you
ever guess there was anything missing (other than interest).
Plot - non-existent
Cinematography - yawn
Acting - generally forced and self-conscious, a waste of some talented
people (only Spalding Gray seems to know how to make an isolated
monologue ring true)
