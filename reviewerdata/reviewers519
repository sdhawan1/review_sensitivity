Review for Twister (1996)
_Jurassic Park_, but like, it doesn't suck
4 of 4 stars; only the stuffy would complain
The pitch: "It'll be like _Jurassic_Park_ meets Speed!"
        I did not go into _Twister_ with unreasonable expectations. I 
just wanted to be entertained. Then the picture came up on the screen, 
the wind blew me back in my seat, and I embarked on the greatest 
thrill-ride of a movie since _Speed_ or _Natural_Born_Killers_. 
_Twister_ is so real and powerful and, above all, entertaining, that to 
complain that the story is a little hokey or the characters said cliched 
lines is a fundamental misunderstanding of the film. It's tornadoes, man!
        Comparing _Twister_ to _Jurassic_Park_ is very valid. Michael 
Crichton wrote both films, and they both feature "stars" who were 
completely computer-generated. Steven Spielberg produced both films, as 
well. There was a lot which disappointed me about _Jurassic_Park_, 
however. For one thing, all of the characters were so annoying that I 
kept wishing for them all to die. Also, and I know this is a completely 
nonsensical thing to say, but I just could not appreciate the effects 
much at all. Sure, they were impressive, but I mean, so is a Van Gogh; I 
do not want to spend two hours sitting in front of a movie screen with a 
Van Gogh on it. There has to be an emotional involvement and an 
effective visual use of effects to really impress. For instance, I 
thought the most effective use of effects in _Jurassic_Park_ was when the 
cow is lowered into the cage and is ripped apart offscreen. The noises 
were great. They conveyed everything that needed to be conveyed. Another 
good scene was when Wayne Knight's character, attempting to smuggle DNA 
off the island, was killed by the poison-shooting dinosaur. I think that 
was an animatronic dinosaur, though. So why was I watching a movie? I 
could have been home on my couch listening to the radio or watching 
"Muppets Tonight!" I wished I was home on my couch listening to the 
radio or watching "Muppets Tonight!" Maybe tonight I will stay home on 
my couch and listen to the radio or watch "Muppets Tonight!"
        Or maybe I will go see _Twister_ again. Because, brother, does Jan 
de Bont, the director who brought us _Speed_, and the cinematographer who 
brought us _Cujo_, _Die_Hard_, and _The_Hunt_for_Red_October_, know how to 
make a movie that is exciting, gripping, and roundhouse-punch 
scary. When I saw _Speed_ for the first time, I was actually dodging and 
jumping in my seat and swearing out loud. (This can be very annoying to 
those seated around you. Be forwarned. _Twister_ is such a panic-inducing 
movie.)
        Jack N. Green, _Twister_'s cinematographer and Clint Eastwood's 
for the gorgeous _Unforgiven_ and _Bridges_of_Madison County_, pulls off 
some truly amazing helicopter shots and shots that require expert 
timing. He also photographs nature with such an unerring eye that you 
see the movie as a landscape of plains which intersects in an eerily 
beautiful way with the deadly power of nature as manifested by the 
tornadoes. You always feel that what is happening on screen is moving 
toward you, like your feet are on the ground with the characters, as well.
        I guess I will give a brief plot summary. The plot does not 
really matter. The plot is just an excuse for a bunch of tornadoes and 
destruction. This is a good thing. I do not want to be bothered with 
emotional baggage or following the intricacies of some loser's backstory. 
I want to see something get knocked over. de Bont comes through for me. 
So anyway, there are these storm-chasers, see, they want to find out how 
a tornado works, because nobody really knows, so they design "Dorothy" a 
machine that enters the eye of a tornado (they have to place it the 
tornado's path, of course) and releases hundreds of tiny sensors, which 
then record and transmit detailed information back to the scientists' 
computers. Bill (Bill Paxton) designed Dorothy, but he has left the 
project, and his wife Jo (Helen Hunt) for a new job as a weatherman and a 
new life with his fiancee, Melissa (Jami Gertz). Of course, on a trek out 
to get Jo to sign the divorce papers, Bill gets sucked back in with the 
old crew. Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah. Then there is this evil 
corporate storm-chaser, Jonas (Cary Elwes), who has stolen the design of 
Dorothy and is looking to get his findings completed before the other 
group. A rare storm configuration has presented some unique opportunities 
for study, so the race is on between the two groups to place and operate 
their machine first. Sound stupid? It is. Don't think about it too much. 
Unlike in _Jurassic_Park_, de Bont has the good sense to treat the human 
characters like what they are: bit players. There is almost no 
manipulative crap to try and get you to care while you are just waiting 
for the next cool effect.
        Who can think anyway with a big tornado barreling toward you, 
swirling and roiling with debris and dust and who knows? hellfire and a 
kind of cruel intelligent mindlessness that Spielberg wishes his dippy 
velociraptors had had for one second? Who needs to? Probably some idiot 
movie critic. But if you are looking for a movie that is a movie in every 
full, complete sense of the word, the kind of movie you can watch with 
popcorn on Saturday afternoon, _Twister_ is it. It is a four-star action 
picture, a four-star disaster picture, and that adds up to a four-star 
picture.

Review for James and the Giant Peach (1996)
The pitch: "It'll be like _The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_ meets 
_The_Muppets_Take_Manhattan_!"
        When Tim Burton's _The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_ was released, 
critics raved and gushed, loving the wonderful music by Danny Elfman, the 
ingenious story by Tim Burton, and the intriguing, dark, visually 
stunning stop-motion of Henry Selick. It was compared with _The_Cabinet_ 
_of_Dr._Caligari_, _The_Wizard_of_Oz_, and other fantastic classics of the 
screen. Recent re-viewings certainly show that the film is holding up 
under this pressure, and is one of those films that so captures a wide 
audience's imagination that it is an "instant classic." (Disney writes 
this under the titles of all its animated features; it has not quite been 
true since _Aladdin_.)
        The point of this introduction is to dispel any notion among 
those who are interested in seeing _James_and_the_Giant_Peach_ that it is 
another wonderful concoction in which Elfman, Burton, and Selick put 
their heads together to create a modern classic. This is not to 
denigrate the film at all. But if anyone is expecting a film remotely 
similar to some idea of _Tim_Burton's_The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_Part_ 
_II:_The_Revenge_, there is a large disappointment waiting at the theater.
        Some have referred to the film congratulating Burton on his dark, 
startling imagery, commenting on his trademark techniques and story 
features, and his unique vision. But with _James_, as with the horrendous 
summer disaster _Batman_Forever_, any credit or blame that is assignable to 
Burton is as a producer, not a director or creative consultant. The 
vision, the story, the style--all belong to Henry Selick, and he is due 
all the credit for the success of _James_.
        As you can probably tell from the title, if you have not already 
read the ubiquitous Roald Dahl book upon which this film is based, it is 
the story of a young boy, James Henry Trotter (Paul Terry), and his 
adventures with a giant peach. If you don't want more of a basic plot 
set-up than that, you should probably skip the next paragraph.
        James is trapped in a horrible life with his aunts Spiker (Joanna 
Lumley of the BBC's fabulous _Absolutely_Fabulous_ and former Bond girl) 
and Sponge (Miriam Margolyes) when he is approached by "The Old Man" 
(Pete Postlethwaite), who offers him a sack of magic squirmy things 
which, he promises, will change everything. James drops the sack, 
however, and the squirmy things work their magic on a bunch of garden 
bugs and a peach tree, which produces a giant-sized peach. Magically, 
James is transformed into a stop-motion character and enters the peach to 
find the giant-sized bugs, who become his fast friends by the time the 
peach rolls down the hill and their journey begins.
        Okay, no more spoilers, you can read on now. Excellent 
performances are given by nearly everyone in the film, though the 
live-action parts are the weakest and much of that is due to Lumley and 
Margolyes as the evil aunts. Paul Terry is a good actor, though, and he 
rescues the end of the movie with sheer enthusiasm. During the 
stop-motion middle of the film, the voices of the characters are provided 
by Susan Sarandon as Miss Spider, Simon Callow as Old Green Grasshopper, 
_Frasier_'s Glynis Johns as the Ladybug, David Thewlis as Earthworm, 
Richard Dreyfuss as Caterpillar and Margolyes as Glowworm. Sarandon, 
especially, adds a mystery and menace remarkable for a completely vocal 
performance. Dreyfuss is largely wasted. His awkward, loud Brooklyn 
accent could have been done better by any number of actors and come off 
as less annoying.
        There is the sense, as well, that this is a very abridged, 
musicalized version of Dahl's book, and this is true. It means that much 
of the delightful conversation from the book is cut, minimizing the 
characterization of the bugs and so a lot of the emotional impact. It's 
not a fatal flaw, but it is a flaw. Also, there is a storytelling 
incompleteness: there should probably have been one more big stop-motion 
adventure episode to "round out" the structure. If you have not read the 
book, you should probably see the film first and then appreciate how much 
richer the book is. If you have read the book, do not hold the movie to 
the book's strictures.
        But what really stuns about _James_ are the visuals. The landscape 
is totally believable during the stop-motion segments (the live-action 
sets are less so). Combining computer animation, blue-screen effects, 
stop-motion, and live-action, _James_ is sometimes blindingly 
good-looking. Where it falls down is in trying to make the live-action 
setting recall the stop-motion setting. Selick solves this problem by 
ignoring it, to the detriment of the film.
        _James_ ultimately is a success, but for reasons much different 
than those which made _Nightmare_ a success. While it is true that _James_ 
is much darker than the usual children's movie, it is nowhere near the 
dark vision of _Nightmare_. This film also succeeds largely in spite of 
its music, while _Nightmare_ was decidedly a musical. In the end, the two 
films are so dissimilar that too much comparison is pointless. This film 
is Selick's vision while _Nightmare_ was clearly Burton's.
        A couple of things to look for: one character from _The_Nightmare_ 
_Before_Christmas_ does briefly return, but it is not nearly as cheesy as 
that little sentence makes it sound. And stay after the credits: it's 
not hard since Randy Newman's catchiest tune of the movie, "Good News," 
is playing, and there is a short live-action bit at the end of the movie 
which, though not brilliant, is worth staying for since the ticket has 
already been bought.

Review for Primal Fear (1996)
3 of 4 stars; solid but not exceptional
The pitch: "It'll be like _The_Firm_ meets _American_Gigolo_!"
        What can you expect from a legal thriller? Well, if you go by the 
John Grisham-genre standard, not much courtroom action at all. I enjoyed 
_The_Firm_, _The_Pelican_Brief_ (which not many people know is a sequel to 
_All_the_President's_Men_ with Denzel Washington in the Redford role and 
Julia Roberts in the Dustin Hoffman role), and _The_Client_, but there is 
something distinctly anti-lawyer about them. Maybe it is because Grisham 
was fed up with lawyers during his career as one, maybe he is just 
matching the national mood. His heroes are always new to the legal system 
and forced through events to "take it on," of course, always triumphing 
in the end.  The plots are tight and have explosions and fights and danger.
        Not to complain too much, but _Primal_Fear_ is certainly not a 
well-plotted movie. The pacing, the acting, the mood, are all sustained, 
but the actual events of the story may leave you feeling used and a bit 
deceived yourself. The ending is such that I hesitate to call it a 
"thriller," but I think in the end the hokey final moments are not enough 
to spoil what turns out to be a quite entertaining ride.
        _Primal_Fear_ is a different kind of thriller. There is very little 
idealism except that which is actually generated during the film. That 
is, instead of a hero on a white horse in the Tom Cruise/Julia 
Roberts/Susan Sarandon role, we have Richard Gere, steeped in corruption 
from the beginning, not innocent of the ways in which justice is 
administered, who somehow finds a way to redeem himself. Most of the 
action takes place between two people in small, enclosed spaces, or in 
the courtroom. Somehow, director Gregory Hoblit manages to sustain the 
audience's interest anyhow, often stunningly.
        A lot of the criticism of Richard Gere is that he always plays 
the same character. He is basically a "hair actor" like Michael 
Douglas--once you see his hairstyle, you know all the intricacies of his 
character. I disagree with this assessment of Gere. Anyone who has seen 
Mike Figgis's _Internal_Affairs_ knows that Gere is capable of real depth. 
And yet, in _First_Knight_, _Sommersby_, _Pretty_Woman_, and others, Gere 
has only given us blandly good-looking heroes without a trace of realism. 
Which is odd, because when Gere is good, he is pretty damn good. In 
_Primal_Fear_, he is pretty damn good.
        His character is Martin Vail, a defense attorney who sees a shot 
at the really big time when an altar boy is accused of killing the 
archbishop of Chicago. He offers to defend the accused killer, Aaron 
Stampler (Edward Norton), pro bono. This involves him in an actually not 
very complicated web of intrigue and deceit which gradually unwinds itself.
        The fun of the film is all in the rhythm and the interaction of 
the characters. Unfortunately, even with a high-powered cast including 
Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, Andre Braugher, John Mahoney, and Maura 
Tierney, there are really only two characters in _Primal_Fear_: Gere's Vail 
and first-time film actor Norton's Stampler. So they have to sustain a 
lot. Fortunately, both are up to the task.
        Gere plays Vail as a character who acts completely despicably, 
always scrambling for advantage. And he enjoys being as slick as he is. 
And yet, there is an underlying optimism, if not idealism, that give the 
portrayal depth. This performance is really very well modulated and 
manages to capture something about Vail that makes you believe in him.
        And as Gere said of Edward Norton, he "is emerging as one of the 
monster actors of our time." After only one film? Yep. Without giving 
away too much of the plot, the demands of the character of Aaron Stampler 
are extraordinary. Yet, even though you can see the cliched ending coming 
a mile away, you still believe absolutely in Aaron Stampler. Without 
Norton, the movie wouldn't even sustain itself as long as it does. 
Essentially, Norton found himself, as an actor, having to play a 
character who is a great actor. The sophistication and layers of his 
performance suggest that he is already miles ahead of most first-time 
actors, and promise a great career ahead of him. It is very early for 
Oscar talk, but I think it is not overstepping to say that so far, Norton 
has given one of the strongest supporting performances of the year.
        Overall, there is something about _Primal_Fear_ that is a bit too 
easy, a bit too shadily manipulative--but leaving the theater, you are not 
that upset about it. You have seen, after all, some great actors playing 
some pretty good roles with absolutely perfect pitch. And you even kind 
of get sucked in to the story, even though you know you probably shouldn't.
        As an old guy coming out of the theater where I work said after 
seeing the film, "I don't trust you; I don't trust nobody."

Review for Mission: Impossible (1996)
3 of 4 stars; nearly incoherent but fun
The pitch: "It'll be like _Sneakers_ meets _Top_Gun_!"
        The summer movies are officially upon us, may heaven be merciful. 
Don't get me wrong. I am looking forward to this season, not just because 
of the big-budget studio films like The Arnold Movie and The Big Reptile 
Movie and The Jim Carrey Movie, but also because of some independents or 
risk-takers like _Trainspotting_, from Danny Boyle, the director of 
_Shallow_Grave_, Francis Ford Coppola's _Jack_, starring Robin Williams 
("Oh, I _hate_ that disease!"), and the star-packed _A_Time_to_Kill_, which, 
I am convinced, will bring a much-deserved Oscar to Samuel L. Jackson, 
and I do not even have to see it to say that.
        That is why I was looking forward to _Mission:_Impossible_, from 
director Brian DePalma, the twisted, disturbed man who brought us _Carrie_, 
_The_Untouchables_, and _Carlito's_Way_. Unfortunately, 
_Mission:_Impossible_ is not up to his usual standard. Oh, it is 
certainly watchable, even entertaining, but there is too much missing to 
class it with even his average pictures. Is this just the burden of 
being too successful, a big name? Maybe so, but even factoring this in, 
_Mission:_Impossible_ is still not much more than a star-driven, 
big-budget B movie. _The_Bonfire_of_the_Vanities_ offers more pathos and 
emotional involvement, and MELANIE GRIFFITH is in it!
        There is probably not much reason to be so down on it. Some have 
already second-hand tried to evaluate the rumors and buzz coming out of 
production to assess blame with the many screenwriters who were brought 
in to write and rewrite the thing during shooting, or with Tom Cruise, 
the producer, for exerting too much control over DePalma, etc., etc. That 
would be a waste of breath. The only and true culprit is Hollywood, which 
does not care to take a half-second to try to make an okay movie really 
exceptional, as long as it can draw an audience. And _Mission:_Impossible_ 
is guaranteed to do that. One of my friends heard that the movie was 
opening Wednesday, but she could not make it to that showing. So I said, 
"Why not wait until Friday, so you can read my review and see if it's 
worth going to?" "Yeah, right."
        So I have no illusions about my poor power to add or detract from 
the huge box office this movie will bring in, or for that matter any 
movie critic's. It will make two hundred million dollars, and Tom Cruise 
will be able to pay the mortgage. (Whew! I know we were all worried for 
the kid.)
        And nobody will feel too ripped off, either. After all, it is not 
painful to watch the movie, and (primarily, I am convinced, because of 
the old _Mission:_Impossible_ theme by Lalo Schifrin) when the action is 
really cooking, it moves as fast and powerful as anything ever has on screen.
        The problems, then, are not overwhelming. Here they are. The plot 
is pretty much incomprehensible. If you bother to try to follow it, or 
retrace it, you will immediately find an inconsistency. Then you will 
think, "Wait. Is that really an inconsistency?" You will sit forward in 
your seat and convince yourself something deeper is going on for a 
second, then realize you were right the first time. It was just an 
inconsistency. Do not panic. It is just a movie, after all. Something 
will blow up soon and that will be fun. Especially if they play the 
music. Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doo-doo-doo! Another problem is that few 
of the very, very good actors are utilized to their fullest. Kristin 
Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez, Henry Czerny, Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, 
Ving Rhames, all have range that is never explored. And just a little 
exploration might have added some weight or substance to the story that 
would make it more than just a twisty little nothing of a film. As it is, 
though, Cruise is competent, and Vanessa Redgrave steals the movie, 
making Cruise look like a choirboy who has been singing too high for too 
long.
        When you think of Cruise films, this will never top the list. 
When you think of DePalma films, this will never top the list. When you 
think of action films, this will never top the list. When you think of 
films made from semi-popular sixties television series, this probably 
would not even make the top five. Oh well. You can't have everything, I 
guess. Still, you can't help but feel that a couple of weeks more in 
pre-production, a nice quick script rewrite by Quentin Tarantino or 
Carrie Fisher or Elaine May, or even just a bit more Lalo Schifrin, 
take-no-prisoners theme music could only have added.
        As it is, I would have to say to head in with low expectations, 
don't think too much, and make sure to pay matinee price, because it is 
worth it.
