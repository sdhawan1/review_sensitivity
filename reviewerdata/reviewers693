Review for Haunting, The (1999)
If you've seen the trailer for The Haunting, then you've basically seen
the movie. This remake of the 1963 Robert Wise classic is simply a
showcase for horrific special effects, ghostly apparitions and floating
demons that look more expensive than scary. The gorgeous production
designs and sets do a rather efficient job of covering up the countless
illogical plot holes that are found in David Self's brainless script. Or
at least, to a certain point.
It sounded just peachy keen. A haunted house movie with a talented
director and top-notch cast, in a season devoid of anything resembling
it. The audience is expecting a scary thrill ride, what they will get is
a wonderfully produced movie with a terrible execution.
Liam Neeson (in his second big summer outing, along with The Phantom
Menace) is a paranormal psychologist named Dr. Marrow, who has gathered
three patients who suffer from insomnia and invited them for a week at
Hill House - a freaky gothic mansion with a frightening decor. He
informs them that the purpose of this trip is to help them overcome
their sleep disorders. Really, he is conducting an experiment about the
dimensions of fear, and how it will affect certain individuals over
prolonged periods of time. The house itself has an erratic past (but I
won't get into the details).
The invited trio of guests are Theodora (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Eleanor
(Lili Taylor) and Luke (Owen Wilson). All three suffer from insomnia,
but for different reasons; Theo and Luke find their lives stressful and
can't settle down at night, and Eleanor has had a troubled past that's
been plaguing her for years. With these patients, Dr. Marrow wants to
ignite their imaginations and study all the effects the mansion has on
them. What the good doctor doesn't realize is that all the stories and
folklore he's heard about Hill House may just be true, and the place
could very well be haunted.
The spooky sets of The Haunting steal the movie with ease. The shoddy
set-up is aided immensely by the interior designs of the mansion, as the
characters explore them in awe. Production designer Eugenio Zanetti has
outdone himself, making the film atmospheric and creepy with an
ingenious array of statues and interior decorations. If only the script
were so effective. While the surroundings manage to cover up some of the
plot holes inconspicuously, many are left exposed. Major complaints that
I had: Dr. Marrow's two assistants, who are present for one night until
an accident occurs and they drive off to the hospital (never to be seen
again, I might add). But worse: the fact that when they are gone and
things become intense, the remaining foursome must `wait until morning'
to leave, as the caretaker and his wife have gone home.
The Haunting expects too much from the viewer. We're supposed to accept
the story even as it gets exceedingly ludicrous, and tests our patience
with plot turns that seem remarkably stupid. In the last half hour, the
film turns into a typical 90's special effects extravaganza, combining
elements from Poltergeist and The Shining to create a freak show of
shifting walls and floating ghosts that look like the Ghost of Christmas
Future. This could be fun for some people, but most will find it quite
ridiculous. Screams could in fact be muted by tiny giggles, the result
of a once-creepy mood crossing over into unintentional amusement. The
finale, though spectacular, is the least frightening aspect of The
Haunting.
Taylor is the only actor that has some sort of an emotional impact. She
struggles valiantly trying to keep her character's actions plausible,
but they derail with the rest of the movie eventually (she says `but the
children need me!' so often I felt rather ill). Neeson has never been so
dull, but he's not to blame. Zeta-Jones and Wilson don't serve much of a
purpose, besides cracking jokes and looking confused and/or scared with
the goings-on around them. Many things could have been smoother, for
instance: the first appearance of this creepy mansion could have been
memorable, but instead we get the scraggly old caretaker (played by
Bruce Dern) answering the gate and bickering sarcastically.
The Haunting is disappointing, but it has it's rewards. The marvelous
score by Jerry Goldsmith, the special effects and sets - they are all
tidbits of enjoyment in a movie that gets lost too easily in a sea of
murkiness.

Review for Very Bad Things (1998)
A more appropriate title for Very Bad Things would be Absolutely
Disgusting Things That Defy Belief. The movie is indescribably nasty; so
graphically violent that it may cause your stomach to do a somersault as
you valiantly attempt to hold your cookies. For those who can withstand
it, and (most importantly) aren't easily offended, Very Bad Things is a
refreshingly daring black comedy boasting an admirable courage as it
goes completely overboard (and then some...) into bad taste.
I would encourage those you want to truly experience this film to not
read any reviews, and just plunge straight into the grotesque, macabre
proceedings that resemble a mixture of Shallow Grave and Quentin
Tarantino. But for everyone else, here is the process in which the plot
takes off:
1) Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) and his fiancee Laura (Cameron Diaz) are
preparing for their wedding. But first, Kyle and four of his typical guy
friends - Adam (Daniel Stern), Michael (Jeremy Piven), Boyd (Christian
Slater) and Charles (Leland Orser) - are off to Vegas for a bachelor
party. Once in their hotel, the five immediately suck back an ample
amounts of alcohol and drugs.
2) A stripper arrives. After entertaining the group for a few minutes,
she heads into the bathroom with Michael for a particularly frisky round
of wall-slamming sex. Unfortunately, Michael forces her against the wall
in a hazardous place, impaling the stripper on a towel hook. After
informing the other four about the accident, Adam suggests they call the
police. Boyd steps forward  and recaps the situation, saying they would
all be risking jail time if they told the authorities. He suggests Plan
B: take the stripper out in the middle of the desert, and bury her where
no one will ever know. Or, as Boyd puts it: `We have a 105 pound problem
that we have to get from point A to point B.'
3) The group decides to bury the body in the desert, just as hotel
security knocks on the door. After entering, the guard notices the
stripper in the reflection of a mirror. He runs to check the girl's
pulse, and the others hover around the door in frightened shock. But
Boyd grabs a corkscrew from the counter and stabs the guard twice in the
chest, blocking the doorway as he bleeds to death in the bathroom. Now,
as Boyd informs them, they have two bodies to dispose of.
4) But first, a trip to the grocery store, where certain items (shovels,
plastic bags, etc.) are picked up. The group returns to the hotel, where
they clean up the blood spattered bathroom. Boyd, using an electric
turkey carver, hacks up the bodies so they can be transported by
suitcase and buried in the desert. The spare parts are sealed in plastic
wrap, and the five take off to finish the deed.
If you think this is almost unbearable after reading about it, I
wouldn't suggest you watch the movie. Actually, there is much more to
the story after the friends return home, and attempt to carry on their
lives in petrified horror. Stern, in particular, does a marvelously
convincing job of portraying a middle-aged good Samaritan who
experiences a gradual mental breakdown. The scene involving his
frustrated desperation to find `Whizzers' in a convenience store (for
his screaming kids) is extremely funny, as Adam's paranoia gets away
from him.
Some people may not find this funny at all. But I found that director
Peter Berg (an actor, best known from Chicago Hope) nicely draws the
line to prevent this from toppling over into a macabre horror movie. The
occasional scene is perfectly realized, and you laugh (sometimes in
disbelief) at the lengths Berg has taken this outlandish situation.
There are standout performances from Stern, Slater (on a highly
believable psychopath auto-pilot) and Ellen's Jeremy Piven. For the main
protagonist, Favreau is almost too bland and lifeless for the movie
surrounding him.
As I expected, the formula doesn't last for the running time.
Character's actions get out of hand, and Berg runs out of clever detours
to take. But when Very Bad Things is good, it's excellent - capturing
some of the finest black comedy ever caught on screen. Or maybe `black'
is too light a word...

Review for Playing by Heart (1998)
Starring-Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie,
Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Jon Stewart, Madeleine Stowe, Anthony
Edwards and Jay Mohr
Director-Willard Carroll
Rated PG
Miramax
Playing By Heart is ensemble romance at it's best. The story cuts
between numerous love stories; some surprising, some touching, and all
thoroughly engaging. The entire cast is in top form, as they all submit
memorable performances that each account for a significant piece of this
irresistible puzzle.
It's a real surprise to see how well director Willard Carroll juggles so
many sub-plots with entertaining ease. A large portion of the screen
time is dedicated to Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands), a
wealthy couple who have been together for 40 years, but have recently
been experiencing problems evoked by unpleasant memories. Secondly,
there is play director Meredith (Gillian Anderson), who is hesitant to
enter a relationship because of various reasons. She bumps into a
friendly architect (Jon Stewart) after she is crushed by a falling
bookcase, and the complications ensue from there. Then, there is the
story of Joan (Angelina Jolie) a young, street-wise girl who bumps into
the seemingly shy and reserved Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) at a night club.
The final romance centers around Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger
(Anthony Edwards), two lost souls looking for some escape from their
regular spouses.
But, not everything in Playing By Heart revolves around a love story. We
also follow Hugh (Dennis Quaid) through various social activities which
seem to prove he's a pathological liar. There is also the story of a man
dying from AIDS complications (Jay Mohr), and his supportive mother
(Ellen Burstyn) standing by his hospital bed. It is interesting in the
end when we find out that some of these stories are linked in some way
or another. But, we're so caught up in how every relationship develops
that we just accept everything in stride.
While every sub-plot has a few fundamental flaws, all are worthy of
sharing equal screen time. The romance that I found the most interesting
was the one shared by Jolie and Phillippe. The two are talented young
actors, and while they are handed the most challenging subject matter in
the movie, both handle it with a capable maturity. Connery and Rowlands
have the most amusing confrontations - brought on by her regrets of the
past and his tendency to blurt out a movie's entire plot and ruin any
surprises. All of the actors are marvelous. Connery (as always) manages
to captivate the viewer with every piece of dialogue, Anderson is highly
convincing even at such a stretch from her X-Files character, and Mohr
brings a tragic dilemma to believable life.
If there is one stand-out in the cast, however, it's Angelina Jolie.
Father Jon Voight appears to have passed down his acting talents,
because Jolie is a gifted and highly competent performer in every
detail. It's amazing how well the actress can make us feel for her
character, and even of other actors in the same scene. But, as I say,
everyone does a respectable job - especially with the limited screen
time they're given to prove themselves.
Playing By Heart moves swiftly, rarely stopping to examine the
relationships from a different perspective. This is a very good thing.
Any hopeless romantics are sure to be caught up in the antics from
minute one, but everyone should appreciate the all-star cast juggling
the brisk and enjoyable material. The script and dialogue are light as a
feather, but Carroll knows how to stage a scene to the most appealing
effect.
This is definitely a group effort if there ever was one. I am certainly
no sucker for romance (I have been known to object to a movie in which
nothing gets blown up), but Playing By Heart is a treat. For anyone
looking for a light, fluffy little way to spend a few hours, this
charmingly entertaining comedy will hit the spot. It certainly did for
me...and nothing even got blown up.

Title
Review for Chill Factor (1999)
Chill Factor is a carbon copy of Speed with one notable exception:
instead of a speeding bus, we now have an ice cream truck. The truck is
driven by Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Mason (Skeet Ulrich), who have
been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical
weapon to a military base by the name of Fort McGruder. This particular
weapon (nicknamed `Elvis') must be kept below a temperature of 50
degrees, or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile
radius. That would be pretty nasty.
The power of Elvis is revealed in the opening scene, as Dr. Richard Long
(David Paymer) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island. Long
accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire
island, due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance. The
commanding officer, General Brynner (Peter Firth), is sentenced to 10
years in prison for the murder of his troops.
Upon his release, the General is intent on tracking the good doctor
down, snatching Elvis, and selling the weapon to the highest
international bidder. Protecting the fate of the world is a drifting
hamburger flipper (Ulrich) and a feisty ice cream delivery man (Gooding
Jr.), who must elude Brynner's men and get Elvis to safety at Fort
McGruder. All the while, of course, they must keep the weapon below 50
degrees. This proves to be tricky. Among the wild adventures Arlo and
Mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat,
and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle. They also crack a few dozen
witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing.
To put it simply, I'll use a clever pun: Chill Factor should be put on
ice. Director Hugh Johnson has mixed elements from Speed, Broken Arrow
and the Lethal Weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a
chase movie. When there is some occasional action, the audience seems
oddly detached from it. Perhaps that's because we've already waded
through a pool of clichés and boring dialogue; all material that's been
used before, and with a lot more spice. Take the villains, for example.
They are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the
silver screen. They speak lines that have been recycled profusely from
one movie to the next, divulge important plot details while holding
their enemies at gunpoint, and act in very predictable ways.
The tag-team of Gooding Jr. and Ulrich sounds much more exciting than it
is. Frankly, I'm not sure I can accept Cuba as an ice cream man. I
suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog, selling jumbo
frankfurters on a street corner. Gooding displays one single emotion in
this movie, which is frequently on display in lines like `I'm gonna get
on yo ass like last year's underwear!' and the incessant sputtering of
`Oh, sh*t!' This is virtually the same character he played in Jerry
Maguire and As Good as it Gets. But where Gooding was once an exciting
actor, he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous. At least he's a bit
more captivating than Ulrich, who has all the film's worst dialogue, but
does nothing noticeable to enliven his character. The supporting cast,
which includes every personality you expect to pop up, is also wasted.
To be fair, there are a few brief moments of serviceable action. And I
did chuckle a few times. One example is when Ulrich (an employee at
`Darlene's Diner') is at the counter when Brynner walks through the
door. `You own this place?' the General asks.  `Yeah,' Ulrich says.
`They call me Darlene.' These little tidbits of humor are (mainly)
welcome in this weak, disappointing wreckage of an action film. As a
Speed clone, it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and
perhaps (God forbid) even some decent writing. Sadly, I walked away from
Chill Factor only wondering how much fun it could have been.

Review for House on Haunted Hill (1999)
This Halloween, you have the choice of two vastly different horror
movies. One is `Bats', a blatantly incompetent creature feature about
flying mammals that eat everyone in Texas. The second is `House on
Haunted Hill', a spooky haunted house movie about party guests trapped
inside a former medical institution. For intensive purposes, go with
`House on Haunted Hill'.
Neither film has exactly the right mixture of feverishly creepy
elements, but at least `Hill' succeeds on certain levels. After the
disappointment of the offbeat summer offering `The Haunting', audiences
may be pining for a decent haunted house movie. Despite the similar
premise shared between the two, they are relatively incompatible. `The
Haunting' carried a PG-13 rating and relied heavily on spooky production
design and expensive special effects. `House on Haunted Hill' is rated
R, putting the emphasis on elaborate gore and disturbing atmosphere and
plot devices. It too eventually evolves into an all-out special effects
barrage during the closing minutes, but everything seems more
appropriate, and not all logic is abandoned as it was in `The Haunting'.
Both films are also remakes, this of the 1958 William Castle camp
classic of the same name. That version has gone unseen by me, so
venturing into the theater for the restructured 90's rendition, I didn't
know exactly what to expect. There were some intentionally cheesy
elements, but mainly, the film is a creepy exercise in eerie atmosphere
and frightening images. With it's agreeable pace and potent shock
formula, `House on Haunted Hill' is surprisingly decent for a movie not
originally screened for critics. There is the matter of underdeveloped
characters, botched direction and missed opportunities. But whoever digs
this sort of thing will have some fun, and the film is almost perfectly
suited to the demands of the season.
Geoffrey Rush plays Steven Price, an eccentric theme park tycoon who
constructs new-age rides for the public. His wife Evelyn (Famke Janssen)
wants her upcoming birthday party set a unique environment. So, why not
have it at (say in low, rumbling voice) .... The House on Haunted Hill!!
This towering structure was once a medical institution where a psychotic
doctor (Jeffrey Combs) conducted torturous experiments. Five guests have
been invited to spend the night, with an interesting catch: whoever
survives until sunrise will receive a payment of  one million dollars
each. Of course, Steven has wired the place with elaborate booby traps
intended to scare everyone away.
The guests who show up are, strangely enough, not the original invitees.
A former pro baseball player (Taye Diggs of `Go' and `The Best Man'), a
secretive doctor (Peter Gallagher), a business executive (Ali Larter)
and a former game show host (Bridgette Wilson) are all anxious to get
their paws on the proposed money. Steven and Evelyn, who despise each
other religiously, believe that the other is playing a dirty trick. When
the locking mechanism comes down abruptly, the group is trapped inside.
Perhaps they should heed the words of the jittery Prichitt (Chris
Kattan), who rambles on amusingly about how the house is alive and
aware.
This is not a character driven film. The only actors who register are
Rush (enjoyable and over-the-top) and Kattan - although Peter Gallagher
delivers an adequate performance with his one-note caricature. The
entire cast does little but wander around aimlessly, waiting to be
served up for a slaughter. But there is the slight presence of style
over substance, and a few twists in the plot, although not especially
mind-blowing, provide enough juice to keep things pumping.
`House on Haunted Hill' has the potency to be something truly
nerve-wracking, but it settles comfortably on disturbing atmosphere.
There is a really chilling scene in which Wilson captures images of
patient dismemberment on her camera, only to notice nothing is actually
there. The graphic and unsettling prologue sets the mood nicely in the
opening sequence. It doesn't quite function altogether, but `House on
Haunted Hill' is fun. And it also gives you the major creeps.
But what about this curious ending? It's initially dumb, but is there
more to it? It may have you absorbed in conversation afterward, although
the rest of the film is quite clear: it's a campy little fright film
brimming with special effects and gooey gore.

Review for Braindead (1992)
Whatever you do, do not bother with the R-rated version of `Dead Alive'.
Stripped of twelve entire minutes of slimy gore, this version is not
worth your hard-earned cash. I mean, who would possibly rent a movie
like `Dead Alive' for anything but the gratuitous blood and extraneous
death scenes? First, ensure that the copy you picked up does not have an
MPAA rating of Restricted on the back cover. Then, with access to a
plastic barf bag, sit back and enjoy the uproarious Unrated version of
this pinnacle in horror movie-making.
Lionel (Timothy Balme) is a cowardly New Zealand man controlled by his
oppressive, domineering mother (Elizabeth Moody). One day, Lionel is
delivering a shipment of goods to a local convenience store and he meets
a beautiful clerk named Pequita (Diana Penalver). Harnessing all of his
courage and strength, Lionel asks Pequita out on a date to the zoo
(wonderful choice). Of course, in typical overbearing mother fashion,
Lionel's mum comes along for the trip to spy on the happy couple.
Unfortunately for the old hag, she stumbles too close to an adjacent
cage and is bitten by a Sumarian Rat Monkey, which has just been flown
in from overseas.
The Rat Monkey (presented in hilariously cheesy clay-mation) carries
with it a terrible plague: whoever gets bitten transforms into a
flesh-craving zombie. Lionel's mum begins experiencing certain changes -
namely, the loss of certain body parts - and nauseates baffled dinner
guests. When she eats Pequita's dog, it becomes clear that Lionel's dear
mum is not who she used to be. Soon, the entire town is infested with
zombies, even while Lionel attempts to control the plague by locking up
the undead in his fruit cellar.
`Dead Alive' (which was originally released as `Brain Dead') is perhaps
the goriest movie ever made. Director (and fellow New Zealander) Peter
Jackson has gone overboard in the field of splattered blood and
stomach-churning gore to such an extreme level that, after the final
showdown, the remaining characters are nearly knee-deep in a lagoon of
dismembered bodies. Those who carry with them a strong stomach and
appreciate the audacity of the horror genre may laugh until it hurts.
Balme is perfect in his naive, innocent role as an everyday shmoe caught
in an unlikely gorefest.
During the film's final thirty minutes, things get a little out of hand.
Lionel is forced to give up the family estate to his greedy uncle (Ian
Watkin), who invites dozens of people over for a party. Can you guess
what happens next? Here are a few helpful hints: rib cages are torn out,
people are disemboweled, legs are eaten off, and decapitated heads slide
around on the floor trying to chew on people's ankles. If that doesn't
sound like your cup of tea, then I suggest you rent `The Sound of Music'
again. This half-hour in frenetic film is sometimes so funny it causes
your sides to ache. Alas, when Balme begins using the underside of his
lawnmower to thwart the zombie intruders, Jackson gets almost too
content with himself. It gets to be a trifle too much, even for a
carnage-craving adolescent such as myself.
But, for the most part, `Dead Alive' is deviously inventive and darkly
hilarious, featuring astonishing gore effects that are often downright
sickening. The goal Jackson has in mind from the jump-start is obviously
this: to create a fun homage to classic zombie movies (such as George A.
Romero's `Night of the Living Dead'), and add buckets of blood to amuse
modern horror fans. Any individual who has followed the genre closely
and is disgusted with it's repetitive mediocrity is sure to have a
blast.
Along with the violence quota, the humor in `Dead Alive' is surely it's
most vital asset. In the single-funniest scene, a courageous priest
(Stuart Devenie) dismembers a group of zombie punks using nothing but
his hands and feet (as he puts it: `I kick ass for the Lord'). There is
also the presence of a zombie baby, which provides several fall-down
funny moments. Sure, Jackson also relies on this flesh-eating toddler so
much it gets annoying, but that's a minor problem. How in the world do
you draw a line in a film like this? If limits were set, then it could
have ruined a large portion of the fun.
I'm sure you've now realized `Dead Alive' is not for everyone, but for
all those who dare get involved, the experience will be a side-splitting
one. Just don't watch it with a full stomach. For that matter - don't
watch the R-rated version either.

Review for Scream 3 (2000)
Starring-Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette,
Patrick Dempsey, Parker Posey, Scott Foley and Jenny McCarthy
Director-Wes Craven
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Miramax Films - 02/00
All legacies have to end at some point. In the case of `Scream', the
most popular horror movie franchise of all time, I was praying the final
chapter would permit the series to wrap up on a positive note and that
dignity would be maintained. Horror sequels are hazardous waters to be
treading into, and although director Wes Craven was able to pull it off
marvelously with the cheeky follow-up `Scream 2', I was fearing that
`Scream 3' would adhere to the tiredness of formula and that the series
would expire with a sour departure. But, in this particularly rare
instance, all's well that ends well.
The first positive sign in `Scream 3' is that all the primary characters
who survived the original films have returned. The familiar faces of
bloodbaths' past certainly help to establish the cushion-padded comfort
zone that makes this entry so enjoyable. Let's begin with Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell), the innocent victim-girl who has been through
dilapidated hell ever since her boyfriend celebrated the one-year
anniversary of her mother's death by going on a knifing rampage. Sid has
left the town of Woodsboro (the original site of the killings) and
changed her name to live incognito. Meanwhile, over in Hollywood,
production on `Stab 3 - Return to Woodsboro' has just commenced. Our
beloved Dewey Riley (David Arquette) has retired from police work and
accepted a job as technical consultant on the film, while level-headed
news-hound Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) hosts a second-rate
`Entertainment Tonight' rip-off called `Total Entertainment' and paws
around the set of the latest `Stab' installment, searching for a decent
scoop without authorization. Liev Schreiber also reprises his role as
the wrongly convicted Cotton Weary, having finally found stardom on his
own television program `100% Cotton'.
Enter Ghostface, the masked murderer with a motive. The actors in `Stab
3' begin getting systematically slaughtered in the same order their
characters die in the movie. Unfortunately, to avoid leaks onto the
Internet, three different endings were devised for the film.... meaning
the next victim could depend on which version of the script the killer
read. Everyone is in possible jeopardy - from hot young screen sensation
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), who plays the film version of Gale
Weathers, to Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), who portrays a
fictionalized character named Candy and is probably intended to increase
the audience of adolescent males for `Stab 3'. Of course, everyone is a
suspect. Additional characters include the snoopy Detective Kincaid
(Patrick Dempsey), the millionaire Roger Corman-esque producer John
Milton (Lance Henriksen) and the up-and-coming music video director
Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), who takes the reins of the latest `Stab'
project.
Speaking of taking the reins, screenwriter Ehren Kruger (`Arlington
Road') has inherited the daunting task of replacing the uncanny wit of
former scribe Kevin Williamson in `Scream 3'. This is no easy chore, but
to his credit, Kruger's script contains an ample amount of crisp,
effectively staged frights and character development that remains loyal
to his predecessor. Some of the plot movements are clever and
surprisingly acute. In the department of murder sequences, Kruger
delivers a few real humdingers (one involving a fax machine, another
with a rack of Ghostface costumes and a set of rubber props). But most
of it's just the same old drill: the killer chases down an anorexic
victim, through dark corridors or steep stairwells, and plunges a knife
into their back repeatedly with swift precision. After the tense,
well-executed (but somewhat unexceptional) opening murder sequence, it
becomes gratingly obvious that `Scream 3' will settle for a simple
interpretation of Williamson's work. Fortunately, Kruger is a better
interpreter than most. And whenever the screenplay hits a rough patch,
Wes Craven's nimble direction is there to rescue it. I was frightened by
the film, and all of the creepy atmosphere and unexpected jolts are
courtesy of Mr. Craven's veteran expertise in the field of horror
movies.
`Scream 3' is more generic and conventional than the first two films,
but it has enough tricks up its sleeve to compensate. Cameos abound,
including an appearance by ill-fated `Scream'-er Randy Meeks (Jamie
Kennedy), who appears briefly on a videocassette to explain the Rules of
a Trilogy for our survivors. The scene is so subtly effective and clever
that it makes you wish Randy would return from beyond the grave for an
elongated period of quick-witted comic relief. Luckily, the living cast
members perform just fine. Campbell has never been more convincing as
the sullen `why me, Mr. Ghostface?' victim Sidney. The newlywed
Arquettes don't create the spark they captured in `Scream' and `Scream
2' (no, they have good chemistry - the script doesn't give them much
romantic interaction), but both continue to build their memorable
characters. David, in particular, is phenomenal as the lovable doofus
Dewey. It's the role of his career, and the actor capitalizes on all of
his chances to elevate the character to new heights. Indie queen Parker
Posey (who made a mainstream jump into `You've Got Mail' in 1998) is
wonderfully peppery in her spot-on impression of Gale Weathers, and
Patrick Warbuton (from `Seinfeld') has his moments as her protective lug
of a bodyguard. A few one-liners echo Williamson's self-aware touch,
including a particularly dim-witted character refusing to take a shower
because she's seen `Vertigo'.
The original `Scream' was not a landmark achievement among horror films,
but due largely to it's cleverly caustic screenplay about teens who know
the clichés of the genre, it developed into an unexpected phenomenon.
`Scream 2' was accepted on a more positive note by critics, although
audiences seemed relatively mixed. The third (and reportedly final)
chapter will not disappoint fans of the series. `Scream 3' delivers the
nail-biting goods in such a manner that teeny bopper thrill-seekers will
have trouble arguing. The overwhelming sense of closure during the
climax is a token of gratitude toward all us fans who have been
anticipating this film. Kruger finishes the cycle effectively, tying
certain events back to the original in a fashion that, while not without
plot holes, is more than satisfying. Sure, `Scream 3' occasionally
becomes the movie the first two films were lampooning, but it's executed
with style and compassion.
The audience at my screening seemed to be enjoying the film. They
laughed and they screamed, even if the formula was getting a bit stale.
Sure, the final half-hour, set inside a mansion with trapdoors and
secret passageways, is a bit frenetic. A large portion of the supporting
cast is obviously expendable. And yes, the whodunit is somewhat
underwhelming..... I was expecting a more startling surprise. It may be
the least of the trilogy, but I still had a hell of a time at `Scream
3'. I'll now rest easier knowing that the `Scream' series has been given
a proper burial.

Review for Mystery Men (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Mystery Men is a movie about super-heroes who use garden tools, cutlery
and flatulence to fight evil. They dress up in threatening, homemade
costumes and try to rid the city of crime. This sounds like it would
make a terrific Saturday Night Live skit, but a 2-hour summer movie
is... perhaps pushing it. Despite it's sporadic enjoyment and visual
flare, Mystery Men simply can't hold together as a whole.
The premise is certainly creative. In futuristic Champion City, the
local super-hero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) controls crime and rules
the streets. Sporting more product-placement ads than Tiger Woods,
Amazing is a sponsor for companies like Pepsi, Penzoil and Mighty Whitey
Toothpaste. But lately, it seems, the crime rate in Champion City has
been experiencing a serious decline. Losing the spotlight and hoping to
regain his stature, Amazing springs super-villain Casanova Frankenstein
(Geoffrey Rush) from a mental institution so he can make headlines
again. But alas, the plan backfires, as Amazing is kidnapped by Casanova
to leave the city in destruction and peril.
Enter a squad of second-rate heroes who want to also clean up the city,
and rescue Captain Amazing in the process. Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) is
a leather-clad `ticking time-bomb of fury', The Shoveler (William H.
Macy) has incredible skill with gardening tools, The Blue Raja (Hank
Azaria) tosses kitchen utensils with precise accuracy, The Spleen (Paul
Reubens) uses the deadly art of passing gas to ward off villains, The
Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) wields a bowling ball containing her late
father's skull, and Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) has the ability to
disappear when no one is looking. The fate of the city is in their
hands. I know, it doesn't look good.
While Mystery Men certainly has it's moments, the foundation is lost
with all the frantic special effects and missed opportunities. Too many
gags fall flat as a result of botched humor and imperfect comic timing.
Everything becomes caught in a whirlwind of expensive sets and visuals,
and the movie begins to see the jokes as a second priority.
Still, there are bits and pieces of sheer delight. Wes Studi plays The
Sphinx, a (supposedly) wise and mysterious super-hero who offers the
group some philosophical views on fighting crime. His pointless lessons
include `If you doubt your powers, you add power to your doubts' and
`When you care what is outside, what is inside cares for you.' Studi,
best known for his role in The Last of the Mohicans, has never been
better.
Most of the cast fares exceptionally well. Stiller is believably angry,
but he adds an unexpected sensitive side to his character that was nice
to see. Macy is wonderful (as always), but given limitations. Azaria
does a remarkable job with a cheesy British accent, Garofalo is fun to
watch, and Reubens is appropriately disgusting. Geoffrey Rush is
somewhat irritating as the long-nailed, disco lovin' super-villain, but
his performance seems perfectly on target. All of the actors, despite
some unfunny material, never display a hint of desperation.
There are amusing one-liners everywhere. Debating whether businessman
Lance Ardon and Captain Amazing are the same person, Macy argues: `Lance
wears glasses. Captain Amazing doesn't.' Hmmm... perhaps a little (wink,
wink) reference to Superman and his alter-ego. But even with clever
zingers such as this, the film can't settle on a stable conglomeration
of comedy and action, as the scale never fixates on a confident center.
Laughs are absent from certain scenes where they could have been
plentiful, and minor when they should have been huge. I certainly won't
argue if Mystery Men is funny; it is. But with more skillful material,
the proceedings could have multiplied in comedic value.
For most, this will be entertaining. But take a look at the cast list
and the enormous potential that it carried, and perhaps you'll agree: it
could have been more.

Title
Review for Affliction (1997)
Affliction is a riveting piece of entertainment on all respective
levels. The acting is extraordinary, the story is captivating and the
atmosphere is chilling and effective. While there are numerous sub-plots
about family confrontations and small-town murder, Affliction is really
only about one man who is being pushed over the edge.
That man is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), a small-town sheriff and
divorced father, who is living a complicated and frustrating life in the
snow covered surroundings of New Hampshire. The first half of the story
rotates largely around Wade's best friend Jack Hewitt (Jim True), who
accompanies a business man on a hunting expedition only to witness him
shoot himself. While Jack stresses it was just a freak hunting accident,
Wade thinks there is something more to it. And so he uncovers a possible
conspiracy involving his boss (Holmes Osborne), and the victim's
son-in-law.
But Affliction is, by no means, a murder mystery. The real emotional
charge comes care of Wade's relationship with his drunken, abusive
father (marvelously played by James Coburn). Director Paul Schrader
(veteran scribe of such films as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver) uses
flashbacks to introduce us to the Whitehouse family problems, and this
approach is incredibly effective, especially on the basis of visual
presentation. Schrader presents the footage in a fuzzy, worn appearance,
much like an old home video filmed with the picture out of focus. Some
people may find this tedious, but the effect is profoundly striking.
Affliction turns into Wade's incomparable struggle to come to grips with
everything in his life. He's fighting a custody battle with his ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) for his daughter he cares for but can't rightfully
support, the appearance of his father puts an awkwardness on his current
relationship with local waitress Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), and on top
of it all he has an incredible toothache. Wade Whitehouse is a troubled
human being living a turbulent life, and some may find it difficult to
watch as it spirals out of control.
The standout reason to see Affliction is the incredible performances.
While Coburn's performance is phenomenal and downright chilling, it's
Nolte who owns the screen. This is the breakout performances of the
actor's career, and he leaves no margin for error in his portrayal of
the troubled sheriff. His performance is commanding and immensely
powerful. I also found much to like in the performance of Willem Dafoe
as Wade's younger, more civilized brother. Dafoe's presentation is
initially limp, but we come to relate to his quiet and dignified
character. Schrader uses Dafoe as a voice-over narrative in sporadic
instances, but doesn't go overboard. The director knows his actors are
competent enough to set the point across themselves, and rarely relies
on this familiar narration approach.
Nick Nolte has taken to his role as Wade Whitehouse like a bull by the
horns, and the riveting outcome of the movie is directly because of his
amazing performance. While James Coburn won an Oscar for his role (and
rightfully so), Affliction should always be remembered as Nolte's movie.
For the first time in years, the actor's fierce aggression on screen
does not seem forced, not even marginally. His character is so
overwrought with paranoia, family issues and business problems and
Nolte's delivery seems completely and utterly perfect. While the ending
of Affliction is rather simplistic, it creates a shocking final effect
that hits right at home in the heart of the viewers, like a single brick
landing with a resounding thud' at your feet. The snowy November
weather only assists as Affliction, a startling character drama with a
superb cast, succeeds in stopping your blood cold.

Title
Review for Insider, The (1999)
`The Insider', a riveting dramatization of the events that occurred in
the tobacco wars of 1995, is a movie of rare superiority. While some
movies merely present the facts, `The Insider' involves the viewer with
them, to such a point that it feels as if we're watching a real-life
simulation rather than a movie. It's about as absorbing as a film of
this genre can be.
Capturing your attention from minute one, director Michael Mann proceeds
to masterfully
craft the story of a former tobacco company employee named Jeffrey
Wigand (Russell
Crowe), who reveals to the CBS program `60 Minutes' how cigarettes are
being illegally enhanced by chemicals to make them more addictive.  `60
Minutes' producer Lowell
Bergman (Al Pacino) first approaches Wigand for his knowledge in another
matter, but
after the continued threatening of his family and health plan, Wigand
makes the crucial
decision to expose the secrets that his boss originally withheld while
testifying before
congress. It's an engrossing story that captivates your interest, both
in the aspects of journalism and it's compelling human details.
Crowe is superb as Wigand, who is shown as a thoughtful family man
committed to his job. All of the key scenes involving Wigand's shocking
revelation - namely, a courtroom
sequence and the `60 Minutes' interview itself - are pure dynamite.
Crowe digs deep
within the character to give the audience an accurate personification of
his complicated situation. He and Pacino compliment each other in such a
miraculous fashion, as if to
suggest the two actors have worked together on several projects previous
to this one. Both
Crowe and Pacino deserve to be recognized by the Academy come nomination
time.
The interview with the tobacco industry insider never ran, because of
the possible lawsuit
that could have resulted. CBS pulled the plug in fear of a tobacco
company takeover, and Wigand was infuriated because he had risked his
life and social stature and felt manipulated
by Bergman and the `60 Minutes' crew. Afterward, the story ran in the
New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and Bergman resigned from CBS
due to the future complications that would arise with new stories.
If `The Insider' has one deficiency, it's the matter of it's elongated
running length, which clocks in around the vicinity of 2 hours and 40
minutes. The dramatic thrust of the story almost becomes too
overwhelming and convoluted. After the two hour mark, the amount of
interest declined on my part. Undeniably though, for a movie to attain
that amount of fascination and involvement for such a time span is quite
remarkable. Backed by stellar performances, Mann (who previously teamed
with Pacino for the action film `Heat') directs at the top of his form.
In the supporting category, virtually everyone contributes. Diane Venora
is excellent as Wigand's estranged wife. As `60 Minutes' news
correspondent Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer reinvents the word
`intensity' with exceptional ferocity, and Philip Baker Hall delivers as
executive producer Don Hewitt. There are several moments that jump right
off the screen, namely an electrifying courtroom sequence in which a
heated attorney (Bruce McGill, terrific in a tiny role) defends Wigand
by verbally attacking an opposing representative. If you exert a fair
amount of patience and understanding, you'll be glued to your seat
during `The Insider'.
At first, the premise of `The Insider' didn't strike as one that could
be this enthralling. Nonetheless, I was hardly bored with the film, even
during it's periodic lulls of detailed investigation. It's just so
invigorating to have a true story told with such bracing skill as `The
Insider', and it's also quite refreshing, because few thrillers of
modern day cinema are this self-involved.
It's a full-fledged dramatic powerhouse that deserves to be mentioned at
the upcoming Academy Awards ceremony. I'm sure the real Lowell Bergman
and Jeffrey Wigand would approve.

Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
Last summer, a feature-length version of The Avengers hit theaters to
the tune of a
unanimous critical panning. Based on the famous 60's television show,
the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for
Warner Bros. A year later, the studio is up to their old tricks again,
with the unnecessary revival of the Robert Conrad program The Wild, Wild
West. But it sounded promising: the same tag-team of star Will Smith and
director Barry Sonnenfeld, who both contributed to make Men in Black
such a financial success, is at the reins again. And co-star Kevin Kline
is attached to the project, as well as a substantial budget to spice up
the special effects. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?
The answer is just about everything. Wild Wild West is a cinematic
abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that
it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate. There are a
lot of fancy special effects, and a handful of distinguished actors who
try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting
impression. But the script is so deliriously uneven, the entire movie so
off course, that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to
salvage it.
At square one, we have a bizarre case of casting. Will Smith plays James
West, a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor Robert
Conrad in the TV series. My guess regarding the casting of
African-American Smith is a simple one: the actor + a cozy summertime
release = big bucks for all those involved. Smith is a very talented
performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief
material, but this is not an ideal role for him. He's too much of a
joker. I heard that initial casting included George Clooney in the lead
role, and frankly, that sounds a lot more plausible. What makes matters
worse is that Smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in
his eyes; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that
he knows Wild Wild West will be a huge hit at the summer box office.
The plot involves West and cross-dressing government agent Artemus
Gordon (Kevin Kline), who are assigned by the President to recover a
group of kidnapped scientists. The trail leads to the diabolical Dr.
Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a man with no lower body who speaks
in a dry, witty southern accent. Loveless has taken the country's top
technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of
total government control, using lethal superweapons to destroy entire
towns. One such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula, bearing eight
spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and
right. The visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are
spectacular, seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the
western surroundings. Unfortunately, all of these effects seem so
detached from the story, and can do little to support the film's plot
deficiencies, which are undoubtedly the main problem.
Wild Wild West is a running gag that never truly works. Most of the
jokes, usually care of Smith, die on arrival. If it's one thing that
could possibly be the saving grace, it's the performances, and even they
are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered. Kline is admirable, but he
has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot. Salma Hayek is
wasted as the romantic interest, because she is viewed as little more
than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between
West and Gordon. Branagh, an esteemed Shakespearean actor and director,
adds marginal enjoyment to the film. But even he is so utterly weird and
over-the-top. Rarely is a film so lost in itself as Wild Wild West is.
I suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season; a highly
anticipated, big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint.
Wild Wild West is such a movie, and will probably go down as one of the
biggest disappointments of 1999. But it is highly unlikely that this
will go down in defeat at the box office. Perhaps after this, audiences
will be less assured when they see Will Smith's name stamped on a summer
movie. After such hits as Independence Day and MiB, Wild Wild West is
not an impressive addition to the resume.

Review for American Pie (1999)
All those who were offended by There's Something About Mary should not
tread in the waters of American Pie, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster
ride of raunch. And while this uproariously funny, gross-out summer
movie is basically an exercise in bad taste, it also demonstrates a
surprising sweetness in the end.
American Pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare
this season. I must question the studio that releases a movie like this.
The producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd, but while
pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an R-rated film. Some
have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded NC-17, a rating the MPAA
gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a Restricted movie.
American Pie was threatened with an NC-17, but after snipping a few
scenes from the finished product, it was given an R. But at least this
new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like South
Park. It is sick, perverse, and ultimately disgusting - not to mention
extremely funny.
American Pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose
their virginity by prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are a quartet
of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something
they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead. Jim inquires
what it feels like when you reach third base, to which one of his
friends replies: `Like warm apple pie...'. Of course, this prompts the
scene unfairly exposed in the trailers, in which Jim and a freshly baked
pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner. There are many
moments, such as this, in which director Paul Weitz uses a game-plan
similar to the one frequently displayed in Mary: to cause the audience
to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief. American Pie is a
hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick
with it.
I loved the young cast in this movie. Consider the subject matter that
these actors have dealt with, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in
any of their previous projects, and you should appreciate their
performances. Biggs is more than enjoyable, and Chris Klein (who
recently played a similar jock in Election) is obviously a young talent
on the rise. But in a teen-dominated movie, the best performance comes
from comedian Eugene Levy (of television's SCTV), who is unexpectedly
brilliant as Jim's uneasy father. Scenes in which the familiar
father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the
funniest moments to be found in American Pie. After Levy discovers Jim's
new use for apple pie, he tells him, `I did a fare share of that sort of
thing when I was your age. But I never used baked goods.' It is
performances such as his, and Bill Murray's in Rushmore, that are often
unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out.
There are some less-than-original aspects of the film. A bathroom
incident involving Finch and a bottle of Ex-Lax is something we've seen
before. If Weitz is planning to take after the Farrelly brothers, then
this is a decidedly unwise move: the same prank was pulled in the
brother's Dumb and Dumber, and used to greater effect. Secondly, the
characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more
artificial than amusing. But at one point, in which we discover that
American Pie does have a heart of it's own, Biggs asks his buddies why
he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very
important anyway.' And so we realize that while the film is expressive
about a subject that is hardly appropriate, it still manages to be
mature. In it's own way.

Title
Review for Hudson Hawk (1991)
I suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like Hudson Hawk, which has
been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release.
Michael Lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box
office flop of all time', or close thereof.
The movie stars Bruce Willis as renowned cat burglar Hudson Hawk, who's
just been released from Sing Sing prison after many years in isolation
(`Let me put it this way,' he explains, `I never saw ET'). Greeting him
is his old friend and partner in crime (played by Danny Aiello), who
becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes. These are rather welcome
in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags, cartoonish
villains and unbelievable coincidences. It appears as if director
Lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness, and he piles
on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself
toward the finish line. If at some point during Hudson Hawk you make the
assumption that things couldn't get goofier, you'll soon be eating your
words.
But, I'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's
box office numbers suggest. It's fast-paced and entertaining, if you've
got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor. For the first
portion of this review, I'm going to try and center on the positive
aspects of Hudson Hawk. Wish me luck.
First and foremost: Bruce Willis is a good sport. While I'm not entirely
sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script, Willis is quite
aware that the entire project is a big, fat, ugly joke. He constantly
gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place,
which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions.
Another plus is the appearance of Andie MacDowell as a schizophrenic nun
and love interest for the title character. They meet when Hudson goes on
a mission to steal a priceless book from the Vatican, and their
relationship escalates in interest from there. It's unfortunate that
McDowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be
a predictable plot-twist, and she offers absolutely no encouraging
chemistry with Willis. But now I'm rambling on again about the negative
things, aren't I?
Enough of the charade - for the most part, Hudson Hawk is an
excruciating experience. It's stupid, pointless and repetitive. I can
only wonder what Bruce Willis fans thought after exiting the theater,
because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone.
Action fans should take note that Hudson Hawk is composed of 90% comedy,
and even the action sequences are skittery, rushed and poorly edited.
And those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to
smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks. Don't get me wrong,
this film is not devoid of laughs. It's too bad most of them are
unintentional, or just plain forced.
The impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed. It's understandable to
see Willis and Aiello in a movie of this caliber, but as for the
presence of future Academy Award winner James Coburn I'm not entirely
sure. Coburn plays a former nemesis of the Hawk who again comes into
play, and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie. Especially when
he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown, and has a fight
with Willis that would look right at home in a Jackie Chan film. Things
get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named
after chocolate bars, including future NYPD Blue star David Caruso as
the speechless, card-flipping Kit-Kat. If that's not enough for you,
there's Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard hamming it up as a deranged
couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover. Their
crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here. Wait,
maybe the only big laughs...
I'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming Hudson
Hawk. I can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot; but
let's not get into that. I suppose there's some amusement viewers could
derive from the ridiculous premise, if they were that desperate. But
Hudson Hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one,
and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck.

Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
Starring-Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart,
Marg Helgenberger, Cherry Jones and Peter Coyote
Director-Steven Soderbergh
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Universal Pictures - 03/00
`Erin Brockovich' is the first movie of 2000 that made me want to stand
up and exclaim `You go, girlfriend!' during showtime.
Hoping to keep my personal dignity intact, I waived that opportunity to
thoroughly embarrass myself, although I sensed the other theater patrons
would have supported my bombastic outburst. After all, the title
character of Steven Soderbergh's `Erin Brockovich' is such a smart,
sassy heroine. Although her manner is laced with brash, foul-mouthed
terminology and her wardrobe is indicative of a street-corner
prostitute, Erin generates an instantly likable presence of good looks
and quick wits. The twice-divorced mother of three shows admirable
persistence as she claws at accomplished lawyer Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), demanding a position at his law firm by attacking him like an
unleashed pitbull as opposed to kissing up. While in certain
circumstances it proves to be more of a distraction than a
reinforcement, a big name star like Julia Roberts seems to only further
the bolstering appeal of the snappy `Erin Brockovich'.
Roberts is certainly positioned at center-stage, delivering a powerhouse
performance that could be the definitive achievement of her career, but
she is backed by a beneficial slew of wonderful supporting performances.
An early prediction for the 2001 Oscar telecast: Albert Finney for Best
Supporting Actor. Erin first meets Masry after she is involved in an
auto collision and he is assigned to represent her. Unfortunately, even
though it was the fault of the other driver, Masry loses the case
because of Erin's feisty attitude and flagrant use of profanity.
Afterward (and I'm sidestepping some big complications), when Erin
begins working at the firm as a legal assistant, the interaction between
Roberts and Finney becomes some of the most fun and tractable I've ever
witnessed between two polar opposite characters. Finney (most recently
in `Simpatico') is such a joy to watch; as Masry slowly progresses to
the point of accepting and understanding Erin, we believe every ounce of
it. More enthusiasm should be directed to Aaron Eckhart as friendly
biker boyfriend George, who acts as nanny to Erin's three kids while she
discovers the demanding conditions of a business environment. The main
concentration of Susannah Grant's funny, observant screenplay is Erin
herself (a wise move given the compelling nature of the character), and
yet the film achieves measurable success on a collective level as well.
Did I mention this is all based on a true story? The accolades of the
real Erin Brockovich are unbeknownst to me (like many), but whether it
is entirely factual or not, Soderbergh's film visibly flounders only
during the opening minutes. The plot, involving Erin's investigation of
a possible hexavalent chromium contamination in the local water supply,
is strictly recycled Hollywood formula -- often bearing resemblance to
the 1998 legal thriller `A Civil Action' -- but the dramatics are
enhanced by the compelling human details, and a briskly enjoyable
character study only further motivated by top-flight performances.
Soderbergh's latest work includes the revenge thriller `The Limey' and
the comic crime caper `Out of Sight', but the director will be forever
known for the independent landmark `sex, lies and videotape'. Just as
Soderbergh revolutionized the Sundance Film Festival with `videotape' in
1989, he has breathed new life into the formulaic courtroom drama with
`Erin Brockovich'.
More likable magnetism comes from the fact that `Erin', at its core, is
a feel-good movie. The grin on your face will spread ear-to-ear as you
exit the theater, because the story of a little nobody striving to make
a big difference is always a crowd-pleasing antidote. It's all the more
acceptable in `Erin Brockovich', where the familiarities seem fresh and
involving because the characters entangled within the regular genre
clichés are not just boring, career-driven caricatures. It's nice to be
able to identify with Erin's plight, as she becomes torn between work
and family, than simply understand the verdict she is battling for in
court. Soderbergh puts little strain on the viewer in his journey to
help us encompass this fact. Let's hope `Erin Brockovich' isn't too
early an addition for possible Oscar attraction next year. If the
Academy members have forgotten the stellar performances and direction
that this film has to offer by then, I will weep for the filmmaking
community. Just as the title character conducts herself, `Erin
Brockovich' goes for the throat and wins you over.

Review for Patch Adams (1998)
To think that the two people behind the Ace Ventura movies would combine
to make a movie like this. It is true, Tom Shadyac (director of Ace
Ventura) is behind the camera, and Steve Oederkerk (director of Ace
Ventura: When Nature Calls) has written the screenplay in one of the
year's most touching films.
Robin Williams brings all his hilarious baggage and his dramatic side
with him playing the title character, Patch Adams, a med student who
believes that laughter is the best medicine to help his patients.
Discovering his talent to help people while admitted to a mental
institution, Patch sets his goal of becoming a doctor. Toting a fake
white overcoat to disguise himself (actually, it's a meat packing
jacket), Patch weaves in and out of hospital rooms making people laugh.
If at least a smile doesn't form across your face while watching
Williams make hospitalized children laugh, then you must be closely
related to the Grinch.
I'm not at all surprised to say this is an excellent movie. At the
same time, it is a long distance from being a perfect movie. But you
have to applaud a film when it has the ability to make you laugh and
cry so much in a limited 2-hour period. Despite the obviously serious
premise of Williams helping those in need, there is still plenty to
laugh about here.  One scene, in particular, will have to go on the
record shelves for one of the funniest moments in movie history. And
yet, the filmmakers never stray too far and fail to make the point
that they're attempting.
Robin Williams is again wonderful - heck give the man another Academy
Award. He's the heart and soul of Patch Adams, balancing the movie on
his shoulders like a scale about to tip at any moment. Amazingly, he
never lets it drop, or even budge, for that matter. He gets and
excellent supporting turn from Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing another
doctor who at times questions Patch's methods of viewing death, as
something humorous. Monica Potter is also memorable as his
self-conscious love interest, who's studying medicine herself.
There's lots of emotions to feel in this movie. Whether they are good or
bad, the entire project is so heartwarming you may have the urge to hug
the people sitting next to you. Patch Adams is a movie each and every
human being should see.

Title
Review for Stigmata (1999)
While technically well-made, Stigmata never possesses a very logical
story or enough originality to warrant a recommendation. It's a
spiritual thriller that most audiences will either find offensive or
preposterous, depending on their religious view-point. The plot asks for
too much of the viewer's co-operation, and the film itself is an
all-together numbing experience for all who get involved.
The Stigmata are the wounds of Christ on the wrists, feet and back.
Certain religious individuals have been afflicted by these bizarre
lacerations over the years. The latest victim appears to be single
hair-dresser Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), who has began suffering
strange demonic attacks. On more than one occasion, Frankie is admitted
to a hospital with bleeding wounds that appear to be self-inflicted.
It's only after a public attack on a subway train that the Vatican
begins to take notice. They send a Roman Catholic Priest named Andrew
Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate the phenomenon, and see for
himself whether the Stigmata are involved. One argument to prove
otherwise is that Frankie does not attend church, and the victims are
always `deeply religious people'.
Video director Rupert Wainwright is behind the camera for Stigmata, and
his sense of style oozes through every frame. The entire movie is shot
in a bizarre tone of bleached colors. It looks as if Wainwright was
glazed over the film, accentuating certain colors with a neon tint and
blocking out others. He also uses stylish camera work, but
unfortunately, this approach grows tiresome after a while. It seems as
if when one aspect of the production is working, the other is flagging
hopelessly behind. The set-up of the story is awful, but the movie looks
great. Then, as the plot shifts into high gear, the film develops into a
reasonably competent thriller. Of course, by this time, the quick-flash
editing and camera trickery are getting old (not to mention tough on the
eyes). If you're a very patient person and you love Patricia Arquette,
then Stigmata is definitely for you.
For others, I would advise to stay clear. Some people are not going to
be very pleased with the religious undertones presented here. As the
story develops, the Cardinal (Jonathan Pryce) becomes worried that the
new reports could destroy the Vatican. But, despite some obvious
potential, there are few twists and turns involved in the initial story.
There's nothing particularly fresh or new. Just a plot that delivers an
occasional jolt to maintain the viewer's interest, including graphic
attack sequences that will make your head spin in a dizzying rage. Some
of these bloody scenes could have been toned down, in violence and
momentum.
The cast is quite good. Arquette is perfect in her role as the tormented
twenty-something victim, but it's the Vatican members who make the
biggest impression. The talented Byrne plays Kiernan as a wise and
authoritative individual, even when his actions seem relatively
implausible. In minor supporting roles, Pryce and Rade Sherbedgia are
both commanding. Without the willing participation of these actors,
Stigmata would have been a big, bloated mess.
It's not very pretty as it is, but the movie has some strengths. The
director does a fair job of involving the audience in the mindless muck,
and some of the information is moderately interesting. But all of this
is only to a point. Once Stigmata abandons it's over-the-top approach
and begins leaning toward a more conventional thriller, things
(ironically) improve. Wainwright, though, demands too much attention for
a feature-length film, and should stick to the MTV profession.
Who exactly is this movie for? People wanting a revised story of The
Exorcist? Even those loyal followers may be frustrated by this mixed bag
of spiritual shenanigans.  Sorry folks, no flying green phlegm here.

Title
Review for Muse, The (1999)
The Muse is 3/4 of a great film. For the majority of Albert Brooks'
newest satire, the comedy is vibrant and funny, the situation is
amusing, and the stars are immensely likable. And then, without warning,
the film abruptly switches gears into sheer stupidity.
I suppose the 80 minutes of running time before it tumbles over into
idiocy is worth giving The Muse a (very) minor recommendation. But I
just can't help wondering what the film could have been if the formula
hadn't derailed in the last dying minutes. To be sure, there are some
big laughs and clever moments to be found. Unfortunately, the few
crucial twists toward the end leave a sour taste in your mouth.
Brooks, directing himself once again, plays screenwriter Steven
Phillips. As the movie opens, Steven is receiving a Humanitarian award
for his contribution of over 17 Hollywood scripts (one of which was
nominated for an Oscar). He ends his speech by stating `I'm the King of
the room!', a punch line that no one finds amusing. Steven's co-workers
and friends agree, even though the talent is still there, that he has
`lost his edge'. This is when good friend and fellow writer Jack (Jeff
Bridges) tells him the secret of his success: a muse. As the story goes,
they are daughters of Zeus, and are able to inspire creativity. Steven,
of course, doesn't believe it at first. So he coaxes Jack into setting
up a meeting with his so-called `muse', and he can judge for himself
whether she is for real.
Sarah (Sharon Stone) is this goddess of creativity. She has worked with
such directors as James Cameron, Rob Reiner and Martin Scorcese, and can
claim responsibility for The American President and The Truman Show. She
requests a room at the Four Seasons hotel, where she is open to
unlimited room service, and for a limousine to transport her everywhere
she goes. Steven doesn't know quite what to think of this, but figures
all this incessant spending is worth it if he is able to regain `his
edge'. He laughably attempts to describe the situation to his wife Laura
(Andie MacDowell), especially when Sarah calls at midnight requesting a
salad and bobby pins to be delivered to her hotel room.
Part of the fun in The Muse is seeing what lengths Steven will go to,
even if Sarah only claims to be what she is. Is she actually able to
inspire her clients, or is she just masterminding an incredible hoax?
There is proof of the first query, presented in a nice subplot about
Sarah helping Laura to realize her dream of becoming the next `Mrs.
Fields' (translation: a masterful cookie queen). And Steven does start
to write a screenplay involving Jim Carrey and an aquarium, but he
insists that was his idea. Sarah continues to milk him for every penny,
Laura begins to enjoy her company and inspiration, and so basically
Steven is in hell.
Fans of Brooks' low-key humor will likely enjoy his latest effort. There
are a couple of great gags - one involving Steven's conversation with a
man who can hardly understand the English language - and some nicely
placed Hollywood humor. And in the center of it all, there is Sharon
Stone's wonderful performance as the snotty title character. Lord knows
what Brooks was thinking when he capped off this otherwise engaging
comedy with an ending straight out of the Twilight Zone.
Up until everything goes awry, I really enjoyed myself. To be fair, I
did a large amount of smiling, perhaps... even chuckling. So I was
personally pretty bummed out after watching all of these amusing events
transpire, only to see them discarded in favor of a hopefully `clever'
twist. If I were writing Brooks himself, it would go something like
this: `Albert: I quite enjoyed your latest offering. But, WHY??'

Title
Review for 20 Dates (1998)
David E. Kelley, it seems, has yet to find a comfortable niche in the
Hollywood film industry. Kelley (the creator of Ally McBeal and The
Practice) tried his luck earlier this year with Lake Placid, a crocodile
comedy that apparently didn't contain enough wit (or was that too much
wit?). Now, the writer has concocted an imaginary Alaskan town to bring
us the hockey-oriented Mystery, Alaska.
Citizens of Mystery celebrate the Canadian pastime of ice hockey like a
religion. The town sheriff, Jon Biebe (Russell Crowe), leads the local
11-man squad out every Saturday for a league game on a nearby pond.
Everyone is excited when the latest Sports Illustrated issue appears,
containing a three-page article about the dedication to the sport in the
small town. The writer of the article, former Mystery resident Charles
Danner (Hank Azaria), comes calling soon after with an interesting
proposition. It seems NHL executives read the story and thought it would
be great publicity to send the New York Rangers up to Alaska for an
exhibition game. Everyone is Mystery is soon overcome with anxiety, as
they try and prep the town for the Rangers' arrival in a mere 32 days.
Kelley always populates his projects with humorous personalities, and
here he sticks with tradition. The mayor (Colm Meaney) doesn't want to
be embarrassed by this `publicity stunt'. He should be more concerned
about his wife (Lolita Davidovich), who is having a heated affair with a
careless player named, appropriately, Skank (Ron Eldard). Skank seems to
be setting his sights on a different female target every night (as he
puts it, `I play hockey and fornicate. Those are the two funnest things
to do in cold weather'). Meanwhile, Biebe's wife Donna (Mary McCormick)
seems to be eyeing recent returnee and old high school flame Danner.
Burt Reynolds plays Judge Burns, a former hockey coach and big fat
grouch extrordinaire.
This is certainly not one of Kelley's better outings. His screenplay
(which he co-wrote with Sean O'Byrne) stumbles terribly out of the gate,
jumbled with plot details and unsure of what direction to eventually
take. Luckily, he begins an admirable recovery during the days leading
up to the big game, with some surprisingly effective dramatics that
almost caught me off guard. More recognition should go to director Jay
Roach (of Austin Powers' fame), who paints an enjoyable portrait of a
small town about to be placed in the spotlight.
Mystery, Alaska is entirely predictable from the first frame on - and
yet, even as the inevitable rolls around, it remains in good fun. The
film is a bit too profane than perhaps needed, but that's only when it
sidesteps it's generally pleasant and good-natured appeal. The plot is
basically an underdog story like The Mighty Ducks, only for adults. And
despite one or two obvious caricatures, these Alaskans have a certain
charm.
The caricatures are Azaria and Reynold's characters (with the latter
saving his obvious existence with convincing gruffness), but the rest of
the cast is rock solid. Crowe, who displayed wonderful intensity in L.A.
Confidential, gives Jon Biebe the everyman quality that any lead
requires. Colm Meaney and Maury Chaykin are both terrific in supporting
roles, and one Mystery team player caught my eye: the big, likable oaf
Tree (a perfectly cast Kevin Durand). With his effortless charm and
persistence, Durand owns a few of the best scenes in the movie.
Regular sports movies' clichés abound in the last thirty minutes, but a
few unexpected cameo appearances help quite a bit. As I mentioned
before, every second of film can probably be predicted beforehand. Will
the former coach step forward and guide the underdog team to a win? Will
the star player escape a prison charge in time to play the game? Well,
duh. Mystery, Alaska is funny and entertaining enough to adequately fill
a two-hour time slot - unless, of course, you absolutely despise
everything involving David E. Kelley and the game of hockey. But then,
why would you even go?

Review for Astronaut's Wife, The (1999)
As of late, certain summer movie releases have been utilizing a common
trend. In The Sixth Sense, an unforeseen final twist in the story-line
has surprised many moviegoers who were not expecting anything of the
sort. And earlier in the season, the terrorist thriller Arlington Road
concluded with a devious turn of events that had me staggering out of
the theater. The Astronaut's Wife is the latest summer entry to attempt
this strategic maneuver, and the first to fall flat in the process.
If writer/director Rand Ravich does one thing effectively, it's building
the audience's anticipation for his uneventful script to switch into
high gear. As this predictable and untimely surprise finale hits, a
painful realization sets in. Ravich has been moderately successful with
intriguing us until this point, only to reveal he has nowhere to go.
This leaves numerous questions unanswered, many opportunities unfairly
squandered, and ultimately an unsatisfied audience exiting the theater
while swearing and cursing in disgust. The set-up is interesting enough,
but sadly there is no recognizable payoff in this disappointing effort.
The story follows NASA employee Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp), who is
sent into orbit with fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) on a
routine space shuttle mission. The assignment seems to be going
according to plan until a freak explosion occurs, severing all
communications to Earth for roughly a two minute period. Worried wives
Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) and Natalie Streck (Donna Murphy) are
relieved when their husbands arrive back safely. But both are surprised
to find bizarre personality changes occurring in the men. When Jillian
becomes pregnant, she begins to question if Spencer is the same person
he was before the mission. What happened in those two minutes? Use your
imagination....
The beautiful Charlize Theron is, consequently, displaying a short
blonde look that suspiciously resembles Mia Farrow's in the 1968
thriller Rosemary's Baby. This is only one of the movies that The
Astronaut's Wife derives its premise from. There is also a pinch of
Species II (of all things) and a dash of The Fly thrown in to boot. The
best elements of these films combined could produce an excellent,
hair-raising suspense film. Unfortunately, The Astronaut's Wife is
hardly a top-notch effort. Theron's character spends basically the
entire duration of the film learning facts we already know, thanks to a
very informative trailer that spoils most of the thrills. Despite
enormous potential in the initial story, there is hardly a twist
involved - excepting (of course) the final `surprise'. One would hope
that Ravich had something stylish or striking up his sleeve, but it is
ultimately disappointing when we realize he has settled on the obvious.
His script and direction leave much to be desired.
In the title role, Theron does an admirable job. Her emotional and
mental breakdowns in certain scenes are highly convincing, even as she
goes through the familiar steps. Johnny Depp, speaking with an unusual
drawl that made me cringe, has considerably less success. His delivery
is highly flawed, and Depp seems surprisingly miscast in the role. The
excellent Joe Morton (Speed, Blues Brothers 2000) provides some thankful
assistance as Sherman Reese, a NASA official who fears that something
went terribly wrong in space. And Clea DuVall (The Faculty) has some
promising moments as Jillian's younger sister.
The Astronaut's Wife was not screened for critics before release, and
I'm not exactly sure why. There's certainly early promise, some solid
acting, and a steady pace that maintained my complete attention. While
Ravich doesn't do anything terribly wrong to upset the balance, he never
succeeds in doing much right either. And who can blame the average
viewer for feeling cheated, after staying with this promising formula
for nearly two hours, only to have it botched by a pathetic ending like
this. We deserve more than The Astronaut's Wife delivers.

Title
Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
`The Talented Mr. Ripley' is an offbeat addition to the Holiday movie
schedule - perhaps the most unlikely contender of the Christmas season.
In his follow-up to `The English Patient', director Anthony Minghella
appears to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock, as everything is executed
with a certain style and sophistication that seems reminiscent of the
late director's best work. If he were still alive today, it wouldn't
surprise me if Mr. Hitchcock would blush at the sight of Minghella's
latest offering; `The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a finely oiled suspense
machine crammed with a thorough sense of fascination.
The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, which was previously
adapted to the silver screen in 1960 under the name of `Purple Moon', a
film which won critical acclaim for it's intricate and unsettling study
of an unstable but highly intelligent sociopath named Tom Ripley. In
Minghella's version, Matt Damon inherits the icy title role with plenty
of chilling results. Although I haven't read Highsmith's novel, many
sources are indicating that the new version of Tom Ripley is portrayed
with far more innocence than the previous one....shaping the modern
Ripley into an unwilling murderer who only kills as a last resort. This
approach opens a wide canvas for mystery and intrigue, and Damon's
frightening metamorphosis into the main character is a masterful balance
of sinister charm and brilliant intuition.
Ripley, a curious dreamer and master chameleon, is persuaded by the
wealthy Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to travel to Italy and
retrieve his son Dickie (Jude Law) so he can return home and see the
family. Once he arrives at his destination, Tom is swept away by
Dickie's lifestyle: his dashing fiancee Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), his
friends, his social stature... It is safe to say Tom is more than
slightly intrigued by the notion of living Dickie's life for him. And
that brings us to this little snippet of dialogue, spoken by Tom in a
moment of quiet revelation: `I always thought it would be better to be a
fake somebody than a real nobody.'
`The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a rich and unsettling tapestry of murder
and suspense that is neither predictable nor formulaic - a rarity for
the thriller genre, which makes for a delectable Christmas treat.
Minghella's film is, in terms of artistic beauty and emotional craft,
one the finest films of the year. Taking a page from Hitchcock classics
like `Psycho' and `North by Northwest', it offers a fascinating and
jarring character study that extends generously to each of the three
leads - with Damon carrying the most demanding load and delivering
superbly. Jude Law (`eXistenZ' and `Gattaca') also delivers an
Award-caliber performance as the spoiled playboy Dickie Greenleaf, and
Paltrow, while not emitting the vigorous radiance of her performance in
`Shakespeare in Love', proves to a competent piece of the twisted
puzzle. In support, both Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Dickie's smug and
contemptuous playboy buddy) and Cate Blanchett (as Tom's awkward love
interest) are solid, but the former is able to ignite more screen
charisma. Philip Baker Hall has a brief but effective appearance as an
American detective hired to connect the dots of a few gruesome murders.
The question of Tom's sexual preferences occasionally hangs over the
proceedings like a dour cloud of smog. There is much indication of
sexual friction between Tom and Dickie (and afterward another male
character), and although they are sometimes excessive and unnecessary,
these details only help to further establish the nature of Tom's
character. I may argue that the film is also slightly overlong, but
Minghella finishes on a particularly haunting note. `The Talented Mr.
Ripley' is full of gorgeous locales, effective imagery and subtle but
nerve-jangling suspense. It's the definition of a smart man's thriller,
and if Hitch were around to see it, I'm sure he would be envious.

Title
Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
Starring-Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman,
Eli Wallach, Anne Bancroft, Milos Forman and Ron Rifkin
Director-Edward Norton
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Touchstone Pictures - 04/00
You've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi, but never
with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
`Keeping the Faith'. It's a fluffy comedy, thoroughly glazed with a
sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer, regarding two moral topics
-- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to
collide head-on.
As youngsters, Brian Finn, Jacob Schramm and Anna Reilly were an
inseparable trio. While their friendship progressed, Anna always had the
compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so
neither would feel excluded. But tragedy soon struck, as Anna was forced
to move away. Now adults, Brian (Edward Norton) and Jacob (Ben Stiller)
hold similar but contrastive jobs. The likable and kind-hearted Father
Brian is a Catholic Priest, while the spry and outgoing Jacob acts as a
Jewish Rabbi. On the basketball court, they refer to themselves as `The
God Squad'. In the relationship field, Brian abides by his Catholic
principle of celibacy, but Jacob has reached the point where finding a
Jewish bride is practically mandatory. Everything changes when Anna
(Jenna Elfman) returns to New York to visit her childhood chums. Now a
workaholic, she devotes endless hours per week to her business, but does
find spare time to reminisce with Brian and Jacob - both ecstatic about
seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again. With these oddball
ingredients tossed into one cocktail, there's bound to be some awkward
romance between our three central characters. Predicting the outcome is
not entirely difficult, but `Keeping the Faith' is open, entertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from Point A to Point B.
Edward Norton has emerged as one of the finest, most flexibly versatile
actors in Hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded
debut in the 1996 thriller `Primal Fear'. After shockingly bitter roles
in `American History X' and, most recently, David Fincher's vicious
`Fight Club', a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar
choice. Not in the least. Norton slips into the director's chair for the
first time with `Keeping the Faith', and here his incisive, resourceful
approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive
screenplay by Stuart Blumberg. Weighing every aspect, it is unanimously
an impressive directorial debut. In addition, Norton pushes all the
right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart Brian, generating a
thoroughly likable screen presence. Stiller (the zipper guy from
`There's Something About Mary') is firm and funny, boasting a
fully-ripened comic maturity. Elfman's perky repetition can grow
tiresome (such is occasionally the case on TV's `Dharma and Greg'), but
she seems perfectly rambunctious here. The remaining cast members offer
fine support, from Anne Bancroft as Jacob's animated Jewish mom to Milos
Forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice.
`Keeping the Faith' is the perfect date flick... though perfection is
not a word to associate with the film in general. There is turbulence
during the process of lift-off, as numerous failed attempts at
establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead. Once the
film does settle in, it is often funny and always cheerful. Stiller,
Norton and Elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities.
We enjoy their interaction, understand their various dilemmas and feel
humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true. This is excluding
the ending, which is acceptable and all, but seems to lack the charm and
spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements. Nonetheless, a
narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face,
nor anyone else's in the audience. `Keeping the Faith' is a highly
enjoyable romantic comedy, although one that is more observant while
surveying the questions of love rather than religion. Aww, what the
hell. The quality is not quite heaven-sent, but this little charmer
could revive our `Faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre.

Title
Review for Life (1999)
Eddie Murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career. Known
for his notorious late 80's slump, Murphy has still managed to bounce
back with a handful of hits in the past few years. With the exception of
the dreadful Holy Man, he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged
comeback.
Life was a great move on the part of Murphy and co-star Martin Lawrence,
because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to
slap-sticky drivel. Director Ted Demme is smart enough to realize that
the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own, and
doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up. Life is, in a sense,
one great balancing act with Murphy on one end and Lawrence on the
other. Amazingly, the scale never tips in either's favor due to the
marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the
other.
As the movie opens, we're introduced to Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy), a
two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club. There he meets
a successful businessman named Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence). Somehow,
after multiple contrivances, the mismatched pair find themselves on
their way to Mississippi on a moonshine run. When all is said and done,
Ray and Claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed
by the town sheriff.
Hence the setting of Life: Mississippi State Prison, where the main
characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important, and
become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan. The film takes us from
the 30's all the way to the 90's, presenting a difficult task in showing
how the aging process affects Ray and Claude. Luckily, Rick Baker
handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic, Academy
Award caliber manner. Not only do we believe the characters look as if
they're 90 years old, but they sound like it, too. Murphy and Lawrence
are completely convincing in the lead roles, even as crotchety old cons
bickering over a game of cards. This is just one of the pleasant
surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve.
While the ads are marketing Life as a straight arrow comedy, there is a
hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core. But the comedic
aspects work wonderfully, wisely drawing strength from the talents of
the two stars. The movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama, but in
both senses, it's an overwhelming delight.
I could say a few bad things about the movie, but I don't want to. It's
such a nice surprise, such a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy and Martin
Lawrence, that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll.

Review for Friday the 13th (1980)
You can probably blame `Friday the 13th' for all the putrid, Grade-Z
slasher film garbage that amassed in the 1980's. It was so popular among
horror movie fans that endless imitations begin spawning quickly
thereafter, drowning the Hollywood market in gore. Among these
imitations were eight `Friday' sequels (you heard right), but most
sucked the big one. People couldn't get enough, apparently, so the
slasher trend continued on throughout the years. I suppose the John
Carpenter classic `Halloween' initially started the horror craze that
lasted a healthy decade, but `Friday the 13th' brought the realization
that a horror movie could be lame and cheesy but still modestly received
by the public. Actually, despite the bad rap it often takes, the
original `Friday the 13th' isn't bad at all.
In fact, in comparison to the awful clones that followed, it may be a
flat-out masterpiece. The premise: a bunch of kids travel to Camp
Crystal Lake, where they are signed up as counselors for the approaching
season. Unfortunately, even before the young campers arrive, some
mysterious killer is knocking off the sex-crazed teens in singular (and
very gory) fashion. Of course, no one realizes they are being ruthlessly
hunted down until the finale, when the sole survivor stumbles upon their
rotting corpses and erupts in screaming. To once again quote Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), the legendary `Scream' character: `Their bodies will
come popping up in the last reel somewhere. Eyes gouged out, throats
slashed...' Yes siree, Randy knows his sh-t.
Despite being a blatant rip-off of the undeniably superior `Halloween',
this entry manages to generate a fair tally of scares. The mass
murdering takes a while to get underway, bet when it does, there is some
nice tension and a few sufficient shocks. (HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD, FOR
ANYONE WHO CARES). The best of all comes when a young Kevin Bacon (who
graduated from the experience unscathed) is stabbed through a bed
mattress
with an archery arrow. That's about as inventive as the proceedings get,
but for anyone interested in researching famous horror cinema, `Friday
the 13th' is a fun and frightening little experience.
As anyone who watched `Scream' also knows, Jason Voorhees is not the
actual killer. Get ready for this shocker, boys and girls: it's his
mother!!! Yes, Mr. Voorhees doesn't do laundry or bake chocolate chip
cookies anymore - she murders people to make end's meet. But there is a
motive for these homicidal tendencies. Back in 1958, little Jason
drowned in the lake because his supervising counselors were too busy
with.... other matters. So now, the lady is out to exact revenge at the
place where she lost her beloved son. It's a real tearjerker.
As with the majority of horror films, the characters and dialogue in
`Friday the 13th' are unanimously pathetic. I will say, however, that
those aspects are more interesting than in the following sequels.
Director Sean S. Cunningham establishes a nice chill in the air, and the
elaborate death scenes deliver on a fairly reliable basis. The movie is
still relatively idiotic, though. I paid particular attention to how
efficiently Mrs. Voorhees could swing an axe while her face is off
screen. Funny, when the killer's identity is revealed and Betsy Palmer
steps in as the deranged matriarch, she can barely muscle up enough
strength to pick up a machete (and has even more trouble heaving it
toward the helpless victim). Despite this, along with numerous other
defects, `Friday the 13th' will still give you the jitters when you
watch it late at night.
Horror fanatics will definitely want to look into seeing this puppy,
mainly because it christened the most successful slasher movie franchise
in history. By all means, don't bother with any of the sequels (although
a few have some stylish attributes). Pick up this ancient fright flick
from the cobwebs at your local video store, and pop it into the VCR this
Halloween. The ending is terrible, but `Friday the 13th' is not as
unlucky as the title may suggest.

Review for Christmas Story, A (1983)
This Christmas, little Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) wants nothing
more than a Red Ryder BB Gun under the tree. Although cautioned by many
that he will shoot his eye out', Ralphie remains optimistic, conjuring
up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and
teachers. It could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with
more passion than Ralphie wants this BB Gun, and the story of his
eternal struggle is a charming one.
`A Christmas Story' is a favorite among many during the Holiday season,
and boy, it is certainly easy to see why. Ralphie's endless desire for
the BB Gun may transport you back to your childhood, when you were
craving a certain gift for Christmas and the anxiety was almost
indescribable. Evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the
many things `A Christmas Story' does so well. Here are a few features
that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during
the Holiday season:
1) Period detail. This film is based on the memoirs of late humorist
Jean Shepard, who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the
1940's with loving detail. Shepard narrates from a first person
point-of-view, divulging his various adventures one snowy December, in
which visions of taking aim with his new BB Gun replaced that of
sugarplums dancing in his head. Shepard's first-hand commentary of
several situations is not only downright hilarious, but also witty and
warm, with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the
essence of comic timing. On top of that, young Billingsley's stupefied
reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the
narration. Director Bob Clark captures the look and feel of the era with
wonderful technicality. I can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction
of what Christmas for young Ralphie must have been like.
2) Mom and Dad. Both Melinda Dillon (as mom) and Darren McGavin (as the
old man') are perfect in their roles. It's hard to fathom a more
agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one, with each
possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them
from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured. For instance,
he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound, and she is forgiving and
understanding when it comes to some serious issues. In portraying the
writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad, Peter Billingsley
has struck quite the chord. His performance is richly textured, making
all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and
enjoyment. Which brings us to....
3) The Comic Situations. There are plenty of memorable moments in `A
Christmas Story'. Moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency
upon each new viewing, with so much more to explore and to cherish. I am
particularly partial of the f-word scene', in which Ralphie blurts out
the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the
yard. Again, Shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is
nothing short of comic wizardry. The numerous sequences that stick in
one's mind include, of course, the famous department store Santa scene -
in which Billingsley has some problems in telling Old Saint Nick what he
wants under the tree.
I could go on, but I'll finish on this note: `A Christmas Story' is a
standout among Holiday movies, because it captures so much in a meager
90 minutes. Not only is it funny, it's often genuinely hilarious....not
to mention warm, fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places. I
plan on making `A Christmas Story' a Christmas tradition. Why don't you?

Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
To me, Nicolas Cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a
Martin Scorsese film. Despite the rantings that Sean Penn so rudely
expressed, the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence.
Ever since the big success of the action-thriller `Face/Off' in 1997,
the Hollywood road has been a rocky one for Mr. Cage. The perpetually
awful assassination thriller `Snake Eyes' was one of 1998's worst films.
`8MM' was a disappointing lost cause. But who better than Scorsese to
match Cage's wit and intensity, which he does in miraculous fashion with
`Bringing out the Dead'.
Cage delivers one of his finest performances as Frank Pierce, a New York
City Emergency Paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day. After
five years of the stress-inducing job, Frank basically just staggers
onward, relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift
finally ends. He also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died
under his care, namely a young girl named Rose, who stares back at him
with pale features at every street corner in New York. Frank desperately
wants to be fired, but his boss needs him to scour the city and help
those in need (`I'll fire you tomorrow...' he promises).
Frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance. The
first is Larry (John Goodman), who always has food on the brain. The
second is Marcus (Ving Rhames), a deeply religious black man who
incorporates the power of Jesus into a regular rescue operation. And
finally, Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood. I
found it unique how Scorsese used each of these characters for a single
shift with Frank, but they never figured into the actual plot. Each is
merely a colorful presence to help develop Frank's character, because
`Bringing Out the Dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and
detailed personality.
The one character alongside Frank that truly comes into play is Mary
(Patricia Arquette), the daughter of a newly admitted patient who
suffered from a severe heart attack.  Arquette, who recently received
the wounds of Christ in `Stigmata', performs well around real-life
husband Cage. It's unfortunate that, after such intriguing character
trials and tribulations, the relationship between Frank and Mary slips
during a mishandled, ineffective finale. The movie belongs to the
one-two punch of Cage and Scorsese, who were born to collaborate their
efforts in an arrangement similar to `Bringing Out the Dead'.
Although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like
`Goodfellas', Scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture.
The incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of
brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration. Fans will be
pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive, darkly
humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `Kundun'. Does
`Bringing Out the Dead' rival Scorsese's finest work? Only occasionally.
Some of the film feels surprisingly limp, but there is enough energy in
it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice.
Those expecting a grisly, risqué product may be somewhat disheartened at
the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid, admirable
effort.
`Bringing Out the Dead' was written by the acclaimed Paul Schrader, who
collaborated with Scorsese on such classics as `Taxi Driver' and `Raging
Bull'. Schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful, sharply defined
moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering
screenplay. The exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding
technical credits and the amazing cast. Goodman and Sizemore are both
electric (well, mainly Sizemore), but it's the phenomenal Ving Rhames
who deserves a second look. Watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication
as he resurrects a gothic band member, and you'll understand why he won
a Golden Globe.
`Bringing Out the Dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask
it's certain flaws. Scorsese - and Cage, for that matter - have done
better, but their intentions are certainly admirable.

Review for Best Man, The (1999/I)
Starring-Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut,
Harold Perrineau Jr. and Terrence Dashon Howard
Director-Malcolm D. Lee
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Universal Pictures - 10/99
Crafting a slick, enjoyable bachelor comedy while eluding all of the
genre pratfalls is not an easy task, but Malcolm D. Lee has done it with
=93The Best Man=94. The film does get submerged in some formula quicksand=
now and again, particularly en route toward the over-dramatic
conclusion, but Lee handles the elements skillfully. Coupled with a
young, talented African American cast, this makes =93The Best Man=94 a
brisk, highly entertaining comedy that only stutters when it tries too
hard for audience approval.
Taye Diggs is one of the most exciting young actors in Hollywood today.
After his feature debut in 1998=92s =93How Stella Got Her Groove Back=94,=
Diggs rose to electrifying new heights with the psychadelic =93Go=94 last=
year, and -- not including his tedious caricature in the scattershot
=93House on Haunted Hill=94 -- the actor revitalizes familiar material to=
make it seem fresh and exhilarating. Similar praise can be offered for
his performance in =93The Best Man=94. Diggs plays a Chicago-based author=
named Harper, who, after one last erotic rendezvous with longtime
girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan), is headed off to New York to join his
chums for a few games of friendly polker (and etc.) during a wedding day
countdown. Harper=92s latest novel, a romance about commitment and
deception, contains a few elements of real life. For that reason, he is
less than ecstatic about the notion of his buddies discovering the total
contents of the book - and is downright adamant in forbidding a few
friends even to even touch it. There=92s some horrible secret stewing
within the pages, and Harper is regretting ever publishing it.
The bachelor posse of =93The Best Man=94 is a group of fun guys. The groo=
m
is Lance (Morris Chestnut), a hulking but sensitive professional
football player who wants his bride to have a one-man policy, even if he
hasn=92t practiced a one-woman approach over the years. Murch (Harold
Perrineau Jr.) is more of the quiet type; a shy teacher who is hesitant
when it comes to expressing his true feelings. Finally, there=92s Q -- or=
Quentin (Terence Dashon Howard) -- a talented musician who has an
overbearing tendency to be a real prick. The screenplay, by Lee, makes
even the most simplistic conversation involving and intuitive. Some of
the best moments of =93The Best Man=94 occur when the boys just sit aroun=
d
and play poker, where their constant chatter is filled with bright,
fluid dialogue that keeps both eyes attentively fixed on the screen.
This makes character development light and easy, which is instantly
refreshing. =93The Best Man=94 is, essentially, a buoyant and featherweig=
ht
comedy until it dives into more dramatically preachy material as the
clock winds down. But even when it gets marred by comedic sobriety, the
film is still enjoyable.
The romantic portion of the plot is fairly elementary, but later on, the
process opens up to honesty and truthful surprise. Harper=92s love life i=
s
complicated by the resurfacing of old college flame Jordan (Nia Long),
who threatens to stir up trouble before Robin is scheduled to arrive
later on for the wedding. Director Lee, as Spike=92s cousin, has a knack
for writing perceptive dialogue exchanges, and =93The Best Man=94 is
chock-full of those. The characters, both caring and snobby, are
perfectly cast and laid-out in a manner so we can appreciate them from a
distance. This could have been a flaky, straightforward takeoff of =93The=
Big Chill=94, but thanks to proper care.... it=92s fun.
Fun because of the acting abilities of the all-black cast. Playing a
character more complex than at first glance, Chestnut is wholly
believable in juggling his two personality conditions: mean and
delicate. The most extensive showcase is provided for Diggs and Long,
who both oscillate with charming appeal and provide plenty of truthful
and funny moments. While it takes a dramatic detour during segments when
more comic filler would have been adequate, =93The Best Man=94 is still a=
swift, breezy tale of romance and personal discovery.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS at:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
Instinct is a good movie trapped in a gorilla suit of derivative clichés
and plodding ideas. The result is an occasionally powerful, extremely
well acted movie that never finds a confident emotional center.
Anthony Hopkins is a marvelous actor, with a screen presence that
commands all of the viewer's attention toward him. At first glance of
his role as Ethan Powell, a mentally disturbed anthropologist, you may
think Hopkins is reprising his role as Hannibal Lector from The Silence
of the Lambs. The character does have some of the same grisly
mannerisms, but there is one big difference: he doesn't eat people.
Still, Powell has killed two park rangers and wounded three others,
while studying gorillas on location in the jungles of Rwanda.
Called in to investigate is a young, idealistic shrink named Theo
Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who (predictably) goes at the assignment as
if it were a walk in the park. From here, Instinct relies on the study
of human behavior for interesting material. It's unfortunate that the
movie never displays it's own humanity that strongly. There are isolated
moments of sheer power, care of Hopkins and his dedicated performance,
but the film's heart is rarely in the right place at the right time.
Instinct is too uneven to be rightfully enjoyed.
The material here may have been rendered laughable if it weren't for the
acting abilities of the two leads. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and
Gooding Jr. shows fierce optimism for scene after scene of his demanding
role. Another disappointment is the lack of background supplied for the
character of Theo Caulder. We're told that he's a hot shot shrink on the
way up, but we never find out if he has a family, nor are we informed of
his roots in the psychiatric business. Donald Sutherland has a minor
role as Gooding's mentor and boss.
Even if the acting in Instinct is exceptional, it still cannot salvage
the rest of the film. The storyline is similar to countless others, like
Tarzan and The Shawshank Redemption, just to name a few. Scenes in which
we learn the explanation for Powell's psychotic behavior are undoubtedly
the most effective moments, but the presentation leaves much to be
desired.
Another conventional sub-plot involves Powell being reunited with his
daughter (Maura Tierney). But even as the film hovers around this
subject for a large portion of running time, the meeting at the end
lacks all the emotional potential that we were hoping for.
Instinct is not a bad film, but the misguided direction disables it from
shining through. Once you get past the powerful performances from the
two very capable actors, what you're left with is a troubled project
with no driving force whatsoever.

Title
Review for Story of Us, The (1999)
Don't be ashamed if you think of your marriage or relationship during
segments of `The Story of Us'. Although his presentation is problematic,
director Rob Reiner successfully navigates a mine field of clichés to
deliver a truthful and touching romance. Some may argue that the
constant, hateful bickering of the two main characters is depressing to
watch transpire. But, surprisingly, it does wonders for the one vital
element that a successful romance requires: realism.
`The Story of Us' is the story of Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis &
Michelle Pfeiffer), a separated couple who have reached the crucial
juncture of contemplating divorce. He's an accomplished writer, she's a
crossword puzzle creator - and over the course of a rocky 15-year
marriage, both have grown apart from each other. The only reason Ben and
Katie remain bonded by marriage is their two children. Even though they
have lost the spark that once lit their relationship, both want to avoid
leaving an entire family in devastated ruins due to their unfortunate
inadequacies.
Out of the gate, substantial problems surface for Reiner & company. Ben
and Katie talk directly to the camera in personal monologues to share
their separate, opinionated views. We've all become accustomed to this
approach, haven't we? But just as `The Story of Us' seems destined for
failure, Reiner straps us in and provides an overwhelming roller-coaster
of emotions. The most surprising thing is that these emotions seem
genuine and heartfelt, and not manipulative or preachy. We laugh and cry
along with these characters, because if we were placed in a similar
situation, our actions would not be indifferent. If this is a strategic
form of manipulation, then it is effective and impressively disguised.
Chalk down another point for Bruce Willis, who delivers his second
excellent performance of 1999 (the first was his restrained, effective
execution in `The Sixth Sense'). Give the man, who is normally
accustomed to firing machine guns and thwarting evil terrorists, due
credit for flexing his dramatic muscles with such success (just for the
record, Willis also gave a strong performance as an imaginary pink bunny
in Reiner's abysmal orphan comedy `North'). Pfeiffer is equally
wonderful, despite the glaring fact that her character does not possess
the clear, accentuated definition that Ben does. Both actors have
lovely, touching instances of understated power - each breaking through
the threshold to truthfully capture a moment in time. These brief
seconds are so well realized that they make `The Story of Us' worthwhile
as a whole.
What are these instances? Well, Willis has a knockout scene in which he
boils over with rage in a restaraunt, and Pfeiffer deals a climactic
speech that brought teary eyes to the majority of viewers at the
screening I attended. As good friends of the Jordan's, Rob Reiner and
Rita Wilson are highly amusing and compatible together, but the talented
Paul Reiser (as Ben's agent) gets cornered with the film's worst
material. There's an early drought that slips into unfunny, perverse
humor, but `The Story of Us' gradually develops into a real charmer.
Reiner has dealt with similar material before, namely the acclaimed
romance `When Harry Met Sally'. There's wonderful assurance behind some
of the crucial scenes, even if it feels strangely minor and trifling.
What it all comes down to is a credible, amusing and affecting tale of
two `real' people negotiating themselves through a `real' situation. If
Reiner breaks any rules, it has to be the questionable finale. But the
actors do so well painting an accurate portrait of a tumultuous
separation that it actually seems to work. It's hard to pull something
like that off, folks.
If you have the hankering for a phony, artificial romance - the
happily-ever-after type - stay away from `The Story of Us'. This is the
real dirt on the study of romance.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
`Being John Malkovich' is almost too much of a good thing. In all my
experience in motion pictures, I don't think anything as bizarre or
surreal as this film has ever arisen. It's like `Alice in Wonderful'
refitted to an episode of `The Twilight Zone', only far more imaginative
as it propels itself around each new obstacle. It's only when you're
watching that you fully realize how truly unique a spectacle `Being John
Malkovich' is. It's a wonderfully wacky breeding ground of inspired
ingenuity, a film that breaks the originality barrier in a time where
modern movie-making is accused of being nothing but recycled clichés.
`Being John Malkovich' is like one of those elaborate dreams you have
once in a while. The kind where nothing makes particular sense, when all
of your subconscious thoughts combine to form something incredibly weird
- like a dinner party with Abraham Lincoln, with the conversation
starting with `How about those Knicks?' (that's just an example). Writer
Charlie Kaufman must have had one of those dreams to spark this project.
The only other known possibility would be mind-expanding drugs. A lot of
mind-expanding drugs.
John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, an unsuccessful puppeteer looking for
work. Replying to an ad in the classified section, he travels to a New
York City office building where he hopes to get a filing job on the 7
1/2 floor. On this particular floor, the ceiling is only four feet from
the carpet. The secretary at the front desk (played by Mary Kay Place)
doesn't appear to interpret what Craig is saying. The boss, Dr. Lester
(Orson Bean), quizzes him with two separate letters and asks which
arrives earlier in the alphabet (one of the symbols is R' and the other
is a squiggly line). All of this seems very strange to Craig. One day,
while searching for a lost folder behind a cabinet, Craig discovers a
tiny door in his office. The door is a portal that transports you into
the mind of.... actor John Malkovich!! For 15 entire minutes, you are
able to see through the eyes of Malkovich as he eats his morning
breakfast or takes an evening shower. After this brief time has elapsed,
you are spit out through a subconscious loophole alongside the New
Jersey Turnpike.
Interesting, you say. Well, my dear readers, Kaufman's script takes
future twists and turns that are far more relentlessly bizarre than this
central premise. Craig tells the unbelievable story to his estranged
wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is overrun by iguanas and chimpanzees
because she works at a pet store. Also gaining the knowledge of the
Malkovich portal is Craig's voluptuous co-worker Maxine (Catherine
Keener). Together, they concoct this scheme to charge admission into the
Malkovich portal, and soon curious individuals are arriving in droves so
they can try this ultimate amusement park ride out for themselves.
The surprising thing is that there's actually some intricate
thoughtfulness behind the detailed comedy set-up. It's weird, for
certain, but there's also some genuine excitement derived from the
originality of Charlie Kaufman's screenplay. The visual treatment is
breathtaking (such as a scene in which two characters travel through
Malkovich's subconscious), but the real marvel lies behind the audacity
of the script and direction. Spike Jonze, recently seen as the fourth
soldier in `Three Kings', makes his directorial debut after sitting
behind the camera on various MTV music videos. Jonze has a keen eye for
combining both visual and intellectual detail without upsetting the
balance of the picture. It's a wild and outlandish project to handle,
but obviously Jonze was up to the challenge.
The acting (including a colorful assortment of star cameos) is uniformly
superb, but the true grit and style comes from Malkovich himself. Why
John Malkovich? I don't know, but on closer inspection of the
screenplay, he fits the demands perfectly. He's such a wonderful sport
as well. No one in `Being John Malkovich' can seem to remember what
films the actor has appeared in, despite their best efforts. For his
wonderful work here, playing an alternate version of himself from behind
the Malkovich-cam' (which contains astonishing sound effects), the
actor should receive an Oscar-nomination. `Being John Malkovich' can't
quite captivate your attention for it's entire duration, but it will
nonetheless be remembered for it's wild and daring imagination in a time
where modern film is stuck in a rut of monotonous clichés.

Review for Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)
The title `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is undeniably more catchy than
the alternative descriptions offered for a male prostitute in the film
(releasing a film called `Deuce Bigalow: Man Whore' would probably fail
to draw much of an audience). Rob Schneider, a `Saturday Night Live'
veteran who is now renowned among comedy fans for his touching portrayal
of the `you can do it!' guy in `The Waterboy', plays the title
character. Deuce is actually a fish tank cleaner who inherits the role
of being a gigolo when circumstances become extreme. Sit back and I'll
tell you the story....
Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr, `The Mummy') is a wealthy male prostitute
who requires the services of a aquarium attendant. Enter Deuce. When
Antoine is called away for an extensive business trip in Switzerland,
Deuce is left with the assignment of looking after a sick fish.
Unfortunately, Antoine's entire aquarium system is destroyed, leaving
Deuce with the daunting task of producing $6,000 for a replacement tank
before he returns (insert comedic plot-twist here). Reluctantly, Deuce
becomes a gigolo himself to raise the required amount of money in time.
Surely enough, the clients he attends to all have some kind of
ridiculous characteristic that will ensure their romantic interludes are
fall-down funny. Sorry guys, no dice.
The scatological humor in `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is often mean and
obvious, with the screenplay centering around the prime concern of
taking cheap shots at those with mental and physical disabilities. The
list of targets include the blind, the tall, the overweight, those
afflicted with Tourrets syndrome and those with prosthetic limbs. For
it's majority, `Deuce Bigalow' scrapes the very bottom of the proverbial
comedy bucket in a manner that is both disgusting and thoroughly
careless. And yet, it's sort of funny at times. Eddie Griffin has an
amusing role as a black pimp named T.J. who takes Deuce under his wing,
but too often his character is reduced to low-brow gags such as eating
various food items after they've been dipped in a hot tub. Meanwhile,
William Forsythe overacts with gritted teeth and slicked back hair as a
cop who frequently drops his pants in public to ask Deuce advice about
his manhood. As Kate, a client who Deuce falls head-over-heels for,
Arija Bareikis navigates her way to an admirable performance. Anyone who
could make us believe that Schneider has some charming characteristics
must be doing a fantastic job.
Actually, even with such a heavy burden on his shoulders, Schneider
delivers. He is not a particularly well-rounded comic, and the extra
dimension someone like Adam Sandler might possess is missing, but the
actor nonetheless does a fair job. Speaking of Sandler, this is actually
his producing debut. Rest assured, I'm sure that his company - called,
appropriately enough, `Happy Madison' - won't go bankrupt anytime soon.
`Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' is essentially a hit-and-miss comedy for
anyone craving endless potty mouth, but it does have it's charm. I know
that's hard to fathom in a breeding ground of perverse and offensive
vulgarity like this, but there are actually traces of it. The film does
have a few inspired gags up it's sleeve, too, particularly a pair of
well-executed nods to `The Matrix' that occur during elaborate battle
sequences. Unfortunately, though, this is just your typical
conglomeration of low-level humor on the whole. Perhaps,  one of these
days, the people of Hollywood will stop to ponder the idea of a decent
script being attached to a project like this. Alas, for every `There's
Something About Mary', there are ten grotesque and unfunny imitations
designed to attract only adolescent males. It has it's moments, but all
in all, `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' falls into the latter category.

MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
It's been a long time since Walt Disney has delivered us a classic along
the lines of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Sure, there
have been delightful outings like last years Hercules. But nothing
entirely groundbreaking. With the release of the studio's newest feature
length film, a remake of Edgar Rice Burrough's creation Tarzan, Disney
has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques.
It's no classic, but this new Tarzan represents exactly what a family
film should be.
The plot is loyal to the original storyline, as Tarzan's parents are
forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in
the jungles of Africa. But, they are killed (offscreen) by the snarling
cheetah Sabor, leaving baby Tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib. Found
by Kala (voiced with effective gentleness by Glenn Close), a kindhearted
mother and member of a gorilla pack, Tarzan is taken into the primate
group and raised as one of their own.
We follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various
adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend Terk (a very brash but
funny Rosie O'Donnell) and clumsy elephant Tantor (Wayne Knight). Of
course, in any Disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or
humorous chum for the hero. In Tarzan, these characters fill that space
rather inconspicuously. Gags that were magnified in other family films
are kept quite minor here. Most of the characters are amusing without
being forced.
As Tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the
picture. Here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter Clayton
(Brian Blessed), who's accompanying a hapless professor (Nigel
Hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle. Of course, there's the
professor's daughter, Jane (nicely vocalized by a cheerful Minnie
Driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie.
The thing that blew my socks off about this version of Tarzan is the
stunning animation. Directors Chris Buck and Kevin Lima have applied a
breathtaking 3-D element to the movement of the athletic title
character, and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel. As Tarzan
carries Jane through the treetops, narrowly escaping a pack of nasty
baboons, he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star
surfer riding the big wave. Your eyes can barely keep up; it's a
fantastic accomplishment.
The subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average.
There are important questions raised about Tarzan's place in the world,
and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters. There is no
shred of doubt left to ponder afterward, which is a surprising plus that
I wasn't expecting to find here. Suffice to say, this film will have
both adults and children thoroughly entertained.
The grown-up Tarzan is voiced by Tony Goldwyn, who made a name for
himself as the `big mean jerk' from Ghost. Goldwyn is effective playing
someone who's not aware of his world's dangers. Glenn Close is also
memorable as his gorilla mother, and Lance Henriksen (from TV's
Millennium) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept
the presence of a human child. As the movie's villain, there is nothing
particularly special or catching about the character of Clayton. It
helps that Brian Blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm, but he
is nothing compared to James Woods' hilarious Hades from Hercules. A
burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does
not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence.
Still, this is one great thrill-ride that Disney has constructed. I
never expected Rice Burrough's work to be transformed so successfully
from live action to animation, nor with so much emotional depth.
Parents, along with all the kiddies, are going to find much to like in
Tarzan.

Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
Starring-Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, Tim Robbins,
Jerry O'Connell, Connie Nielsen and Kim Delaney
Director-Brian De Palma
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Touchstone Pictures - 03/00
It's been hours since I returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus
`Mission to Mars', and I can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar.
Why? The movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy, stapled
carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog
the great promise of a space opera, instead shooting for the angle of a
feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001: A Space Odyssey'. I
got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were
expecting another `Armageddon'. But no, `Mission to Mars' certainly
isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster. This is a
supposedly thoughtful, family-friendly space flick in which the
apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and
uplifting drivel. You have been warned.
Of course, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not
impossible (see `Apollo 13' for an excellent example), but few directors
possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously
scarring their reputation. Brian De Palma has enough directorial
expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off. When he gets
his hands on an intelligent, systematically practical script like `The
Untouchables' or `Mission: Impossible', the director has the ability to
create a sound technical achievement (although his overly indulgent
style becomes bothersome more than occasionally). Of course, there's
also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name (including
`Snake Eyes' and the notorious bomb `The Bonfire of the Vanities')....
all of which makes me want to call De Palma the most talented hack in
Hollywood. That term may be too harsh, but if I were judging him solely
on the perpetual waste of talent that is `Mission to Mars', my choice of
words would have been slightly less lenient.
If I were Gary Sinise, I wouldn't touch De Palma with a 10-foot pole.
Sinise is a wonderful, wonderful actor, but after appearing in `Snake
Eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham, I'm sure he wouldn't want to risk
the embarrassment of a third collaboration. The Academy Award-winner
plays NASA astronaut Jim McConnell, a man who recently lost his wife
(Kim Delaney) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming
space shuttle mission to Mars (oops, forgot to mention the year - 2020).
After a barbecue get-together for the astronauts, we cut to Luc Goddard
(Don Cheadle) and his team, who are already taking measurements and
calculations on the Red Planet. Suddenly, a towering formation of rocks
and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a
whirlwind of suction. For some reason, the astronauts just stand there
calmly to admire this, as if it were a lovely piece of art. The team is
killed within seconds, expect for Luc, who was able to send one final
transmission and may still be alive.
Immediately, a second mission - consisting of astronauts McConnell,
husband and wife Woody and Terri Blake (Tim Robbins and Connie Nielsen)
and Phil Ohlmyer (Jerry O'Connell) - are dispatched to rescue Luc and
discover the mysterious secret of planet Mars. Let's put the `secret' on
hold for now, and discuss the trip there. It is explained, whether
scientifically accurate or not (probably not), that a trip to Mars takes
roughly six months. I'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind
`M2M' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension
and claustrophobia. Instead, we join the team during their final days
aboard the ship. What happened during the five months prior to this? Did
they just play cards and tell dirty jokes? Still, there are few nicely
tense moments (maybe the only in the movie) during the time-frame
involving a fuel leak. DePalma's  direction is quite good in these
scenes, although the score by Ennio Morricone is largely inconsistent
(organ music in space? C'mon).
There's a few good, imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese, a sad
realization that causes me to sigh out loud. It's a colossal bummer that
`Mission to Mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written, with a
dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated
optimists. As mentioned before, anyone looking for some disaster-movie
carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed... maybe even cheated.
After the unbelievably hokey final shot (with the words The End'
somehow adding insult to injury), a few audience members made the effort
to boo and hiss at the screen. Others muttered obscenities, shaking
their heads in disbelief while mumbling `Jeez, that sucked.' Okay, it
did suck.
But you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy... after all,
they do pretty well. Sinise is sincere and effective in many of his
scenes, Robbins and Nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving NASA
couple, and funnyman O'Connell - well, he has a couple lines are
actually amusing (and intentionally so). The digital effects
accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive. So, by
golly, where did this `Mission' go wrong? Looking back on the appalling
experience, I would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it
could have. While watching `Mission to Mars', my suggestion would be to
immediately abort, or better yet, don't even strap yourself in for
lift-off.

Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
Starring-Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, Gary Sinise, James Frain,
Dennis Farina, Danny Trejo, Clarence Williams III and Donal Logue
Director-John Frankenheimer
Canadian Rating-14A
Is it somehow bending the rules of screenwriting not to insert the
intended title of your project into a script nowadays? We witnessed it
just last week in `The Whole Nine Yards', in which a certain character's
vocabulary stumbled over the phrase, even though it didn't necessarily
apply. It's a similar case with `Reindeer Games', a limp new heist
thriller utterly devoid of the kinetic energy and stimulating action
that it requires to heat up the cineplex during the snowy season. The
villain, a shaggy, long-haired trucker named Gabriel (Gary Sinise,
channeling Lieutenant Dan from `Forrest Gump') stands over our
protagonist Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) with gun in hand. In a moment of
questioning Rudy's honesty, Gabriel threatens him by incorporating
Rudolph & Co. into the conversation: `Don't you play no reindeer games
with me.' Now, what exactly are reindeer games'? The term is fairly
vague. Originally, I thought it was a catchy title for a
Christmas-oriented action/adventure, but having a character utter it so
deliberately is just plain goofy.
Granted, there are bigger problems with `Reindeer Games' and its overly
trite, fatigue-ridden script (written by flavor-of-the-month Ehren
Kruger, the `Scream 3' scribe). After a striking opening collage of
snow-covered imagery, we cut to a Michigan prison environment. In for
auto theft, Rudy and his cellmate Nick (James Frain) are eagerly
anticipating their release in a mere two days - Nick in particular, who
has been carrying on a steamy postal relationship with a beautiful
pen-pal named Ashley Mercer (Charlize Theron). But in the aftermath of a
violent cafeteria scuffle, Nick is stabbed to death. This leaves Rudy in
a certain dilemma of conscience: once he sees Ashley outside the prison,
should he explain the tragic situation or walk on by? Ignoring those
options, Rudy does something really absurd... he poses as Nick. Having
never seen a photo of the real Nick, Ashley will not be able to identify
the impostor, leaving the cute couple with a sexy Christmas holiday for
roasting chestnuts on the open fire.
The situation, however, is complicated by Gabriel - Ashley's criminal
brother. Gabriel and his elite team of gun-runner underlings (Danny
Trejo, Clarence Williams III and Donal Logue) want to take down The
Tomahawk, a wealthy casino built on an Indian reservation. To do this,
they require Nick's expertise of the structure and the security, some
knowledge he would have attained from working at The Tomahawk a few
years back. Unfortunately, Gabriel and his goons don't have Nick....
they have Rudy posing as Nick. Kruger proceeds to complicate matters
even further, tossing in a few 360 degree twists and thickening the
mixture drastically as the casino robbery nears execution. It may read
like a made-for-cable plotline, but Kruger's premise is both a clever
and promising set-up for high-wire action/adventure. Imagine my
disappointment when I realized how sluggish and unexciting `Reindeer
Games' actually was. It's a thriller of perplexing tedium, limply
directed by aging legend John Frankheimer (`The Manchurian Candidate'),
which is a surprising pratfall given his last film was the rousing chase
film `Ronin'. The fact that `Reindeer Games' is thoroughly lacking
visual flair and animation coupled with the detached presentation of a
few action sequences makes for... well, a rather ho-hum experience.
The proverbial nail in the coffin, however, was an insipid move that
Kruger could now label his trademark punch: the final twist. It worked
marvelously for him in the terrorist thriller `Arlington Road', but here
Kruger indulges to the point of idiocy. No one will be able to foresee
such a doozy of a twist, but that doesn't mean it's clever - a better
choice of words would be ludicrous and illogical. Kruger does have the
talent to make a name for himself in the screenwriting underworld of
Hollywood. His script for `Reindeer Games' is not a total loss, with a
pair of genuinely funny one-liners and a handful of inventive moments
sprinkled with humor and suspense. He just underestimates the
intelligence of the audience too often.
Tis a shame, because Frankenheimer does coax a few enjoyable
performances from Sinise (taking the villainous grunge look to new
extremes) and Theron (beautiful and light-footed wherever her travels
take her). Affleck has trouble convincing us that he's an ex-con, but he
does alright. While not totally defective in the suspense department,
`Reindeer Games' doesn't succeed at much anything. It's a mediocre
mystery, a lazy action film and a decidedly unfestive Christmas movie.
Let the `Games' begin.... at your own risk, of course.

Title
Review for High Fidelity (2000)
Starring-John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso,
Joan Cusack, Lisa Bonet, Tim Robbins and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Director-Stephen Frears
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Touchstone Pictures - 03/00
There's just something about John Cusack, isn't there? His offbeat sense
of humor and quirky idiosyncrasies have been meticulously evident
throughout the actor's career. From `Say Anything' to `Grosse Point
Blank', everything is intact, and to such an extent that I'm sure
certain individuals believe he's always played the same character. `High
Fidelity' does little else but continue the curious trend, with Cusack
doing strict Cusack, but progression is attained nonetheless. How does
he manage it? It always helps to have a fresh and limber screenplay in
which the comedic whimsy is worthy of Cusack's eccentric charm. `High
Fidelity' is, in turn, more than worthy.
Ever since a brief liaison under the football bleachers in grade 7, Rob
Gordon (Cusack) has been cursed with a romantic hex. All of his
relationships seem to hinge on some essential bond of devotion or love,
and every time, Rob blows it. Now, he owns a record store called
Championship Vinyl, and toils over his current possible break-up with
Laura (Iben Hjejle), who -- *gasp* -- may be the one he's been searching
for all along. The early structure of `High Fidelity' is built around
presenting Rob's Top Five Break-ups', which we see in amusing
chronological flashbacks. The casting in these scenarios ensures some
fun and potential surprise for audience members. Catherine Zeta-Jones
appears, sporting a deck of snobbish qualities, as a controlling
romantic interest who spews dialogue in rapid-fire bursts. And then
there's Lili Taylor, returning to comfortable ground after `The
Haunting', playing a timid partner who seems like a perfect match for
Rob.
`High Fidelity' spins a surprisingly affectionate romantic yarn that
simmers quietly under the surface without ever boiling over. This
eventually generates a sense of observant charm, which is so slight and
unanticipated that it may catch you off-guard. In addition, the cast is
populated with well-realized characters whom every actor seems perfectly
tailored for. Some of the most seasoned comedy is derived from Rob's two
employees: Barry (Jack Black), a rash and egotistical jerk who grills
any customer who wishes to buy a crummy record, and Dick (Todd Louiso),
a bashful but friendly music fanatic who seems hesitant to do anything.
Both actors are perfect in their respective roles, but Black goes
directly to town as Barry, lighting up the silver screen in a bombastic
showcase of astonishing energy that jacks up the entertainment level a
good two or three notches. John's sister, Joan Cusack, appears welcomely
as a mutual friend of Rob and Laura's. Rounding out the supporting cast
is the ceaselessly wonderful Tim Robbins, hilarious as an aging
spiritual hipster who becomes romantically entangled with Laura. A
confrontation with he and Rob, in which three alternate `Scooby Doo'
situations are presented, is manic and inspired.
`High Fidelity', based on the novel by Nick Hornby, only stumbles over a
few thematic elements. In the screen translation, Rob's character seems
to be confined at times, and lacking the edge and prickly cynicism that
his romantically-challenged character would probably envelop. Director
Stephen Frears (`The Grifters') uses the continual device of Rob talking
directly into the camera to explain his various predicaments. Thanks to
Cusack's spontaneity and distinguished range, this usually works, but
Rob's chats with the audience occasionally grow tiresome because they
lack a certain dimension of character. But no bother. Cusack, even with
the sporadic instance of jarred emotions, manages to excel in presenting
an offbeat character.... as he always does. It is pretty standard
terrain, but Frears hits the nail of relationships on the head, and
everyone seems to evolve to the liking of the viewer. Take Cusack's
effortless chemistry with `Cosby' girl Lisa Bonet, playing a beautiful
young singing talent, and you get the basic gist of the balmy approach
that `High Fidelity' is gunning for.
I was surprised at how efficiently `High Fidelity' achieved some
decisive romantic truth. It's a sweet, enjoyable motion picture,
peppered with observant chuckles and immensely likable performances.
It's familiar turf for Cusack, but `High Fidelity' sheds some gentle
light on the awkward state of dating and relationships, and gets inside
the head of your average single male. Yes, that's one small step for
John Cusack, one giant leap for mankind.

Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
Retelling the classic story of Joan of Arc has been a popular trend this
year. Earlier this May, Leelee Sobieski played the passionate title role
in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on CBS. And now, director Luc
Besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage
girl supposedly sent by God to rescue France from the clutches of their
enemies. Starring Milla Jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing as
the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch, `The Messenger: The
Story of Joan of Arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical
re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the
famous legend.
Besson (who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `The Fifth
Element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife Jovovich,
because in `The Messenger', the actress
is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. At first, when reports
were indicating that Jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role,
I was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of
such a caliber. After seeing the rousing trailer, my
hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - Milla Jovovich looked superb.
With the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance, `The Messenger'
looked like a timeless epic in the making.
A timeless epic it is not. Besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and
flashy style, and the
story behind `The Messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands. On
the shoulders of
Besson's choppy and unexciting direction, the film dissipates into an
uninspiring
hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery.
There is no human exploration into the character of Joan (or Jeanne).
Jovovich merely rambles on about the
power of God when we have little or no insight into her visionary
objective. Jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the
realization that Besson sees Jeanne as a piece
of spiritual cardboard. She is just another special effect in this
continuous visual feast.
Jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power, but mainly,
she looks lost. Quite frankly, I don't know of any actress who could
successfully navigate her way through `The Messenger' without a major
fumble. The script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate
comedy, as Jeanne confronts the uncrowned King Charles VII (John
Malkovich) and informs him of her heavenly intentions. Faye Dunaway
plays Charles' overbearing mother-in-law, and Dustin Hoffman appears
over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed The Conscience'.
All three actors juggle limited screen time, although Malkovich is
uncharacteristically awful.
The battle scenes are extremely bloody, but with the presence of such
jittery camera work, they capture none of the excitement or finesse of
something like `Braveheart'. There's a particularly graphic and
unsettling scene early on, when Jeanne (as a young girl) watches in
horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely
raped by a bloodthirsty English soldier. Even his fellow troopers are
petrified.
`The Messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story.
Almost too 90's, it seems. There's gratuitous use of the f-word and a
barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts!' sprinkled throughout the
screenplay. I was half-expecting Jeanne to invite her homeys to come
chill in her crib, but it never happened. There's also the familiar
presence of bizarre Besson humor, but none of it comes even remotely
close to functioning properly. It seems terribly misplaced, but in a
catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `The Messenger', almost
everything does.
The musical score by Erric Serra is spectacular, and the set and
production designs are continuously impressive. If it was visual
excellence that Besson was striving for, then he achieves his goal. But
the only time the dramatics come alive in `The Messenger' is during the
closing trial, in which Jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake.
During these moments, the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of
Joan of Arc reaches the audience, albeit in a faint stream of light that
provokes little power or meaning. It's just too delayed for Besson to
revive his lifeless interpretation, in which he is always concerned with
the wrong aspects.
`The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome
historical addition to the Hollywood shelf. Anyone searching for an
entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and
confusing film. Despite my original hopefulness, Milla Jovovich is not
going to have to worry about thanking the Academy.

Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
I remember making a pact, right after `Patch Adams', to not be easily be
suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality. But darn it, `Music of
the Heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright
characterizations. It's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill
with it's manipulation. In addition, it's also a terrific family film.
This is the true story of violin teacher Roberta Guaspari, who fought
the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of
inner city Harlem schools. It could also be described as `Mrs. Streep's
Opus'.
Yes, Meryl Streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of
Guaspari, and that brings both good news and bad. Out of the gate,
possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing,
it is relatively difficult to identify with Roberta's character and
grasp her academic point-of-view. She is very strict with her students,
but what insight does that create into the story? Slowly but surely, we
begin to recognize the intentions of the character, and show admiration
for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that Streep has once again
applied.
One thoroughly interesting fact about `Music of the Heart' lies with the
unlikely presence in the director's chair: horror veteran Wes Craven.
After leaving an impression with the `Scream' films and the original
`Nightmare on Elm Street', Craven has attempted a precarious cross-over
to drama. At first, his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious,
but as the film progresses Craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche
with directing this material. It doesn't carry the heart-warming courage
of `Mr. Holland's Opus', but `Music of the Heart' is casually assured
and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth. The tag team of Streep
and Craven works better than you would anticipate.
Yes, Oscar could come calling once again for Meryl Streep, but it's the
solid ensemble cast that makes `Music of the Heart' work. Angela Bassett
displays her usual forceful stamina as Janet Williams, the principal at
an inner city school who initially doesn't hire Roberta because of her
lack of experience. Blue-eyed Adian Quinn is endearing, as always,
playing a new love interest. Gloria Estefan also delivers in the tiny
role of a supportive second-grade teacher, and the three lead actresses
together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force. It's like a
schoolteacher's version of `Thelma and Louise', in a restrained but
effective manner.
The movie tackles more issues than just Guaspari's teaching of violin.
There's some powerful moments between Roberta and her two sons, who must
cope when their father leaves them for another woman. In it's dramatic
build-up, the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling
and warmth. It's a good movie for anyone to see, although missing out on
the experience would not be a life-altering decision.
It's commendable of Wes Craven to be attempting such a difficult
cross-over, and also for achieving his intricate goal. Watching this
heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments, who may ask
yourself: This is the guy who directed `Scream'? Of course, when the
third installment of that series comes around in February 2000 (with
Craven directing), you may find yourself wondering: This is the guy who
directed `Music of the Heart'? Mission accomplished, Wes.
Thankfully, there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film.
In it's entirety, it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole
family, despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile.
The child actors are cute and perform up to par, even if some of their
problems are clichéd and predictable in the extreme. The mother who
doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music', the unexpected
casuality... basically everything is there.
It doesn't strike the perfect chord, but `Music of the Heart' is highly
convincing. The uplifting true story of Roberta Guaspari could have been
told better, but `Music of the Heart' is still edifying enough to
properly divulge her morals.

Review for Pitch Black (2000)
Starring-Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser,
Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald and Rhiana Griffith
Director-David Twohy
Canadian Rating-14A
Total crap. That would be the most accurate choice of words when
describing the majority of sci-fi monster movies that have been exposed
to in the past few years. Characters were pursued down flooded cruise
liner hallways by fake tentacles (`Deep Rising'), stalked by robotic
aliens (`Virus') and swarmed by ugly flying mammals (`Bats'). And let's
not forgot this January's `Supernova'. Holy Lord, did that movie reek.
But before you reject `Pitch Black', a science-fiction film with no
A-list stars or special trimmings, keep in mind that director David
Twohy is behind the camera. You may recollect that Twohy's directorial
debut was the highly intelligent (and highly underappreciated) alien
takeover film `The Arrival'. Sure, Charlie Sheen was in it, but the film
was executed with an unusual aura of imagination and style. Twohy also
co-scripted the excellent cat-and-mouse thriller `The Fugitive' in 1993,
so with `Pitch Black', I was expecting more than just a bloody parade of
stock characters pitted in unoriginal situations. There was also my
knowledge that, in addition, Twohy penned `Waterworld'.... but hey, we
all make mistakes.
`Pitch Black' opens with a bang. A transport ship carrying several
passengers and some particularly dangerous cargo collides with space
debris and plummets through the stratosphere in an astounding 10-minutes
of seat-gripping disorientation. The unscheduled landing site is a
desolate, seemingly uninhabited desert planet with three suns. The
handful of survivors include captain Fry (Radha Mitchell), the
strong-minded heroine with more than a dash of Ripley in her soul,
rugged lawman Johns (Cole Hauser), and the dangerous cargo - a murderous
convict by the name of Riddick (Vin Diesel). Riddick's chilling opening
narrative defines his character to a tee: `They say in cryo-sleep, the
only part of you that doesn't shut down is the primitive side...the
animal,' he says.  `I guess that's why I'm still awake.' When Riddick
frees himself from his confinement to roam the planet by foot, the
remaining passengers get spooked. But what they really should be
concerned about is the local wildlife: an endless swarm of nocturnal
creatures that could be described as carnivorous hammerhead
pterodactyls. Luckily, they only attack at night. Johns has a
breakthrough: `They seem to stick to darkness, so if we stick to
daylight, we should be alright.'
And then, a total eclipse occurs. Isn't that always the luck of
characters in this type of movie? At any rate, the survivors must
scramble across the desert plain with the necessary amount of energy
cells they will require to takeoff. The real question at hand is this:
placed in a life-threatening situation, will Riddick help the crew or
flee for the sake of his own freedom? Would you believe that this, the
extra dimension of character development, is one standout factor that
makes `Pitch Black' so refreshing? Tis true. The screenplay, by Twohy
and brothers Jim and Ken Wheat (who penned several forgettable sci-fi
movies), is a competent tension builder that boasts an absorbing set-up
and some palpable character interaction. There are memorable scenes, all
stemming from the character of Riddick. Inman (Keith David), the leader
of a small group of Islamic pilgrims, approaches Riddick to question his
faith in God. The timid English boozehound Paris (well-played by Lewis
Fitz-Gerald) is positively horrified of him, and finally there's the kid
(Rhiana Griffith), who wants to be Riddick.
Diesel, tough and lean, makes quite the lasting impression. But the real
star here is the alien foe - a massive, skittering army of clawed
monsters, sensationally well-devised and sleek in their appearance.
Twohy builds tension nicely by keeping the creatures in the shadows
until the eclipse, when they emerge from under the planet's surface in
tremendous numbers. All around, the visual effects - including the
well-edited crash sequence - are top-of-the-line in quality, despite the
relatively meager budget.
The script offers us intelligence, but it eventually degenerates into a
leftover creature feature ghoulash. The stylish, visually polished
appearance of `Pitch Black', often bleached out in a manner reminiscent
of the Gulf War comedy `Three Kings', is the film's most vital
component. Effective images such as the towering skeletonized remains of
past inhabitants are scattered across the alien landscape, and the
cinematography is spellbinding. The only time Twohy really indulges is
during a few attack sequences which reveal that he could have graduated
from the Brian DePalma school of editing; these fast, choppy cuts are
rather ineffective. My major complaint was the lack of action during the
2nd act. This all changes, however, when the lights go down and the
beasties come out to play...and not in a friendly sense.
All three primary actors - Diesel, Mitchell and Hauser - do splendidly
with building their characters. `Pitch Black' offers some aspects that
regular science-fiction does not: characters that we can identify with,
a thoughtful visual look, and a few genuine surprises for such a
simplistic plot. So, without further ado, sci-fi fans may rejoice: the
sleek, intelligent `Pitch Black' is superior monster mayhem.

Review for Thirteenth Floor, The (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
A good sci-fi is hard to come by these days. For every ingenious,
mind-boggling rarity like The Matrix, there are half a dozen idiotic
atrocities such as Virus. Where does The Thirteenth Floor come into
play? Somewhere in the middle, I should think.
During every twist and turn of this movie, you can sense the abundance
of good ideas stirring. The problem is, these ideas are never allowed to
escape, and the experience were left with putters along for an
incredibly hollow two-hour running time. Director Joseph Rusnak
obviously thinks that less is more. Well, in a situation like The
Thirteenth Floor, more would have definintely been appreciated.
The story involves brilliant scientist Hammond Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), whos created a possible link to a parallel dimension; a
visual simulation that allows the user to be transported circa 1937 and
experience the old days. As we soon learn, Fuller has something very
important to tell a co-worker of his named Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko).
But before he successfully passes on the message, he is brutally stabbed
to death by an unknown assailant outside a bar. The first twenty minutes
of The Thirteenth Floor contain just the right dosage of intrigue and
paranoia, but the story soon dissipates into a jigsaw puzzle that never
gets finished. It has the right pieces, but never uses them quite right.
Yes, this film does have obvious comparisons to Dark City, eXistenZ and
The Matrix. But its approach is so laid-back and boring you dont seem
to care. Even when the plot gets up into high gear (if thats what you
want to call it), you still want it to go that extra yard.
The premise is quite intriguing, but I needed far more convincing. In
the last third, theres an interesting sub-plot that delves into the
question of what is reality? Could it be possible that their world is
also a simulation, and that Fullers creation had already been
experimented with and they were the resulting product? Could their world
be a mere fabrication for others enjoyment? The Thirteenth Floor raises
so many questions, but unfortunately very few are answered for our
convenience.
The cast has a fun time playing dual, or sometimes triple roles with
this scenario. Vincent DOnofrio plays a present day computer programmer
named Whitney, but also the tight-fisted bartender Ashton in 1937.
Gretchen Mol is unfairly wasted as a mysterious woman charading as
Fullers daughter, but also as a part-time clerk at a grocery store. The
one actor who plays just a single character is Dennis Haysbert,
captivating yet underused as a LAPD detective on the case.
With all of its shortcomings, its thankful the visual appearance of The
Thirteenth Floor is both diverting and impressive. There are marvelous
old-fashioned crane shots that cover the towering, shimmering buildings
of present day Los Angeles, and the 30s are shown with convincing
effect.
Its really too bad that The Thirteenth Floor couldnt have amounted to
more. It had the potential to be a great science-fiction film. Its
always important to have a strong premise in this sort of film, but the
payoff is even more vital. The rising action will set the audience up,
hopefully captivate them for long enough, until the much needed payoff
takes over and carries a movie to a sturdy finish. The Thirteenth Floor
has nothing of the kind.
This is not a bad film, when it comes down to it. The intelligence and
creativity are above average for the genre, the actors are competent
enough to carry the project... where, pray tell, did it all go wrong? I
believe the answer to that lies within the directors choice to
completely ignore the third (and most important) act. The material here
would have gone a long way, if the movie was about 30 minutes long.

Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) (TV)
`How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' is a Holiday tradition for many
families, in the same regard as the Christmas turkey or decorations on
the tree. I, myself, can hardly think of a more rewarding manner to
spend a snowy evening in December than curling up and watching this
Holiday gem. It's 26 minutes of warmth, humor and moralizing that clicks
perfectly upon every viewing.
Everybody knows the Grinch. He is a pudgy, reprehensible green creature
with spindly fingers and a wicked heart that is two sizes too small. He
looks down from his desolate mountain cave toward the citizens of
Whoville, furrowing his brow and frowning the most hateful of frowns.
The Grinch is completely fed up with the Christmas celebrations of the
Who's: their annual singing at Town Square, the pretty decorations they
put up, and all of the aggravating noise that results from the Who girls
and boys playing with their new toys. The Grinch devises a plan - an
evil plan - to put a stop to all of this warmth and jubilation in
Whoville. He will disguise himself as Santa Claus, ride down the
mountainside in a sleigh, and steal all of the presents and decorations
in the happy little town.
`How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' is full of delightful Seussian humor,
which makes sense, because it was originally written by the incomparable
Dr. Seuss (aka Theodor Geisel, the King of rhyme). Some of the toy names
are particularly inventive in all of their exuberant, tongue-twisting
glory. And the musical numbers are absolutely wonderful, with everything
from the more traditional `Trim up the Tree' to my personal favorite,
the low-octave charmer `You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch'. The film is
narrated by the legendary Boris Karloff to sheer perfection, and the
three central characters are each memorable in their own separate way.
The Grinch himself is a villain to be remembered, his dog (or unwilling
reindeer) is cute and affectionate in his shy attempts to please his
master, and Cindy Loo Who (a tiny girl who stumbles upon `Santa' in the
act) is adorable. With all of this fun and imagination at work, how
could you not love this movie?
`The Grinch' originally aired on television in 1966, but it has grew in
popularity with every passing year. The animation is certainly nothing
special, but for the demands of a children's story, it is perfectly
rendered. Most importantly, `How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' strives
for a moral that everyone in the family can learn from. This Christmas,
dedicate a mere 26 minutes to this Holiday classic. `The Grinch' is one
Yuletide selection that will always be welcome in my book.

Title
Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at: http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
The Sixth Sense is a genuine, unexpected treasure in a summer plagued
with severe disappointments (The Haunting, Deep Blue Sea). It manages to
be creepy, unsettling, heart-felt and emotionally satisfying all at the
same time.
Is there a minimum age required for an Oscar nomination? If not, an
early suggestion would be Haley Joel Osment for his amazing performance
in this film. Osment, from Bogus and Forrest Gump, is the most talented
and credible child actor to grace the good screen in years. His tears of
sadness and despair are so frighteningly real it will give you
goosebumps. The mediocrity of a younger actor's performance often
downplays the overall effect of a film like this, but The Sixth Sense is
definitely not the case.
Bruce Willis, in a welcome change of pace, plays child psychologist
Malcolm Crowe. Crowe has been praised for his efforts for helping the
city's children, and awarded with a framed commendation plaque from the
mayor. On the celebration night, he and his wife (Olivia Williams) are
breaking out the champagne when they discover an intruder has entered
their home. It's a former patient (played by Donnie Wahlberg), who is
blaming Crowe that he was of no help to him during the sessions they had
years ago. Despite attempts to calm him down, the frightened man shoots
the good doctor and then turns the gun on himself.
Skip to `Next Fall', where Crowe is now a shadow of his former self. His
new patient is eight-year old Cole Sear (Osment), a social outcast who
is haunted by something he can't explain. His mother (Toni Collette) is
seriously concerned about the strange bruises and cuts forming on Cole's
wrists and back, but she too is totally unaware of the boy's serious
condition. After a few sessions discussing his parents' divorce, the boy
begins to feel more secure with Dr. Crowe. And so Cole works up the
courage to tell him his secret: `I see dead people,' he says. `Walking
around like regular people.'
The Sixth Sense is not a traditional thriller by any means. Director M.
Night Shyamalan (who directed another film with a spiritual angle called
Wide Awake) has crafted a sensational little drama that will chill your
spine and warm your heart both at once. The emotional maturity that
Shyamalan displays in the second half is wonderful and surprising. There
are frightening moments and shocking images, but the overall emotions
displayed here will have you uplifted while leaving the theater
This is Bruce Willis' best performance.... well, ever. The actor
displays incredible power and realism with his character that comes as
an unexpected fulfillment. The scenes between Willis and young Osment
strike the perfect tone. The lines are perfectly delivered, the emotions
are played perfectly, and their relationship is marvelously realized and
never artificial. Actually, it seems as if the adult actors are given
new opportunities to shine whenever around the extraordinary Osment. The
relationship between Cole and his mother is also touching and
well-balanced, and never altered by any kind of emotional fakery. The
directions The Sixth Sense will take you are unexpected and extremely
effective right until the end (and I do mean the very end).
The Sixth Sense is probably the best movie I've seen all year. It's an
amazing, unparalleled and fulfilling experience. The performances are
virtually flawless, the screenplay is consistently well-written, the
dialogue is totally absorbing, and the direction leaves little margin
for error. The final twist of the film is so clever and unexpected that
you will ponder it for weeks afterward. On closer inspection, it may
contain certain flaws, but it remains the most marvelous and surprising
finale I've seen in years. This is a movie that you simply can't miss.

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
Starring-Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock,
Alan Rickman, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Salma Hayek and Jason Lee
Director-Kevin Smith
Rated 14A
Lions Gate Films
A movie that has arose continuous controversy this year is Kevin Smith's
new comedy `Dogma'. The film was said to be deeply offensive toward
Catholics in it's manner of using organized religion as a basis for
comedy. Smith offers a disclaimer before the events in `Dogma' even
commence, stating that the film is not to be taken seriously and that
it's a work of comedic fantasy. He adds that `even God has a sense of
humor - just look at the platypus' (afterward, an apology is made to
platypus fanatics, but that's a different story).
In handling it's religious views, `Dogma' is certainly not as offensive
as you've been told. Smith actually takes the deep Catholicism quite
seriously, posing intriguing questions and answering them with a great
deal of faith and understanding. While not one of the best
films of the year, `Dogma' is a thoroughly interesting experience full
of surprising audacity.
Two fallen angels named Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck)
have been inhabiting the city of Wisconsin after they were banned from
Heaven for all eternity. Upon the arrival of an unidentified newspaper
clipping, the pair realize a possible way to re-enter the pearly gates:
a loophole in the Catholic dogma found in a church in New Jersey.
Passing through the arch at this church would grant them a trip back
into Heaven, but at the same time, it would wipe out all of human
existence. Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, is dispatched to
find the Last Scion' (or the savior of all human kind). The Scion is
none other than abortion clinic employee Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who
must prevent Loki and Bartleby's passage into the church. Assisting her
are the two unlikely street prophets Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob
(director Smith), although they mainly just obsess about beautiful women
and smoke a lot of pot. Reprising their roles from `Clerks', `Mallrats'
and `Chasing Amy', Mewes and Smith are now (I'm convinced) two of the
funniest characters in modern cinema.
Along their trek to New Jersey, more heavenly assistance is sent. Rufus
(Chris Rock), who claims to be the unknown 13th Apostle, falls out of
the sky and lands on the highway pavement in the nude. Jay and Silent
Bob encounter Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse turned stripper who
claims responsibility for 19 of the 20 top-grossing films of all time.
Following our saviors is the horned demon Azrael (Jason Lee) and his
three roller-blading henchmen. I suppose `Dogma' is somewhat of a road
movie, and like most road movies, there are times the pace lags and the
interest is inconsistent.
There are also plenty of moments when the humor is side-splitting. The
duo of Mewes and Smith constantly delivers (Mewes with the punchline,
Smith with the deadpan reaction). As the leading heroine, Fiorentino has
too little to do with her important agenda, but the remainder of the
cast is solid and well-balanced. Damon and Affleck have always performed
well together, and here they provide the film's most thought-provoking
moments. Examine the scene in which Loki and Bartleby grill a group of
board members on their past sins, and you'll realize that `Dogma'
functions on separate levels than a simple religious comedy.
The remarkable script, written by Smith, covers a lot of unlikely bases
with a surprising amount of success. There's a hefty dose of cartoonish
violence thrown in (such as a sequence that could be dubbed Attack of
the Excrement Monster'), but none of it is particularly unsettling
because it looks purposely fake. Critic Roger Ebert has written that
perhaps non-Catholics should be issued a catechism at the door, but I
think the material doesn't lean that deeply into spirituality. `Dogma'
provides honest laughs and is sure to please the majority of Smith's
loyal followers (if they have forgiven him for `Mallrats'), but at the
same time, it's a bit of a departure for the acclaimed writer/director.
This film certainly has more widespread issues and pervasive violence,
but Smith never loses grasp, although he slips a bit in the occasional
interval of boring dialogue. An interesting move: Alanis Morisette has a
cameo as God. Isn't that ironic? (ha, ha... never mind).
Offensive? I don't think so. I would simply call `Dogma' a revelation of
truthful and interesting comedy.

Title
Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
The Thomas Crown Affair, a remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen romance of
the same name, is a glossy star vehicle with an attractive surface but
an empty shell. While you will probably enjoy the star chemistry, the
film lacks a certain urgency. And those expecting present 007 Pierce
Brosnan to be dodging explosions and attempting death-defying stunts
should look elsewhere. This remake follows a more laid-back and
conventional pace, but it still can be fun.
Brosnan plays a wealthy art lover named Thomas Crown who steals
expensive paintings because, well, he likes to. His latest heist has
aroused some suspicion. After an ingeniously crafted caper in a museum
involving a group of hired goons and a decoy helicopter, the insurance
company sends in a representative by the name of Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo) to investigate. Banning, with a striking fashion sense and a very
floppy hairdo, manages to piece together the heist in a few brief
moments of scanning the video surveillance. But the identity of the
(very bright) burglar is still unanswered.
Working with detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary), Banning works fast.
She attends a party uninvited, wearing a very revealing dress, and gets
to know Mr. Crown a little better. She knows this debonair businessman
is the thief, but she can't find the evidence to prove it. The chemistry
between Brosnan and Russo in this film is not a noticeable strong point.
They work well enough on an individual basis, but don't create enough
believable sparks together to make their relationship click properly.
Pierce Brosnan perhaps wasn't the best actor to take over for Steve
McQueen, because he's lacking more than a few striking attributes that
the latter was known for. But his performance is slick enough to hide
these drawbacks. Russo's role, also maybe better suited to a different
actress, is still the stronger one. She has never looked better. Perhaps
casting wasn't the most persuasive part of The Thomas Crown Affair, but
the actors are in top form.
The 2nd act of this film struggles valiantly to hold the viewer's
attention. The director is John McTiernan, who is far more accustomed to
helming big-budget action films (he was behind the camera for Die Hard
and Predator). Perhaps it's his direction, but most of The Thomas Crown
Affair feels somewhat stiff. The actors and scenery are pretty, the
set-up is well staged, but there is little push behind the initial
story. Everything seems to meander along slowly until the last fifteen
minutes, which contain just enough clever twists and turns to keep us
interested. If there had been more focus on this sneaky little fun, the
majority of the plot could have moved smoother (the opposite goes for
Entrapment, which was fun and exciting but rarely stopped to establish
character details).
The presence of Denis Leary as the bickering detective helps. Leary is a
gifted comic actor who adds some zest to the story, although I did want
more from his character. There's also Faye Dunaway, the original
insurance investigator in the 1968 version, playing Crown's psychiatrist
and having fun doing so. Inserting Dunaway in more than just a brief
cameo appearance was another wise move. Little additions like this one
can prove very effective when carefully scattered throughout a movie.
An action film this ain't. The Thomas Crown Affair is more like a
long-shot romance with a detailed back story to support it. It has a
tendency to be very entertaining, but the lack of a real 2nd act nearly
sinks it. The actors are charming, but can't scrounge up enough sparks
to keep the momentum flowing. This film has a great opening, a memorable
finale, but what's left in-between leaves something to be desired.

Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
The popularity of the masked sword-fighter Zorro has plummeted since his
rise to fame in the 1930's. With the appearance of famed superheroes
Batman and Superman in their first feature-length films, Zorro had to
take a back seat. After all, he had no super powers. With the release of
the swashbuckling epic The Mask of Zorro, the franchise has been
revitalized with more potential than anyone had originally foreseen.
As if one Zorro was not exciting enough, The Mask of Zorro gives us two.
The original man in black is Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), a
savior of the Mexican people. In a thrilling prologue, De La Vega is
thwarting the plans of the greedy and careless governor of Mexico, Don
Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson). Afterward, like a medieval Batman riding
a horse through the caves and back to his mansion, we meet his wife
Esperenza and beautiful baby daughter lying peacefully in her crib. But
Montero somehow traces his steps, and Esperenza is accidentally killed
in a struggle. De La Vega is sent of to prison, and Montero whisks his
daughter away to raise her as his own.
Twenty years later, De La Vega finds the chance to escape from prison
once he learns that Montero is back, and has plans to make California
into an Independent Republic. While at first De La Vega plots instant
revenge on his sworn enemy, he sees his daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones),
now fully grown and by Montero's side. He can't bring himself to finish
the deed with such personal issues now in consideration.
Luckily for De La Vega, another young rogue exists that has a personal
grudge against Montero's officers. Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio
Banderas), formerly one half of the infamous Murrieta brothers, is now
miserable and poor as he drinks his problems away. De La Vega stumbles
upon Alejandro when he spots a medallion he once gave to him as a young
boy for helping him in battle. Murrieta, at the time, is plotting to
kill the incomparable and cold-hearted Captain Love (Matt Letscher), who
is responsible for his brother's death. De La Vega teaches him to
control his anger, and enlists his help so that he can finally take
revenge.
And so begins the training of the new Zorro. Banderas is truly wonderful
and dashing in this role, with his inexperienced quips and humorous jabs
about getting into battle. Hopkins, on the other hand, is such a veteran
presence and distinguished actor that we will go along with whatever he
says. Together, they meld exceptionally well as the mentor and his
apprentice. This is the life-force that makes The Mask of Zorro so
enjoyable.
There's also sprinkles of romance between Banderas and the gorgeous
Zeta-Jones, played out in humorous sword-play and marvelous chemistry.
The dialogue throughout the film is crisp and well spoken, separating
the good from the bad with an easily distinguishable black line. The
human elements are fun, but the real scene-stealing belongs to the
incredible fight choreography. Characters clash their swords at
lightning speed, and Banderas flips and tumbles like an amazingly
talented daredevil acrobat. The stunts in The Mask of Zorro are all
spectacular, and the action will give you white knuckles almost
instantly.
There's a few instances of violence that could have been toned down, but
even so this should entertain the whole family. There's enough
well-played humor, rousing action and delightful romance to meet nearly
anyone's approval. The fact that Zorro has no super powers is what makes
him so unique. He fights for something that everyone can get behind,
wants what is best for his people, and has good taste in women... this
is what I call a real hero.

Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
Do the folks at Disney have no common decency? They have resurrected yet
another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive
special effects, embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick. Wasn't
Mr. Magoo enough, people?
Obviously not. Inspector Gadget is not what I would call ideal family
entertainment. Younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding
goofiness, but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping
over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in
glaring stupidity. The movie is poorly edited, grossly manipulative, and
the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle. All
the elements are there, but the manner in which director David Kellogg
pieces them together is laughable and trite.
As a huge fan of the 80's animated TV show, the first thing I must
express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain. In the
cartoon, Dr. Claw was a frightening, raspy-voiced presence who remained
a total mystery to the viewer. We never saw his face; he simply sat back
in his arm-chair, watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his
loyal cat. As a child, I always imagined what Dr. Claw would appear as -
and this curiosity kept me watching for many years. With the release of
the live-action movie, the face of this once intriguing villain has been
unrightfully exposed - it's... Rupert Everett?! Only now, Dr. Claw is
simply known as Claw (`One word,' he explains, `like Madonna'). He
sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove, and seems far less
interesting than the animated version. It helps that the dashing Everett
is enthusiastic, but he overplays the role entirely too far. When all is
said and done, this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the
screenwriters - the infamous Dr. Claw has been turned into a
wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and
cool. He does still have his cat, though.
In the title role, Matthew Broderick looks lost. The actor, while
usually downright charming, doesn't know exactly where to take his
character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers.
Broderick first plays a friendly, naive security guard named John Brown,
who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the
people. He has a mad crush on pretty scientist Brenda (Joely Fisher),
who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction
of human tissue and electronics. But one fateful night, her lab is
destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire
(Everett) who wants to take over the world. John courageously pursues
the limousine from the scene of the crime, but loses the chase when his
vehicle bursts into flames. In a full body cast, he is chosen to be the
first human prototype for Brenda's work; a revolutionary crime fighting
tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys. And so is born
Inspector Gadget.
As bad as this movie is, it does have a certain charm in isolated
scenes. Broderick actually fares better playing Robo Gadget, an evil and
destructive clone that Claw has set loose on the city. And there are
about two or three amusing punch lines, the funniest being when Robo
Gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick
wall, and a Japanese man flees the scene while screaming, `This is why I
left Tokyo!' Alas, the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in
favor of not even cracking a slight giggle. There are so many tired plot
additions. Gadget's talking car (voiced by D.L. Hughley) is the same
type of character as Zoot the suit from My Favorite Martian. Both are
wisecracking, non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller
children. Well, it just doesn't work (in fact, Zoot functioned
marvelously in comparison to this). And don't even get me started about
the villains. I didn't mind Everett's performance, but his bumbling
assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust.
The characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless
supporting roles. Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Brain the dog now
have little to do with the action, and Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) has
lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action.
The special effects are everywhere, but not so annoying they will cause
your eyes to peel over. The problem here lies solely in the script.
Perhaps the next time Disney attempts a remake like this, they will
invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals. Here is
one critic crossing his fingers, anyway.

Review for Independence Day (1996)
Fun - n. sport, amusement, jest, diversion.
While watching Independence Day, someone who's just began high school
physics may stop and say: `hey.....'. This is not an `intellectual'
disaster movie. In fact, if I had a spare $100 million dollars lying
around, I could have written and produced a similar product. But then
again, the reason one watches a movie like this is certainly not to
scout for realistic characters and sharply written dialogue. The
existence of  ID4 rides largely on the purpose of all-out explosive
entertainment, and in that field, it delivers in large quantities.
Aliens have come to Earth in large, disc-shaped spaceships that have
distributed themselves over all the major cities in the world. The
President (Bill Pullman) advises everyone to remain calm and stay within
their homes, praying that the extraterrestrial lifeforms will not become
hostile. Of course their intent is hostile. This would not be dubbed a
`disaster movie' if the aliens came down to promote peace and love. So,
much to the audience's delight, the visitors put forward a synchronized
attack that levels entire cities within a matter of minutes. It's up to
the President and a band of important survivors to find their attackers'
weaknesses and wipe them out before all is lost.
Included in this group is an array of stereotypes that you would expect.
There is Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith), an army pilot and family
man. Then there's David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), a nerdy but undeniably
bright scientist. Margaret Colin plays a White House staff advisor, Judd
Hirsch is David's Jewish pappy, and Mary McDonnell is the First Lady.
These characters' relationship bonds are merely consequential, as is the
situations in which they come together.
The special effects in ID4 are suitably impressive, however not
consistently spectacular. The destruction sequences will have you
strapped to your seat. If there is one thing that director Roland
Emmerich does truly well, it's the set-up. Everything is kept in motion,
ensuring rising suspense as we await the inevitable. Emmerich uses an
effective technique as the visitor's arrive, in which the ship's
towering shadows overtake the Lincoln Memorial, White House and other
various landmarks. In this first half-hour, we are too caught up in
anticipation to worry about the numerous technical flaws that surface.
And then, sure enough, Emmerich gives in to spectacular explosions and
air-borne attacks that will have most audience members gaping in awe.
That's not to say I didn't enjoy the second half. There is so much fun
to be had in this movie, especially for those who don't mind the idiotic
plot. It turns out that Emmerich has a few nifty surprises up his sleeve
(one including a visit to Area 51), and he injects enough gung-ho
adventure into the formula to keep us steadily entertained. The
appearance of the alien lifeforms is, while somewhat creepy, somewhat of
a disappointment.
The script often lets us down. Recycled garble involving protective
shields, uploaded viruses and even a `mother ship' appear early and
often. As long as you don't apply too much knowledge while viewing,
you're going to have a blast. The film recalls sci-fi classics from the
50's and 60's in a competent, enjoyable fashion. The cast is also solid,
even with such familiar roles. Smith and Goldblum fair okay, adding a
personal charm to their boring and obvious caricatures. Pullman is
perfect as the President, and Robert Loggia adds swift assurance to
every scene he is in. Meanwhile, Hirsch is just right, and Randy Quaid
is surprisingly strong while attempting to juggle one of the film's
biggest defects. His fate, as you'll discover early on, is entirely
predictable (but still worthwhile after all).
Don't accuse Independence Day of being moronic. Of course it is. Not
only that, it's obvious, manipulative and downright corny. But if you're
in the mood for some old-fashioned entertainment with new wave special
effects, you couldn't do much better than this exciting and fun-filled
homage.

Review for Boiler Room (2000)
Starring-Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Nia Long,
Nicky Katt, Ron Rifkin, Jamie Kennedy and Ben Affleck
Director-Ben Younger
Canadian Rating-14A
Harry (Taylor Nichols), a dedicated family man about to invest in a new
house, gets a call from a feisty stock broker one day. The broker, a new
recruit at local firm J.T. Marlin, is 19-year old college dropout Seth
Davis (Giovanni Ribisi). Seth is urging Harry to invest in a
pharmaceutical drug designed to help premature babies develop, insisting
that it will be approved within 3-months, whereupon the stock will
skyrocket. Harry, who has a relatively well-paying job in the food
business, is wary of investing on Wall Street for obvious reasons. But
Seth is a skilled graduate of Marlin's strict `back-'em-into-a-corner,
never-take-no-for-an-answer' policy of illegitimate money-making. This
environment sets the stage for `Boiler Room', an engrossing tale of
young potential millionaires who spend more time on the telephone than
your 17-year old daughter.
Seth was not always a successful junior stock broker. After pushing
aside the notion of a college degree after only one year, he is
approached by a few past acquaintances (arriving in a luxurious
Ferrari). As of now, Seth is running an illegal gambling convention out
of his own living room - with personalized chips and all. This is an
entrepreneurship that his father (Ron Rifkin), a respected judge, does
not approve of. With dreams of once getting his own Ferrari, Seth is
suckered into the business of stock brokerage. A lesser-known firm
called J.T. Marlin is searching for hot young prospects that could
evolve into junior brokers....and perhaps even further. Scenes in which
Seth is lectured on proper brokerage methods are fascinating. He is
taught to abide by the ABC rule stated in `Glengarry Glen Ross'(Always
Be Closing'), and to always be poised and ready to reel in a `whale'
(aka someone who puts complete trust in their broker and is willing to
shell out cash at their disposal). Seth grows to enjoy the job, and
makes some new friends at the office, including Chris (Vin Diesel), a
hot-shot senior broker with a very persuasive manner.
Like a junior `Wall Street', this film offers a full package of sharp,
cunning dialogue and a continually flowing plotline of absorbing
high-stakes business. But it's the human stories that make `Boiler Room'
so compelling. Seth's rough relationship with his father is rigid and
believable, as is the painful downfall of poor Harry, the first-time
client who could have made the worst financial move of his career. Above
all, `Boiler Room' is an explosive catwalk for an incredible group of
hot young stars to strut their acting abilities. Ribisi (the comic
relief in `The Mod Squad') is in top form, although the character of
Seth has its inconsistencies. Nia Long is excellent as a secretary (and
possible romantic interest) at J.T. Marlin, and Ron Rifkin (`L.A.
Confidential') adds a veteran sense of balance to his scenes. It's also
nice to see Jamie Kennedy (the beloved Randy in the `Scream' films) as a
fellow stock broker, even if the character is a drug-addicted weenie.
But the name you'll be hearing most about this week is Vin Diesel. Along
with an impressive, villainous turn in the monster movie `Pitch Black',
Diesel can now chalk up two robust screen performances in one week. Who
is this guy, you ask? Before February 2000, Diesel was hardly making a
whisper in Hollywood - he had appeared as one of the grunts in `Saving
Private Ryan' and supplied the voice of `The Iron Giant' himself.... but
that's it. Now, it appears as if Diesel is strapped in for a trip toward
stardom. The actor certainly has the agile charisma (and the imposing
physique) to do so. Although Diesel is thoroughly galvanizing, the most
electrifying 10 minutes belong to Ben Affleck, who raises the roof as a
motivational speaker who offers advice to a room full of new recruits.
The level of excitement and intensity reached in `Boiler Room' has not
been matched by another film in 2000. Debut director Ben Younger's
script is full of limber dialogue exchanges, and the momentum simply
sweeps you off your feet. There are a few big cons, as well. The rap
soundtrack gets annoying, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic and
dissatisfying, as Younger opts to leave a few questions somewhat
unanswered. But it's still one brisk, funny sequence after another. In
one priceless example, Seth is called at home by an individual trying to
sell a subscription to a local paper. Disgusted with his approach, Seth
lectures the caller on the proper way to propose a sales pitch to the
potential buyer. I'm no good at sales pitches, but I will say this: go
see `Boiler Room'. It just makes good business sense.

Title
Review for Anna and the King (1999)
`Anna and the King', the latest adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
renowned musical `The King and I', is a sumptuous and attractive epic
that manages to mask a great number of it's problems with a steady
dosage of beautiful imagery. There is impeccable detail applied to the
costuming and set designs, enough to captivate the audience over
droughts where both the pace and dramatic interest lags a bit behind.
You may be squirming in your seat periodically during this 2 hour, 30
minute epic - but luckily, two engaging stars are present to make the
experience a comfortable one.
One is Jodie Foster, who plays strong-minded British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens, a woman who makes a long and perilous journey to Siam so that
she can tutor an influential young boy. The lad is the son of King
Mongkut of Siam (Chow Yun-Fat), who rules his people with strict
standards and cultural balance. Anna conducts herself with strong will
and incredible courage for a woman in her era, confronting the King and
demanding sufficient quarters even when she's not permitted. She is
bold, to be sure, but she is also wise in more areas than the King can
imagine. Anna winds up the enter royal family (which is... large), and
lecturing them in the ways of the West with their father's approval. I
had no doubt Foster could handle the role of the brisk and strong-minded
Anna, and she does, with believable authority and appealing wisdom. I
was happy, though, to see Hong Kong action superstar Chow Yun-Fat snag
the role of the King. Despite the fact his two American thrillers (`The
Replacement Killers' and `The Corruptor') have flopped, I was optimistic
about Chow's ability to handle a major dramatic role like this. He, like
his enthusiastic counterpart, pulls through with an admirable effort.
`Anna and the King' features a screenplay that tends to be clumsy and
meandering, but mainly the film is reasonably well written. There is
light humor sprinkled about and channeled successfully through awkward
meetings between King Mongkut and Anna, and plenty of amusing material
surrounding the plot device of the King having 26 wives. How could you
not crack a few good jokes with that little bit of information? For a
steady 90 minutes, `Anna and the King' resembles just the sort of epic
story that Hollywood is famous for. The performances click, the visual
content is spellbinding, and director Andy Tennant (`Ever After')
manages to successfully engage the viewer with continuous beauty.
And then, there's a little slip-up. Tennant stretches the film to an
unnecessary 140 minutes, testing the average viewer's patience with
scenes that ring with monotony and loss of dramatic impact. If the
running length were cut short by a half-an-hour or so, then perhaps the
initially absorbing material and lavish set designs would be better
appreciated while the audience exits the theater. In it's present state,
with the film ending on a sour and empty note, some of the good
qualities are bound to be forgotten. But despite it's length, `Anna and
the King' manages to radiate enough working star power and attractive
imagery to suffice as an entertaining epic, even if it falls short of
some potential.
It's also too violent in certain areas - never extremely graphic, but
too often unsettling (especially for younger viewers). But, if there is
one thing you can't pass over with giving due notice, it's the sheer
beauty of the entire production. Expect an Oscar-nomination or two in
the categories of costuming and cinematography, but little more. Both
Foster and Yun-Fat grace the screen with their style and pizzazz, but
nothing is particularly Oscar-caliber in the performance section. Bai
Ling (`Red Corner') is strong in a small but important role as the
King's latest concubine. Ultimately, `Anna and the King' loses it's
grasp on certain possibilities for prolonging it's running length for
the wrong reasons (a war is materializing, the leads begin to grow
apart...). But it's still a nice filler, boasting solid performances and
an attractive look that will appeal to viewers of all ages. Just try to
concentrate on the good stuff, and pick a comfortable seat.

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
Director Renny Harlin hit somewhat of a rough patch in 1995, when his
pirate adventure Cutthroat Island become one of the biggest bombs of all
time. Then in 1996 came The Long Kiss Goodnight, which also
under-performed at the box office. And so, scarred by past failures and
hoping to revive his ailing career, Harlin has returned to his action
roots to deliver the underwater creature feature Deep Blue Sea.
Sharks are known for being efficient killing machines, but are never
praised for their intelligence. Deep Blue Sea gives us an excuse to
increase their IQ, introducing a group of scientists who have enlarged
the brain tissue of three mako sharks five-fold with a hope to find a
cure for Alzheimers. The experiment has commenced on Aquatica, a oceanic
research lab resembling that of a `floating Alcatraz'. Dr. Susan
McAlester (Saffron Burrows) is heading the project, along with her
assistant (Jacqueline McKenzie) and a brilliant scientist (Stellan
Skarsgard). Together, they are on the verge of a medical breakthrough.
But not everything goes to plan. There have been problems, including an
escaped mako causing havoc for a group of teenagers out on at a nightly
cruise (depicted in the distinctly Spielbergian opening scene). And
experienced shark wrangler Carter Blake (Thomas Jane) has been noticing
some surprising intellectual advances in the sharks. Namely: they can
recognize a weapon, they can swim backwards, etc. Basically, whereas a
regular mako would be thinking `Food! Food! Food!', these fishies are
deeply contemplating things like `Oh, that fellow looks somewhat chubby
for my taste... I'll have to choose another entree.'
The financial backer of the Alzheimers project, a tight-wad businessman
named Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), arrives on Aquatica to
survey the goings-on. And what timing! It is during a regular test that
everything goes awry. An arm gets gnawed off, a helicopter crashes into
the lab, all (of course) with a deadly storm brewing above. The small
group of survivors, also including the religiously fanatical chef (LL
Cool J) and the nervous engineer (Michael Rapaport), are stranded inside
with a deadly trio of toothy villains. What follows is a lot of
screaming, dismembered bodies and frantic swimming from very large
dorsal fins scanning the many hallways.
Deep Blue Sea has shadows of fun. Once we get past the familiar set-up
and the main players are introduced, we're treated to an exciting
disaster sequence involving a lot of flames and slow-motion running. The
eerie atmosphere, captured nicely throughout, sets in with a chill. But
when the reality of poor writing and cheesy special effects sets in,
this promising film becomes a perpetual disappointment. The characters
flee like extras from The Poseidon Adventure, and the script becomes so
ridiculous it often borders on self-parody.
There are a couple of moments that will make you jump - one, in
particular - but still Deep Blue Sea fails miserably as a claustrophobic
horror movie. The shark attacks are a resoundingly fake and almost
cartoonish use of computer generated imagery. The actors become rag
dolls viciously torn apart by these creatures, and the finished product
is seriously lacking in shock value. Why? Because we know, all too well,
that they are merely special effects. I only wish the excellent
animatronic sharks were relied upon more often, and these laughable
visuals could be extracted to avoid unintentional amusement.
The film's greatest asset is LL Cool J. The rapper has already tried his
hand at acting (he appeared in Halloween H2O), but his performance here
is funny and bright. Of the remaining actors, Jackson fares the best,
with his veteran authority and dignified presence adding a thankful
extra dimension. Little-known independent actor Jane could emerge a
star, while Burrows - well, her work here is superior to that of Wing
Commander. One refreshing thing about Deep Blue Sea is the fact that the
supporting cast is made up of familiar faces, and there is never a
certainty as to who is going to become dinner.
The silly script relies too much on special effects and not enough on
plot. The intelligence of the sharks is discarded in favor of the
scares, and we get little description of their super-smart antics. The
dialogue is obvious, the foundation is always creaky, and the Trevor
Rabin musical soundtrack is simply appalling. I could have concocted a
better score with kitchen utensils and tin pans. You may have fun at
Deep Blue Sea - the action is well-staged, and the pace never slows. But
you could be easily distracted by the cornball script and special
effects, which is why I advise you not to tread in these waters.

Title
Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
Starring-Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon,
Liev Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger and John Hannah
Director-Norman Jewison
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Universal Pictures - 01/00
`The Hurricane', the true story of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin
`Hurricane' Carter, is obviously a burden of love on behalf on the
filmmakers. In particular, the commendable effort of Canadian director
Norman Jewison speaks nothing but painstaking dedication. Jewison has
extracted every possible ounce of compelling drama out of Carter's
inspirational battle for justice, and channeled it into a stunningly
powerful biography. The man with center-stage, however, is Denzel
Washington.
Washington's commanding, heartfelt performance as the title character
only further justifies the fact that he could be the best actor working
in Hollywood today. His seductive puppy-dog eyes and polished speech
mannerisms entrance the viewer, and from there, the effortless nuance
and understated power of character take over. Washington's deeply
affecting portrayal of The Hurricane is just another impressive file to
add into the great performance cabinet of 1999, but there is something
that makes this one stand out. Perhaps it's because his characterization
is based upon that of an actual individual, and that Carter's story is
already compelling and touching before being formatted to a theatrical
biography. But it's Denzel who goes that extra yard to identify with the
racial injustice that Carter dealt with, and all the while remaining
loyal and true to his story. It's almost unfortunate that bits and
pieces of `The Hurricane' are too conventional, and that dramatic
authority is lacking during a few crucial moments.
The Hurricane's story begins in the boxing ring, just as Carter has
upset the favored defender and become the new Welter Weight Champion.
But there is one determined obstacle in his journey to fame: racism.
Carter is wrongly accused for a multiple-homicide by a racist police
officer (Dan Hedaya) who has hounded him since he was 11-years old. Of
course, the ruling tips in favor of his guilt, and in 1966 Carter is
sentenced to prison for the remainder of his natural life. At this
point, Jewison has more than persuaded the audience that the world is a
cruel and unjust place. But there is a faint light of hope at the end of
The Hurricane's tunnel, and that hope lies within a small group of
Canadians who would rally to set him free. Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon
Shannon), a Brooklyn youth being tutored in Toronto by three Canadian
adults, manages to find a copy of The Hurricane's autobiography, `The
Sixteenth Round'. Lesra is deeply moved by the story, and feels
compelled to meet Carter in person and somehow bring his case to a
Federal court.
`The Hurricane' is powerful stuff. Mind you, it's also a constant uphill
battle to establish some of the essential dramatic details. Jewison
crafts a beautiful story with a potent emotional backbone, only fumbling
the ball on a few childhood flashbacks, which are brief and rather
unconvincing. All of the performances are stellar. Although they are
never granted more than a peripheral outlook, Liev Schreiber, Deborah
Kara Unger and John Hannah are excellent in their roles as the
courageous Canadian trio who fight valiantly for Hurricane's freedom.
Dan Hedaya succeeds in making us want to put his character through a
meat grinder. The remainder of supporting cast includes David Paymer and
Rod Steiger, both playing small but equally pivotal roles. The
screenplay in `The Hurricane' borders on cliché too often, including an
excessive good cop-bad cop scenario, but the performances and steadfast
direction never taper off course.
Washington's performance is a great one in a semi-great movie. Another
component that is thankfully added is the believable and ultimately
heartfelt relationship between Rubin and Lesra. There is a sense of
discovery with their interaction together. It's a great feeling, just as
it must have been for the real Hurricane upon his first meeting with
this young Brooklyn lad who had identified with his novel. This
feel-good message adds fuel to the powerful fire of `The Hurricane', and
helps it overcome the conventional flaws that simmer within it's
screenplay. Of course, it all boils down to the Canadians gathering
information and connecting the dots of various witness statements to
find the proper documents for the courts to release Hurricane from
prison. Even though the finale is slightly melodramatic and easy to
anticipate, the message of `The Hurricane' radiates throughout this
inspirational biography.
`Hate put me in prison. Love's gonna bust me out'. As soon as Washington
speaks these words, we realize our journey has been worthwhile. Just as
justice does for Mr. Rubin Carter, `The Hurricane' prevails in the end.

Review for Arlington Road (1999)
It depends on your basis of judgment whether or not you will enjoy
Arlington Road, a suspenseful but convoluted Hitchockian yarn about
neighborly suspicion. Critics and audiences tend to react different to
this sort of movie, but if you are able to grasp the basic premise with
depth and believability, you should enjoy yourself.
Arlington Road was first set for release in mid-January 99, when it was
re-scheduled for a May 14 opening. But, after the violent and tragic
high school shooting in Colorado, the movie was postponed yet again to
avoid conflict that could result from it's terrorist-associated
plotline. All the more so because Arlington Road deals with violence
that takes place in a friendly environment that could resemble home for
more than a few people. It seemed nearly impossible for a film with such
a complicated past to break through in the busy season of summer.
The film does have big Hollywood names to combat the typical summer
action fare. Jeff Bridges, looking rather frigid and tense, plays
Michael Faraday, a university professor who teaches a class in U.S.
terrorism. He has a nine-year old child he's raised since the passing of
his wife, an F.B.I. agent who was killed in the line of duty. In a tense
prologue, Faraday comes upon a boy on the street, injured and bleeding
as he hobbles along helplessly. After driving him to the hospital,
Faraday meets the boy's parents, the humble and reserved Oliver Lang
(Tim Robbins) and his eccentric but caring wife (Joan Cusack). It turns
out the Lang's live just across the street from Michael, and the two
families strike a bond.
But perhaps there is more to Mr. Lang than the friendly, overly-generous
facade that he puts on. Faraday, a man so paranoid he could put Agent
Mulder to shame, suspects something more of his neighbor. He starts
digging, digs some more, and then can't stop extracting clues from
Lang's mysterious past. After discovering a name-change and scanning
through the suspect's local paper, he comes upon the conclusion that
Oliver Lang is a sophisticated terrorist bomber. His current girlfriend
(Hope Davis) thinks he's a loon, but while his son plays with the Lang's
10-year old boy who enjoys lighting firecrackers, Faraday becomes more
overwrought with fear that something is not right.
To watch Arlington Road is to appreciate good acting. Bridges is
terrific; a bit too extraneous, but terrific. And while Robbins and
Cusack are both appropriately creepy,  I wanted so much more from their
characters, more exploration resulting in greater discovery. The latter,
in particular, is left fairly one-note. And Tim Robbins has such great
abilities, his character could have been stretched far beyond the limits
it's taken. Still, there's a certain chill that runs down your back when
he tells Bridges, `I didn't know you taught a course in terrorism.
That's a pretty frightening subject.' But good for a living too, I
suppose.
Most viewers will be biting their nails to the nubs as Arlington Road
nears the climax, but the suspense could have been greater. The script,
which starts out too dreary and slow, contains so many convoluted plot
details that a sense of unease sets in. Luckily, the action picks up and
the suspense goes into overdrive during the final twenty minutes,
leaving room for a very surprising and deviously clever finale. Some may
find it unnecessary, but I actually found more to like in it than I did
with the twisted 2 hours that preceded it. If Arlington Road had
maintained a steady intellectual pace to support this climax, than
perhaps there would have been more to relish in this entertaining but
passable summer popcorn movie.
Footnote: A good invitation for a neighborhood barbecue hosted by
Robbins' character would read: `BYOB: Bring Your Own Bomb'. Ha, ha.

Review for Mummy, The (1999)
Starring-Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo
Director-Stephen Sommers
Rated 14A
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:   http://welcome.to/movieviews
What do you get when you combine old fashioned Indiana Jones-style
adventure with modernized special effects? Well, the result would look
something like The Mummy.
Sort of.
For hidden behind all the action, gun-fire and spiritual malarkey you'd
expect lies a very goofy foundation. As the opening scene suggests, this
remake often relies on self-parody and comic timing just as much as it
does with it's adventurous tone.
The movie begins in ancient Egypt, where a Priest named Imhotep (Arnold
Vosloo) is fooling around with the Pharaoh's daughter. The grisly
consequences entail that Imhotep be wrapped in bandages and incarcerated
for eternity in his tight-fitting sarcophagus. He is buried with a
terrible curse: anyone who wakes him will suffer the 10 Plagues of
Egypt, and will be used as spare parts for reanimation purposes.
Sure enough, in 1920, two expedition teams have set out to find the
treasure at Humunaptra (the legendary `City of the Dead'). One is led by
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), a rag-tag legion soldier who knows how
to handle himself. Accompanying him is a hieroglyphics-reading librarian
(Rachel Weisz) and her smart-mouth brother (John Hannah).
Then, of course, they awake the title character. Soon enough,
flesh-eating scarab-beetles, pesky locusts and walking corpses are after
them, and Imhotep is out to reconstruct himself and resurrect his
mummified bride. The special effects in The Mummy are not seamlessly
blended into the atmosphere, but they are rather excellent; the `wall of
sand' effect towards the finale is particularly effective. Fraser looks
surprisingly suited to this newfound role, and watching his form strikes
just the right balance in this ridiculously enjoyable
adventure/comedy/romance/horror- yes, it's complete funhouse of a movie.
Director Stephen Sommers is much better when it comes to adventure (The
Jungle Book) than horror (Deep Rising), which is why I am glad he put
such a unique spin on this classic remake. The jokes fly fast and
furious, mostly derived from Hannah's spirited performance and the
presence of Kevin J. O'Connor as the leader of the second expedition.
I'm embarrassed to say it, but I did laugh more than once. Okay, several
times. Even so, the consistent, familiar punchlines grow seriously old
as the movie progresses.
The Mummy is just stupid fun, no more. Fraser has battles with the
bandaged monsters, slicing off limbs with a delightful goofiness that
seems closely akin to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movies. If you want a
blockbuster full of thrills and chills, this is not the movie to see.
The Mummy is silly, stereotypical, but above all, it's totally
enjoyable.

Title
Review for Stuart Little (1999)
It's phenomenal how much F/X work has been dedicated to making the title
character of `Stuart Little' a realistic screen presence. Stuart, an
orphaned mouse with an entire wardrobe of CGI clothing, is so convincing
as a walking, talking entity that we tend to forget he's merely an
elaborate special effect. `Stuart Little' is one for the kids, but at a
time like Christmas, it will easily function as agreeable entertainment
for the entire family.
Heading into the Christmas holidays, there are two family features
opening at your local cinema: this live action adaptation of E.B.
White's cherished children's novel, and the Robin Williams android
comedy `Bicentennial Man'. While `Bicentennial Man' offers some thought,
this charming tale has more of the proper ingredients to serve as a
crowd-pleaser for all ages. With director Rob Minkoff (`The Lion King')
behind the wheel, `Stuart Little' is chock-full of talking rodents and
frantic felines, all weaving their way through cute situations that the
kids will be enthralled by. But there is fun for the adult group, too,
in spotting the voice talents of various Hollywood stars. Listen for
Nathan Lane, Steve Zahn, Chazz Palminteri, Jennifer Tilly, and Michael
J. Fox as the little man himself.
Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) have decided to
adopt a younger child into their family. The sight of the undisciplined
hooligans running around and screaming at the orphanage, however, brings
them to an alternate decision: they will adopt a mouse instead. Stuart
is excited to become part of the Little family, but their son George
(Johathan Lipnicki) has trouble accepting a mouse as a younger brother.
This problem is fairly understandable. Meanwhile, Stuart must ward off
the vile and villainous kitty Snowbell (voice of Nathan Lane), who seems
intent on getting rid of the little fella before the next family photo.
For the most part, the human actors play second fiddle to the animal
characters. But I found this move acceptable, particularly given the
performance of Lane, who is wonderfully vibrant as the demure but
dastardly Snowbell.
Michael J. Fox is perfect for the bashful suitings of Stuart, deriving
certain emotions out of the character to a degree that few other actors
could match. The special effects work for the talking cats (which
resembles the F/X from `Babe') is seamless and enjoyable, but the
spotlight here is definitely on the awe-inspiring creation of Stuart
Little himself. The wonderful visual effects go behind the call of duty
with convincing the audience that Stuart is actually just a miniature
actor. The blending of computer animation and live action is
consistently excellent, particularly in a miraculous boat race sequence
that is executed in perfect perspective. And Stuart has his own little
car, of course. Like I say, this is one for the kids.
Not that adults can't laugh along too. The screenplay is, oddly enough,
co-written none other than M. Night Shyamalan - the brilliant mind
behind the huge blockbuster hit `The Sixth Sense'. The story Stuart is
pitted into is nothing special, but there are some clever nuggets of
humor for the parental units as well. I hate to admit it, but I have
never read the novel `Stuart Little', despite it's obvious favor among
the Grade 2 crowd. I know, shame on me. I can see the possibility of
certain fans of the book being disappointed with the film, which
contains a glowing heart but really never elevates itself past the
elementary level of cute talking animals. Nonetheless, kids of all ages
are bound to be taken by the charming story of `Stuart Little', and it's
harmless nature is almost guaranteed to please adults as well.
And that is why I commend this family outing. There is nothing
spectacular about the way it is structured, but `Stuart Little' is
succeeds on the level of innocent entertainment. It's the cream of the
Holiday crop, with a title character who is easily the most welcome
special effect of the entire year.

Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
The idea of a teenage comedy set in a high school has been used
extensively over the past few years. It seems we're also seeing a
pattern in the plot of these movies: a guy or girl is masquerading as
something they are not, they fall in love in the process, and then their
girlfriend or boyfriend finds out about the scheme they are pulling. It
happened in She's All That, it happened in 10 Things I Hate About You,
and now budging in line is Never Been Kissed.
Here, Drew Barrymore plays Josie Gellar, a young reporter for the
Chicago Sun Times. She's given the breakthrough opportunity of her
career: an undercover story about the lifestyle of today's teenagers.
This means that Josie must disguise herself as a 17-year old and go
behind enemy lines at a local high school to get the scoop. She must
elude the school geek (Leelee Sobieski) and become chums with the `in'
girls without hurting anyone's feelings. Ah, to be young again...
Barrymore has come a long way since her turbulent childhood, and has
proven herself to be a great young actress. Even as the film becomes
increasingly hard to swallow, Barrymore has the ability to sweep us off
our feet at any given time. I hardly believed a moment in Never Been
Kissed, but the film and it's stars are so unexpectedly charming and
sweet you will have to fight off the urge to smile.
There is one aspect of the story that is quite different. The main
character here has two alternatives for love. There's her kind English
teacher (Michael Vartan) or a hunky classmate (Jeremy Jordan) who both
have their respective eyes on Josie. Director Raja Gosnell decides to
take the easy route, tying up the loose ends in an unsurprising manner,
but the film's genuine charm still manages to catch you off guard during
the final scenes.
This also leaves room for a few key supporting players to shine. David
Arquette plays Josie's once popular brother, in a funny performance that
rings nicely true. John C. Reilly is her editor, and Garry Marshall
plays the big boss of the paper. The screenplay is about as lumpy as a
disastrous Thanksgiving gravy, but that's the least of your worries.
When you actually stop to think about the movie's plot, you may realize
how completely ludicrous it sounds. Never Been Kissed even ends with the
ultimate teen movie cliché: the Prom. How in the world the film develops
into a sheer delight I may never know, but the probable reason is the
young executive-producer and star. These are high times for Drew
Barrymore, and here she displays the charisma and magnetism that all
great Hollywood actresses possess. I hope the world is ready for Drew,
because she's making her move in high style.

Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
In Double Jeopardy, the stakes are high. Think of the plot as a rehash
of Sleeping With the Enemy, and then rearrange the details and the
gender of the stalker. The finished product, although able to maintain
the viewer's attention, is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an
idiotic script. `Alex, I'll take Homicide for $400...'
Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) is a happily married mom leading a normal
life. One night, her husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) takes her out for a
romantic escape on a sailboat. Libby awakens in the middle of the night
to find she is covered in blood and Nick has strangely disappeared. She
follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck, where she handles a
fallen knife (like any stupid character) and is spotted by the Coast
Guard, who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the
evening. Nick is presumed dead, and although she pleads her innocence,
Libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband.
Now, please don't think I'm spoiling any vital plot details, because the
informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans. If you
haven't seen this preview, don't read any further. But seriously, the
inane screenplay by Douglas Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook is so
elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of
the characters. During the most vital scenes in the movie, I was
anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the
screen. I imagine the writers presume their core audience for Double
Jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals. Most, unfortunately, will
be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive
aspects of the production.
One is Tommy Lee Jones, who plays Travis Lehman, a parole officer given
the tedious task of watching over Libby after she serves her sentence in
prison. Jones is always wonderful as an authority figure, and he's
certainly familiar with this sort of role (as he played so well in The
Fugitive and US Marshals). Judd, as a likable heroin with gusto, also
has a chance to flex her acting abilities. While emotionally
unconvincing, the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role,
perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant. The actors,
and their relationship together, present the one-two punch that prevents
Double Jeopardy from derailing itself entirely.
And now, back to the plot. While behind bars, Libby learns an
interesting little bit of information: a person can't be convicted of
the same crime twice. This law, called `double jeopardy', could be her
motive for hunting down her husband... who may still be alive. Yes, you
heard right. The movie degenerates into a cross-country chase, where
everything you expect to happen... does. The final scenes, which could
have redeemed the film, are poorly handled by director Bruce Beresford -
whose previous work centers highly around drama (Driving Miss Daisy,
Paradise Road). Ironically, it is those elements - like the driving
force of Libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here.
At least Double Jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of
the two stars. Unfortunately, Jones lacks some of the edge that he had
as Sam Gerard in The Fugitive, and the real depth of his character is
only skin deep. But he and Ashley Judd are more than welcome considering
the material, and both have some memorable comic moments. Judd, in
particular, has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming
male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer'.
Hmmm... perhaps this would have made a good comedy.
It is disappointing, because there are the makings of a competent action
film here. It's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown Vancouver, and
will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line.
Tis a shame that Double Jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't
fool most children.

Review for Scream (1996)
WARNING: THE FOLLOWING COMMENTARY MAY REVEAL SPOILERS FROM THE "SCREAM"
FILMS, PRIMARILY "SCREAM 3". IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM AND WISH TO DO
SO WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLOT, AND BY SOME MIRACLE OF NATURE YOUR
HIGH SCHOOL CRONIES HAVEN'T SPILLED ALL THE BEANS, THEN PROCEED WITH
CAUTION.
Well, here I am. It's been several days since my `Scream 3' experience,
and I'm still wearing a gratified smirk across my face. Now, this
particular smirk is not merely due to the fact I thought the film was a
riot. It has to do with closure....the final lace being neatly tied in
the phenomenal horror series that made slasher films fun again. And
perhaps more fun than ever before.
I've seen `Scream 3' twice. The cutting edge wit of Kevin Williamson's
caustic pen may be absent, but worthy successor Ehren Kruger finishes
the series on a positive note of great fulfillment. I willingly concede
that `Scream 3' is the sloppiest of the trilogy, with a generic serial
killer plot-line that occasionally emits the pungent stench of a good
formula gone sour. But it's still fun. Watching Williamson's characters
evolve with such prudent care is a treat for all fans of the series.
Now, when did the smirk materialize across my face exactly? It was the
final shot of the movie, which performs a miracle of closure. Never mind
the obtrusive plot holes that were scattered throughout the film earlier
(namely with the unmasking of the killer)... this is a brilliantly
effective way for Kruger to conclude the movie and the trilogy. Kevin
Williamson would concur.
Which is why I ask Miramax to end it here. Let `Scream' rest in peace
and maintain the amount of dignity warranted by a proper burial like
this. After the biggest opening weekend of the series - an estimated
$34.7 million in box office ticket sales - the idea of a `Scream 4'
could have perhaps crossed the mind of certain executives at Miramax. I
shudder to think of the possible resurrection of the series after such a
commendable finale. With that frightening piece of information in mind,
I offer the following tribute to the `Scream' franchise, which shattered
the rules of conventional horror in more ways than one. Just think.... a
slasher series with actual character development, that didn't take its
core audience for merely a pack of adolescent idiots who were stupid
enough to shell out the cash. I love the whole `Scream' universe, and
with this memorial, I'd just like to get a few things off my shoulder
and say adios for the last time.
Yeah, I know. It's just a stupid movie. But while watching the `Scream'
movies, I get that nostalgic feeling of blissful glee knowing that this
is the highest form of barbed wit and palatable ingenuity that the genre
will ever see. The `Scream' films (or at least the first two) are among
my favorites, despite the fact I didn't award either with my highest
rating. Keep in mind, dear readers, that favorite' doesn't necessarily
go alongside best'.
I rewatch them with the same amount of jubilant excitement and discovery
every time, acknowledging that there are enough pop culture references
and wink-wink in-jokes to even satisfy those who despise slasher films
with a passion. Take one scene in `Scream 2', where a pair of dim-witted
sorority sisters (Portia De Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart) explain that the
hoopla surrounding the movie `Stab' is only related to our heroine
Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in a `six degrees of Kevin Bacon sort of
way'. Or in the original `Scream', when tanktop-lovin' Tatum (Rose
McGowan) notes that the murders in their small town of Woodsboro are
beginning to sound like `something out a Wes Carpenter flick'. Just for
the record, that's a combination of horror pioneer and `Scream' director
Wes Craven and another legendary gore-meister by the name of John
Carpenter. And then, there's `The Rules'. You don't know The Rules?
According to obsessively paranoid film geek Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy),
there are certain rules one must abide by to successfully survive a
horror movie.....
1) You can never have sex.
2) You can never drink or do drugs.
3) Never, ever, under any circumstances, say `I'll be right back'.
Randy is obviously knowledgeable on the topic of the endlessly recycled
teen slasher genre. With `Prom Night', `Sleepaway Camp', and the
seemingly infinite `Friday the 13th' franchise, one could identity a
popular cinematic trend throughout the 1980's. Hmmm...if someone were to
lampoon this trend in a sly parody of modern horror, the result would be
amusing. Right? It took until 1996 for rookie screenwriter Kevin
Williamson to do so. With `Scream', the horror genre was revitalized
into a hip new slice of bloody pop culture where movie references
abound. It was a rarity that promised the audience an ample quota of
scares and laughs... and delivered. But, when you get right down to it,
the `Scream' films are about murder. They're merely customary slasher
films, elevated substantially by a self-mocking manner that is sharp,
witty and refreshing. Which brings me to....
1) Drew Barrymore in `Scream'. This positively blood-chilling opening
sequence will be what the series is remembered by; the trademark moments
when the intensity and cunning brilliance of the screenplay and
direction reach peak form. Casey Becker (Barrymore), home alone to watch
a scary movie and make Jiffy Pop, receives a call from a pestering
gravely voice. He calls again, and again.... until it becomes evident
that he is outside her home with the strict intent of gutting her like a
fish before the night is through. After she answers a trivia question
(category: horror villains) incorrectly, she watches in petrified horror
as her boyfriend's intestinal tract spills out onto her patio. What is
arguably the most horrific sequence in the trilogy ends with an image
that strikes down the viewer with morbid dread: Casey's bloody body,
dangling from a tree, is discovered by her parents. Not surprising, the
remainder of the film is unable to recapture the type of merciless,
apprehensive terror as seen with Casey Becker's untimely demise.
2) Jamie Kennedy in `Scream 2'. Kevin Williamson risked creating a mob
of angry, devastated fans with this shocking (and particularly ballsy)
move. Fan favorite Randy Meeks, with cellular phone in hand, carries on
a crackling conversation on a college campus park with the killer.
During this time, Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox
Arquette) madly dash to scout the possible caller, tackling students
with cell-phones to the ground. Unfortunately, Randy gets grabbed from
behind and hauled into a news van, where he is repeatedly stabbed to
death.
The park scene represents some of Williamson's sharpest writing, but
director Wes Craven is the real craftsman to mention, fashioning an
eerie atmosphere in a scene set in broad daylight - not an easy thing to
do. An incredibly effective crane shot, revealing that Randy is the only
person in the vicinity, shifts the tone from edgy humor (produced by the
quirky phone conversation) to claustrophobic suspense perfectly. And
after the deed is done, the sight of viscous blood seeping through the
crack under the van door (not to mention Gale's horrified reaction) just
leaves you cold and shivering.  A worthy farewell to a great character.
3) Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps in `Scream 2'. It's your worst nightmare:
a movie theater packed with drooling, raving fanatics in ghostface
costumes, clutching plastic knives everywhere you turn. This is the
environment when Maureen (Pinkett) and Phil (Epps) enter a sneak preview
of `Stab', the movie-within-a-movie based on the slayings in `Scream'.
After discussing the politics of African-American driven films (or lack
thereof), they enter, despite the fact that Maureen is opting for the
Sandra Bullock flick down the street. Should've gone with Sandra,
because `Hope Floats' is still better than getting gorily diced any day
of the week.
In a nutshell: Phil goes to washroom, gets stabbed through the stall
door. The masked murderer travels back to the theater and sits next to
Maureen, donning Phil's jacket. Maureen is slashed repeatedly, as the
movie-going onlookers watch the murder transpire, thinking it's some
publicity stunt for the film. Talk about setting the mood... this
opening sequence is creepy and unsettling. You'll be squirming in your
seat, but at least the events in `Stab' are amusing: Heather Graham,
playing Drew Barrymore's character from the original, reenacts the
famous opening murder with a classic lampoon of farcical glee.
Honorable Mentions:
-Tatum has garage door problems in `Scream'.
-Tom (Matt Keeslar) `smells the gas' in `Scream 3'.
An unexpected backlash arose with the release of `Scream 3': certain
people suddenly started bagging on `Scream 2'. Let me clear this up.
In my opinion, `Scream 2' could possibly be the best of the trilogy. It
offers more thrills than the original, the humor is fresh and equally
amusing, and the characters develop with devoted compassion. I guess
what the majority of viewers are irritated with is the finale, when the
whodunit is revealed. Where the original was a somber and serious
climactic revelation, this one is more like a `Scooby Doo' adventure. Oh
no, Shaggy! It's not bothersome reporter Debbie Salt at all... it's
actually Mrs. Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), Billy's mother returning for her
vengeance! Ok, it is a little goofy. But, even though it stands as the
weakest link of the film, it's still decent enough. And good ol' Kevin
Williamson keeps the wit vibrating throughout the entire series of
complications, as when the `freaky Tarantino film student' Mickey
(Timothy Olyphant), the other murderous half behind the ghostface mask,
battles a surprisingly resilient Sidney on a theater stage. `Sid, you
got a Linda Hamilton thing going,' Mickey says as the scale finally tips
in his favor.
The conclusion is only so-so, but I think people forget what an
efficient horror masterpiece Williamson and Craven had crafted before
the stupidity factor kicked in.
Financially, `Scream 2' was just as successful as its predecessor.
Critically, it fared even better than the decidedly mixed reception that
`Scream' received upon its original release (don't argue with me -
that's a fact). While `Scream 2' is one of the best sequels I've ever
seen, `Scream 3' is simply a fun but totally generic slasher movie.
Anyone who favors the third over the second has forgotten what the
`Scream' movies were about to begin with.
Dwight `Dewey' Riley began as a simple-minded Deputy in the small town
of Woodsboro. Unfortunately, during a courageous sweep of a bloody crime
scene, he was stabbed in the back. Dewey returned, albeit with a limp
from severed nerve damage, to protect his friends from further possible
danger on a college campus. Unfortunately, he was stabbed in the
back.... many, many times. But Dewey pulled through. Now unable to
continue with his law-enforcing duties, Dewey applied his knowledge to
the job of technical consultant on a film set. Again, Dewey showed
commendable bravery in battling another evil, costumed psycho who wanted
to mutilate his dear friends.
Kudos to David Arquette for, three times over, playing such a likable
character so well. It only occurred to me how much I love the doofus
when, during a few near-death scenarios in `Scream 3', I let out a
piercing howl of `LOOK OUT, DEWEY!!!!' ....well, not really. But Dewey
is still the most charming, lovable personality in the `Scream'
universe. When he walks into a room, the mood suddenly becomes light and
enjoyable. How many different ways can I say it? The guy is awesome. So
Dewey, take care, and know that you will always have a welcome
place..... in our VCR.
I don't like to single anybody out. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox
Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber... in your returning roles, you
were (*sniff*) inspirational. And everyone else - Skeet Ulrich, Matthew
Lillard, Elise Neal, Jerry O'Connell, Duane Martin, Parker Posey, Jenny
McCarthy and associates - I appreciate your help as well. `Scream', you
shall be remembered in a positive light. R.I.P., good buddy.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
For More "MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton"
Visit:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
The Blair Witch Project, a low-budget horror movie that scared audiences
silly at the Sundance Film Festival, has been receiving incredible
acclaim among moviegoers. Certain critics have dubbed it `the scariest
movie since The Exorcist'. I'll be honest with you: it ain't. But what
director tag-team Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have achieved here
is nothing short of extraordinary: opening the imagination to a world of
frightening possibilities. Tell yourself calmly `It isn't real' before
you enter the theater, and all should go smoothly.
The Blair Witch is a mythical creature said to live in the backwoods of
a small town called Burkitsville, Maryland. There have been many
campfire stories told about the murders of children and other
frightening occurrences, but no solid proof that the witch in question
ever existed. Three young college students - Heather (Heather Donahue),
Mikey (Michael Williams) and Josh (Joshua Leonard) - have set out to
make a documentary of the Blair Witch. Food and supplies have been
packed for a 2 or 3 day venture into the woods, where they hope to find
historical landmarks that have a significance in their project. They
interview the locals and find it to be common knowledge. However,
neither three show any particular respect toward the legend; they merely
view it as a fun trip into the woods and a chance to get very drunk.
The entire 90-minutes of The Blair Witch Project is composed of choppy
footage that, we are told, was found one year later. There are two
cameras that the trio use: a full color hand-held camcorder operated by
Heather to record the documentary in process, and a larger one used by
Josh for real footage. Mikey, meanwhile, is the sound man.
Sanchez and Myrick have made this film as real as humanly possible. The
actors use their actual names, and the shoot was supposedly composed
largely of improvisation, brought on by fear of the dark woods. When
things become scary for the characters, the tension begins to build in
the audience. They find themselves lost in the woods, stumbling upon
frightening crosses and stick figures dangling from the trees. Some
monologues are carried on in a pitch black setting taking place in the
tent, and you can only imagine what's going on around them. Things
become creepier than creepy when the group begins to hear children's
voices, and other mysterious sounds, echoing through the woods in the
night. We're very thankful when daylight hits.
As spooky as all of this sounds, it is much scarier in the aftermath.
You will go over certain scenes in your mind - in fact, one character's
helpless screams are still repeating themselves in my head. The
performances are air-tight, especially by Williams and Leonard.
Occasionally, Heather Donahue's cries and outbursts of profanity seem
forced. But, she also owns the most effective scene in the movie, in
which she records her apologies to the group's parents while holding
back sobs of terror. `I'm too scared to close my eyes, and I'm too
scared to open them,' she explains.
Sanchez and Myrick have wrung this great premise for every ounce of
possible fear. It is not so horrific that you'll find yourself quivering
in your seat, but it is scary. The ending contains one of the most
frightening frames in movie history. And, with only one scene of brief
violence, the directors have largely succeeded in proving one fact: that
images the imagination can conjure up are far more frightening than
anything shown on film. The Blair Witch Project is no phenomenon, but it
is very, very well done.

Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
`Run Lola Run', a German import that gained a stellar reputation at the
Sundance Film Festival, is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with
the subjects of fate and chance. For a berserk and retroactive 81
minutes of non-stop movement, we follow a fiery-haired heroine named
Lola (Franka Potente) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the
clutches of drug dealers. Lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow
retrieve 100,000 marks in time to save Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) from
being killed by the dealer. But, in something of a pseudo- `Groundhog
Day' approach, director Tom Tykwer gives Lola three separate chances to
best navigate her way toward the goal. In these trio of episodes, we
gradually learn the unique effects of fate, for even if tiny changes are
made in Lola's journey, the future can be seriously altered.
`Run Lola Run' is an experience like `Fight Club' or `The Matrix', in
that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending
reality in surreal and exciting ways. In addition, all three movies have
a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack. `Lola' is
no exception, with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography
that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go. Tykwer's world
is a landscape of mood and color, with brilliant shades of red and pink
(including Lola's fiery hair) used as effective symbolism throughout.
With it's visual style and mind-blowing pace, `Run Lola Run' is one of
the more invigorating movies of the year. Even more so when considering
the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time
period.
As a heroine, Potente does little more than run wildly through the
streets (as the title suggests), but she has a certain flair and
charisma. Her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a
track star. Meanwhile, Bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of
bringing the dopey but passionate Manni to life. Both actors perform
beyond the call of duty. The dazzling fun comes from predicting what
each episode holds in store for Lola, and the outcome is ultimately
rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected. The
other characters Lola runs into (both purposely and inadvertently)
include her banker father (Herbert Kraup) and a friendly security guard
(Armin Rohde), but aside from the two leads, no one has more than a few
minutes of screen time. Additional stars that couldn't possibly be
ignored are cinematographer Frank Griebe and editor Mathilde Bonnefroy,
who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance.
`Run Lola Run' is subtitled, so be prepared to meet the challenge of
reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are
especially fast. This is only one of the minor chores involved in
watching. The other is the sense that we never get to really recognize
who the real people are in this hyperactive situation. Most are just
chess pieces in Tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation, and he
never really makes a significant move with any. But, the average viewer
is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack
of potency in a few elements of the screenplay. A few petty gripes
aside, this film is a wild, exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on
its wheel of originality.
Most people believe foreign films are mainly boring, talky character
studies. Perhaps `Run Lola Run' will recharge their batteries. Not only
does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and
destiny, it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of
overwhelming audacity. Like how the experience must have been for the
persistent title character, `Run Lola Run' is exhausting.

Title
Review for Baby Geniuses (1999)
An experience like Baby Geniuses can have certain effects on an average
moviegoer. You may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece
of garbage, which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to
ponder it's Hollywood existence.
When I think of the screenwriters behind this film, I picture a room
full of monkeys. The monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while
scratching themselves. All of the monkeys combine their efforts, hop in
a cab and take the finished product downtown to director Bob Clark's
office. The designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down
on Clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking. The director
appears to be deep in thought, until he slams his fist down on the
desktop and exclaims `I LOVE IT!!!'
The writing behind this project is embarrassing. For your amusement, I
will explain the plot. Dr. Kinder (Kathleen Turner) and Dr. Heep
(Christopher Lloyd) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the Baby
Geniuses Institute, where peculiar studies are going on. As the story
goes, there is an ancient myth explaining that babies (ages 2 and under)
know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences. When
they move past this phase, they become like any other drooling toddler.
Kinder and Heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies,
namely little Sylvester (Sly for short), who can break in or out of any
given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the
Mission: Impossible team. There is so much crap derived from this
premise, despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in Look
Who's Talking! (a far superior film in any league).
You will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the
opening scene. Sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several
security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics.
Question: it's obvious the babies are super-smart, but why are they able
to fight like Jackie Chan?? The adults in this film are furiously beaten
by these youngsters in diapers. It's a shock when writers will stoop
this low just to draw cheap laughs by using John Hughes' familiar Home
Alone formula. I also found it disturbing that the babies in this film
have attitude and endless 90's knowledge, quoting numerous movies and
insulting their adult captors. The effects in Baby Geniuses (similar to
the talking animals in Babe) are pathetic, the editing is a disaster,
and the jokes are never funny. The only reason viewers may avoid
vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute'.
I suppose they are. I can admit to smiling a few times because the
babies were cute. Other instances, though, I was howling in laughter due
to the inane stupidity of the script. There are supporting characters
who have no personality whatsoever; their entire existence is based on
punch lines. Peter MacNicol and Kim Cattrall, as an unwilling couple who
have adopted Sylvester's twin, are both miscast. Then again, I don't
suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking
incredibly stupid. Meanwhile, Dom Deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in
the crotch with a monkey wrench (hahaha).
I would avoid Baby Geniuses at all costs. Instead of watching this, I
would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling.
Or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters.
Anything to avoid this painful movie. The final line in the film, spoken
by the bratty Sylvester, is `If they think I'm doing the sequel for less
than $20 mill, they're nuts'. Sequel?  Please have mercy.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
In Notting Hill, Julia Roberts plays an internationally renowned movie
star named Anna Scott, who is in such demand that her last project
carried a paycheck of 15 million dollars. If there ever was a
wonderful role for Roberts, this is it - as she, a famous actress,
portrays one just as famous on screen. This character showcases all
the positive shades of her acting abilities, but even as her
performance sparkles in every scene, there is still much more to
relish in this delightfully charming movie.
I am no big fan of the romance genre, save for the occasional teaming
of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. I sometimes have difficulty sitting through
a film where nothing gets blown up. Notting Hill, however, is
something special. It relies on chemistry to carry itself until the
credits start to roll, and noting that the chemistry in the movie is
genuinely believable, it has no trouble achieving success.
The title location is a small, friendly community in the city of
London, where a shy and reserved book store owner named William
Thacker (Hugh Grant) sells Travel guides. One day, Anna Scott herself
trounces in the door, much to his amazement and surprise. She buys a
book about Turkey, smiles innocently, and leaves the store.
But surely they will meet again. In this case, William collides with
Anna walking down the street, staining her shirt with orange
juice. Despite the amazing awkwardness of the situation, they begin to
fall in love. From here, Notting Hill becomes a clash of two separate
worlds: William's quaint, boring day-by-day life versus Anna's
busy, media hounded schedule. Scenes where "normal" people, such
as William's friends and family interact with the enormous movie
star are both hilariously truthful and fun to watch.
The script, by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral), is like a
breath of fresh air. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the characters
are interesting, and not a minute of the romance feels
artificial. William' s apartment flatmate, Spike (Rhys Ifans),
provides a few roars of laughter, but doesn't steal too much of the
star's important screen time.
This is Roberts' best film vehicle in some time, but don't
overlook Grant's modest, charming performance. He fits the role and
all of it's demands perfectly. Scenes involving his tendency to say
"whoopsidaisy" and going over Anna's lines from her upcoming
film, generate just the precise amount of sparks.
Notting Hill is unique, adorable and insightful. All of which, suffice
to say, adds up to one of the most enjoyable romances since Sleepless
in Seattle.

Review for Final Destination (2000)
Starring-Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Kristin Cloke,
Chad E. Donnella, Seann William Scott and Amanda Detmer
Director-James Wong
Canadian Rating-18A
Released by New Line Cinema - 03/00
The premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `Final Destination'
causes a recollection of a memorable `Simpsons' Halloween episode. After
attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster, lovably ignorant
patriarch Homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine. After a
trek into the Cretaceous period, Homer observes that any minor
alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and
seriously modify the present world. Again and again, Homer toys with the
master plan and pays dearly for it. The characters of `Final
Destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their
existence - their `design'. Someone is after them with the strict intent
of correcting the mistake. That someone is Death.
You see, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and six others have cheated the Grim
Reaper.... but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve. For a high
school excursion, Alex's French class is traveling to Paris by airline
transport. Alex, tense and neurotic, has a shocking premonition after
boarding: he sees the plane, and every passenger on it, spontaneously
explode in mid-air. In a panic of sheer lunacy, Alex charges his way
through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft. After a handful
of others (including one teacher) follow and are denied admittance back
onto the plane, the unwitting survivors' watch in horror as the plane
actually explodes in the drizzling night sky. The loony vision Alex
experiences does actually materialize.  But Death won't be cheated so
easily, and one by one, the survivors of Flight 180 are offed in
mysteriously gruesome circumstances. The grisly murder count baffles the
local officials and FBI. Before I delve into the meat of the review, I'd
just like to confer.... is that one helluva premise, or what?
`Final Destination', creepy beyond rational comprehension, probably
reads more like an unsettling `X-Files' episode than `The Simpsons' -
therefore, the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators
behind both are Glen Morgan and James Wong. On familiar turf, the task
of establishing footing is not difficult for Morgan and Wong, and the
opening 20 minutes of `Final Destination' reflects that. Unlike most
thrillers, the set-up is crisp and cool. You just deeply, sincerely hope
that the momentum won't unspool, leaving us with a second-string effort
with nothing but cheap, derivative shocks. Young viewers have a palpable
reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration, what with `I Know
What You Did Last Summer' and sequel, `Idle Hands' and -- a movie with a
nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `Urban Legend'. After
the set-up, when I remained slouched apprehensively in my chair, I
started to really have fun with `Final Destination'. Low and behold, a
teen thriller that is actually unsettling, actually suspenseful and --
yes -- actually intelligent. Some splotty logic and a heap of
characteristic genre flaws aside, this film is among the most refreshing
and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge
`Scream' in 1996. `Final Destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a
exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher
crap we've endured throughout the past few years.
Not that the characters are that good. Sawa is game as Alex, a
connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend. In
addition, the survivors are endearing geek Tod (Chad E. Donella), jocky
control-freak Carter (Kerr Smith of `Dawson's Creek'), Carter's ditzy
girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), the none-too-subtly named Billy
Hitchcock (Seann William Scott, supplier of lukewarm comic relief) and a
lone teacher - the emotionally delicate Ms. Lewton (Kristin Cloke).
Aside from Alex, the primary center of interest is intended to be Ali
Larter (`Varsity Blues'), playing an abstract character named Clear
Rivers (what were her parents thinking?!?). The personality of Clear is
written with such a vague, nebulous definition that she resembles a
walking flash-card saying `Hello, I am the offbeat character designed to
identify with the main character's plight!' Toss a few stereotypical FBI
agents (Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith) and a....ummm...
`spiritual' mortician (former `Candyman' Tony Todd) into the mix, and
you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing,
dicing and assorted disembowelments.
Not so. `Final Destination' has no slicing and dicing, or at least none
dealt by a human killer, and the thought of Death itself as the unseen
stalker is unique and frightening. The extra dimension of disconcerting
irony rejuvenates the decaying murderer-on-the-loose' concept, with
assistance from a shrewd, intelligently paced screenplay by Morgan, Wong
and Jeffrey Reddick. The plot twists are fun and clever without toppling
into utter absurdity (listen up, `Reindeer Games'). But I suppose the
most satisfying aspect of `Final Destination' is the murder scenes.
Creative, resourceful and breathlessly inventive, the death sequences
involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise.
What will trigger the accident? Will it be the John Denver record, just
put on to play `Rocky Mountain High'? (yeah, sick humor). Will it be the
leaking toilet? The falling fishing reel in the corner? The murders are
startling and largely unforeseen, including one surprise incident that
made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for
roughly a minute afterward. A sense of giddy unpredictability is added
with this inventive approach. It gets sorta tasteless and cheap
sometimes, but who cares? It's fun.
In that simple regard, `Final Destination' is my cup of tea. This
stylishly executed thriller, although tagged with laughable
circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue, is an
immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side. After the show, it will
also have an frightening impact on you. When will your design' expire?
Is Death waiting around the corner? The `Final' effect is a major case
of the heebie-jeebies.

Title
Review for Anywhere But Here (1999)
Is there a lot brewing within `Anywhere but Here', or does it just seem
that way? There is little depth or inner context to this story of a
feuding mother and daughter, but the actors submit a tremendous amount
of heart and realism. In turn, the emotional impact is multiplied. And
if you don't get misty-eyed during `Anywhere but Here', I'm afraid your
retinas may have detached.
What could have been `just another movie' is given remarkable elevation
by director Wayne Wang (`The Joy Luck Club') and the screen duo of Susan
Sarandon and Natalie Portman. The majority of the film is heavily
reliant on the believability of their relationship, especially when
considering the supporting cast is used sparsely, and even then the
actors are merely background strokes to paint a more attractive portrait
of the central conflict. Both Sarandon and Portman perform wonderfully,
and their emotions never ring hollow. Much like the recent underrated
romance `The Story of Us', the trials and tribulations of this mother
and daughter strike a powerful chord with the audience.
Moving out of Wisconsin and headed to Beverly Hills, Adele August
(Sarandon) and her daughter Ann (Natalie Portman) have already began a
feisty bout of feuding. Ann's occasional narration informs us of the
family background: her father left when she was young, Adele married for
a second time, and now the twosome are traveling to the palm
tree-infested locales of Beverly Hills to try and start over. But Ann
despises her mother in every sense of the word, and is eagerly awaiting
her chance to slip away to college back east and escape the domineering
matriarch who, naturally, only wants the best for her daughter. But even
with her tender care, she doesn't let Ann voice her opinion. It soon
becomes apparent that it is Adele's way... or the highway.
There was a sense of immense gratification as the credits began to roll
after `American Beauty'. What generated this rare sensation was the
realization that we had just experienced the lives of three perfectly
realized characters. The two female leads in `Anywhere but Here' are
hardly the polished characters that one would describe as `perfect', but
they're more than sufficient given the demands of the screenplay.
There's a hefty dose of realism present at virtually all times, and this
effect is improved a notch or two by the impeccable lead performances.
It's a touching and funny tale for anyone who's been in a situation
resembling the emotional challenge that Ann and Adele are facing.
I found myself thinking afterward that perhaps Wang was too generous
with the screen time of the central mother-to-daughter conflict. Once in
a while, a supporting character is given the floor, but mainly all
secondary performers are given the dramatic sidebar in this endless
Sarandon-Portman buffet of emotions. I wanted a far meatier role for
Hart Bochner, who plays a Beverly Hills orthodontist that Adele gets
involved with. It's hard to believe, but Bochner was that snotty,
bearded jerk who cowardly attempted to give Bruce Willis away to the
terrorists in `Die Hard' (yes - he has muscled up since then). Shawn
Hatosy (`Outside Providence') is effective but used sparingly as Ann's
cousin Benny. Corbin Alldred is flat-out charming as a likable doofus
pining for Ann's affection, and Michael Milhoan registers nicely as an
earnest cop who offers some wise to both of the ladies. Both, however,
could have been relied upon more often.
Sarandon is so good at this sort of thing. With her eagerness to bite
right into the role of Adele, there's absolutely no worries from minute
one. But I was pleasantly surprised with Natalie Portman. The young
actress was impressive as Queen Amidala in `The Phantom Menace', but the
role was too stale to warrant any real dramatics. Portman is
surprisingly strong alongside Sarandon, though, shedding tears without
the slightest whiff of inexperience.  After her appearance in `Episode
1', Portman could provide the biggest audience attraction for `Anywhere
but Here'.
I would recommend this film to anyone who thinks female characters have
been unfairly dismissed and underwritten as of late. `Anywhere but Here'
is anything but the case, adding believable emotions and sure-fire
direction to an otherwise tired formula. Bring with you only two things:
a loved one, and some Kleenex.

Title
Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
`Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon'.'
You may think Universal has intended this tagline, which has been
attached to the poster and commercial advertising campaign of the new
Andy Kaufman biopic, merely to reveal the role Carrey is playing. But
there is more to it than just that. Carrey doesn't settle on a simple
recreation of the late comedian, he inhabits the role - climbing right
into Kaufman's skin -  to deliver a triumphant performance so borderline
accurate that many will find the comparison to be frightening. This is
one of the most dedicated and remarkable performances I've ever
witnessed on screen. Carrey is already a dead ringer for the daring
comic, but he also envelops every ounce of his character to such a
startling degree we believe that this could be out-takes of the real
Andy Kaufman.
Now, if you've heard that Carrey is essentially the entire show, you've
heard right. But he's just so damn entertaining. Watching the gifted
comedian reenact all of Andy Kaufman's comic shenanigans - the
wrestling, the stand-up, the Latka - is truly an astonishing spectacle
to admire. `Man on the Moon' charts, with a sure-footed approach,
everything from Kaufman's rise to fame on the sitcom `Taxi' to his
sudden death from lung cancer in 1984. Is there really any exploration
into Kaufman's character, or some indication given of his aspirations as
an out-of-control comic? No. For the most part, director Milos Forman
leads us through `Man on the Moon' from the perspective of a curious
outsider. Andy Kaufman was hilarious to some, offensive and obnoxious to
others....and his actual nature remains a mystery to many (including the
filmmakers).
The film opens in a thoroughly ingenious and side-splitting manner, as
Carrey makes his first appearance as Kaufman on a black-and-white
backdrop. He explains that the movie actually sucks because many
significant details of his life have been edited and removed. He then
adds he has since edited the movie to meet his approval....and,
strangely enough, the film is now completely over. Carrey watches from
the sideline as the credits begin to roll, impatiently rolling his eyes
and swinging his arms - until the screen goes black. After an extended
moment of silence, which may cause slight confusion for some audience
members, Andy's head pops into the screen and explains he was merely
showcasing his unusual brand of humor. And then, the biographical side
of the movie commences.
This is the one and only time we see a flashback of Andy as a child, and
then Forman abruptly skips ahead to the introduction of agent George
Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who is impressed by Andy's stand-up routine and
offers him a stab at showbiz. From here, Andy's trails lead him to a
musical guest spot on `Saturday Night Live', where he mouths the words
to the `Mighty Mouse' theme song (to the audience's subsequent delight).
The chance of a lifetime knocks at the door when Andy is offered a role
on the sitcom `Taxi', where he is to translate his Foreign Man character
(previously seen on `Hollywood Squares') into an immigrant mechanic
named Latka. Andy sees sitcoms as the lowest form of humor, and demands
a few additional requirements; namely four separate guest spots for
Vegas lounge singer Tony Clifton - who (unbeknownst to many) is actually
Andy's obnoxious alter ego. Carrey's introductory appearance as Clifton
- a chubby, ill-tempered jerk layered with prosthetic makeup - receives
gales of laughter. The actor's immeasurable talent comes in handy in
imitating the absurd and shocking lengths Kaufman would go to for the
purpose of humor.
Both DeVito and Paul Giamatti (playing writing cohort and buddy Bob
Zmuda) are kept at a distance, but with their undeniable talent and
admirable restraint, they deliver adequate performances. A similar fate
is dealt to Courtney Love (who previously appeared in Forman's `The
People Vs Larry Flynt') as love interest Lynn Marguiles, an outsider who
is baffled by a great majority of Kaufman's outrageous (and prolonged)
acts. Love is terribly under-used, but her scenes with Carrey strike a
certain poignancy, and minor details of their relationship are charming.
There are amusing cameos from the former cast of `Taxi' (including
Christopher Lloyd, Carol Kane, Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner), but this
is strictly Jim Carrey's turf. Even close friends and relatives of Andy
have been astonished by his dead-on portrayal. The research process
Carrey must have gone through is almost unfathomable.
Forman directs in a wise, entertaining manner - but do we truly realize
who Andy Kaufman was and what he was striving for? `Man on the Moon'
lacks the answer to a few vitally important questions, but at the same
time, it celebrates Andy Kaufman's life with more dedication and proper
acceptance than any other recreation could. Perhaps the true inner being
of Andy Kaufman was best left to Kaufman himself - but his story is
certainly an entertaining one.

Title
Review for General's Daughter, The (1999)
Starring-John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton,
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
I don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into
thinking the plot is interesting, when in fact it's ludicrous. In the
case of The General's Daughter, the plot is more than capable of
intriguing you to a certain point. But at this juncture in the story,
the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie. This predictable
summer thriller is only sporadically involving, and that is
unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws.
Get past one moment early on where John Travolta exercises his southern
accent, and you're likely to survive this entire movie. Travolta plays
Criminal Investigations Divisions officer Paul Brenner, who's working
undercover at a military base when another situation arises: the
apparent rape and murder of a young female officer (Leslie Stefanson).
It turns out that the victim is the daughter of General Joe Campbell
(James Cromwell). Let the investigation begin.
With the assistance of fellow CID investigator Sarah Sunhill (played
rather on-the-sidelines by Madeleine Stowe), Brenner uncovers what
appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case. Things begin to
get marginally engrossing when we meet Colonel Moore (James Woods), a
former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his
sleeve. Woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he
oozes authority, surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar.
With echoes of his supporting role in True Crime, in which he duked it
out with Clint Eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges, he makes
every moment believable. Here though, the intense dialogue comes care of
confrontations with Travolta, as the two send mindful, knowing glares
across the room. There are many scenes such as this in The General's
Daughter, in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure,
but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to
absorb.
Director Simon West (Con Air), shows a watchful eye of delivering a
stylish looking thriller, but he fails miserably when it comes to the
intellectual part of it. The General's Daughter is, more often than not,
a predictable and unexciting mess. It does not help matters that the
plot is virtually actionless, dragging it's heels all the way at a
mind-numbing snails pace. A few brief action scenes, marvelously handled
in the editing department, show that the movie could have delivered such
a more proficient package. From a director who does such a great job of
staging explosions and miraculous stunts, I suggest West should stick
with mindless, rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future
projects like this.
Still, the movie is certainly not without it's merits. The acting is
very good from the majority of the experienced cast. The performances
range from commanding (Travolta) to electric (Woods) to stiff-as-a-board
(Cromwell, who doesn't show off his real talents here). Madeleine Stowe
manages to hold her own for a while, but as the female lead in an
action-thriller, she doesn't pull through sufficiently.
One of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable.
>From minute one, I had few doubts about the identity of the killer in
question. The script even unwillingly points him out for us, using
familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the
end. In all fairness, we've seen many of the devices used in The
General's Daughter put to greater effect in other films.
The secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually,
but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it
feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly. The General's Daughter is not
a terrible movie, and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's
attention span for a certain period of time. But it just could have been
so much better.

Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one. The
screenplay, written by co-star Steve Martin, skewers everything in
Hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight
sequences, and all in a crafty and accomplished manner. Anyone who knows
of, or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy
this clever comedy for it's entire duration.
The central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one.
Bobby Bowfinger (Martin), a cheapskate and small-time Hollywood
producer, has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but
has never attained the proper tools to do so. A new script, an alien
invasion story entitled Chubby Rain, has caught Bowfinger's eye. After
confronting a big-name producer named Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.)
in a restaurant, an agreement is made to finance the movie. But first,
Bowfinger must get renowned action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to
sign in on the project. Kit turns the offer down immediately, but
Bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film. After emptying out his
life savings, the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew
that Ramsey is involved, and then prepares to film the movie without the
star's knowledge.
The actors confront Ramsey on the street, saying their lines as hidden
cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage. The unknowing star,
who is terrified of aliens and being abducted, is brought to believe
there is actually pod people after him. When the conditions become even
more treacherous, Bowfinger is forced to hire a Kit Ramsey look-alike
named Jiff (also Murphy), a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee
in-between shooting vital scenes. These include attempting a suicide run
across an 8-lane freeway, and one of the `hot' scenes involving
supporting actress Daisy (Heather Graham) removing her blouse.
Bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started, but when the plot
switches into high gear, great things happen. Certain scenes are so
precisely executed, perfectly framing moments that are absolutely
fall-down funny. No, hilarious. Standouts include the chase through a
parking garage in which Ramsey, who's supposed to be being followed,
keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise (it's
actually Bowfinger's dog in high heels). And just try not to laugh in
the climactic kung-fu sequence, featuring Jiff in an excerpt from
another Bowfinger classic entitled Fake Purse Ninjas. While the entire
97-minutes of Bowfinger isn't always on target, individual scenes may
have you rolling in the aisles.
Masterful comedy director Frank Oz (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, In and
Out), who has never made a bad movie, ensures a quality final product
and is aided immensely by Martin's sharp-edged script. However, the real
on-screen star is Eddie Murphy. This is the actor's finest work since
his breakthrough into the Hollywood market in the early 80's. Murphy
excels at every corner, not only succeeding with presenting believable
paranoia in the eyes of Kit Ramsey, but in creating a likable buffoon in
Jiff as well. These three talented comic minds have squeezed every
morsel of potential out of this premise, and the reward is a virtually
guaranteed helping of hearty laughs.
Steve Martin generates the power behind Bowfinger, but Murphy fuels it.
This is a summer-time comedy that, unlike something such as American Pie
and South Park, doesn't break any rules. But it's still just as
uproarious, or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen
this season. The supporting cast, including Christine Baranski as a
work-loving actress and Jamie Kennedy as the cameraman, all perform well
within their limits. The only presence that demands real attention when
placed next to Martin or Murphy is the beautiful Heather Graham, as the
young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top. Graham,
attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new Powers'
girl in AP2, displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely
corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay.
I wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for Chubby Rain, but watching
how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough.

Title
Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
Starring-Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette, Michael
Clarke Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet and Kevin Pollak
Director-Johnathan Lynn
Canadian Rating-14A
In `The Whole Nine Yards', everyone is eager to whack someone else,
whether the incentive is marital difficulties or business. For Jimmy
`The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a hitman formerly associated with
the notorious Gogalack crime family in Chicago, it's strictly business.
After supplying the FBI with evidence against the Gogalack family and
serving his 5-year prison term, The Tulip has relocated to Montreal,
Quebec to hide out. His new neighbor, the `poor dentist' Nick Oseransky
(Matthew Perry), recognizes his mug immediately because he once
maintained a dental practice in the Windy City. And so begins `The Whole
Nine Yards', a surprisingly enjoyable farce that jettisons some of its
comedic appeal in favor of crafting a rather convoluted storyline.
For Matthew Perry, the transition from `Friends' to the big screen has
been occupied with unpleasant turbulence. Contrary to most, I somewhat
enjoyed his two critically battered romantic vehicles `Fools Rush In'
and `Three to Tango'.... but despite his perceptible charm and gifted
comic timing, the actor has carried with him a wretched box office curse
in whatever film he inhabits. Hopefully, `The Whole Nine Yards' will put
an end to that mean streak. After all, the movie stars Mr. Box Office
himself, Bruce Willis - whose career seems to have been jump-started
once again by the little supernatural thriller that could (`The Sixth
Sense'). Tack on a talented supporting cast willing to experiment with
an accent or two, and the result is a fairly perky and energetic comic
stew containing just enough clever zeal and enthusiasm to fill a 2-hour
gap quite entertainingly.
The plot will sound complicated to most, but once you get a taste of
`The Whole Nine Yards' first-hand, everything will level out in a
straightforward fashion. Once Tudeski moves in, Oseransky (or `Oz') gets
overwrought with panic. His miserly Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna
Arquette), who has made the union of marriage hell for Oz, persuades him
to travel to Chicago and inform the Gogalack family of Tudeski's
whereabouts (the method of persuasion being that she will grant him a
divorce). But this is only the start of the intricate shenanigans, as
Jimmy's lovely wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), Nick's bubbly
receptionist Jill (Amanda Peet) and behemoth underling Frankie Figs
(Michael Clarke Duncan) all get involved in the fiasco. The plot is so
convoluted that it causes you to speculate about what director Jonathan
Lynn's primary concerns were. If the layout of `The Whole Nine Yards'
was a race track, the shady mobster/hitman portion of the plot would
have lapped the humor five times over.
Fortunately, the film still has its laughs. Lynn, who has done good (`My
Cousin Vinny') and not-so-good (`Sgt. Bilko'), keeps the pace churning
at a consistent momentum, and his slick approach leaves little margin
for error. Although `The Whole Nine Yards' deals with somber dealings
like murder and double-crosses, most of the film has a light, puckery
taste to it. This agreeable flavor is largely due to the beaming
supporting cast - particularly Amanda Peet, whose terrific comic
performance lends a sense of illumination to every scene she's in.
Meanwhile, Henstridge (the babalicious alien from `Species') shows us
her surprising competence with giving a strong serious performance, and
Duncan (the Oscar-nominated actor from `The Green Mile') occupies the
character of Frankie Figs like few others could. The only general
exception is Rosanna Arquette, who is mainly just shill and grating with
the character of Sophie, and her highly inconsistent `Canadian' accent
reveals that she maybe forgot to do any research whatsoever.
The most interesting accent of the show belongs to the funny Kevin
Pollak, playing imposing (and rather unintelligent) mob boss Yanni
Gogalack, who introduces Cynthia as `Yimmy's vife'. In a way similar to
Yanni's verbal clumsiness, `The Whole Nine Yards' has its priorities in
a tangle. The script straddles two separate genres and sometimes reveals
a gaping hole of incompetence. The film itself is a bit off-centered,
but Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis know every nook and cranny of their
characters, and their one-two punch of forceful tough guy and suburban
doofus helps add to the entertainment value of the film. `The Whole Nine
Yards' is not as fulfilling as the title may suggest, but as a comedy,
it is still more leisurely than most.

Review for 8MM (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
8MM is not going to enlighten your day. It's a dark, grimy and
disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive
violence. Not only do you need the stomach to make it through this
bloated mess, you'll require a lot of patience as well.
Nicolas Cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late. He
wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful
Snake Eyes, and here he attempts a performance that can relate to
someone completely losing their grip on reality. Cage plays Private
Investigator Tom Welles, praised for his secrecy and reliability. At
home, Welles is a family man, with a wife (Catherine Keener) and a small
daughter to take care of. His new assignment is a bizarre one: the wife
of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery
regarding a film found  in her husband's safe. The film appears to be
some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked
man, until the girl is brutally murdered. Or so it seems.
Welles, of course, begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the
truth. And the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case, the
more he gets in over his head. He hires an adult book store clerk named
Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) to be his guide through the ugly
underworld of pornography. Max knows what Welles is getting himself
into, and explains, `you dance with the devil, the devil don't change.
The devil changes you.' These turn out to be very wise words.
8MM has a premise that begs for a better execution. The set-up is slick
and well played, as Cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels
to Hollywood to locate her. This is where everything goes awry. Although
director Joel Schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque
portrait of the `real world', he forgot to inject any interest or
excitement to the formula. Everything about the movie becomes dull and
lifeless, repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects.
Although it had enormous potential, the third act of 8MM is a total
bust, leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme
disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control.
Cage is the film's sole flame of energy. His performance is actually
believable, but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on
his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation. Still, you've
got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he
did, for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand.
Welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker (played convincingly
by Peter Stormare) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films
in the industry. This is where Cage goes over the edge into a serial
killer-like phase, in which he must take revenge on all those who
murdered the innocent girl in the film. He tracks down the masked man
responsible for the killing (Chris Bauer), and they have a bloody brawl
in the local cemetery, a fight sequence that would look more at home in
a Schwarzenegger movie. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, 8MM dissipates
into a poor man's Seven, with all the violence but little of the
effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece.
Furthermore, what has become of Joel Schumacher? The director has
recently experienced a major drought, slumming in the depths of dismal
flop after flop (Batman and Robin, anyone?). This putrid thriller is
certainly not going to revive his career, so perhaps Schumacher should
start exploring his lighter side.

Review for True Crime (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:   http://welcome.to/movieviews
Veteran actor Clint Eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in
True Crime, his latest directorial effort. When Steve Everett (his
newest character) gets angry at someone, he glares them down with those
famous Dirty Harry eyes, furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear
who's just lost his cubs. Eastwood has played some particularly
despicable characters in his time, but Everett could just take the cake.
He gets my vote, at least, partly because `Ev' is a drunken
affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems, very few of
which are with his wife (Diane Venora). When his colleague at the
Oakland Tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies, Everett must take over
for her at a vital interview session. The interview is with Frank
Beacham (Isaiah Washington), a death-row inmate set to die at midnight
for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk. Eastwood furrows
his brow.
As Everett gradually finds information, he realizes that Beacham could
very well be innocent. He interviews a key witness (Michael Jeter), who
claims that he burst in the door at Pocum's Foods because his car had
overheated, only to see Beacham standing over the dead woman's body,
blood on his suspenders, gun in hand. But Everett protests: how could he
have seen the gun, which was lowered by his side, with the potato chip
rack in front of him? Jeter doesn't know what he's talking about.
Eastwood furrows his brow.
Crinkled expressions and all, Clint is the centre of  energy of True
Crime. The film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn, but a
thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the
shoot-outs. Isaiah Washington has a break-out performance as Frank
Beacham, and scenes with him and his weary wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) are
truly heartfelt moments. But the best scenes are ones that feature
Eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him. Denis Leary, as
Everett's editor and boss, has more than a few memorable moments of
restrained anger (you see, Ev is sleeping with his wife). But hands
down, the most enjoyable segments of the film are when James Woods is on
camera. Playing the big boss Alan Mann, Woods and Eastwood create
amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines.
When True Crime opts for a high-speed chase to the Governer's house at
the finale, the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive.
Eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he
didn't need to switch lanes. True Crime is a tension-building,
intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star. This is a
road block he could have easily dismissed (I furrow my brow).

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
As South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut opens, the citizens of the
famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune. The birds
are chirping, the sun is shining, and the friendly inhabitants are
smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune. Enter
the foursome of Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny, the infamous group of
elementary school children that the TV show is based upon. They see an
ad bearing the names of their favorite fart-lighting duo of Terrance and
Phillip, who are appearing in their very first feature length movie (a
Canadian production). And so they venture forth to the local cineplex,
where they are shamefully turned down from seeing this graphic, R-rated
feature. After bribing a homeless man to accompany them as their
`parental guardian', the boys make it in to watch the movie, unaware
that the profane language they learn will soon thereafter destroy their
quiet and peaceful town.
South Park is a TV show that grew immensely popular on Comedy Central.
Mostly, of course, with the less demanding younger viewers, who found
the idea of swearing and offensive cardboard children to be just their
cup of tea. Now that co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are free of
their television rating confines, they have pushed the envelope as far
as it can possibly go. The South Park movie is more raunchy, vulgar and
repeatedly crude than anything you have probably ever seen. The
obscenities flow so consistently that unwilling viewers may be scarred
for life, left to babble on in profane gibberish. The reason the film
exists is that Parker and Stone can take revenge on the MPAA (that's the
Motion Picture Association of America), with whom they've experienced a
complicated past. But, they won't stop there.
How many groups, minorities and individuals does the South Park movie
stab in the back? With the exception of the MPAA, there is (*ahem*)
black people, Jewish people, gay people, Anne Murray, Celine Dion, Jar
Jar Binks, the Baldwin brothers, Saddam Hussein, Brian Boitano, Bill
Gates, Barbara Streisand, and most blatantly of all: Canada! Parker and
Stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we
Canadians, from speech patterns to flag-wearing and beyond. It would be
advisable for anyone who is easily offended to avoid this film, at ALL
costs.
But back to the plot. After the South Park children begin to utter
shocking four-letter words as part of their regular vocabulary, the
mothers take action. Forming MAC (Mothers Against Canada), they take
their case to President Clinton, forcing him to proclaim war on the
neighboring country for polluting the American children's minds with
their obscene movie productions. Terrance and Phillip are thereby
scheduled to be executed, with a pre-celebrity bash including Winona
Ryder and Big Gay Al. The South Park children decide to band together,
stop the bloodbath, and save the lives of their acting icons before all
is lost.
Let me first say that I laughed. Lord help me, I nearly busted a gut
during some uproarious musical numbers. Yes, in case you didn't know
already, the South Park movie is basically a feature-length animated
musical. The lyrics are often side-splitting and many of the songs have
an enjoyable beat, especially the re-enactment of the widely cherished
`Kyle's Mom's a B--ch', performed with eager enthusiasm by Cartman
himself. As a sub-plot, Kenny sets himself on fire while attempting to
light his own fart, and descends to hell. There he meets Satan, who is
having a heated affair with none other than Saddam Hussein. For such
(intentionally) crummy animation, there are some impressive
computer-generated visuals down below. Unfortunately, this and many
other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into
disgusting vulgarity. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut nearly
received an NC-17 from the MPAA, and for good reason; this film is not
for young audiences.
While a half-hour episode is nicely filling, the 90-minute movie begins
to lose fuel as it nears the conclusion. But some sequences are so
hilarious, and some pop culture references so cleverly placed, you just
have to appreciate the effort. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut
breaks every rule in the book, and if you have the courage, you just
might find it entertaining.

Review for Cider House Rules, The (1999)
In anticipation of the John Irving adaptation `The Cider House Rules', I
imagine audiences were more skeptical than optimistic. Although Irving's
novels have been revised to big-screen format in such gems as `The World
According to Garp', the most recent example was the sentimental 1998
drama `Simon Birch' - a film that Irving reportedly detested to such a
degree that he wanted his name removed from the finished product. In
addition, the production of `The Cider House Rules' represents a 13-year
battle for theatrical redemption. But surely don't scoff and dismiss it
as another boring sentimental weeper, because `Cider House' actually
offers a touching human story with a finely textured dramatic impact. To
pass it up would not be a substantial mistake, but the experience is
light, moving and ultimately worth your while.
The story opens during the mid-1940's at an orphanage in St. Clouds,
Maine, where Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) has resided for his entire
life. Homer was denied admittance into the army because of a heart
defect, and so he has stayed to help the kindly old head physician Dr.
Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) conduct deliveries and illegal abortions.
When young couple Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Air Force pilot
Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) arrive at St. Clouds with a request
for the latter, Homer spots an opportunity to depart and begin a life of
his own. Once out in the world, he is given his first view of the
rippling waves of the ocean and is graciously offered a job in an apple
orchard owned by Wally and his mother. Here, living in the Cider House
with Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his employees, Homer finds a
comfortable niche away from the orphanage. And when Lt. Worthington is
called into battle, a romantic subplot develops between Homer and Candy,
who (as it turns out) are hopelessly in love with each other.
Quite simply, `The Cider House Rules' is a movie of subplots. Another
particularly shocking one, involving Mr. Rose and his young daughter
(Erykah Badu), also culminates as the film reaches the meat of the story
during its second half. I suspect that, without these involving examples
of threading the central coming-of-age story together, the film could
have toppled altogether like a clumsy house of cards. The process of
evaluating Irving's novel to the fullest and discovering the morals and
values of Homer's journey is a somewhat overlong (and occasionally
aimless) exercise for director Lasse Hallstrom and company. Ultimately
though, the film peaks during the climactic moments in dramatic
satisfaction without even beginning to get excessive, and the rough
patches earlier are overcome by a string of marvelous performances from
a top-notch ensemble cast.
Maguire (`Pleasantville') is totally believable as the chief protagonist
in `The Cider House Rules', and his earlier scenes with Caine (shining
brightly in an Oscar-nominated performance) are among the most effective
in the film. Theron (the rising star of `Mighty Joe Young' and `The
Astronaut's Wife') is superbly convincing as the character of Candy, who
deals with grueling issues that will be easily related to. The remainder
of the cast (including the always forceful Delroy Lindo) deliver uniform
performances of greatness. Backed by a beautifully flowing musical score
by Rachel Portman and gorgeous cinematography courtesy of Oliver
Stapleton, `The Cider House Rules' moves melodiously until Homer's
journey has come to a close, offering several Kodak moments of poignancy
and good-natured humor along the journey.
Looking back on the film, I'm finding it difficult to properly interpret
some of the underlying messages that Hallstrom was attempting to
identify. At times, `The Cider House Rules' becomes a victim of its own
leisurely agenda - in hindsight, the cream filling is more tasteless
than it seemed as I was exiting the theater. But `Cider House' still
manages to win you over with its sublimely moving story, even if the
emotional depth you were hoping for never fully arises. John Irving
should be pleased with this finished product, and for that matter, so
should you. `The Cider House Rules' induces a rewarding smile as the
curtain closes, and that seems sufficient enough.

Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
The release of Stir of Echoes is a stroke of good luck. Audiences have
been widely flocking to the supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense, which
is essentially a ghost story with a unique twist. Perhaps they're in the
mood for another offering from beyond the grave. If this is the case,
Stir of Echoes is just the film everyone is looking for - it's a
masterful creation brimming with moments that succeed in causing
goosebumps. Even if The Sixth Sense continues to conquer the box office,
this second offering still manages to hook you from minute one and never
lose it's grip on suspense.
Kevin Bacon (after baring all in Wild Things) plays Tom Witzky, a
telephone lineman who lives a settled life with his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) and son Jake (Zachary David Cope). One night, during a
neighborhood keg party, Maggie's sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) describes
to the group the magical art of hypnosis. Tom (who is drunk at the
time), encourages Lisa to hypnotize him for the group's entertainment.
The method in which writer/director David Keopp (Jurassic Park) presents
the scene is both intriguing and expertly executed; a model for other
films to follow.
After the hypnotism, Tom begins to see frightening images in his mind.
These all seem to be centered around the spirit of a young girl, who
appears in front of eyes in the most surprising places. Tom thinks he is
losing his mind, but he turns to his little boy for an interesting
discovery: Jake has the ability to see the ghost as well. Tom realizes
that he is chosen for something important. What this is, he doesn't
exactly know.
As a ghost story, Stir of Echoes is both frightening and refreshing.
Keopp has balanced the familiar elements well, finishing with a product
that glues the attentive viewer to their seat for the entire running
time. The mood is established early, and the sheer professionalism never
drops even a smidgen. Everything involving the set-up of the film is
masterful: swooping and winding camera angles that recall Stanley
Kubrick's best work, believable performances in the key roles of Tom and
Maggie, and some genuinely effective atmosphere that builds efficiently
for a few great scares. Adapting from Richard Matheson's novel, Keopp's
material isn't always on target, but his technical presentation is
absolutely perfect.
In the lead role, Bacon delivers a very solid performance. His character
is easier to relate to than most, and because of this, we accept his
unusual situation with ease. In supporting roles, Illeana Douglas and
Kevin Dunn are both immensely reliable, as is the talented Erbe and
young Cope. Stir of Echoes marks the second good performance from a
child actor in the past month - although Haley Joel Osment's in The
Sixth Sense is more than just 組ood', it's deserving of award
recognition. While first I must cross my fingers that Haley gets a
nomination at Oscar time, I've got to commend Cope's wonderful
presentation also.
I mentioned earlier that the set-up of Stir of Echoes is impeccable. The
second half, I'm afraid, isn't quite as good. Keopp begins to lean
toward more conventional thinking, and the momentum begins to fade
slightly. Still, you've got to hand it to him. Where the director shows
a weakness in one area, he compensates for it in another. His screenplay
is always well-written, and although some audience members may predict
the ending before it eventually rolls around, Keopp's marvelous
direction always has us strapped in.
Not only is this an intellectually superior thriller, but everything
about it is distinctly eye-catching. The use of the colors red and white
is effective (particularly the first, used during a lot in instant
flashes). As we are taken along Tom's bizarre breakdown, the surprises
are clever and consistent. The film has a brain, and uses it well,
making for a unique and frightening experience at the cinema.

Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
With the huge early summer hit Notting Hill under their belts, both Hugh
Grant and Julia Roberts are trying to duplicate that success with
another round of romance this season. Roberts teamed up again with
Richard Gere for the altar comedy Runaway Bride, and now Grant is trying
his hand at the Mafia spoof Mickey Blue Eyes. Despite coming so soon
after Analyze This, the Englishman uses his naive charm and manages to
fuel this predictable but cute comedy simply by using his puppy dog
eyes.
You know the look. Grant has used it to his advantage ever since Four
Weddings and a Funeral. It's this `I'm in over my head / I can't believe
I'm doing this' expression that coats Mickey Blue Eyes with an
appealing, totally charming glaze. I don't know, someday maybe it will
get old. But for now, his innocent looks and actions perfectly suit
comedy vehicles such as this.
Grant plays Michael Felgate, an art auctioneer who's about to get in
over his head. Michael is hopelessly in love with a pretty
school-teacher named Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and after some
complications involving a botched fortune cookie message, he asks for
her hand in marriage. Gina backs out immediately to Michael's confusion,
and afterward when he confronts her, she explains: `I can't marry you
because of my father'. As it turns out, Frank Vitale (James Caan) is an
influential figure in the mob. Gina wants to avoid any involvement
Michael could have with the rest of the `family'.
While I won't deny that Mickey Blue Eyes is consistently amusing, it
doesn't have the great comedic tag team of Robert DeNiro and Billy
Crystal that gave Analyze This it's extra juice. However, casting
remains a bright spot. Grant, although displaying marginal range, is
delightful in the vital role of Michael. When he's forced to create an
alter ego his mob ties, the character of Mickey Blue Eyes is concocted.
Seeing Grant attempt to speak Mafia jargon (`No R's,' advises Frank.
`And replace the T's with D's') is truly hilarious. James Caan makes for
a worthy adversary, and although he is not the perfect choice for the
role, his veteran craftsmanship (gained from The Godfather) helps a
great deal. The only tiny loose end is Tripplehorn, who plays her role
too aggressively to be likable. Although admittedly attractive,
Tripplehorn lacks the vibrance and charisma needed to fill the shoes of
Gina.
The supporting cast is full of familiar faces that generally populate
mob movies. Burt Young is dignified and effective as Uncle Vito, the
head of the family, but there is never any humor explored in his
character. Joe Viterelli (hilarious as the bodyguard in Analyze This)
has a similar role as Vinnie. But again, his character is played far too
straight - particularly when considering what a successful stretch he
had in the previous film. The remainder of the cast is made up of a
troupe of gangster types you would expect.
Director Kelly Makin (Kids in the Hall) often takes the easy route for
the humor, but the accomplished stars only make it funnier. There are
lots of double-crosses and plot twists towards the end - mainly
involving the FBI at a final wedding ceremony - but most are entirely
predictable. Still, this is pretty funny stuff. The script is fast and
efficient enough to make us forget certain character problems, and the
gags are often expertly polished. It's not like we haven't seen this
material before, but the charm and overall appeal of the actors is
difficult to resist.
How does this stack up with Analyze This? Well, basically the same,
except for one small detail: Mickey Blue Eyes is probably better
equipped with more crowd-pleasing moments. And Grant and Caan nicely
compensate for the loss of DeNiro and Crystal - mostly a fair
comparison, if you ask me.

Title
Review for Analyze This (1999)
It must be tough to be a mob boss. Just ask Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro),
a man who finds his job as Mafia head to be rather stress inducing. I
can believe it, too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must
go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick, baseball bat
or sledgehammer to torture victims with. Suffering from reoccurring
panic attacks, Paul decides he needs to consult some professional help.
And who better than Billy Crystal. After appearing in
bottom-of-the-barrel flops, Father's Day and My Giant, Crystal finally
finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here. Playing
Vitti's private shrink, the two very different stars strike an
unorthodox, but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable
comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish. Casting Robert
DeNiro as Paul Vitti is something of an in-joke, I think. Placed in this
mobster's shoes, DeNiro gets to spoof  characters he himself played in
films like The Godfather, Part II and Casino. It's obvious he's having a
lot of fun doing so.
The man behind the camera is Harold Ramis, whose credits include
Ghostbusters (as writer and star), and his best directing effort, the
Bill Murray vehicle, Groundhog Day. Ramis has a knack for drawing laughs
because he simply knows what's funny, and here he manages to accentuate
the strengths of nearly all the actors. The only character who weakens
the payoff is Crystal's bride-to-be (Lisa Kudrow). Playing the same
dumbed-down role as she does in Friends, Kudrow is amusing, but doesn't
fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped.
The supporting cast sparkles. Joe Viterelli is hilarious as Jelly,
Vitti's pea brained right-hand man, and Chazz Palminteri is a show
stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the
definition of `closure'. The movie manages to maintain
consistent chuckles throughout, putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really
big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides. The
situation is just too cute to resist.
It's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand. But hey,
if you're in the Mafia, using obscenities probably comes naturally. And
near the end, seeing Billy Crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob
boss is truly a special treat.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
Starring-Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, Greg Kinnear,
John Goodman, Ben Kingsley and Linda Fiorentino
Director-Mike Nichols
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Columbia Pictures - 03/00
After a wearisome floating space disclaimer akin to the `Star Wars'
movies, the alien sex comedy `What Planet Are You From?' changes its
setting to an environment that many audience members will likely find
disturbing. In a futuristic auditorium on a distant planet, there is
row-upon-row of men. These men seem to be the sole inhabitants of a
planet which has focused their highly advanced technology on a universal
takeover. Their latest target is Earth. One chosen member of the alien
colony is to travel to Earth, whereupon he will impregnate a single
female with his extraterrestrial seed so that the hostile takeover may
commence. The lucky guy is H1449-6 (Garry Shandling), who will adopt the
name Harry Anderson and be given a special reproductive attachment to
fulfill his mission. An unexpected side effect: when excited, Harry's
genitalia hums.
And so marks the basis of this loosely amusing but scattershot and
disorderly comedy from veteran director Mike Nichols, who previously
pulled a comedic ace out of his sleeve with `The Birdcage' in 1996.
`What Planet Are You From?' is a pet project that Shandling has been
nursing for four years, and with such an array of versatile talent
involved, the film itself is more than a trifle underwhelming. Although
it boasts some hearty belly laughs and a generally sweet and warmhearted
nature, `What Planet Are You From?' leaves the chalky residue of a movie
that fails to meet its original promise. The film is mundane and watery,
but once you're in the presence of its harmless approach of genial
nonchalance, you'll find it agreeable just the same.
The cast certainly tweaks the curiosity. Once on Earth, Harry's sleazy
co-worker Perry Gordon (Greg Kinnear) takes him to an AA meeting to
scope the chicks. Susan Hart (Annette Bening), a free-spirited soul
attempting to start again from square one in the relationship circle, is
the woman he meets there. Now, back on his distant home planet, Harry
was lectured in the proper methods to pick up an Earth woman (so that he
may impregnate her later, of course). These methods include `telling the
Earth female she smells nice' and `complimenting her on her stylish
shoes.' Once he finds himself in the heat of the battle, Harry discovers
that smooth-talking a lady isn't as elementary as perhaps anticipated.
Watching side-splitting sequences such as Harry and Susan's first date
are like rainbow sprinkles dispersed over this otherwise bland vanilla
concoction, because Shandling's perfected sense of comic timing is given
time to shine. It's unfortunate that there isn't more screen time
dedicated to these bare essentials; instead, Nichols' and company sculpt
the film into a feel-good drama. And multiple subplots weave through the
central plot, including the infatuation of Federal Aviation Agent Roland
Jones (John Goodman), who is very much onto Harry.
Even when it does shift gears into a light romantic comedy, featuring
Harry developing human emotions, `What Planet Are You From?' is sweet
and innocuous. But at the same time, it feels oddly detached and
careless, like it was assembled by chimpanzees equipped with scotch
tape. Numerous loose ends are never tied up, and the screenplay
frequently declines the opportunity to chart further into the realm of
comedic possibilities. Luckily, the enjoyable supporting cast is full of
bright and enjoyable faces. Kinnear reverses personalities and is fun as
the arrogant jerk, while Goodman and Ben Kingsley (as the leader of the
alien race) offer reliable support. The only certified shame is the
thorough waste of Linda Fiorentino (`Dogma'), who plays Perry's alluring
wife in a mere window dressing role.
Believe it or not, Shandling and Bening actually make a cute couple. The
lack of progress achieved with his character is neutralized by Bening's
lively, lovable performance, and the
pair together spark a sensation of innocent charm. They amplify the
otherwise rickety second half of `What Planet Are You From?' to
enjoyable romantic fluff. In certain spots, it's also laugh-out-loud
funny... so collectively, why does `Planet' unhinge? It would be the
overdose of humming penis jokes if that particular sight gag wasn't
fresh and inspired. No, it's the fact that the film seems to be
puttering along without a piece of its own anatomy... this one being
closer to the heart. The only otherworldly aspect of `What Planet Are
You From?' is that, with such a terrific cast and experienced director,
the finished product isn't funnier.

Title
Review for Skulls, The (2000)
Starring-Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Leslie Bibb, Craig T. Nelson,
Hill Harper, William Peterson, Christopher McDonald and Steve Harris
Director-Rob Cohen
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Universal Pictures - 03/00
`The Skulls' is a laughably bad thriller, a teen-orientated doppelganger
of `The Firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a
hypnotic stupor. Certain moments are so preposterous that I nearly
herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter. I chuckled
incessantly, all the way home. Let me share.
The Skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of Yale
(designed, I'm sure, to mirror the actual Skull & Bones from the same
college). Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), a townie and local varsity
rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year, highlights
the latest Skull scouting report. Despite some anxiety and caution from
others, Luke accepts entry into the organization. Soon after, he finds
himself surrounded by beautiful women, driving a new car and marveling
at the $20, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account. Yeah, dude,
pretty good deal eh? But Luke soon learns that the membership is
somewhat suffocating; when circumstances become extreme, there is no way
he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable. The
premise, although lacking in originality, certainly offers its share of
potential intrigue and suspense.
Unfortunately, `The Skulls' is neither intriguing, nor suspenseful, nor
anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting. It's just
another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack, the stars....
but not the script. `The Skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of
entertainment value, with the screenplay, by Jon Pogue, immediately
becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . First off, upon
their initiation into The Skulls, each new member has to have a skull
branded onto their arm. Afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch
that conveniently covers up the scar. Will they never take this watch
off? And what if they forget it by their bedside? Perhaps their secret'
society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand
new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed.
On top of this, they are each given a rulebook and a key to
headquarters. Gee, why not member T-shirts? But my favorite bit is this:
the voting committee for The Skulls does not bother with individual
agree' or disagree' notions when making collective decisions. They are
given official Skull paddles. When flipped to one side, they indicate
the member agrees with the proposal. Facing the opposite way means a
disagreement. Wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally? Hell no.
They have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote, and maybe afterward
they can play Ping-Pong.
I'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details, but the humiliating
dialogue is enough to send one into arrest. The cast, meanwhile,
combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `Dawson's Creek'
crowd, and fuses the two together, ensuring that the embarrassment will
be a mutually shared union throughout. But not entirely. Accomplished
actors like Craig T. Nelson (as Skulls chairman Judge Litten Mandrake)
and William Peterson (as fellow board member Senator Levritt) are dealt
pathetic villain caricatures, and look suitably embarrassed handling
them. And then there's Christopher McDonald, who has the capacity to be
a fun, exciting actor. McDonald's charisma is totally diminished here as
he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role (yes, Pogue makes
it a hat-trick). I pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise
for all these actors.
The young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better. Let's
cut the talented Canadian lad Joshua Jackson some slack for maintaining
believability within the confines of his character. Paul Walker, the
strapping quarterback from `Varsity Blues', is bland but passable as
Caleb Mandrake - the Judge's son. Walker preserves a straight face, even
when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie (`Dad, I just killed a guy
in the ritual room!'). Some actual spark is generated by Leslie Bibb,
who plays Luke's longtime chum Chloe, and manages to successfully pull
off some convincing dramatics. It really boils down to the actors
attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that
cages them from minute one. Or maybe not minute one, thanks to a decent
set-up from director Rob Cohen, who films early sequences with a sense
of atmosphere and style. It makes you wonder why he didn't flee
indefinitely from the project, because while enjoyable cheese like
`Dragonheart' and the moderate Stallone thriller `Daylight' aren't
superior cinema, they belong on the AFI Top 100 list when compared to
this degrading trash.
Aside from unintentionally humoring the audience, `The Skulls' gets
little accomplished. The thrills and action are lazy and mechanical. The
story is stuffed with ridiculous, formulaic plotting that sheepishly
overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick.
Instead of gaining knowledge about The Skulls as an organization, we are
thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed
barnacles from excessive usage. We've seen it all before, and better.
`The Skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity, so miscalculated
that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like boneheaded'
seems just too generous.

Review for Lake Placid (1999)
Lake Placid is probably the best rampaging crocodile movie I've ever
seen. Oh wait... it's the only one I've ever seen. Yes, ruling out
1980's Alligator (which, of course, was about a rampaging alligator),
Lake Placid is in a league of it's own. Or... is it?
The set-up is short and sweet. After a mysterious and grizzly murder on
a small lake in Maine, local Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) calls
in the necessary officials. They include Fish and Game warden Jack Wells
(Bill Pullman) and New York palaeontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda),
called in to investigate an unusually large reptilian tooth found at the
murder scene. After they bicker for a while about the greeny locales and
buggy atmosphere, the group stumbles upon something very interesting
inhabiting the lake. Hint: it's not a giant mutated beaver.  It's a
30-foot crocodile which has supposedly swam all the way from Asian
waters and found a home in the peaceful confines of Black Lake. And so
they have to blow the croc up before it manages to chow down on more
local residents.
Actually, there is only one local: an eccentric old woman (played by
Betty White) who has adopted the big reptile as a pet, and feeds it her
own livestock on a regular basis. Former Golden Girl White spews out
many obscenities at the officials when they try to interfere, especially
when  they start asking questions about the strange disappearance of her
husband. Lake Placid was written by David E. Kelley (creator of Ally
McBeal and The Practice) in a campy, ludicrous but shamelessly
entertaining fashion. The croc hunt is merely an excuse to unite
Kelley's quirky characters in a unique situation. Yes, this film is
essentially a comedy with a premise that could be easily mistaken for
horror.
Nevertheless, a large portion of the budget has been dedicated to making
the monster look appropriately convincing. Creature effects Stan Winston
has created an excellent animatronic croc, and the computer generated
effects are, for the most part, largely impressive. Unfortunately, there
is a depressing lack of crocodile action to be found. The best scene
happens early on, when the beast attacks a helpless bear by slamming it
around like a sack of quivering potatoes. There are many brief scares,
but nothing entirely prolonged to hold your excitement for a period of
over four or five minutes. In a movie that clocks in at just under
ninety minutes, the thrills and chills are few and far between. Luckily,
Lake Placid does have a delightful sense of humor to at least compensate
for some of these shortcomings.
The cast tries hard to salvage the material. Fonda is originally fun,
but it soon becomes clear that Kelley is using her character as the
`woman in distress', and little more. She falls out of a boat about
eighteen times, and whines constantly to the dismay of the local law
enforcement. Pullman is earnest and charming, but carelessly wasted.
Chemistry between Kelly and Tom is flat and unconvincing from square
one, and their romantic interludes are too hollow to be relied upon on
such a regular basis. Needless to say, the movie belongs to two of the
supporting players. Irish actor Brendan Gleeson breaks through the
restrictions of his two-dimensional character and delivers an enjoyable
portrait of a distraught small town sheriff. And Oliver Platt continues
his string of authentic loons, playing an uninvited mythology professor
named Hector Cyr who regards crocodiles as treasured, `godly' creatures.
The insults exchanged between Hector and the sheriff are consistently
the best and funniest in the movie.
But somewhere, the fun expires. While Kelley's script delivers
unexpected laughs, it becomes unclear whether they are intentional or
lamely forced. And the actors can only do so much for the characters,
until their presence becomes meandering and pointless.
Of course, similarities to Jaws are obvious. How could you make an
underwater creature feature without avoiding them? Lake Placid is
ridiculously plotted, silly summertime entertainment for less demanding
viewers in need of bloody carnage. But folks, for a horror/comedy about
a lakeside man-eating crocodile, this ain't half bad.

Title
Review for Cruel Intentions (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
As a remake of the French play Les Liasons Dangereuses, Cruel Intentions
is a re-decorated and distinctly teen-orientated update that introduces
younger viewers to a familiar story. The lead roles, inhabited by Glenn
Close and John Malkovich in 1988's Dangerous Liasons, have been taken
over by good-looking representatives of the Gen-X acting crowd. And
despite the fact that Cruel Intentions may appear as a hackneyed and
laughably pretentious piece of work, it only exists to be good, trashy
fun. And that it is.
Judging by the amount of sarcasm displayed by one character, this film
could easily be labeled a dark comedy. It has shades of romance, but the
overall vibe a viewer would get from watching this is not necessarily a
pleasant one. This film is about revenge, deceit, and making people
miserable. Most of the treachery is committed by Katherine (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), a prep school president and (*ahem*) bitch
extraordinare. Katherine and her step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe)
have this sick game they play, in which they bet on which new and
unexpecting virgin they can seduce. But things get too easy for
Sebastian. He gets bored with the job rather quickly.
And so, he attempts to raise his standards. His new subject is a pretty
rich girl named Annette (Reese Witherspoon), who has vowed to remain a
virgin until she first experiences genuine love. Sebastian has high
optimism that he can sucker her in, and with a hot bet proposed that
puts his car against something even more desirable, he just can't afford
to lose. But on a second inspection, Annette turns out to be more
strong-willed than Sebastian anticipated. While trying desperately to
win her over, he begins to actually fall in love with the girl. His once
fool-proof plan has back-fired on him.
The first hour of Cruel Intentions is pure, devilish fun. Well-deserving
people are stabbed in the back, and we revel in all the mockery. It also
introduces a new, naive student named Cecile (Selma Blair), whom
director Roger Kumble uses for much of the comic relief. In one of the
film's more enlightening scenes, Katherine shows Cecile what it feels
like to `get to first base'. She then becomes an object of Sebastian's
desire, but with all her incessant whining and her immature attitude,
she just annoys him to death.
There is quite a bit of sexual content in this film, but most of it is
implied in very detailed conversations. Little is shown on-screen. In
the two lead roles, Phillippe and Gellar perform past our expectations,
each displaying a whimsical sense of self-confidence and sarcastic bite.
Gellar does such an impressive job with the malicious Katherine that I
began wishing she'd get hit by a semi, or some other large moving
vehicle that would kill her instantly. Reese Witherspoon shows us how
her undisputed charm can lighten up a movie even of this dark caliber.
Sooner or later, Cruel Intentions becomes drowned out in seriousness,
but the transition is well-staged. Phillippe and Witherspoon have
believable chemistry, mostly based on his frustration, and the romance
is harsh but believable. But, I did enjoy the first half with greater
viewing pleasure, because it was dastardly good fun. Bearing some
resemblance to Wild Things, Cruel Intentions has some obvious trashy
elements that are swept under the carpet in favor of plotting. Director
Kumble has successfully revised an old story to fit the demanding
standards of the 90's, but he has maintained the basic plot structure in
doing so. This film is cheap and offensive, but if it happens to catch
you in the right mood, you should indulge in this mindless garbage.

Title
Review for Jakob the Liar (1999)
The Holocaust. A caring soul trying to improve morale around him. And
certain comic undertones during a tragic time. All of these themes are
found in the Oscar-winning Foreign film Life is Beautiful, which put
gifted Italian clown Roberto Benigni in the American spotlight. Fresh
off the heels of Benigni's triumph, another film rolls into theaters
with very similar messages - and a big-name star to guide it.
The title character in Jakob the Liar is Jakob Heym (Robin Williams), a
Polish Jew living in a desolate ghetto in 1944. One night, Jakob hears a
radio transmission that could bring his fellow ghetto-dwellers some
hope: Russians are only 400 kilometers away, and the war could soon come
to an end. Jakob tries to contain his secret, but soon it has leaked out
and gotten terribly blown out of proportion by the other Jewish
residents. He sees that this one little news bulletin has substantially
lifted the group's spirit. And so, he begins to give them hope by
telling false stories about the approaching Russians. All of it is
basically hooey, but the suicide rate is down, and everyone seems to be
more optimistic about the future.
I might as well come out of the closet: I was that guy who liked Patch
Adams. Audiences sure did love the film, but it got some of the worst
critical reception of the year. With Jakob the Liar, moviegoers may be
turned off by the unappealing premise (not to mention the fact that the
subject has already been thoroughly explored). While full of mixed
messages and meaty flaws, this film does manage to balance itself quite
admirably - especially with all of the post-Life is Beautiful pressure.
The atmosphere, as envisioned by director Peter Kassovitz, is
successfully portrays the horror of the Holocaust in an effective and
subtle manner. It's too bad that often during the 2nd act, he doesn't
allow the audience room enough to appreciate all that.
Williams, in a well rounded and laid-back performance, manages to
contain his usual goofiness with style for virtually every minute of the
running time. The few moments in which he truly addresses his funny side
are shared with a 10-year old runaway Jewish girl named Lina (Hannah
Taylor-Gordon). Williams improvises a radio transmission with Winston
Churchill with restrained but hilarious success. The supporting cast,
full of veteran character actors, is easily one of the aspects to marvel
at in Jakob the Liar. Alan Arkin plays the pessimistic Frankfurter, Bob
Balaban is Jakob's timid friend Kowalsky, and Armin Mueller-Stahl is the
wise Professor Kirschbaum. While all of the actors are perfect in their
roles, the surprise stand-out is Liev Schreiber (Scream 2), who plays
the feisty boxer Mischa with spot-on accuracy.
At first, Jakob the Liar moves at such a blistering pace that it becomes
exceedingly difficult to properly accept the surroundings. The gritty,
unattractive look of the Polish ghetto makes it a substantial problem
for any comedy to work. But Kassovitz knows this, and his period dramedy
is certainly filled with more dramatic moments. This is not a Holocaust
comedy with a light touch. If that was the goal in mind, the environment
for Jakob and his companions would be much less bleak & somber and far
more warm & fuzzy. The mood finally starts working in the film's favor
toward the end, when the real issues are dealt with. During these
glorious moments, Kassovitz reaches a degree prosperity that rivals and
even surpasses a few of Benigni's achievements in his film.
Unfortunately, much of Jakob the Liar is too messy and undefined to
match the success of Life is Beautiful. Still, this determined piece of
work is highly respectable. And Williams will return to family comedy
this Christmas when he stars in Bicentennial Man. Hopefully, that
familiar formula will set the talented comedian back on track, with
audiences and critics alike.

Title
Review for Scream (1996)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Who thought the revival of the horror genre laid within this relatively
small-budget slasher film released in 1996? Scream surprised audiences
upon it's release, because not only did it succeed in delivering the
chills, it also had a delightful self-mocking sense of humor. Unknown
scribe Kevin Williamson added a much-needed dash of humor and cleverness
to his screenplay, making Scream quite the hot ticket for young
audiences.
After the renowned popularity of Williamson's pet project, numerous
clones began production. But none captured the shining quality of the
original Scream (except, perhaps, Scream 2). So what's Williamson's
secret? It's actually fairly simple. He doesn't create clichéd
characters; he makes his characters aware. They've seen all the horror
movies and know all the trademarks of the genre, and when they're
unwillingly placed in a situation themselves, they know how to handle
themselves (or at least, to a certain point). Scream is not some kind of
miraculous breakthrough, but it is a breath of fresh air.
The story takes place in a small, US town populated with teenagers who
look strangely like twenty-something Hollywood actors. Neve Campbell is
Sidney Prescott, a likeable senior who has dealt with the death of her
mother in the past year. Skeet Ulrich is her boyfriend, Billy, an avid
movie buff who sneaks through Sidney's window every now and again. But
he is no match for the dedication of cinema applied by Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), an intelligent geek who works at the local video store.
Then there is Matthew Lillard as the intolerable, gloating jerk Stew and
his fashion-smart girlfriend Tatum (Rose McGowan).
When their little town of Woodsboro is overtaken by a horrific double
murder, everyone is on the look-out. The killer himself wears an attire
of a spooky Halloween costume, and is now often referred to as `ghost
face'. Williamson's clever script relies heavily on the unmasking of the
murderer, and the motive for his (or her) killings. But before you go
off guessing the killer's identity, there are more suspects to address.
Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is at the scene of the crime, and
she and Sidney have shared a complicated past. Then, of course, there's
the charming local deputy Dewey (David Arquette), a well-meaning doofus
and also Tatum's older brother.
The brisk comedic moments in Scream are often more refreshing than the
horror. The best scenes both involve Randy spilling all the details he's
learned from years of watching scary movies. The first takes place in
the video store, where he loses his composure and screams out
`Everybody's a suspect!!!', to the confusion of other customers. The
second (and best) occurs when he explains the rules of horror movies to
friends at a party (Williamson even capitalized on the greatness of this
particular scene, and revised it to an equally amusing effect in Scream
2). In case you've forgotten these rules, here they are:
1) You can never drink or do drugs.
2) You can never have sex.
3)You can never, ever, under any circumstances say `I'll be right back'.
The final bloodbath in Scream is where I started to lose some interest.
It's too excessive, gory and a little far-fetched. Campbell shows off
her strong lungs nicely, Cox is dynamite fun playing the insatiable
bitch who wants a top story, and Arquette does unexpected marvels with
his character, who is relatively low on brain cells but shyly attempts
to hide his inadequacies. For director Wes Craven, this was definitely a
wise career move. But, the real star is Kevin Williamson, who has
written a screenplay that has revitalized the horror genre. Even as his
characters make the same mistakes as regular fright film victims do,
they are doing so with a knowing awareness. This translates into a lot
of fun.

Title
Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
There are far too many instances in modern cinema when a film with
wonderful promise fails to reach its full potential. It is frustrating
to see an opportunity for something fresh and exciting slip to the
elementary level of recycled formula. I was hoping `Galaxy Quest', a
film with a clever premise that begs for proper handling, wouldn't
suffer a similar fate. Luckily, this thoroughly entertaining `Star Trek'
homage has a few creative brain cells to spare, not to mention some
amusing perks for those craving sci-fi adventure.
`Star Trek' fans, be warned: you are being mocked in `Galaxy Quest'.
Actually, screenwriters Robert Gordon and David Howard show their basis
for inspiration in a rather loving manner, suggesting that this goofy
comedy is more of a playful homage to the Trekkies' universe. `Galaxy
Quest' is an ancient SF television program that has generated a rabid
cult following ever since its cancellation 18 years ago. But the
fan-gathering conventions still live on. Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who
played the Shatner-esque Commander Peter Quincy Taggart on the program,
relishes every minute of the glorified fame that has continued through
the years. Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub)
and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) - who all played crew members of the
spaceship `Protector' - are also grateful for the fortune `Galaxy Quest'
has bequeathed upon them, despite the fact that Nesmith is always given
the spotlight. But Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), who played the
extraterrestrial medical man Dr. Lazarus, regrets the fact he will
always be labeled as his `Galaxy Quest' character - refusing to ever
repeat the line Dr. Lazarus is famous for.
And now, insert the clever premise: at the latest convention, Nesmith is
confronted by a group of pale individuals whom he assumes are dressed
like aliens. They insist that he join them on an important mission to
stop an evil intergalactic tyrant. Nesmith, assuming this is just
another acting gig, persuades the remainder of the cast to tag along.
And then comes the real shocker: the aliens at the convention, called
Thermians, are actual aliens. They believe that the space-age adventures
of the `Protector' are detailed historical documents from planet Earth.
In a nutshell: the Thermians assume they are enlisting the help of
Commander Taggart and his experienced crew when, in fact, they are
nothing but an aging group of out-of-work actors. Clever, isn't it?
Luckily, Gordon and Howard are able to maintain the humorous vibe
generated by the initial premise. With its sci-fi humor, `Galaxy Quest'
isn't always on the mark, but the light-hearted daintiness of the
screenplay helps establish a feeling of enjoyable giddiness. It's the
sort of giddiness you get when something promising is going your way,
and the outcome is inevitable. The villain of the story, named Sarris,
is a menacing creature who appears to be the result of a crossbreeding
experiment between a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and a lobster. In a
hilarious scene, Nesmith (still unaware that the situation is not an
acting gig) talks casually to Sarris over an video intercept and (after
noting that the makeup effects look fantastic) orders the Thermians to
bomb the enemies' ship with `a lot of missiles'. In both its
affectionate nod to the `Star Trek' universe and its structural basis
for inventive humor, `Galaxy Quest' is funny and clever.
The light-hearted adventure behind the story proves to be enjoyable as
well, with Stan Winston creature effects and F/X work that is thoroughly
impressive for a comedy. Among the peculiar alien life-forms the crew
encounters are a swarm of vicious demon children and a towering
formation of stones that would best be described as a rock monster'.
The Thermians, on the other hand, are a race of peaceful beings caught
reluctantly in an intergalactic war. Their leader, the friendly Mathesar
(played with effective tenderness by Enrico Calantoni), is shocked by
the notion of anyone who offers misleading facts about themselves -
which could make it difficult for Nesmith and co. to reveal their actual
identities.
The human characters are well-played by the energetic cast. Former Tool
Man Allen hasn't had much luck with his previous ventures to the big
screen (I think `Jungle 2 Jungle' was the major cause of  suicide in
1997), but here his performance is perfect. Weaver looks terrific in a
blonde wig, Rickman shows a sophisticated knack for comic timing, and
Shalhoub has fun as the only crew member who doesn't seem awestruck by
the extraordinary predicament they are in. Even Sam Rockwell (who played
a garish inmate in `The Green Mile') reveals his lighter side, and even
steals a few scenes playing a guy who made a brief appearance before
being killed off in episode 81. For a comedy, `Galaxy Quest' is
unusually well-written and exceptionally well-conceived. Anyone
searching the galaxy for light-hearted fun - a `Star Trek' fan or not -
would be hard-pressed to do better.

Title
Review for Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999)
I'm a dedicated fan of writer Kevin Williamson's work. He always finds a
clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas
that stem from his inventive brain. With Teaching Mrs. Tingle, his
directorial debut, Williamson has reached the end of his rope. What used
to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here. The
components are all there, including an encouraging premise that all high
school students can relate to. But where are the thrills? The laughs?
Both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate
revenge. And what a shame that is.
I loved the Scream films - heck, I even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of
The Faculty. Kevin Williamson was the reason horror films were such a
big draw at the box office. Teaching Mrs. Tingle, a black comedy that
will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers, may put an end to
his reign. Or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time
perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties. I still
have my faith, but I fear the name of Kevin Williamson may soon be a
forgotten echo of the past.
The title character of his pet project is a vicious, uncaring History
teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by British actress Helen
Mirren. Mrs. Tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare: a
heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most
hard-working of her pupils. The principal (Michael McKean) is horrified
of her, and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members.
I enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of
her way. Mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this
distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink.
In other words, it's a poor substitute for Williamson's best work.
The plot is a big problem here. Material that could have been enjoyable
is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the
director. The likable Katie Holmes plays Leigh Ann, an over-achiever
hoping to get a college scholarship. But typical Mrs. Tingle says her
History project, which she worked on for countless hours, is laughable.
Later on while studying in the gymnasium, a classmate (Barry Watson)
offers her a photo-copied duplicate of Mrs. Tingle's final exam. Leigh
Ann's best friend (Marisa Coughlan) encourages her to use it. Alas, the
old hag herself finds the three scheming, and snatches the test, and
prepares to talk to the Principal in the morning.
In the morning... how convenient! The three students head to Mrs.
Tingle's house, attempting to set the facts straight and clear Leigh
Ann's name. Things get out of hand, and the teacher gets knocked
unconscious in a tussle. The plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get
some reasoning out of her. Of course, not everything goes entirely to
plan.
Besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach (Jeffrey
Tambor, horribly wasted), there is little by way of actual progress.
There is no urgency to the situation; little tension or laughs are
involved. The humor is completely inconsistent. After many of the jokes,
the theater was so silent I could have heard a fly sneeze. You continue
to await some momentum in the story, something that could possibly
revive the slow pace. A moment like that never arises. Williamson also
does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players,
including the talented McKean and Larry Sanders' vet Tambor. And the
beautiful Vivica A. Fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance
counselor, and then Williamson disposes of her character entirely. On
the plus side, Holmes and Coughlan are admirable (with the latter giving
a frighteningly believable exorcism impression), and Molly Ringwald has
an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher.
While everything is pretty lifeless, Teaching Mrs. Tingle remains
watchable. There are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again,
but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script.
Mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching. She is convincingly
evil and fun to watch, but even her gifted delivery can't save
individual scenes that flounder in boredom. If there is one word for the
movie surrounding her, it would be `disappointing'.
Basically, Kevin Williamson is his worst enemy here. His uneventful
direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated (not
that his writing here is especially good). We will see, when rookie
screenwriter Ehren Kruger writes the third installment in the Scream
franchise this Christmas, whether Williamson is for real.

Title
Review for Any Given Sunday (1999)
I can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of Oliver
Stone's `Any Given Sunday'. It's an entertaining movie that offers both
insight and excitement into the rock-em, sock-em profession of pro
football. Unfortunately, the director seems to have only one priority on
his mind: sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera
maneuvers. In altering each frame with quick-flash photography and
dizzying, in-your-face editing, Stone appears to have completely ignored
the matter of plausible character development and football politics. We
see glimpses of greatness, but `Any Given Sunday' has its agenda all
tangled in technical gobbledy-gook. It grows tiresome and monotonous.
Yes, Stone has pulled a Brian DePalma.
Matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go. Tony
D'Amato (Al Pacino), coach of the struggling Miami Sharks, finds his
team stuck in a losing rut. Aging Quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid)
appears to be losing his touch, and D'Amato can't seem to ignite any
passion in his squad. When Cap is injured on the field, and after a
patch of unlikely events occur, third-string QB Willie Beaman (Jamie
Foxx) is brought into the game. Once in the huddle (and this becomes an
in-game ritual), Beaman horks all over the field. Nerves, you see.
Eventually though, the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates,
sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements, the
music videos, etc. - and Stone straps us in for the jolting ride of
behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like.
And I believe it. There is some intriguing insight posed, but in the big
scheme of things, Stone fumbles the ball.
The problem with the director's visual approach is this: he uses
extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have
been appropriate. Football is an exciting game to watch, but Stone seems
to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only
add to the adrenaline rush. I guess he is mistaken. `Any Given Sunday'
is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor
more frequently than it excites them. Many football fans (including one
I attended with) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish'
way Stone has decided to present the game.
In return, a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the
director's tampering. In welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes
to a break, this actually shows decent character development and
interaction. For instance, heated returns between D'Amato and feisty
young owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) are enjoyable to watch.
There is also a solid performance from Jamie Foxx, who experiments with
great success in his first trek into dramatic territory. The stellar
supporting cast includes Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart, Lauren Holly,
Ann-Margret and Charlton Heston (in an extraordinarily brief
appearance). Unfortunately, too many big names are wasted - a typical
demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast.
Pacino makes some interesting progress with his character. You begin to
identify with coach D'Amato and the morals he is striving for.... but I
often felt he was just another play thing Stone could weave in and out
of his editing dynamics. `Any Given Sunday' is a watchable but
disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat
to excessive filmmaking technique. And a very distant back seat, at
that.

Title
Review for Grey Owl (1999)
Few movies I have seen are as naturally majestic and wondrous as the
true life story of Grey Owl. Perhaps it's the steady, artful direction
of Richard Attenborough. Or maybe it's the dedicated presence of Pierce
Brosnan in the title role. Whatever the reason, Grey Owl shows
absolutely no sign of false storytelling or Hollywood fakery. The film
glides gracefully from minute one, telling the passionate story of a
strong-minded man who fought the complications of modern society during
the 1930's. And, with both Grey Owl fanatics and those unfamiliar with
the legend, this true story is sure to hit home.
Just one wonderful thing about Grey Owl is how quickly and efficiently
Brosnan makes us forget about James Bond. As we all know, the actor is
just the latest debonair stud-muffin to fill 007's shoes (he'll soon be
appearing in his third Bond entry, The World is Not Enough). You never
even expect Brosnan to crack a witty comeback like we have come to
expect from his James Bond character. He looks dignified in long,
braided hair and a feather headdress - as if he and the surrounding
nature were always destined to interact.
Archie Grey Owl (full name - Archie Belaney) was really an Englishman
living out a childhood fantasy: to be a red Indian and live in the wild.
After traveling to Ontario to become a trapper and hunting guide,
Belaney meets a Mohawk named Pony (Annie Galipeau), who is working as a
waitress at a nearby lodge. With the help of a few adorable beaver kits,
Pony helps Archie find his true bearings, allowing him to get in touch
with his conservational side. Soon, Archie is the most famous red Indian
in the world, delivering public speeches to make people aware of the
nature that so many take for granted.
I'm unfamiliar with the story of Grey Owl, but after seeing the film,
I'm inclined to learn more about this great man. I know, however, that
the character of Belaney is not entirely explored in the film - but this
represents only a minor problem. Brosnan delivers what could be his
finest performance: he is reserved, naturally convincing and completely
effective as he handles the morals that the real Grey Owl stood so
strongly for. At first glance, the acting talents of Galipeau appear to
be very doubtful. But the flow of the story helps accentuate her natural
strengths, and gradually she begins lifting her share of the weight that
had once been so one-sided.
Attenborough also brings the finest details to life in Archie and Pony's
relationship. Grey Owl is no emotional powerhouse; it's success lies
within the fact that the environmental issues are covered so efficiently
without ever being thoughtlessly overblown. The wonderful cinematography
(by Roger Pratt) helps engross the viewer even more, as does the
sweeping photography of tranquil lakes and beautiful green forest. Any
Canadian nature or history buff is going to love what they find here.
Attenborough tries nothing fancy or gimmicky to help bring the legend to
life. Instead, he opts for the most natural presentation you could
possibly imagine. This is why Grey Owl succeeds as it does. This proves
that sometimes, even the most straightforward approach can be the most
effective. And, in the case of Archie Grey Owl, no special Hollywood
tampering is needed. Searching through my Thesaurus under the word
beautiful', I find these synonyms: alluring, artistic, attractive,
captivating. All of them could be used to describe Richard
Attenborough's Grey Owl.

Title
Review for Ravenous (1999)
Starring-Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy Davies,
Neal McDonough, David Arquette, Stephen Spinella and John Spencer
Director-Antonia Bird
Rated 18A
20th Century Fox
The tag-line for Ravenous is `You are who you eat', and that couldn't be
more accurate. The subject in this deranged and enjoyable horror/comedy
is cannibalism, so if you don't have a stomach that can withstand
graphic dismemberment's (which there are plenty of), I would advise you
to keep your distance. But, for those individuals with an acquired taste
for an original story with their carnage, this unique little bloodbath
could spell genuine fun.
The year is 1847, and the Mexican-American War is in full swing. Captain
Boyd (Guy Pearce) has been dispatched to the base of Fort Spencer.
There, he joins an interesting troupe of characters. The commanding
officer is Lieutenant Hart (Jeffrey Jones), who informs Boyd of his
duties at the Fort. Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) is a careless drunk,
Toffler (Jeremy Davies) is a dedicated man of God, Reich (Neal
McDonough) is a cocky soldier and Cleaves (David Arquette) is the
bumbling idiot of a chef. Fort Spencer is a desolate and uneventful
location, until a mysterious stranger arrives at the door, freezing and
suffering from malnutrition (ha!).
The strange drifter, who calls himself Colqhoun, is played by Robert
Carlyle. He describes to the group how he came to be in their presence.
You see, he was part of a six-person expedition when they became lost
and stranded by oncoming weather. After eating the oxen and horses, they
had to resort to something even more terrifying. Yep... cannibalism. Lt.
Hart opts to travel to where the group had taken shelter and look for
any survivors, but once there he discovers the real truth. Could it be
that Carlyle is not really who he seems....?
Ravenous basically tanked at the box office, a statistic that could have
been easily predicted. This movie is not for all tastes. Director
Antonia Bird has created a bizarre cocktail of black comedy and bloody
horror, and either aspect may possibly disgust the average viewer. In
it's inner workings, however, Ravenous is something truly interesting.
There is some great suspense and atmosphere at the film's core, backed
up by a wonderfully oddball musical score that combines bizarre
instrumental work with some genuine excitement. The script is also full
of amusing one-liners, usually spoken by the witty Carlyle and centering
around the pun of `eating people'. In fact, he even has an argument for
cannibalistic actions: `Winston Churchill once said Eat to live, don't
live to eat.' '
Which brings me to the cast. I had a minor problem in that most of the
supporting players were hideously stupid, but then again, each actor is
so convincing with a limited IQ. The stand-out here is easily Carlyle,
who many will recognize from The Full Monty (and soon as the new Bond
villain in The World is Not Enough). The actor perfectly rounds every
corner of his role, showing plenty of depth and craftsmanship, even as
he puffs contentedly on a cigar. Pearce plays a cowardly but
strong-minded character, much like his role in the excellent LA
Confidential, but he doesn't have as much success here. As the
protagonist, he shows hardly enough courage to be considered a hero,
even despite Boyd's typical spineless ways.
The first act of Ravenous is wonderfully staged, efficiently setting up
the domino's so that they can (hopefully) be knocked over with style
when the time comes. Alas, there are a few too many garish and
unpleasant twists as the movie nears the finish line, but not so much
that the film loses complete momentum. There are still the performances
and soundtrack to keep it churning - and that, surprisingly, seems to be
enough.
There is plenty of icky gore involved. If just the thought of
cannibalism makes you feel nauseous, then this movie is not for you. It
is what you would call `different', yes, but I also found it engagingly
offbeat and entertaining. If you're getting sick of the endless
repetition that Hollywood has to offer, try Ravenous on for size. It's a
scary, amusing - an overall bloody good time. Bring a napkin and dig
right in.

Title
Review for Three to Tango (1999)
When it comes to the cast members of `Friends' making the transition to
film, success is scarcely evident. Perhaps the most profitable move to
cinema was made by Courteney Cox (now Courteney Cox Arquette), who
experienced enormous prosperity with the renowned slasher films `Scream'
and `Scream 2'. Matthew Perry, although appealing and undeniably
charming, has received the short end of the stick in his ventures to the
big screen.
I enjoyed Perry's `Fools Rush In', but the film was generally savaged by
critics, leaving it in tattered box office ruins. And in the forgotten
comedy `Almost Heroes', the actor looked suitably embarrassed as he
played second fiddle to the late Chris Farley. The right vehicle was
waiting for Matthew Perry, but until he could work up the courage to
track it down, the comfy confines of `Friends' would have to suffice. Is
`Three to Tango' the crown jewel in Perry's bag of tarnished rocks?
Certainly not. But, with it's beguiling charm and infectious appeal,
this light romantic comedy is indeed a tasty entree.
Oscar Novak (Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are members of a
design team hoping to revitalize an aging city landmark with a new,
attractive layout. The project financier is a greedy millionaire named
Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott), who must choose between Novak and
Steinberg and an opposing design duo (played by John C. McGinley and Bob
Balaban). But first.... Charles' secretary overhears a conversation
between Oscar and Peter, and makes the inaccurate assumption that they
are gay partners. Charles gets immediate wind of this news, and, worried
about male competition, he hires Oscar to spy on his beautiful mistress
(Neve Campbell) at an art show.
As with most romantic comedies, the primary weakness in `Three to Tango'
is in it's setup. The characters are introduced in such a frenzied rush
that they come across devoid of depth and discernible feeling. The
situations are not particularly funny or interesting. But the mistaken
identity premise at the film's core provides more cheerful fun than one
would rightfully anticipate. There's nothing you won't be able to
predict, but director Damon Santestefano's approach is an inviting one,
and the continuous appeal of the actors generates enough fuzzy charm to
fill three movies of a similar genre.
Although the issues are interesting, the experience of `Three to Tango'
is not going to linger in your mind. It's pleasant, but instantly
forgettable. Oscar initially goes along with the false humor of his
homosexuality, in fear of letting the definitive moment of his career
slip carelessly through his fingers. But, when the news gets out in the
open, he is helpless to defend his strictly heterosexual intentions.
Borrowing tidbits from the amusing comedy `In and Out', in which Kevin
Kline was mistakenly `outed' at the Academy Awards, Oscar's friends and
family are left bewildered with the arrival of the shocking news. Amy,
Charles, onlookers on a city bus - everyone believes Oscar is gay. As
Platt puts it: `You've made a big gay bed, and now you must slumber
gayly in it.'
It's nice to see Neve Campbell free herself from the bloody (`Scream')
and the dirty (`Wild Things'), and attempt to portray nothing other than
good old-fashioned cute. Whenever Campbell lends her bright, attractive
charisma to a scene, `Three to Tango' sparkles with genuine appeal. The
relationship between Oscar and Amy is convincing, mainly because both
leads are charming and have the ability to balance the weight of the
relationship with precise believability. The sparks generated in their
unlikely romance are extremely hard to resist. And, in wonderful spirit,
Oliver Platt once again registers as a quirky supporting player. My
question is: when will his assembly line of quirky supporting characters
ever stop? There was `The Three Musketeers', `Lake Placid', and now this
primary example. One thing is for certain: Platt is good at what he
does.
`Three to Tango' is refreshingly full of honest, well-executed humor
that will strike a chord with most audience members. What's lacking is
the presence of a decent script that doesn't rely heavily on predictable
plot devices and underdeveloped characters. However, those characters
are played by actors with enormous charm - enough charm to guide this
light, enjoyable romantic comedy to moderate success.

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
In Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow', there is a mysterious Headless Horseman
who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name. He rides a
beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the
wound of his victims with an immediate swipe. Burton's update on
Washington Irving's classic tale of `The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' offers
us the mystery of the Horseman, when the screenplay should have merely
settled on the aspect of the horror. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker
(`Seven') throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of Sherlock Holmes, but
the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing, as Burton
offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and
stirring to examine.
As `Sleepy Hollow' opens, we're greeted with a juicy cameo from Martin
Landau, who won an Oscar in Burton's `Ed Wood'. Landau plays a prominent
citizen of Sleepy Hollow, who, on a fateful carriage ride through the
forest, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider. After two more
murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town, Constable Ichabod
Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent in to investigate. Landlord Baltus Von
Tassel (Michael Gambon) explains to Crane that the heads have been
severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case,
and that they believe the murderer is a dead Hessian trooper (played
briefly by a wonderfully jarring Christopher Walken) who has risen from
the grave after being decapitated in the Western Woods. Crane is not a
man of great superstition, and is determined to root out the human
culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets (things I was not
surprised to find in a Tim Burton movie).
First and foremost, `Sleepy Hollow' is a fun horror film. As with
virtually all Burton movies, we are treated to a wonderful score by
composer Danny Elfman, who has once again poured excitement and
imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic
mood perfectly. The Horseman F/X are stylish and impressive,
particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual
actors. But why did I enjoy `Sleepy Hollow' as much as I did? Although
enjoyable, it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore
that spurted left and right.. It was the light comic touch that Burton
applied. The film has the sweetness of a candy apple, usually channeled
through Depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek Ichabod Crane,
who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his
cowardly qualities.
This is certainly not the only alteration that's been made. As the film
progresses, it becomes apparent that Walker is more concerned with the
mystery of the murders than the murders themselves. The momentum is
slowed considerably once Crane begins piecing the mystery together,
because for the audience, it's not an issue we particularly wish to be
solved. It's more effective for the Headless Horseman to be an elusive
demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive. Still, we are still
captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and Burton's keen eye to
capture our attention. The costuming is exceptional, and the dialogue is
crisp and effective throughout (it's recognizable that the script was
refined by award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard).
The supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many. A
blonde Christina Ricci is in fine form as Von Tassel's daughter Katrina,
and an unlikely romance between she and Ichabod is surprisingly
consistent. Walken, Michael Gough (who appeared in Burton's `Batman'
films) and Miranda Richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their
separate roles. I suppose the strengths behind `Sleepy Hollow' lie
within the central trio: director Burton, Constable Depp and the
Headless Horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy.
All of this is not to be taken seriously, of course. `Sleepy Hollow' is
a lavish, frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale
that many people cherished as children. If you've got a decent head on
your shoulders, you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater
and enjoy it one last time.

Title
Review for Hanging Up (2000)
Disconnect the phone line. Don't accept the charges. Do anything you can
to avoid the wretched, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `Hanging Up'.
I figured I needed to get in touch with my feminine side, and `Hanging
Up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so. The film features an
incredible palate of female talent, and the capability behind the camera
brought to mind such sparkling gems as `Sleepless in Seattle' and
`Unsung Heroes'. Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow play a trio of
sisters who, once separated by career judgments over family ties, must
reunite when their father (Walter Matthau) is admitted into the hospital
with Alzheimer's disease. While this may read like an optimum
opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on
the past, the script by sisters Delia and Nora Ephron is exasperating,
shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery. `Hanging Up' has the
overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours, while you
don't have the option of doing as the title suggests.
For the first half-hour, the Ephron sisters use telephone conversations
for a basis of character development. This is an annoying and
ineffective device. Cell-phones ring every five minutes, and everyone
hurriedly rushes along, leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer
to relate to the sisters' issues and problems. If `Hanging Up' was an
apple pie, then I felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the
story. Granted, there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film.
But they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained
emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck.
The most outrageous strategy in `Hanging Up' is that, after a series of
largely unrealized attempts at character development, we are expected to
exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a
melodramatic finale. We are able to identify with Eve (Ryan), the most
open and caring daughter, because she is the one who stayed by her
father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending
career. Georgia (Keaton), the eldest daughter, is celebrating the fifth
year anniversary of her magazine called.... `Georgia'. Maddy (Kudrow),
the soap opera actress, spends time either contemplating her possible
path to stardom or nursing her dog. Ryan's convincing performance and
diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `Hanging
Up'. Kudrow, so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead Phoebe
in `Friends', is totally wasted. Ditto for Keaton, who is serving a
double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a
difficult priority juggle. Her frenzy is apparent.
For a chick flick, there is a distressing lack of chuckles. The reliable
Matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that, given his character's
situation, seems more depressing than amusing. Even so, the peak form of
humor in `Hanging Up' is represented by some of Matthau's nasty quips
and Ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a
pill. That about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel
during the film. My curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how
such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour.
But really, it's no mystery. The predictable, melodramatic filth that is
`Hanging Up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses. Pin it on
the screenplay, which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four
minutes, while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying
flurry of phone conversations. It's certainly a far cry from what one
would label as a rewarding experience, but `Hanging Up' should have at
least been enjoyable. Uh-uh. It's a wrong number from the beginning.

Title
Review for End of Days (1999)
The Austrian accent. The bulging biceps. The memorable punch-lines
uttered right before he empties an entire magazine into a swarm of
foolish villains. When it comes to pure action satisfaction, Arnold
Schwarzenegger is the man of the hour. The imposing star of such
blockbuster hits as `Terminator 2: Judgment Day', `Predator' and `True
Lies', Arnold has become a reliable synonym for the action genre. Of
course, when I say reliable', I'm not including such hazardous bombs as
`Jingle All the Way' and the downright humiliating `Batman and Robin'.
In fact, since the fourth sequel in that misbegotten action series,
Arnie has taken a leave of absence from the silver screen. Just in time
for the year 2000, the millennial thriller `End of Days' marks his
delayed return. Here, Schwarzenegger plays struggling ex-cop Jericho
Cane (sounds almost.... biblical), who finds himself in the midst of an
enormous Satanic dilemma as the new millennium approaches. When I say
Satanic, I mean Beelzebub himself - who has arrived in New York City to
search for a mortal bride, which will signal the birth of the
Anti-Christ and the end of all human existence. All of this must happen
in the final hour before the year 2000 - don't ask me why. Ask
screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe (`Air Force One'), who must have been
exposed to some mind-altering substance while penning this ridiculous
action film.
`End of Days' is a film written with remarkable stupidity. The plot is
tied messily together with absurd coincidences and dialogue that seems
to be extracted from out-takes of an Ernest movie. Many scenes border on
unintentional amusement, and a few shatter that barrier with ease. And
yet, there was a moment in `End of Days' when I just gave up on the
idiotic script and decided to embrace all of the Satanic shenanigans for
simple fun. This moment arrived when Jericho is greeted in his apartment
by an uninvited Lucifer, who has taken over the body of a Wall Street
banker in his attempt to hunt down the chosen bride. Inhabiting his new
body (which, coincidentally, is the wonderful Gabriel Byrne), Satan
tries to tempt Arnold with erasing a terrible memory from his past. It's
really a terrific scene, giving Byrne the chance to flash his demonic
charisma, and offering Satan a few snappy punch-lines (particularly when
he claims The Bible is merely an `overblown press kit').
This is Marlowe's one great scene of exchanging dialogue, and from
there, `End of Days' never looks back. Taking the ball is director Peter
Hyams, who knows how to frame a well-choreographed action sequence to
near perfection, and does so in a pair of extravagant scenes that
include all the usual Arnold ingredients: rapid gunfire, colossal
explosions and lots of physical exertion on the part of the star. The
stand-out is probably an impressively mounted and exciting chase on a
subway, in which Arnold protects Satan's bride-to-be (Robin Tunney) with
the man himself in hot pursuit. Frankly, I am sick and tired of hearing
all that crap about Hyams' tendency to be a hack'. The man cannot build
characters, and he rarely derives a solid performance out of an actor,
but his photography is stylish and his technical approach is often
effective. His last film, 1996's creature feature `The Relic', is quite
the possibly the most underrated monster movie in recent memory.
Here, Hyams once again teams with special effects guru Stan Winston (who
also did creature effects for `The Relic'). Unfortunately, although
somewhat nifty, a large portion of the CGI work in `End of Days' is
disappointing and choppy. The only truly effective moment is the final
showdown in an abandoned church, where Winston's creature effects are
put to the test. Arnold himself is not given much room to function with
the character of Jericho, although a few amusing one-liners help matters
immensely. Playing the wisecracking partner Chicago, Kevin Pollack is
used specifically for comic leftovers, but as always, he's a good fellow
to have around. The one true performance that warrants a second
examination is Gabriel Byrne's, who is smashing fun as Satan's human
transport.
I suppose `End of Days', although thoroughly mediocre, is somewhat fun
in the end. It's likely to impress Arnold fanatics and action buffs who
don't mind the gratuitous gore and insanely moronic screenplay. I
enjoyed certain aspects of it - like the scene where Jericho has the
living tar beaten out of him by a little old nanny (Mariam Margolyes),
which is embarrassing for Arnold despite the fact the nanny is a
superpowered minion of Satan.
The action was cool. A few of the performances were enjoyable. For a
Y2K-based thriller, `End of Days' could have been so much more
intelligent and explosive - the showdown of Arnold and Satan should have
been classic. As is, it's merely ridiculous, embarrassing fun.

Title
Review for Ready to Rumble (2000)
Starring-David Arquette, Scott Caan, Oliver Platt, Rose McGowan,
Diamond Dallas Page, Bill Goldberg, Joe Pantoliano and Martin Landau
Director-Brain Robbins
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Warner Brothers - 04/00
An 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch, wearing
tight-fitting leather, as she cheers on her favorite TV wrestler by
calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'. Two men messily eat fast food as
their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them. And roughly 17
people are booted in the crotch. Welcome to `Ready to Rumble'. Judging
from the fact that potty-mouth Adam Sandler is the reigning box-office
comedy champion, you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that
yes, there is an audience for this sort of thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I weep for society.
Mind you, when executed with style and comic ingenuity, jokes like an
alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel (`There's Something About
Mary') and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea (`Dumb and
Dumber') can be extremely funny. Unfortunately, `Ready to Rumble' is not
being helmed by the Farrelly brothers, nor is it bolstered by a script
that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or
inspired. `Ready to Rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of
professional wrestling.... which, in fact, sounded like a fine concept
for a goofball comedy.  But director Brian Robbins and screenwriter
Steven Brill handcuff themselves, and limited to a stampede of asinine,
humdrum bathroom humor, basically the only thing they manage is to evoke
memories of Pauly Shore and `Bio Dome'.
Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) take pride
in being hardcore WCW wrestling fanatics. By day, they transport raw
sewage. By night (particularly on Nitro' Monday), they pay homage to
their personal hero and savior - Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), the
undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community. With two
tickets to an upcoming Nitro performance, Gordie and Sean are psyched
about witnessing The King defend his title first-hand. But unscrupulous
boxing kingpin Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano, sporting long hair and
cowboy boots) has other plans. Sinclair is plotting to have Diamond
Dallas Page (playing himself) pummel The King into the tarp, thereby
dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a
bewildered auditorium full of fans. Gordie and Sean are shocked, rioting
madly while arguing `this isn't even a Pay-Per View event!!' They take
it upon themselves to track The King down and supply the encouragement
essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt. Along the
way, you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well.
You may find something to like in `Ready to Rumble' if a) you are a
rasslin' aficionado yourself, or b) you are a dedicated fan of the
lowest of low-brow comedies. I welcome low-brow humor with open arms -
that is, if its fresh and resourceful. `Rumble' is nothing but a sloppy,
frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation. The first
half-hour is the ultimate test of patience. Luckily, the simple-minded
events pick up steam, particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling
action. Director Robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and
excitement of football in `Varsity Blues', and when in the ring, he does
professional work. But the violence is too excessive. Having the fake
soap opera of WCW wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back
unfortunate memories of Owen Hart's tragic accident just last year,
especially with one character's dive during a cage match. This is not
something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of. Outside the wrestling
action, the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the
term scattershot', while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity
scale of 1 to 10, with Brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from
`diddly' to `boob' and so on. The final tally: I chuckled a few times,
groaned a lot, and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving Martin
Landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for
105.
Casting-wise, `Ready to Rumble' is an odd duck. Oliver Platt as a
champion wrestling figure? He's perhaps a bit chunky, but fellow
wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty', which
dampens the blow I suppose. Rose McGowan is fully disposable as a sultry
WCW cheerleader (`The Nirto-est of the Nitro girls,' proclaims Gordie),
but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers Goldberg, `Macho
Man' Randy Savage and Sting (among others). WCW fans are sure to
appreciate these. Others... well, won't. I found merit in David
Arquette's bountiful energy as Gordie, which brings me to my
finishing.... ahhh.... `praise' for the film: in `Ready to Rumble', I
have discovered something even more annoying than Arquette's `AT&T'
television commercials. Now there's a low blow for you.

Title
Review for Play It to the Bone (1999)
Starring-Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich,
Lucy Lui, Tom Sizemore, Robert Wagner and Richard Masur
Director-Ron Shelton
Canadian Rating-14A
We know Ron Shelton can do sports movies. He has a knack for capturing
the familiar ups and downs accompanied by professional athletics, from
baseball (`Bull Durham') to basketball
(`White Men Can't Jump') to golf (`Tin Cup'). With `Play it to the
Bone', Shelton has
tip-toed in boxing territory. Unfortunately, `Play It' is not a sports
movie - it's a road movie
about sports. This sets up an unnecessary obstacle course that Shelton
has difficulty in
overcoming, and the audience is short-changed with predictability in the
process.
Right down to the bare details, `Play it to the Bone' is a guy movie. We
open in Las Vegas,
where the undercard match for the upcoming Mike Tyson fight has just hit
a patch of trouble.
One of the boxers is dead, and the other is doped up in a hotel room,
surrounded by half-naked
prostitutes. Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore) needs two new fighters, and fast.
So he decides to
recruit a pair of washed-up boxing buddies named Vince Boudreau (Woody
Harrelson) and
Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas). As best friends, it's an awkward
position for Vince and Cesar to be duking it out in the ring, but a
handsome $100,000 purse aids in the decision
process. Within a few hours, the two chums are traveling the road to
Vegas, with juggled
girlfriend Grace (Lolita Davidovich) behind the wheel. `Play it to the
Bone' actually doesn't
venture into boxing until the final blood-soaked bout between Vince and
Cesar. Until then, it's a road movie, in which we admire the attractive
Nevada desert scenery and marvel at the
inconsistent attempts at solid character development. Shelton's
screenplay is obvious and
derivative, but to his credit, the story moves at a relatively
harmonious pace and the viewer's
attention never strays too far.
During their trek to Vegas, we are obviously intended to learn important
details about the
characters of Vince and Cesar. The extent of Shelton's personality
navigation leads us to the
realization that Cesar once experimented with homosexuality after a
humiliating match in
Vegas, and that Vince regularly sees Jesus. Great, huh? To add a little
dash of spice, Shelton
adds the character of Lia (Lucy Lui), a confused sex kitten who joins
the car pool when she
offers to buy gas and waffles. Although it's occasionally quite funny,
it's safe to say that `Play
it to the Bone' has its priorities in a tangle. The final boxing tussle
between the two friends is a
bloody, merciless war of well-choreographed cuts and jabs. Grace, who
runs from corner to
corner to offer advice and encouragement, can't bear to watch as the
bone-crunching battle
continues through several rounds. She has the same problem as the
audience: knowing both the fighters, she doesn't want either to lose.
The big scuffle, though exciting, is an awkward
predicament for everyone involved, and Shelton doesn't pull the right
punches to emerge
unscathed.
Harrelson and Banderas do fine jobs. I was particularly impressed with
Antonio, who is
displaying more range and versatility than his sullen `Desperado' days.
Both actors look very
convincing in the ring. With Grace, Lolita Davidovich creates an
interesting character. She
offers some feminine stability to separate the testosterone-driven Vince
and Cesar, and most of the time it works. Sadly, like many things in the
movie, her character is little more than an
elaborate cliché. While he totally explored the sport of baseball in
`Bull Durham' (possibly his
best), Shelton does little more than scratch the surface of boxing.
There is urgency lacking in
his approach, and even by simple guy-movie standards, there is something
missing. One thing
that is guaranteed - a Ron Shelton trademark - are a few raunchy moments
sprinkled here and
there.
Go with a group of your guy buddies, and you may enjoy this predictable
Shelton offering. But
overall, `Play it to the Bone' misses the knock-out. It merely circles,
looking for an opportunity
to strike that never quite arises.

Review for Big Daddy (1999)
Starring-Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams,
Jon Stewart, Leslie Mann and Kristy Swanson
Director-Dennis Dugan
Rated PG
Although the picture of Adam Sandler raising a child is a frightening
thought, he is acting as a father figure in his newest comedy. Big Daddy
gives us an impression of what the spawn of Sandler may appear as, and
the result is much sweeter than suspected.
As his newest character, Sandler plays an incomparable slob named Sonny
Koufax, a law-school graduate who works one day a week at a toll booth
and spends the other six on the couch. That's when a five-year old
problem walks up to his door, in the form of a child who claims to be
his roommate's long-lost son. Unfortunately, the lucky father (Jon
Stewart) is on his way to China for a business trip. Sonny, for reasons
unknown at the time, takes the kid into open arms and decides to give
him a dose of the real world.
Young Julian is played by the tag-team acting duo of Cole and Dylan
Sprouse, two irresistibly cute twins who show a minimal stretch in
acting talents, but constitute perfectly for the demands of the role.
Sonny gives Julian a taste of his regular afternoon schedule, which
consists of going to the park and watching the roller bladers tumble to
their doom. Of course, the two lonely souls become attached to each
other, and Sonny begins to raise the little demon as his own.
But Sonny insists on teaching Julian the basics of  being a proper,
well-mannered young lad. He shows him that any and all spills can be
soaked up by a well-placed sheet of newspaper. He instructs him to dent
their cans of Alpha-Getti at the supermarket so that they can get the
discount price. He gives him a handy-dandy slingshot and a bag full of
marbles to slaughter innocent pigeons on the back deck. But despite the
fact that Sonny is offering Julian a completely misguided view on
growing up, it's obvious that he cares about the kid. And Sandler, the
king of naughty toilet humor, appears to be showcasing some charm here,
much the way he did in The Wedding Singer. Big Daddy does have a wider
range than something like The Waterboy, which appealed to only 13-25
year-old males in dire need of physical humor. But don't misread, this
is not his Truman Show. Big Daddy has the regular quotient of pee-pee
jokes and Sandler-orientated vulgarity, only toned down with sprinkles
of sweetness carefully mixed into the solution.
And he never did have a better chance of getting the girl either. There
are three respectable leading ladies in Big Daddy. Kristy Swanson plays
Sonny's original girlfriend Vanessa, until she runs off with a man twice
her age (or `Old Man River' as Sonny so eloquently puts it). Leslie Mann
plays Jon Stewart's stressed out fiancee, who is unable to socialize
because she once worked as a waitress at Hooters restaurant. The most
shimmering performance of all comes from Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy)
as Mann's sister Layla, who falls head over heels for Sonny. Well,
mostly because of the cute child he's dragging around.
Big Daddy has plenty of funny moments; no gargantuan laughs, but a few
dozen hearty chuckles spaced evenly throughout. The finale in a
courtroom is played too seriously, and the premise gets drowned in
sentimental goo as it goes along, but the result is still rather
charming and entertaining. Adam Sandler movies are not intended to be
art. They exist to give people a good laugh, and Big Daddy manages just
fine.
It's also nice to see a jump in maturity for Sandler and company here,
even if it's just a marginal one. There are still bizarre supporting
characters, but no one truly annoying. Rob Schneider is funny as an
illiterate delivery man, as is Steve Buscemi in a small role as an Egg
McMuffin craving homeless man. Watch for some of Sandler's Waterboy
co-stars to appear as a few of his business partners and beer-guzzling
friends. But sorry, no Farmer Frau.
It's commendable of Adam Sandler to be attempting a change of pace. But,
fans of the big goof aren't going to be disappointed with Big Daddy.
Perhaps Sandler isn't so much an embarrassment to Hollywood as he is a
savior to the movie-going public. I feel I'm ready to finally accept the
comedian for what he is. And after this makes 200 million at the box
office, I'd bet your money on more projects to come.

Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
As a late summer action/adventure entry, The 13th Warrior didn't look
promising. The production was delayed, reshoots were rumored, and the
film sat on the shelf for many months. There was also a feud between
director John McTiernan and author Michael Chricton, and the title was
changed from Eaters of the Dead (the original name of Chricton's novel)
to The 13th Warrior. Despite all of the apparent problems, the finished
product is a rousing sword-play epic with impressive battle sequences
off-setting some laughable dialogue and a non-existent plot.
Antonio Banderas was the hero of last summer's The Mask of Zorro, and
here he attempts to duplicate his success. Banderas plays an Arab
ambassador named Ahmed Ibn Fadlan, who is sent out to learn the ways of
the Vikings. He stumbles into their society in just the nick of time. A
messenger arrives, informing the warriors that his people have requested
their help in fending off a group of oncoming attackers. But these
attackers are not human. They are the Wendol - half-man, half-bear
savages who carry torches and destroy everything in their path. A
thirteen man defense team is dispatched, and Fadlan unwillingly becomes
one of the warriors on the dangerous mission.
What I've described is essentially the entire plot of The 13th Warrior.
What remains is a series of spectacular (and very gory) combat battles,
in which the Vikings attempt to defend neighboring tribes from the group
of beasts who decapitate their victims in very messy ways. Don't be
deceived when this gets off to a terribly rocky start. When McTiernan
brings out the big guns (so to speak), everything becomes easier to
swallow. The battle scenes are well-edited, consistently exciting, and
always accompanied by the marvelous score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The
intellectual aspects of the film are poorly handled, but the technical
credits and gorgeous landscapes practically clear your mind of any prior
ugliness in the script.
The are many problems in that area. When first accompanying the Vikings,
Fadlan learns their language by simply `watching them talk' (yeah,
sure....) There are plenty of these moments that you could speculate
about, or you could simply enjoy all of the bloody combat and beheadings
for what they are: a fun time at the movies. McTiernan also manages to
turn a weak script into a sumptuous epic, creating a believable
situation efficiently enough so that we don't ask any questions. Don't
look for The 13th Warrior to be among the nominees for Best Adapted
Screenplay award at next year's Oscars; the action scenes and impressive
sword tactics are the real show here.
Another thing I liked was the surprising range of the supporting cast.
You may think the other 12 Viking warriors would be dismissed as window
dressing, with lines like `Kill them all!' popping up occasionally. A
few of these characters actually show some depth; among them is Herger
(Dennis Storhoi), who cracks some amusing jokes and calls Fadlan `little
brother'. And then there's the Viking leader (Vladimir Kulich), who
displays more personality traits than his character limitations could
have allowed, even if he still is basically a big lug. Omar Sharif is
welcome as Fadlan's translator and guide when he first encounters the
Vikings, with a few brief but memorable early moments on screen.
The summer of 1999 hasn't been a memorable one, at least in the movie
department. The 13th Warrior is an exhilarating little adventure that
has more quality than you might expect, even with a pea-brained plot and
individual scenes of ridiculousness. For action fans craving some
carnage that the season failed to present, this one may just hit the
spot.

Title
Review for Random Hearts (1999)
Random Hearts is a frustrating experience, because the initial premise
behind it is more than interesting enough to warrant two hours of
thought-provoking material. Unfortunately, due to a mishandled approach
by director Sydney Pollack and an elementary screenplay by Kurt Luedtke,
the film becomes a tedious exercise in unlikely romance. Despite a few
exceptional features to note, Random Hearts is a needlessly drawn-out
and altogether painful experience.
The set-up of Random Hearts is absorbing, enticing the viewer with just
the right dosage of intrigue and suspense. Pollack introduces us to the
main characters with natural ease, and although during the first twenty
minutes his palette is full of meaty plot details, he handles everything
with refreshing efficiency. We meet Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison
Ford), a Washington DC police officer in the Internal Affairs division,
and Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas), a congresswoman in the wake of
running for office. What do these two unlikely souls have in common?
Well, their spouses are having a secret affair, and both are about to
slip away for a romantic getaway in Miami.
The flight that Mrs. Van Den Broeck and Mr. Chandler are on crashes.
This tragedy is unbeknownst to Dutch and Kay, who were informed of a
different destination. After a detailed investigation, Dutch realizes
that his wife was not off at a catalogue shoot as she had led on. One
discovery leads to another, and soon he ascertains that she was on the
flight, and seated next to a male companion (Mr. Chandler, of course).
Confronting Kay with this evidence, Dutch insists on learning how the
affair began. The congresswoman, however, doesn't want to have her
reputation scarred by these accusations involving her husband.
Random Hearts is about finding love during a time of great loss. We know
with certainty that Dutch and Kay are going to hit it off, despite their
awkward position. That's no surprise. What is a glaring surprise is that
their romance is poorly structured, rushed and completely unconvincing.
The single moment in which the film loses it's balance completely occurs
when Dutch and Kay hop into a car, and, after a few brief seconds of
vented anger, begin to suck each other's faces like two lovesick octopi.
All believability is immediately discarded in favor of staging an
implausible romance. The audience is supposed to relate, but they rarely
do.
The 2nd act of this hapless production is filled with ludicrous dialogue
and sloppy romantic exchanges. You have to look very deep into the
characters of Dutch and Kay to find any affable reason or remorse that
would normally revolve around the situation. Ford does some solid work
here, but sadly, important details of Dutch's personal life are left
untouched. It's difficult to show even remote interest in him. Scott
Thomas' character resembles an unfeeling piece of plastic, until Kay
finally begins to come around and reveal a discernible personality. The
stars try and try willingly to save Random Hearts from the black hole it
seems destined for, but have little success. In supporting roles,
Charles S. Dutton and Dennis Haysbeart are reliable, but neither is used
often enough to register.
During a few crucial moments in Random Hearts, I felt as if I would slip
into a coma. Pollack meanders endlessly around the central issues of the
script, managing to keep the viewer at an arm's length throughout. This
creates a difficult task: how do you become engaged in the story when
the director prohibits it? The film, which clocks in at a lengthy 2
hours, 20 minutes, could have been shortened by a healthy half-hour.
I enjoyed bits and pieces of the romance, including a surprisingly
genuine ending that felt much sunnier than most of the garbage that
preceeded it. I only wish Random Hearts would have been a different,
more intelligent and involving movie. Dedicated romantics may find
something to like here - but most, I'm afraid, will be exiting the
theater in random disgust.

Review for Drowning Mona (2000)
Starring-Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Neve Campbell,
Jamie Lee Curtis, Casey Affleck and William Fichtner
Director-Nick Gomez
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Destination Films - 03/00
`Drowning Mona', an oddball black comedy cocooned inside of a murder
mystery, is the second star-laden comedy feature to be released this
week. The first was `What Planet Are You From?', a ribald alien sex
farce with Garry Shandling and a barrel of humming genitalia jokes. Both
movies fail to reach the initial promise indicated by their hilarious
cast and premise, but one of those two components still buoys the bubbly
`Drowning Mona' to a docile altitude that makes it difficult to dislike.
First off, let's discuss the premise. A `horrible tragedy' has
blindsided the denizens of Verplanck, New York - a small town labeled as
the `Yugo capital of the world'. Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), possibly
the most reprehensible woman to ever live, has driven her Yugo off a
cliffside and drowned in the Hudson River. Upon closer inspection, it
appears that Mona's brake-line was tampered with and her fateful plunge
into the water was no accidental incident. But everyone in town is a
suspect, because even Mona's closest relatives thought she was a
miserable wench.
I know. It sounds pretty grim. But then there's the real fundamental
element of `Drowning Mona': the cast, which foams relentlessly with
comic talent and adds a cheery loft of innocent gullibility to the shady
proceedings. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) and daughter Ellen
(Neve Campbell) are among the only mentally competent residents in town
- save for Ellen's sweety-pie fiancee Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck).
William Fichtner (`Go') is Mona's careless husband Phil, who is having a
secretive affair with Rona the waitress (Jamie Lee Curtis), while
one-handed son Jeff (newcomer Marcus Thomas) ceaselessly pesters Bobby
about their mutual landscaping business. Rounding out the cast of
blithering idiots are Deputy Feege (Peter Dobson) and Cubby (Will
Ferrell), the sex-crazed funeral director. While you may believe the
film has its bearings set on a scathing black comedy, the strangely
innocent appeal of the multi-talented cast dilutes the darkened formula
while emitting a sunny charm. Resistance of succumbing to the saccharine
sweetness of `Drowning Mona' is futile.
There is plenty of frustration and lost chances afoot as well. As
written by Peter Steinfeld, `Drowning Mona' has its share of lame,
unfunny comic tedium. There's even a scene in which we are intended to
feel sympathy for the Mona, which generates an awkward and cumbersome
sensation of guilt for the viewer. Steinfeld's script could have
certainly used some `There's Something About Mary'-esque edge and a dash
more of maniacal energy, but the film still has its moments. Like air
pockets of hilarity across a deserted terrain, these wry little
instances of clever humor maintain the giddy playfulness of `Drowning
Mona'. It wasn't funny half the time, but I was still chuckling
throughout. Just pin this guilty pleasure on the diverse cast, who -
from the outrageously brash Midler to the jubilantly nonchalant Fichtner
- are white trash in top-form.
Director Nick Gomez shoots the film much like a smaller, independent
feature - not surprising, given that is his regular field. This approach
is effective, although it lacks the pizzazz to carry a comic ensemble
piece of this caliber overall. Another saving grace is Steinfeld's use
of well-distributed punchlines. For instance, when the police have just
informed Jeff that his mother has driven off a cliff while driving his
car, his immediate response is `What was she doing with my car?' In a
zany, off-kilter sort of way, this type of subtle lunacy is what keeps
the leaky foundation of `Drowning Mona' afloat. It's not the intriguing
murder-mystery portion or the zestful tidbits of black comedy... the
charming little touches help thread this film together. It's interesting
that, in the midst of a puzzling homicide and other gruesome
developments, all you can remember is that a character uses `Wheel of
Fortune' as foreplay, and another puts ketchup on pickles. That's
`Drowning Mona' for you.

Review for Blue Streak (1999)
Blue Streak, while not to be mistaken for a cinematic masterpiece, is a
moderately amusing diversion. It circulates around a familiar
fish-out-of-water plot, has the regular cardboard characters, and never
does anything special with the formula. But energetic star Martin
Lawrence is fun to watch, and although a large portion of Blue Streak is
messy and poorly assembled, it's sure to be an audience favorite. You
could call it Rush Hour's little brother (without Jackie Chan, of
course).
The film starts on a high note. Miles Logan (Lawrence) and his burglary
team are in the process of pulling off the heist of a priceless diamond.
Due to certain complications, the plan goes awry, and the vicious Deacon
(Peter Greene) double-crosses Logan for a bigger share of the profits.
Miles is able to escape the surrounding police and enter a separate
building, where he tapes the diamond to the interior of a ventilation
shaft for safe keeping. It's off to jail for Logan and his associates,
but after his short term is over, Miles knows he's going to be a very
wealthy man.
Two years later, as we are informed, he is out of the slammer and
looking for redemption. He ventures over to the location of his
priceless rock, only to realize that (*gasp*) it has become a police
station!! Dressed as a nerdy pizza delivery boy with massive incisors,
Logan is denied entry, and informed that the only ones permitted are
those `wearing hand-cuffs or a badge'. Luckily, Logan has connections,
and is able to get his hands on a fake ID that will enable him to enter
the station and retrieve his stolen goods. It all sounds so very
easy.....
Logan's new partner, Carlson (Luke Wilson), is a bumbling idiot who can
hardly drive. Then again, everyone in the police force must have a very
unflattering IQ to actually believe that Lawrence is indeed a dedicated
cop, despite the fact he has no past records on file. These people are
so stupid that they actually promote the impostor to lead detective in
the burglary division. They call him a `super cop', even though he
hasn't a clue what a P-31 is. And naturally, Logan continues to dig
himself deeper into the unbelievable mess while attempting to locate his
diamond.
Blue Streak never breaks formula, but it delivers the goods in a
reasonable fashion. The situation develops nicely and often blends
seamlessly to the audience's liking. The comedy is inconsistent, to say
the least, but when director Les Mayfield (Flubber) is on target, there
are some fireworks. In the supporting category, Peter Greene is
completely under-used in the psychotic bad guy role, and motor-mouth
David Chappelle has the effect of fingernails across a blackboard. Only
Wilson and William Forsythe, as another hard-nosed cop, register
alongside the star.
Which brings us to Martin Lawrence, who injects energy into the plot
like bursts of Ritlin. If you hate Lawrence and everything he does, do
not even consider seeing Blue Streak. It is a Martin Lawrence movie,
where everyone else plays second fiddle. But if you have a special place
in your heart for the comic and enjoy his goofy shtick, you are going to
have a lot of fun. The star is enthusiastic and likable, and rarely
shows signs of desperation even with the occasionally weak material.
There is also a healthy dose of action, well choreographed by Mayfield
and the remaining technical team. In-between gags there are breathless
car-chases, all of which exist for the purpose of making us forget the
mediocre plot and dialogue. Do they succeed? It all depends on whether
you enjoy this kind of thing. I was diverted enough by Lawrence's
abounding energy that I dismissed the gaping plot holes, sat back, and
had some fun. Despite all of it's flaws and an unsatisfying wrap-up,
Blue Streak never loses the ability to entertain.

Title
Review for Christmas Vacation (1989)
The third installment in the National Lampoon `Vacation' series is
entitled `Christmas Vacation', even though for this outing the Griswolds
do not actually go anywhere. They stay at home during the Holidays to
welcome a large gathering of family members in a reunion patriarch Clark
(Chevy Chase) has been carefully organizing. Clark knows, when everyone
arrives for Christmas, that idiotic feuding will commence around the
Griswold household. But, he has confidence he can maintain sanity and
still manage to host a memorable Christmas for everyone. Or so he
thinks.
In my opinion, `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is the best and
funniest of the series. I say this, of course, without proper knowledge
of what `European Vacation' is like (although I'm told it sucks, so I
think I'm safe). This film captures the humor and outlandish situations
of the clumsy Clark Griswold with far better success than the
sporadically amusing `Vacation' and the positively dreadful `Vegas
Vacation', offering a consistent slew of belly laughs and Kodak moments
galore. It works as a comedy, with shades of both physical humor and
genial sweetness, but if also functions as a memorable holiday feature.
In some slapstick-driven sort of way, it captures the essence of
Christmas - coming off as both charming and hilarious in simultaneous
fashion.
The troupe of disgruntled family members that arrive at the Griswold
household represent that basis for a lot of funny gags, many of which
are actually inspired. After the hazardous task of picking the proper
tree, Clark and Helen (Beverly D'Angelo) welcome both sets of parents to
their domain. His, played by Diane Ladd and John Randolph, are the
typical set of meek but encouraging well-wishers. Hers, played by Doris
Roberts and the late E.G. Marshall, are more of the pushy type. Director
Jeremiah S. Chechik stages this deranged family get-together with
inspired comic timing, recreating the possible scenario with a great
deal of humorous success The characters are broad but thoroughly
amusing, and some of the comic situations are simply irresistible -
especially the lighting ceremony (in which Clark attempts to show off
the extensive Christmas light display on the house) and the runaway
squirrel sequence.
There is something about `Christmas Vacation' that keeps me coming back;
an unusual spark that never seems to die off. Perhaps the spark is
ignited by Randy Quaid, who joins in the festivities as the grotesque
slob cousin Eddie, a family man who owns a scrappy RV and a dog
appropriately named Snot. Quaid, reprising the role from the original
`Vacation', seems ready and willing to turn Cousin Eddy into the most
utterly reprehensible - not to mention the most downright hilarious -
member of anyone's family in recent memory. When he is explaining why
the metal plate in his head had to be replaced, a sample bit of dialogue
includes `every time the wife would turn on the microwave, I'd piss my
pants and forget who I was for half-an-hour.' I don't know why, but each
time I find Quaid simply uproarious, and marvel at how his timing
derives some great deadpan humor out of Chase - who submits what could
be his funniest screen performance. The comic spark behind Chevy's
approach is certainly lit, and he even offers a believable mental
breakdown toward the end of the film, when (SPOILER AHEAD) Clark opens
his much anticipated Christmas bonus to find he's been enrolled in a
jelly club.
Some of the shtick really don't work - namely, the constant misfortune
of the snotty neighbors (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas
Guest). As he wrote the screenplay, there is also plenty of trademark
John Hughes humor (Clark gets repeatedly smacked with boards in the
attic, etc.). And yet, despite all of it's imperfections, I still find
`Christmas Vacation' to be a delightful holiday treat -a
chocolate-covered morsel of Yuletide comedy that seems to bring out the
best in the season. Some people view this film as a holiday classic,
ranking alongside `It's a Wonderful Life' and `Miracle on 34th Street'.
But I wouldn't extend my positive critique quite that far. `Christmas
Vacation' is something of a guilty pleasure - a guilty pleasure that I
partake in each and every year.

Title
Review for Knock Off (1998)
Once upon a time Jean-Claude Van Damme was a decent action hero. The
Muscles from Brussels bursted into the Hollywood market with mindless
adventure films, boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability. Some of
these excursions were fun. But now it seems like watching a Van Damme
movie has become a painful chore, with no rewards but the virtually
guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action. And when the action goes
sour, what is there left to enjoy?
I'll explain. Knock Off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen
working out of an office in Hong Kong. Marcus Ray (Van Damme), a
babe-magnet and stylish dresser, heads up the company with an annoying
weasel of a partner (Rob Schneider). They become part of a plot
involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans, seemingly by a mole
in the business. I'm going to reveal about everything in the next
paragraph, so if you want a review devoid of spoilers, skip onto the
next one. I'm not quite sure who gives a crap, but I'll issue a warning
anyhow.
Tommy is really working with the CIA. His boss (a very hammy and flat
Paul Sorvino) is the mole, and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny
but immensely powerful super weapons. He even stoops so low to put them
into children's toys. If you thought this plot outline sounded
intriguing, then you probably will enjoy Knock Off. If you think that
this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time
without causing you to roll over laughing, this might not be your cup of
tea.
Knock Off sucks. It stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals
could only conjure up in horrific nightmares. It amazes me how far these
producers will go to sell something, simply because Van Damme is the
star. The plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action
sequences that will baffle your mind, the performances are so wooden you
could use them to row a canoe, and the action itself is an absolute
catastrophe. Director Tsui Hark (who teamed with Van Damme in the
superior, but still lame-brained Double Team) is at the helm, and he
would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than
engage us with the plot. I suppose I enjoyed some of the camera work,
but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous. The
picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence, speeds are altered
consistently, and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun
barrels as the weapons are fired. It all sounds very cool. Trust me, it
isn't.
As much as it scars me to say this (har, har), Van Damme is terrible.
Sure, he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates
with the greatest of ease. He looks like he's doing a bad impersonation
of Jackie Chan, and his performance is stiff and tired. I hate to say
it, but perhaps it's time for Mr. Van Damme to give up his day job.
It's really a test of endurance watching Knock Off. I suppose there's
some enjoyment derived from Schneider's character, who is extremely
annoying, but provides the film's better moments. And what is the
beautiful Lela Rochon doing in this movie? Hopefully she grabbed her
paycheck and then fled the premises like an Olympic sprinter. Knock Off
doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film,
like a handful of Van Damme's others. No, this movie is an embarrassment
to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking. And considering how low
Hollywood has stooped as of late in that department, that is certainly
not saying much.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
STAR WARS: Episode I - THE PHANTOM MENACE Review
For more MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton, visit:
http://welcome.to/movieviews
With all the hype that Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace has been
receiving, it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the
film. The movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever, with
a marketing campaign so strong it has brought Colonel Sanders, the Taco
Bell Chihuahua and Pizza Hut together. Can George Lucas succeed yet
again with transporting us back a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away....?
YES. This Star Wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch, with
amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity. But that doesn't
mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment. The Phantom
Menace features the most eye-catching, jaw-dropping visual look in
cinematic history. The tremendous action sequences will have you
clinging to your arm rest, and the special effects are nothing short of
the best (and most plentiful) to ever be caught on film.
The vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this
project is astounding. The Phantom Menace is a delectable feast for the
senses, even if it has some disappointing aspects.
After we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky, with John
Williams' thundering score, we meet Qui-Gon Jonn (Liam Neeson) and young
Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), a Jedi master and his trainee `Padawan'.
They are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil
Trade Federation, and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the
taxation of trade routes to the planet of Naboo.
Oh, but enough about that. The prime concern for this prequel is
introducing young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) into the picture. As you
already know, this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon
become Darth Vader.
A spectacular Pod Race comes soon hereafter. This particular race is the
most exciting, energetic, high-octane action sequence that you'll ever
see. One of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of
strange alien creatures that Lucas has devised, and The Phantom Menace
is no exception. I loved Sebulba, the rat-like scoundrel whom Anakin has
to face in the Pod Race, and Boss Nass, the leader of the Gungans (who
are a neighbouring species to Naboo). One character who has been subject
to criticism is Jar-Jar Binks, a member of the Gungan race. Jar-Jar
speaks like Roger Rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug, and is there for the
sole purpose of supplying comic relief. Yes, he is initially annoying,
but I can admit to laughing over some of his harmless, goofy antics.
There is some lack of dramatic pull in this Star Wars entry, but the
presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses. The
final light-saber battle, between the Jedi's and the horrific (and
terminally underused) villain Darth Maul, is spectacular to behold.
Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, C-3PO and R2-D2 have cameo appearances.
 Lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience, even if his latest
shows obvious signs of tiredness. One can only wonder what the possible
technology will present for the next two installments, Episode's I and
II. When they arrive, you'll know where to find me.

Review for Magnolia (1999)
Starring-Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Baker Hall,
John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and Melora
Walters
Director-Paul Thomas Anderson
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by New Line Cinema - 01/00
This is explained in the opening prologue of Paul Thomas Anderson's
`Magnolia'. Our narrator (Ricky Jay) guides us through several unlikely
scenarios of chance and coincidence that display, with great humor, how
past relevance can intrude on the present. For instance: a man plummets
off the side of a building in a suicide attempt, but is inflicted with a
shotgun blast on his way to landing in netting that would have surely
saved his life. The shotgun was fired by his mother from their apartment
several floors below. With shotgun cocked, she was violently threatening
her husband when the weapon accidentally fired and struck their son on
his descent to the netting. But she insists that, to her knowledge, the
gun was never loaded. Coincidentally, it was he - the suicide `victim' -
had loaded the weapon a few weeks prior, hoping that it would end the
feuding his parents had continued for years. `These strange things
happen all the time,' the narrator concludes. P.T. Anderson has
collected a photo album of lonely, troubled characters in an
intersecting plot line that he uses to prove this thesis.
`Magnolia', a sprawling masterpiece of operatic grandeur, is an
ambitious film in which the director's inventive jest never seems to
stop flowing. Anderson leads us through several intertwining stories in
Los Angeles, and each is fascinating for separate reasons. There is the
story of cancer-stricken television producer Earl Partridge (Jason
Robards), who lies on his deathbed, attended to by his unstable young
wife (Julianne Moore) and a caring nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Earl
desperately wants to get in touch with his distant son, who, we soon
realize, is self-help sex guru Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise). Frank has
made himself an icon among males everywhere with his `Search and
Destroy' program and his energized public seminars, in which he
raucously lectures the audience on how to best invade female territory.
There's the story of game show legend Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall),
who has hosted the beloved quiz show `What Do Kids Know?' for 30-odd
years. Jimmy has also received the news that he is dying from cancer,
and, in light of the fact his strength is deteriorating faster than
anticipated, he tries to reunite with his daughter Claudia (Melora
Walters). Meanwhile, current `What Do Kids Know?' contestant Stanley
Spector (Jeremy Blackman) begins to notice his rigid father (Michael
Bowen) sees him as merely a walking encyclopedia for cash income. And
former child genius Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) ponders the
misfortune of his job at an electronics store, and looks back at his
brief and turbulent 15-minutes of fame.
Finally, there is the story of Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), a
mild-mannered police officer looking for love at age 32. In more ways
than one, Anderson uses the Kurring character as the backbone of the
story. He is kind and thoughtful where other characters are rough and
violent, adding some emotional stability to the mix. As an ensemble
piece, `Magnolia' is superbly crafted. The dignified and accomplished
cast of actors balance their screen time miraculously, and each is given
the spotlight at some pivotal time to properly voice their character's
emotional dilemma. Everyone (or almost everyone) is successful in
identifying with their character during these critical moments. Hall has
a positively stunning, heart-wrenching breakdown on the game show,
Robards is chillingly effective as he croaks out his untold confessions,
and Walters is phenomenal throughout. However, the brunt of the
recognition deserves to be bestowed upon Mr. Tom Cruise, who delivers a
dazzling, high-voltage performance as Frank Mackey - the kinetic ball of
vivacious energy at the center of Anderson's amazing concoction.
The cast is astonishing - but you knew that already. The outrageous kick
behind `Magnolia' is writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, a brilliant
filmmaker who shows infinite ambition to plumb the emotional depths of
this work in methods both extravagant and unique. Anderson received
endless praise for `Boogie Nights', his detailed account of pornographic
filmmaking in the 1970's. In `Magnolia', the director shows a keen and
thoughtful eye for pacing. At just over 3-hours in length, the film
could have been a tedious and pretentious experience, but it transforms
into a moving, thrilling and audaciously funny spectacle under
Anderson's wing. What David O. Russell did earlier this year with `Three
Kings', P.T. Anderson achieves again here. By the time a totally
outrageous, completely unexpected finale rolls around, you must
acknowledge the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson is a bold and ambitious
filmmaker, and `Magnolia' is a one-of-a-kind experience.
Another highlight is the soundtrack. Many scenes are accompanied by the
music of Aimee Mann, including one expertly integrated segment in which
the characters sing the lyrics of `Wise Up' in episodic fashion. The
musical score, by Jon Brion, blends seamlessly into the fast-moving
action in the 2nd act. But this is not necessarily a `viewer-friendly'
movie. I can tell you right now, many audience members will be utterly
confounded by the director's style - particularly the Biblical climax.
Those who get involved in the film, though, will realize the treasure
P.T. Anderson has delivered. `Magnolia' is a profound and effective
motion picture, and a monumental achievement in film.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)

Director-Jay Roach
Rated PG

Vannesa Kensington: `Austin, do you smoke after sex?'
Austin Powers: `I don't know baby, I've never looked!'
And so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer
season. Austin Powers 2, the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997, is
filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes
that will make you keel over with hilarity. The mind of Mike Myers is
obviously a very bizarre place.
Myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis, the bald
headed Dr. Evil, who is given much of the spotlight here. There's an
early scene in which Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) appear on a
Jerry Springer segment entitled `My Dad is Evil and Wants to Take Over
the World', hosted by Springer himself. Most of these talk-show gags,
spoofing everything from Oprah to Regis and Kathie Lee, are no longer as
funny as they once were. Happily, this is an exception, especially when
a fight breaks out between Dr. Evil and the other guests. (Sample
dialogue- `Come back here you mother #@%$^!! You want a piece of me?')
The audience was in stitches.
There are many good things about this sequel. Dr. Evil is now assisted
by Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a pint-sized clone who is the result of an
experiment gone awry. Mini-Me is the most perfect new character that any
fan could ask for, and Troyer does a terrific job of mimicking
everything that his big brother does, pinkie and all. Mindy Sterling
returns as Frau Farbissina, Evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick, and
here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an
underground bedroom chamber. This works surprisingly well. Afterward,
there's even a meeting at the coffee machine, where their awkwardness is
expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment.
Oh, yes... the plot. After a short honeymoon with Vanessa Kensington
(Elizabeth Hurley) that goes disastrously wrong, Powers is back on the
case to thwart the diabolical plans of Dr. Evil. In the original, the
subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to
hop between two time periods. Here, it's time travel. Dr. Evil has this
crazy plan to steal Austin's mojo (the source of his sexual powers), so
he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when Powers is still is
his freezing chamber. There, he employs a grotesque 600-pound Scottish
assassin named Fat Bastard (also Myers) to commandeer the mojo, so that
our future hero is left completely shagless.
Meanwhile, Austin is informed of Evil's wrong-doing by Basil Exposition
(Michael York), and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device
in the form of a Volkswagen Beetle. Once back in 1969, Powers meets a
foxy CIA operative named Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and learns
of Dr. Evil's plans to destroy Washington DC with a lazer on the moon.
In one of the many uproarious jabs at Star Wars, Evil calls the moon
base a `Death Star'. If there ever was a movie that knew from the start
it was a complete joke, it's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.
AP2 has many hilarious moments, much more so, than the original Austin
Powers. But what it doesn't have is the confident support system that
the first boasted, and the jokes are now more scattershot and
hit-and-miss. While Myers has a knack for delivering clever, inspired
gags, he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits. The hilarious
scene in the original involving Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his refusal
to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner. Robert
Wagner, as Dr. Evil's #2 man, has only one scene early on in the film,
where he lacks all the focus of the character. One nice surprise is Rob
Lowe, as the young #2, who patterns Wagner's voice and movements right
down to a tee.
There are more recycled jokes from the predecessor, including Kristen
Johnston as Ivana Humpalot (an unfunny rendition of Alotta Fagina). But
Myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project, and many
bits are side-splittingly funny. Don't miss an extended visual gag in a
tent, where the shadows leave much to the imagination....
Of the new characters, Graham doesn't leave much of an impression. Her
performance is merely okay, and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that
made Elizabeth Hurley so enjoyable before her. And as for Fat Bastard...
well, he provides one or two hilarious moments, but all of the obesity
jokes and bathroom talk go too far.
But my most severe complaint: Mr. Bigglesworth was only in one scene!!
But, with gritted teeth, I managed to get over that. This sequel will
not leave fans disappointed; it's more often than not a laugh riot. And,
I look optimistically to the future, where I foresee more installments
to the Austin Powers collection. If Myers can up the quota of fresh
ideas, we should be in store for much more.

Title
Review for Bachelor, The (1999)
`The Bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see.
Wading through this gooey, detestable sludge is quite the chore for even
a dedicated romantic. Those hoping to find some genuine charm and
feeling behind this Chris O'Donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere;
`The Bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few
brief moments of surprising poignancy. Awaiting these moments by
enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money.
Although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy
cocoon, Chris O'Donnell has an effortless charm as an actor. Most will
recognize him as the high-flying Robin from the two latest `Batman'
films, but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile. Can
O'Donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders? Perhaps, if he
found the proper vehicle... but `The Bachelor' falls far short of the
requirements. The actor just can't register with such a pathetic
screenplay as the guiding light to success. A few instances of adorable
humor aside, it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering
mess that is `The Bachelor'.
O'Donnell plays Jimmie, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's
progressing in a serious relationship with Anne (Renee Zellweger).
Jimmie takes Anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for
proposals, and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage. The problem is
that his proposal sucks. Big time. You can tell things aren't going
pleasantly, because Jimmie gets the infamous deer-in-the-headlights'
look when Anne questions his approach.
And then, the plot (along with the stupidity of the movie) thickens.
Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies suddenly, leaving a video will
behind for his grandson (who also happens to be his only living
relative). Everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is
passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to
Jimmie. Of course, there's a catch: he must get married before his 30th
birthday, stay joined with his bride for an entire decade, and produce
healthy children within the first five years. The bad news is that
Jimmie's birthday is the following day. With Anne out of town, he must
find a willing bride to share his riches with... and within a very
limited time frame.
There are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `The Bachelor'. For one,
the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with cliché.
Another is the colorful cast. O'Donnell and Zellweger are cute together,
and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from
drowning in it's own mediocrity. Ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky
grandfather figure, and James Cromwell is sincere and effective as a
wise priest dragged through Jimmie's marital adventures. And now the
cons: the approach may be interesting, but in trying an old-fashioned
method, director Gary Sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel. The
characters are drawn with obvious, broad strokes, and the plot is bogged
down with everything humanly imaginable.
Yes, `The Bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute. The screenplay is
lamely written, and the subject matter poorly conceived. The
considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted, along with
whatever promise the film initially contained. Potential goes out the
window early to suit Sinyor's `colorful' approach, but not a minute of
this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes. `The
Bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it.
You've seen the TV spots, haven't you? O'Donnell is madly rushing down a
deserted street and the caption reads `What is this man running from?'
In actuality, he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to
marry him and inherit his fortune (it's one of the few enjoyable
sequences in the film). After seeing the movie, I believe that the
approaching horde could be something else. O'Donnell could be running
from his angry fans, who have just endured `The Bachelor', and are
hunting him down for revenge.

Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
Starring-Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce,
Bruce Greenwood, Ben Kingsley and Philip Baker Hall
Director-William Friedkin
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Paramount Pictures - 04/00
`Rules of Engagement' is not the standard Hollywood treatment for
glorification of patriotism in battle. When covering this ground, the
film achieves adequate success, and poses some interesting questions
surrounding the line that separates heroic bravery from cowardly murder.
However, the film is the standard Hollywood treatment of the aftermath
of this patriotism. A textbook courtroom drama plagued with irksome,
ho-hum plotting straight out of `A Few Good Men', it's quickly apparent
that `Rules of Engagement' is a shameless indulgence in the worst of
Hollywood dramatization. Hence, it's nothing new.
Momentum is achieved promptly by seasoned director William Friedkin
(`The French Connection'), who, despite some vapid implausibility's,
manages to stage some brutally realistic and effective battle sequences.
We open in 1968 during the Vietnam War, where marines Terry Childers
(Samuel L. Jackson) and Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) are engaged in
battle. When their platoon is separated, Childers winds up saving
Hodges' life in extreme and courageous circumstances. Cut to 28 years in
the future, where both men are now highly decorated colonels. Hodges is
retiring to fly-fishing in relaxing backwood trout streams, but Childers
continues his service, and is called into action for an operation in
Yemen that requires the rescue and retrieval of the American Ambassador
(Ben Kingsley) and his family. Due to extremely hostile rioting by
Yemeni civilians and high-perched snipers surrounding the embassy,
Childers loses three marines, while another lay critically wounded. He
orders an open-fire into the crowd, mowing down over 80 rioters
including women and children, in a disturbing sequence of images that
Friedkin once again directs with nimble expertise. When Childers is
court-martialed under the charges of murder and defiance of the standard
rules of engagement for battle, his position in the marine core and
future is at stake. He heads to Hodges and requests that he represent
him in court. `I'm a good enough lawyer to know you need a better lawyer
than me,' is the stern reply.
`Rules of Engagement' is a superbly structured military drama so far, a
top-drawer model with stellar performances filling any cracks in the
inconsistent foundation. And then Hollywood sneaks under the radar and
takes hold of a potentially gripping story-line. The villain, played by
Canadian Bruce Greenwood, is U.S. National Secuirity Advisor William
Sokal. A cowardly weasel determined to find a scapegoat at any cost,
Sokal destroys evidence of the rioters opening fire that would clear
Childers' name. Like virtually everything in the film, the role seems
cluttered and unfinished, although Greenwood plays Sokal with enough
panache for forgiveness. Similar exoneration cannot be granted for the
remainder of the choppy, uninvolving second half, which nose-dives into
courtroom formula and the standard offering of gaping plot holes.
Accepting Childers' position is initially difficult, because he have
reluctance to scrounge up much sympathy for a man who slaughtered 83
people... and many of them innocent civilians. Future plot movements
make this easier, but the actions of Jackson's character are too often
inconclusive. Jones is also subject to unconvincing characteristics.
While Hodges openly admits he is an inexperienced attorney, he still
acts in feeble-minded ways, snapping pictures with a camera that looks
like those waterproof Kodak models you purchase at the grocery store.
The star performances are one of the strong suits of `Rules of
Engagement'. Jones and Jackson whole-heartedly convince us of their
friendship and military background. Both have done far better work, but
their high-powered verbal exchanges ignite the screen - particularly in
a few tantalizing moments of courtroom confrontation that rise above the
rest of the mundane triviality. Another key factor in these scenes is
Australian Guy Pearce (`L.A. Confidential'), who fiddles around quite
successfully with a New York accent to play prosecuting attorney Biggs,
and adds more fuel to the fire. Mostly everything else in `Rules of
Engagement' fizzles quietly, like a bad batch of pop rocks. Philip Baker
Hall (as Hodges' father) and Blair Underwood (as a fellow testifying
marine) are both solid but perpetually under-used. All promise of a
stirring, pensive drama is plowed over by the transparent clichés of
Stephen Gaghan's screenplay. Large portions of the script appear to be
in shambles, perhaps the indication of material tampering that goes
right to the core.
Any messages about war violence and its posterior consequences are lost
in a haze of Hollywood formula. In `Rules of Engagement', you can't
overlook the stellar acting and direction, but the remainder of this
sloppy military drama will leave you in awkward state of ho-hum
indifference. Sacrificing moral issues and fascinating war themes for
tedious plotting and an inconclusive finale? Only in Hollywood, my
friends.

Review for Bicentennial Man (1999)
You may assume `Bicentennial Man' is just going to be another
sentimental Robin Williams vehicle dripping with fabricated emotions and
melodrama. You would be mistaken. Although this Williams Christmas
offering has it's share of problems, sentimentality is indeed not one of
the major offenders.
You may also be led to believe that `Bicentennial Man' is for children,
with Williams in permanent shtick-mode playing a goofy futuristic robot
who supplies various punch-lines to please the kiddies. Again, you would
be mistaken. For any youngster expecting a non-stop barrage of slapstick
humor, this film will seem monotonous and dull in it's endless search
for dramatic depth. There is humor (and some of it is genuinely funny),
but `Bicentennial Man' will be best enjoyed by older viewers who are
more familiar with emotional tinkering. This age group may be more
appreciative of the few genuine aspects of the production. Others, I'm
afraid, may be lost in this awkward futuristic stew of special effects
and unrealized drama that `Bicentennial Man' has to offer.
The movie does have a few wonders of it's own. When we are first
introduced to Andrew (Robin Williams), a NDR-114 prototype android
designed as a helpful household appliance, the effect is utterly
charming. Andrew is the new property of Sir (Sam Neill) and Ma'am (Wendy
Crewson), and he takes a liking to their youngest daughter, Little Miss
(adorable Pepsi spokes-girl Hallie Kate Eisenberg). Sir begins to notice
that Andrew is showing a number of human characteristics (*gasp*),
including his ability to grasp the idea of humor and friendship. A
greedy business executive (wonderfully played by Stephen Root) wants to
reprogram Andrew so this `malfunction' can be properly repaired, but Sir
stands up for his desire to become more human, insisting that Andrew is
unique. For these 45 minutes in the Martin household, `Bicentennial Man'
shows enormous potential, with emotions that feel genuine and solid
character development across the board.
But, unfortunately, the film opts for an approach that spans the course
of 200 years into the future. Andrew, with his positronic brain,
survives through several generations while he attempts to `become
human'. The film radiates so much heart in this section that apparently
every other function was abandoned to compensate. It is awkward and
uncomfortable to see certain characters exit at such a rapid pace, for
even if the screen reads 12 Years Later', it has only been 12 minutes
for the audience. The film continues with this pattern until the
possibilities have been virtually exhausted, and director Chris Columbus
elects for a finale that is pleasant but completely under-calculated and
sappy.
Despite my disappointment regarding the film's lost potential, I still
think `Bicentennial Man' is decent family fare. Williams delivers an
appealing performance as the machine who has aspirations of becoming a
man, and then later does - with the help of an out-of-work inventor
named Rupert Graves (Oliver Platt, playing the typical quirky supporting
role we have become accustomed to). In both robotic and human form,
Williams is a charming display of naive splendor, as Andrew learns
everything from the birds and the bees to carving miniature mammals out
of wood. Embeth Davidtz plays a dual role as grown-up Little Miss, and
later her granddaughter Portia, who becomes a romantic interest for
Andrew in human form. Sam Neill is terrific, as usual, playing an
understanding man who first encourages Andrew to find inner freedom. The
performances are all amiable, the James Horner score is lovely, and the
film is swift, honest and funny with a great majority of it's humor.
The production values of `Bicentennial Man' are exceptional, with brief
glimpses of our future society presented with great imagination and
impressive special effects. There is an abundance of frank (but
well-handled) discussions about sex, and some mild coarse language
(Andrew calls a malfunctioning record player a `piece of fecal matter',
and is lectured in the proper method of cursing). And so I offer a
delicate warning: `Bicentennial Man' is not the ideal family movie. A
few aspects are rewarding, but the film, like the title character,
becomes far too mechanical as it goes along.

Review for Outside Providence (1999)
While exiting the theater after a recent showing of Outside Providence,
I heard this remark from a fellow audience patron: `Well, it was no
There's Something About Mary... but I liked it.' Of course it's no
There's Something About Mary. Comparing this to Mary would be a mistake,
because where that film is filled with outrageous sight gags and various
bodily fluids, Outside Providence is sweet and genuinely funny. It may
be co-written by the Farrelly brothers, but this is an earlier effort
that reveals a softer side. At least, softer than their previous
directorial efforts (also including the gross-out comedies Dumb and
Dumber and Kingpin).
70's nostalgia seems to be popping up often at the cinema lately, with
Dick and then Detroit Rock City appearing amongst the late summer movie
crowd. This entry features Shawn Hatosy (who recently fought alien
administrators in The Faculty) as Tim Dunphy, a trouble-making pot head
from Rhode Island. Tim is always involved in wrong-doings with his
friends (well, what does it tell you when his best chum is named Drugs
Delaney??). On this occasion, he runs into a parked police car, most
likely due to his impaired vision from a vehicle full of billowing
smoke. His father (Alec Baldwin) finally draws the line, and sends him
to a prep school named Cornwall Academy. This is the type of place that
forbids everything that Tim usually takes part in, namely smoking and
drinking.
Outside Providence is the kind of movie that, while not achieving
anything groundbreaking, has you leaving the theater with a smile
plastered across your face. The main protagonist is easily likable, and
the material is reasonably well-written. Those expecting another
`outrageous' comedy in the tradition of Mary should perhaps tread
elsewhere - the down-to-earth realism in this film may leave them
slightly disappointed. But, that's not to say Outside Providence isn't
funny. There are some great comic moments, captured perfectly in time by
director Michael Corrente (American Buffalo) and the Farrelly's nicely
paced screenplay.
The performances are also impressive. Hatosy doesn't have to work hard
to achieve a certain charm, and Alec Baldwin is wonderful. Playing a
poker-faced widower who sits around in his underwear eating ice cream,
Baldwin is delightfully convincing, and without putting an unnecessary
spin on his character. He plays it straight, fitting the character
requirements nicely (he's also got an interesting nickname for his
son...). As his poker buddy, Cheers veteran George Wendt is solid, and
Amy Smart displays all the charisma and vibrance needed for an adequate
romantic interest.
There is some moralizing going on beneath it's core, but the film
handles everything surprisingly naturally. Certain important issues are
dealt with, including (but not limited to) the loss of Tim's mother and
a member of the poker group coming out of the closet. There is also
plenty of drug use going on, so much, that it almost drains the film's
real purpose. There is nothing special about Outside Providence, which
is what could be described as a change of pace `coming-of-age' story
from the notorious brothers' Farrelly (aka Bobby and Peter). But the
film is entirely enjoyable, and fully equipped with a toe-tappin' 70's
soundtrack that aids the atmosphere nicely.
And those yearning for more classic Farrelly moments (like the widely
popular `hair gel' sequence) still will have a few brief seconds of
redemption. But those most likely to enjoy Outside Providence should be
expecting an honest, well-acted dramedy - a movie with real characters
instead of cardboard cut-outs designed to draw laughs. Yes, it's no
There's Something About Mary. But it remains good-natured fun in it's
own right.

Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
The number 4 does not seem to be very lucky when it comes to movie
sequels. After the atrocity Batman and Robin, I think that theory has
been more than justified.
The Batman movie franchise has had it's ups and downs. The series
started out with a bang in 1989, as the caped crusader was revived to
fight crime in a darker, moodier Gotham City as envisioned by director
Tim Burton. The box office receipts ensured room for a sequel. And so in
1992, Warner Bros. released the much anticipated Batman Returns, in
which Michael Keaton returned as the title character to fend off two new
super villains. Unfortunately, Burton had gone too far with the darkly
disturbing atmosphere that had inhabited the original, and the sequel
was dismissed by critics and audiences alike for being too dark and
heartless. A change of pace was taken for the third installment, Batman
Forever, including a new capped crusader and a fresh visionary behind
the camera. This Gotham City was more exciting, livelier, and in turn
more entertaining for the younger audiences that Batman had always been
intended for. But as the fourth comic book chapter rolls around, a
painful realization has occurred: just as Burton had let his second
outing with the Bat slip inexcusably through his fingers, Schumacher has
repeated the tradition with a botched sophomore outing.
As the third actor to portray our black-clad superhero, George Clooney
manages fine. He looks entirely comfortable suited up in the Batman
attire, whether acting as the debonair millionaire Bruce Wayne by day or
the elusive crime stopper by night. The performances are not the
problem. I didn't even seem to mind the villains: the chilly Mr. Freeze
(Arnold Schwarzenegger), a deranged former scientist bent on turning
Gotham into a giant icebox, and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), a seductive
plant women and the result of a bizarre experiment. The general
grievances that I had were based on the preposterous plot, the
slow-moving story, and the wasted production designs. Just as Batman
Forever succeeded with presenting us dazzling visual effects and
elaborate sets, this fourth installment goes totally overkill. There is
so much expensive production at hand that we are nearly lulled to sleep
with the continuing, boring repetitiveness.
The script is also incredibly cheesy. Early on, the Dynamic Duo (with
Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin) have a half-baked hockey game with
Freeze's henchman, using a priceless diamond as the `puck' as they skate
on an icy museum floor. Who would write such mindless crap? There are so
many hard-to-swallow coincidences engraved in the action, which makes it
extremely difficult to enjoy. And then there are a handful of corny one
liners from Schwarzenegger, as he taunts Batman and fellow police with
such quips as `You're not sending me to the cooler!' and `Chill!' I
found Arnie's delivery unintentionally hilarious, although I knew he was
doing his best with the preposterous material.
Batman and Robin is a case of frequent missed opportunities. Alicia
Silverstone makes an appearance at Wayne Manor, playing butler Alfred's
daredevil niece. Silverstone soon becomes Batgirl, but her performance
is devoid of the perkiness or charisma that it takes to be a superhero.
Elle MacPherson has a thankless role as Bruce's current love interest,
with one or two pointless scenes that register as more of a cameo. A
single sub-plot I somewhat enjoyed was the sudden illness that comes
over Alfred (nicely played, once again, by Michael Gough). But so much
of Batman and Robin has been carelessly buried in excessive cheesiness,
making it difficult to enjoy hardly anything without distractions.
Is Batman 5 around the corner? If so, I think the series could use a
severe makeover, starting (vitally) with an abrupt change of director.
While the future of Batman is questionable, it could be salvaged - if
sequels like this one are carefully avoided.

Title
Review for Ideal Husband, An (1998)
While not very filling in itself, An Ideal Husband is a nicely rounded
and all-together fluffy period romance. There's enough dashing
wardrobes, sharply-spoken dialogue and humorous plot twists to keep
everyone entertained - if they can stand a break from a summer full of
big-budget action movies.
Rupert Everett has always been a striking leading man, but he hasn't
been able to break through with a character since My Best Friend's
Wedding. At least, not this successfully. An Ideal Husband gives Everett
the role of the grouchy but handsomely divine Lord Arthur Goring.
Despite the constant bickering of his father (John Wood), Goring refuses
to settle down with someone or even consider marriage. His best friend
is the wealthy, popular politician Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam),
who is married himself to the calmly but beautiful Lady Gertrud (Cate
Blanchett). The central plot circulates not around Goring, but instead
deals with Sir Robert and some past problems that have come back to
haunt him. With the appearance of the mysterious Mrs. Chevely (Julianne
Moore), an old friend of the family, Sir Robert's life begins to
evaporate into deceit and mistrust. Mrs. Chevely has evidence of a past
scandal that could destroy Sir Robert's stand in politics, and she
threatens to blackmail him if he doesn't support her requests. With his
wealth and marriage on the line, Sir Robert turns to Lord Goring for
advice and friendship.
This plot outline successfully ties all of the lead characters into one
amusing web, including Mabel Chiltern (Minnie Driver), the witty and
sharp-tongued younger sister of Sir Robert. An Ideal Husband, based on a
play by Oscar Wilde, is set in the late 19th century. To be taken in by
the humor, we must first believe the time period. The set and production
designers responsible for An Ideal Husband do a commendable job of
bringing the horse-guided carriages and feathered hats to colorful life.
Kudos also to the makeup and costume artists, who have obviously spent
countless hours researching the fashions that wealthy men and women
(particularly the women) would wear. The wonderful setting of An Ideal
Husband makes it so much easier to absorb all the goings-on.
The dialogue throughout the film is bursting with brilliance, and it
helps matters that the experienced and talented cast is delivering such
lines. The confrontations are marvelous exchanges of devious wit and
wordplay, and there is never once a lull in the screenplay. There are
many clever quips spoken throughout, such as when Lord Goring states
with a conceited smile: `To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance...' Nicely said.
Although I may be jumping to conclusions (and making the assumption that
the late-summer kiddie flick Inspector Gadget will not win him raves),
I'd say this is going to be one of Rupert Everett's most memorable
performances. Everett is a scene-stealer in An Ideal Husband, with a
delightful knowledge of all his buffoonery that makes his character more
enjoyable. He's smart, captivating, and light on his feet. But to ignore
the supporting players would also be deemed entirely un-called for. The
entire cast looks simply smashing, from Driver's spirited turn to
Moore's deviously evil execution, it's just a viewing pleasure. In some
respects, the resolution of An Ideal Husband may be somewhat slight, and
the film is also too entirely short. But these are shortcomings gladly
forgotten as we are whisked away by the arresting dialogue and plot
turns.
There is little hope for this film to be widely recognized, with
competition like Will Smith and profane cardboard-constructed eight-year
olds. But nestled in the heart of summer lies this entertaining and
briskly enjoyable movie that will make more of a boom with critics and
audiences than Godzilla's thundering footsteps ever did.

Review for Negotiator, The (1998)
While it has the workings of a standard hostage film, The Negotiator is
something more than that. The reason? The two lead performances spark so
much interest and tension that the material is lifted above the regular
ante. As they face off against each other in a battle of wits and
intelligence, Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey stretch a limited
subject into a filling two-hour, twenty minute time slot.
Renowned police negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson) is in quite the pickle:
he's been framed for his partner's murder and accused of stealing money
from the police pension fund. While Roman stresses that he is innocent,
there is so much evidence against him that even his colleagues and
friends are pondering his guilt. And it's quite possible that someone in
his precinct is involved - he just has to find out who.
And so Roman does something crazy. At least it would seem crazy at first
glance; he walks into Internal Affairs and dukes it out with Inspector
Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) as he searches for the truth. Things get out of
hand, and Roman ends up taking hostages on the 20th floor. They include
Niebaum, his prickly secretary (Siobahn Fallon), and a computer fraud
specialist (Paul Giamatti) who was in a meeting at the time. The
incident is turned into a full-blown media event, which is exactly what
Roman had planned. He wants to intimidate Niebaum until he divulges the
identity of the killer, and this tight situation is the perfect way to
make him sweat it out.
Roman requests fellow negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), refusing
to listen to anyone else. The connection between the two is a simple
one: Sabian is a stranger, and right now Roman is having difficulty
trusting any friends. When Spacey enters the picture, The Negotiator
gets very interesting. Both are in the same profession, and each is
aware of the rules of the game. Roman can predict each move that Sabian
is planning next, and this is a marvelous tension builder. It becomes
clear that this is going to a long, hard-fought battle between two
determined men who are trying desperately to outsmart each other. It's a
treat, to say the least, while watching these verbal showdowns.
The Negotiator is still aware of it's basic hostage/takeover premise,
and it relies on this more toward the end. Roman ends up searching
Niebaum's files on his office computer, until some mysterious phone taps
come up. If there's one disappointing aspect of the film, it's the
obvious route for the resolution. For a movie so exciting and original
to turn into something conventional in the end is rather a
disappointment. But even when The Negotiator experiences an occasional
lapse in development, director F. Gary Gray is right there to set it
back on course once again.
As for the question of `whodunit?', it's one of the little worries.
We're so caught up in the fiery foreplay of the two stars that we nearly
forget about the initial plot. At some point, though, you begin to make
assumptions of the real killer's identity. It's a tough decision,
because everyone is a possible suspect. The arrogant team-player Beck
(David Morse) could be involved, or the chief (John Spencer) perhaps...
But take my advice: don't suspect anyone of the crime just because of
their relationship to Roman, because in the end it has little bearing on
the outcome.
Everything in The Negotiator would have been fairly routine if it
weren't for the quality of acting. Jackson and Spacey are both
excellent, commanding, and appropriately cast. Without their intense
confrontations, this film would collapse helplessly. But because of the
amount of excellence applied, this is one of the smarter action films to
come along in a while. And it's the best star vehicle that either actor
may get in many years to come.

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
Three Kings is the most unusual war movie you will ever see, and surely
one of the best. This brilliant Gulf War action / comedy is brimming
with razor-sharp comedy, deliriously exciting action and thoughtful
drama - with just a pinch of good old-fashioned Hollywood patriotism
thrown in to boot. In most films, all of these elements would create an
awkward and overstuffed dilemma for the audience. But, in Three Kings,
the finished product is expertly polished and wonderfully engaging. In
simple terms, the movie is flat-out great.
Any dedicated filmgoer with a true sense of passion for cinema is sure
to appreciate Three Kings. Where director David O. Russell could have
opted for a mere conventional approach, he transforms the film into
sheer outlandish brilliance. But, the thing is, the messages conveyed in
the film are also straightforward enough to please the average action
fan. It depends on your critical eye, but you may leave the theater
thinking either `That was awesome!!' or `That was unique, original and
totally absorbing. Why couldn't Hollywood be this brave more often?'
Russell doesn't waste any time with revealing his true intentions. The
film begins in 1991, just as the Gulf War has come to a close. American
soldiers are celebrating their dismissal with loud music and alcohol,
but not everyone is so anxious to return home. Sergeant Troy Barlow
(Mark Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Private Conrad Vig (Spike
Jonze) have stumbled upon a map that supposedly leads to a hidden stash
of gold bullion (stolen by Saddam Hussein from Kuwait). Major Archie
Gates (George Clooney), only two weeks from retirement, gets wind of
their plans and wants to join the expedition to the Iraqi bunker where
the bullion has been stored. The four soldiers set out with the
intentions of getting filthy rich.
The gold is recovered, yes, but other problems arise. The Iraqi rebels,
encouraged by President Bush to rise up against Saddam, are attempting
to fight for their freedom. But they were also informed that they would
get the support of American troops, and that has not happened. Gates
sees that the rebels are suffering, and suddenly the game plan has
changed: the soldiers are to stay and help the people from the grasp of
Saddam's army, and then they will continue on their way. Gates, Barlow,
Elgin and Vig get far more than they had originally bargained for - each
addressing certain moral issues that they feel strongly for, but have
never spoken up about.
Three Kings is probably the funniest movie I've seen all year, handling
it's comedy with a wry pleasure that most will find courageously
liberating. In the same respect, the film is heartbreaking and tragic as
well, offering many scenes of graphic war violence that are frightening
to watch transpire. Russell (who last directed the critically acclaimed
comedy Flirting With Disaster), with a watchful eye, balances everything
in a miraculous fashion. His screenplay, while containing a few periodic
lulls, is sure to remain one of the most striking and enjoyable of the
movie year.
The characters here are not emotionless cardboard stand-ups. You
actually feel for them. Clooney, who has always been a likable hero in
films like Out of Sight and From Dusk Till Dawn, is strong and
charismatic as always. Now that the actor has left ER, he is in dire
need of a theatrical hit (and if this won't deliver for him, nothing
will). Wahlberg is a convincing performer, and rapper Ice Cube adds some
impressive, subtle sub-texts to his character (even if his facial
expressions remain rather monotonous throughout the movie). The
supporting cast is led triumphantly by Spike Jonze, who is indeed the
`fourth king', even though the title may prove otherwise. Although at
first glance Private Vig appears to be just an annoying hillbilly
weasel, Jonze (a director himself) adds layers of unexpected personality
to the character - perhaps even emerging the standout.
The film has a fuzzed-out appearance that only assists in making the
desert climate more realistic. Russell's camera angles are nothing short
of glorious, including an interesting scene in which we see the effects
of a bullet ripping through a soldier's torso. For a film to be so
successful in so many areas is almost disarming, but Three Kings pulls
it off with incredible style. This is one of the most thought-provoking,
insanely original movies of the year. I recommend you drop any gold
bullion you may be carrying and rush to see it.

Title
Review for Down to You (2000)
Starring-Freddie Prinze Jr., Julia Stiles, Zak Orth,
Shawn Hatosy, Selma Blair and Henry Winkler
Director-Kris Isaacson
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Miramax Films - 01/00
Ahh yes. The teenage romance.  An attractive young cast is pitted into
an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies, and in the
end, the guy always gets the girl. And with the arrival of the breakout
hit `She's All That' last year (followed by a long catalogue of
imitators including `10 Things I Hate About You' and `Drive Me Crazy'),
the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity.
Along now comes `Down to You'. The folks at Miramax are obviously trying
to capitalize on the rabid `She's All That' craze with their latest
project, which has the studdly Freddie Prinze Jr. attached and all. Only
`Down to You' doesn't have the unlikely scenario' mentioned above. It
is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull, unattractive teen
comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to.
This is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find
convincing. In strictly textbook fashion, college sophomore and aspiring
chef Al (Prinze Jr.) meets freshman artist Imogen (Julia Stiles). They
hit it off like a couple can only in the movies. From here, it's the
standard boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl,
boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back
story. The plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of
the main characters, who are frequently taking part in activities
that.... well, only happen in the movies.
Fortunately, the cast of `Down to You' has a certain appeal. Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles are an adorable couple, and when on screen
together, they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie
should have centered around. Zak Orth, as the newly realized porn star
Monk, shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's
intelligent dialogue. Rounding out the impressive ensemble of young
talent are Shawn Hatosy (`The Faculty'), Selma Blair (`Cruel
Intentions') and Ashton Kutcher (TV's `That 70's Shows'). Even The Fonz
himself - Henry Winkler, the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia -
has a welcome role as Al's dad, the host of the popular cooking program
`Chef Ray'. Maybe the concept of `Down to You' looked good on paper to
draw such a crowd. As a feature film, however, the finished product is
bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to
keep the gears from stopping entirely.
Perhaps worst of all, `Down to You' is not funny. The jokes are drawn
from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired.
The characters on screen, often laughing at each other's
goofy/embarrassing antics, seemed far more amused than the audience.
Even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as
they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course. The one
mildly clever segment featured Winkler and Prinze Jr. in a fantasy
sequence called `Cooks', a `COPS' take-off in which the father and son
would storm houses and cook a decent meal for needy' families (with the
assistance of a fully-armed SWAT team, of course). When this is the
highlight reel, you know the remaining film could leave something to be
desired.
In order to make a teen comedy work, you've got to have characters that
show something by way of depth and identity. `10 Things I Hate About
You' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards,
and the result was refreshing. No such luck with `Down to You'. It's
just a textbook romance where, despite absurd circumstances, everything
is bound to work out in the end. And at the end of the whole clichéd
ordeal, the nicest thing you could possibly say would be `.... only in
the movies'.

Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
For More "MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton" Visit:
http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Runaway Bride is a Pretty Woman reunion that feels more light and fluffy
than it's predecessor. But, despite it's obvious tone and rather
formulaic script, it still manages to be a crowd-pleaser.
The stars do a great deal to enliven what is actually a sub-par romance.
Richard Gere plays Ike Graham, a USA Today columnist who is desperate
for a story idea. Through an acquaintance in a bar, he discovers
information that could make for interesting reading: a small-town girl
named Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts), dubbed as the `runaway bride',
has become notorious for leaving her groom at the alter for a series of
up to 7 or 8 incidents. Graham, rushing to meet the deadline, types up
the column to have it published in the paper the following day.
But the real Maggie Carpenter spots the headline, and does not
appreciate the gross exaggerations that Graham uses in his writing style
(she insists it was only three times that she high-tailed it out of a
wedding). His editor (and ex-wife, played by Rita Wilson) ends up firing
Ike, but a friend (played by Hector Elizondo) offers him another chance
to get his facts straight. And so the big city boy goes off to Hale,
Maryland to investigate the real truth and attempt to express his
apologies to Maggie. Who knows, the two might even fall for each other
in the end......
It was a wise move for director Gary Marshall to return to his romance
roots and try to re-invent his biggest hit. Lately, Marshall has been
lagging seriously behind (I'm pretty sure Exit to Eden didn't make any
Ten Best lists). This reunion with Roberts and Gere should be a
sure-fire hit, and even if the material is recycled scrap, the
presentation is modestly charming and always watchable. Both stars look
pretty enough to single-handedly save any film, no matter how terribly
the script may be constructed.
Runaway Bride is predictable, to say the least, but it has a certain
charm. The supporting cast is made up of largely familiar faces,
including another Pretty Woman vet: Hector Elizondo. Elizondo stole many
scenes in the 1990 film as a courteous hotel owner, and his performance
here is again impressive. Joan Cusack, as Maggie's quirky best friend,
is basically typecast once again and injects a lot of natural humor into
the proceedings. The two lead characters hate each other so much it
seems impossible that they'll end up together. Minimal sparks fly
between Roberts and Gere, but they both turn in believable performances,
even as they are being pushed toward a highly improbable happy ending.
Star power is the glue that holds this film together. The script has all
the regular clichés associated with this kind of film, and reliance on
the lead performances is huge. The set-up has some obvious problems, but
once Runaway Bride gets into a natural flow, it's easy to enjoy. But
please, next time spare us some of the humor associated with Maggie's
perverted grandmother, who explains in detail her disastrous honeymoon
night. This is a light romantic comedy, and a character like hers seems
somewhat out of place.
This is Julia Roberts' second summer romance (the first was Notting
Hill), and she has submitted another charming performance. Still, this
remains Pretty Woman-lite. The PG rating ensures the film is suitable
for family viewing, but it also adds some restrictions. Someone
searching for a sweet escape to the theater could do far worse than
Runaway Bride, if they are in the mood for something fitfully
entertaining but not terribly original. This has been done a dozen times
before, but never with this kind of star charisma.

Title
Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
I might as well go out and say it: I like Kevin Costner as an actor.
Some may argue he has little range, but that only assists in adding an
everyman appeal to the endearing actor. After taking such a lashing for
his post-apocalyptic bomb The Postman, Costner has returned to a subject
that has brought him much success: the American past-time of baseball.
For Love of the Game proves that, with Kevin Costner and baseball, you
really can't go wrong.
Joining an actor who is very experienced in this category is a director
who is not. Sam Raimi, best known for his gore-splattered Evil Dead
series, has made an amazing transition within the past few years. A
Simple Plan, his chilling tale of small-town crime, was widely hailed as
one of 1998's best films. And now Raimi (a fan of baseball himself) has
taken the reins of a project that is a total contrast to his 80's horror
films. It looks like the dedicated director may have success in any
genre (with exception of western, which he attempted in the ill-fated
The Quick and the Dead).
Costner plays aging Tigers' pitcher Billy Chapel, who is told by the
owner (Brian Cox) that the franchise has been sold. Pondering
retirement, Chapel steps out on the field at Yankee Stadium to pitch
what could be his final game. The spectators in New York greet the
pitcher with disgust (`Chapel, you suck!!!' and `You couldn't pitch a
tent!'), but he uses his concentration to block everything out. Chapel
begins to look back at his long and successful career, which also
revives memories of romance and family - mainly involving Kate (Kelly
Preston) and their relationship ups and downs through the years.
A friend of mine commented that he would have liked less Love and more
Game from the film, and I would have to agree. The baseball action is
used sparingly, but it captures the spirit and excitement of the great
game. The romance between Billy and Kate contains a few fundamental
flaws, but the stars have palpable chemistry and play their boundaries
perfectly. This is easily Costner's best performance in years. The
actor's undeniable appeal allows us to look past the lack of information
about Chapel's past. We see (unnecessary) flashbacks of his parents, but
know little about them. There is also great work from Preston, Jena
Malone, and John C. Reilly as a loyal catcher named Gus Sinski.
Raimi adds a swift momentum to any given situation. For Love of the Game
is solidly entertaining from beginning to end, which causes a refreshing
absence of flashing Indiglo watches during the show. The director
supports the material so well, perhaps with the one exception: a rushed
ending that denies the audience room to breath. The script Raimi has to
deal with is dependable but problematic. All the flaws seemed to be
drowned out by the consistent, reliable pace, which links romantic
flashbacks to the present game with seamless precision.
For Love of the Game also has wide appeal. Anyone who enjoys baseball
will be glued to their seats. I was a little disgusted to see a few
sports clichés - such as a couple of close calls involving hits that
just tail off into foul territory. But when Chapel begins to work on a
perfect game, Raimi handles the tension and unease perfectly. Romantic
film buffs will also love it, as will any Costner fan that still exists
(I hope there are still a few). Needless to say, this film is sure to be
a widespread crowd-pleaser for all ages.
I still prefer Field of Dreams, a wonderful fantasy that honors baseball
like a religion, to Costner's latest entry. But For Love of the Game is
an actual, genuine `good movie' from the Hollywood factory. I thoroughly
enjoyed it's loving tribute to a great game, and anyone with similar
feelings is sure to agree.

Title
Review for Supernova (2000)
Starring-James Spader, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster,
Peter Facinelli, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney and Wilson Cruz
Director-Thomas Lee
Canadian Rating-14A
MGM Pictures - 01/00
No one seems to want their name displayed on the new sci-fi thriller
`Supernova'. Action director Walter Hill (`48 Hours') demanded his name
be replaced by the pseudonym Thomas Lee (a new version of the infamous
Alan Smithee). His request was granted. It is also rumored that the
legendary Francis Ford Coppola stepped in after Hill retreated to finish
editing the film for release. Not surprisingly, his name is also nowhere
to be found. A poisonous black cloud of negative buzz surrounded this
notoriously troubled production from the start. But is it really as
terrible as you've been told?
Hell yes. `Supernova' is a lifelessly dull, derivative mess of a film.
The action sequences contain no excitement whatsoever. The scenes
intended to build a suspenseful atmosphere don't even begin to raise the
heart-rate. The movie is like a drugged-up race horse that doesn't even
make it out of the gate - the drugs being the endless post-production
tampering that occurred to make the film most presentable. I imagine
stars like James Spader and Angela Bassett, who have something of a
Hollywood image and are trying to maintain it, are really sweating it
because `Supernova' was actually released. You see, January is the
`aww-heck-let's release-it-now' month. Movies are dumped here with the
mild hope of a warm box office reception because the competition would
be too ferocious elsewhere. In essence, `Supernova' is the definitive
January release. In the heart of winter comes a movie that will really
send a chill up your spine (and not in a positive sense).
`Supernova' follows Emergency Medical Rescue Vessel `Nightingale', and
all of the crew who dwell within. Captain Marley (Robert Forster) enjoys
researching the history of cartoons (and that is the extent of his
character). Dr. Kaela Evers (Bassett) is the chief medical officer, who
says `S.T.A.T.!!' a lot. The remainder of the crew includes engineer
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) and two horny technicians (Lou Diamond
Phillips and Robin Tunney), who enjoy fooling around in zero gravity.
Sex seems to be the most amusing way to pass the time on the
`Nightingale', because it occupies a distressing majority of William
Malone's predictable rip-off of a screenplay. Or perhaps calling the
film a `rip-off' would be conceding too much credit. The film mixes
elements of `Alien', `Sphere' and `Event Horizon' - but nary a clever
twist is made.
Anyhoo, the ship intercepts a distress signal sent from a nearby moon
where a mining expedition is in progress. Unfortunately, Captain
Marley's brain implodes during a botched dimension jump, and recovering
drug-addict Nick Vanzant (Spader) takes command. To make a long story
short, they pick up a space scavenger (Peter Facinelli) who is
transporting a glowing orb of Jell-O mold, and everyone is violently
killed off until only Nick and Kaela remain. Any details of the plot are
rendered incomprehensible, and the movie slips into an intergalactic
coma from here on in. The climactic effect is true boredom once you
realize how little `Supernova' has to offer. All there is for
entertainment value is a few periodic flashes of colorful special
effects.... some of which are eye catching, but most are
straight-to-video quality. In short, the whole experience is depressing.
It's hard to say if there was ever the slightest hint of promise behind
the production of `Supernova'. If there ever was, that promise was
obviously suffocated in a plastic wrap of post-production tampering.
Several scenes from the trailer have disappeared without a trace, and
virtually every loose-end is left unattended. Tack on an anticlimactic
finale, and you have a science-fiction film with no thrills, no laughs
and (in return) no foreseeable audience. You might be curious to see how
perpetually bad `Supernova' is. Don't be. I will sum up the 85-minute
experience (which, by the way, felt twice as long) in a nutshell:  crew
on ship talk and have sex. Distress signal is received and answered.
Mysterious survivor comes aboard, and kills everyone. Mysterious
survivor is killed. There. The end... unless, of course, you march out
to the lobby and demand your money back.

Review for Ghostbusters II (1989)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Ghostbusters still stands the test of time. The original is one of my
favorite films, mainly because: a) the jokes never get old; b) the
special effects and story-line remain interesting; and c) Bill Murray
delivers one of the finest comedic performances ever caught on the
silver screen. Ghostbusters II, the long-awaited continuation released
five years afterward, has been dismissed as yet another sequel that
didn't live up to the original. But how could it? It must have been an
incredibly difficult task when Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis reunited and
attempted to duplicate the success of their first script. Ghostbusters
II is devoid of most of the clever details that made the first such a
complete joy, but it still manages to entertain with an amiable charm.
The four Ghostbusters - Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stanz (Dan
Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie
Hudson) - have separated, and chosen their individual paths. Peter,
although attaining his sarcastic and bitter tone, now hosts a cheesy and
low-rent TV series entitled `World of the Psychic'. Ray, when not
working at his Occult book shop, assists Winston in entertaining kids at
birthday parties (even though the groups yearn for He-Man). Egon
conducts tests involving human emotions and the effects of stress. The
group is reunited when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), the possessed
apartment dweller from the first, asks them to investigate a strange
occurrence involving her 8-month old baby and a runaway carriage.
They discover, after some illegal drilling, that a huge river of slime
is flowing under the city. Not only that, but there is also a demonic
painting at the city museum containing a deceased Carpathian god who
wants to join the party. The Ghostbusters once again team up, with the
help of their prickly secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) and taxing
accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), to save New York and attempt to
cause less damage than their first heroic stand.
Ghostbusters II is not particularly well-written. Things that were
clever and engaging in the first film seem occasionally forced and silly
when attempted here. With most of the fresh ghostbusting gags used up,
there is a lot of squandered opportunities. However, there are still
some funny lines scattered about. Murray still manages to shine even in
the absence of great material, and the film is single-handedly saved by
the performances. I enjoyed the directions chosen for Moranis'
character, and Peter MacNicol is very funny as an eccentric art guru who
works at the museum.
Those who enjoyed the original may be disappointed by the sequel's
apparent lack of freshness. Ramis and Aykroyd have attempted to rehash
the finale from the first, replacing the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (a
classic) with the Statue of Liberty walking through the streets of New
York. Of course, little in Ghostbusters II ever reaches the brilliance
of the film that preceded it, but most of the paranormal hijinks succeed
in entertaining the viewer. The plot is pretty ridiculous (mood slime?)
and poorly assembled, but not everything here is a total bust. Some of
the banter between Ray and Egon is even quirkier than in Ghostbusters,
as when they tie everything together:
Ray - Do you think there is some relation between this Vigo character
and the slime?
Egon - Is the atomic weight of Cobalt 58.9? (If you're confused, that
means `yes'.)
It is a lesser sequel, that's definite, but it remains an entertaining
alternative. There are surely worse things to do then revisit this story
of a group of paranormal exterminators and their adventures in
ghostbusting. It certainly doesn't make you loathe the entire existence
of Ghostbusters, but encourages you to appreciate the original even
more, while reviving some great childhood memories in the process.

Title
Review for Lost & Found (1999/I)
David Spade has a snide, sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly
on the TV sitcom Just Shoot Me. It also served as a good showcase for
him when he co-starred, opposite the late Chris Farley, in Tommy Boy and
Black Sheep. Lost and Found marks the comedian's first attempt at going
solo in a movie, and it also reveals that when Spade doesn't have a
reliable back-up system, his brand of humor seems more desperate than
one may expect.
David Spade is not the problem with Lost and Found. He plays Dylan
Ramsey, the sweet main character, to the best of his abilities. The
story revolves around Dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new
neighbour, Lila Dubois (Sophie Marceau, from Braveheart), and her
terrier named Jack. Dylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart
is through her dog. And so he kidnaps Jack, planning to stage a fake
rescue, in hope to win Lila over.
There are three good things about Lost and Found. The first is Spade.
The second is Sophie Marceau, a lovely actress who's been planted into
the wrong movie. Lastly, there's the dog, who is used here in a similar
context to Puffy from There's Something About Mary. Unfortunately,
director Jeff Pollack finds more humor in putting Jack through a cycle
in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute. This kind of
physical humor is dead. Pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch
with a baseball bat to get laughs, and this procedure is cheap, unfunny
and resoundingly cruel.
This is where I start to get fuzzy. Also in this unusual blend is
(apparently) a sweet-natured love story between Dylan and Lila. Given
the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for, I
found this hard to swallow. And, why does Dylan even deserve someone
like Lila, after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such
pain? Predictably, Lost and Found opts for a happy ending, one that
feels so sentimental, gooey, and rings so false that it sets off a siren
in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated.
David Spade (who also co-wrote the movie) tries hard, so very hard, to
make this project amusing. There are some choice scenes that are quite
funny, but the movie is only sporadically funny. Patrick Bruel plays the
stock character of Rene, the pompous jerk who also wants to win Lila
over, with his good looks and money. Jon Lovitz and Martin Sheen are
welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles.
Despite a few positive attributes, Lost and Found just doesn't work. If
you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy, you could do far
better than this obvious, misguided failure  that shows a blatant
disregard for what it's trying to present.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey  Hughton:   http://welcome.to/movieviews
If you see one sci-fi/action movie with Keanu Reeves this year, I would
highly recommend seeing The Matrix.
I was thoroughly pleased with this film, on more levels than one. First
off, in a world chock-full of brainless science-fiction movies with
irrelevant plots, it has a storyline that can carry the viewer from
beginning to end on a cushioned seat. Keanu Reeves', obviously not the
best actor in the world, makes for a fairly believable savior of
human-kind in the form of Thomas `Neo' Anderson. He is contacted by a
world-famous computer hacker named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who
thinks Neo is the `chosen one'. But I'm sure you're asking `What is the
Matrix?' and `The chosen one for what, exactly?'
The Matrix is, to quote a character in the movie, `the world that has
pulled over your eyes to shield you from the truth..' I'll not reveal
anything else, but consider this a favor toward you.
To learn how to manipulate the Matrix to his advantage, Neo first must
learn all the tricks of the trade (which involve spectacular stunts of
defying gravity, dodging bullets and leaping tall buildings in a single
bound, ala Superman). Then he must face-off against the enemy, called
the Sentinent Agents. They are dressed in black with strikingly cool
shades, and are headed by the immensely droll Agent Smith (the
delightfully deadpan Hugo Weaving). The acting is an all-around
surprise. In addition to Reeves there's the always excellent Fishburne
filling his role perfectly, and a hot newcomer named Carrie-Anne Moss,
who can seriously bruise a SWAT team. The special effects are seamless
and jaw-dropping, but they don't upstage the human dimensions of the
story.
I'll get right to the point: the action sequences in this film are
absolutely the best I've ever seen. The Wachowski brothers, Larry and
Andy, have obviously covered the book on how to construct a jaw-dropping
shootout. Until now, John Woo has been the unprecedented king of a
slo-mo action sequence. Until now. Even more impressive, however, are
the film's martial arts battles, which use a familiar device from the
Gap TV ads, where the camera circles the room while a character freezes
in midair with a drop-kick maneuver. Your reaction is bound to resemble
`Wow', or `Holy...' after seeing these unbelievable feats.
I had my grievances. There was an unnecessary double-cross scenario
planted unwisely into the 2nd act, and a few of the supporting
characters were only clichés from other movies of this kind. The Matrix
as a whole is a dazzling, wonderfully exciting escape from reality. What
is the Matrix? No, I won't tell, but it's a heck of a lot of fun finding
out.

Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
Cookie's Fortune is a light, quirky and enjoyable small-town comedy
about a single homicide that shakes everyone up. However, it's not a
murder mystery. We know how the events transpired. What Cookie's Fortune
revolves around is the manner in which the townspeople react to the
tragedy - some with despair, and others with insane lunacy.
The title character, played by Patricia Neal, is a kindly and thoughtful
old lady has inherited the wealth of her husband who died several years
earlier. Just as Easter weekend approaches, Cookie has gone and done
something shocking: she's committed suicide. Her two nieces, Camille
(Glenn Close) and Cora (Julianne Moore), stumble onto the body while
searching for a salad bowl. Camille is disgusted by the thought of
suicide in the family, and so she rearranges the scene to make it appear
as if Cookie had been murdered by an unidentified burglar who broke into
the house. Cora, desperately short on brain cells, agrees to back up
Camille's story when the police investigation begins.
The small local police force is led by Sheriff Lester (Ned Beatty), and
backed up by rookie officer Jason (Chris O'Donnell), who jumps
enthusiastically at the chance to grab his gun from the holster and
approach a crime scene like the fourth member of Charlie's Angels. After
Camille and Cora explain their tall tale to everyone, a fingerprints
check is run. A match is found in local booze-hound Willis (Charles S.
Dutton), a good friend and loyal companion of the victim. In reality,
Willis was only cleaning Cookie's guns the night prior to the incident,
one of which was used as the murder' weapon.
Altman's detailed character relationships are what makes Cookie's
Fortune such a pleasant experience. The interactions between Willis and
catfish girl Emma (Liv Tyler), Cora's rebellious daughter, are flat-out
delightful. Everyone in the film has a sweet, agreeable characteristic
of some kind. Jason and Cora are dim-witted but charming, Willis is
honest and reliable, and Emma has a magnetic personality. The one
character who perhaps doesn't register under that category is the
apprehensible Camille, who treats even her closest relatives like dirt.
Close, with wonderful over-the-top zaniness, shines brightly with the
stand-out performance of the cast.
Another actor who demands immediate attention is the swift and assured
Charles S. Dutton. A veteran actor of countless supporting roles, Dutton
is easily one of the most convincing auras to grace the good screen in
months. The natural charm that he so amiably carries is welcome
throughout Cookie's Fortune - but he's backed in style by the remainder
of the talented cast, with particular emphasis on Close and Tyler.
Veteran Academy-award winning actress Patricia Neal lends just the
required amount of lovable nature to the instantly endearing character
of Cookie, up until her expected demise.
Cookie's Fortune lacks the nasty edge of other Altman material (such as
The Player and MASH), but there are a lot of minor delights. For
example: the romantic liaisons between O'Donnell and Tyler, as they slip
behind a Coke machine for some secretive physical engagements. And the
way Tyler slips in some appreciated Jack Daniels into Dutton's coffee
when he's camping out in his jail cell. `Do you want cream with that?'
she asks. `Yeah,' he replies, `heavy on the cream.'
Cookie's Fortune cannot maintain it's comic ease until the credits roll,
but the experience, although somewhat slight, is a pleasantly diverting
method of spending a few hours. The ensemble cast is delightful, and
while the film doesn't offer any groundbreaking elements, it's engaging
from beginning to end. The bottom line: this light Cookie will do for a
tasty snack if you should feel a craving for something mild and
enjoyable.

Title
Review for From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)
Starring-George Clooney, Harvey Kietel, Juliette Lewis, Quentin
Tarantino, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Fred Williamson and Tom Savini
Director-Robert Rodriguez
Rated R
Dimension
What From Dusk Till Dawn is, I'm not so sure. It's two completely
different movies sewn together to make a freakish looking final product.
One is a gangster story with violent and profane mannerisms, much like
earlier work of writer and co-star Quentin Tarantino. The second is a
gory bloodbath involving a battle against the un-dead, lots of
explosives and severed limbs. Where one story merges into another is
hard to say - but the result is an enjoyable time, if you've got the
stomach to withstand it.
The story picks up in the desert near the Mexican border, where the
Gecko brothers - Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino) - have
just robbed a bank and killed four rangers in the process. They need to
pass the border so they can meet their accomplice at a Mexican
rendezvous point, but have trouble maintaining a living hostage in their
possession, because Richie is prone to shooting them. Stopped at a
motel, they come upon a former preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey
Kietel), and his two children (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). They even
have a motorhome - perfect for a quiet getaway. And so the brothers'
take the family of three hostage, until they have safely crossed the
Mexican border and reached their destination.
The rendezvous point chosen is a wild, raunchy biker bar called the
`Titty Twister', populated by naked women and tight-fisted truckers.
This is where things get really bizarre. After Seth and Richie bruise up
some of the locals, it becomes apparent that the Titty Twister is
infested with ravenous vampires hungry for blood. From here on in, the
movie turns into a gory action fest that never lets up. Tarantino and
director Robert Rodriguez steal largely from films like Sam Raimi's Evil
Dead, but this part of From Dusk Till Dawn is more of a homage than
rip-off. And there is no room for the squeamish; heads roll, people are
disemboweled, and chunky flesh splatters in all directions. But it also
means that the main characters must also depend on each other, so they
can make it until dawn alive.
>From Dusk Till Dawn is a fun movie. The entire second half is done with
tongue-in-cheek, making it more ridiculous than scary. Part of the
enjoyment comes in the casting; for instance, hunky TV star George
Clooney is admittedly an odd choice to play the hero figure in something
like this. But in a pleasant surprise, Clooney is admirably game as he
mangles the hapless vampire race with amusing enthusiasm. Kietel, in the
midst of such a ridiculous plot alteration, still manages to deliver a
fairly good performance. And then there are other survivors in the bar,
who amazingly have the ability to slaughter vampires as if they do it
for a living. In a neat bit of casting, one such character is played by
famous makeup guru Tom Savini, who calls himself (for no apparent
reason) `sex machine'. Salma Hayek plays a voluptuous Mexican dancer
named Satinico Pandemonium. But alas, she is a vampire too.
As expected in a Tarantino film, the exchanges of dialogue are spewed
out in sharp and witty bursts of startling profanity between characters.
But all that is weighed down when the silly monster plot abruptly takes
over. And practically everything seems so appropriate in the third act
of this movie. For instance, hordes of vampires can't get through a
small wooden door (or even attempt to) as the main characters anti up
with weapons found in crates that truckers had brought through. Then, as
the good guys launch an assault using crossbows and super soakers filled
with holy water (that was clever), the un-dead seem to keel over a bit
too easy. Plus, all myths and legends associated with vampire movies
(garlic, crosses, etc.) conveniently work like a charm. But what's the
use of this criticism? The movie checked it's brain at the door, but was
fun anyhow.
If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino films, you should enjoy From Dusk
Till Dawn. At least the first half.

Title
Review for Shining, The (1980)
The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version of Stephen King's
novel, received a highly mixed reaction from audiences when originally
released. Some King fans, and the author himself, felt that Kubrick had
left out many important details and created a simplistic version that
paled in comparison to the novel. Other viewers accepted the film as
what it was: a skillful, atmospheric and effective horror masterpiece
that provided an impressive helping of white-knuckle scares.
I've never read King's novel, and perhaps that's a good thing. The movie
I saw was amazing. Kubrick gave the Overlook Hotel, the film's desolate
setting, a personality of it's own. From the sweeping hallways and
checkered interior to the mysterious hedge maze outside the front doors,
the Overlook was the place nightmares were made of. Not a structure out
of The Haunting, which went straight for a frightening, gothic appeal.
The hotel in The Shining is scary because of it's hidden evil, one that
wasn't directly expressed on screen - and this creepy atmosphere is the
primary reason why Kubrick succeeds.
Jack Nicholson coins many famous phrases here, among them the widely
used `Here's Johnny!' and the endless typed pages of `All work and no
play make Jack a dull boy'.
Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a writer who applies for the job of fall
caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. For this six month period, along with
his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd), Torrence is
given the task of being the fall caretaker. Although warned that the
hotel could gradually give him a severe case of cabin fever, Jack sees
it as an opportunity to get some writing done.
But the real story here lies within young Danny, who has the ability to
`shine'. This is a power not unlike ESP, and it's shared by the janitor
at the Overlook (Scatman Crothers). Danny sees frightening images in his
mind of the hotel hallways filling with blood, and of two young girls
beckoning for him to come `play with them'. It's afterward that we find
out that a former caretaker at the Overlook went psychotic after many
months of desolation, killing his wife and two little girls with an axe.
Surely enough, Jack's mind begins to give in to a murderous case of
cabin fever, and he goes after Wendy and Danny with a rather unpleasant
intent.
Essentially, atmosphere is why The Shining succeeds as well as it does.
The atmospheric, goosebump-inducing surroundings of the Overlook Hotel
help to overshadow a few major fundamental flaws in the plot. One is
Duvall's character, which is often one-dimensional. Her emotions lead
her straight from a loving housewife to a woman distraught and running
in fear, when there should be a definite transition in-between.
(WARNING-Spoilers ahead). Another is the use of the Scatman Crothers'
character. The poor guy senses that something is wrong, travels hundreds
of miles via various transports, and then fights through a nasty
blizzard to get up to the Hotel. As soon as he enters, he gets an axe in
the chest. I've heard this is one of the complaints that Stephen King
fans had about Kubrick's version, noting that the character was used to
a much bigger (and more important) extent in the novel. King, in fact,
made his own mini-series in 1997 with Steven Weber in the title role.
Kubrick does many things right here, too. The use of camera angles is
stunning and effective, from the opening helicopter shot to Danny's
ventures through the winding hallways on his pedal bike. There is genius
at work behind the lighting, which is perfectly fixated with light and
dark tones in certain scenes. And Nicholson submits a chilling, eerie
portrait of a man who's lost his bearings so badly that he resorts to
stalking his own family with an axe. The final chase through the hedge
maze is absolutely thrilling, perfectly realized at every twist and
turn.
The Shining is a movie not devoid of flaws, but it's still an expertly
crafted exercise in fear.

Title
Review for Bats (1999/I)
`Bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror
movie fan. To pull something like this off, you need to have a sense of
wit and style, with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if
the fright factor ever declines. Something like the underground worm
thriller `Tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements, and
in return, the film was tremendous fun. With the notable exception of a
wisecracking supporting player, `Bats' mainly plays it's premise for
straight-arrow horror. Judging by the ridiculous premise, this was not
exactly a wise move.
The movie attempts to capture the essence of Alfred Hitchcock's `The
Birds', but fails miserably. Done right, it could have been adequately
amusing Halloween cinema. Unfortunately, `Bats' is a prime example of a
formula movie done terribly, terribly wrong. The only thing amusing
about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers
anticipate their core audience to be. I will recite the following
paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to
whom `Bats' is aimed toward.
Those guys in Hollywood have made a movie about bats. These bats are not
very nice, because they eat a lot of people. Boy, are these bats ugly.
They are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper
smart. They've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly
at all. A whole bunch of people in Texas get killed, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats. They have big guns
and other cool things to fight them with, but the bats are pretty smart,
so it's sorta hard to do. The bats swoop down and they shoot at them to
make they go away for good.
But no, `Bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers. The film,
directed by Louis Morneau, should have ventured straight into video
stores. On the small screen, perhaps more fun could have been derived
with lower expectations. But sitting through this crapper on the big
screen is almost awkward; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty
pleasure, the film is poorly written, poorly acted and executed with
glaring ineptitude. Even the bats themselves are cheesy, and the attack
sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed.
The sheriff in the story is Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), who
embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually
portrays (he chomps on a cigar, struts contentedly in his boots,
etc...). The scientist is Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer), who
specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her
field'. Meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie
seem more intellectually capable, but everything about Dr. Casper is
recycled beyond recognition. Her memories of how she became hooked on
the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like Oceanographic student Matt
Hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `Jaws'.
Everything revolving around `Bats' is tired drivel, which desperately
requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up.
The supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw, with
voices dubbed in later. In fact, that may have worked out better in the
end. Take one glance at Casper's bat-loathing sidekick Jimmy (Leon), and
you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy
caricature from every other movie, constructed specifically for timed
comic relief. Unfortunately, none of his comic interludes are funny. In
the role of deranged mad scientist Dr. McCabe, the reliable Bob Gunton
gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch.
McCabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects, and the
virus spread to other bats. The entire town of Gallup, Texas is under
attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures, but Gunton appears to be
inconspicuously contemplating something else. Something like: `When is
the damn movie going to be over?? I just want my money.'
The bats are ugly, I must say. There's the occasional moment where they
look moderately convincing, but mainly, the swarm is represented in
cheesy digital imagery. Only bits of the bloody action even hint at the
campy fun the film could have been, but by the absurdly stupid climax,
it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery. Characters
experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire. Let's explore the
logic there: is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat
population?? You could empty an entire clip at the flying winged
serpents and not even wound one, and after that there are only 18, 000
more of them. This kind of behavior represents the regular level of
intelligence behind `Bats'.

Title
Review for Iron Giant, The (1999)
More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Do yourself a favor. Skip Inspector Gadget, a special-effects filled
junk heap with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and see The Iron Giant
instead. This film successfully juggles a wide-range of humor, emotions
and family fun to translate into great entertainment for kids and adults
alike.
Don't be turned off by Warner Bros. previous animated outings. Both
Quest for Camelot and The King and I were enormous financial and
critical flops, creating a questionable future for non-Disney animated
features. The Iron Giant, with an astonishingly mature and well-written
script, manages to defy all odds. Look past the appearance (which may
look mediocre after the visual feast of Tarzan), and you'll be delighted
to find a movie that is memorable, sweet and genial.
The story, although taken largely from ET, manages to succeed on
virtually all levels. It tells the story of young Hogarth (voice of Eli
Marienthal) and his discovery of an enormous metal man that crash lands
near the town of Rockwell, Maine. Hogarth knows he must keep him a
secret, especially from his mother (Jennifer Aniston) and other citizens
of Rockwell. The giant (who is given speech, perfectly, by Vin Diesel)
is originally a horrifying sight, but Hogarth comes to realize that his
newfound friend is more kind-hearted than he is threatening. One
problem: he eats metal (namely cars and tractors), and providing
adequate sustenance for him becomes a difficult task. Luckily, there is
a kindly junkyard owner (Harry Connick Jr.) nearby, and after the
initial shock he allows the giant to hide out on the premises.
But there is always, always someone out to do no good in a film like
this. In The Iron Giant, the antagonist is a devious slimeball named
Kent Mansely (Christopher McDonald), a government agent investigating a
mysterious lead in Rockwell. Mansely rents the extra room at Hogarth's
house, and is frequently questioning the boy about what he knows. While
his character is strictly by the books, McDonald does an extremely
commendable job as the run-of-the-mill sleazeball, bringing Mansely to
humorous life with tactical and well-spoken precision.
The Iron Giant teaches valuable lessons, and is surprisingly successful
at it as well. Hogarth educates the giant about death, spirit, and most
importantly: that `guns are bad.' In one of the film's very few
disappointments, some of these lessons are discarded in the finale in
favor of a military battle. Still, the film has an overwhelming heart
and a sense of good nature that shines through every scene, even if the
story occasionally relies on formula.
The animation in The Iron Giant is perhaps the only noticeable defect.
Certain close-up shots of important details could have been handled with
better proficiency. But, in comparison to Warner's earlier animated
work, this is an impressive step forward. Although The Iron Giant's
visual appearance may seem sub-par in comparison with Disney, it is
actually very well executed. And as for the written content, well, this
is a real nice surprise. There is effective drama and wonderful humor
that both children and their parents can enjoy. While the younger
viewers marvel at the giant's movements and overall sweetness, adults
will find themselves involved in the story and touching character
relationships. And there is, indeed, some nicely distributed laughs that
everyone will enjoy.
There is a lot to admire in The Iron Giant. The subject matter,
occasionally, meets and even surpasses that of Tarzan, despite the fact
that Disney has the obvious edge. This is a good, wholesome family film
that should please viewers of all ages, with one of the more appealing
alien costars ever to appear on the big screen. He may be a giant heap
of metal, but the iron giant is more human than any character you may
ever encounter.

Review for American Beauty (1999)
`Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser' says Lester
Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a 42-year old husband and father who is
experiencing a mid-life crisis. Lester and his wife Carolyn (Annette
Bening) are living out a normal, everyday marriage merely to provide an
adequate living environment for their teenage daughter, Jane (Thora
Birch). The only reason Lester continues on with the pointless charade
classified as `life' is his daily masturbating session in the shower.
Everything is downhill from there.
American Beauty isn't so much the chronicle of Lester's downfall than it
is the story of his rebirth. If you `look closer' beneath the glossy
surface, as the film's trailer suggests, you will find a film stirring
with truth and poignancy. Some will enjoy the film merely for it's
dead-on portrayal of a present day nuclear family, played out in the
fashion of a scathingly funny prime-time sitcom. Others will look beyond
that and *experience* American Beauty, as it explores the human mind and
ponders the ordinary existence that Lester forges ahead with every
morning.
Director Sam Mendes has done something remarkable with his directorial
debut. He has introduced us to three fully realized, richly detailed
characters that everyone can relate to in one way or another. Mendes
paints a beautiful picture around the Burnham family, and his delicate
style is immersed in storytelling brilliance. I foolishly made the
mistake of assuming American Beauty would simply revolve around Spacey's
awkward breakdown. In actuality, the film delves much deeper into the
nature of being human, and it delivers a relentlessly truthful and
unexpectedly powerful fable of everyday suburbia.
Spacey's work here is beyond brilliant. His performance as Lester
Burnham is sure to garner him an Oscar nomination, and for good reason.
The actor has perfectly realized Lester's difficult situation, but he
also respects the characters limitations like a genuine Hollywood
craftsman. Scenes at the Burnham dinner table strike the perfect tone,
as Lester (with the artificial smile of a caring father) desperately
attempts to connect with his daughter using the obvious `How was your
day at school, honey?' approach. It reeks of hopeless detachment, just
as Lester's fruitless job as a tele-marketer, and essentially every
minute of his pointless life.
When he and Carolyn attend a basketball game to view their daughter's
cheerleading abilities, Lester finds a reason to continue living: a
divinely attractive teenager named Angela (Mena Suvari). Despite the
notable fact that she and Jane are close friends, Lester begins
hopelessly lusting over the blond angel, experiencing surreal fantasies
in which her naked body is delicately covered with fallen rose petals.
He begins to lift weights and smoke pot on a regular basis, all with the
single hope of sleeping with Angela when the time is right. As Lester
puts it so very bluntly, `I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to
lose'. Truer words have never been spoken.
Annette Bening, so ultimately convincing in a heartbreaking performance,
backs up Spacey with reliable persistence. Even as Lester loses his grip
on modern society, the lives of Carolyn and Jane are spiraling out of
control as well. Carolyn, unhappy with her job as a real estate agent,
tries valiantly to be a loyal wife and caring mother. She finds her own
escape when she christens a heated affair with a business competitor
(Peter Gallagher), who calls himself `The King'. Jane, convinced she has
no support from her parents, finds an unlikely curiosity in the weirdo
next-door (Wes Bentley), who videotapes everything as if worried he may
loose his grasp on reality. His father (Chris Cooper), an ex-marine and
right-wing gay basher, makes him provide a urine sample every 6 months
for drug testing. All of the characters in American Beauty have more to
reveal than initially evident.
Rarely has a film struck me with it's audacious courage the way American
Beauty has. The film - powered by astonishing performances from Spacey,
Bening, Bentley and Cooper - has an amazing power that affects the
viewer in places they least expect. As both a masterfully perceptive
tragedy and a bitingly funny satire,  it's a film of devastating and
unforgettable magnitude. The way it explores Lester's inadequacies - and
his realization that society has gone to hell - feels frighteningly true
to life. The poignant, touching and heartbreaking experience of American
Beauty is perhaps the two most rewarding hours you will ever spend in a
movie theater.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
Starring-Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames and Will Patton
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:   http://welcome.to/movieviews
Anyone who says Sean Connery is getting too old for action movies hasn't
seen his latest movie. Connery will always be remembered as the
definitive James Bond, and in Entrapment, part of the fun is watching
him replay certain shades that made his portrayal of the famous spy so
popular. His age is starting to show, but you have to hand it to Mr.
Connery, because he sure is a good sport.
In Entrapment he plays Mac, a master thief with high-tech gadgets for
scaling buildings and stealing antique Rembrandts for his personal
collection. He catches the eye of an insurance agent (!!) named Gin
Baker, Catherine Zeta-Jones. With the news that a priceless chinese mask
is being displayed in a London museum, Zeta-Jones knows that Mac won't
be able to resist the chance to snatch it. So she tracks him down and
poses as a thief, proposing that the two become partners in crime and
attempt the daring heist. Of course, her boss (Will Patton) wants her to
bring Mac in afterward. But carefully predicting the pattern of their
meetings, you can surely guess that their relationship will escalate to
something more than business.
Zeta-Jones is 29, and Connery is now 68. With this enormous age
differential, can the stars still create believable chemistry? The
answer is a surprising yes. Director Jon Amiel plays their relationship
on a different level than just a love story, in fact, he stages their
confrontations like they were father and daughter. If this is simply a
massive error, then it was a turn for the better, because this way the
stars are given more breathing room and their chemistry is still
believable. In one scene toward the end, when the two burglars separate,
you realize that you actually care about their situation. Even if he
could play her grandpa.
One disappointement is the use of the supporting cast. Ving Rhames is
once again electric and involving, as one of Mac's former partners, but
he is criminally underused with his undemanding role. Maury Chaykin hams
it up as a Budha-like art dealer. Will Patton has little to do playing
Zeta-Jones' boss. Amiel also uses a fade-out approach to end many of his
scenes, which gets very repetitive very quickly.
But, Entrapment is still an exciting heist adventure that glides along
smoothly after a bumpy first hour. The final robbery that the duo pull,
an 8-billion bank caper on the eve of the millenium, is simply terrific.
I never even glanced at my watch through the two-hour running time.
Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a flawed but luminous performance, and
Connery is just a lot of fun to watch. Reports indicate he may return
once more as James Bond. No matter how old he is then, I'll probably
still buy it.

Title
Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
Starring-Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy,
Whoopi Goldberg, Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto and Vanessa Redgrave
Director-James Mangold
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Columbia Pictures - 01/00
In `Girl, Interrupted', Susanna (Winona Ryder) is diagnosed with
`borderline personality disorder' and sent for a `friendly rest' at the
Claymoore psychiatric hospital. The reason? She recently downed an
entire bottle of aspirin with a vodka chaser, a move that that has been
classified as a failed suicide attempt by her doctor and superiors. But
does Susanna really require a period of rehabilitation in a mental ward?
You would assume she doesn't belong, but before you can say `One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest', Susanna is making new friends and finding
herself oddly comfortable within the walls of Claymoore.
`Girl, Interrupted' is the screen adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir
that followed her 18-month experience in a psychiatric hospital. The
Hollywood interpreter is talented young director James Mangold (`Heavy',
`Cop Land'), and along with a capable ensemble cast of intelligent
up-and-comers,  Mangold is able to craft an intriguing character study
within an unsettling environment. The personalities at Claymoore are
interesting to behold, particularly the wild cat sociopath Lisa
(Angelina Jolie), the rebellious leader of the asylum hierarchy who has
been a patient there for eight years. Georgina (Clea DuVall), Susanna's
new roommate, is a relatively sane pathological liar. Daisy (Brittany
Murphy) has a problem with food, in that she will only eat her father's
rotisserie chicken. And the list goes on. While `Girl, Interrupted'
attempts to explore it's characters with great depth, the plot sits
inert and lacking destination. The result is an odd but engaging mixture
with separate objectives for storyline and characters. Due to the
tremendous abilities of the largely female cast, the latter arena
prevails.
`Girl, Interrupted' dances around a large portion of the character's
issues, always lacking the expertise to tackle them head-on.  Mangold
manages to persuade us that his film is more intuitive than it should
be, and that seems reason enough to remained tuned in to the character's
problems. Whoopi Goldberg, sporting an afro and smart-looking
spectacles, plays the wise welfare mom Nurse Valerie in a way only
Whoopi could. Unfortunately, in terms of helping Susanna cope with her
situation, Nurse Valerie only lays out the basic schematics of her
`unique' condition... and the character lacks the compelling nature that
was probably conveyed on paper. Jeffrey Tambor (as the head psychiatrist
at Claymoore) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Susanna's doctor) are not
portrayed in the same light. They appear to misunderstand Susanna's
condition (if she has one), and such an action would be not difficult to
comprehend given the screenplay's lack of proper definition and
encompassment.
Mangold's strong suits include being able to coax a convincing
performance out of his actors. Ryder has many stunning moments as
Susanna, the seemingly misplaced young girl whose troubles extend
further than initially evident. But Jolie's considerable talent (on
showcase in `Playing by Heart' and, most recently, `The Bone Collector')
is the most commanding aspect of the film. Interaction between Susanna
and Lisa strikes the perfect thought-provoking chord, right up to and
through the sloppy finale. Ensemble acting is what makes `Girl,
Interrupted' a worthwhile experience, followed closely by what Mangold
cleverly passes off as solid character development. These young women at
Claymoore aren't as troubled as the film's disorderly manner, but
there's enough youthful talent on either side of the camera to make up
for it in impressive fashion.
Just don't expect a chick flick. `Girl, Interrupted' is rough around the
edges, and you aren't going to feel particularly upbeat when you leave
the theater. It's a character-driven drama at it's core, and there is no
chocolate coating that's going to erase the bitter taste in your mouth.
Sure, it's good, but it could have been better; the film falls victim to
the same syndrome that has plagued similar projects in the past. Instead
of constantly informing us about the characters, why not let us learn
for ourselves? But I'll get over it. Next patient, please.

Title
Review for Superstar (1999)
Some will confuse a movie based on a Saturday Night Live sketch for an
actual movie. In actuality, they are products which have been
precariously stretched beyond their usual 10-minute running length,
pampered and revamped to (barely) qualify as a feature film. Some, like
`Wayne's World' and `The Blues Brothers', fare moderately well with a
mainstream audience. Others (`It's Pat!', anyone...?) are so idiotic and
pointless that it's embarrassing to sit through even the skimpy 80
minutes of their nauseating running time.
`Superstar', the latest SNL related motion picture, actually fares
better at 82 minutes than in the suffocating confines of a 10-minute
sketch. I have never been a fan of the regular skit, which follows
Irish-Catholic school girl Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly Shannon)
through various escapades of quoting ancient TV movies and sniffing her
armpits during fits of nervous hysteria. But with a less claustrophobic
running time, some surprising attributes of Mary Katherine are allowed
to shine through: her unexpected charm, her sensitive personality... And
Shannon fits the role remarkably, applying just the right amount of
playful exuberance in some scenes and genuine feeling in others.
There are massive problems in `Superstar' from the very beginning, but
the appealing cuteness of the cast (along with an assorted handful of
fall-down funny moments) helps revive the quality considerably. The
painfully weak plot-line finds Mary, teased and taunted by her fellow
classmates at St. Monica's Catholic school, contemplating an entry to
the upcoming `Fight Venereal Disease' Talent Contest. She is also wooing
the incredible hunk Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), who holds the key to
Mary's lifelong dream: a great kiss.  Anticipating this timeless moment,
she has long practiced on several inanimate objects (including a tree
and a stop sign), much to the shock and dismay of the sisters at St.
Monica's.
For every joke or physical gag that works in `Superstar', there are
three that don't. There is also an emphasis on perverted sexual humor,
including one scene where Mary has her breasts engaged in a
conversation. Hidden in all the idiocy, there are isolated moments that
are just wonderful. Like Mary's bouts with the stuck-up blond
cheerleader Evian (Elaine Hendrix), whom she describes as the
`prettiest, most successful, most bulimic girl in school'. After the two
rivals attack each other with the kung-fu tactics of Jackie Chan, Mary
tells Evian to go `drink a bottle of herself'. There is also an
enjoyable send-up of `Armageddon', and funny sequences involving Mary's
hideously ugly pooch, which I wanted to confront with a large comb.
The entire cast is bright and funny. Will Ferrell, one of the most
talented additions to the current `SNL' cast, is delightfully
self-satisfied as the stereotypical jock Sky Corrigan. It's unfortunate
that Sky's character is left relatively unexplored, but whatever ground
Ferrell loses with that drawback, he makes up for with a funny recurring
appearance as Mary's subconscious interpretation of God (who advises the
Catholic girl to `get jiggy with it'). Glynis Johns is Mary's
wheelchair-bound gramma, Harland Williams is unusually sweet as a
mysterious and speechless drifter, and `Kids in the Hall' veteran Mark
McKinney supplies several gratifying moments as the bewildered Father
Ritley. McKinney can take even the most lifeless scene, such as when
Ritley chews on a blackened piece of toast, and revitalize it with
humor.
On the subject of `Kids in the Hall', it's also the original comic
origins of director Bruce McCulloch, who previously tried his luck
behind the camera this year with `Dog Park'. There's something absent
from McCulloch's direction, but it suits the subject matter nicely.
Undeniably, the real star here is Shannon, who originally created the
character of Mary Katherine Gallagher and deserves the credit where
credit is due.
Mary is certainly a clumsy girl (crashing through a confessional door in
one particular scene), and in some ways, the film embodies her
clumsiness. There's no reason why anyone would want to endure
`Superstar', unless they were a dedicated fan of `Saturday Night Live'
or Molly Shannon. But there are a few redeeming qualities - including a
contagious charm - that helps the film rise above a few general
standards normally associated with the `SNL' breed of movie-making. I
laughed during `Superstar', and if it catches you in the right frame of
mind, you might laugh too.

Title
Review for Bone Collector, The (1999)
`The Bone Collector' is a grisly serial killer retread that aspires to
reach the grotesquely unnerving high that `Seven' achieved with such a
controversial note in 1995. Filled with scalded, dismembered and
rat-covered carcasses, it's not a movie you want to experience right
after dinner. And while there are notable flashes of style and an
effectively dank mood that wafts over the proceedings like a dark cloud,
`The Bone Collector' dissipates into a movie that's more muddled than
frightening.
Study a block of Swiss cheese for awhile and you'll understand the basic
plot structure of `The Bone Collector'. The filmmakers are up to their
elbows in flaws, but they also possess the skill to craft a decent
movie. Early on, we dismiss the plot holes and try and absorb the
impressive style that director Phillip Noyce (`Patriot Games') has
injected. As time passes, however, we lose the ultimate grip on the
storyline. There's no effective movement after the opening half-hour;
the movie is strung together in a rather lethargic fashion by gory
shocks and mysterious clues. While it hits the occasional note of
interest, even perhaps fascination, `The Bone Collector' is a
disappointing effort.
What a good, solid actor Denzel Washington is. In everything from his
Oscar-winning performance in `Glory' to the terrorist thriller `The
Siege', Washington is simply superb. Playing paraplegic police detective
Lincoln Rhyme, the actor once again derives humor and sensitivity from a
character that would be lost at sea without his light touch. Granted,
the performances are not the problem  with `The Bone Collector'.  What
is? The constant utilization of preposterous plot mechanisms and the
lack of a solid spine-tingling mystery is a good place to start.
Detective Rhyme, bed-ridden ever since a near-fatal accident in the line
of duty, is called upon for his intellect to study the evidence in a
gruesome homicide. The killer drives a taxi, and when he picks up a
passenger, it's basically common knowledge that they're not going to
make it to their final destination. Yes, it's another one of those icky
serial killer movies.
After she shows some expertise at a crime scene, Rhyme enlists the help
of patrol officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) in the detailed case.
Investigating the aftermath of a bloody murder, Rhyme leads Donaghy
through the darkly lit innards of the New York City sewer system, hoping
to locate evidence and examine the nature of the killing. From the bed
in his apartment, Rhyme can do little more than bark orders toward his
young trainee. Working together, they could solve the identity of the
serial killer - even if the audience has figured it out a great deal
ahead of time.
That's my central grievance with the film. The elusive murderer in `The
Bone Collector' leaves clues behind that are merely genre clichés, and
he continuously manages to elude the entire police force despite their
best efforts. Is the killer incredibly brilliant, or is the police force
incredibly stupid?? The answer is a little of both. Despite such an
unwelcome number of plot holes, the film is darkly effective with it's
establishment of mood and slickly entertaining with it's presentation of
the facts. All of this... until the ill-conceived finale, which reveals
the identity of the murderer in a hammy and unbelievable fashion. It
feels like a cop-out ending that only exists in a cheap `Scream'
knockoff, where the killer reveals his motive in a strictly
connect-the-dots fashion to accommodate the audience. Even Washington
loses concentration, biting his lower lip in an expression that seems to
convey: `Damn. Who wrote this into the script?'
To be fair, both Washington and Jolie are excellent. The remainder of
the cast straddles the line between solid and obvious, with the
exception of Queen Latifah, who delivers a well-rounded performance as
Rhyme's bedside nurse. Michael Rooker plays the disgruntled Captain
Cheney, who wears a dastardly scowl and serves no purpose other than
creating conflict with the lead characters.
It's got certain promise, but `The Bone Collector' has an overbearing
tendency to lose focus. I would recommend `Seven' for a truly
frightening, gut-wrenching experience on a gloomy night. This average
entry is strictly for genre fanatics.

Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
`Fight Club' is the kind of breathless experience that chews you up,
spits you out, and leaves your senses jaded and disorientated with
exhilaration. It's a sublimely bizarre, starkly hilarious tale of an
underworld group of men who beat each other to a bloody pulp. But that's
certainly not the limit that director David Fincher and screenwriter Jim
Uhls have propelled the film to. The trailer would have you believe it's
merely a dark, disturbing guy movie.  Really, `Fight Club' tackles so
much more.
Fincher's astounding ascent begins right off the bat, when he takes us
through the barrel of a gun during the opening credits. The director has
showed incredible visual style in each of his previous efforts,
including his most recent, the labyrinthine puzzle thriller `The Game'.
Fincher has a knack for establishing mood and atmosphere, and in `Fight
Club', he breaks any and all barriers that could have previously
confined him. This is one wild and crazy ride; an adrenaline rush with
maniacal camera work that zips ferociously through the contents of a
trash basket, an apartment complex, and various other household
appliances.
This is the story of the socially-challenged Jack (Edward Norton), a
30-year old man suffocated by his job and badly suffering from a serious
bout of insomnia. Attending a self-help group for testicular cancer,
Jack is heartened at the fact that people feel sorry for him. He begins
appearing at these self-help groups on a frequent basis, until he spots
another `tourist': the ragged, chain-smoking drug kitten Marla (Helena
Bonham Carter). It just doesn't work any more for Jack. That is, until
he meets the glorified soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane
trip, and new possibilities are opened in his mind.
`Fight Club' is Jim Uhls' adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's acclaimed
novel of the same name. For the majority of it's lengthy 2 hour, 20
minute running time, Uhl's script has a delightful screw loose - one
that keeps the audience on edge as it twists and turns in several
unexpected directions. There are many details explored before Uhls
introduces the movie's central premise. During these moments, Tyler
introduces Jack to his method of personal liberation: old fashioned
hand-to-hand combat. After a while, this `fight club' begins to catch
on, and several new members are awaiting their turn to join in the
no-holds-barred face pummeling. There are only 8 simple rules. The first
rule: `You do not talk about fight club.' The second: `You DO NOT talk
about fight club.' Any questions so far?
At around the two-hour mark, just as `Fight Club' appears to have
exhausted every capably fresh idea in it's deranged little head, a
creative little plot twist comes into play. Is this twist at all logical
in any way? Certainly not. It's goofy but moderately resourceful, adding
fuel to a tired formula and ensuring enough palpable steam for an
appropriate finale. Some may compare this to the mind-bender of a climax
in `The Sixth Sense', but I beg to differ. Unlike that previous
late-summer smash, I was able to predict the unexpected `surprise' in
this entry (or at least detect a sign that things were not as they
seemed). Still, it's an interesting and strategic contortion of the
plot, and I admired the elaborate complexities of it all.
Around Oscar time next year, expect a nomination handed out to at least
one member of the lead ensemble in `Fight Club'. I vote for Norton, who
displays the perfect regulated amount of emotions, causing the narrator
Jack to aggressively appear as just a regular, average joe. But the
memorable centerpiece of the film is easily the offbeat, energized
character of Tyler Durden. Make a note: Brad Pitt has now shed his
pretty-boy image indefinitely, or, at least until he appears as a
typical pin-up hunk in his next film. Bonham Carter approaches the dazed
role of Marla with expertise, and there is also a modest supporting turn
from none other than Meat Loaf (who is credited as `Meat Loaf Aday').
The Loaf plays an overly obese man with gigantic breasts. Just thought
you'd like to know.
There is a graphic amount of violence in `Fight Club', but none seems
entirely inappropriate due to the nature of the subject matter. Fincher
corners the audience with darkly disturbing material, and the reaction
is - laughter? Yes indeed, and a healthy bit of it; the highlights
include a scene where Tyler and Jack smuggle several bags of human fat
from a liposuction clinic, with the intended purpose of using it as a
secret ingredient in the soap. If you think that sounds disgusting, wait
until you experience it in all it's fatty glory. Right from square one,
`Fight Club' is startling and darkly hilarious.
Of course, there is `inner meaning' hidden behind all the bloody
hi-jinks. For instance, why condemn yourself in the ugly barracks of an
average, everyday existence? Live freely, Tyler cautions. Few of these
moral messages successfully got through to me. But `Fight Club' delivers
a delectable helping of visual brilliance, original storytelling and
exhilarating action. This alone provides a prominent reason to see it.
So do it, before I get angry.

Title
Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
Starring-Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle,
Denise Richards, Judi Dench and Robbie Coltrane
Director-Michael Apted
Rated PG
For the nineteenth entry in his forever cherished franchise, James Bond
has pulled nothing particularly special out of his hat. At first glimpse
of the dashing new Bond girls, the wildly implausible action sequences
and the nifty Bond gadgets, dedicated 007 fans may dismiss `The World is
Not Enough' as merely same old. Fortunately though, in terms of
boisterous rollicking action, you still know what name to turn to.
In his third outing as the suave and sophisticated superspy, Pierce
Brosnan appears to be even more lightweight and comfortable than
previously evident. Cool and refined, he portrays Bond more solidly and
compact than any actor since Sean Connery. In the opening sequence, Bond
pursues a female sniper in an exhilarating boat race that covers water
and (*ahem*) land. Later on, he evades parachuting villains on ski-doos
while skiing down a treacherous mountainside (`See you back at the
lodge' he quips, as an unfortunate attacker plummets off the side of the
mountain). The action sequences and set-pieces of `The World is Not
Enough' are loaded with top-drawer inventiveness, bursting with
merciless excitement at every turn.
It also must be noted that the film has some mediocre aspects. The plot
is lumpy and uneven and certain characters are put to perpetual waste.
The plot follows Bond as he travels to protect Elektra King (Sophie
Marceau), the daughter of a deceased billionaire who was invested in the
world oil business. Elektra is believed to be the next target of the
devious Russian terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle), who has a bullet
lodged in his medulla oblongata that renders him completely impervious
to pain. The bald-headed Renard was voted the #1 Bond villain in a
recent pole. But despite the initial possibilities of such a cool
physical attribute, director Michael Apted ignores the strengths of
Carlyle's considerable talent, presenting Renard as a bit of a wuss. I
was hoping for more, to say the least.
Returning characters add spice to this unspectacular entry. Academy
Award-winner Judi Dench returns as M, and once again she positively
showcases the character's authority. Robbie Coltrane reprises his role
from `Goldeneye', playing a plump turkey of a villain named Valentin
Zukovsky, who's so likable it's hard to classify him as a villain. On a
more dramatic note, the legendary weapons-maker Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is
retiring after appearing in (nearly) every Bond movie since 1963's `From
Russia With Love'. The good news: he is being replaced by John Cleese,
playing the younger protégé R (get it?). Cleese is a funny man, although
here he is given only a few precious moments of screen and one or two
good lines (one of them being when he describes the attachments on
Bond's new BMW, adding it contains `six beverage cup holders').
`The World is Not Enough' is strictly formula Bond, granted, it's a
formula that is still fun. One great scene has the spy evading a
helicopter wielding three oversized buzzsaws. And of course, Bond is
given his usual quota of witty punch lines, all of which Brosnan
delivers in perfectly straight-faced fashion. One involves a nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who is apparently
only named Christmas Jones to aid in one hilarious bit of dialogue
during the film's closing moments. But Richards is one of the weak links
in this choppy adventure. I mean, she plays a nuclear physicist, for
cripes' sakes. Conveniently, she is the only scientist running around in
tight black shorts and an enticing green tanktop. While the actress (who
previously appeared in the risqué sex thriller `Wild Things') is
certainly fetching, perhaps her acting abilities aren't quite up to
snuff.
At one ludicrous point in the action, a younger viewer sitting behind me
had this sarcastic retort: `Yeah, right'. Boys and girls, Bond movies
are not about realistic action. They are unique thrill rides with daring
stunts and exhilarating chase scenes, often succeeding because they are
more wild and wacky than any other conventional action films. Stretching
the technological barrier, Bond has some nifty new gadgets here: x-ray
sunglasses, a credit card that transforms into a key... It's not to be
taken seriously, but it's fun.
Well, mainly. There is an element about these last two Bond entries (the
previous being `Tomorrow Never Dies') that drains certain excitement
from the premise. With this ingredient absent from the formula, `The
World is Not Enough' remains tasty, but ultimately it is lacking in a
few vital areas of humanity that were alive and evident in the classic
Connery films. For his next outing, James Bond could certainly use a
fresh canvas to explore something more different and exciting. `The
World is Not Enough' is entertaining, though, you've got to admit.
James Bond is certainly not dead. He simply needs some shock treatment.

Review for Evil Dead, The (1982)
`The Evil Dead' has developed into a cult classic over the years. The
idea was concocted by Sam Raimi and his college buddy, Bruce Campbell,
obviously when their beer keg had run dry. They set out to make a little
horror movie with a microscopic budget, out in a confined setting, with
a mere 5-person cast. I'm sure neither Raimi nor Campbell had planned on
the massive following that `The Evil Dead' has compiled since 1982.
The fact that `The Evil Dead' was produced with such a tiny budget only
seems to add to the fright factor. The movie has a dark, dank and cheesy
appearance that perfectly accentuates the plot of demonic possession.
And please, don't get me wrong, the anemic story line of the film is
flat-out idiotic. The material could have easily developed into another
perpetually retarded horror picture from the early 80's. But - with
Raimi's wonderful style and cunning approach - it somehow develops it
into a frightening, atmospheric and innovative bloodbath. Those looking
for a fun time of bloody cadavers, inventive shocks and corny special
effects couldn't do much better.
There are only five performers in `The Evil Dead' - a quintet of college
students who have slipped away for a quiet weekend at a rickety old
cabin in the woods. Ash (Bruce Campbell), Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss),
Scotty (Hal Delrich), Linda (Betsy Baker) and Shelly (Sarah York) are
mainly just the bunch of intellectually-impaired bimbos you would expect
from a horror film. After seeing something outside her window, one even
walks out into the middle of the woods to investigate. It could have
been a squirrel, but for whatever reason, the individual wanders into
the dark recesses of the forest calling `hello??' repeatedly. Movies
like `Scream' are so successful because they mock the horror genre with
such fun and accuracy. `The Evil Dead' does not revolve around
characters and dialogue. It's mainly about dismembered bodies, and
Raimi's ability to rattle our cages until we keel over like a petrified
sack of potatoes.
So, the five are living the good life until demons come and disrupt
their big party. Actually, the kids bring it on themselves, using a tape
recorder to play strange incantations which are supposedly recited by a
professor who previously stayed in the cabin. The magic spell awakes a
terrifying life force in the woods, and one by one the characters become
violently possessed by ferocious demons. Ash is left as the reluctant
hero, who barricades up every door and makes a last stand against the
demonic intruders.
Unlike it's two maniacal sequels, `Evil Dead 2' and `Army of Darkness',
this entry relies mainly on pulse-pounding horror. In that field, `The
Evil Dead' delivers in large, gory quantities. You may never want to go
camping again after enduring this relentless bloodbath of claustrophobic
chills. But, even though it's very subtle and hardly recognizable, Raimi
also injects a wry sense of humor to liven things up even more. There
are occasional moments that remind us, despite that `The Evil Dead' is
all in good fun. For instance, soon after poor Shelly has been hacked to
pieces (her severed parts still convulsing on the floor like gelatin),
Ash assures Scotty `we're all going to make it out of here. You, me,
Shelly.... well, not Shelly.'
While it may not be the bloodiest movie ever made, `The Evil Dead' could
easily register as the most disgusting. Scenes in which characters erupt
like pressurized tomatoes are repulsive and nauseating... not to mention
barrels of fun. You may feel obliged to lose your lunch during some
especially revolting bits. The one that caused my stomach to somersault
backwards occurred when a character rises from a buried grave, and rakes
poor Ash's leg with her fingernails (digging literally to the bone). Oh,
there's also the segment in which a girl is strapped down and raped by a
tree. That's in pretty bad taste, alright.
Campbell later evolved into a gung-ho heroic figure as the series
progressed, which was a lot of fun to watch, but here he is perfect. You
may recognizable Campbell from his prolonged stint on television's
`Xena: Warrior Princess' and a scene-stealing cameo in `Escape from LA'.
Sadly, little has come his way aside from the three `Evil Dead' films.
Campbell has an endearing everyman quality, and his delivery is brisk
and colorful, making him one of the more underrated actors of modern
cinema. Campbell's game performance and Raimi's tremendous direction are
the heart and soul behind the film.
It's not for all tastes, that's for sure, but `The Evil Dead' is a
highly enjoyable shocker for all who dare to grab their snorkel and
plunge in. Sam Raimi's delightful, dizzying camera work and imaginative
style help it prevail far over genre expectations. Why not rent this
diamond in the rough for Halloween?  It's one rare instance where a
tight budget actually paid off.

Review for Crow, The (1994)
The Crow has a basic revenge-style premise that is enlivened by great
production designs and cinematography. Director Alex Proyas plunges us
into an ugly, grim society where criminals do as they please and the
police are all but helpless to put an end to the massacre. The Crow
paints a dark and moody picture, but it is also one of the more
effective examples of it's kind in recent years.
As the movie opens, the police are investigating a double-homicide of a
nice young couple who were about to get married. Eric Draven (Brandon
Lee) was pushed out the window, while his fiancee was brutally raped by
a band of thugs who had broken into their apartment. He died instantly,
while she passed away after a long struggle at the hospital.
Flash forward a year to the startling awakening of Eric from his muddy
grave. Led by a crow who will serve as his guide through the land of the
living, he goes on a vengeful spree of wiping out those who were
responsible for his untimely death. He wears makeup that would put the
members of Kiss to shame, and leaves the outline of a crow at every
crime scene, whether it be in blood or a carefully laid ring of gasoline
to set fire to. I can't really elaborate on the film's plot, because
there's really no more to tell - this is your basic revenge flick with a
handful of unique qualities, just a new spin put on a familiar tale.
Just the same, the film's basic premise proves to be oddly moving.
Proyas knows how to set up a scene so that it will be easily absorbed by
the audience, and he's a master craftsman when it comes to the
choreography of action sequences. There's one monster shoot-out in The
Crow that will knock your socks off, as martial artist Lee proves to be
more than sufficient in a demanding physical scene.
Draven's trail of bad guys leads him to an underworld gang led by a
vicious crackhead (Michael Wincott), and his bizarre mistress (Bai
Ling). With the help of a sympathetic cop (Ernie Hudson), who finds his
motive to be more important than withholding the law, Draven finishes
off the last of the punks who crossed him and his wife. There are
flashbacks involving the couple's close relationship and home life, but
in most cases they are too brief or miss the point entirely. The biggest
thing The Crow has to brag about is it's spectacular set and production
designs, which bring to life this perpetually bleak city and practically
give it a life of it's own. Like in Proyas sophomore outing, the equally
impressive but intellectually superior Dark City, the surroundings play
just as big a part as many of the characters do. Another similarity of
the two films is the use of lighting. In both, any bright light
whatsoever is almost non-existent, and that only aides in the
effectiveness of the overall tone.
It's no question that The Crow will be remembered for the sudden death
of star Brandon Lee, who was killed during a freak accident near the end
of filming. This casts somewhat of a dark shadow over the proceedings,
but considering this film is already so dark there's little notice of
it.
The Crow is an impressive piece of gothic art, with a highly stylized
visual appearance that adds to the enjoyment. But it's little more than
that. The main character has but one goal, and after all the trouble is
over with, the audience will have indulged in the ride he provided but
never quite got entirely involved.

Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
   More MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton at:  http://welcome.to/movieviews
In Steven Spielberg's newest film, he demonstrates what the word war
really means. Utter, complete hell. And then he pits us there, right in
the middle of the most realistic battle scene ever experienced on
screen.
That scene is the landing on Omaha Beach, which starts off Saving
Private Ryan and then doesn't end for a painful and unquestionably
brutal 25 minutes into the movie. The deaths are not quick and painless
like in other war movies. Men have their limbs blown off left and right,
blood splatters in every direction, young soldiers lay on the ground
holding their own guts screaming for their "mommy", all of which sends
shivers down your spine.
Spielberg's three hour WWII epic is a masterful achievement that ranks
easily as one of the best movies of the year. But that doesn't mean it's
perfect. There are some moments when you feel the final impact should
have been more dramatically satisfying. But still, after two films (The
Lost World and Amistad) that I thought weren't up to Spielberg's average
quota, this one will set him back on track.
The Private Ryan of the title is one of four brothers fighting in World
War II. After the other three are killed in battle, a squad is sent out
to recover the remaining Ryan (played by Matt Damon) and bring him back
safely to his family. Leading the platoon is shaky captain Miller (Tom
Hanks, wonderful), and a loyal soldier who always sticks by his side
(the surprisingly commanding Tom Sizemore). Jeremy Davies plays a
frightened translator to such a stunning effect for a rookie player, and
the young cast shows they are capable of the most grating of tasks: to
hold their own in a Spielberg movie.
When the squad finally finds Ryan, 2/3 of the way into this three-hour
film, he turns out to be a stubborn yet likeable lad who doesn't want to
leave his platoon behind. This means Hanks and his team must stay to
defend one of the last remaining bridges from incoming Nazi's, in a
final sequence that is one of the most incredible scenes I've ever
witnessed on screen. The editing is marvelous, done to near perfection,
and once the smoke clears the final impact of the amazing battle will
stay with you long after you exit the theater.
Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films of our time, standing
strong next to Glory and Platoon. When Steven Spielberg has a vision, it
usually seems to work out. Unlike his mindless rampaging dino movie of
1997, this is a true vision. And it seemed to work out just fine.

Review for Die Hard (1988)
`Die Hard' may seem like an unusual choice for a Christmas review, and I
suppose it is. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a NYC cop who finds
himself planted in the middle of a elaborate terrorist situation at a
towering high rise in Los Angeles. McClane weaves his way through the
bowels of the building, navigating elevator shafts and various air ducts
with a machine gun slung over his shoulder and a bag of explosives in
hand. Plenty of terrorists are pumped full of lead, and a lot of sh*t
gets blown up. It's a great deal of fun.
But what does this have to do with Christmas? Here's my argument: all of
these events occur on Christmas Eve, and after this berserk
rollercoaster ride of mind-blowing stunts and white-knuckle action comes
to a close, the festive selection `Let it Snow' plays over the closing
credits. Pretty Christmasy, eh?
Just one refreshing thing about this influential action extravaganza is
the hero at the center of the action. McClane is not only a clever cop
able to evade oncoming gunmen in a constant game of cat-and-mouse - he's
also got a sense of humor. Leading the international pack of terrorists
is the cool and collected Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his infuriated
right-hand man Karl (Alexander Godunov), who is seriously PO'd at
McClane for killing his little hooligan brother. These guys have got a
lot of suave, professional tactics - not to mention a truck load of
impressive artillery. But even while he is constantly flirting with
death, McClane always has a witty comeback for his foreign opponents,
and Willis is fluent and enjoyable as he barrels his way through
punchline after glorious punchline. Stacked up, all of this makes John
McClane one of the most memorable action heroes to recently grace the
silver screen. Yipee ki-yay, indeed.
`Die Hard' is quite possibly the most efficient action movie ever
constructed. It's a red-blooded thrill ride, featuring components that
are perfectly in place, and it's flawless precision in capturing a
terrorist situation has been the basis for numerous clones and cheap
imitations that have since followed. Examining the layout of the film,
you realize this is how every action film should be assembled: with a
pace that never lags, characters and dialogue that crackle with
cleverness and intensity, and action that is both exciting and
believable. From just about every angle you examine it from, this film
is rollicking good fun. Upon it's release in 1988, although it wasn't
the inaugural example of it's kind, `Die Hard' set new and exciting
standards for the action/adventure genre.
I suppose, if there a noticeable defect in the film, it lies within the
supporting cast. And even that is admirable given the typical population
of stereotypes usually associated with the genre. Both Bonnie Bedelia
(as McClane's wife and fellow hostage) and Reginald VelJohnson (as a
fellow cop negotiating from the outside) are solid in their roles. Alan
Rickman, as the deviously sly terrorist Hans, is not only the best
villain in the `Die Hard' series - he's also one of the finest and
well-constructed in film history, a structural model for all other bad
guys to follow. Rickman, who combines dry wit with sinister
intelligence, is an absolute pleasure to watch. The bad news arrives
with the introduction of police chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason),
a pompous jerk determined to be an obstacle in every relevant matter.
The character is annoying, but Gleason plays it well. Afterward, though,
a pair of even bigger pricks - FBI agents, of course - arrive at the
scene and take charge with a stunning amount of incompetence. Add this
to a whiny gung-ho reporter (William Atherton), a weasily drug-abusing
co-worker (Hart Bochner), and a bunch of ornery terrorists armed with
automatic weapons....is there actually a likable supporting character in
the movie?
Of course, but never mind that little detail anyhow. `Die Hard' delivers
the goods in plausible suspense, adrenaline-pumping action, and
stupendous special effects to such a degree you almost beg for mercy.
Director John McTiernan has created the action movie of the century,
squeezing every ounce of possible excitement out of the premise, which
(in all fairness) is rather simple. It's the one to challenge....the big
kahuna.....the cream of the crop. And it also makes a great stocking
stuffer.

Review for October Sky (1999)
Everyone I talked to loved Patch Adams, and yet the critics completely
lambasted it. Here is a movie that I'm sure the movie-going public and
professional critics can agree on. They're saying that October Sky is
the first great movie of 1999, and they're right.
This is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young boy
in a small West Virginia coal mining town who is obsessed with
building a working rocket. His influence is the Russian satellite
Sputnik, a landmark achievement that he sees pass, consequently, in
the October night sky.  His father (played by Chris Cooper), driven by
generations of coal miners in the family, views Homer's rocket
chemistry as nonsensical and wants him to follow in his footsteps.
The only support Homer gets is from his friends and his teacher, Miss
Riley (Laura Dern), who eagerly assists him as his dream unravels.
Joe Johnston manages to press all the right buttons that a director
possibly could, turning this basic formula movie into an uplifting,
heartwarming piece of modern day entertainment. It's absolutely no
surprise that the movie is produced by the same people as Field of
Dreams. It's that good.
October Sky could have easily failed if everything didn't click
appropriately. The first mission was to get a believable actor to play
Homer, the young real-life hero who now works at NASA. This is where
the filmmakers struck gold. In casting newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal as the
teenager brave enough to follow his dream, Johnston made the best
decision of his career. Young Gyllenhaal is a sensational find, and
the movie simply glows whenever he's on camera. This puts everything
to rest, because he's in nearly every scene in the film.
Another wise move was to put Homer's rocky relationship with his
father ahead of even the main story. Cooper has a familiar role and
speaks familiar dialogue, but his situation is so believable that all
signs of deja vu are quickly pushed aside. Laura Dern is also playing
somewhat of a stock character. Her role may be the one weak spot the
film has, but in the same sense she performs very well with the
material she's given. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for
making this movie.
There's truly never an uninvolving moment in this two-hour gem, which
has far more than the designated amount of laughs and smiles needed to
register. If you're looking for something entertaining on a Saturday
afternoon, you couldn't do much better than seeing this. October Sky
is the best movie Hollywood has presented so far this year.

Title
Review for Muppets From Space (1999)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
Who doesn't love the Muppets? They're an adorable and colorful group of
furry characters that carry a certain charm wherever they go. Seeing
them in Muppets From Space, however, is somewhat of a letdown. Unlike
their previous outings, this sixth installment is poorly written and
choppily constructed, and Kermit and the gang can only go so far on
their own charm.
The Great Gonzo, the likable big-nosed whatzit we all know and love, has
been promoted from supporting player to lead. In a clever opening dream
sequence, Gonzo is fighting gusty winds to get to Noah (F. Murray
Abraham) and his ark which is just leaving for the long journey. When
Noah asks Gonzo what species he is, the blue Muppet is at a loss for
words. The truth is, Gonzo knows nothing about his family roots, and
Noah turns him away in confusion.
The plot concerns Gonzo attempting to discover what he is, and where
exactly he came from. His brothers hear the cries for help and send him
messages in his Alphabet cereal, and after a brief meeting with the
Cosmic Fish (`May the fish be with you!'), Gonzo realizes that he is a
deserted member of an alien race. Unfortunately, a paranoid government
operative (Jeffrey Tambor) in charge of monitoring extra-terrestrial
activity is also involved. He will stop at nothing to prevent the
landing of Gonzo's alien family, including destroying them for the
supposed well-being of America. Yes, it's another villain with
absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
This is not one of the better Muppet adventures. The plot is flat and
shockingly devoid of the clever screen-writing that always assists these
characters and magnifies their jokes. Once in a while, there is a
refreshing taste of what the Muppets stand for - cute, cleverly placed
retorts and innocent charm. But there is simply not enough to fuel a
ninety minute movie. The Muppets are a charming and sweet-natured bunch,
but not even they can carry an entire film without a sensible script
backing their every step. Kermit's better qualities are not on display,
Miss Piggy has been transformed into a kung-fu warrior who shows no
remorse, and even the Swedish chief doesn't speak as much nonsensical
gibberish as he used to. The Muppets still have potential, but this is
not the movie for them.
Another bonus of a Muppet movie are the enjoyable musical numbers, which
are unwisely discarded here until the final presentation of the 70's
funk hit `Celebration'. More toe-tapping songs and less draggy, familiar
plot additions could have been the recipe for a smoother final product.
The plot uses elements from Star Wars, Independence Day and Star Trek -
but usually not to the clever effect that we'd hope for. Muppets From
Space feels like a plastic-wrapped version of the earlier films that's
been sitting on the counter and drained of all inventive satire.
Keeping one tradition alive, there are numerous star cameos abounding
here. Brief appearances range from Ray Liotta to Hollywood Hogan, David
Arquette to Andie MacDowell, and so on. But none have the memorable
presence they deserve, and Tambor is wasted as the only big name star to
appear in more than a handful of scenes. The performers, both human and
puppet, try desperately to inject more spice into this pointless and
rambling excursion. But too much in the script is tired and formulaic,
including scientific devices like invisible spray, for them to have a
substantial effect on what sadly remains a sub-par Muppet outing.
Nonetheless, I am not entirely pessimistic about the future of Jim
Henson's marvelous creations. One poor script doesn't derail the entire
franchise, but it does raise certain questions. Perhaps the Muppets have
had their day, and even if their legacy finishes on a bland note, they
will always be remembered with a pleasant smile.

Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
Starring-Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack,
Todd Field, Marie Richardson and Rade Serbedzija
Director-Stanley Kubrick
Canadian Rating-18A
Released by Warner Brothers - 07/99
=93Eyes Wide Shut=94, the final theatrical effort of late visionary direc=
tor
Stanley Kubrick, transports the viewer through a dark, fascinating
tunnel of sexual voyeurism. Like a thought-provoking amusement ride
through a towering Gothic cathedral, Kubrick=92s closing bow plumbs the
innermost depths of the human conscience. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is a rare
psychological thriller that had my eyes feverishly affixed to the screen
throughout most of the 2 hour, 40 minute running time, all the while
pulsating with the type of technical brilliance associated with
Kubrick=92s name. Even the most simplistic conversation between character=
s
is given Grade-A treatment by the director - the lighting, camera
movement and background score all helping to sustain the impeccable
atmosphere.
To me, that is one of Kubrick=92s most impressive achievements: the
ability to create and maintain atmosphere. =93The Shining=94 is a stunnin=
g
example of his exquisite talent to mesh characters, plot and
surroundings into a total cerebral experience. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is
another one of these dream-like experiences. Upon its initial release,
critics and audiences stood at a decidedly mixed consensus. Some more
naive viewers, presumably unfamiliar with Kubrick=92s craft and brand of
filmmaking, went in anticipating more of a prototypical Tom
Cruise/Nicole Kidman romance vehicle. In turn, the somber, artsy
approach most likely drove them away sickened with humdrum monotony.
Others found the experience to be vague and meandering - posing the
suggestion that perhaps the concept and material was not worthy of the
great director=92s touch. Personally, I will offer high praise for the
visually and intellectually consuming =93Eyes Wide Shut=94. It may not
warrant a =91Classic Kubrick=92 stamp of approval, but =93EWS=94 is a hau=
nting
piece of visionary artwork, and certainly a worthy finale in a
phenomenal filmmaking saga.
Cruise and Kidman play Bill and Alice Harford, a wealthy New York couple
who, at first glance, seem to be at the peak of happiness in their
lives. We join Bill and Alice on the Eve of a party they are rushing to
attend, hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), a long-time friend of
the family. We watch curiously as Alice succumbs to the charm of an
older businessman, and as the two embrace each other on the dance floor,
openly discussing the meaning of marriage and whispering other
adulterous notions. Bill, meanwhile, is being tempted by a pair of
flirtatious girls who obviously want to lure him into a more private
sector of the ongoing party. More than a trifle vague, but interesting.
All of this subtle sexual cavorting leads to Alice, who - under the
influence of pot - reveals that she once considered an affair with
another man. Bill, confused, begins to prowl the moonlit streets to
search for some kind of redemption.
These events unspool into a surreal, engrossing exploration of
character, and it is here that Kubrick=92s visual genius really tightens
its grasp. Bill, a physician, encounters an old doctor-friend turned
musician (Todd Field) who reveals the secret of an masked underworld
gathering. After a brief stop at costume shop owned by a strange old
kook (Rade Serbedzija), Bill makes tracks for the bizarre sex convention
hoping to.... well, we don=92t really know. I imagine you=92re all famili=
ar
with this part. Yes, it=92s the notoriously controversial orgy sequence.
To escape the wrath of the dreaded NC-17, Kubrick was forced to trim
roughly 1 minute of gratuitous fornication and obscure a number of
protrusive body parts using shadows of onlookers (digitally added during
post-production). Some critics, like Roger Ebert, were quick to express
their disapproval of this MPAA intervention - arguing that Kubrick=92s
intended version would never be seen. These critics do make a valid
point.
But I want to skip easy jabs at the MPAA and focus on the film as it
stands. Two of the most captivating moments in =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 occur=
during simple character interaction. The first is the conversation
between Cruise and Field in a darkened bar. Every word, every syllable
is emphasized, and the incredible mood projected by such a customary
moment is definitive of Kubrick=92s magical ability to enrapture the
viewer over his career. The second moment is a chilling conversation
between Cruise and the convention leader, which just oozes atmosphere
and style, with lucid background music and tantalizing camera angles.
Although alone it may resemble a cat walking across a piano, the score
is of fundamental support. =93Eyes Wide Shut=94 is almost perfect from a
technical standpoint, and you already know what editing factor would
make it totally perfect.
No one other than Cruise and Kidman is given enough screen time for
register, but playing a pair of well-realized characters, the real-life
couple delivers. At times, our emotional link to the Bill character
wavers, and Kidman=92s vocal slurs occasionally become grating. =93EWS=94=
 is
also overlong, and some of the dramatic stuffing lacks real substance.
What I=92m saying is that =93Eyes Wide Shut=94, written with unstable
fluctuation between certain characters and events, is not the classic
cinema of =932001: A Space Odyssey=94 or =93A Clockwork Orange=94. But, a=
s he
places the viewer under his spell from minute one, we realize it may be
a long time before the realm of movie-making sees another rare genius
like Stanley Kubrick.

Review for Beach, The (2000)
Starring-Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton,
Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet and Robert Carlyle
Director-Danny Boyle
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by 20th Century Fox - 02/00
When I envision a beach, I think of an undisturbed sandy white plain,
with waves of glaciated water lightly caressing the shoreline in
peaceful transition. Leonardo DiCaprio's latest offering, vaguely titled
`The Beach', is nothing of the sort. It's more like a rocky terrain of
jagged frustration and unneeded obstacles, with the oncoming waves
pounding the shore with such force that the effect should be deafening.
Instead, it's nothing more than a repressed whisper. But enough with the
metaphors.
Unlike a large fragment of the population - namely younger females - I
do not consider myself to be a diehard Leo fanatic. I do concede that
the kid has acting abilities, which were showcased in a certain boat
movie involving an iceberg.... Oh, yes - `Titanic'. Given the incoherent
catastrophe surrounding him, DiCaprio's resolute performance is actually
one of the positive aspects of `The Beach'. Playing Richard, an American
boy wishing to seek refuge from the boring squabble of everyday living,
DiCaprio is believable and compelling. I wasn't concerned about being
properly persuaded by the actor, and he delivers sufficiently. Sadly,
Danny Boyle (whose work includes the maniacally macabre `Shallow Grave'
and `Trainspotting') offers no sign of destination in the director's
chair. After a set-up bubbling with intriguing promise, Boyle reveals
his movie serves no purpose. Perhaps after the first half of shooting
was completed, the director sat back to contemplate the question
`Sooo... where are we going from here?'
The script is weak and meandering, but at least `The Beach' looks
pretty. The story follows Richard, who hooks up with a French couple
(Guillame Canet and Virginie Ledoyen) in a cockroach-infested Thailand
hotel and goes on a mission to reach a secret beach. A map to this
supposed paradise was given to Richard by an eccentric Brit named Daffy
(Robert Carlyle), who commits gory suicide immediately following. Once
the determined trio reach the destination, they find 1) an enormous
marijuana plantation; 2) a band of willful civilians led by the
authoritative Sal (Tilda Swinton); and 3) an enclosed island paradise
unlike anything they've ever seen. This is where the seductive visual
radiance of `The Beach' really proves to be a valuable asset. Aside from
that, DiCaprio and a terrific soundtrack, the film is nothing more than
a pulpy mirage of lost meaning. Even through a series of weird and
supposedly profound events leading up to the denouement, I was unable to
determine the real purpose of `The Beach'. Perhaps I'm just daft, but I
was confused.
Some of Boyle's irregular humor helps matters....like a surreal sequence
that pits Richard, bordering on insanity, into a live-action video game
in the jungle. But unfortunately, all other vital aspects are drowned in
favor of the meaningless plot. The romance between Leo and co-star
Ledoyen is flat and uninviting. For such a fuss to be made over their
romantic connection, more sparks should have definitely been generated.
Tilda Swinton is quite good as ring leader Sal, but she also gets dealt
a character too conventional to be really striking. It all boils down to
the prettiness of `The Beach'. Those nice aerial shots of the lightly
tinted ocean, the glimmer of the sand once they arrive.... all this
photographic style and glamour seems to be in a movie different from the
murky final product.
Also be forewarned of the violence level, which is extreme, particularly
due to some of the grisly after-effects of a shark attack. At any rate,
the plentiful swarm of young ladies dedicated to Leo are going to find
squat to like about `The Beach' (save for Leo himself). It's also not a
film for those who enjoy inner meaning and moralizing with their cinema.
Although it goes to great lengths to achieve a purpose, `The Beach'
simply cannot find a satisfying comfort zone. Those looking for a
rewarding experience are going to be frustrated, so take my advice:
avoid `The Beach'. You'll find the waters too rough.

Review for My Dog Skip (2000)
There is a fine detectable line separating a children's movie from a
family movie. In a film aimed squarely at the younger crowd, there are
usually goofy physical antics, wisecracking sidekicks and strained
moralizing extracted from obvious universal issues. Sometimes this
formula supplies harmless entertainment, but the family movie experience
is always more gratifying when the filmmakers have envisioned no
particular target audience or age group. `My Dog Skip', a gentle and
cuddly boy-and-his-dog story, is a heartwarming tale of love and
sacrifice that will appeal to audiences young and old. For flustered
adults seeking redemption from another 90-minute live-action opus with
cartoonish villains and immature gags, `My Dog Skip' is the perfect
antidote.
One of the trailers at the movie advertised - God help us - `Pokemon:
The Movie 2000'. The original `Pokemon' grossed roughly $80 million at
the North American box office, and for what? Don't sink your money into
that inane animated cult. While viewing the trailer for the sequel, the
strict kid movie' siren went off in my head. I could already picture
the parents being dragged unwillingly to the cineplex to satisfy their
7-year old Pikachu fan. `My Dog Skip' is not this type of movie, and in
that sense, it is somewhat of a wonderful rarity: a film that is special
and rewarding for movie-goers of all ages.
I'm not a particularly avid fan of the TV hit `Malcolm in the Middle'. I
have caught the show on a few occasions, but I haven't allowed it enough
air-time to grow on me. The reason I'm babbling about `Malcolm' is
because that primetime success serves as a showcase for the young,
talented protagonist of `My Dog Skip': Frankie Muniz. Muniz, a charming,
innocent stringbean of a boy, seems to be making his bid for childhood
stardom by displaying his surprising range. Here, Muniz plays
mischievous 11-year old Willie Morris, a lonely boy living in
Mississippi via 1942. Unable to make appropriate friends with kids his
age, Willie looks up to his neighbor and personal idle Dink Jenkins
(Luke Wilson), a star baseball player who promises to teach Willie the
secret to a great curve ball. When Dink is called away on overseas war
duty, Willie's mother (Diane Lane) opts for a four-legged adoption into
the family - that of a terrier named Skipper. Despite the initial
objection of Willie's strict but caring father (Kevin Bacon), a war
veteran himself, Skip is granted shelter under the Morris' roof and
becomes quite attached to young Willie.
`My Dog Skip' is a sweet, touching adaptation of a novel by Willie
Morris himself, who shared with the world his tender childhood
experiences... including how Skip helped him to overcome his fears and
evolve emotionally into a young man. Director Jay Russell has crafted a
magical film that embodies the essence of childhood and captures the
special nature of raising a pet that you hold dear. Sure, the narration
(by Harry Connick Jr.) is occasionally plodding and unnecessary, not to
mention laced with distracting corniness. And the script has a tendency
to delve too deeply into its subjects to a point where the message
becomes preachy and sentimental. These are still minor drawbacks in a
superb family film... one that seems to be honey-coated with warmth and
inviting innocence.
I was surprised at how effective `My Dog Skip' was. It tugs at your
heartstrings gently, paying close attention not to venture into blatant
dramatic territory that insults the viewer's intelligence. Over time,
the soft, heartwarming approach grows powerful - resembling somewhat of
a strategically played game of emotional chess. I don't give in to
dramatics very often, but I admit I was getting a trifle misty-eyed
during `My Dog Skip'. The wonderfully honest performances only help to
enforce the subtle power the film contains. Bacon and Lane are both
terrific. Luke Wilson was a pleasant surprise, for in a rare dramatic
performance, he excels at everything that he usually accomplishes in a
comedy. There is a lot of honest discovery channeled through the
character of Dink Jenkins, who, in cinematic form, is a well-realized
addition to Morris' childhood adventures.
Frankie Muniz is the heart of `My Dog Skip', offering a thoroughly
convincing portrait of a lonely small-town boy with eyes aglow with
alarm and innocence. I'm looking forward to seeing him in future
projects. Concentrating on the present, Jay Russell's `My Dog Skip'
submits an early bid for family film of the year. Sure, it will likely
be toppled by a show-stopping Disney picture, but I'll hold a place in
my heart for this little wonder. `My Dog Skip' is something to wag your
tail about.

Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
Walt Disney has dominated the Thanksgiving movie season for many a year,
but since 1995, the prime justification for this has been their
collaboration with Pixar animation studios. The merging of Disney and
Pixar brought us the original `Toy Story', a computer-generated marvel
that wowed children and parents alike with it's astounding visual style
and instantly lovable characters. This last year, `A Bug's Life' was
released to a similar amount of prosperity at the Thanksgiving box
office. It seemed as if Disney and Pixar could never miss the target,
and the thoroughly delightful `Toy Story 2' is additional proof of that
fact.
I truly cannot imagine a more quality family film than `Toy Story 2'.
It's an endlessly imaginative visual feast, brimming with colorful
humor, endearing characters and offering a wonderful surprise around
each new corner. Director John Lasseter has crafted yet another visual
phenomenon, but it's also an emotionally fulfilling experience, guided
by a sure-footed approach that layers on the adventurous satisfaction.
For viewers of all ages (including adults with no child accompaniment),
it could be the most enjoyable cinematic experience of the entire year.
Lasseter opens with space ranger Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen)
battling the evil Emperor Zurg on a distant planet. This sequence is,
alone, worth the price of an evening admission. Meanwhile, cowboy Woody
(Tom Hanks) and the remainder of the toy gang are preparing for an
upcoming yard sale. During a rescue mission, Woody is abducted by a
deranged toy dealer (Wayne Knight) who recognizes the cowboy doll as a
rare collector's item. He stumbles upon surprising information about his
past: part of an ancient 50's television show called Woody's Round-up',
he rode a horse named Bullseye, romanced a pretty cowgirl named Jessie
(Joan Cusack) and was mentored by the wise old Prospector (Kelsey
Grammer). With the entire Woody's Round-up' gang in his collection, Al
the toy dealer realizes the set could be worth a pretty penny.
At time same, Buzz and company are organizing a search party to find
their beloved cowboy friend. Yes, all those lovable characters from the
original `Toy Story' have made a triumphant return: the irritable Mr.
Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger), the
cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney)
himself. As they travel across the city searching for Woody, it seems as
if each new visual setpiece is more amazing than the last. Just one
example is when the toy squadron attempts to cross a busy street,
shielded only by pylons to divert the oncoming traffic. `Toy Story 2' is
easily the most visually exciting movie of 1999; the human characters,
especially, are animated with an amazing level of delicate detail. They
look real, people.
This sequel is definitely on par with the original `Toy Story', and, in
several aspects, it surpasses it. No one in the audience should be
detached from the storyline for one minute. The humor is both clever and
thoughtful, as Lasseter directs with wonderful motion that had me
completely involved from the get-go. All of the actors are remarkable
with their voice-overs, particularly Hanks, Allen and Wallace Shawn -
who is all-too perfect for the voice of Rex and delivers laughs at a
rapid-fire pace. And, with an agreement made with Mattel, Barbie has a
cameo appearance in a toy store.
Family entertainment of this caliber is very hard to come by nowadays. I
applaud `Toy Story 2' for it's ability to present a mature and effective
story, and to generate so much excitement that is derived from
friendship and morals instead of conventional violence. I am certainly
past the age of watching movies about talking dolls, but this quality
feature is one of the year's best films. Here is one excited moviegoer
hoping that the collaboration of Disney and Pixar continues for years to
come. After all, no one is ever too old to play with toys.

Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
After the terminally bleak Reservoir Dogs and the brutally violent Pulp
Fiction, Jackie Brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure
for Quentin Tarantino. It's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters
that speak the Tarantino language. Luckily, his showcase of actors
convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen, and Jackie
Brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer.
The story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier), a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one
destination to another. She works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and
receives a minimal salary. But one day, she is picked up by a pair of
Federal Officials (including Michael Keaton as the tough-nosed Ray
Nicolet), and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of
smuggled dope. Jackie is working for a weapons dealer named Ordell
(Samuel L. Jackson), who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping
off the feds about their operation. Soon Jackie and Ordell are plotting
a way to smuggle $500,000 through to them under Nicolet's nose, with the
help of Ordell's oaf of a partner (Robert De Niro) and drugged-out lady
friend (Bridget Fonda).
Also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert
Forster), who takes a liking to Jackie and agrees at one point to make
the situation even more complicated (how I won't say). The big drop-off
is undoubtedly the high point of Jackie Brown, in which numerous
double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags (filled with
cash) switch hands. It's unfortunate that Tarantino takes his sweet time
getting there, and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while
doing so. There are, as always, amusing exchanges between characters.
The funniest repartee is between De Niro and Fonda, as he becomes
annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his IQ, or lack
thereof. The most interesting relationship is between Max and Jackie. A
56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant
with believable chemistry? You've got to commend the acting.
Jackie Brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine
acting. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours, 35 minutes. Tarantino's
talky style manages to hold your attention heavily, but there are more
than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline. Also,
fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear.
Jackie Brown has four major shootings, and two of those take place
mostly off-screen, so don't be expecting a typical Tarantino bloodbath.
You can expect frequent foul language, mostly coming way of Ordell, who
(much to the dismay of Spike Lee) uses the `N' word as part of his
regular vocabulary.
The acting is the glue that holds everything together. Grier, making a
sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's, is more than adequate for
the title character. In fact, she's flat-out great. Another comeback
comes from former TV star Robert Forster, who does a grand job as Max
Cherry, and is perfectly cast in doing so. Michael Keaton makes his
presence felt, albeit in small but dignified moments, and De Niro is
ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge. Speaking of that,
Bridget Fonda has relatively little to do as Ordell's bikini-clad beach
babe, and yet she manages to look fairly occupied.
There's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line
throughout the entire movie. Which is a life-saver for Mr. Tarantino.
The story barely holds together in the meantime, and we merely get a
small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake. But oh
well. Jackie Brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from Quentin
Tarantino, even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his
previous work. Let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us.
