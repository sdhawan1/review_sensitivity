Review for But I'm a Cheerleader (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/but_i'm_a_cheerleader.htm ---
`But I'm a Cheerleader' so profusely exaggerates its entire premise that the
picture crosses the line from being merely satirical of an already
much-satirized society to being downright stupid. The continuously
hyperbolic nature of the film would be offensive enough to draw complaint
from both homosexuals and heterosexuals but for the fact that such protest
would be dignifying the absurd and thus shedding unneeded light onto what
really amounts to no more than sheer silliness.
Megan (Natasha Lyonne), the captain of her high school's cheerleading squad,
is, on the surface, as spunky yet typical a teen as one could imagine. Her
parents love her and her boyfriend is obsessed with her. But Megan has a
secret that not even she has come to terms with: she is a lesbian. When she
kisses her boyfriend, she thinks of fellow cheerleaders; rather than
loosely-clad guys, her posters feature well-endowed women and when she sees
her pals with little on, her mind wanders into clearly homosexual territory.
Actually, it seems that Megan is the only one who isn't in on her little
secret. Imagine her surprise when her family and friends confront her one
morning and not only explain that they understand her sexual preference
better than her, because they have noticed her Melissa Etheridge posters and
vegetarianism (both, we are told, are clear signs of lesbianism) but that
they are sending her to an expensive, yet highly reputable, program called
`True Directions' to literally straighten her out.
`True Directions' is very much akin to Hollywood's fictional mental
institutions in that it sends a person to your house to pick you up, houses
its occupants in dorm-like buildings with little supervision and features
Clea DuVall (Georgina from `Girl, Interrupted') as its most attractive
female occupant. Like many Hollywood loony-bins, you can tell right off the
bat that the place is full of phonies. RuPaul, out of drag, plays Mike, the
head male counselor (actually, the only male counselor from what we gather).
Mike wears a shirt proclaiming `Straight is Great,' drives a pink van and,
at one point or another, goes through all of the stereotypically gay
movements. Yet, Mike insists that he is `an ex-gay' even though are
suspicions suggest otherwise. Those suspicions are confirmed when he gawks
at another male.
Of course, Mike is merely an example of the filmmaker's message: you are
what you are and nothing can change that. Megan is a lesbian, whether by
genetic predisposition or choice is irrelevant, and she will remain a
lesbian at heart no matter how much propaganda `True Directions' preaches
into her ears.
But it isn't Megan vs. The World or even Megan vs. Goliath  she does have
allies. To begin with, the program's leader makes the mistake of housing a
bunch of teens with raging hormones together  all of whom share the same
sexual preference  and hoping that the simple `no sex' rule will actually
be followed. Ha! Also, aside from her roommates' support, Megan discovers
what she refers to as the `underground homo railroad,' two gay men who
dropped out of the `True Directions' program and, from time to time, take
its current pupils out for a secret night field trip to `Cocksucker,' the
local gay bar. To and fro, they preach anti-conversion  the message that
director Jamie Babbit is clearly endorsing.
Yet, for reasons unbeknownst to this critic, Babbit feels the need to
further ridicule Megan's fictional `True Directions' by making it into the
ultimate stereotype training facility. The girls' dorm is pink, the guys' is
blue. The girls learn housework, the guys study auto-repair. And if the guys
misbehave, they have to spend the whole weekend watching sports. The whole
thing feels like something Lewis Carroll might have written.
The last few scenes of `But I'm a Cheerleader' exercise a set of clichés as
old as pompoms and ridiculous as Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri's Spartan
Spirit cheerleaders. But hey, given the ridiculous nature of the previous
70-someodd minutes of the film, the cast could have joined arms, formed a
chorus line and pumped out a rendition of `Springtime for Hitler' and I
doubt that anyone would be surprised.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/what_planet_are_you_from.htm ---
The ordinarily conservative Ben Kingsley, while playing an intergalactic 
leader, says "penis." Gary Shandling's character makes a humming noise 
when sexually aroused, courtesy of an artificial sex organ. A sleazy 
banker has intercourse with his supervisor in the vault. Find this 
funny? So do I.
Some planet, "way the hell out there," is attempting a universal 
domination bid by knocking off one celestial body at a time and earth's 
number has come up. (Now there's a new one!) Agent 1449-6 (Gary 
Shandling) is selected to lead the takeover mission by going to earth, 
assuming the name Harold Anderson and successfully inseminating a human 
female. (Another new one!) Blending in won't be difficult, however, as 
our out-of-town guest already has a human appearance - minus a penis 
that is. Yes, one of the keys to the all-male planet's domination is 
that none of its species can think with any head other than that lying 
firmly between their shoulders.
Anderson ultimately settles on Susan Hart, (Annette Bening hot off of 
her Academy Award nominated portrayal of Carolyn Burnham in American 
Beauty) a reformed alcoholic whom he picks up at an A. A. meeting. There 
is little shock when Susan finally becomes pregnant and breaks the news 
to Harold with a lame yet surprisingly memorable show stopping "High 
Hopes."
Because Anderson has neither pride to lose nor humiliation to fear, he 
makes passes at woman after woman from the minute he lands until he 
settles on Hart. This allows the film to use numerous hilarious pickup 
lines that put this summer's memorable "Suck me, Beautiful!" (care of 
American Pie) to shame. But the oftentimes offensive and always lurid 
cracks are overshadowed by the aforementioned reoccurring vibrating 
penis joke that stops being funny very quickly but continues throughout 
the entire piece. 
Like most alien-come-to-earth movies, the villain here is represented by 
a disgruntled government employee with a rocky marriage. (EDITOR'S NOTE: 
you can delete the "alien-come-to-earth.") Here the bad guy is Roland 
Jones (John Goodman), but he never achieves full evil status since you 
simply can't help but feel badly for the overworked government servant.  
When dealing with a movie of this nature, some reality must be 
suspended. Fine, aliens who travel quickly through space and blend in on 
earth can be bought. But some concepts aren't as easy to swallow. Isn't 
it odd that Hart is willing to repeatedly engage in sexual congress with 
Anderson even though his reproductive organ hums? What about the fact 
that very few people think twice about her ability to deliver a baby 
after only the first trimester? And if Anderson took some poor guy's 
job, where is the poor guy?
So, to recap, Gandhi says a naughty word, Larry Sanders can't control 
himself and Carolyn Burnham sings. Don't let your hopes be as high as 
hers.

Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
--- A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/girl,_interrupted.htm ----
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---
Girl, Interrupted is, on the surface, every man's dream: a bunch of 
crazy 20-something girls in a never-ending pajama party. Susanna, the 
film's protagonist and narrator, questions early on "Have you ever 
confused a dream with life?" Don't make the error. Despite having an 
uplifting trailer that seems to hit on every joke that is scattered 
about the film, Girl, Interrupted is a real downer of a drama that will 
do little more than confuse any horny male-chauvinists who mistakenly 
wander into the production.
The establishing shot of the movie is one of prison-like bars that 
slowly pans to some girls. This sets the tone for a film that takes 
place in a mental institution where the key character isn't a patient, 
nurse or doctor but rather the building itself. Susanna (Winona Ryder in 
a decent but not standout performance) is pressured into checking 
herself into Claymoore for what she is told will be a short rest. Before 
long, she is diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder in the 
pre-Prozac setting and finds herself staying a lot longer than she 
wishes.
Susanna's roommate is Georgina (Clea Duvall), a sweet, Wizard Of Oz 
obsessed pathological liar. Although the film doesn't explore her in 
depth, something that would be well worth the added time, Georgina is 
one of the most fascinating girls in the female-dominated movie. She is 
attractive, apparently friendly and seems to be totally innocuous. Yet 
she is in a mental institution and you find yourself questioning 
everything she says and, ultimately, wondering of her the same thing you 
wonder of many characters: is she really nuts?
Lisa (Angelina Jolie, who gives one of the finest female performances of 
1999 in her supporting role) has an in-your-face persona dominated by 
her escapes from the mental institution that one nurse (Whoopi Goldberg, 
who reprises her standard role as the caring mother figure) describes as 
"a five star hotel." It is apparent that Lisa is single-dimensionally 
psychotic, but you get a feeling that there might just be something more 
to her.
The other patients include a pampered girl who has sex with her father 
in exchange for rotisserie chicken, a burn victim with a profile ala Mel 
Gibson in The Man Without a Face and a bunch of overly nice nurses that 
subsequently lack credibility in fortunately limited roles.  
The story, based on Susanna Kaysen's best selling book of the same 
title, is more similar to The Graduate than other loony-bin films like 
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Susanna is like Benjamin Braddock in 
that she has no direction as she comes out of school and even has a 
sexual relationship (off screen) with one of her parents' friends. But 
unlike Benjamin, Susanna's parents give up on her almost altogether and 
she isn't nearly as naturally rebellious as Dustin Hoffman's landmark 
character.
The movie does venture slightly astray from Kaysen's book. For clearly 
dramatic purposes, Susanna finds herself in a creepy situation that she 
is only told about in the book. A pet cat that helps to define and 
humanize some characters is also added. And Susanna's life is only 
interrupted for one year here, compared to two in the book.
The film takes place in an era of Vietnam drafts, VW busses, RFK, MLK 
and Woodstock. A grade-A soundtrack is highlighted by pieces 
representative of the time including Bookends, Downtown, Time Has Come 
Today and The Weight. 
Girl, Interrupted is definitely a film that holds its own. A solid 
setting, intriguing characters and the aforementioned tunes make the 
movie well worth while- as long as you can take a PJ party seriously.

Title
Review for Hanging Up (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/hanging_up.htm ---
Georgia, Diane Keaton's character in the new film Hanging Up, says it 
best: "it's possible our father will never die." Audiences can 
sympathize as they groan through this 92-minute story of three sisters 
and their elderly, senile father. It shouldn't come as a surprise that, 
just before credits role, Lou (Walter Matthau) will pass away- it is 
what is expected. Unfortunately, what passes the time is no more 
entertaining than those telephone salesmen that always ring during 
dinner.
Eve (Meg Ryan), Geogia and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) are three sisters 
separated by profession but connected by AT&T. Georgia is the wealthy 
founder of a self-titled magazine, Maddy is a quasi-celebrity soap 
actress and Eve is a frazzled house-wife/mother trying to succeed in the 
business world via "No Surprises", her party planning company.
As Lou's health worsens with more and more incoherent references to 
"John Wayne's pecker" and death becomes imminent, Eve finds herself as 
the sole caretaker since only she is willing to set aside the time for 
her father. As phones ring all night, she exclaims "he's dead," always 
to be proven wrong. Where are the other two offspring of this divorced 
father? On the set and in the conference room.
Despite being directed by Keaton, Hanging Up is Meg Ryan's movie. Kudrow 
and Keaton, save their star-status, would only be considered extras 
during the first 80 minutes of the film. They are prominent at the end, 
but the production remains a vehicle for Meg Ryan as an actress and 
Walter Matthau as a supporting actor (who does very well in a role much 
akin to that of Jason Robards in Magnolia). Additionally, I'm not sure 
that Kudrow and Keaton's performances qualify as acting- they seem a tad 
too comfy playing pampered and strictly selfish blonde women.    
Traditionally, when making films where the ending will be marked by an 
obvious death, a secondary plot is added to keep the audience engaged. 
In the 1993 masterpiece Philadelphia, a fascinating and oftentimes 
gripping legal battle dominates the screen. Delia Ephron, whose freshman 
novel is the premise for the movie, obviously is not a Jonathan Demme or 
Tom Hanks fan as the death of Lou is the only saga here.
This script would probably never have been produced except for the fact 
that Delia's sister is Nora Ephron. Call her the Tori Spelling of 
writing, because this once respected journalist/non-fiction author will 
achieve nothing in the world of Hollywood's fictional films without her 
sibling's help.
Many people can sympathize with this tale of cell phones, car phones, 
portable phones, stationary phones and the family at the other end of 
them. That may well be the singular gleaming point of the film. 
Unfortunately though, at the end, the movie proves to be no more 
enjoyable than the resultant enormous phone bill.

Title
Review for Toque do Oboe, O (1999)
Often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right 
venturing into, The Call of the Oboe (O Toque Do Oboe) is a 
disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray. Many elements of 
the film are solid, and have potential far greater than director Claudio 
MacDowell will ever know, but they simply don't convert into a solid 
work.
Although a setting is never established, it becomes apparent. The film 
takes place somewhere in a Latin American village in present day. The 
community is a dull one, where every day is a downhill slide from the 
last. Over time, the people have taken to themselves. The town cinema is 
closed, no tourist has passed through in years, and the daily funeral 
processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger.
So what happens when a "tourist" (Paolo Betti) does arrive one day? He 
sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock. It is revealed 
that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby. When he sits down 
in the park one day to give a solo performance, the entire community 
gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years.
It is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers, and 
agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film, 
thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages. The woman that 
talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner (Leticia Vota) who 
also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector, a figure who 
soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this 
musician.
The rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly 
astray. It features a character who literally rises from his grave, a 
woman who has a phone conversation with God, and the aforementioned 
inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character, to an 
almost humorous drunk.
Technically, this film is a nightmare. The music score is poorly edited 
into the film, so it is often choppy, rough, and abrupt. The lighting is 
poor at best, which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many 
scenes, and the English subtitles are full of misspelled words, and are 
often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able 
to understand some simple Portuguese and Spanish phrases. This 
translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when 
what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue, but the 
subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words. 
In addition, the pace of the film seems uneven. It opens with a series 
of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience. The film 
then moves into a faster pace, that again slows towards the end, as the 
director seems determined to reach the two hour mark.
There was, however, potential for this film. It is a piece exploring the 
beauty of cinema and music, and the re-unification of people. These are 
all topics that could easily fill a movie. Perhaps, if there were no 
freak show, and the technical aspects were to improve, there might just 
be a thing of beauty at the end. Most importantly, though, the director 
would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two 
hours aren't such a bore. Until then, there seems to be little more hope 
for this piece, than that boy has by simply crying out "Mommy" while he 
wanders astray in a park.         

Title
Review for Whipped (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/whipped.htm ---
Brad (Brian Van Holt), Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams) and Zeke (Zorie Barber) 
convene once a week over Sunday breakfast to compare scamming notes from the 
previous two nights. No - they aren't credit card thieves, door-to-door 
salesman or even sleazy businessmen. They are "scammers" or, for those of you 
as apparently out of it as me, "swingers" or, for those of you who missed 
that educational 1996 film as well, they are what the parents of Generation-X 
refer to as "womanizers." Yep, the trio have Friday and Saturday night to get 
through as many women as possible or - in the case of one member with a 
masturbation obsession - come up with as interesting a set of stories as 
imaginable. There is a fourth member of their clan, Eric (Judah Domke), but 
he is two-years married and his encounters with post-marital sex - no matter 
how interesting (and some of them are quite exotic) - nauseate the group.
Oddly enough, the group's ventures are wonderfully entertaining in a very 
primitive, chauvinistic manner and should give single male audiences - 
especially those Gen-Xers with notoriously hyper-inflated egos - a great deal 
of pleasure to watch so long as they don't realize that they are laughing at 
themselves. Those who enjoyed other cheaply-made examinations of dating like 
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" and the aforementioned "Swingers" - both dignified 
cult-classics - should appreciate the biting reality of "Whipped" as the film 
examines how the three sleazy pals will cope with each other when they all 
fall for the same gal, Mia (Amanda Peet) and break the first rule of dating: 
"bros before hoes, pals before gals." And for those who envy the slick world 
of scamming, the film could, in many ways, serve as a starter's manual 
complete with a few sets of pickup lines and plenty of performance tips like 
how a man can enhance his taste to a female if consuming pineapple juice 
before receiving fellatio. 

Title
Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/tigger_movie,_the.htm ---
Slightly amusing and totally innocuous, but ultimately troubled, The
Tigger Movie proves that even the almighty Disney can mess up a
children's film. No, its not as bad as the mess formally known as
Pokemon and the non-summer/non-Thanksgiving release date should act as
a tip off, but Pooh and company are capable of much more than this 74
minute blemish on the legendary Hundred-Acre Wood.
The rambunctious Tigger is looking for someone to go bouncing with
(after all, that's what Tiggers do best!) when he manages to test the
nerves of all his pals, especially Rabbit. As it becomes obvious that
no one can bounce quite like Tigger (although Roo, the kangaroo,
certainly does try), Rabbit sarcastically advises that Tigger find his
family and go bouncing with them.  Taking these words to a literal
extreme, our protagonist begins the search for his long-lost family.
What the movie does have going for it is the unforgettable qualities
of its characters. Winnie the Pooh is the innocent and well meaning
but intellectually challenged bear. Owl is the wise and
good-intentioned but ultimately insomnia-curing owl. Piglet is the
adorable little pig who is light as a feather. Eeyore is the sluggish
and self-unimportant donkey that is cursed with bad luck. Kanga is the
single mother that every kangaroo would love to have. And Tigger is,
well, Tigger is T-I-double guh-rrr, Tigger.
Unlike the recent family hit, Toy Story 2, The Tigger Movie has little
to offer on any level other than that appealing to its five-year-old
audience.  The one time anything multidimensional is attempted comes
when The Brady Bunch, Rodin's Thinker and other non-pre-school
references are made in a chorus-line production that sticks out like a
talking tiger in a Lethal Weapon movie.
One thing parents needn't worry about here are the morals portrayed;
they are all family-value oriented. Roo, the little kangaroo, has only
a single mother, Kanga. Tigger occupies and mentors Roo by taking him
along on his quest and teaching him things like the
whoopdidoopersuperlooperallilooper bounce. Roo, in turn, cares for
Tigger and tries to cheer him up when his voyage is looking dim.
Although the trait has become synonymous with Disney films, sappiness
prevails a little too much here. The normally cheerful humor of
Christopher Robin's pals is weighed down by slow-paced songs that
clearly exist to 1) try to bring the audience to tears and 2) sell a
lot of soundtracks.
As I was leaving the theatre after seeing this film, someone asked me
if I thought it was a classic. After all, many Disney animated
features achieve that status and Winnie the Pooh certainly has as
well. My answer was "no" and, probably because of the hereditary
higher standard this movie is held to, that means it is a failure.

Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
A copy of thsi review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/toy_story_2.htm
Toy Story 2 is the perfect film to carry the Disney torch into the next 
century. Good old Walt's studio became synonymous with heartwarming and 
purely innocent children's fare during the last 75 years. Branches from 
the Mouse House like Touchstone and Miramax adapted to adult genres as 
well, making stirring and suspenseful dramas. This product of the Magic 
Kingdom isn't too lowbrow for adults nor highbrow for children; Toy 
Story 2 is the perfect family film and the happiest of all compromises.
"Back in 1995, retailers did not order enough toys to meet demand." Tour 
Guide Barbie speaks a truth that almost all of us remember vividly. 
(That was after Power Rangers and before Tickle Me Elmo.) It is no 
coincidence that this movie is opening twenty four hours before the 
year's biggest retail shopping day.
The original tale of the toys was a phenomenon. So was the original 
Austin Powers. Remember what happened when that sequel rolled around a 
few months back? It made more money in its first weekend than the first 
Austin Powers did in its entire theatrical run. And with Pokemon quickly 
fading after a huge opening, Toy Story 2 can expect enormous box office 
numbers, enhanced by retailers' ability to learn from their previous 
mistakes.
Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and the rest of 
the gang are all back for their next great adventure. This time around, 
the villain isn't the little boy next store, it is the big man with the 
toy store. Al (voice of Wayne Knight) spots Woody at a yard sale and 
realizes that our former hero is the missing piece to a very valuable 
collection. Soon Woody is abducted and living with the rest of the 
Roundup Gang, a series of dolls from an old television show that was 
canceled after its first week. Our new hero, Buzz Lightyear, jumps to 
the rescue explaining "Woody once risked his life for me. I couldn't 
call myself a friend if I weren't willing to do the same." He is joined 
by Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (voice of Jim 
Varney, Rex the dinosaur (voice of Wallace Shawn) and Hamm the piggy 
bank (voice of John Ratzenberger). Their mission entails a venture 
across town and should they make an error the consequences are obvious: 
"ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog" plus a couple of toys for the 
not-so-happy meal.
Pixar, the animation company behind this feat, starts the movie with a 
short film. In the immediate wake of Pikachu's Vacation, a rather 
unfortunate opening piece from Pokemon: The First Movie (of course, 
everything in that movie is rather unfortunate), comparisons must be 
drawn. Toy Story 2's opening is a cute and very short sequence involving 
two lamps and two balls. It is introduced at Pixar's first film from 
1986 (most kids in the audience will likely group that year and the 
stone age next to each other). Pikachu's Vacation is an original piece 
that drags on for some 20 minutes and is absolutely indecipherable. 
Needless to say that quantity isn't quality.
Toy Story 2 also thrives off of sheer eye candy. The animation is so 
real that you often wonder if it really is animation or some sort of 
Roger Rabbit-like combination of cartoons and people. This is best 
highlighted by the ending sequence which takes place at (Caution: 
SPOILER ahead) an airport and a mid-feature scene with a major highway.
The gang is back and better than ever, there is no question about it. 
Buzz Lightyear says it best, this film is headed "to infinity and 
beyond!"

Title
Review for Price of Glory (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/price_of_glory,_the.htm ---
Jimmy Smits' new film, The Price of Glory, a mawkish, overly poignant look
at family and boxing, is more like something a network would produce as
their Sunday night movie than a studio would put into theatres; such tired
clichés and poor dialogue have no business being on the silver screen.
Disclosure: I have never seen NYPD Blue, the show that made Jimmy Smits a
star. Perhaps he is a talented actor after all, but you certainly wouldn't
know that from seeing this movie. As a former boxer who rose too fast and
fell too quick, Smits doesn't look like an athlete. As a father grooming his
three sons for boxing glory with a blistering temper, Smits doesn't seem
mean enough. And as the ruthless manager of the aforementioned three
talents, Smits doesn't seem determined enough. Actually, it is rare that
Smits seems like anything other than an actor reciting lines while
simultaneously cursing his agent in the back of his mind. But that could
well be the fault of the script.
The screenplay for Price of Glory allows such pathetic exchanges as the
following scene between the Smits character and his wife:
All that is missing is a few weeping violins and a father/son conflict.
Oops! There is a father/son conflict. Actually, there are three of them.
Would you believe me if I told you one involved marriage and a fight with
the future in-laws? Rushmore's Max Fisher would be proud.
Fortunately, there is some good to justify this being a decent Sunday night
movie. The boxing footage is amazing. Much like the recent Play it the Bone,
the filmmakers here seem to have put all their efforts into making the
in-the-ring scenes memorable. They succeeded as every blow is exhilarating
and every jab exciting, but there is too much out-of-the-ring action to
justify solely judging the movie on punches and flying sweat.
Ironically, it seems that the only parts of the film properly edited are the
complex boxing sequences. Numerous moments that cut back and forth between
two camera angles have significant continuity flaws. There is no better
example than a mid-film date scene where characters' positions seem to jump
around even though they don't seem to be moving. The only excuse for such
flaws is someone believing they were blocking the scenes with a more
forgiving TV screen in mind.
The film's finale, although certainly no Rocky, is mediocre. But mediocrity
projects an appearance of brilliance when following such poor work as the
film's beginning. Most of the boxing footage finds itself in these last few
moments and the dialogue is limited enough that audiences might actually
exit the theatre with a cheaply placed grin on their face. This doesn't make
up for the clichés, script or Jimmy Smits however. But then again, nothing
could.

Review for Civil Action, A (1998)
"I'm going to do something really outrageous. I am going to tell the 
truth." So proclaims John Travolta in his last film, Primary Colors. 
Kind of ironic that he went from that role, to playing a lawyer in his 
new film, A Civil Action, don't you think? Oh, but worry not Travolta 
fans because he gives what is his second Oscar caliber performance of 
the year in this remarkable film. And his acting, no matter how great, 
is little more than one of the many achievements in this exceptional 
film that is based on a true story.
Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) is the type of personal injury lawyer 
that makes you disgusted with the American legal system. He is as much 
an ambulance chaser as the next lawyer, and doesn't seem to have, well, 
morals. His theories are real simple: a dead child is worth very little, 
a dead woman or minority is worth very little, but a dead middle aged 
man is what he thrives off. And thrives he does, he wears a custom made 
suit, drives a Porsche, and seems to be at the peak of his legal career. 
And then he stumbles onto the lawsuit that could make him millions and 
earn him immortality. A company that makes billions of dollars every 
year, and seems to have all the money in the world, has been polluting 
the water supply in Woburn, Mass. This had lead to the pre-mature deaths 
of numerous children, and their families are looking for an apology.
To Schlichtmann an apology is a very simple thing: money. He sees a gold 
mine and seizes the opportunity, despite his long-standing belief that 
children don't equal money. Working with him in his firm are Kevin 
Conway (Tony Shalhoub) and James Gordon (William H. Macy). The 
opposition consists of 2 very different lawyers. On one side there is 
William Cheeseman (Bruce Norris) who seems to be the inexperienced, over 
excited, and incompetent one in the mix. Then there is the wise, 
educated, relaxed and overall brilliant Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) 
who is as much a Red Sox fan as anyone else in Boston. It will be these 
2 men vs. Schlichtmann and company in what will be the case of their 
careers.
The brilliance to this plot is that it is real. (WARNING: PLOT GIVEAWAY) 
And, as in real life, the story doesn't have a happy ending. It is a 
tragic courtroom film, which is something that is very rare for 
Hollywood. It is also one of the few courtroom films that does not 
involve a female love interest, another rarity. And, because of that, 
this movie really does shine.
The acting is nothing less than brilliant. John Travolta gives the 
second great performance of his career (Primary Colors, where he also 
had the task of portraying a real person) and has finally given reason 
for people to stop asking about his capability. And Robert Duvall gives 
what is just another spectacular job from an actor who is among the 
greatest. But the real treat is William H. Macy who seems to be giving 
role after role of great acting. He gives this movie a whole different 
angle through a unique blend of comedy and drama that only he is capable 
of. You will also find a very good job by John Lithgow as Judge Skinner, 
and a wonderfully charming cameo by Kathy Bates at the end of this 2 
hour film.
When all is said and done, you walk out of a spectacular film that stuns 
you as much as it entertains. Through great acting, a spectacularly true 
story, and an overall willingness to dare, A Civil Action is a great 
achievement. May it be marked as one of the few films of 1998 that was 
truly great.

Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
A powerful and unforgettable film, Spike Lee's Summer of Sam is, to 
date, the best drama of 1999. The chief feature of the production is its 
background setting, one so intriguing that it is capable of being an 
entire plot: New York City in the summer of 1977. By adding a 
fictionalized subplot putting several characters under a magnifying 
glass, the film is able to not only use these rich events, but a study 
of human paranoia resulting from them as well. The movie uses these 
great settings and shockingly forthright violence to tie these plots 
together so well.
In the summer of 1977 New York City had a heat wave bringing 
temperatures well over 100 degrees, the Yankees were on there way to a 
world series victory led by Reggie Jackson's three dramatic home runs, 
a blackout occurred that put the city that never sleeps in a zombie-like 
state for days, and the city's first genuine serial killer, David 
Berkowitz, calling himself "Son of Sam," roamed the streets preying on 
innocent young women.
As the temperatures rise, and the body count increases, a certain 
insanity comes about the city that is only further stimulated by the 
other events. Spike Lee's fictionalized group of characters from the 
Bronx, led by Vinny (John Leguizamo) slowly fall victim to the paranoia 
that a serial killer presents, and seek a scapegoat to reassure 
themselves of their safety. Using fractured logic they reach the 
conclusion that this murderer, whoever he may be, must be from their 
neighborhood. So a list of everyone they consider to be a weird-o is 
drawn up, and at the top of their list is aspiring punk rocker Ritchie 
(Adrien Brody) who soon becomes the subject of continuous persecution 
from the group.
Son of Sam (Michael Badalucco) actually has less than 15 minutes of 
screen time in this production. The time that he is on screen proves to 
be some of the most horrifying and frightening moments of the entire 
film. Every murder he commits during the movie is shown with explicit 
detail for a period of time just long enough to make it sink real deep 
inside of you. Not once during any of these beautifully choreographed 
murders do you see the killer's face, just those of people realizing 
that they are about to lose their lives.
Summer of Sam also features a strong sexual content aside from the 
violence and obvious use of foul language. Several scenes focus on 
conversations regarding oral sex techniques, and styles. One scene 
includes three-way sexual activities. Being that a subplot of marriage 
problems with Vinny and his wife (Mira Sorvino) comes about, this 
otherwise excessive sexual content is actually a building block of the 
film's excellence.
The production includes an incredible panoply of background settings and 
musical pieces. Scenes range from the streets of New York to Studio 54, 
with music from groups like ABBA to Elton John. The film also uses a 
delightful contrast technique using upbeat music as the murders take 
place, creating an incredible chill.
When David Berkowitz announced that he had received orders to kill from 
a dog, people were equally shocked and amused. He had been a strong 
presence in New York City for over a year, and that was his reasoning. 
Comparatively, Summer of Sam is both shocking and entertaining, making 
it a strong presence and great film at the same time.

Title
Review for Angela's Ashes (1999)
"When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how my brothers and I 
managed to survive at all" is the first line of Angela's Ashes. As 
people look back on this film they too will wonder how they ever 
survived. The movie's biggest flaw is that the two and a half hour 
duration goes at the rate of a Leslie Nielson death scene. Misery does 
love company and this examination of Irish misery finds plenty of 
company so as not to leave this one aching flaw alone.20
Angela's Ashes must know just how uninteresting it is. There is no other 
explanation for what transpires in the first 30 minutes: three children 
die; the filmmakers resort to this oldest, most melodramatic technique 
not once, but three times. Then, as if the movie realizes that there are 
only so many characters who can pass away, the work ventures away from 
the morbid and tries to find a plot. But there is none to be found; so 
the deaths resume, just at a slower rate. Filling the now-longer gaps is 
Hollywood's second oldest emotional stunt: The Alcoholic Father.
Despite being absent a plot, Angelas Ashes does have a setting: Ireland 
during a time when students could openly ponder "What use is Euclid when 
the Germans are bombing everything in sight?" The production centers 
around a young boy and his family. The mother, Angela (Emily Watson who 
is far too plump for this poverty-stricken role), has no qualms with 
picking coals off the street to warm her often-sick family members. The 
father, Malachy (Robert Carlyle who's acting is quite possibly the only 
good part of the movie, even if it is just a reprisal of his role in the 
acclaimed The Full Monty) thinks otherwise, insisting "We're not 
beggars" and scolding "You have no pride, Angela." In reality, he is the 
one without pride who begs for money not to cloth his family but to 
provide the almighty "pint." On one occasion the narrator, Frank, 
comments of his father "A man who drinks the money for a new baby has 
gone beyond the beyonds." Get the picture? Good. That was 140 minutes in 
one paragraph. (And my editor says I'm not concise enough!)
Those not familiar with the IRA, Oedipus and "The Consumption" might 
struggle with what little this highbrow film has to offer. Those who 
prefer popcorn during their trips to the cinema might struggle with a 
guilt trip. Those fans of Monet might struggle to have any appreciation 
for a re-occurring scenery shot clearly ripped out of one of his 
paintings. Those of the non-anarchist persuasion might struggle with the 
film's anti-debt moral. Those with limited or even normal attention 
spans will struggle with the movie's length. Those that enjoy good films 
will struggle with the overall lack of quality. These struggles are not 
nearly as bad as the poverty depicted in Angela's Ashes, but there still 
is no reason to voluntarily subject yourself to them, much less pay for 
them.

Title
Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.---
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/the_hurricane.htm
First he wrote a book about it. Then Bob Dylan wrote a critically 
acclaimed song about it. Now Academy Award winning director Norman 
Jewison and Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington have a made a 
movie about it. The man is Rubin "Hurricane" Carter and the story is one 
of such power that it puts the knock-out punches he delivered as a prize 
fighter to shame.
"Here comes the story of the hurricane." (Did you really think I would 
make it through this review without quoting Bob Dylan?) Rubin Carter 
(Denzel Washington) was the champion of the world, having lost but a 
handful of fights and delivering forceful flurries of punches that would 
floor his opponents. But he was also black, something that didn't 
stand well in the eyes of a certain police officer (Dan Hedaya). When 
two black men wreak murderous havoc on a bar one night in the 1960's, 
Hurricane and another man soon find themselves in prison for a crime 
they didn't commit. The film ventures away from the other man and 
focuses on Hurricane; his way of coping with prison ("innocence is 
highly overrated commodity"); his refusal to give in ("I've committed 
no crime. A crime has been committed against me") and his eventually 
giving up ("I'm dead. Just bury me please"). Then, when hope was all 
but lost, a young and once underprivileged black boy, being raised and 
schooled by an upper-middle class Canadian family, stumbled upon the 
aforementioned autobiography. With the help of his new Canadian family, 
Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) looks to free the champion of the 
world in the biggest fight Hurricane will ever step into .
The Hurricane spends little time on Rubin Carter's childhood and 
instead focuses intensely on the very interesting time he spent in the 
boxing ring, in prison and in court. Boxing brings enjoyable sporting 
moments, while prison offers deep intellectual insights and court 
provides (SPOLER!!!) a heartbreak early-on and a sure-to-make-you-smile 
moment at the film's end.
Most of the film is spent in prison, however. Recently, The Green Mile 
painted a particularly rosy and black and white view of jail with 
extraordinarily kind guards and inmates minus the few rotten apples who 
are 100% rotten. Here things are more complex: some guards are nice, 
some are cruel and one particularly kind inmate professes wicked ways. 
But Hurricane isolates himself from the beginning when he gets 90 days 
in the hole for refusing to wear prison-issued garments.
Denzel Washington gives yet another kick-ass performance in a year when 
many great acting jobs will unfortunately lack recognition due to high 
quantity. The supporting cast also comes up strong with Dan Hedaya as a 
bigoted police officer and youngster Vicellous Reon Shannon as a 
curiosity driven, justice seeking boy in the champ's corner.
Simply put, The Hurricane is a knock-out punch.

Title
Review for Whatever It Takes (2000)
--- A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/drowning_mona_and_whatever_it_takes.htm ---
Several nights ago I was forced to make a decision between attending a
screening of a) Drowning Mona or b) Whatever it Takes. My choice
wouldn't make much difference as I was destined to view both, so I
nonchalantly chose b. In retrospect, I should have opted for c) a warm
bath and a good night's sleep.
Drowning Mona, the third pathetic excuse for a movie from Destination
Films (Bats and Eye of the Beholder), has a very-much recognizable
cast that you expect to deftly guide it through what sounds like a
semi-intriguing plot.  Whatever It Takes, comparatively, comes from
the veteran Columbia pictures and features a bunch of no-names in a
very-much tired plot.
Danny DeVito hunts down the murderer of Verplank, New York's town
shrew in Mona while Shane West seeks a prom date at Gilmore High in
Whatever it Takes.  It has been a while since a who-didn't-do-it has
come along, so Mona certainly had the potential to be refreshingly
amusing. Unfortunately, as the list of Fargonian characters piles up,
it becomes increasingly apparent that the film's payoff cannot make
sense as not a single member of the all-inclusive suspect list has the
intellectual capacity to execute a murder.  I dare even say that the
only people dumber than the citizens of Verplank are the graduating
class of Gilmore High. The characters in Whatever it Takes are so
flagrantly single-dimensional that a quasi-Pleasantville feeling is
created.
Insuring that Drowning Mona dies a worst death than the one described
in its title are Danny DeVito, Casey Affleck, Bette Midler and Neve
Campbell.  DeVito likely won't suffer too badly from picking this film
as he can still be seen in the extraordinary Man on the Moon and has
an extremely respectable career to overshadow this work. Midler, on
the other hand, is fresh off of Isn't She Great (which isn't) and
needs to take a serious look at the current state of her career. It
has been nearly 10 years since the landmark in her vitae when she bid
Carson goodbye and although she continues to do acclaimed live
theatre, her film career seems to have nose-dived since that Memorial
Day weekend. As for Affleck and Campbell, they are both newcomers who
will have to fight to erase memories of Mona, but given their talent
they will likely succeed.
Whatever it Takes features Shane West and Marla Sokoloff as the
resident geeks who attempt to cross-date with the two most popular
kids in school, played by James Franco and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Sokoloff,
West and Franco will all likely be destroyed by this
play-it-by-the-convenient-cliché production.  As for O'Keefe, the
only actor with any experience to speak of (except for the always cute
Julia Sweeney in a supporting role), she will likely come away
stereotyped as the teenage bitch until she can no longer stop playing
a teenager, at which point the only line she'll have to remember is "Would
you like fries with that?"
For Mona, the kiss of death comes in a mid-film knife-throwing contest
when the tempestuous character is humanized. The second you feel
remotely bad for the deceased, the film goes from being really awful
to really really awful.  For Whatever it Takes, the unoriginal plot
mixed with the apparent inability to land a singly joke doom the
production for expulsion from the ranks of decent cinema.
Forget a hot bath and good night's sleep. I would have rather bathed
in an Alaskan lake and spent a the night with the Adams Family than
suffered through either of these movies!

Title
Review for Mobutu, roi du Zaďre (1999)
---This review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/mobutu,_king_of_zaire.htm ---
There has long been a rumor that Mobutu Sese Seko staged random executions
of prisoners before 1972's Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between
Mohammed Ali and George Foreman. But you won't hear about that in Mobutu,
King of Zaire, a two-and-one-quarter hour documentary that seems to select
what it includes and what is excludes similarly to how Mobutu supposedly
selected the doomed prisoners. What the documentary does reiterate time and
again is that Mobutu was a beast  inhuman, amoral and money-hungry. To get
this point across, almost all references to the Zairian leader's family are
left on the editing room floor (a good director like Thierry Michel couldn't
humanize his untamed beast). Still, agenda or not, Michel has picked a
fascinating subject. Mobutu united, led and, ultimately, destroyed his
people in the name of money and power. At one point, in an old interview,
the leader points out the obvious when speaking in the first person:
`President Mobutu's fortune is greater than Zaire's debt.' So why was this
man capable of leading a country without rebellion for so long? `He had
become a god' wisely remarks an interviewee (although the infamous Chinese
system of making citizens ask for a different color ballot should they not
want to vote for their current leader couldn't have hurt). And that is
really the extent of the film: how many awful things this `god' did. Before
the end, you will see people hung, people beaten to death and other graphic,
haunting images. You will hear of even more, like when the leader apparently
drank a glass of human blood in hopes that it would make him more powerful.
It gets tired quickly. What doesn't, however, is Larry Delvin, one of the
interviewees. The former CIA chief in Zaire, Delvin reveals that the USA had
a way of physically terminating reigns of leaders that displeased
Washington. Fascinating as the CIA and Mobutu's wrath may be, the
anti-Mobutu propaganda rises to a level that takes the piece well beyond
most documentaries in terms of a slanted perspective. Perhaps that is where
the answer can found: Michel couldn't show America's favorite retired boxer
in a film about unadulterated evil, now could he?

Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
Teenagers have a lot of power in Hollywood. Every year countless films 
will be made targeting that audience in particular, and rely on the 
entire teenage population to turn out on Friday and Saturday nights, 
wallets in hand. The formula is very simple, you make a film with a big 
name young actor or actress with sex appeal. You add a high school 
environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds, 
and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 
90 minutes, the typical teenage attention span. The response is enormous 
as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any =
film set in an environment they can relate to, and, most importantly, 
they don92t care to judge films=92 quality, so any piece of trash will =
due. That is just what Never Been Kissed, the latest film from director 
Raja Gosnell, is; trash.
Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is the youngest copy editor in the history 
of the Chicago Sun Times. She has her own personal assistant, unlimited 
supplies, and her own office. But she is very much dismayed with her 
position in life. There is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter 
and go out into the field, where she can play a more active role in the 
Chicago media. So when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her 
out of nowhere, she jumps at it with elation.
Constantly smothering Josie in the work place is her friend Anita (Molly 
Shannon) and her amicable superior, Gus (John C. Reilly). The two of 
them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first 
assignment, as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a 
reporter. However, since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with 
little patience for character conflict, this otherwise interesting 
scenario is resolved within two minutes, and Josie is headed for the 
field.
Obviously, the field assignment involves a high school. Specifically, 
she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school, by enrolling 
in the senior class and "becoming one of them." I don92t think that I =
need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation 
ever occurring, so I won92t.
The movie develops into Josie trying to find the life that she never led 
in high school. Interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a 
dork she truly was, and she appears to be heading down that road again. 
Fortunately for this lame production, other characters do appear that 
make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely 
interesting. They include the predictable love stories, between both a 
student (Jeremy Jordan) and a teacher (Michael Vartan), to show that 
Josie is really two people in one body. Also, her younger brother and 
opposite, Rob (David Arquette) comes into her new found life and even 
causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative.
The humor found in this film is actually quite amusing. Typical for 
teenage films, it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor. 
One scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving 
bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical. Most of the other jokes 
are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to 
high school can appreciate and will enjoy. But those still don92t =
recover for the total lack of quality in this movie.
Following this trend of high school movie rules, comes the general 
acting. It is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from 
film to film. In this case, Drew Barrymore is absolutely painful to 
watch. She is required to play her character on two levels, having some 
very black and white transitions. And although some scenes are written 
to be particular shades of gray, she seems to hold that color throughout 
all of her screen time. At one point she is alone with an obvious love 
interest on a Ferris wheel, and is expected to him on an adult level, 
since he is one, her teacher. But she never seems to get out of the gray 
area, and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good 
performance.
Following Barrymore is the pitiful Molly Shannon (Saturday Night Live). 
She seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can 
relate to, and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic. 
It is these "qualities" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene 
from being one of the few decent.
Luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise 
bleak film. David Arquette (Scream) takes home the prize for being able 
to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic, and 
not have his brilliant acting ruined. And as a central character he gets 
to take on his own mini-plot, which is one of the few well done parts of 
Never Been Kissed. In a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of 
work, he does an absolutely hilarious Tom Cruise impression from the 
1983 hit, Risky Business.
Never Been Kissed is a mediocre film at best. The predictable plot has 
become so overplayed in Hollywood, that it is sickening to watch time 
and again, and this film is no exception. The acting is just as bad, but 
there is the one positive presence of David Arquette to add some light. 
Unfortunately, the bottom line is that the movie will be a success, 
because teenagers will pay to see any trash.

Title
Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
Available for Rental - October 12, 1999
10 Things I Hate About You is an update of the classic play, The Taming 
of the Shrew. That said, drop any pre-conceived notions of what 
Shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to 
Padua High School, home of a student counselor (Allison Janney) who 
obsesses over the male penis; a slightly too hip and racist 
African-American English teacher (Daryl Mitchell); a new kid named 
Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a model named Joey (Andrew Keegan), the 
subject of Cameron and Joey's crushes; Bianca (Larisa Oleynik); and 
Bianca's sister - the shrew (Julia Stiles in a marvelous 
performance)- whose name is Katarina, Kat for short.
With movies about high schools similar to these running through 
projectors like water down the Nile, it would be quite easy to write off 
10 Things I Hate About You as just another doltish comedic-romance. Yet, 
you must realize that the story is timeless, and a few hundred years 
later it is equally as witty and comical as when Elizabeth gleefully 
looked on, groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage.
The first reminder of the original scribe can be found in Katarina and 
Bianca's last name: Stratford. Their family is run by Walter Stratford 
(Pretty Woman's Larry Miller), a doctor who is all too familiar with 
teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly. In what he thinks 
to be a moment of ironic humor, the family "no dating" policy is amended 
to "Bianca can date...when [Katarina] does." With prom just ahead, 
Bianca's fate is grim; unless, of course, she can tame the shrew. 
Don't think this mission to be a simple one, as Bianca kindly points 
out, her sister "... is a particularly hideous breed of loser."
Getting Katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing. When 
Cameron, who likes Bianca, learns of her father's new rule, he is 
quick to consult a friend for advice. The scheme they dream up is to 
fully exploit "someone with money." In this case, that is Joey - the 
other guy with a crush on Bianca. Cameron's friend, a loser by teenage 
verdict, convinces Joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the 
shrew out. The solution lies no farther away than the second blatant 
reminder of the master scribe: Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). This 
Verona is far from fair; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene 
in prison. Moreover, Katarina openly opined to the aforementioned 
English teacher that "Hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around 
Picasso, hoping to nail his leftovers." The laws of high school cinema 
inexorably turn Patrick and Katarina into Romeo and Juliet.
Providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what 
Shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school 
comedy: A party polluted with liquor, a best friend's betrayal, and 
prom. It is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like 
Drive Me Crazy, American Pie, Never Been Kissed, Carrie, She's All 
That, and Can't Hardly Wait. Yet surely even these practices have 
roots in Shakespeare; Falstaff was a drunk, Romeo and Juliet met at a 
party, and Caesar learned about loyalty the hard way.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
"On October 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael 
Williams hiked into the Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film 
on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch,' and were never seen again. 
One year later, their footage was found." These are the opening lines of 
The Blair Witch Project. There are no credits, there is no flashback 
sequence, and there is no friendly narrator to guide you through this. 
The next 87 minutes is the three filmmakers' footage in chronological 
order - or so the audience is made to believe. In reality those 87 
minutes are occupied with unique filmmaking and a beautiful script which 
amalgamates for one of the scariest and most intense films since Alfred 
Hitchcock gave us a reason to not shower in 1960. But the film is not 
without its flaws either. A simple reality check can lead to some 
questionable aspects. And the production doesn't have the ability that 
Hitchcock had to make the film stick with you. 
The urban legend that is the Blair Witch is like most urban legends, in 
that it is confusing and unclear. Different people have different 
stories, and almost nothing is documented. The little that is known 
tells us that the Blair Witch has taken victims in the past, and is 
favorable to torturous, dismembering techniques. One person describes 
the creature as "an old woman, who's feet never touch the ground." 
Another description says "she was hairy from head to toe." That is, if 
there is a Blair Witch in the first place, something a respectably sized 
faction questions.
The unknowingly doomed group heads off into the Maryland woods after 
doing some brief interview work in Burkittsville, Maryland, where the 
town of Blair used to stand. The group of three gradually see their 
documentary evolve into a creepy and frustrating experience that tears 
at the very fabric of their relationships in a very similar manner to 
which MTV presents their popular show "The Real World."
At the core of the tumultuous relationship is Heather's authoritarian 
directing work. She demands nearly every moment be caught on film, 
including the behind-the-scenes aspects which she insists the group will 
someday look back on laugh. The footage is intentionally shaky, 
co-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanches' attempt to give the film 
the ultimate realistic feel. But after a while you are led to question 
why the footage taken for the film would be of such a poor nature if 
Heather really is the great perfectionist that she is made out to be. 
You also can't help but notice than not more than once is any mention of 
reloading film made; despite the movie's claim of 21 roles being 
discovered.   
In The Blair Witch Project, there are no ghosts, no goblins, no 
monsters, there isn't even a witch shown on screen. There is no 
background music to gradually lead the audience into fear. There is only 
one isolated incident of blood and gore, a very mild one at that. 
Instead of using these traditional aspects to bring the crowd into 
horror and fear, the production simply plays with your nerves. By 
telling you the fate of the three protagonists before the film opens, a 
permanent dramatic irony is created. However, this aspect also brings a 
major downside as well. About one hour into the film, things have 
already gotten creepy and the group is already at odds with each other. 
This creates a sort of "Just die already!" sense, that makes the meager 
87 minutes seem perhaps a few too many.
The Blair Witch Project is definitely a clever film. Although Artisan 
Entertainment declined my request for a budget figure, it can be assumed 
that the movie was made at a fraction of what most independent films 
cost,  and couldn't even be fairly measured against the budget of 
Hollywood blockbusters. During the movie I was scared, but towards the 
end a feeling came over me where I just wanted the darn thing to end. 
And when it did, there was a queasy feeling in my stomach, but I think 
it came from eating too much popcorn.

Title
Review for Best Man, The (1999/I)
The Best Man is a film about a gathering of old friends. Ironically, the 
movie is little more than a series of old stereotypes and plagiarized 
plot moments. Above all else, this production is a painful experience 
that can only solicit ideas of ways your $7.50 could be better spent 
(throwing it in the lion's cage, flushing it down the toilet, using it 
to light a fire, etc85).
The Best Man is a story of friends who re-unite one long weekend for a 
wedding. Harper (Taye Diggs) hasn't seen any of his pals in a while and 
looks forward to a pleasant and enjoyable time. What he doesn't know is 
that the whole gang has obtained advance copies of his new "novel," 
which is frighteningly close to the story of their lives. As the reunion 
progresses, the secrets spill out. The only question is how much damage 
will be done. 
One of the ever-so-rare qualities of The Best Man is its soundtrack. 
Songs by Bob Marley, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell oftentimes dominate the 
moment. Unfortunately even this quality proves ominous. Great soundtrack 
music has become nearly synonymous with The Big Chill. Once that 
realization is met the other "similarities" pour on. The idea of a 
revealing weekend bash revolving around a key stage in a friend's life 
(The Big Chill was actually an ending stage, being centered around a 
funeral) that ultimately gives some old pals a perspective on where they 
are is about as original as the supposedly fictional characters in 
Harper's book.
The similarities do not stop with one 1983 film. Before the two hours, 
that seem more like an eternity, end, the audience is treated to scenes 
originally from or similar to several films, including American Beauty, 
Very Bad Things, Your Friends & Neighbors, Love Stinks, A Few Good Men 
and Orgazmo.
Some of the stereotypes exhibited cannot be pinned to just one or two 
films, but rather are so common that they feel like a dE9j=E0 vu that =
you cannot exactly place. The great old line "You love me, don't you?," 
a virgin that perhaps isn't, a man being held over the edge of a 
building, a relationship conflict in an airport and the overuse of 
semi-slow motion at a wedding are highlights of such dE9j=E0 vu.
Even when the stereotypes and plagiarized moments are ignored, The Best 
Man still has more than its due of problems. The film spends a lot of 
time talking about sex and who exactly is or was participating in the 
act. Yet the movie never actually has any intercourse and consequently 
looks like the school bully who talks a great talk but can't even limp 
the walk.
The supporting roles are blurred at the beginning of the film and 
gradually become clearer. Although this evolution may sound interesting, 
it creates a problem for the film: You don't know who is who. This 
transformation finally reaches a payoff point about 90 minutes into the 
film. Unfortunately the production suffers from excess sappiness from 
that moment forward. Too many emotions and slow motion shots get bunched 
together and the already too long film reaches near infinite length. 
This sappiness is highlighted by a scene involving two characters' 
relationship and a bible. It comes as mighty symbolic that the movie 
misquotes the bible. (Exodus 24:10 has absolutely nothing to do with 
adultery as the film claims.)
The Best Man is a film about forgiveness. That doesn't mean that it is a 
film that can be forgiven.

Review for End of Days (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://moviereviews.org/review_-_end_of_days.htm
End of Days goes up in flames- literally. With both the hereditary flaws 
of an apocalyptic film, poor acting and a lack of that magical quality 
that oftentimes makes unrealistic action movies seem plausible; it is 
most fitting that the title card in the opening credits is on fire.
There are certain liberties which movies like this can take. Over the 
summer Universal, the parent of this work, released Bowfinger, a comedic 
satire which explained that if the action is good, the plot doesn't have 
to make sense. James Cameron knows about this. His Terminator films 
hardly hold their own weight in a world of Jane Austen (incidentally, 
there actually is a Jane Austen film opening opposite this movie) but 
the effects are grade-A and Arnold Shwarzenegger (from here on out known 
as "Arnie") is at his best. Unfortunately, director Peter Hyams doesn't 
have those Cameronian effects and the key performance is Arnie-lite.
After a brief opening stint in 1979's Vatican City and New York City, we 
are taken to the big apple of December 28, 1999. In three days, 1000 
years will be over and Satan has a plan to end all humanity. The end of 
days will require the rape and pregnancy of the chosen one (named 
Christine York and played by Robin Tunney) between the hours of 11:00pm 
and midnight, Eastern Standard Time. The offspring will then come alive 
Rosemary's Baby style and all of existence will be negated. The details 
on how exactly this takeover will occur are omitted (if they ever 
existed in the first place).
Arnie plays a security guard for hire. He takes a bullet for his client 
(actually, the movie uses an old bulletproof vest joke to create the 
false illusion that he is dead, something that clearly can't happen to 
the star only 15 minutes into the movie) and pursues the shooter. The 
man with the gun turns out to be a priest who chose a life of poverty 
over the church. Arnie catches up with him and he mutters an apocalyptic 
phrase before Arnie shoots him. Seem strange yet? It gets more bizarre. 
The guy doesn't have a tongue.
The movie continues in this worn-out chase, kill, chase, kill, etc85 =
format until you are absolutely fed up with apocalyptic mythology. The 
only interesting or original revelation the movie makes is that Simon 
and Garfunkel were right, "the words of the prophets are written on the 
subway walls."  
Somewhere in this tangled plot lies a corrupt police officer, some 
bodies that are taken from the dead, a few explosions, a flying 
helicopter sequence, Latin codes, stigmata and a whole lot of burning 
candles.
There is a basic flaw in films that threaten to end all existence: they 
very rarely do. Most directors are far too frightened to produce a movie 
that ends by telling everyone in the audience that they are dead. On 
occasion, exceptions are made. Recently (SPOILER OF ANOTHER MOVIE 
AHEAD), The Astronaut's Wife used this tactic which raised a few brows 
but hardly cleaned up at the box office.
Not long ago, the Catholic Church got in an uproar over the release of 
Dogma, another film that used the bible and some astray theories to 
threaten a negation of existence. End of Days takes it all even further 
with gun toting priests, ritual birth ceremonies with snake's blood and 
a massive shootout in a church. It remains a mystery as to why the 
church didn't get upset over this production.
The movie does have some other problems. Satan is a far too agreeable 
character. At one point many viewers may actually root for him. As in 
many action works, there are numerous continuity issues such as the 
convenient vanishing of walls and violations of physics. The writers 
must have seen how Kevin Pollak was merely reprising his excellent 
performance from The Usual Suspects in this film and slipped in a 
blatantly ripped off line, "Satan's greatest trick was convincing man he 
didn't exist." Perhaps the movie's tagline, "The end is near," is meant 
to reassure audiences of the closing credits.

Title
Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at =
http://www.moviereviews.org/the_green_mile.htm
---Starting on Christmas Eve you can hear Mac VerStandig's movie reviews 
on the radio in Portland, Maine once a week in addition to reading them 
on Moviereviews.org. Details on time and dial placement still to come. 
Stay tuned!---
The Green Mile, the film Warner Bros. is grooming for best picture 
glory, commits the same sin as Paramount's prized contender Angela's 
Ashes: the movie uses the emotional sentiments that death presents as a 
crutch of support for an otherwise weak and underdeveloped production. 
Both films also run too long, with Angela's Ashes weighing in at 140 
minutes and The Green Mile at 190 (that is 11,400 painful tic-tocks).
Set in a Louisiana penitentiary during the great depression, The Green 
Mile, based on Stephen King's novel, is a story of death row inmates and 
guards. The film's title is the term used for the walk from an inmate's 
cell to the electric chair, nicknamed "Old Sparky."
The protagonist is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks who merits a best actor 
nomination), the head guard. Having walked the mile numerous times and 
witnessed more deaths than one man ever should, Paul has come to respect 
most of the inmates and offers them whatever dignity he can, especially 
in their final hours. Warner Bros.' deceptive marketing campaign tells 
you that Paul forms a special relationship with one inmate in 
particular, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan, deserving of a best 
supporting actor nomination), who possess magical healing powers. Coffey 
does have mystical abilities but there is no special relationship (or, 
if there is, it is on the editing room floor).
Rather than develop Coffey or explore Edgecomb's personal life in depth 
(his wife seems interesting, but we hardly get to know her), the film 
chooses to focus its attention on another guard and another inmate, both 
cruel people. (Caution: SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD!) These two characters are as 
clichE9 as Hollywood can make them. The inmate is responsible for the =
murders that Coffey clearly didn't commit, something that seems a tad 
too ironic since there are only three inmates. It is also rather 
coincidental that the same revelation takes place in The Shawshank 
Redemption, a film from the same writer and director. The guard is 
single-dimensionally cruel to others, emotionless and death loving, 
making him the perfect Superman villain. But this film is neither a 
bird, a plane nor Superman, it is a serious death row drama and the 
character doesn't fit.
The Green Mile doesn't introduce Coffey's Cinderella qualities for the 
first hour and a quarter, the length of time that many films take to 
reach their conclusion. Even after that, the magic is a limited aspect 
of the movie until the end. Cinderella and death row probably don't mix 
in the first place, but not giving the silver slippers a fighting chance 
is self-destructive and yet another argument for a further development 
of Coffey.
The Green Mile could have been the contender that Warner Bros. wants it 
to be; the material is there. By cutting the evil guard and inmate you 
free up a lot of time. Fill some of the time with more Coffey and some 
of it with more of Edgecomb's home life. Stop there. Cut the movie 
between 120 and 135 minutes and this critic would consider the final 
product a modern classic.

Title
Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
---This review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/rules_of_engagement1.htm --
Fast paced, decidedly lowbrow and gory enough to ensure an `R' rating, Rules
of Engagement is the most recent installment in Hollywood's oldest and most
classic genre: The Popcorn Flick. The acting is good, plot holes many and
concession stand just down the hall.
Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel Jackson) and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee
Jones) served together in Vietnam where Childers saved Hodges' life. 28
years later, Childers has been through Beirut and Desert Storm while Hodges
has been through Georgetown Law. Before they both retire from the United
States Marine Corps, there is one last war to be fought.
While on a mission in Yemen to save the US Ambassador and his family from
hostile Islamic Fundamentalists protesting outside the embassy, Childers
witnesses the death of three of his marines as the armed crowd fires at his
squad. Following the rules of engagement and recognizing that an armed
civilian is no longer a civilian, Childers orders his men to open fire on
the rowdy protesters. Soon 89 Yemenis are dead and over a hundred others
injured. But for Childers, his mission has been accomplished: he rescued the
ambassador, saved as many of his men as possible and defused a unruly
situation through the necessary means (needless to say, the movie has some
issues establishing him as the genuine good-guy that he is supposed to be).
Imagine his surprise when he returns to the United States to learn that the
National Security Advisor is leading a political cover up and has decided
that a) the massacred crowd was unarmed (not many people have to be hushed
for such an allusion to be created) and b) Childers should stand murder
charges for shooting unarmed civilians.
Hodges owes his life to Childers and he will now have an opportunity to
repay that enormous debt in front of a court marshal. But first he will have
to convince himself that he is a worthy attorney, resolve a long-standing
yet unspoken conflict with his decorated father (there's a new one!) and
stop drinking (Tommy Lee Jones as a struggling alcoholic - who would have
thought?).
The movie's opening scene, set in the unruly jungles of Vietnam, is among
the more graphic that can be found in a primarily non-war film. But this is
necessary as the Childers character is established via the Asian war. And
although the gore might be more than what one wishes to see in a Hollywood
film, give credit for such reality to Platoon and Saving Private Ryan's Dale
Dye, the film's military technical adviser, who served 20 years in the
Marines (some of which were spent in that Vietnamese setting) before taking
to the more glamorous life that Hollywood provides.
Islamic supporters will likely be just as outraged at this film as they were
at 1998's The Siege, a movie they elected to picket nationwide. A critical
scene has Islamic propaganda spewing anti-Western sentiments, just an
example of the general stereotyping that paints the faith as being based on
terrorism. Even Islamic women and children are made to look bad at times.
Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson certainly don't wander into any new
territory with their roles here. Jones just had a similar part in last year'
s Double Jeopardy and Jackson gives an encore of his performance from The
Negotiator. Together, they make yet another excellent semi-action/semi-drama
duo that will likely go largely unnoticed come awards season (past examples
include John Travolta and Nicholas Cage for Face/Off, Samuel L. Jackson and
Kevin Spacey for The Negotiator and numerous James Bond good-guy/bad-guy
duos).
Unfortunately, some plot holes are far greater than those normally pardoned
in action films. A key witness is never called even though he is never
hushed, some simple trajectory tests that could end the trial are never
bothered with and a man standing trial for murder is never put behind bars
for reasons not clearly explained. Also, the film uses a cheap out-technique
when displaying white cards at the end to tie up some loose ends that would
have well been worth another 30 minutes. With the exception of documentaries
and films that have a smoother ending than this one, such cards should never
be needed.
Well, Hollywood's oldest institution has grown over time. Concession stands
no longer offer a genuine butter topping and you are naturally on the
edge-of-your seat during a film because the seats are too small in which to
sit back. Still, Rules of Engagement fits the modern requirements rather
well - plenty of action, court room suspense, good acting, a few errors and
a predictable ending - and you will be hard pressed to find better kernels
popping elsewhere.

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/frequency.htm ---
Frequency, the first film penned by Toby Emmerich (Noah's brother), is so
beautifully crafted and stunningly patriotic that it moves through its
almost two hours without a moment of boredom. This, despite an
oftentimes-painful lack of intellectual breadth and plot holes that only
serve to detract from a film that could have easily been on par with
classics like Field of Dreams.
The movie requires audiences to suspend belief and accept a rather
far-fetched plot that is actually refreshingly innocent and magical, not
unlike Cinderella's midnight curfew: because of a special alignment in the
evening sky, one that hasn't been seen so brightly for 30 years, John
Sullivan (a mediocre Jim Caviezel) is able to speak with his father, Frank
(an excellent Dennis Quaid),  who has been dead for those 30 years.
As the duo chat away under the stars every evening, they begin to change the
history of the three decades that separate them - this is interesting.
Unfortunately, as the two try to change some untoward events (namely Frank's
untimely death and his wife's murder), it seems that no one is effected
other than the characters immediately pertaining to the story. Essentially,
the movie tries to isolate chaos theory according to what is convenient to
explain and disregard what would be too much of a hassle to further develop.
Interestingly, the film makes you ponder what it would be like to be in
Frank's shoes. Similar to one of the punishments a death row inmate faces,
Frank now knows how and approximately when he will die and, additionally, is
deprived of the privilege of seeing his son grow up and wondering what he
will do with his life. Unfortunately, Frequency does little to address these
questions and leaves them to the audience as more of an afterthought than
significant query. It would be well worth the extra time, even if the film
surpassed two and a half hours, for these questions to be dealt with on
screen rather than have the two main characters so easily accept the
nighttime magic and all of its side effects.
All the main characters in Frequency are either police officers, firemen or
nurses. With the exception of the aforementioned serial killer, who brings
contrast to the production, everyone is the ultimate red-blooded American.
Baseball, the American pastime, is a favorite topic of conversation, a cold
beer the preferred drink and New York City the place to be. Similarly,
Frequency is the typical, feel-good American movie. Sure, there are a few
plot holes and some things could be slightly better thought out, but family
values have rarely seen a heavier emphasis then they get here and that is
just about as American as one can get.

Title
Review for Eyes of Tammy Faye, The (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/eyes_of_tammy_faye,_the.htm ---
Years from now, when the 1980's are reduced to a few meager paragraphs in
textbooks, only a few names will make the cut. Ronald Reagan and Oliver
North will probably be two of them for the infamous Iran-Contra scandal.
Ditto Mike Milken and Ivan Boesky for their notorious Wall Street
activities. And surely Jim Bakker will also find his way into the history
books as a founder of televangelism and a man who fell fast and hard. But
where is his partner? The other giants, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Pat
Boone are all still standing - Bakker alone when to jail. Of course, there
was his loyal wife who seemed to vanish at the end of the turbulent decade
and never resurfaced. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' asks the question: `Whatever
happened to Tammy Faye?'
Tammy Faye grew up in Small Town, USA as a Christian girl with such strong
faith that she claims a finger wart of hers was cured during communion one
Sunday. When in college, she met her religious equal and married him within
a year. Jim and Tammy Faye Baker would go on to make Pat Robertson who he
is, build three Christian television networks and practically create the
electronic pulpit.
The couple, who became the most popular Christian force in America,
redefined how it all worked. Tammy welcomed a homosexual suffering from AIDS
on air  something that had previously been taboo in the faith. Together,
they gave religious television a new look: no longer would it be super
serious and oftentimes boring, rather it would have a carnival like
atmosphere. Tammy insists `we believed Christianity should be fun' as she
recollects how she sung and used puppets, Jim introduced magicians and
clowns, and together they spread their religion over the Praise The Lord
Network (a. k. a. `PTL').
Of course, such an operation wasn't cheap. They were constantly asking for
donations and raising money. The bigger they got, the more expensive their
network became. When Jim decided to build a theme park  one that would be
the third largest in the world  the cost of operation per every two days
was $1 million. That's equivalent to 50,000 $10 pledges a day.
Then, in the 1980's, it all came crashing down. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'
with a clear pro-Tammy bias, pins most of the couple's problems on Jerry
Falwell. Rather than Jim Bakker being at fault for his infamous rendezvous
with Jessica Hahn, Jerry Falwell is the troublemaker. It is strongly implied
that Falwell leaked word of the affair to the news media and it is stated,
by many people, in very clear language, that Falwell maliciously conned the
couple out of PTL and then intentionally bankrupt the empire. It is even
alleged that he went a step further and insured that Jim and Tammy Faye
suffer public humiliation  possibly even framing Jim for the financial
irregularities that ultimately led to his being sentenced to 45 years in
prison. At one point, the film goes so far as to indirectly refer to Falwell
as `The Dragon.'
Of course, Jerry Falwell allegedly wasn't alone in sabotaging the couple.
The documentary assures us that the trial was biased from the beginning, the
press just as slanted and the American people all-too unforgiving.
Could it be? Is it just possible that America's largest religious scandal in
memory was actually a sham? Tammy Faye, between many tears and sobbing,
denies that either she or Jim ever misplaced a penny. Rather, it is
conveyed, that she merely suffers from bad luck and is continuously forced
to survive what no person should have to endure. As soon as we learn of her
phobia of flying, we see her in a plane that is grounded mid-route because
of weather problems. It all strikes a note that belongs in an Alanis
Morissette song. Yet, as frustrating as Morissette's `Ironic' may have been,
it was still a very entertaining piece. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' is no
different.

Review for Road to Glory (2000)
--- A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/phorpa_(the_cup).htm ----
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---
The Cup, the first feature length film to ever be made in Bhutan, is a 
delightfully innocent piece that should be a strong contender in 1999's 
Best Foreign Film category.
Inspired by true events, The Cup is the story of an Indian monastery 
housing children with assorted international roots. The newest arrivals, 
Palden (Kunsang Nyima) and Nyima (Pema Tshundup) parted with their 
parents and were smuggled across the Tibetan border to the monastery so 
they could freely study Buddhism. The film touches upon the obvious 
politics of this delicate situation, but wisely shies away from handling 
the issue too seriously, something that would likely deduct from an 
otherwise lighthearted movie.
Awaiting the two new arrivals is Orygen (Jamyang Lodro), a 
self-confident and adventurous 14-year-old monk. Orygen has his own 
little near-religious cult that is celebrating its holiest of events 
which only occurs once every four year: The World Cup of soccer. Soon 
Ronaldo's biggest fan finds himself and his pals in a bind when they are 
caught sneaking out to watch part of the aforementioned tournament one 
night and are threatened with expulsion should they ever do so again. 
But the crafty Orygen wouldn't let the approaching final match pass by 
without his audience, and soon a surprisingly innocent plot is hatched.
One of the more fascinating aspects of The Cup is how the 1998 setting 
and the century old Buddhist traditions coexist. Orygen's wardrobe is 
2500 years old, but underneath he wears a soccer jersey. His walls are 
covered with a magazine clipped shrine to the sport, but he studies 
religion in bed. The list goes on.
Nearly all the young monks in the monastery find a certain fascination 
with soccer that goes beyond the concept of men fighting over a 
checkered ball. The singing of the National Anthems is a key point to 
the multi-national boys and the athletes on the field are truly 
ambassadors of their native lands.
The Cup is a very sweet film that should be well received by audiences 
that aren't deterred by subtitles. An upcoming release in the USA will 
likely lead to public note and boosted box office revenue can be 
expected should the country of Bhutan win an Oscar for their freshman 
attempt at the art. And even if no awards are collected, the nation's 
sophomore film will be eagerly anticipated.

Keeping the Faith combines all the old `So, there's a Rabbi and a Priest'
jokes, a beautiful romance and some righteously funny scenes to be the most
hilarious, insightful and fulfilling comedy in years. So who's to credit?
Could it be the hilarious Ben Stiller who comes out of his post There's
Something About Mary slump? Perhaps it is the equally funny and sexy Jenna
Elfman who is simply radiant on screen. Or maybe it is screenwriter Stuart
Blumberg who conceived the equally deep and amusing script. My vote goes to
Edward Norton, the actor that has been nominated for two Oscars in just nine
films, who not only breaks into the world of comedy here (although he did
have a small role in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You) but makes a
brilliant directorial debut as well.
Jake (Ben Stiller), Brian (Edward Norton) and Anna (Jenna Elfman) grew up
best friends in New York City. But after the eighth grade, Anna's father
accepted a job out west and Jake and Brian found themselves with only each
other to finish out their childhoods.
Time has passed. Jake and Brian are still the closest of friends although
their professions - Rabbi and Priest respectively - certainly wouldn't
indicate so. On the inner-city basketball courts they are known as `God
Squad' and in their respective houses of worship they are known as
reformers. Together they are trying to build a Catholic/Jewish nightclub
complete with karaoke. For Brian this isn't a conflict at all. But Jake's
superiors at the synagogue are troubled by his prayer/meditation sessions,
improvisation-filled sermons and, most recently, acquiring of a gospel choir
to rev up the congregation for Ein Keiloheinu (easily one of the funniest
scenes ever to grace the silver screen).
Then, one day, Brian gets a phone call. Soon the two religious leaders are
standing at a LaGuardia terminal with a sign reading `Anna Banana.' The girl
who once completed the trio is now a successful businesswoman who jokes
about her relationship with her cell phone. There are years of catching up
to be done in between confessions, Bar-Mitzvah lessons, conference calls and
group efforts to help Jake out with his pathetic love life.
To recap, there are three single friends that haven't been together in over
a decade. Two of them, a guy and a girl, are single and the third has taken
an oath prohibiting him from entering the dating game. You can figure out
the rest.
Norton, Stiller and Elfman all deliver great comedic performances. The film
opens with Norton playing an exaggerated drunk and this sets the tone for a
movie that will crack jokes about serious things. Elfman and Stiller both
take on, and succeed at, double-duties, not only trying to be funny but
romantic and, occasionally, ultra-serious as well.
You needn't look further than the 11 o'clock news to see religious wars
around the world. The Pope has apologized on behalf of Catholics for doing
nothing to stop the Holocaust, although you will be hard pressed to find him
saying it in such blunt terms. Recently a war was fought in Kosovo over
religious issues. Israel and Northern Ireland have grown accustomed to
religious warfare. These are sad things that force society to pause in
reflection. Some movies, like Life is Beautiful, Train of Life and Jacob the
Liar, have tried to make humor out of such tragedy. In this critic's
opinion, they have failed. Perhaps that is why Keeping the Faith is so
uproariously funny. Sure, the old circumcision, holy water and Jewish-mother
jokes make for humorous moments. But the overall comedy derives from the
unlikely situation of best friends not only affirming their faith in
different religions, but also leading those religions.
So, there's a Rabbi and a Priest (The punch line can be found at a theatre
near you).

Review for Gigantic (2000)
---Please note, a copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/gigantic.htm and will be added to the
Moviereviews.org FilmFest D. C. coverage section when the festival begins---

Producer Tom Tykwer's follow-up to the acclaimed Run Lola Run, Gigantic
follows three friends through a night in Hamburg, Germany as one of the trio
prepares to depart permanently the next morning. The production's only weak
points are the fault of international barriers, not the filmmakers, with a
critical scene causing confusion over international currencies and another
relying on two languages being spoken thus losing its effect with the
monolingual English subtitles. The film's climax is a table-soccer game,
something this critic has never imagined could be so exhilarating. Mixed
into the touching and entertaining night in Germany are themes of
homosexuality, dormant nazism awakening and one's responsibility for others.
At the end of the movie's 77 minute duration one thing is clear: Gigantic
has a heart the size of its title.

Review for Gladiator (2000)
---Please note that a copy of this review will appear at
http://www.moviereviews.org/gladiator.htm on May 5, 2000. A copy will also
run in the May 10 - 24 edition of The Stage Newspaper. Mac VerStandig will
additionally review the film on WTPN-Radio on May 5, 2000. ---
When at its best, Gladiator is one of the great films of all time. Every
moment is exhilarating, every fight engaging and every moral and statement
so well thought out and of such a classic nature that they can be
appreciated and pondered simultaneously. However, when at its worse,
Gladiator's two-and-a-half hour length takes the spotlight off the film's
numerous virtues to the point where a slip in the projection gave a preview
audience an unintended intermission necessary to tolerate some upcoming
moments that would make `Wuthering Heights' seem like a page-turner.
Fortunately, the good disproportionately outweighs the bad so much that you
should have no reservations about seeing this film if you want to be
in-the-loop on Oscar night.
The first person onscreen is, appropriately enough, Maximus (Russell Crowe,
setting the bar for this year's Best Actor race), the movie's hero. When we
meet him he is a general at war commanding thousands of troops in the name
of pre-Nero Rome. Like most great war heroes in the movies, Maximus is
humble and wise. His motivation in battle is more to return to his family
than to defend Rome. Although, given the benevolent nature of the empire's
current Caesar, he has no qualms fighting for the great city.
Maximus' skill, bravery and humane qualities are rewarded when he is
informed that he, not the Caesar's son, will inherit the emperorship of
Rome. Yet one of the inherit rules applying to just about all of Hollywood's
great epics is that the kinder the ruler is, the crueler and less loyal his
son. Gladiator isn't an exception. Soon Maximus is no longer a General but
rather a slave and no longer fighting for his family but rather the name of
the great Caesar who once tried to name him his successor only to be
murdered by his blood son that very evening.
Above all else, credit Ridley Scott, the director of the film. And then give
John Mathieson, the deft cinematographer, his due as well. The two brilliant
behind-the-scenes men have created an ancient Rome that few will have
trouble accepting as reality. Thousands of extras are coordinated perfectly
down to the most irrelevant details which only a nit-picky critic like
myself would pay any heed. As for the scenery and backgrounds, to call them
gorgeous would be an enormous understatement  if Dreamworks needs to make
any more money off this film, they should have no difficulty selling
postcards.
Yet surely Scott and Mathieson wouldn't have been able to accomplish this
incredible feat without the aid of a $100 million budget. What does this
tell us about Hollywood today? Perhaps those nine figures are the proof that
although a fluke like The Blair Witch Project will come around from time to
time, enough money combined with the right individuals can create a movie as
marvelous and spectacular as Gladiator. Unfortunately, the large sum
ultimately makes a little too much movie as the creative duo seem to have
gotten caught up in scenery and re-creating the past so much so that they
forget to advance the plot at certain points and instead test the audience's
patience with a craft that belongs in an art gallery, not on the silver
screen.
Gladiator's good guys share a political philosophy of favoring the Senate
over a dictator-like emperor. Many of the more loveable characters also put
their faith in an afterlife as a form of surviving their less-than-ideal
current lives. These issues raise enough debate that Gladiator manages to
achieve its final success by crossing the border from being just another
heroic epic to being a modern-day classic, not unlike Ben-Hur and
Braveheart, even if the film could use some trimming around the edges.

Review for Siege, The (1998)
One of the most interesting scenarios that is posed by United States law 
is the option for the military to take control in a time of crisis, and 
declare a state of martial law. Being that this has never been done for 
a period of time long enough to encounter the various circumstances it 
would raise, martial law remains a mysterious threat to the American 
people. It could be a saving grace or it could be a nightmare. With that 
known, martial law could have provided one of the greatest settings that 
is possible for a movie. And then, imagine this moving having 3 great 
actors like Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis and Annette Bening. The 
Siege had potential written all over it. And, to some degree, it met 
it's potential. However, for the most part, The Siege turned out to be 
little more than an average films with a few high points.
The year is 2000. (Although that is never actually stated, the Oklahoma 
City bombing is often mentioned as having been 5 years earlier.) That 
gives a time in the future so that we may suspend all belief, but it 
also allows for a present day society. Somewhere in the middle east, an 
Islamic leader is taken hostage by the US military. This is classified 
information though, and ranks as high as the president are not informed. 
New York City is suddenly taken by surprise as a series of massive 
terrorist attacks all take place in Brooklyn. FBI/NYPD officer Hubbard 
(Denzel Washington) is at the very front of the investigation. His 
partner is the Lebanese-American Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub). And CIA 
agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening) is brought in to assist. On top of 
that, General Devereaux (Bruce Willis) of the US military, is in New 
York offering his assistance as well.
The biggest problem in looking into these terrorist bombings, is that 
they are all suicide bombings. Other than the fact that the bomber is 
always Islamic, the FBI/CIA/NYPD/Military have nothing to work with 
because the suspect is always dead, and therefore there are no links 
left back to the mastermind. Even worse, it is feared that there may not 
be a mastermind, but rather the "mastermind" is the Islamic faith.
Through a series of events, Brooklyn is declared to be a dangerous area 
and a war is declared against terrorism. However, unlike previous events 
in American history in which the president declared a "war on 
terrorism," this war is quite literal. General Devereaux is put in 
charge, and New York quickly becomes a city under siege. Every street is 
covered with military, and traffic isn't caused by cars, but rather 
tanks. AK-47 Assault Riffles become as common as candy during the 
holiday season.
What you have in The Siege should be every American's worst nightmare. 
The basic rights that are often taken for granted, are revoked. Freedom 
of speech is quick to go, and from there life is a rapid deterioration. 
The mere thought of a martial law is intensely frightening. The Siege 
has 3 big name actors that help make this one of the most intense films 
of the year. Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis are brilliant. Often 
given the opportunity to deliver monologues and speeches, they are the 
most powerful part of this film. Not since Michael Douglas declared 
greed to be good in the 1987 award winning film Wall Street, have lines 
been delivered that well. However, Annette Bening is a huge 
disappointment. Not only is she remarkably not believable in what 
appears to be a simple role, but she is frustrating to watch. You are 
reminded of the little kid in a school play who just can't remember that 
one line. But, on a brighter note, the relatively unheard of Tony 
Shalhoub in incredible. Though never given a huge scene, or monologue of 
a comparable nature to Willis or Washington, he gets the job done in 
stylish fashion.
The last problem that The Siege encounters, is the incredibly racist 
message. The Nation of Islam is the villain. Not a member of the faith, 
although members are singled out, but rather the impression given is 
that the entire faith is somewhat at fault for terrorism. Throughout 
Washington D. C. this film has been protested. Upon exiting the theater, 
I was given a flyer by a protester explaining what the true beliefs are 
and how the movie distorted them. To find a movie as ignorantly racist 
as this, you would have to go back to 1915 and D. W. Griffith's The 
Birth of a Nation. And yet, that managed to survive all these years 
because it was a ground breaking masterpiece. Unfortunately, the siege 
doesn't have those values to it.

Review for Dinosaur (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://moviereviews.org/dinosaur.htm ---
If there were some way to weigh a film's quality against its budget, movies
like `The Blair Witch Project,' `Clerks' and even `The Godfather' would
score excellent ratings. On the other hand, movies like `Titanic,'
`Waterworld' and `The Postman' would receive shamefully low grades. But
those infamous three works no longer need to worry about being at the very
bottom of such a list because, in one of the more surprising revelations of
the year, Disney has dumped $200 million on `Dinosaur'  a truly wretched
plague upon the silver screen.
Plot? What plot? Yep folks, Disney seems to have forgotten that they are
what they are today because they used to be in the story-telling business.
`Dinosaur' starts off with a semi-amusing storyline, even though it is
stolen from another Disney film, `Tarzan,' (a creature born to and raised by
the wrong species, in this case a dinosaur and some furry little monkeys
respectively) but then the movie becomes more or less a tremendously
oversized David Mamet play where the protagonists just wander back and forth
contemplating life's issues. Now, this works quite well with two or three
characters, a simple set and a highbrow audience. But here we have a whole
stampede of prehistoric creatures, no defined setting (is the film in
Africa? Montana? Earth?) and a target audience of tots to early teens.
Imagine sending in the 82nd Airborne to work as meter maids in a small Rhode
Island town - now you get the picture.
But hey, even when Disney fails elsewhere there are always those
embarrassingly catchy tunes to keep you entertained, right? Not here. Nope,
folks  the Mouse House seems to think it has outgrown Elton John. Big
mistake! This leaves the audience with officially no pop-music salvation and
only a mawkish score to distract themselves.
So at least there is $200 million worth of eye candy to stare at for
80-someodd minutes, right? Not exactly (do I feel like a Hertz commercial or
what!). Actually, the 3.2 million hours of work, 45 terabytes of disc space
(approximately equal to 70,000 CD-ROMs) and enough money to pay the
President of the United States' salary for the next millennium accomplish
very little. Steven Spielberg's `Jurassic Park' has better dinosaurs, Jerry
Bruckheimer knows how to make a better chase scene and Joel Schumacher is
superior in terms of manufacturing a scarcely-lit film. The prehistoric
creatures, although obviously carefully crafted, look too childish and
stereotypical - the good ones are smooth, the bad guys have sharp teeth and
horns while the little ones possess hearts of gold. One early scene with an
explosion looks like a combination of the bomb being dropped over Hiroshima
and Nicholas Cage narrowly escaping being engulfed in a gigantic fireball.
As for the seemingly never-ending thunder and lightning that conveniently
roles around every time something bad happens, it creates more of an `8MM'
type feeling than that of a kids movie.
Further confusing the target audience are a couple of very muddled morals.
On one hand, the film earns major points for encouraging teamwork. On the
other hand, (SPOILER AHEAD) the picture's hero will ultimately act alone, as
his peers look on, to win the final battle of the film.
There is little doubt that Disney will recover from `Dinosaur' and once
again find itself at the top of the animation kingdom. Actually, they
already have a $75 million visual effects studio that was built for this
movie but will be reusable for future projects. For the mean time, though,
trust your science teacher  dinosaurs are extinct for a reason.

Title
Review for Chicken Run (2000)
As I watched the sweeping landscapes, gory battles and generally noteworthy 
performances that comprise "The Patriot," a very inappropriate thought simply 
refused to exit my mind: Mel Gibson as a chicken.
Gibson takes on two very different roles in "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run," 
two appropriately diverse films opening in the month of June. In the premier, 
he plays a British-born man who will help lead the American Revolution. In 
the latter, he plays an American-born (?) Rooster who will lead a revolution 
of British chickens. Both very entertaining films - albeit for different 
reasons - the less serious "Chicken Run" is ultimately the superior. 
Nick Park, the possibly-genius director who won an Oscar for his claymation 
"Creature Comforts" and has received wide acclaim for his "Wallace and 
Gromit" films - also claymations - teams up with Peter Lord for "Chicken Run" 
and the product is the first must-see film of the summer and a comedy so 
uproariously funny and unique that it is bound to survive the test of time, 
even if the entire production is nothing more than clay figures being 
meticulously moved very slightly in every frame (24 times every second!) to 
create a live-action appearance. 
"The Patriot," on the other hand, clearly aims for much more than laughs and 
a much more adult audience than the kids who will be most attracted to 
"Chicken Run" (although, the comedy does work on multiple levels and makes a 
great date flick). Unfortunately, "The Patriot" seems to aim too high and 
consequently is only an above-average film, not the great epic that its 
makers clearly set out to create. 
The revolution in "Chicken Run" comes about when a group of already 
disgruntled chickens learn that not only has one of their own been beheaded 
for her inability to lay eggs, but that they are all destined to be baked and 
boxed so that families on the run can zap them in a matter of minutes and 
still have a nutritious meal. Soon after the doomed flock learn this, Rocky - 
the self proclaimed "Lone Free Ranger" - shows up and appears to be their 
ticket to freedom. If the group can learn to fly, they will make it over the 
fence that separates them from freedom and vegetarian pies will have to 
suffice. But the process will be a grueling one in which several cock fights 
will erupt and civility will oftentimes take a back seat to the chaos caused 
by not very fair fowls who are actually rather chicken of what might happen 
to them should their plan fail.
"The Patriot" is decidedly more firmly planted in reality with its entire 
premise being based on the very-real Revolutionary War and a fictional family 
destroyed by it. Screenwriter Robert Rodat takes sole credit for this piece 
and having penned "Saving Private Ryan," - the greatest film ever made in 
this critic's opinion - the similar yet inferior premise is all but marked 
with his own blood. But don't think this production foreign to star Mel 
Gibson either, as the title could well be "Braveheart 2" and few would wince. 
Unfortunately, the plot is overburdened by Rodat's apparent need to kill as 
many people as he can in an attempt to jerk the maximum number of tears 
possible and to try to add excess depth with a slavery based side plot which 
serves no purpose other than to overload the film with morals. 
"The Patriot" does, however, comes across strong with some excellent 
supporting performances, - especially one by Chris Cooper - oftentimes 
breathtaking cinematography and a plot that, like it or not, does tap many 
emotions. 
"Chicken Run," on the other hand, taps many memories. Perhaps Lord and Park's 
brightest move is making the film very much adult-friendly with references to 
older films and a classic television show. When an escape attempt fails, you 
see a character bouncing a ball against the wall and "The Great Escape" comes 
to mind. And when the farm's dim owner continuously spies on his 
fine-feathered animals and then insists to his wife "they are organizing" 
only for them to scatter into chaotic formations when she takes a gander, 
memories of "Bewitched" run free. Other references include, but surely aren't 
limited to, "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Shawshank Redemption," 
"Stalag 17" Charly Chaplin's "Modern Times" and none other than Mr. Gibson's 
"Braveheart."
In the time it takes to watch "The Patriot," you can see "Chicken Run" twice. 
This may not be such a bad idea. Although, if you insist on seeing the longer 
war epic, do so while the movie is still on the big screen as the broad 
cinematography and battle scenes require such size. And if you decide to do 
like I did and see "Chicken Run" first and then "The Patriot," please give 
enough time in between so that you aren't stuck with mental images of a 
chicken in the Revolutionary War. These birds of a feather clearly don't 
flock together. 

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/magnolia.htm ---
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine are can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday morning on 98.9 The Point radio.---
Despite opening with footage of old black and white 16 millimeter film, 
Magnolia quickly splices away from many time-revered filmmaking 
fundamentals and bravely ventures into cutting-edge territory. In that 
sense, the film is a true first effort and, like many freshman attempts, 
the end-product is only semi-interesting but extremely noteworthy 
because of the boundaries it crosses.
The film, however, isn't director P. T. Anderson's initial voyage into 
Hollywood. He previously achieved momentary fame with the critically 
acclaimed but Academy-snubbed Boogie Nights. Many of the cast and crew 
members from that 1997 effort join him again here. He re-embraces a 
similar filmmaking style in Magnolia, but those that think Boogie Nights 
was as new-age as they could handle, will likely struggle through this 
production.
A dying father, woman at his side, a nurse taking care of him, a quiz 
show host, a well-intentioned cop, a coke-sniffing daughter, a former 
quiz show champion, a current quiz show champion and a sex-craving 
instructor of "Seduce and Destroy" courses. Throw in some men at the 
gallows, Hustler magazine and a mind-boggling biblical reference and all 
the pieces fit together as in a very fragile jig saw puzzle. But don't 
dare blink, because the one major connecting piece is quick, quiet and 
very subtle. It is trying to connect those pieces that is the film's 
plot. 
Not only does the movie venture outside the lines with the 
aforementioned unconventional plot, but the actual filmmaking technique 
used by P. T. Anderson might give some Tisch professors nightmares. The 
supposedly unbreakable 180 degree rule, which states that no cut should 
be made in one scene that jumps more than 180 degrees, is flagrantly 
ignored. Ditto the concept of never intentionally cutting off someone's 
head in the frame while they are talking. Yet the most shocking 
violation comes when Anderson uses shaky handheld footage, a technique 
normally only utilized when absolutely necessary, voluntarily.
In front of the camera is a rather impressive cast including Jason 
Robards, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, 
Julianne Moore and John C. Reilly. But the real treat is Tom Cruise who 
ventures into this film having just played a sex-craving New Yorker in 
legendary director Stanley Kubrick's last movie, Eyes Wide Shut. Here he 
is a sex preaching Californian whose in-your-face course includes 
lessons like "How to fake like you are nice and caring." (I would list 
more, but this is a family website.) Cruise will likely finally get an 
Oscar for this film in the form of Best Supporting Actor, after his 
previously being snubbed in the lead actor category for films like Born 
on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.
I am told that P. T. Anderson's director's cut of this movie was five 
hours long. I have little doubt that those 300 minutes of footage are 
boldly original and might fascinate hardcore film junkies. But to most, 
the movie will lose steam after about two hours in its current three 
hour state. Although its too early to tell, P. T. Anderson could 
ultimately end up leading a filmmaking revolution in Hollywood. Lets 
hope he doesn't cure insomnia in the process.  

Title
Review for Titan A.E. (2000)
--- A copy of this capsule review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/titan_ae.htm ---
A post-apocalyptic look at endangered bands of humans roaming an 
alien-dominated universe, "Titan AE" would be perhaps better suited for its 
Generation-X audience as a video game where attention spans can dictate 
length rather than the already overlong 90 minute production it currently is. 
Yet, America's youth would likely discard such a game if for no reason other 
than the extraordinarily inconsistent and oftentimes poor graphics. While the 
galactic images are quasi-mouth-watering, the species portrayed are more 
crude than those pictured in the recent "Pokemon: The First Movie," hardly a 
testament to the abilities of 21st century computer animators. The plot has 
many holes - not the least of which is a scene where the protagonist seems to 
be able to read the subtitles the film's editors have inserted to aid the 
audience in understanding a gibberish language. Indeed, so little is original 
with all the key concepts being recycled from previous works that a grand 
finale of "I am your father,. . ." would come as little surprise. 

Title
Review for Life (1999)
It has been said more than once that imitation is the highest form of 
flattery. Hollywood works much the same way, as only the truly great 
films seem to find themselves being imitated directly or indirectly in 
future releases. The one question that remains is whether or not an 
imitation can be as good as or better than an original. Sequels 
certainly don't tend to be, and remakes are very mixed. But what about 
in a movie like Life, where deja vu exists with no less than 5 other 
films but some level of originality is still in place? Director Ted 
Demme seems to have proven so.
Ray (Eddie Murphy) is a low life pick-pocket who makes a "living" going 
from petty crime to petty crime. Despite being witty, he seems to hold 
very little close to him emotionally, except for his father's grave, 
and has little sense of the true meaning of life.
Claude (Martin Lawrence) is a far more proper man. He has a job lined up 
for himself at the bank, and is almost over some bad debts. 
Unfortunately, he too has no true ambition in life, and plans on 
spending his money on Yankees tickets, rather than settling down and 
getting married to a woman that clearly loves him.
Through a very odd set of events that seems to wander from crime to 
crime, in a slow and boring fashion, the two men end up being sentenced 
to life in jail together, for a crime they did not commit. It is here 
that the rest of the film is to unfold, and where Claude and Ray are to 
learn exactly what a life sentence really is, and what it can take away 
from you.
A mere five years ago, The Shawshank Redemption was released and it had 
enormous success. Obviously, there are some stark similarities between 
the two films. Both feature an innocent protagonist (In Life's case, 
protagonists) who are in for the ultimate punishment. And both films go 
on to give commentaries on the institutionalization that prison can 
cause, by showing an older inmate dealing with a reality that the place 
he is soon to depart, has become a home to him. But that is where the 
similarities to that production end.
Other films, like Mr. Saturday Night, show two men growing old together 
and dealing with the cards they have been dealt. But none do so as 
spectacularly as this one. There are also scenes lifted from, but not 
limited to, Stir Crazy, Murder in the First, and Spartacus. But none of 
those have any true similarities beyond the obvious settings (prison) 
and situations. So, despite being very similar, Life does manage to take 
it's own direction.
Another potential grim point for this film is the obvious lack of 
reputable actors in the primary casting. To date, Martin Lawrence has 
done nothing that would qualify him to play what ultimately is a serious 
role in a semi-dramatic film. Especially not one that transcends so many 
generations, and requires him to be as young as 20 and as old as 90. The 
same can be said of Eddie Murphy, who, despite some great comedic works 
over time, has done little of a decent dramatic nature. Fortunately, for 
the benefit of this film, they both turn out beautiful performances that 
are certainly their finest so far.
The finest acting out of the two leads comes in the later part of the 
film. As the two progressively age, and the wrinkles on their face 
multiply, you see how well Martin and Murphy have adapted to playing a 
far elder role in a very realistic manner. Not only do they change their 
mannerisms and voices, but you can truly sense a change in overall 
persona within their characters. That is certainly something you can't 
remember seeing before out of these two foul mouthed comedians.
One of the weaker elements of this film is the opening. It takes a while 
to get things into place, and the movie does a relatively poor job of 
entertaining the audience for the first 20 minutes or so, beyond some 
occasional humor. Also, in a classic, yet extremely cheap move, the 
movie skips some much needed details in order to finally get things 
going. Although you are pleased that after those 20 minutes a plot 
emerges that is consistent with the film, you still are left with a 
feeling that something is missing. One scene features the two men in a 
holding cell, optimistic that since they are truly innocent, they will 
be acquitted. The next scene is merely a judge slamming down a gavel, 
pronouncing the word "life." Now, I fully understand that the film has 
neither the time nor ability to explore a trial sequence, but this all 
could have been avoided by merely cutting the prior scene in the holding 
cell.
The ultimate question that can be posed is whether or not a film is 
quality entertainment. The answer in regards to this production is 
"yes." There is an element of fine acting by two actors with potential 
that the world did not previously know of. There is an unfortunate down 
side in the film's opening, but that is forgivable. Ultimately, the 
driving force behind Life is that it finally shows that imitation can be 
quality as well.

Title
Review for Loss of Sexual Innocence, The (1999)
Mike Figgis' The Loss of Sexual Innocence is a movie so confusing, so 
boring, and so poorly done that the Better Business Bureau should step 
in and stop any poor, unsuspecting citizen from wasting their money on 
this sad excuse for a film.
The premise of this piece of junk production that is attempting to pass 
itself off as art is nearly unrealizable. Figgis (best known for his 
critically acclaimed film, Leaving Las Vegas) takes several small 
stories involving Nic (John Cowey at age five, George Moktar at age 
twelve, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers at age 16, and Julian Sands at adult age), 
the film's central character, and interweaves them with the biblical 
tale of Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve's (Hanne Klintoe) descent from the 
Garden of Eden. There is no apparent rhyme nor reason to the order of 
assembly of these stories, nor any true connections other than a common 
loss of innocence, notably not always of a sexual nature.
Making the plot even more difficult to follow is the film's resemblance 
to many silent picture of the early 1900's, opting for a delightful 
musical score in place of dialogue. The little speech in this film is 
insignificant to the plot, or so you assume because it is almost 
entirely drowned out by the background music.
The Loss of Sexual Innocence leaves its audience asking themselves 
"Huh?" Not only is the viewer totally disillusioned, but it is works 
like this that are constantly making the line between art and junk ever 
more blurry. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been "The Loss of 
Artistic Innocence."

*** A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/bicentennial_man.htm ***
Bicentennial Man is an impuissant and confused movie that follows a 
robot through 200 years neglecting to ever develop another character in 
depth or share with the audience that the title-referenced bicentennial 
will mark the end of a journey that seems to be equally as long and 
laborious for the audience. Director Chris Columbus' film centers around 
a not-very-entertaining Robin Williams as Andrew, the aforementioned 
machine, and his trials and tribulations which are as unexplored as the 
West Indies that other guy named Columbus supposedly discovered.
In "the not too distant future" we meet the Martin family and their 
newest household appliance: Andrew. Our protagabot ventures from 
generation to generation of a cliched and overly dull Martin family- 
mostly women. He also comes across a few other humans and robots, but 
none interesting enough to warrant any attention in this review. They 
come and go, Andrew stays, and the movie limps it way through a 
Jetsons-style future setting.
Now banished to a fate worse than ordinary reruns, TV Land, there was a 
delightful 1960's Don Adams show (that Fox unsuccessfully tried to bring 
back a few years ago) called Get Smart. Richard Gautier, a relative 
unknown that never ventured past G. I. Joe fame, played Hymie the Robot. 
Much like Andrew, Hymie was a machine that actively sought life and 
commonly found himself in hilarious situations were his inner-workings 
were experimented with ineptly. Hymie was friendly and romantic, yet 
inevitably robotic. Richard Gautier may not be Robin Williams, but the 
show is just as funny and doesn't cost $7.75 and an otherwise good 
Friday or Saturday night.
The positive end of this almost-dead battery does have some traits of 
which to boast. In a time where they are rare, Bicentennial Man is a 
movie that you needn't be embarrassed to take Grandma and the tots to. 
Robin Williams is very funny and touching with some traditional Disney 
tear-jerking scenes. The explanation offered of sex is edited to a level 
of general appropriateness. But the movie is even confused about its 
family traits as we learn that being human is the ultimate 
accomplishment and you needn't mourn the dead (for all those that pass 
away, only one tear is seen). We are also told that imperfection is the 
key to life and marriage can be taken lightly.   
This film also marks 1999's Christmas time family film that most wants 
to be the next Miracle on 34th Street or It's a Wonderful Life. Last 
year, Chris Columbus entered Stepmom into this notorious yet largely 
unspoken contest, following his slightly more appealing earlier bids 
which include Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. Mr. Capra, rest assured, we 
don't need a robot to locate the West Indies.

Review for Girl Next Door, The (1999/I) (TV)
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/the_girl_next_door.htm
Always insightful, oftentimes humorous and sexy but never boring, The 
Girl Next Door is a wonderfully enjoyable documentary that will forever 
change the way you look at the pornography business and its stars. 
Following Stacey Valentine over her two year venture from an ordinary 
Oklahoman house wife to one of the biggest names in the world of adult 
cinema, the movie is an attention grabber that might just be one of the 
too few documentaries that make it big every year.
Adopted as an infant, raised in Oklahoma and abused as a child; Stacey 
Baker finds herself in a bad marriage at a young age and escapes to a 
new family in Los Angeles' world of pornography. Once in sex films, 
Stacey adapts a screen name of "Stacey Valentine" and finds her life 
split between the two Staceys. Ms. Baker seeks affection and security 
while Ms. Valentine ruthlessly goes through man after man on the silver 
screen. Stacey explains "sex is something just really hot and nasty and 
dirty and love is another thing." But her two worlds of oil and water 
clash violently when she starts dating Julian, another porn star.
The Girl Next Door reveals a lot about the adult movie industry. Viewers 
will come away from the documentary knowing trade lingo like "DP" which 
stands for "double penetration" and "Stunt Dick," both a noun and an 
adjective for the man on set who takes over if a star's penis 
doesn't work. (As an adjective, the man can "stunt dick" for the star 
and as a noun he is referred to as a "stunt dick.") Several trips to 
film sets reveal the nonchalant attitude of actors, who often have 
casual dialogue with the director and each other during there supposedly 
steamy scenes. By learning all of this through Stacey, someone that we 
get to know as a real human being, the industry no longer seems to be a 
gathering of perverts and big bucks, but rather an honest line of work.
On the other hand, the film hardly glamorizes pornography. Stacey warns 
"there are very few people that I would advise to get in the business. . 
. only if they love sex." We see her go through downs as well as ups, 
including the aforementioned bumps with Julian and, perhaps her lowest 
point, when she prostitutes herself to a fan. There is also somewhat 
disgusting footage of two plastic surgeries.
The movie is such a ravishing success because it shows all the aspects 
of Stacey and her work, both strong and vulnerable. Those not deterred 
beforehand by strong anti-pornography sentiments will enjoy this movie 
immensely. Although the year is still young, The Girl Next Door should 
be a major candidate for the best documentary of 2000.

Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth Baltimore-based film (following 
Diner, Tin Men and Avalon), is not only one of the director's stronger 
works but one of the best films of 1999.
It is 1954 and that means McCarthy is on television, the Second World 
War has been over for nine years, schools are being integrated and a 
noise-pollution called "Rock and Roll" is replacing Frank Sinatra in the 
eyes of American youth. In Liberty Heights we see how these changes 
affect the rich panoply of characters that Barry Levinson has created.
Ben (Ben Foster) is a young Jewish teenager who recalls eating at a 
friend's house when he was little and wondering what a "lunch meat" is 
and why everything is "all white." But then Ben makes a startling 
discovery about the non-Jewish population, "the other kind is about 99% 
of the world." During the year that this movie covers, Ben will find 
himself living in the new when he dresses as Adolf Hitler for Halloween; 
becomes friendly with Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), an African American girl 
in his class and becomes an instant fan of an up-and-coming rock and 
roll artist named James Brown. But not even Ben is a full-fledged 
convert as he refuses to leave a car during a Frank Sinatra song out of 
respect for The Chairmen of the Board. Ben's older brother, Van (Adrien 
Brody), also ventures into the 1950's full force when he develops a 
fierce crush on a blond-over-blue gentile girl at a Halloween party.
Ben and Van's family is soon turned upside down as a conservative 
mother, father and grandmother protest the brothers' ultra-liberal 
actions. Ada (Bebe Neuwirth who gives the most delicious yet small 
performance in a film filled with mouth-watering acting), the boys' 
mother, responds to Ben's attraction to Sylvia by exclaiming "Just kill 
me now!" Nate (Joe Montegna), the boys' honest and moral father (which 
says a lot about a man who runs the local numbers bracket) who drives 
the year's Cadillac, is firm in his position of keeping Ben home so that 
he won't trick-or-treat dressed as the Great Dictator. And the whole 
family goes at it in discussions of how the Bible should be interpreted 
and whether or not McCarthy is on a witch hunt.
Today, people continually grown about the presence of liquor, racism and 
fighting among youth. Liberty Heights offers a refreshing reminder that 
this is nothing new. Van's dream girl carries a booze-filled paper bag, 
Ben's friend Yussel fights for his religion and racially based slander 
is sprinkled all about the 1950's film.
Liberty Heights avoids the heavy drama that most studies of society 
carry and instead offers a light wit that is oftentimes funny. One of 
the more uproarious and memorable scenes centers around Van's curiosity 
of the legal system and his decision to answer "no" when asked to swear 
to the truth. The scene isn't out of place nor does it seem as 
controversial as a similar moment in The People Vs. Larry Flynt; it is a 
moment that is humorous for the purposes of developing Van's character 
and fits in the film with ease.
The movie's exploration of various music forms in the 1950's allows for 
an extraordinary soundtrack. Highlights include James Brown, Tony 
Bennett, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Louis Armstrong, 
Perry Como and Frank Sinatra.
Being released in the prime of Best Picture season, Liberty Heights will 
likely find itself under a particularly strong microscope. The first 
question asked by Hollywood tends to be one questioning a film's flaws. 
Well, this critic only discovered one where a reference to the movie 
Marty is made on Halloween, 1954, before the 1955 Best Picture's 
release. Other than that singular nitpicking, Liberty Heights can expect 
smooth sailing down the river from its theatrical release to Oscar night 
to its video release.  

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
---Once in release, a copy of this review will be posted to
http://www.moviereviews.org/erin_brockovich.htm ---
There is something about Erin Brockovich that makes it virtually impossible
for the film not to please. Perhaps it is Julia Roberts' overflowing
cleavage, perfectly round nostrils or famously plump lips that have made her
the quintessential movie star of our time. Perhaps it is director Steven
Soderbergh's deft guidance and meticulous attention to reality. Perhaps it
is the compelling story that demands the audience's respect with its early
claim of truth.
`I'm great with people' begs a desperate Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in
a job interview. She doesn't get the position. But that's nothing new; this
30-something super mom has grown accustomed to raising her three youngsters
while trying to simultaneously shield their eyes from her $16 bank account.
So when from
out of nowhere a speeding doctor's high-priced Jaguar strikes her car, a
lawsuit looks to be the answer to her problems.
Brockovich is ridiculed on the stand as her unemployment and two failed
marriages are
brought to light and the jury is convinced she's an irresponsible woman
trying to sucker a good and honest doctor out of his money. But fate works
in mysterious ways and soon Brockovich has a job . . . working for the
lawyer who lost her case.
Erin Brockovich isn't so much about the life of the woman's name it shares
as the thrilling legal battle that she wages working for the aforementioned
attorney. In filing some papers for a pro-bono real estate case, she
stumbles onto oddities that lead her to investigate mass contamination in a
small community's water supply and the multi-billion-dollar corporation that
is trying to cover it up.
The movie's only substantial flaw is that rather than dedicating all of its
time to the intriguing lawsuit, a fair amount of attention is given to
Brockovich's personal life and the old-fashioned cliché of her being married
to her job and putting her family second. The film simply doesn't need these
scenes. There is already an emotional angle as Brockovich becomes
sympathetic and friendly to the sick and dying families that have had their
life ruined by the local water supply (she even professes to know all 600 of
their phone numbers by heart). The most enjoyable scenes of the movie take
place in a back office where strategies are discussed and a conference room
where settlements are negotiated - not the bedroom where her kids complain
about her not being home for dinner.
Erin Brockovich has the potential to be a major Oscar candidate as its style
plays to the Academy's liking. What doesn't, however, is the release date.
Oscar voters traditionally love true stories like Quiz Show, A Civil Action
and, more recently, The Hurricane as well as brilliant lead female
performances like the one Roberts turns in. But the Academy's memory is
notoriously non-existent so a March release normally means a shutout on
Oscar night.
For Steven Soderbergh this might be his best work to date. Having previously
overseen sex, lies, and videotape, Out of Sight and, more recently, The
Limey, all to critical acclaim, the director seems more confident than ever
in his ninth film. Other than Roberts and teh notable Albert Finney,
Soderbergh had no major actors to work with but still manages to get mighty
performances out of his supporting cast while still keeping an appropriately
bright spotlight on his diva star.
America seems to be very interested in its own laws and how they are upheld.
John Grisham's books fly off the shelves, O. J. captivated television
audiences for over a year and Rodney King sparked riots. America is equally
fond of grade-A crowd-pleasing movies with the local cinema being a key part
of our culture. Erin Brockovich is the perfect combination of both.

Title
Review for Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)
Drop Dead Gorgeous is a sick and demented film. The jokes are so crude 
and inappropriate that you wonder whether or not the filmmakers have any 
values whatsoever (They even take cracks at young beauty pageants in the 
wake of the Jonbenet Ramsey scandal). The characters seem to be plastic, 
with no depth, but rather stereotypes guiding their every move. So will 
people hate this nauseating and disgusting outrage? At the very least it 
will cause two parts of the mind to go to war. First there is the 
well-taught, manner-minding, and always polite sub-conscious that your 
mother so valiantly programmed into you. Second you have the immature 
residue that lingers deep in the realms of your mind from your teenage 
days, still occasionally snickering at "retard" jokes. The latter will 
prevail, creating heaps of laughter and putting a smile on your face- no 
matter how undeserved .
If you thought that this summer's other fake documentary was too scary 
for your taste, this film may well fill the void. The crew of Drop Dead 
Gorgeous consists of two men sent to Mount Rose, Minnesota, small town 
USA. Annually, four people get to make "the biggest decisions of their 
lives" when they judge the local beauty pageant. Other than that, things 
are as Fargonian as they come: The accents are heavy and the big cities 
of St. Paul and Minneapolis lie not too far in the distance, but the 
town hardware store ranks far above the Mall of America on the locals' 
lists.
In Mount Rose, there is one family that seems to have all the money, the 
Leemans. Lester (Sam McMurray), the father, owns the local furniture 
store and has a particular hatred of Jews. Gladys (Kirstie Alley), the 
mother, is president of several town committees and, most importantly, 
is a former winner of the beauty pageant. Becky (Denise Richards), the 
daughter, follows in her mother's footsteps and, if Gladys gets her 
way, will be the next winner of the pageant. So just how far will Gladys 
go to get her way? Well, I never said that this movie didn't have a 
higher body count than that other fake documentary.
At the other end of the extreme spectrum lays the Atkins family (for all 
the hilarious diet jokes in the film, the potential humor that could 
come from this last name is passed by). This mother-daughter duo lives 
in a trailer, almost always accompanied by Loretta (Allison Janney), a 
friend. Amber (Kirsten Dunst), the daughter, works two jobs trying to 
support her mother (Ellen Barkin), and hopes to one day leave Mount Rose 
for a better life. Her ticket out: The pageant.
The old rule of the two biggest characters facing off at film's end 
holds true, but only after we meet some of the other pageant players. 
This is where the immature, yet hilarious, jokes pour on: a retarded 
judge, a perverted judge, a girl who speaks sign language and English 
simultaneously, a sex addict, and tons of stereotypical high school 
ditzes.
We are told early in Drop Dead Gorgeous that Mount Rose doesn't have 
any back rooms in its video stores. That comes most ironically as this 
film is a guilty pleasure, to put it lightly. I could draw comparisons 
between this film's pleasures and those of another movie involving an 
outsider entering a town (her name was Debbie, the town was Dallas), but 
this is a family review.
Editor's note: Following last week's "Editor's Note" on the MPAA, 
Moviereviews.org will now make this a regular section. Following all 
full length reviews, a paragraph or more will be added commenting on how 
the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, dealt with the film at hand. 
Hopefully this will help expose the many wrongs with that group.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is rated PG-13, meaning that tickets can be sold to 
anyone and a mild parental advisory is issued to all those with kids 
under 13. Before the credits role, the audience is treated to the 
following violations of common decency:
    a.. People being burned alive
    b.. Several acts of pre-meditated violence and murder
    c.. Curse words being flung about freely
    d.. Numerous people vomiting
    e.. A girl dancing in a provocative manner with a statue of Jesus.
    f.. Conversations about breast enlargements
    g.. A general theme of sex and violence
Kirsten Dunst recently appeared in Wag the Dog, a film rated R (No 
children under 17 without a parent or guardian). Drop Dead Gorgeous 
easily has more violence and sexual innuendo than Wag the Dog. I 
didn't count, but I would guess the curse words are a draw between the 
two films. So why the heavier rating for Wag the Dog? I don't know. 
Perhaps Jack Valenti does.

Title
Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the Dead, staring Nicholas Cage, is an 
edgy and unusual, yet solid, film. The movie, despite the absence of a 
material plot, has strong themes and character development that serve as 
a guide through a two-hour span. Those seeking deep and meaningful 
content similar to the director's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas or 
Cage's Leaving Las Vegas will not be disappointed. But those looking 
for a film that hops on the emergency room bandwagon in wake of hit 
television shows like ER, Chicago Hope and the new Third Watch may find 
this film to be too much of an intellectual challenge and are advised to 
seek their thrills in the popcorn hit Double Jeopardy.
"This film takes place in New York City in the early 90's" read the 
first words across the screen. Those 13 words and the ambulance that 
appears soon after create the film's most important character: the 
city. The audience can gather that the Big Apple is still a crime 
polluted mess in the pre-Giuliani era and that hospitals are an equally 
large issue. Just in case any doubt lingers, the film quickly shows us 
streets lined with prostitutes and hospital hallways lined with 
stretchers. From there emerges the hero, Frank Peirce (Nicholas Cage), 
an ambulance driver who has seen it all. For the next 58 hours (three 
nights, two days) Peirce will experience a variety of extreme measures, 
and the audience looks on in an almost voyeuristic fashion.
Peirce fringes on insanity throughout the film due to the numerous 
people who come into his ambulance pronounced insane and leave it 
pronounced dead. He gets them all, from the drug addicts to the suicidal 
to the "just plain nuts." This makes for an interesting juxtaposition: 
society's insane vs. society's insane workers. And then there are 
the corpses that he sees regularly, making him witness to more last 
moments than the average person's tolerance could possibly allow. Like 
all the other drivers, hebuilds an immunity, but, during these 58 hours, 
that shield is dropped.
Bringing out the Dead is sprinkled with the type of deranged and 
desperately dark humor that you only find amusing somewhere around 3:00 
AM when you are out of caffeine but forced to stay awake. Scorsese 
creates that setting so well that the jokes not only work, but you come 
to rely on their comic relief as a means of surviving the film. 
Highlights include the assorted calls that come through the ambulance 
radio (elderly woman abducted by her cat, etc..) and one scene where 
Peirce and eccentric fellow driver (Ving Rhames) find a supposedly dead 
victim, but stage a dramatically overdone revival for his stoned 
friends.
This summer, another legendary director gave us his look at New York 
City by following a character over a period of a few days. In Eyes Wide 
Shut, Stanley Kubrick portrayed an upper-class, secretive and perverse 
society that seemed to function completely on its own. Scorsese's look 
into paramedics is very similar. The men we meet run the night shift and 
find themselves isolated from society. They know each other, recognize 
their peers' ins and outs and are even accustomed to some of the same 
drug and alcohol calls from people who never learn their lesson and 
revolve in and out of the hospital doors.
Another summer film set in New York City showed the power of using 
contrasting music and scenes. Throughout Summer of Sam, as people would 
be brutally murdered on the streets, bright and uplifting music would 
dominate the moment. In Bringing out the Dead a whole panoply of tracks 
come into play. Stretchers, crying families and bloody scenes are 
accompanied by Van Morrison, R. E. M., The Who, UB40, Martha Reeves & 
The Vandellas and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (famous in part for 
another New York film, the Woody Allen classic Manhattan).
Bringing out the Dead is a thought-provoking and powerful film. Like the 
other cerebral movie at a theatre near you, American Beauty, this 
production can look for a prolonged box office run with no leading 
numbers but a positive buzz to give it stable positioning. Early on, 
Peirce tells us "I am good at my job." So is Martin Scorsese.

Title
Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://moviereviews.org/the_talented_mr__ripley.htm---
The most impressive part of The Talented Mr. Ripley isn't Matt Damon's
excellent performance or the picturesque Italian scenery, but rather
the abnormally disturbing chills that commence running down your spine
at the 10-minute juncture of the two-hour-plus film.
Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) is a playboy in the truest of senses. He
lives in Italy off of the allowance his father provides, dates a
beautiful girl named Marge Sherwood (Academy Award Winner Gwyneth
Paltrow) and cheats on her constantly. But Dickie's father, Herbert
(James Rebhorn), isn't blind to his son's laziness and decides to do
something about it when he meets Tom Ripley (Matt Damon). The meeting
is really just a big misunderstanding, since Tom is wearing a borrowed
Princeton jacket that leads Herbert to assume he was Dickie's
classmate. Before long, Tom is given $1000 (a lot of money in the
1950's setting) to find Dickie in Italy and bring him back to his
father.  Although the film's trailer has no qualms about giving away
almost every twist and turn of the movie, I won't. I will only reveal
that Ripley is indeed talented and "would rather be a fake somebody
than a real nobody."  Dickie Greenleaf is a somebody.
One of the unnecessary characters in the film is Meredith Logue (Cate
Blanchett). Meredith is a playgirl who shuns her family's name and
money but clearly couldn't survive without the socialite status that
both provide.  She wanders in and out of the plot according to when it
is convenient to have her around and could be edited out altogether in
favor of a shorter and more concise film. The only drawback to
splicing Meredith away is that Cate Blanchett gives a remarkable
performance that over-shadows the more prominent Gwyenth Paltrow. This
is most ironic since Paltrow stole Blanchett's much deserved Best
Actress Oscar for Elizabeth when she won for her mediocre-at-best
performance in Shakespeare in Love.
The other standout is Matt Damon who confirms his status as one of the
finer up-and-coming actors with Good Will Hunting, Rounders, Saving
Private Ryan and now this under his belt. He makes Ripley an eerie and
frightening character while, at the same time, maintaining a sort of
dorky persona and managing to not overdue some rather subtle
homosexual themes. His character's success at becoming someone he
isn't is half due to his talent and half due to his luck. Damon smirks
just the right way when he catches a serendipitous break and uses
these fortunes to make the character all the more eerie and the film
all the more disturbing.
The Talented Mr. Ripley beautifully captures the essence of Italy. The
film's remarkable cinematography should go head-to-head with Anna and
the King on Oscar night. Scenes in Venice's St. Marx Square, Rome's
Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Steps) and other Italian landmarks are
magnificently shot and even compete with the actors onscreen for
attention.
The movie has many similarities to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great
Gatsby.  Not the least of which is the concept of someone who obtains
money through illegitimate means by trying to be someone they're
not. This holds true of both Tom Ripley and Dickie here. The lavish
socialite lifestyles portrayed are similar and so is the deep, dark
secrets that just about everyone has.  Just don't confuse yourself,
The Talented Mr. Ripley may be good, but if you expect something on
par with The Great Gatsby, you will be sorely disappointed.

Title
Review for Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/snow_falling_on_cedars_-_review.htm 
Despite being a visual marvel and cinematic triumph, Snow Falling on 
Cedars is ultimately a failure in terms of living up to its potential 
and expectations. That Universal is marketing this film for Best Picture 
is an insult to the Academy's intellect. The production does have 
moments of glory, namely riveting courtroom scenes and the 
aforementioned cinematography.
It is December, 1950 in the state of Washington and prejudice runs thick 
among locals. One morning an American body is found murdered at sea. The 
man soon standing trial is Japanese. To Kill A Mock85oops, sorry, I =
mean Snow Falling on Cedars focuses on the obvious racism involved. As 
someone points out of the trial "Every once in a while, somewhere in the 
world, humanity goes on trial."
The film is based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. Humor 
aside, there is a strong argument that this work is little more than a 
poorly disguised adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. The only major 
difference is that in To Kill a Mockingbird the stories and characters 
outside of the trial are well developed and intriguing. Here they are 
like a random collage. In that sense, Snow Falling on Cedars is more 
like Mike Figgis' awful film The Loss of Sexual Innocence where footage 
of unrelated stories was shot and randomly assembled on an editing 
table.
The court scenes are truly excellent and even solicit memories of 
classics like Inherit the Wind. Max Von Sydow plays Nels Gudmundson, the 
defense lawyer. Like the brilliant Dustin Hoffman in Sleepers, he is 
shaky and visually unintimidating. But when his character goes after 
witnesses it is truly a classic courtroom drama. Von Sydow should be 
applauded and may even see his name as a long shot Best Supporting Actor 
nomination. Equally magnificent is James Cromwell as the presiding 
judge, determined to have a trial without prejudice.
Snow Falling on Cedars is a genuinely attractive film. The 
title-descriptive winter scenery could easily comprise a calendar (a 
rarity for any image absent a semi-nude woman in the 90's.) 
Interestingly, the camera is almost always either focussed on a 
person's face or a large, rich scene. There are very few half-way 
shots. These facial portraits are further enhanced by being only half 
lit, yin-yang style. Unfortunately even this engaging technique sheds 
light on a flaw: everyone's makeup is perfect. When people sweat, cry 
or are just themselves, their faces are a little too beautiful to be 
believed.
The court scenes are particularly effective because the script creates a 
genuine hatred towards certain prejudice characters. Not since Jack 
Nicholson's riveting performance in A Few Good Men has a film been so 
effective at creating such feelings towards a witness. Just as facial 
portraits reveal unrealistic makeup, dE9j=E0 vu of that 1991 production =
is a too strong to be ignored. The pinnacle of this is when a witness is 
questioned about their phone calls in the same manner that Tom Cruise 
bombarded Nicholson some eight years ago.
It is most unfortunate that courtroom drama, excellent acting and visual 
ecstasy like this must be ruined by murky plot lines and poor 
adaptation. Ironically, yin-yang is more than just some characters' 
portraits, it is an underlying theme of Snow Falling on Cedars.

Title
Review for God Said 'Ha!' (1998)
Sharp, witty and charming, God Said Ha! is a pleasure to watch. The film 
strikes a particularly refreshing cord with its down-to-earth, realistic 
subject matter: A woman who finds herself in the prime of her life, then 
encounters a change so awful, so upsetting, and so unfair; that she discovers 
humor beneath all the misery that surrounds her.  
Julia Sweeney is 30-something years old, recently divorced, and ready to 
leave New York City. She saves up some cash, buys herself the ultimate 
bachelor-pad outside of Los Angeles, and prepares for the first day of the 
rest of her life. Just when she thinks that nothing could get in her way, 
everything does.
Julia's brother becomes ill with cancer and soon requires constant attention. 
Not only does he move in with her, but both her parents do as well. She finds 
herself sneaking around like a teenager, returning to the ways of her 
childhood. (Like having to say "Noodles with the red topping" since "Pasta 
with marinara sauce" is too formal.)
The film is based on a play written by Sweeney, which had a successful run on 
the west coast. She is the only person on stage, except for a brief 
appearance by Quentin Tarantino at the end. There is no real set other than a 
few scattered pieces of furniture. 
It would be a misconception to assume that since Sweeney is a Saturday Night 
Live alumni, and did appear in two rather unfortunate SNL films (It's Pat and 
Stuart Saves his Family), that this movie is of a like  nature. She seems to 
have fully shed all the mediocre aspects of Lorne Michael's films, and found 
her own style. Not only do all the jokes work well, but the cheesy and often 
embarrassing aspects of  the aforementioned titles are absent. 
God Said Ha! is a wonderful movie. Whether it be the jokes about disappearing 
ovaries, or the touching stories of a terminally ill man; this film is well 
worth a look.          

Title
Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
--- A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/cradle_will_rock.htm ---
There are some simple rules to making a feature film. They include: 1)
Try to avoid venturing over the two-hour mark. 2) Don't rip the plot
out of a history textbook. 3) Use a lead actor.
Cradle Will Rock violates all three of those rules. The work is over
two hours long, rips its plot out of the Great Depression chapter in
textbooks and uses nearly 15 supporting actors in lieu of a lead role.
The odds of a movie with the aforementioned infractions of common
practice being decent are about the same as a little Italian man who
speaks fractured English beating out Tom Hanks for Best Actor. Well,
Benigni not only won the honor but literally walked on Steven
Spielberg in doing so. Cradle Will Rock not only gets away with the
no-nos, but achieves absolute brilliance in the process.
It is the 1930's and the Great Depression has divided American into
the minority wealthy and the majority poor. In an attempt to provide
cheap entertainment for the masses and save an institution known as
Broadway, the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) is born. The mission is to
provide talented, trained and experienced actors and crew members with
jobs.
Marc Blizenstein (Hank Azaria), with the aid of sleepless
hallucinations, pens a show titled Cradle Will Rock. Orson Welles
(Angus Macfadyen) directs the piece after Hallie Flanagan (Cherry
Jones), the director of FTP, decides to produce it. Cast members
include a poor but pride-filled actor (John Torturro) and a homeless
street singer who catches a break (Emily Watson).
There is a problem with Cradle Will Rock, however. It is
pro-union. Lest we forget that Martin Dies is leading a pre-McCarthy
committee investigating possible incidents of communism and FTP is
already under examination in the most notorious witch-hunt in American
history.
The film's suporting character overdose is actually countered by the
history book issue; since the actors are wonderful playing people we
are familiar with, much of the movie works itself out. Azaria's grasp
on Blitzstein is marvelous, John Cusack's take of Nelson Rockefeller
is extremely noteworthy, Ruben Blades' Diego Rivera is fabulous and,
most impressively, Bill Murray plays Tommy Crickshaw in a convincing
and oftentimes chilling manner.
Another interesting actor in the cast is Philip Baker Hall. The
veteran actor seems to have struck gold this year, appearing not only
in this fine film but The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Insider and
Magnolia as well. It is conceivable that he could appear in three, if
not four, of the 1999 Best Picture nominates films.
If all this sounds semi-chaotic, that's probably because it
is. Keeping track of all the film's characters, their issues and the
politics is indeed challenging. However, what is being shown in the
movie is a time of equally dense chaos and uncertainty. Director Tim
Robbins should be credited, not blamed, for properly portraying the
realistic setting of his subject matter.

Title
Review for High Fidelity (2000)
---This review will be published to
http://www.moviereviews.org/high_fidelity.htm on Friday, March 31, 2000, the
film's release date---
Here's the good news: Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jack Black are
excellent in their supporting roles. Here's the bad news: the trio are
responsible for 100% of the all-too-rare laughter in the movie. This is a
major problem for an already hurting High Fidelity, yet another
midlife-crisis saga involving old girlfriends and supposedly deep
meditations like `what came first  music or misery?' The movie offers the
audience plenty of both.
Rob (John Cusack) is depressed because his love life has proven to be
disaster after disaster. His latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), a
rather plain-looking blonde woman with a slight British accent, has just
walked out and Rob's self-therapy is to reminisce over his top five breakups
of all time. Actually, he finds a way to turn everything into a top five
list even though the Letterman-style jokes always fail to land.
Rob ultimately reaches the conclusion that in order to move forward, he must
resolve the past. (There's a new one!) His voyage from ex-girlfriend to
ex-girlfriend quickly becomes as dim and hopelessly misguided as Christopher
Columbus' (Look! The West Indies!). But the filmmakers seem totally
oblivious to the fact that Rob is uninteresting and sail on into dangerously
unentertaining waters.
Fortunately, Jack Black enters as Barry, an overly cynical employee of the
record store that Rob owns. Black, a slightly more petite version of Chris
Farley with the same energy and roll-in-the-aisles sarcasm, shows up on
screen every so often, thus keeping the film from sinking into the pits of
Hollywood's absolute worst. Unfortunately, the other record store employee,
Dick (Todd Louiso), does little to further the film's humor or plot, proving
to be an unnecessary timesuck in an already overlong production.
Tim Robbins plays the new boyfriend of, Laura, Rob's latest breakup. The
character, unlike most in the movie, is very well written with a certain Zen
quality that makes for a hilarious misfit in the edgy 90's environment.
Robbins conquers it well with his usual competence, despite being surrounded
by utter incompetence.
Catherine Zeta-Jones portrays Charlie, one of the five great breakups of Rob
's life. Aside from being the most attractive person in this film (not even
a close call), Zeta-Jones somehow transforms her poorly written character
into a mildly intriguing interlude of Rob's past and present. The other
former girlfriends are dull, boring and clichéd (although points should be
awarded for making the only other semi-attractive one a film critic).
Where the movie does score big is its soundtrack, although such is the norm
for music-related films. The press notes list some 59 tunes. Highlights
include a couple of Lou Reed songs performed by Velvet Underground, an Elton
John number and Queen's triumphant `We Are the Champions.'
High Fidelity also seems to have some problems creating a realistic setting.
Except for one night club scene, it appears that the filmmakers forgot to
hire extras for their ordinarily busy background setting of Chicago.
High Fidelity, which I admit not having read, was a successful book probably
because it tapped a certain psychological truth much like Salinger did in
the landmark The Catcher in the Rye. But Holden Caulfield has never made it
to film because the production would get too confusing trying to follow such
mental ramblings; trying to track Rob has the same problems causing the
audience to get lost and, ultimately, bored.
At one point, Rob ponders `Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable
or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?' I don't know. But I do
know this: I didn't see this movie because I was miserable that evening, I
was miserable that evening because I saw this movie. And if you mistakenly
venture out to see this movie, you will quickly learn that misery loves
company.

Review for Sweet and Lowdown (1999)
--- A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/sweet_and_lowdown.htm ----
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---
It comes as little surprise that Woody Allen, one of great filmmakers of 
the our time, has created another gem in Sweet and Lowdown. It ain't 
Manhattan or Annie Hall, but it is at the top of 1999's  class, a strong 
statement about the filmmaker's talent.   
Allen has previously ventured into risquE9 territory when he had =
characters break role in Annie Hall and made Celebrity, a 1998 film, in 
black and white. Here he has created a mockumentary that is infinitely 
more realistic than The Blair Witch Project and might even create some 
consequent believers.
The film opens with Woody Allen being interviewed about a jazz guitarist 
named Emmet Ray who briefly flourished in the 1930's but is mainly 
remembered only by aficionados. Soon Allen and other interviewee's 
stories are acted out in segments by a typically recognizable Woody 
Allen cast including Sean Penn, John Waters and Uma Thurman. These bits 
are intertwined with continued interviews.  
The assumption made is that this guitarist, Emmet Ray, was a major 
insider influence and Allen has decided to make a movie paying tribute 
to him. Ray was an oddball who got kicks out of watching trains, 
shooting rats and performing drunk. But he was the finest guitarist in 
the world and he knew it. . . "except for this gypsy guitar player in 
France," as he always had to insert. The gypsy in question was Django 
Reinhardt and Emmet twice fainted in his presence. The film follows 
Emmet through a couple of women, including one mute girl, and his 
experiences as a musician, hustler and part time pimp.
There is absolutely no reason that any of the things in Sweet and 
Lowdown couldn't have happened. But they didn't. Emmet Ray is work of 
pure fiction, although there was, undisputedly, a major jazz scene in 
the 1930's and a great guitarist named Django Reinhardt. Allen follows 
through with this fantasy to the point of even having the experts being 
interviewed disagree on certain issues. There is little doubt that at 
least one moviegoer will embarrass him or herself in the near future by 
requesting an Emmet Ray album in Sam Goody.
Emmet's personality is well expressed even beyond dead rats and speeding 
trains. He is also a kleptomaniac, something that probably serves to 
feed his monster sized ego. He won't allow himself to ever fall in love, 
but doesn't mind having girls live with him. Yet the guitarist also 
manages to justify all his wrongs in his own sick and twisted head. His 
extremely undesirable traits makes the supposed documentary all the more 
insightful.
Woody Allen's films, more often than not, mirror himself. In many ways, 
Emmet Ray is just an exaggerated reflection of the brilliant filmmaker. 
He has odd female companions in the aforementioned mute girl and other 
cartoon-like companions, works a small but appreciative music scene and 
is one of the best at his trait. Allen certainly has an abnormal female 
life that has come to light recently, continues to make independent 
films for an appreciative art-house crowd and is, indisputably, one of 
the greatest at what he does.

Title
Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/mission_to_mars.htm ---
Mission to Mars is, simply put, an instant popcorn classic. It is a movie to
be seen by the masses over and over; the type of production that will be
applauded by audiences everywhere despite critics' reviews and re-released
every so often in order for each generation to take in its full big-screen
glory.
It's not a new idea - intelligent life elsewhere. Neither is a rescue
mission into the dark realms of space nor a patriotic mid-film moment when
an American flag is hoisted into alien soil. Actually, very little in
Mission to Mars is original at all. It is the combination of these grandiose
sci-fi ideas, some of the most mystifying special effects ever produced, and
Brian DePalma's ability to mix what previous directors Stanley Kubrick and
Steven Spielberg offered with his own awesome visions, that make this movie
so utterly amazing.
First, credit the film for not wasting anytime getting started. The only
scene in the entire production that takes place on earth is the obligatory
opening where the heroes bid their families tearful good-byes. The next
setting: Mars, an unlucky 13 months later. Within moments of the four
crewmembers landing, a force like none other sweeps them off their feet and
tears their puny bodies into thousands of pieces (and yes, the
holier-than-now MPAA rated this movie PG!). But the leader, Luc Goddard (Don
Cheadle of Boogie Nights fame), transmits an SOS signal following the
chaotic fiasco - suggesting that he might still be alive. Soon a rescue
mission is underway.
So what happened on the red planet? Well, I don't like to give too much
away, but I will share that the folks over at Disney (Touchstone) assigned
the following tagline to the film: `For centuries we've searched for the
origin of human life on Earth. . .We've been looking on the wrong planet.'
There are plenty of cheesy moments that will give the overly cynical a
reason to chuckle; they won't laugh with the movie, but rather at it.
However, those moments are necessary  this is a true epic. The movie wouldn
't be nearly as powerful, nor as enjoyable, without the hokey romance, last
second saves or dramatic connect-the-dots conclusions.
Perhaps you will see this film and find yourself among its critics. Perhaps
you will snicker with your friends at the overly cheesy moments. Perhaps you
will dismiss its likely huge box office income as being akin to that of
Titanic. Fine. But I challenge you to wake up the next morning and tell me
that you weren't mystified as you lay in bed that night or that this film
hasn't changed the way you look at the stars.

Review for Ready to Rumble (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/ready_to_rumble.htm ---
Allow me to begin this review by apologizing. If this critique seems to be
below par in terms of quality, it is because I am confident that I am now a
great deal dumber having seen Ready to Rumble. Perhaps this is the film's
intent, to reduce educated persons to a level of idiocy, thus creating an
even playing field for those hardcore wrestling fans who will see the movie
because they have confidence that their sport is as real as any. Or perhaps,
in the more likely scenario, the film has no real intent whatsoever other
than to spew juvenile sight gags and jokes derived in the 4th grade boy's
bathroom through a vehicle as troubled as the leaky septic truck that the
production's protagonists drive.
Furthermore, I should let you know that this critique will contain no
intellectual interpretation whatsoever as the film has no such depth to
interpret. I dare even suggests that the filmmakers' concept of `highbrow'
is probably someone whose face expands while on an acid trip. At one point
one of the main characters ponders `if you only have one nut left, is it
still your left nut?' That is just about as deep as things get.
The film's heroes are Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott
Caan), two twenty-something wrestling fans obsessed with Jimmy `The King'
King (Oliver Platt). To give you an idea of just how annoying this duo can
be, if I were given a choice between spending an afternoon with them or
watching a Sylvester Stallone marathon, I would grab some popcorn and make
myself comfy.
The duo soon see their champion go down in the ring and set out on a mission
to rescue him and return him to his previous glory. But there are a few
problems: The king's castle is a stolen trailer, he owes child support, his
wife has a certain disease which I am too much of a gentleman to discuss in
this review and his thirst isn't for victory but rather beer.
The film's morals are about as wholesome as those belonging to Charles
Manson, the serial killer who is the punch line of the movie's only funny
joke. The continuous preaching of violence as not only a means to an end but
a positive trait as well is simply inexcusable. This is especially
distressing given that the production targets a young and very
impressionable teenage audience with several cameos by professional
wrestlers and a PG-13 rating.
When in doubt about something, the movie's main characters ask themselves a
simple question: `What would King do?' (Not to be mistaken with the much
funnier question asked of Brian Boitano in South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.) So what would the idiotic King do? Hmmm. . .have the brains to see a
different movie.

Title
Review for Pokémon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at =
http://www.moviereviews.org/pokemon_the_first_movie.htm
There are only two explanations for why anyone would make Pokemon: The 
First Movie: alien abduction or drugs.
Children were running around, waiting to get in hours before the movie 
started; one parent openly contemplated "How are we going to keep track 
of our kids?" Then the film began and near-deafening levels of applause 
were heard at the very sight of the opening credits. From there it was 
all downhill. Before long, people were walking out and cries of "I want 
to go home" replaced the children's glee. To say that the movie was a 
bomb would not do it justice. The movie was more like a bomb that is 
accidentally dropped at the wrong time over a country's closest ally, 
who just happens to have a massive nuclear arsenal and short temper.
The movie actually begins with a short film meant to introduce the 
audience to the world of Pokemon; a place filled with fictional 
characters, strange powers and human masters. Unfortunately, the film 
appeared to be little more than a fairy tale gone horribly astray. The 
characters' language was absolutely undecipherable and sheer pandemonium 
dominated the moment. The morals displayed for the film's young audience 
were despicable, including scenes where all the characters would point, 
stare and laugh at some poor creature who had fallen down. Worst of all, 
the piece doesn't accomplish its goal. Not only is the audience no 
closer to understanding the world of Pokemon, but the all-important 
first impression sets a negative tone that is constant throughout the 
feature film.
The nadir of all kids' movies this decade has a plot that makes that of 
Mission: Impossible seem self-explanatory. From the little that can be 
gathered, the Pokemon universe is in grave danger. Mew, an extinct 
Pokemon, has been cloned by an evil human and the result is Mewtwo, a 
Pokemon that is absolutely evil and more powerful than any other. The 
creature comes with the standard villain-sized ego, boasting "Behold my 
powers! I am the strongest Pokemon in the world." This creation then 
takes on all other Pokemon in a battle that is haplessly drawn out 
over much of the film's duration.
The production does use some techniques displayed in older, and more 
successful, movies. Gloomy colors and equally dark music act as constant 
tip-offs that evil is approaching. Some sewer scenes wreak of borrowed 
elements from the old Ninja-Turtles television series. A little palm 
communicator appears to be more like something Q would use in a 007 film 
than these annoying little creatures have a right to play around with. 
And the memorable moment in Star Wars, that was tastefully recycled in 
Men in Black, of a bunch of strange looking creatures hanging around 
nonchalantly (Star Wars was in a bar, Men in Black in headquarters), is 
not so tastefully exhibited here.
At the end of the film, Mewtwo suggests to all the other Pokemon 
"Perhaps for you, these events are best forgotten." So be it.
---EDITORIAL CRITICISM OF THE MPAA---
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated Pokemon: The 
First Movie "G." That is the lowest possible rating and means that the 
film may be seen by anyone and everyone.
Pokemon: The First Movie displays considerable amounts of violence. 
The entire plot is dependant on hand-to-hand style combat. Although 
there is a moral solution to this fighting at film's end, it is too 
little and too late. It must also be pointed out that the numerous 
people who will walk out mid-movie will never receive this anti-violence 
message anyway.
Another film opening this weekend, The Insider, was rated "R". That 
means that anyone under 17 who wishes to see the film must do so with a 
parent or guardian. The Insider is a true story that people read about 
in unrated newspapers a few years ago. The only remotely questionable 
aspect of the movie is foul language.
I guess what the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, are trying to say 
is that fighting in a deranged and far-fetched film is okay for everyone 
to see but a real life story with real life language should only be seen 
by adults.

Title
Review for My Dog Skip (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/my_dog_skip.htm ---
For melodrama lovers still weeping the death of Bambi's mother, My Dog
Skip is the perfect film. Ditto parents looking for wholesome and
oftentimes cute material for their kids. But for those seeking popcorn
entertainment, adult fare or typical March trash, the last word of the
title should serve as a subliminal hint.
"My fondest memories are from my childhood days," explains Willie
Morris (Frankie Muniz of television's Malcolm in the Middle). Those
days began with a lonely nine-years-old Willie seeing his 20-something
best friend (Luke Wilson) depart to join American soldiers overseas in
World War Two. They would end with his best friend being the dog who
lends his name to the film's title and Willie's popularity among local
youth being far greater than anyone could have imagined. In-between he
would have fights with his "stern and overbearing" father, befriend
the cutest girl in town, uncover an illegal bootlegging operation and
witness a member of Bambi's type take one in the chest. Through all of
this, he would grow up.
Willie Morris penned the autobiographical book that became this
movie. After those days of French invasions, childhood crushes and
good ol' Skip, Morris became an accomplished author and served as
editor of Harper's Magazine for seven years. He passed away in August,
1999 - just months before the premiere of My Dog Skip.
The plot of the film is reminiscent of both Forrest Gump and Dennis
the Menace. As an unpopular only child against a background setting of
real events, Morris seems a lot like Gump; his girlfriend is equally
suggestive of Jenny. But the suburban life with nest-door neighbors
and sling-shots leads you to wonder why he doesn't have that one
strand of hair aimed at Ra.
Frankie Muniz seems to be the hottest new kid actor in Hollywood with
Malcolm in the Middle garnering both critical and popular
acclaim. Unfortunately, this overly-sentimental role proves a tad
heavy for the relatively inexperienced star and the result is numerous
emotional scenes losing their oomph because of his obvious
confusion. On a brighter note, however, Kevin Bacon (the center of the
movie universe) and Diane Lane (recently in the under-appreciated A
Walk on the Moon) turn in grade-A performances as our protagonist's
parents.
In wake of the overly-violent Pokémon and mediocre-at-best Tigger
Movie, My Dog Skips proves to be the first film since Toy Story 2 that
the tots can see without objection. This movie doesn't have as much to
offer on multiple levels as the November hit and is a less cheery
piece - but it is a genuine family film and those are hard to come by
these days.

Title
Review for Diamonds (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/diamonds.htm ---
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.---
Diamonds is a thoroughly enjoyable piece which owes its success to a 
remarkable ensemble cast and beautiful script that wisely shies away 
from devilish cliches and over-the-top poignancy for which many 
similar relationship films sell their souls. Those seeking a masculine 
version of movies like Anywhere But Here and fans of stars Kirk Douglas, 
Dan Akroyd and Lauren Bacall as well as teens seeking a peak of Jenny 
McCarthy (who keeps her clothes on- well, sort of anyway) should find 
this movie to be a true treat.
Harry (Kirk Douglas), Lance (Dan Akroyd) and Michael (Corbin Allred) 
represent three generations of the same family. Harry, once a boxer 
known as the Polish Prince, fondly remembers his days as the 
welterweight champion of the world. He hasn't had sex in 8 years. Lance 
is somewhere in his midlife crisis as he fights for his son's attention 
and respect despite a recent divorce. He hasn't had sex since his wife 
and he split up. Michael is battling high school and coping with the 
aforementioned divorce. He has only been to second base once.
The three generations set out on a road trip to Reno, Nevada in search 
of precious diamonds that lend the film its title. With Reno comes one 
of the most enjoyable casino scenes since Dustin Hoffman counted cards 
in Rain Man (Lance cheats at poker in a most amusing fashion), an 
unforgettable trip to a bordello that occupies nearly 1/3 of the film 
and mended relationships among the three once angry relatives.
Kirk Douglas plays a stroke victim who insists that his condition is 
merely "G-d's way of trying to make me shut up." Douglas is truly 
inspiring and it would not be unjust for him to receive a best actor 
nomination accordingly. Dan Akroyd reprises his 
confused-but-well-meaning-father role previously seen in both My Girl 
movies. In doing so, he shows that, despite enormous name recognition, 
he is one of Hollywood's most underused assets. The biggest surprise 
comes from a rather small role tackled by former Playmate Jenny McCarthy 
as, surprisingly enough, a call-girl. She shows the expected sexual 
character that her role calls for as well as a very sweet, 
girl-next-door persona that give her scenes an added oomph and her 
character more depth than any whore since Julia Roberts' lead role in 
Pretty Woman. Lauren Bacall rounds out the grade-A cast playing a madam.
Harry, the former boxer, was never a heavyweight. Rather, he was a 
welterweight at the top of his division. Similarly, Diamonds isn't a 
heavyweight film. There are no massive effects or even $20 million 
stars. But don't be mistaken, the film is at the top of its league and 
can still deliver a knock-out punch.

Title
Review for Stepmom (1998)
Every holiday season a film will come out that is attempting to be the 
next Miracle on 34th Street or It's A Wonderful Life. The content will 
be values and morals. And the plot's predictability will be none less 
than that of this annual event. Recently, director Chris Columbus has 
been behind several of these films such as Home Alone and Mrs. 
Doubtfire. So, as tradition may have neither gaps nor breaks, this 
year's wannabe movie is Stepmom, directed by, appropriately enough, 
Chris Columbus.
The unadvertised plot of Stepmom is coping with the harshest of things 
that life has to offer; in this case it is cancer. The advertised plot 
is dealing with divorced life and the children involved; which does fall 
under the larger theme as well. And of course, just to insure that this 
movie doesn't break the trend, there are scenes that will cause you to 
laugh, and others to cry.
Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) have made the decision to 
divorce long before the film starts. They have 2 children, one is a 12 
year old girl, Anna (Jena Malone), and the other a significantly younger 
boy, Ben (Liam Aiken). Their lives seem to have adjusted to this 
divorce, and just when a degree of stability is beginning to exist, Luke 
has his younger girlfriend, Isabel (Julia Roberts), move in. Devoted to 
her work as a photographer, Isabel never dreamed of playing Mom, but now 
living with 2 children part of the time, she will be forced to adjust. 
That is where the movie picks up.
Stereotypically, the kids don't want to except Isabel, and in their 
minds she will never stack up to the job of their full time mother, 
Jackie. The movie becomes an artificial study of acceptance in life, and 
plays out several very two dimensional Hollywood type scenarios. But 
then, just when you have calculated the ending, and can predict every 
scene ahead of time, the movie inserts it's one bold surprise. (WARNING: 
Partial Plot Giveaway) As viewers of Terms of Endearment once saw, those 
who see this will as well. Jackie is terminally ill with cancer. 
Although this is the one non-predictable move of the film, everything 
related to it is. And so it that the lives of these 5 people are 
changed, and they must cope with just another situation on top of all 
those that they currently do.
When you put 3 talented people like Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris and Julia 
Roberts together on screen, there will almost always be chemistry and 
extraordinary acting. This is no exception. Sarandon gives her best 
performance since her Academy Award winning role in Dead Man Walking. 
Roberts is solid as well, and seems to enjoy playing her young, rock n' 
roll obsessed character. The kids' roles don't have much room to shine, 
but the relatively new Jena Malone (Contact) is wonderfully charming. 
However, the real treat is Ed Harris in his second great job of the year 
(The Truman Show). He is believable, enjoyable, and all around great in 
his role.
When all is said and done, Stepmom offers very little that is new or 
unique, beyond some great acting. However, as worn out as it may be, the 
overly predictable plot is still enjoyable and entertaining. Adding a 
serious twist with Jackie is a bold, fairly new step for this genre that 
deserves applause. Is it worth the time and money? I suppose so, but 
waiting for video wouldn't hurt either.

Review for Anna and the King (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://moviereviews.org/anna_and_the_king.htm
If 1999 is the year of new filmmaking, consider Anna and the King proof 
that the old formula still works. The movie is an epic of epic 
proportions in that tradition of masterpieces like The Last Emperor, Out 
of Africa and Gone with the Wind.
Based on the renowned musical, The King and I, Anna and the King is the 
tale of a woman, Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster), who does the unthinkable 
of a woman in the mid-1800's: she takes her son halfway across the world 
to Siam where she becomes a school teacher. Even more outrageous is her 
speaking directly to and refusing to bow to the King of Siam (Chow 
Yun-Fat), something no lady has ever done before.
Anna is accepted by the King who finds wisdom in her practices and 
privately considers her his equal. The class she has come to teach is 
not one of peasants, nor even rich, but rather the 58 royal offspring 
plus her own son. The movie is a tale of a woman who dares to do the 
unthinkable time and again, how people view her, how the King views her 
and how her new home of Siam is facing political tasks equally as 
impossible as the thought of a woman surviving in the King's court.
A movie of such grandness must have an equally magnificent appearance. 
Shot entirely in Malaysia, director of photography Caleb Deschanel 
captures breathtaking scenery that makes the film a near-lock for the 
Best Cinematography award. Director Andy Tennant matches the incredible 
imagery with numerous well-choreographed extras and a Kubrickian 
attention to details that creates a flawless appearance. It is big 
screen movies like this that will always give Hollywood an edge over 
independent works.
For Jodie Foster this is her finest performance since 1991's The Silence 
of the Lambs and she owes many thanks to a co-star who is one of the 
year's best actors in his breakthrough performance. Chow Yun-Fat has 
come a long way from his days being advertised as "International Action 
Star." The unforgettable scenes in the King's court wouldn't be as rich 
without an excellent King nor as intriguing minus a witty teacher. The 
extras who play the King's children are convincing while still 
maintaining a cute "awe" quality that sets the tone for a film sprinkled 
with a delightfully innocent humor.
For two and half-hours, Anna and the King completely engages its 
audience. The film isn't long; it just takes its time. Because the movie 
takes its time, the actors are able to play their roles to a level of 
completeness; sweeping camera shots and a strong background score can 
captivate the audience without being prematurely cut off and the movie 
is able to establish itself as the last great epic of the 20th Century, 
a fitting title for a movie made by 20th Century Fox.

Review for Isn't She Great (2000)
---A copy of thsi review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/isn't_she_great.htm ---
Isn't She Great? No. Good? Nah. Mediocre? Not exactly. Borderline awful? 
Bingo.
Disclosure: I have neither read nor seen Valley of the Dolls, the book 
which made Jacqueline Susann famously trashy. Going into this movie, 
which is a many-liberties-taken adaptation of her biography, I had 
absolutely no intentions of checking out the sleazy novel or film 
anytime soon. The movie/book have now skyrocketed to the top of 
must-see/must-read list. That is the peculiar thing about Isn't She 
Great: the movie, atrocious as it is, makes you thrive its coveted 
subject material. Don't credit the film. Credit Susann.
Jacqueline Susann (Bette Midler) is a New York Jew with a dream of being 
famous. Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) is a New York Jew who's character 
isn't well-explained at all. For some reason, Irving craves Jacqueline 
(keep in mind that Midler is hardly a slender sex-star) and marries her 
under the condition that he make her famous. (Don't think Jacqueline is 
quick to marry though, she does seek G-d's approval when she drags 
Irving to Central Park and talks to a tree- something that doesn't look 
that odd for Central Park.)
Jacqueline, who admits "All I know about are aging astars, hopeful 
hookers and people popping pills and winding up in the gutter," is 
rather untalented in the performing arts. So, as history dictates, she 
earns her fame by writing about her aforementioned knowledge of a sleazy 
industry. En route to her pinnacle, there comes the humorless editor 
(David Hyde Pierce), who does the unthinkable when he orders mayonnaise 
in a deli, and assorted other characters that more closely resemble 
cliches and caricatures than real people.
How can a true story be accused of over-characterization and being too 
cliche filled? I quote the press notes when speaking of how the 
filmmakers "decided to loosen up the story a bit to make room for  the 
film they all wanted to make." So just how loosened were things? Well, 
this story isn't supposed to be a comedy, but the writers made it one. 
In becoming the comedy into which it has no right morphing, Isn't She 
Great finds its most serious problem. Jacqueline had cancer. Her son was 
mentally retarded. There is something decidedly pathetic and unfunny 
about a joke aimed at a dying woman's hospital suite- just one of the 
many cracks made in the 95 minute production. And the scenes that are 
genuinely funny, which, thanks primarily to Nathan Lane, there are a few 
of, are too embarrassing to enjoy in the middle of a poorly disguised 
drama.
Poor Nathan Lane. This is a great role for him and nobody will remember 
it in two weeks. He is absolutely fabulous as a constantly schmoozing 
New York Jew. And David Hyde Pierce is commendable as well, playing his 
typical straight man role. Even John Cleese is fun in a supporting role. 
As for Bette Midler, you would never be able to tell that she is the 
great performer she is by watching this movie. 
The opening lyric of Isn't She Great is "I don't know where I am going." 
Neither does the film.

Review for Dogma (1999)
USA Release Dates: Dogma: Out & Sleepy Hollow: November 19, 1999
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/sleepy_hollow_and_dogma_-_reviews.htm
Sleepy Hollow and Dogma are two very different films dealing with death. 
Dogma is most effective because of its hilariously dark comedy and 
ensemble cast. Sleepy Hollow finds its success in a classic horror 
story, grizzly images and two remarkable performances. Both stand out as 
solid works with minimal faults and can consequently expect mid-range 
box office.
Dogma's Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are angels famous 
for Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and several other acts of skilled 
labor. However, they have been ejected from heaven because of their sins 
on earth (not mass-murder, but quibbling with the Lord, consuming liquor 
and assorted others). They discover a loophole that may allow them back 
"home" when Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) decides to rededicate a New 
Jersey church as part of a newer, hipper Christianity called Catholicism 
Wow! (no mention of olestra is made). They fail to realize that their 
returning to heaven could trigger a small side affect: the end of all 
existence.
Sleepy Hollow's Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken in a deliciously 
chilling yet relatively small performance) is rejected from his grave 
because his head was severed from his body with his own sword and stolen 
shortly thereafter. He decapitates his victims and takes their heads to 
use in place of his own.
Dogma was condemned by The Church early on and consequently changed 
studios a few times before finally settling in at Lion's Gate. 
Director Kevin Smith makes light of this in his opening disclaimer which 
describes itself as "a statement made to save one's own ass" and 
includes a few below-the-belt shots at Disney, the original studio. 
Those without a sense of humor may have trouble dealing with a 
mass-shooting of company executives who make golden calves, a muse who 
strips for money because of writer's block and a pop singer, Alanis 
Morisette, playing the Big Guy (Gal?) in the sky.
Sleepy Hollow is a time revered horror story that has only been slightly 
modified for the film. Much of the light-fright is dependant on a 1799 
setting which provides candle-lit rooms, no automobiles and strong 
gothic elements.
The killing sprees in both films are highlighted by grizzly images and 
excessive amounts of blood. Whether a mass-slaughter at church or 
head-spitting tree is more disturbing, I leave up to you.
Washington Irving's classic tale, directed by horror master Tim 
Burton, is complemented by two key performances from Johnny Depp and 
Christina Ricci as Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tassel respectively. 
For Depp this is another dark role in the tradition of his title 
character in Edward Scissorhands and role in Nightmare on Elm Street. 
For Ricci this is an amalgamation of her career to date and testament to 
that fact that she is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. 
The similarities to her classic portrayal of Wednesday Adams are 
obvious, but a closer look reveals that her character's love affair 
with Crane soon after her boyfriend's death show similarities to her 
role as Dee-Dee in The Opposite of Sex. The darker and more frightful 
elements can be compared to her part in the star-studded independent 
film Hurlyburly.
Dogma's cast is as endowed as Ricci's Hurlyburly. Affleck and Damon 
team up for the first time since their award winning Good Will Hunting. 
Other than the persistent use of the "F-word," the two films have little 
in common, showing how versatile the couple can be. George Carlin, a 
dignified legend in the world of stand-up comedy, gives a performance as 
funny as Walken's is frightful and equally sized (leading you to 
wonder how he got billing over Matt Damon, the film's co-star). Linda 
Florentino (of Men in Black fame) plays Bethany, the film's heroine 
who is sent to stop the rejected angels from entering the New Jersey 
church. She is a pleasure to watch and seems to be establishing herself 
as a solid actress. Other delights include Chris Rock reprising his 
traditional "'cause I'm black!" role, Selma Hayek as a much better 
muse than Sharon Stone, and the film's director, Kevin Smith, as 
Silent Bob the unknowing prophet.
Both films have faults, albeit minor ones. Dogma's audience is too 
busy laughing to put aside time for some meaningful and serious scenes 
towards the end. Sleepy Hollow has trouble developing its characters 
early and consequently you aren't sure of some victims' identity. 
But these are small flaws and in today's Hollywood both Dogma and 
Sleepy Hollow stand out as being well above average.

Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Hilarious, entertaining, sexy and perhaps even shagadellic, Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the type of 
fall-out-of-your-seat-laughing comedy that only comes around on the 
rarest of occasions. With acting so uproariously funny, and a script 
that delivers punch line after punch line at a pace so rapid that you 
miss most of the movie while trying to stop laughing, Austin Powers is 
the comic convention of 1999.
A sequel in the truest of ways, the latest adventures of Austin Powers 
follow those of his in the 1997 hit, Austin Powers: International Man of 
Mystery. Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in one of three boisterously entertaining 
performances in this film) is back on earth in 1999 despite his previous 
venture into space at the conclusion of the 1997 movie, and more evil 
than ever. He plans on taking over the earth and ridding it of his 
enemy, Austin Powers (Mike Myers). In order to do this he must travel 
from his new space headquarters, a Starbucks shop, in 1999 back to 1969 
and steal Austin Powers' mojo. Considering this seems to be a movie 
spoofing Star Wars heavily, it is assumed that this mojo is the 
equivalent of the "the force" and can be easily withdrawn from a frozen 
body. Understanding that leads to the obvious point that a total and 
utter suspension of reality is essential.
Dr. Evil has yet another problem to deal with, as his son, Scott Evil 
(Seth Green), is upset with him for doing what he does. This leads to a 
wonderful spoof on the times, as the two meet again on the Jerry 
Springer Show. Just infuriating Scott further, Dr. Evil has been cloned 
as well. The result is what he refers to as Mini-me, an exact replica, 
but only 1/8 his size. To Dr. Evil the clone is like the son he always 
wanted and never had. After all, as the first movie showed, there is 
nothing like a good father son conflict to bring laughs to the screen. 
This is an absolute truth as the characters continuously try to out-hip 
each other, while Dr. Evil complains that Scott is only "The Diet Coke 
of Evil."
When you have  a spy as sexy as Austin Powers himself, the women 
naturally follow. In this installment, we meet Felicity Shagwell 
(Heather Graham), Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnson of TV's 3rd Rock from 
the Sun), Robin Swallows (Gia Carides) and a few other shagable young 
women. The basic plot outline of their roles is that all of them are 
working for Dr. Evil, save Felicity who is a secret agent.
Additionally, this production is full of cameos from some most notable 
names. Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, 
Willie Nelson, Tim Robbins and Jerry Springer all poke into the film at 
some point, with most of them just delivering one of the countless penis 
jokes as themselves. Mike Myers also takes on a third role, of a more 
cameo like nature.
What really brings the humor to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me 
are the spoofs on every day things that people can relate to, and 
classic movies that have always begged to be lampooned in this fashion. 
Even the trailers for this film suggested that "If you can only see one 
movie this summer, see85Star Wars: Episode One" as the film immediately =
adapts to being released in the wake of the sure hit from Lucas. So the 
solution chosen was to tease the force to nth degree, even beginning 
this film with yellow text scrolling up the screen, with an outer-space 
background. Additionally, there are the obvious connections to James 
Bond which would be the central focus of the film if it was a plot 
concentrated work instead of a witty collection of humor. And just to 
top it off there is a moment just slightly modified from John Watters' 
cult classic, Pink Flamingos, involving the consumption of human waist.
Mike Myers may well be doing these movies because his talent is limited 
elsewhere. Despite moderate success as Wayne in Wayne's World, and an 
award worthy performance in 54, the actor has been wise enough to limit 
his work after the 1993 flop, So I Married An Axe Murderer. Regardless, 
he is perfect for these roles probably due in large part to his writing 
credit on the film as well. Heather Graham is the ideal counterpart to 
Myers, bringing the presence of an actress capable of delivering the 
jokes and body humor just as well as anyone else, with a sexual appeal 
that makes her the Bond Girl of Austin Powers. This is never better 
shown than a scene which pits her in bed with an obese character simply 
known as Fat Bastard (Myers' third role). The two of them light up the 
screen and make an otherwise totally disgusting, uncalled-for scene into 
a funny and just mildly nauseating one that sticks with you for a long 
time.
Mike Myers has created a comic gem. Spoofing everything in sight, 
holding nothing back, and running monologues of nothing but penis humor, 
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the year's most refreshing 
comedy. Further enlightened by great character acting and distinguished 
cameos, the film will make you hope for and anticipate a future 
installment. Needless to say, this certainly isn't the Diet Coke of 
movies.

Title
Review for Edtv (1999)
See other reviews by Mac VerStandig at http://www.moviereviews.org
As the 21st century rapidly approaches, much is being made about the 
public's obsession with material that is, to put it frankly, none of 
it's business. The stories that attract America's attention for the 
longest periods of time have not been the cold war's termination, 
fleeing refugees from 3rd world countries or even the state of the 
union. Albeit that those are all issues that get a fair amount 
attention, the larger coverage is given to stories like the assault of a 
fellow skater that was linked to Tonya Harding, the trial of O. J. 
Simpson, and the relationship between a certain world leader and a young 
intern. It can be argued that this is due to people's need for 
knowledge that they are not the only ones with imperfections, and there 
are others with even greater dilemmas. But whatever the cause, there 
seems to be little more that the public enjoys, as the latest Ron Howard 
film, Edtv demonstrates, than being able to turn on the television or 
pick up a newspaper and see, hear or read about someone else's 
problems.
Ed Pekurny (Mathew McConaughey) is little more than your average guy 
with real world problems. He is about 30 years old, single and has an 
ordinary job at the local video store. His role model is Burt Reynolds, 
and yet the two seem to have little in common. His father left him when 
he was 12, and his mother lives with his step father, Al (Martin 
Landau), who raised him for all intensive purposes. His older brother, 
Ray (Woody Harrelson) is very similar to Ed but features a far more 
attractive life with six month girlfriend, Shari (Jenna Elfman).
On the other side of the ball there is Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres) and Dr. 
Whitaker (Rob Reiner) who are both executives at a documentary based 
television network. They are wealthy and don't face problems similar 
to Ed's, but rather one major issue, that of slumping ratings. As of 
late, their network has been doing so bad that it actually lost out to 
"the Gardening Channel." Cynthia has a plan that will either bring them 
back to the top, or lose it all. The risk is major, but she is confident 
that if you put one person on television and follow every moment of 
their life, people will watch.
Of course, Ed is selected as the one and agrees. This process is most 
predictable and often is actually boring to watch. However, that soon 
ends when the great television experiments begins and "coincidentally" 
things start to become interesting. (A typical Hollywood touch to a film 
of this nature.)
Mathew McConaughey is less than stellar in his lead role. Often upstaged 
by Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman, and even in a cameo by 
Dennis Hopper, his performance is most ironic as it often resembles a 
poorly acted television drama. One scene in particular features him with 
a love interest where his every move seems staged leading up to the soon 
to be stolen kiss. Other scenes are remarkably similar, but they are 
supposed to be staged to some degree, so it is harder to assign blame to 
McConaughey alone for them.
Fortunately, the supporting cast is absolutely brilliant. As the movie 
takes turns towards the melodramatic, and becomes more and more 
predictable, they seem to be the only saving grace in scene after scene. 
Ellen DeGeneres in particular stands out as someone who could have 
easily overplayed her role, but instead chose to turn in a refreshingly 
smart performance. At one point she has what is scripted as a break down 
type scene at a conference table, that could have very easily not only 
ruined her job, but Reiner's as well. However, instead of going for 
the over used Hollywood effect of over the top acting, she keeps it very 
light and actually makes a very good statement in doing so.
Despite the fine ensemble acting minus McConaughey, Edtv has a major 
flaw that reaches far beyond one poor performance. The movie has a very 
black and white message that is an opposition to scandalous 
entertainment, in particular it uses the given example of a man's life 
on television. The problem with that is 90% of the entertainment in this 
film does not come from the scenes focussing around this 24-hours a day 
documentary, but rather from us watching the man on television. So, 
despite sending a heavy message against the monitoring of other lives 
for entertainment, the movie relies on that very concept.
However, the question must be posed if the film itself is at fault for 
this. After all, almost all movies rely on the life and times of one 
person, fictional or real, as their main source of entertainment. But 
when a comparison is drawn to The Truman Show, an earlier release about 
a similar situation, you realize that films like this can be done 
tastefully. And you also realize that most films focussing on an 
individual, do so in a less scandalous and more pure fashion.
A realization must be made though. And that is that the public does seem 
to enjoy this type of "real life" trash. We may not want to admit it, 
and we may know that it is wrong, but we do like seeing other people's 
flaws. And this movie is masterful at doing that. It pokes fun in a way 
that is absolutely hysterical and keeps you interested for the two 
hours.
So, overall Edtv has some positives and negatives. The acting is good; 
but that is countered by one central performance that is horrendous. The 
message is very moralistic and delivered in an enjoyable fashion; but 
that is countered by a contradiction that undermines the entire film. 
Ultimately I did enjoy this film, as I have enjoyed the various scandals 
of the past few years. But I never gave my approval to OJ, or Tonya, or 
Monica, and I don't plan on starting here.

Title
Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/whole_nine_yards,_the.htm ---
Hollywood conservatives beware! The two best films of the new millennium 
aren't great dramatic narratives, heart-tugging romances or even 
intellectual studies. First The Big Tease, a lowbrow mockumentary 
cracking jokes at Scottish and homosexuals. Now The Whole Nine Yards, an 
uproarious date flick full of over-exaggerations.
"Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist, which, according to several 
sources throughout the film, makes him a likely suicide candidate. This 
isn't helped by the fact that his ex-partner, who also was his 
father-in-law, embezzled massive amounts of money before dying. Now Oz 
lives in misery with his wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), his 
mother-in-law (Carmen Ferlan) and a mammoth debt.
Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudesky (Bruce Willis) is a 17-times-veteran contract 
killer fresh out of the slammer thanks to a loose tongued plea-bargain. 
But Jimmy refused witness protection so he has turned to a new life in 
Canada for safety and good gardening soil (tomatoes grow quickly)- next 
door to Oz.
Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) is the son of the crime-boss that Tudesky 
ratted out. He lives in Chicago with several hit-men, Tudesky's 
estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge) and a contract on Tudesky's head.
Everyone from oz's secretary to Gogolak seems to want or need someone 
dead for either revenge, money or necessity. Who are the double agents? 
Who will live? Who will die? And which one turns out to be the cop?
The Whole Nine Yards proves to be a hysterical blend of Airplane and 
Goodfellas. Of all the dark comedies over the past several years, none 
have managed to make murder as funny as it is here. Responsible for this 
phenomenon is undoubtedly the cast. Perry's innocent facial 
expressions, Willis' ability to deliver absurd lines with the utmost 
seriousness and Pollak's beautifully overacted gangster are certainly 
contributing factors. But the real treats are Michael Clarke Duncan 
(recently in The Green Mile) and Amanda Peet (recently in Isn't She 
Great) as a hit-man and secretary, respectively. Duncan, for those of 
you not familiar with him, is a huge African-American man who 
demonstrates his comedic ability with this intentionally cliched 
tough-guy character. Peet is an exceptionally attractive female with a 
knack for delivering nutty punch lines in a fashion even more impressive 
than Willis.
Another key factor in the film's success is its ability to handle 
murder in such a hysterically nonchalant manner. For every bit as 
ultra-disturbing and spine tingling as The Talented Mr. Ripley was, The 
Whole Nine Yards is boisterously entertaining. This goes to show that a 
grade-A comedy ensemble can make extraordinary light of what was equally 
serious when presented in another manner. There are actually more deaths 
in this film than Ripley and The Whole Nine Yards plays at a fraction of 
Ripley's time.
Critics will likely quip that the movie loses points at the end due to 
over-sappiness and a forced romance. I beg to differ. The Whole Nine 
Yards truly achieves its full pomp when it manages to integrate these 
"awe!" scenes with its uproarious comedy. The end result is something 
that Hollywood hasn't seen a quality version of in a long time: a 
Friday night date flick.

Title
Review for Big Daddy (1999)
Adam Sandler's latest film, Big Daddy, is an unreal one that is
candy-coated with humor lifted from Sandler's previous hit, Billy
Madison, while possessing a theme of romance common to his other smash
hit, The Wedding Singer. Further amplifying the overall lack of
reality is technical faultiness, and universally poor acting, save one
supporting role.
Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a 32-year-old law school graduate
throwing his life away. Despite the relative success of his friends
from law school, Sonny is going nowhere in life and seems to
procrastinate everything to the nth degree. Admittedly, he hasn't been
up before 11 AM in "like 10 years" and supposedly filed for social
security at age 30.
The only reliable constants in Sonny's life have been girlfriend
Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) and roommate Kevin (Jon Stuart). When Kevin
prepares to move to the Far East, and Vanessa informs Sonny that their
relationship is on the rocks, Sonny becomes desperate for something to
bring stability back to his pathetic life. So when the opportunity
literally knocks at his door, he becomes a temporary parent to
five-year-old Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), as part of a grander
scheme to win Vanessa over.
This film is a collaboration of the romance from The Wedding Singer
and the humor from Billy Madison, both financial hits for
Sandler. When Sonny realizes that Vanessa is out of the picture for
good, and starts chasing Layla (Joey Lauren Adams), the supposedly
perfect girl, the parallels to The Wedding Singer cannot be
ignored. Ever more apparent are the similarities to Billy
Madison. Both are films focusing on an adult who hasn't fully reached
his potential in life, played by Adam Sandler. Also, both feature
several scenes in a school. But most obvious are the countless
big-boy-urinating-with-little-kid-in-awkward-place jokes that are
common to both productions. Coincidentally, both films also feature a
cameo from longtime Sandler friend, Steve Buscemi.
Extremely poor acting, for the most part, further degrades Big Daddy's
believability. Adam Sandler was near perfect in his previous comic
productions, and should be credited fully for their success. He was
also one of the undisputed forces behind his romantic film, The
Wedding Singer, and its success. However, just as Ben and Jerry's
tasty chocolate ice cream stains the company's beautiful shirts upon
contact, Sandler's multiple talents don't homogenize either. The
outcome is a lame Sandler who never fully explodes into his uproarious
vocal humor because he is constantly trying to be a sweetheart in love
at the same time. This is best highlighted in a scene where he learns
of and meets Vanessa's new boyfriend at the same time. Quickly
realizing him to be an older man, Sandler launches into a series of
age based jokes. Yet they simply aren't funny, probably due to the
restraint necessary as a result of Julian being in the room, thus
making Sandler hold back as he attempts to display affection
simultaneously.
Jon Stuart's wonderful talents as a standup comedian simply don't
translate into the ability to act well in this movie. His biggest
fault may well be his habit of overemphasizing each line, as comedians
of his nature do in order to receive laughs on each punch line. This
makes him sound very much like someone deliberately reading off cue
cards, and forgetting to actually act in the process. The finest
example of this is when Stuart's character, Kevin, is in the airport
preparing to board a plane when Sonny notifies him via cell phone that
Julian has appeared out of nowhere. As he steps to the side of the
plane's boarding line and volunteers to come back to assist Kevin, he
sounds more like R2-D2 than a grown man trying to make an important
decision.
Big Daddy's one positive asset is Joey Lauren Adams' acting. Despite a
harsh sounding accent, she delivers a very solid, funny, and romantic
performance as the second love in Sonny's life. She even manages to
stay clear of the negative force that Sandler brings, and truly stand
out on her own. This is best exhibited in a scene pitting both of them
in a public laundry facility.  Sandler chokes on the aforementioned
deadly combination of comedy and romance, while she sticks strictly to
the latter trait and actually makes the scene worthwhile in doing so.
Chief Lighting Technician Petr Hlinomaz's inconsistency from scene to
scene further harms any feeble remains of believability that Big Daddy
may still have. Several of the film's scenes revolve around putting
Julian to bed, and occur in his bedroom. The first scene of this
nature depicts a pitch dark room that even requires a nightlight for
the young child. Not only does the nightlight disappear in the
following scenes, but the room seems to get lighter and lighter as
these scenes progress.
Numerous little things continue to subtract from the reality that the
film attempts to posses during its 95 minute life span. These include,
but surely aren't limited to, scenes where Sonny throws himself in
front of a moving car and fails to display so much as a bruise;
Sonny's ability to find a full scuba diving outfit and change into it
in a matter of seconds; and the ability for a grown man and little boy
to urinate on the side of a building whenever they feel the urge, and
never encounter any reprecussions.
As Big Daddy opens, the screen is black. Then, over the next hour and
a half, unrealistic, hard to believe, poorly acted, and technically
deficient scenes run across the screen. One performance carries with
it a ray of light, but the movie is otherwise a waste of time, a waste
of money, and a waste of 35mm film. Perhaps things would have been
better had the screen stayed black.

Title
Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
Director George Lucas' fourth undertaking of the Star Wars legacy is his
strongest. Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace has qualities that
make it a fine film. The special effects are some of the most dazzling and
amazing ever seen on the big screen. In addition, the acting is excellent.
However, that is met by an exceptionally weak plot that makes the 130 minute
film, about a half-hour too long.
The latest Star Wars installment takes place in the realm of space at a time
unknown. The evil Trade Federation is plotting to take over the planet
Naboo. The key to this task is having Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of the
Naboo people sign a treaty. Having intelligence and courage far beyond her
young years, the Queen refuses in the interest of her people.
In an attempt to negotiate a trade agreement, Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam
Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) come to the Trade
Federation, acting as peacekeepers of sorts. The Trade Federation is opposed
to the Jedi, and therefor tries to kill these two ambassadors at once. If
this situation seems a little sketchy or lacking explanation and detail,
that is probably because the movie has none, something that is inexcusable
for a film calling itself "Episode One."
As the plot, or lack thereof limps along for the next two hours, you meet
several new characters. This long list includes some robots called R2-D2 and
C3-P0, creatures named Jar Jar Binks and Yoda, and a little boy named Anakin
Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is thought to be the so called "chosen one" of
the Jedi Force.
The other blunder in relation to the story is its complexity. This is a film
aimed at all audiences, proudly wearing a PG rating. But some of the
political aspects are far too elaborate for young audiences. A key point of
the film's later stage focuses around an intergalactic senate. As is, that
is a concept needing explanation for children. But almost all youngsters are
bound to be lost when the primary focus of a scene shifts to a no confidence
vote, again with no definition offered for those who are not already
familiar with this form of political assassination. In this aspect, the film
fails to truly reach a versatile audience of all ages.
Some 22 years ago, a little film called Star Wars revolutionized special
effects. The director had created something once thought to be an oxymoron:
low budget eye candy. Today Lucas has once again produced a film that is
delightful to watch. The light saber fights that the series is famous for,
are astonishing to see once again. For instance, take a climatic scene where
Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi find themselves fighting an evil creature
named Darth Maul (Ray Park). This is a moment that would ordinarily be
ruined by the gross predictability of the scene, but the dazzling
choreography and vivacious site of laser beams striking each other, hold the
audience over and actually makes watching the moment a voluptuous surprise.
Despite early bickering to the media about the experience of making an
effects driven science fiction film, Liam Neeson gives an immense
performance. Ewan McGregor does so as well. They bring quality to a script
plagued by obscenely distressed dialogue. Almost always on screen as a duo,
the two clearly have chemistry together. The finest example of this occurs
in the beginning of the film when the two are acting as ambassadors in the
Trade Federation, and come into their first battle scene alone together. The
surprise displayed by the two as they realize an attack upon them is
imminent, in combination with their performance fighting the creatures, is
simply magnificent.
Despite the positive screen presence of the film's key actors, and enjoyable
effects, Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace is about a half-hour
too long. It is slow to start in the beginning and there are fewer action
sequences in this installment than previous versions. It would come as
little surprise if the die-hard fans who stood in line for days to get
opening night tickets, caught up on some much needed sleep during the film's
slower parts.
Some movies are just different. They are not like the other films that come
out each year. They are unique. That is not necessarily to say that these
productions are the best works of cinema. Star Wars: Episode One - The
Phantom Menace is certainly one of these movies. It does not matter how good
or bad the various elements of this production are, because most people
aren't going to see it for the normal reasons. When you consider the
aforementioned fans that camped out for tickets, the 22 year legacy of the
series, and just the overall zest that Lucas gives each of these works, you
come to a simple conclusion: Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace is
not so much a film as an event, and because of that, everyone should see
this movie.

Title
Review for Faro, El (1998)
"Extraordinary people never die." A character murmurs this line in the
latest film from Argentinean director Eduardo Mignogna, "El Faro" (The
Lighthouse). These four words seem to capture the entire essence of this 108
minute masterpiece.
As the production opens, images of a photo album appear on the screen.
Memories. The family being pictured is happy. Then, less than ten seconds
later, the family is no longer. The parents are deceased, the two daughters
orphaned, and one crippled as a result of the car crash that will forever
change their lives. That is where the heartwarming story of these two
sisters commences.
The eldest sister's name is Carmela, but she goes by Meme. She is in the
position of having to take care of her younger sister, Anita, as Meme is
over 18 and legally responsible. Meme's only objective in life is to have
her own baby. That has made her a very sexual and edgy young woman. Anita is
a young girl who seems to live not thinking of tomorrow, but concentrating
only on today.
Where Meme has a direction in life, Anita has none. Meme is sinful, with
addictions to cigarettes, alcohol, and sex. Anita is young, pure, and
innocent. However different, they both are still orphans surviving on a day
to day basis, needing each other more than anything else in the world.
A classic plot would only damage, if not ruin, this fine film. The
Lighthouse is a movie that chronicles two young girls trying to make the
best out of a shattered life, and grow up while doing so. The interesting
element is that they slowly seem to grow closer and switch positions. The
film begins with Anita as young and immature and progresses until she is a
woman. Meme starts off responsible and almost perfect. However, her
drinking, smoking, unprotected sex and lack of care for a crippled leg,
slowly turn her into the one needing care.
To Eduardo Mignogna's credit, he didn't attempt any complexity in his choice
of filmmaking style. One of the simple, yet extremely effective things he
did do was to use black out and white out editing effects from time to time.
By allowing certain scenes to depart or arrive by fading, it gives the
audience that little bit of extra time they need to absorb the incredible
scenes they have just witnessed.
As much as the simplicity may be part of The Lighthouse's beauty, you also
must wonder what it really cost the film. It seems that the independent
budget may have denied the film some of the help it could have used. The
lighting is often poor, thus leaving otherwise beautiful scenes dimly lit.
The makeup seems to be sub standard as well. The one moment where Meme's
scar is shown is brief, probably due to the extremely fake look that it
carries. Inexcusably, the shot selection also left something to be desired.
Very rarely do we ever get to see the girls' faces, and the only lengthy
shot of either of them occurs when Meme has removed her shirt. But these are
all forgivable flaws, especially when you weigh their magnitude against the
magnificence of this film.
One of the most difficult tests that a film faces is the comparison between
it and another previous work that was successful. Ironically, the best movie
for "The Lighthouse" to be examined against was very much an opposite. The
1992 hit, "A League of Their Own" was unlike Mignogna's work, in that it was
a big budget Hollywood film with big name stars and an accomplished
director, Penny Marshall. However, by closely examining the common plot of
two sisters trying to look out for each other, and growing in the process,
you will find that the two films yield that one major similarity. In that
aspect, The Lighthouse is a far superior film. The character development is
far richer, and the emotional attachment of the audience is far greater. It
also claims the wonderful advantage of not having the typically predictable
Hollywood ending. This production seems to have passed that test with plenty
of room to spare.
The Lighthouse is one of the most touching, heartwarming, and enjoyable
films to emerge in years. It doesn't use any fancy effects, and it doesn't
feature any big names. It is not even in English. Instead it uses a simple
message and touches all that see it through that message: "Extraordinary
people never die."

Review for Hurlyburly (1998)
Hurlyburly is an incredibly and frighteningly dark film. Although it is 
filled with a very cynical and sarcastic humor as well, the movie itself 
is shocking, disturbingly blunt and often hard to watch. And yet, awful 
as it may sound; that is the beauty behind this film and the aspect of 
this films that makes it the most dramatically surprising independent 
film since Larry Clark showed us Kids in 1995. Fortunately for 
Hurlyburly there is more hope for success and recognition, due to a 
grade A cast, than the truly underground Kids could have ever dreamed 
of.
Hurlyburly is such an outrageously tense film that it could very easily 
make par without a plot. And it does for the most part. There is neither 
a central goal that the characters in this film pursue nor a subject 
matter that occupies the majority of the movie. What there is instead is 
a tense character study of 4 men, an exotic dancer, a runaway girl and a 
non-central female figure who exists as more of a presence that affects 
the other 6 people than a character herself.
Eddie (Academy Award Nominee Sean Penn), Mickey (Academy Award Winner 
Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Academy Award Nominee Chazz Palminteri) are 
roommates in the town of Hurlyburly, outside of LA. They all share a 
common degree of sexual disparity as well as what appears to be some 
very expensive drug habits. Cocaine is breakfast, nights are undefined 
and work is just a brief phase in their day to day lives. Whether this 
is a bond formed by 3 incredibly unusual, yet undoubtedly real people, 
or a force of separation, is for you to judge.
The common "friend" of this trio is Artie (Golden Globe and Emmy Nominee 
Garry Shandling). However his presence is so common among the 3, that 
his character develops and exists as a 4th male figure only separated by 
the absence of sexual urge. He introduces Donna (Academy Award Winner 
Anna Paquin) to the group of 3. She is a runaway who claims to have 
hitchhiked her way to LA and then established residence in an elevator. 
She is eventually picked up by Artie and is given to the trio as a "care 
package" to engage in sexual behavior with when and how they wish. Odd a 
thing as that may sound, it seems like just another every day occurrence 
when put in this incredibly complex and equally warped film.
Then there is Bonnie (Golden Globe Nominee Meg Ryan) who is a friend of 
the group. She is one of the most intriguing parts of this film because 
she is the only adult female that a complex examination is performed on. 
This film puts her under a microscope of types and examines her every 
move, revealing an odd and sad life that is totally missed when just 
looked upon from the surface. Her interactions with the group of male 
characters are incredibly complicated and must be closely examined for 
the rich symbolism to appear.
When put together, these characters create a dramatically diverse and 
frightening film. Without the great acting by every member of this 
7-person cast, the movie would be a failure. But the award-winning 
actors get it done, and they do so in style. Everyone involved with this 
film deserves yet another award to his or her name for their 
performance, and no one is more so deserving than Sean Penn. In the lead 
role he is absolutely amazing.
When combined, all these elements make what is one of the best films of 
the year, and perhaps the finest ensemble acting since the 1983 hit, The 
Big Chill. And yet it is such a deeper and more shocking film. Everyone 
who sees Hurlyburly will be stunned. When leaving this film there is an 
effect that is almost indescribable, but it is a force that the material 
you just saw lays upon you, and it grasps you and forces it's way into 
you. Perhaps it will stay the forever, I certainly hope so, as I 
wouldn't want to part with this film anytime soon.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
Jon Turteltaub's Instinct is the ultimate deja vu for anyone who 
has been awake over the past several years. Completely and utterly 
unoriginal, the movie is a collection of other Hollywood hits, Jane 
Goodall's well known ventures into the wild, an exceptionally strong 
musical score, some of the worst cinematography of the year, and a 
performance so award worthy, that it already received one 8 years ago! 
These elements result not so much in a picture, but rather a collage. 
Messily assembled, with glue sticking out on the edges, and some great 
old photos that got a little too cut up, the "artwork" really isn't 
much to behold.
Dr. Ethan Powell (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is an extremely respected 
psychiatrist. He works for a prestigious medical center and boasts of a 
family life with no apparent problems. Much of his research is done in 
Africa, having taken over 20 trips in a decade alone. His last trip to 
the continent found him missing in action (MIA), when he failed to 
return from field research one day. What followed was his spending 
nearly two years in the jungle, living among the gorillas. In short, the 
film takes what Jane Goodall accomplished when she observed these 
animals, and pushes it one step further, having the protagonist live 
among them, not as a human living a human's life, but as a human 
living the lifestyle of a gorilla. By the time Powell is brought back to 
the USA, two African police are dead with three more hospitalized, and 
he has spent a year in an African prison, all as a result of his newly 
found primitive inner self. What emerges when the plane lands in America 
is a cross between Hannibal Lector (Played by Hopkins in The Silence of 
the Lambs) and John Patrick Mason (Played by Sean Connery in The Rock), 
a killer so well educated that he can use every day objects to wreak 
havoc, but possessing an unparalleled degree of wisdom at the same time. 
Following in the early footsteps of Powell is Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba 
Gooding Jr.). A young, energetic, and driven psychiatrist, whose 
potential is endless. His mentor is Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland) 
who is extremely encouraging and helpful to the young doctor. So when 
the opportunity to treat Powell comes up, Caulder immediately sees not 
only the chance to further his career, but also to write a best selling 
book as well. With the help of Hillard, the assignment is soon his.
Many surprises await Dr. Caulder as he begins his treatment of the 
killer. Not only does Powell not talk, but his vicious, primal behavior 
has led to an estranged family as well. Caulder sees a source of 
information in Powell's daughter Lyn (Maura Tierney), who in turn 
wants to be reconnected with her father, a man she still deeply loves.
Many similarities exist between Instinct and other Hollywood films. Some 
are major, and some minor. But none approaches the level of near 
plagiarism found in regards to The Silence of the Lambs. Not only does 
Hopkins' presence and similar performance draw a parallel, but the 
other lead roles do as well; One of the most notable similarities being 
the role of Clarice Starling (Jodie Fostor) in the 1991 film, versus 
that of Dr. Caulder in this production. Both are energetic young people 
handling the "case" of their careers. Neither of them has an objective 
consistent with that of the genius they are studying. The question of 
how much of this work was really suggested by Daniel Quinn's novel 
Ishmael, and how much Screenwriter Gerald DiPego may have borrowed from 
his video rack, must be asked.
Both Hopkins and Gooding have Academy Awards to their name. Neither 
of them fails to meet the expectations that they are held to in this 
film. Gooding's performance is his finest since Jerry Maguire. This is 
best demonstrated in a scene where he enters a gymnasium full of 
mentally ill inmates and attempts to defy the prison staff. His cool, 
calm, and positive emotions are dazzlingly displayed in his fine 
performance, and make this scene, as well as many others, flow smoothly. 
Sir Anthony Hopkins is absolutely marvelous in his role. Despite the 
obvious resemblance to his earlier work, the character acting in his 
part is still breathtaking. His finest moment, and perhaps the most 
memorable of the film, comes when he is describing his adventures among 
apes, "They accepted a man - they took me in as family - that's the 
miracle." he explains. As these nearly melodramatic words come out of 
his mouth, he transforms them into tense, horrifying comments that send 
chills down your spine.
Danny Elfman delivers a score to accompany this film that is absolutely 
majestic. Often the music serves to compliment the dramatic and 
thrilling elements of the film, provided by the two lead actors. The 
score brings out a whole array of emotions, and often makes the scene 
complete. However, it also accompanies the weak cinematography. For a 
film largely based in Africa, certain visual expectations are naturally 
established. Unfortunately they are never met. The color is dull and 
boring, the landscape limited. An ineffective series of shots from the 
African jungle begin the film, one of the unfortunate examples of the 
lacking cinematography. It is not by any means a stretch to say that an 
average tourist could better capture these images, than Director of 
Photography Philippe Rousselot and Art Director Chris Cornwell do here.
This movie is not original by any means, and is often soar to the eye. 
Certainly, the acting is phenomenal and the score is awesome. But unless 
you have a desire to see Hopkins' interpretation of a murdering 
genius, then this isn't worth the money, not even on video. And if you 
do want to see it, The Silence of the Lambs is already at a store near 
you.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
Being John Malkovich is an original film of genius. Many may have 
problems comprehending the movie's complex, multi-layered plot and its 
box office will consequently look to be no better than mid-range. 
However, a video shelf life prolonged by second viewings should make 
this film a cult- if not a mainstream- classic.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a 30-something year old puppeteer who 
seems to be wasting his life away, waiting to someday find a job in the 
marionette business. Craig's wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), is a 
pet-freak who goes so far as to take her chimpanzee to a psychiatrist. 
They live in an apartment in the only city that could possible tolerate, 
not to mention accept, them: The Big Apple.
Craig finally comes across a job where he can use his hands and fingers, 
a filing assistant, and is quickly hired. His office space may be the 
only thing more bazaar than his animal-infested apartment; it is on the 
7 BD floor (which requires a crow bar and the emergency alarm on an =
elevator to access and has ceilings that appear to be about four feet 
high), the secretary has a hearing impediment similar to one of Gilda 
Radner's old Saturday Night Live characters and his boss is a 
105-year-old man who openly shares of his necessity to urinate in a 
sitting position and desires to have sex with the aforementioned 
secretary. Yet the oddest feature of his new office is a tiny door 
behind a filling cabinet. The door is a portal into John Malkovich's 
head. When you enter this portal you are sucked into Malkovich, seeing 
through his eyes and partially controlling him. Then, after 15 minutes, 
you are spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Once Craig discovers this 
hidden door, the possibilities become infinite.
Andy Warhol once suggested that everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. 
In this movie, everyone has at least 15 minutes of Malkovich. This seems 
to hit on one of society's more voyeuristic obsessions: knowing 
others' every movie. For Craig being Malkovich is an opportunity to be 
a sexually attractive man with name recognition. For Lotte it is an 
opportunity to have sex with other women. (She is so inspired the she 
even decides at one point to "85talk to Dr. Feldman about sexual =
re-assignment surgery.") But when Malkovich gets inside of Malkovich it 
is a horrifying experience that is hilarious to watch. (It would be 
ruining one of the film's great moments to say any more.)
John Malkovich is, obviously, key to this film. He deserves credit for 
taking the role as himself despite the film's critical plot device of 
him having name recognition but relatively little role recognition. 
Should this production become the cult classic that it likely will, 
Malkovich may discover that he has accidentally gone from one extreme to 
another. He portrays a dramatic character in his next film, The 
Messenger, and may find that people have difficulty taking him seriously 
since he spoofs himself in this movie. (Well timed Halloween masks of 
his face were included in the press kits, a fine example of the level of 
lampooning in this film.)
Rod Sterling became so well respected because he fully explored the 
Twilight Zone, an interesting place that could have been left only half 
covered. Unfortunately, this movie falls short of doing that. At the 
beginning, after Craig has discovered the portal and used it for the 
first time, he contemplates the great philosophical questions that 
arise. For example, he had a piece of wood in his hand when he entered 
Malkovich. When Craig fell on the New Jersey Turnpike, it was gone. So, 
what happened to the wood? The movie could have been even more engaging 
had it explored these options but the film dodged them altogether, thus 
falling short of its potential. Although this is a real pity, you must 
remember that this flaw only exists because great films like this are 
held to a higher standard.

Review for At First Sight (1999)
At First Sight
Reviewed by Mac VerStandig
Critic@moviereviews.org
4 stars (Out of 4)
After seeing At First Sight I found myself in a very rare scenario. As I 
tried to visualize how this review would go, what angles I would take, 
and whether or not this film deserved a positive or negative review, I 
was at a loss for both word and thoughts. But then, to quote one of my 
favorite films, Good Will Hunting, "Something occurred to me and I fell 
into a deep, peaceful sleep." It occurred to me that any movie capable 
of making me think that hard about it's entire panoply of elements is a 
great film for that reason alone.
The real beauty behind At First Sight is that any idiot can see it, and 
they will probably enjoy it and get something out of the whole 
experience. But when someone who is capable of thinking is to view it, 
they will be intellectually challenged by the incredible amounts of 
symbolism found within this great work. Everything in this film from a 
hockey stick to a school bus to a tree brings so much more significance 
to it than the 3 dimensions in which it exists. Not a scene will escape 
where this movie hasn't transformed an otherwise dull object, activity, 
or element of life into a richly vast rainbow of emotions.
Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer) has been blind since he was 3 years old. 
Living in a small town and working as a masseuse for a resort, he had 
adapted to this handicap and his sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis), had 
dedicated her life to helping him fight it. Absent of both a father and 
mother, the 2 have fought their way through life together. Their lives 
are filled with the routine necessary for a blind man, and that is the 
extent of excitement that they will encounter.
But all will change when Virgil falls in love with a client named Amy 
Benic (Mira Sorvino). As Amy slowly takes over his life, she convinces 
him that he can regain his sight through a complex medical procedure. 
After undergoing this treatment, Virgil indeed can see, but struggles 
with association and adjustment. Despite the help of therapist Phil 
Webster (Nathan Lane), things seem even blurrier than before. And so it 
is that the lack of a sense that he once claimed to be a handicap holds 
a presence that disables him even more.
On the surface this appears to be study of human sight, love, romance, 
and a life regained; but below the surface it is so much more. The lack 
of and regaining of sight are merely a vehicle for this film to explore 
some of the innermost complex human emotions. And it does that in a 
manner equivalently miraculous to the vehicle it uses.
Val Kilmer's performance is the best yet of this new year. He takes on a 
very demanding role and meets every expectation that could be imagined, 
then takes it one step farther. Nathan Lane also gives a wonderful 
performance in his small, but far from limited role. He actually manages 
to create a memorable and unforgettably emotional scene in a strip bar. 
However, as all things must have a down side, this film's weak link is 
Mira Sorvino. She is incredibly dull and unconvincing. She closer 
resembled to her father, Paul Sorvino, in Goodfellas than a young girl 
in love. And with that can only bring questions of whether or not she is 
capable of acting, or could Mighty Aphrodite have been a shear fluke.
At First Sight is not so much a film but rather a dazzlingly complex 
portrayal of symbolism. Although damaged by a sub-standard acting 
performance, At First Sight will still has an incredible effect on 
everyone that will see it. And it is for that reason that it is such a 
wonderful film.

Review for Random Hearts (1999)
The tagline on Random Hearts reads "In a perfect world, they never would 
have met." In a perfect world, I never would have seen this movie. The 
biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film, Kay Chandler (Kristin 
Scott Thomas) and Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) are the only two 
major characters alive; resulting in little doubt that they will end up 
together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some 
production.
Dutch is a sergeant in Internal Affairs at the District of Columbia 
police department. Kay is a congresswoman from New Hampshire. Although 
they both think they are happily married, their spouses are cheating 
with each other behind their backs. Dutch and Kay are soon widowed when 
a plane goes down carrying their partners; they subsequently discover 
the affair. The rest of the film is the pointless, unrealistic and 
often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship 
that they were blind to, and getting to know each other in the process.
Two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film. Dutch 
is trying to arrest a fellow officer, a task that seems rather ordinary 
for Hollywood fare. All the great stereotypes get pulled, including my 
personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered 
soon thereafter. Kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her 
campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter 
from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal. These sub plots 
could have made for semi-interesting points, but the film seems afraid 
to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth, and 
consequently suffers.
Random Hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells. Although 
both Kay and Dutch are given their own sub plots, they seem to never 
deal with anyone other than themselves or each other. There is plenty of 
opportunity, Dutch having a partner and Kay having close friends and her 
daughter, but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships. 
Veteran actor and director of this film Sydney Pollack, and critically 
acclaimed up-and-comer Dylan Baker both have cameo roles, but be careful 
not to blink too much or you will miss them both.
Other than its weak plot, it is hard to criticize Random Hearts. 
However, it is also hard to compliment it. Had the film taken some small 
risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have 
tasted more like a well frosted cake, rather than the dry one that 
equates to be.

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
---A copy of this review will be posted to 
http://www.moviereviews.org/wonder_boys.htm on the evening of February 
24, 2000.---
Watching Wonder Boys is somewhat akin to viewing the last two-minutes of 
a football game where your home team simply cannot muster the needed 
points to emerge victorious. The players, Michael Douglas, Tobey 
Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr. and Katie Holmes, all 
maintain hometown-hero status with solid efforts. Unfortunately though, 
the game has run so long that your attention fades in and out and those 
last few passes reek of disparity as the quarterback tries to force 
something that simply doesn't work.
Grady Tripp (Academy Award Winner Michael Douglas) is a college 
English professor who finds his life in shambles as his wife leaves him, 
he struggles with a 2611-page unfinished novel and carries on an affair 
with the chancellor (Academy Award Winner Francis McDormand). His 
solution: dope.
James Leer (Tobey Maguire) is one of Tripp's students. His writing is 
ridiculed by the class, his personal life is dark and mysterious but his 
potential proves to be unlimited with a new book he has written. His 
solution: carrying a gun.
Terry Crabtree (former inmate Robert Downey Jr.) is a down-and-out 
homosexual editor seeking success and a new sexual partner. His 
solution: Tripp's book and Leer's body.
So, to recap, we have a lot of dope, a murder weapon, an unfinished 
novel, a finished novel, an affair and a group of characters with 
problems. Throw in a hood-jumper (Richard Knox), a wise student (Katie 
Holmes), Marilyn Monroe's wedding coat, a dead dog, a Howard Johnson 
parking lot and a forgotten backpack and there's plenty happening in 
the confusion-dominated football game.
Despite being given the opportunity to express a panoply of emotions in 
his self-discovering character, Michael Douglas always makes the 
conservative call and consequently fails to rouse up the crowd even if 
he is getting the job done adequately. Francis McDormand and Tobey 
Maguire both seem to go the extra yard, however. McDormand has an 
ordinary quality that is rare among actresses today- probably the reason 
for her Fargo Oscar- and she reaffirms acting competence here. Maguire 
confirms that he is to the depressive seeking enlightenment what Jack 
Palance is to the old western cowboy. With Pleasantville and The Cider 
House Rules as previous evidence of this trait, the 25 year-old actor is 
Hollywood's newest typecast thanks to this role that is practically 
made for him.
Wonder Boys first hits trouble with the Tripp/chancellor relationship. 
In a film with an otherwise interesting set of plot circumstances, the 
old boy-likes-girl-who-questions-affection-for-boy-untill-boy-
accidentally-does-something-indirectly-affecting-her-and-is-afraid-to-
tell-but-ultimately-she-confrontes-him-with-forgiveness is a tad too
textbook for the film. Ditto the other major development in their
relationship, or, to speak more properly, in her womb.
The movie's plot loses steam well before the fourth quarter even 
begins and things aren't helped by a desperately forced ending that is 
even more textbook than the aforementioned relationship.
This year, hundreds of millions of people looked on as the Super Bowl 
came down to 36 inches. Hopefully not even a fraction of those people 
will subject themselves to this production that sets itself up for a 
hopeless fourth and long and doesn't have 30-second Budweiser spots to 
tide the audience over.

Title
Review for Patch Adams (1998)
Kid yourself not, Patch Adams is an awful comedy. The jokes are rare, 
and often are overpowered by the circumstances surrounding them. 
Fortunately, though, despite Universal's advertising campaign, Patch 
Adams is far from a comedy, and most certainly a drama. And one of the 
best films of the year at that. Through a combination of a strong story, 
brilliant acting, and overall power, Patch Adams is one of the best all 
around films of the decade.
Hunter "Patch" Adams is a suicidal mental patient in the beginning of 
the film. Early scenes show him as what appears to be the one sane 
person in a crowd of insanity. Much resembling the 1975 film, One Flew 
Over The Cuckoo's Nest, this part of the film is remarkably powerful and 
stunningly effective. But the similarities between the two films are few 
enough that Nicholson's role seems to be missing, and just the scenario 
seems familiar.
Soon Patch leaves this institution, and begins a new life with a new 
goal. His objective is to become a doctor and help people. So it is that 
we now move to medical school, were the rest of the film is to take 
place. Patch is a new student who is clearly older than the rest of the 
crowd. He has a "prick" for a roommate, and is immediately thrown into 
classes that offers principles he disagrees with. He becomes a rebel 
constantly fighting for humanity, and is perceived to be far from a hero 
in doing so.
The rest of the film tracks these adventures of the medical student that 
dares. Patch encounters everyone from a love interest to a pancreatic 
cancer patient to a friend that seems to be little more than the 
stereotypical medical student. The story is clearly the force behind 
this incredible film. Based on the autobiographic book, Gesundheit! : 
Bringing Good Health to You, the Medical System, and Society Through 
Physician Service, Complementary Therapies, Humor, and Joy by Hunter 
Doherty Adams, the films goes on to explore many darker and harsher 
realities. This is far from a hero-always-does-well type story, and no 
part of this incredible film seems to be too much like Hollywood, always 
maintaining a real world aspect to it.
Robin William is OscarAE worthy as Patch Adams. He gives what is most =
certainly the best performance of the year by anyone. Despite much 
resemblance to his previous film, Awakenings, he has created a new and 
original character here. He also seems to have proven once again that 
his talent reaches so far from comedy alone, that he truly can do 
anything. But the talent doesn't stop there. Hollywood newcomer Philip 
Seymour Hoffman (Bullworth, Happiness) and Monica Potter also give award 
worthy performances as the roommate and love interest respectively.
Director Tom Shadyac has truly created a film that is an all around 
masterpiece. Parts are visually stunning, others are tragically 
dramatic, and some just a pleasure to watch, but none are anything less 
than extraordinary. Although it is Williams' performance that will be 
remembered, this film goes so far beyond one man's talents, not matter 
how perfect that man.
To not see Patch Adams would be to deny yourself one of the great 
privileges of the film industry. It is an incredible achievement worthy 
of the highest praise possible. So, do yourself a favor and don't miss 
this one, it's worth every penny of the $7.50.

Title
Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
NOTE: Ordinarily, Moviereviews.org will not give away any critical plot 
points of a film that could be interpreted as "spoilers." However, being 
that Music of the Heart is based on a true story and that 
Moviereviews.org feels the film can not be properly credited without 
such revelations, plot giveaways will appear in the following review. If 
this bothers you, please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop 
reading now.
"What does it take to play Carnegie Hall? Practice."
It takes two hours for Music of the Heart to "play Carnegie Hall," both 
figuratively and literally. Like the children it portrays, the movie 
starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a 
show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall.
Roberta Guaspari (Academy Award winner Meryl Streep) has two kids, a 
husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the 
Mediterranean. Her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when 
she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an 
East Harlem elementary school. She soon finds her job is on the rocks as 
the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors. That is 
the pattern-like plot of this production. Ultimately, the film chooses a 
zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an 
all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish.
The first hour of Music of the Heart is rather painful. Roberta's 
character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat. Also 
lacking depth is the film's "bad guy," a narrow-minded music teacher 
(Josh Pais) who rejects Roberta out of principle (the movie never 
explains exactly which principle that is) and conveniently comes and 
goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a 
villain around.
The next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre. They are highlighted by 
one child's return to Roberta's class (coming after the great old 
Hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because 
"My mom said...") and a glowing concert. Not knowing the running time, 
you may expect the credits to role at this point. But they don't. 
Instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad 
to mediocre to excellent.
Director Wes Craven, known for his works of horror, uses some old 
sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing. One romantic break up 
scene is highlighted by the classic "But... last night..." and 
Roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single 
mother regarding their father's absence.
The city of Harlem plays a strong role in the movie. Roberta's mother 
is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and 
the film does nothing to combat that stereotype. The noise tracks for 
these scenes are dominated by sirens; predictably one of Roberta's 
students is gunned down and killed off screen.
One thing the film does lack is subtlety. The fact that a little boy was 
playing "We Shall Overcome" on his violin after the aforementioned 
shooting was a cute and discreet reference. The fact that the entire 
orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone 
reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience. (Of 
course, in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments 
are meant to be overdone, so perhaps he too is just learning to play the 
game.)
Even with all its flaws, Music of the Heart is a beautiful film. That is 
not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning. But as I watched the 
scenes in Carnegie Hall, I thought of some of the great acts that have 
taken that stage. In December of 1979 a comedian named Andy Kaufman put 
on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in 
theatre history. The performance included a dead-on Elvis impression, 
Robin Williams in disguise and a moment at the end when Kaufman 
announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies. So, 
how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life? He had a 
character named Tony Clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of 
irritating and angering the audience. Perhaps it is okay for Music of 
the Heart to start off rusty because just as Kaufman had Santa's 
favorite food, this movie has an amazing finale.

Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
Blast From the Past is the type of totally innocuous film where the 
viewer is neither better nor worse for having watched. The movie is
about a family that locks itself in a fallout shelter in 1962, fearing 
that the Cuban Missile Crisis will lead to nuclear holocaust. 35 years
later, the doors unlock and out comes the son that was born underground. 
His experiences of Los Angeles are equally humorous and telling of the 
times. Don't worry if you miss this one; I doubt anyone other than the 
guy who programs the HBO marathons will remember it in a few years.

Title
Review for Celebrity (1998)
"He's one of those ass-holes who makes all his movies in black and 
white." So is proclaimed about 1/3 the way through Woody Allen's latest 
film, Celebrity, in a movie theatre scene. As in many of his films, this 
is remark that will make audiences erupt laughter. And yet, this punch 
line is not a line at all, but rather a humorous presentation of a 
statement that can be interpreted in so many different ways. In this 
case, you would need to be already watching Celebrity to figure out that 
the entire movie is in black and white and that this is presented in a 
sarcastic fashion. Here you have a classic Woody Allen move of making a 
great "inside joke" at the expense of his film. That is what has made 
Woody Allen a giant, and that is what Celebrity is made up of.
Celebrity's "plot" is little more than a tribute to Andy Warhole's 
famous theory that everyone will enjoy 15 minute of fame at one time or 
another. Although this is only mentioned once in the 2-hour film, it is 
implied throughout. Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) is a reporter for a 
travel magazine, and constantly finds himself surrounded by the stars 
that he hopes to be among someday. It is made clear very early that this 
has lead him to be slightly less than faithful to his wife Robin (Judy 
Davis). So it is that he asks for a divorce after 16 years of marriage.
Lee and Robin are now in the scenario of dating for the first time in 16 
years, and the film explores the people that they come in contact with. 
The common thread is that almost everybody is either seeking or enjoying 
their 15 minutes in the spotlight. Included in this bunch of people, are 
a movie star, a model, a television producer and several "ordinary 
folks".
In what has almost become a trademark of Woody Allen films, Celebrity 
features a cast full of big names. Although none of Allen's "regulars," 
like
Mariel Hemingway, are in this film, and Allen has also chosen to remain 
behind the camera, those who are shown are great. Celebrity features 
hank Azaria, Dylan Baker, Melanie Griffith, and Winona Ryder in 
supporting roles; not to mention Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderfully 
eccentric role. There are also cameos by Isaac Mizrahi, Joey Buttafuaco 
and Donald Trump as himself.
In their lead roles, Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, and Ray Montegna, as 
Robin's boyfriend, are spectacular. Branagh has the task of portraying 
Woody Allen, and seems to have mastered his best characteristics. He 
even has the incoherent mumbling, and rambling speech down to a science. 
The only real downside to Celebrity is the actual filmmaking. Although I 
give Woody Allen the benefit of the doubt with some of the edgy edits 
and odd camera movement, certain things are just unacceptable in a major 
film like this. Among these is the issue of continuity. In the beginning 
of one scene, Hank Azaria is cleanly shaved. Less than a minute later he 
is sporting scrappy facial hair. And there are other continuity problems 
with costume, hairstyle, and time of day.
When all is said and done, Celebrity is a far cry from Annie Hall or 
Manhattan, but certainly can hold it's own. Woody Allen is still very 
strong, and makes his statement with great effect. The cast makes this 
film a wonderful comic experience and well worth the while.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
The old saying is that you "shouldn't judge a book by its cover." 
Perhaps that is true in the field of fictional literature, and perhaps 
it is not. But it certainly doesn't hold true in Hollywood. Notting 
Hill, the first major motion picture from director Roger Michell, may 
not be overtly obvious from its title, but you needn't look much farther 
to discover what the production really is. The movie is a combination of 
the oldest, most proven plot in cinema, a love story; premium character 
humor; and top quality acting from two household names. This combination 
brings forth a brilliantly fun and beguiling film, that ranks among the 
best date films of the 90's. However, to quote the work itself, Notting 
Hill is "no Jane Austin." 
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is an American actress at the top of her 
field. She is considered to be one of the movie business' top leading 
ladies, and is even on the cover of Newsweek. With all of her fame has 
come financial success as well. For her latest film she was compensated 
$15 million. But Anna is forlorn. Much as Woody Allen demonstrated in 
Celebrity, fame has certain aspects that are not so glorious. And as a 
sexual icon, Anna experiences them all. The tabloids prey on her like an 
eagle on its dinner, and privacy is the rarest of things. She even 
resorts to checking into hotels under cartoon characters' names. 
William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a prosaic British man. He lives in 
Notting Hill, England, where his largest claim to fame is probably his 
blue house. He has the absolutely mundane job of running a travel book 
store so small that for a celebrity to enter would be an extraordinary, 
unprecedented event.
Keeping with the tradition of nearly every romance in the history of 
cinema, the two protagonists meet via an unusual set of circumstances 
and fall madly in love. In this case, the events include spilled orange 
juice, a poorly written travel book, and a shoplifter who uses his 
trousers for assistance. However, unlike most films of this genre, the 
great obstacle standing between William and Anna for the two hours that 
the film occupies, is not someone else, or something else, but 
themselves. Notting Hill is the story of opposites attracting, then 
being forced to deal with the opposites and still create a nirvanic 
state. In this sense the production goes one step further than, and 
actually deals with the realities that follow. 
Aside from being a wonderful romance, Notting Hill is a hilarious film. 
The humor is largely based on character traits, not punch line jokes, 
although some do find their way into the script. A good example is 
William's house maid, Spike (Rhys Ifans). His scraggly appearance mixed 
with the character's lack of responsibility make for a light, enjoyable 
moment every time he is on screen.
In order for a film of this nature to be successful, the acting must be 
stellar. Roberts and Grant make for an absolutely enchanting on screen 
duo. The two are different actors, one sporting an English accent and 
the other a perfect typecast for the pretty-girl-in-bad-industry role, 
as she displayed in Pretty Woman. The contrast makes their job of being 
opposites very simple. Everything from the looks they exchange before 
kissing to their use of the English language works perfectly for their 
roles. Although they have both done better work before, the two actors 
certainly don't slouch here.
A love story is a love story. Whether it be Bogart and Bergman, Grant 
and Roberts or the leads in a 3rd grade play, the plot is always the 
same. But with the finite amount of variance allowed, Notting Hill does 
stand out. Between the characters, the acting and the man-meet-woman 
plot, this film is a solid work. I promise Jane Austin is nowhere to be 
found here, and this is one that you can judge by its cover.

Title
Review for Center Stage (2000/I)
--A copy of this review can be found at
http://moviereviews.org/center_stage.htm ---
Most films that idealize, glorify or emphasize a profession have the
potential to be successful with an audience regardless of whether or not the
crowd is part of that profession. Example: it is rather easy to enjoy films
like `Any Given Sunday,' `For Love of the Game' and `The Color of Money'
despite the fact that the average viewer has never played professional
football, pitched a no-hitter or even ran a pool table. The same could be
applied to films with a more artistic core  `Bullets Over Broadway,'
`Bowfinger' and `This is Spinal Tap' all strike a cord with audiences even
though those audiences have, most likely, never written a play, directed an
independent film or been part of a heavy metal rock group. So it is that we
arrive at `Center Stage,' a film that although oftentimes sexy and dazzling
seems to disprove the above theory. The movie does everything in its power
to be a quality piece, the actors are stellar and the plot is decent enough
to pass in this era of poorly and hastily scrapped together scripts. Yet the
majority of the film's hardcore dance scenes  of which there are many  are
frighteningly unentertaining. The reason: it seems ballet might just be too
isolated an activity for outsiders to understand or be enthusiastic about.
Ironically, it is that very incestuous nature of the art that `Center Stage'
so beautifully depicts. During the course of the two-hour film, there is but
a single outsider who has a prominent role  predictably enough, he faces
rejection en route to ultimate acceptance. All the other figures in the film
are ballet students, instructors or administrators. There is no central
character but rather a handful of equally prominent people that rotate turns
being the center of attention (or, should I say, taking center stage?). All
part of the American Ballet Academy, a very select program at Lincoln
Center, they include Jody (the beautiful and talented Amanda Schull), a
young student striving to make it as a dancer; Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), a
master of the art who literally fled personal problems and must now return
to face them; Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a slightly more experienced pupil
than Jody, who will, during the course of the film, learn that there is more
to life than ballet and how much she hates her mother for forcing her into
being a ballerina (there's a new one!) and Eva (Zoe Saldana), a young girl
seeking direction who will only dance to the point at which she is happy and
doesn't much care if that her gets her anywhere or not (notice, she is the
only person in this film other than the aforementioned outsider who seems to
almost have her priorities in order).
Such misplaced priorities lead to the encouragement of near-anorexia, a
nonchalant attitude by most towards a bulimic character and quotes such as
`I don't want to go to college, I want to dance' being ultimately rewarded.
Furthermore, a sexual encounter that seems mighty improper doesn't quite
receive the wrath it deserves.
Interestingly, though, such sexual side plots could have served to better
the film if further explored. Had the filmmakers been willing to drop the
PG-13 rating and such silly tactics as the infamous `L' shaped covers used
by a couple the morning after an impromptu sexual encounter, the movie might
have taken on an angle that audiences could appreciate in lieu of trying to
decode the innermost workings of a ballet class filled with trade lingo that
might as well be gibberish.
Still, sexual appeal most certainly is not absent from the film. The group
of no-name actors and actresses are all extraordinarily attractive and
talented people that teenybopper crowds will likely take an interest in. No,
there probably is no Leo here, although Amanda Schull certainly could become
a female equivalent, but it is no mistake that the establishing shot of the
film is the number 15  the picture's target age group.
As the movie draws to a close, the incomprehensible ballet that the audience
has endured actually comes together for a rather enjoyable payoff scene 
after all, anyone can enjoy a ballet recital. Memories of the classic
musical `Fame' will likely come to mind and comparisons are bound to be
drawn. But don't kid yourself, `Center Stage' isn't going to live forever.

Title
Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
Shakespeare in Love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece 
ever made for the silver screen. It is both humorous and romantic in a 
very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the 
nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies. That is, however, not to say it 
is a good film, a quality production or anything of the sort. 
Shakespeare in Love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out 
to be very little quality or original work.
The finest sign of this may be the plot, in looking back, there seems to 
be little more than a thin, predictable plot that is only carried by the 
portrayal of people that we revere in our history books. Philip Henslowe 
(Geoffrey Rush) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in London. It is at the peak of 
the royal theatre era, and Queen Elizabeth (The recently Damed Judi 
Dench, by, appropriately enough, Queen Elizabeth II) is very much a fan. 
However, to directly quote the film, he has "cash flow problems." 
Through a long set of events, it becomes apparent that his entire life 
is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts.
So, Mr. Henslowe employs the young playwright, William Shakespeare 
(Joseph Fiennes) to pen a comedic production. However, the young writer 
has a severe case of writer's block, and blames it on the fact that his 
love life is struggling as well. He has the title in mind, Romeo and 
Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter (Even that joke loses steam after a while) 
but can't seem to put words to paper. Then, as only Hollywood could have 
it, through a long set of twisted events, he meets Viola De Lesseps 
(Gwyneth Paltrow) and falls madly in love, thus curing his writer's 
block. There are many other little issues that Mr. Henslowe encounters, 
but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing.
The first realization that I reached in watching this film is that one 
of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to 
it's author. Ironically, that couldn't be truer here. The great scenes 
that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot, 
but rather the recitals of Shakespearean lines by actors playing actors. 
One of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the 
character of Shakespeare or Queen Elizabeth or even the theatre owner, 
but rather 2 young children named Romeo and Juliet who chose to end 
their own lives in the name of love. So it is that I am offended by the 
fact that Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard are credited with writing this 
production, and the name William Shakespeare is no were to be seen 
beyond a character's name in the credits.
The acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point 
that it would not have survived even in Queen Elizabeth's theatres. 
Joseph Fiennes may just be the worst of fall though. He is tragically 
unbelievable and comically bad. Gwyneth Paltrow is little more than 
satisfactory in her lead position as well. However, the supporting cast 
does almost save the day. Geoffrey Rush is nothing short of incredible 
and Judi Dench is breathtaking. They both seem to have shown that as 
proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links. You will 
also find a very good performance by Ben Affleck in his first real role 
since Good Will Hunting (No, Armageddon doesn't qualify as real 
acting.). And Rupert Everett was cute in his small part as well. But not 
even they could save this sad excuse for a film, so it remains plagued 
by poor performances.
When all is said and done, Shakespeare in Love is only worth the trip if 
you want to be entertained. However, as the film so kindly pointed out, 
entertainment may be fun, but it isn't necessarily quality. And this 
certainly isn't quality. Perhaps this may be best compared to a John 
Grisham novel, as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his 
work. Simply put, it is far-fetched, poorly crafted, but very 
entertaining.

Title
Review for 200 Cigarettes (1999)
Ironically, one of the themes of 200 Cigarettes is that you should try to make
the best of every moment in life. Unfortunately I will no longer be able to say
that I lived every moment of my life to the fullest, because I spent 95
otherwise perfectly good minutes, watching this sad excuse for a movie.
Actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse
for you than it is to watch the movie. Not only is it a pathetically bad film
overall, but 200 Cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The
plot is scattered, thin and predictable; the acting is monumentally bad; and
the style of film making resembles a home video. 
It is December 31, 1981 and the big party is at Monica's (Martha Plimpton)
house. But no one has arrived yet. Her 8 invited guests and several people that
they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of New York
City in various groups. Some of them know each other through their common bond
of having slept with Monica, and some are total strangers. But they all are to
face their own personal neuroses before night's end. 
Those who are invited are the ones that have the issues. It is up to those who
aren't to help them come to terms. First there is Eric (Brian McCardie) who is
a former boyfriend of Monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their
relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance, or lack
thereof. He is one of the most bland characters, in a film full of dullness,
because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical, a common trait of this
poor production.
Bridget (Nicole Parker) and Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone) who are both
extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on
New Year's Eve and tag along to the party with them. They stumble across a
nameless bartender (Ben Affleck) who is the one truly perfect character in a
film of imperfections. He is nether sexually deprived, nor uncertain about his
future, as he is in law school. His lack of flaws is both boring, unrealistic
and painful to watch. As Bridget and Caitlyn make passes at him you are neither
entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy. 
Moving on, there is Val (Christina Ricci) and Stephie, (Gabby Hoffman) 2
teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts. Val is
Monica's cousin and a true fan of the New York scene. On the other hand,
Stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out
of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find.
Paradoxically, it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar (actually they attempt to
flee from their presence, but aren't successful) who guide them through their
fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds.
Of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples, only one approaches a level
of decency in both acting and plot. Wisely, the movie's creators have put heavy
emphasis on Lucy (Courtney Love) and Kevin (Paul Rudd) who are best friends and
share the common bond of being dateless. Paul has just broken up with long time
steady Ellie (Janeane Garofalo) and is starting to come to terms with his loss
when Lucy informs him that Ellie had been sleeping around during their
relationship. However, the only complexity to these two characters is that they
seem to want to be more than friends, and that is reiterated when they attempt
sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this
strange evening.
Finally, there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film.
Jack (Jay Mohr) and Cindy (Kate Hudson) have been going out for a short period
of time and Jack just learned that he took Cindy's virginity the night before.
While she attempts to play this down and be her usual self, he is a predictably
self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands
that includes the recently deflowered Cindy. 
Very often, when a film is as putrid as this production, there will at least be
a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory.
However, this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of
glory to be highlighted. Instead, what you get is a collection of rough and
inconsistent cuts, bad continuity and inaccuracies. First, and most noticeable
is that as the film goes from one subplot to another, there is no apparent
order that it follows, and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from
scene to scene and shot to shot. At other times, objects seem to get up and
move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot. There are also at
least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish. Not in a single one
of them does anybody pay the driver. 
And yet, no matter how miserable this film may be, and no matter how poor the
acting is all around, there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots.
Perhaps, if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or,
perhaps, even three, there might have been the time and opportunity for some
character development, or quality acting, or even a decent plot payoff at the
end. But it didn't happen that way. The cast of quality name actors was forced
into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance,
and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to
drop at midnight. 

Title
Review for 8MM (1999)
What is pornography? Is it the showing of forbidden areas on a human 
body? Do they need to be shown in a sexual fashion to constitute 
pornography? Does the goal of the exploitation have to be sexual 
gratification for the viewer? The Supreme Court of the United States of 
America once spoke of pornography, and gave the explanation "You know it 
when you see it." After seeing 8MM, the latest film from director Joel 
Schumacher, I am convinced that the Supreme Court was absolutely 
correct.
A multi-millionaire widow discovers an 8mm film in her husband's safe, 
in which a young girl appears to raped and murdered in a most violent 
fashion. So, her and her attorney hire private detective Tom Welles 
(Nicholas Cage) to look into the authenticity of the film, and determine 
whether or not this could be a real snuff film, or if the murder is 
faked. Welles assures her that the film must be fake, saying that snuff 
films are "basically an urban legend--makeup, special effects" 
However, nonetheless, he agrees to look into it. He decides that the 
most effective way would be to treat the girl in the film like a missing 
person, and see what turns up.
He soon finds the girl and discovers that she is, indeed missing, and 
had run away to Los Angeles, where she found a home in the underground 
porn industry. So Welles makes his way into this dark, sick, and 
disgusting underground world with the help of Max California (Joaquin 
Phoenix), a clerk at a porn store. And that is what this film deals 
with, the underground porn world, and the people involved with it. It 
introduces characters that star in and make these various S/M films 
which feature everything from the mild beatings and whippings, to lewd 
images of children in those acts, to bestiality. His goal is to find the 
people that dealt with this girl, and what happened to her.
He also finds the girl's mother, which becomes an interesting side 
plot to the story. The film deals with her coping with the loss of her 
only child for no apparent explanation. She becomes one of the films 
most intriguing characters, because her and Welles are the only people 
in this movie that average persons can relate to. And they are opposites 
of each other. She is dealing with the loss of a child and husband that 
has left her. He is a new father with a wife that is just starting to 
detect marriage problems due to his work.
At one point, Max California tells Welles that he will "see things you 
can't unsee." That is a drastic understatement, as Schumacher chose to 
allow the audience to view almost everything that Welles does. And some 
of the images are absolutely haunting. You, the audience member, ask 
yourself the questions that Welles is asking the people behind these 
films, namely "why?" It is incomprehensible to me how some of these 
people could exist in the real world, or how some of them could be sick 
enough to engage in these behaviors, and yet that is the most 
frightening element of this film, that people like those doe really 
exist.
With that said, my largest gripe with this film is it's rating. 
Probably due to the big names behind it, 8MM was issued an R rating by 
the MPAA. The first realization that I came to is that 8MM is not 
pornography in any way shape or form. It contains scenes and images that 
would, without question, constitute pornography, but it itself is not. 
What it is is a frighteningly real and intense film that audiences 
won't enjoy as much as be shocked by. And, as it is warned, you cannot 
unsee some of the things in this film, they just don't go away. For 
that reason, 8MM is more than deserving of an NC-17 rating, as films 
like Showgirls, Orgazmo, and Kids look like a humorous family films when 
in comparison.
Nicholas Cage is absolutely phenomenal in his role. He acts like your 
tour guide through this deep, dark underground world, and is masterful 
in doing so. At one point he holds a sick, twisted, murderer at his 
mercy, but cannot come to execute him. So he calls the victim's family 
and requests permission to do so. That is one of his moments of pure 
humanity. At other times he comes closer to insanity. Another scene 
features him with a different murderer, just muttering the question 
"why?" over and over. The response is chilling as he snaps "The things 
I do - I do them because I like them. Because I want to." That is what 
this film is about.
Director Joel Schumacher has once again created a dark film that is 
truly dark. Literally, less than 10 minutes of this film are in well-lit 
areas. That adds a creepy and intense feel to the film, which is backed 
up by a frightening score throughout the film, which is only substituted 
for an eerie silence. Quite literally, from the first scene, you find 
yourself on the edge of your seat, not because you don't know what 
will happen next, but rather because you are too scared to sit back.
When all is said and done, 8MM is a frightening, dark, intense movie 
that will stay with you for a long time. It has it's flaws in that 
some of the acting is less than ideal, and there may just be such a 
thing as too much darkness for one movie. But it is good in principal, 
and features a wonderful performance by Nicholas Cage, and one of the 
most amazing character studies since Hannibal Lector in The Silence of 
the Lambs. I only warn that "you see things you can't unsee."

Review for Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, The (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/flintstones_in_viva_rock_vegas,_the.htm ---
Alan Reed and Mel Blanc are probably rolling over in their graves. Joseph
Barbera and William Hanna might just go into shock. It's not that the latest
Flintstones movie, Viva Rock Vegas, which `posthumously' credits the latter
two as executive producers, is a live action interpretation of their classic
animated television series that will cause such reactions. Rather, it is
that the movie seems to lack all the non-material traits that made the 1960'
s series an integral part of American culture.
A prequel to both the 1994 film and the television series, this installment
of Bedrock's favorite two families actually pre-dates their being families.
Fred (Mark Addy) and Barney (Stephen Baldwin) are two young bachelors with
nothing but their lives ahead of them. Barney is optimistic, exclaiming `we
get to spend the rest of our lives working in a rock quarry  who says
dreams don't come true?' Fred, on the other hand, desperately seeks a
companion and realizes that this will require action, pointing out `it's not
like something is just going to drop out of the sky, land right in front of
you and change your whole life.' Being that the movie seems to have no
original humor, you can guess what happens as soon as Fred finishes the
aforementioned statement.
Enter Gazoo (Alan Cumming), the pint-sized alien who is temporarily expelled
from his own planet and banished to earth where he is to study human mating
rituals. This leads to numerous sexual jokes and an awkward homosexual scene
that shouldn't be in a film aimed at America's youngest moviegoers. It is
also most ironic that such a subplot is used in a film co-starring Kristen
Johnston (Wilma), an actress who has earned notice for her role in
television's `3rd Rock from the Sun'  a show with an all-too-similar plot.
Opposite Fred and Barney are Wilma and Betty (Jane Krakowski), who are
actually opposites themselves. Wilma is the classic poor-little-rich girl as
she struggles with pressure to marry Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson); she
is a citizen of the upperclass even though her heart is in the unruly valley
of Bedrock, which her mansion overlooks. Borrowing a chapter from another
abysmal movie, Titanic, it turns out that Rockefeller is even sleazier than
Wilma thinks with his sole purpose of luring her being that he needs her
fortune to escape some mob debts. For the mean time, he has Rocko (Danny
Woodburn) and Rocko (Tony Longo), his two `favorite made men' on his
pre-historic tail. And, should he not wed Wilma by a quickly-approaching
deadline, he will `be sleeping with the tunasaurus.'
Betty, on the other hand, is a single waitress with an average apartment and
constant smile on her face. She is hip, she is cool and she not only takes
Wilma under her wing but accepts a date with Fred even though his pickup
line is nothing but a series of incomprehensible grunts. Barney tags along
to make it a double date at the carnival and by night's end the couples have
swapped, Dino is born and Gazoo is viciously assaulted on a Ferris wheel.
The similarities between Fred and the Coen Brothers' Dude Lebowski, from The
Big Lebowski, are a few too many to go unnoticed and far too many to be what
Hanna and Barbera had in mind. Yes, they did create Fred's famous two-toe
bowling technique but surely they didn't mean for him to be the portly bum
he is here. Additionally, Wilma is far larger than she should be, Barney
decidedly more pathetic (how appropriate for one of the Baldwins if only
that old SNL skit would come true!) and Betty too promiscuous. Perhaps this
could be ignored, although it would certainly be difficult, if the film had
the guts to take off its training wheels and ride on its own rather than
take the time to pay homage to the original Flintstones couple in a mid-film
montage that only serves to remind of more pleasurable entertainment.
Just making matters worse, watching the scenes where the film does venture
astray from traditional Bedrock is like taking The Great Movie Ride over and
over for 90 minutes. Everything from significant plot lines to quick jokes
are stolen from movies ranging from Arsenic and Old Lace and some Three
Stooges pictures to the more recent Honeymoon in Vegas and Aladdin.
Yet, despite all the negative aspects of Viva Rock Vegas, I did discover a
tear streaming down my face right before the credits rolled. I wondered how
this could be and then it struck me  my contact lens had slipped.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/american_psycho.htm ---
Rarely has a film so funny, chilling and revealing as American Psycho graced
the silver screen. Mary Harron crosses certain borders in this equally
highbrow and gruesome study of the ultimate Reagan yuppie that few directors
have been brave enough to venture across before. Above all else, it is most
frightening that the film's funniest moments aren't the liquor-drenched
cocktail parties at which we are accustomed to laughing, but rather the
gruesome murders at which audiences have traditionally cringed.
Much like Alfred Hitchcock, Harron chooses to film her love and murder
scenes in an almost identical manner. The protagonist, Patrick Bateman (a
wonderfully eerie Christian Bail), controls these  parts of the movie,
gaining equal pleasure from sexual gratification and terminating life.
Bateman is always more comfortable than the women with whom he is having
sex, or the person he is killing, so he is able to pay meticulous attention
to the details of such acts. He knows which positions are the most arousing
and he knows which techniques make less of a mess than others.
Yet, the film's main character isn't a master at either practice. He leaves
sexual partners in distress and is occasionally conflicted about murders.
Bateman isn't perfect. Rather, he is an egotistical Harvard graduate with
salon quality facial products and a deep envy for those with finer business
cards or a more expensive apartment than his.
American Psycho opens with black credits set against a white background and
what appears to be blood dripping down the screen. The red drops prove to be
something else, yet the illusion remains strong. This sets the tone for a
film where many things are not what they manifest themselves to be, yet
their appearance is oftentimes more convincing than their actual being.
One thing that is very apparent, however, is the picture's setting. Harron's
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel (which I admit to not having read)
portrays an upper class Manhattan that only has some truths today, but was
very real in the 1980's. It is a place where a person's ability to swing
last minute reservations reflects upon his status, the make of a suit is
often guessed over write-off lunches (paid for, of course, with platinum
credit cards) and sexual harassment is no big deal. Given these definitions,
each member of the crowd is nothing more than Rene Magritte's Son of Man -
except for Bateman who is only unique in the most sick and twisted fashions
imaginable.
Bateman warns his colleagues that he is `simply not there' and `utterly
insane.' Yet, these words fall on deaf ears. As he chases a young girl with
nothing more than a chainsaw to cover his recently used sexual organ, it is
apparent that Bateman is indeed an American psycho. He has moments of mercy,
moments of brilliance and moments when he appears to be no more than that
Magritte painting. The film has similar characteristics. The audience is
saved from viewing even more gruesome and haunting images via several
off-screen murders; some plot devices have grown tired since being used in
Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross, Boiler Room, and other like films and
consequently lack the much needed freshness. But, at the end, it is the
moments when the movie achieves brilliance that stand out. Still, to many
audiences not prepared for such an intellectual bloodbath, the image
portrayed may well be that of insanity.

Title
Review for Story of Us, The (1999)
For over 90 minutes, The Story of Us innocuously runs through the 
projector. At film's end, the audience is not shocked. There are no 
great revelations, massive special effects or even unforgettable 
moments. That is, however, not to say that The Story of Us limps along, 
drags, or even approaches boredom. The movie is just a sweet and 
poignant work that is not today's typical Hollywood fare.
Ben (Bruce Willis) and Kate Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) have been married 
for 15 years and seem to be the ordinary couple. They have two kids, 
they each have their own job and close friends. But something has 
happened, and after they drop their children off for camp one summer, 
they each go home- Kate to the house and Ben to an apartment. The 
tagline on the film is "Can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage?" 
Evidently not. But over the course of the 8 week summer, Ben and Kate 
will discover if a separation can survive 8 weeks of separation.
Hall of fame singer, songwriter and guitarist Eric Clapton is credited 
with the music for this film. That is a little deceiving. Clapton did 
perform all the original music; the movie just neglects to mention that 
that entails all of one song. Good as it may be, that single track is 
overplayed to a point of annoyance, accompanying almost all of the 
film's montages. I only noted one other vocal performance, and it was 
indeed by Clapton. The song was "Wonderful Tonight," which I can assure 
you was not written for this production.
Willis and Pfeiffer are both at their best in this film. She is near 
perfect for her role, and he seems to have had no trouble adjusting from 
the role of "Oil drilling space hero" in last summer's Armageddon to 
"hopeless romantic" in this picture. A strong supporting cast fills the 
other roles in this predominately two person movie. Rita Wilson, Paul 
Reiser and Rob Reiner are all a pleasure to watch as the closest 
confidants of the separated couple. Also, Tim Matheson rather nicely 
portrays a divorced parent who Kate begins to date.
The Story of Us is not a typical film. Almost every movie these days has 
a side plot involving either a married couple or a close boyfriend and 
girlfriend. But those are extra scenes meant to attract female audiences 
and make certain films considered "date movies." The Story of Us does 
just the opposite. It even takes the reverse one step further. Rather 
than employing a side plot, the movie stays focused and never ventures 
astray from Ben and Kate's family. There was a time when singular plot 
films like this were normal. But today it is a rarity, and when strict 
one-plotters (especially romances) romances do surface, it is not often 
that they are of this quality.
---Editorial Criticism of the Motion Picture Association of America 
(MPAA)---
The MPAA rated The Story of Us "R". That means that children under the 
age of 17 cannot see this film, unless accompanied by a parent or 
guardian. The MPAA also rated Fight Club, the other major film opening 
the week of October 15, "R". Here is a comparison of the two films' 
offenses:
The MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, seem to believe that giving an 
identical warning to parents about these films will suffice. That's 
funny, because my parents always told me that sex and family were normal 
and okay things in life. I guess they skipped the parts about violence 
and destruction.

Title
Review for Big Tease, The (1999)
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/big_tease,_the.htm 
Breathing off the limited oxygen that Scottish and homosexual jokes can 
provide, The Big Tease makes the absolute most of its 86 minute 
life-span before its tank runs dry. Had the film not prudently cut off, 
and instead joined the infamous ranks of many current movies, I would 
not be able to declare it the funniest film of the century to date (take 
a second, think about it), a title of which it is well deserving.
Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) is the finest and most respected 
hairdresser in Glasgow, Scotland. When a much-deserved invitation 
arrives for him to go to America and compete in the World Freestyle 
Hairdressing Championship, a documentary crew decides to follow. Upon 
arrival, 12 minutes into the film, Crawford runs into problem after 
problem, not the least of which is that he wasn't actually invited to 
compete and has instead been offered a seat in the audience between 
Daniel Day Lewis and Carrot Top.
As Crawford's ego deftly guides him, he stumbles through obstacle after 
obstacle in his quest for the Platinum Scissors and to honorably 
represent all of Scotland. The most humorous moment comes when he needs 
a job to get his HAG (Hairdressers of America Guild) card and finds 
himself prepping animal costumes at a theme park, just an example of the 
many odd and hysterical situations he encounters.
In the spirit of last summer's most underrated film, Drop Dead Gorgeous, 
The Big Tease is a near-textbook mockumentary. Much of the film's humor 
can be credited to the constant spoofing of major competitions and the 
hairdressing industry. But don't expect this film to create many 
believers like Woody Allen's latest work, Sweet and Lowdown, or the 
smash hit The Blair Witch Project as that certainly isn't the intent 
here.  
The Big Tease perfectly captures and lampoons the essence of Hollywood; 
a cab driver carries around head shots, you need an appointment to get 
into anywhere and the elite know they're elite. But don't be mistaken, 
this is not a Hollywood film. Although the mammoth Warner Bros. is 
distributing the picture, it more closely resembles independent products 
like The Full Monty and The Castle than studio pieces.
Positive word-of-mouth should make The Big Tease a pleasantly surprising 
box office draw in the traditionally weak time between the release of 
Oscar contending films and the highly rated awards ceremony. Just don't 
expect any hair-splitting drama or overly flaky jokes.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
--- A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/scream_3.htm ---
The best part of Scream 3 is Jenny McCarthy in a ditsy
Hollywood-actress role that is humorous to both the uneducated
movie-going rookie and the seasoned Hitchcock fan (there are
references to his work throughout the film that the trained eye should
have a relatively easy time catching). Then, within 15 minutes of the
movie starting she.d'oh! It's okay though, because the second best
part of the movie is good old Liev Schreiber. Then, before the opening
credits even get started his character.d'oh! The third best thing?
Well, I'll have to think about it.
Obviously, the film is a teenage slasher flick. Not only do respected
actors and attractive Playmates get butchered, but a head roles, a
fire engulfs and some other victims have their last supper Benihana
style. The production, which actually prides itself in being and
spoofing a cliche-filled horror flick also uses flickering candle
light, bullet-proof vests, nightmares and, who could forget, a finale
in the dark.
Those of you not already acquainted with Scream and Scream 2 will
likely find little more than confusion in the third and final
installment which neglects to thoroughly lay out its
background. Basically, a third Stab movie is being made based on our
protagonist, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the rest of the
gang's frightening adventures a few years back. Someone involved in
making the movie decides it is time to butcher Sidney and Co., but,
for artistic reasons of course, chooses to do it in the order that
they are terminated in the script. From there, it is all chaos,
scream, blood and (a?)  masked murderer. Confused? Then you either
need to take a couple of trips to Blockbuster or, more wisely, forget
that this movie even exists.
Since the film does enjoy its status as a popcorn horror flick, many
jokes are cracked at the genre. Just as in Scream 2, the rules of
engagement are explained by an expert on sequels and trilogies- never
mind that he died in the last movie. Hardcore fans of the Scream trio
anticipate this scene as some sort of a holy grail. That is all fine
and good, but, unlike in the previous works, our expert proves to be
wrong.
Horror junkies who are familiar with Hitchcock will find some nicely
tucked away jokes throughout Scream 3. Similarly, those familiar with
the underground success of Silent Bob and Jay will be pleasantly
surprised to see them cameo even though Kevin Smith isn't involved
with this movie.
Although the aforementioned cinema tidbits are stashed away throughout
the work, don't expect to find any deep meaning or social commentary
in your excavations. The movie does attempt to touch on family ties
and the psychology of a homicidal maniac, but things get just about as
deep as the knife in Jenny McCarthy's throat.
The movie also has some more minor faults that hardly help its case. A
fine example is when star Courtney Cox's hair grows about 16 inches in
three minutes. It is also interesting that obvious victims are always
abandoned by their bodyguards or the police right before they either
answer a scary phone call or meet their destiny.
The third best thing? Hmm. I got it! The establishing shot of the
movie: the famous Hollywood sign. Maybe that is some sort of
foreshadowing.

Title
Review for Simply Irresistible (1999)
Simply Irresistible is not only an extraordinary romantic film, but it 
is an incredibly entertaining, fun, and flat out enjoyable movie as 
well. In a time when filmmakers have committed to making bold moves and 
trying to declare political statements in their works, it is a real 
pleasure to see freshman director Mark Tarlov make a debut film that 
audiences can truly enjoy. And although this film may not be 
intellectually challenging, or the type of production that forces people 
to struggle with themselves over issues that effect their day to day 
lives; it is nice to get a break from that type of cinema once in a 
while.
The plot that Judith Roberts has created is the key force behind this 
film. Amanda Shelton (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has inherited her mother's 
restaurant in New York City which is really little more than a room with 
some tables, a kitchen, and a few regulars who eat lunch there daily. 
Amanda is the head chef, and although her food is bland, simple, and 
unoriginal, she has managed to make ends meet. However, as early as the 
second scene, only after the memorable first scene where she chases a 
crab up her destined lover's leg, Amanda discovers that her rent has 
been raised and she will be forced to close.
After the movie quickly does away with the necessary background 
information, the enchanting love story begins. Amanda runs into the man 
whose leg she had pursued earlier, a wealthy man named Tom (Sean Patrick 
Flanery), who is opening up a $4 million restaurant uptown. And, as a 
matter of the obvious, they fall madly and deeply in love. From there it 
is just a series romantic and comedic moments that will enlighten all 
that see this film. The key to enjoying this wonderful comedy is 
suspending all belief before the film ever begins. Certainly not 
realistic, you must come to the understanding that it is all far-fetched 
fiction filled with magic, and that is why it is so uniquely joyful to 
view.
Acing is very rarely a factor in romantic comedies, and therefore is 
often limited to that of a second class nature. That certainly would 
have been acceptable here, and the film probably would have worked with 
anyone in the lead roles. But the casting was brilliant, and the acting 
is truly grade A. Teenage sensation Sarah Michelle Gellar, better known 
to her fans as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," is absolutely charming in her 
lead role. She surely has a future in the film business, despite what 
some skeptics may say. Dylan Baker has a supporting role in this film 
that shows us that he can act in non-dramatic productions as well. Any 
doubt of his comic ability, after his Oscar caliber performance in 
Happiness, should be shed now, and hopefully Hollywood will accept him 
as a mainstream actor soon. However, despite those 2 great performances, 
Sean Patrick Flanery outdoes everyone. Often similar to Michael J. Fox, 
he is absolutely marvelous, and one of the pillars that holds this film 
so strong.
Overall, Simply Irresistible is a wonderful film. Filled with moments of 
magic, romance and comedy alike, it is a pleasure to watch. I applaud 
Director Mark Tarlov for making a film that is the way the movies were 
meant to be: Entertaining!

Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
Life is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella) is an example of a good movie that 
people have decided to make great. Do not be mistaken, it is not the 
best foreign fare of 1998, nor even close to the finest (my personal 
favorite being the Iranian Taste of Cherry). But the movie is a solid 
work and wholesome reminder of the Holocaust. The film follows a father 
and son through a concentration camp, and shows the father's attempts to 
ease the son's pain by convincing him it is all an elaborate game. 
Roberto Benigni won best actor for this production, just one of many 
undeserved awards that the movie garnered. Yet, the work is still leaps 
and bounds superior to the recent Jakob the Liar and the best Italian 
film to make it across the Atlantic since the 1994 romantic masterpiece, 
Il Postino.

Title
Review for Tea with Mussolini (1999)
Recently, there have been several movies using WWII as their background.
Three of the five films nominated for Best Picture at the 1998 Academy
Awards - Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, and The Thin Red Line - all
used this period as their political setting. Franco Zeffirelli's Tea with
Mussolini is the latest film to take place during this time frame. By using
a wonderful blend of plot and history, Zeffirelli proves that this backdrop
is still far from overused.
Much of Tea with Mussolini is a history lesson. The production begins in
Italy in 1935, continuing until 1942. The story takes place in Mussolini's
homeland the entire time. The film is careful to be as historically accurate
as possible, announcing several key dates as they occur during the seven
year span, and carefully portraying the various European political opinions
from the war. A fine example of this is when an Italian man dismisses the
rumors of Jewish suffering as "Pink Propaganda." This historic accuracy
allows for the all important backdrop of the film to be as smooth as
possible.
The protagonist of Zeffirelli's latest work is Luca Innocenti (Baird Wallace
as a child and Charlie Lucas as a teenager), a child born out of wedlock,
and therefore unrecognized by his father. Luca is cared for by his father's
employee, Mary (Joan Plowright) and her group of friends. Known as the
"Scorpioni," this group of eccentric women consists of Lady Hester (Maggie
Smith), Georgia (Lily Tomlin), Arabella (Dame Judi Dench) and the American,
Elsa (Cher). These ladies all look after Luca as he comes of age during the
film's seven year span. In addition, they look after themselves, all being
British with the exception of Elsa, and therefore enemies of Italy once the
nation enters into the war.
Tea with Mussolini features a rather impressive cast of proven actresses.
Unfortunately, Cher, one of the leads, fails to perform to her potential.
One such display of her substandard acting is in a scene that requires her
to be crying on her bed, in a state of hysterical denial. Not only is she
unrealistic, but her pathetic acting is almost comical at this key point of
the film, thus damaging the otherwise excellent production. Fortunately
though, Baird Wallace, who portrays the teenage Luca, is absolutely stunning
in his debut performance. Ironically, this is never more apparent than in a
part of the film where his character is alone in a room with Cher's
character, and is being asked to do her a favor. Not only does he carry
himself well enough to make the scene work, but his talent even manages to
make Cher look decent for that fleeting moment.
Don't be fooled by the big name studio behind this production. Although MGM
did make the film, it is far from a typical Hollywood work. Actually filmed
entirely overseas, Tea with Mussolini plays like an exceptional independent
film. The scenery is rich, the costumes are simple, and there are no special
effects in sight. Altogether, this gives the film a very warm and personal
touch for which Zeffirelli should be applauded.
Tea with Mussolini is a production well worth the price of a ticket. This
movie is not the greatest of 1999, and is injured by Cher's performance, or
lack thereof. But on the flip side, there is a wonderful plot interwoven
with history. Because of that history, and the marvelous setting it
provides, you realize that WWII certainly hasn't gone out of style, and Tea
with Mussolini may never.

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
Runaway Bride has the same characters, lead cast, director, and genre as 
the 1990 hit, Pretty Woman. Yet it simply isn't as good as its 
antecedent, because the plot can only work one time before becoming over 
used, or perhaps because the R rated sexual humor from Runaway Bride's 
nine year predecessor is largely absent this time in favor of a family 
friendly PG rating.
Julia Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter, a woman who has three times used 
her walk down the aisle as a warm up to the sprint that soon followed as 
she escaped the wedding vows. A very flirtatious and beautiful woman, 
she seems to have no qualms about going from man to man. Her father even 
quips "She may not be the longest running joke in town, but she sure is 
the fastest." Roberts' portrayal of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman was very 
similar if not identical.
In Pretty Woman, Vivian began to reform when a very conservative man, 
Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) entered her life. Nearly a decade later, 
Gere does it again when he enters Maggie's life as a New York City 
newspaper reporter, Ike Graham. Continuing with the long list of 
similarities, Runaway Bride includes a scene where Gere has to negotiate 
to buy Roberts' time and attention, and another where he takes her dress 
shopping- perhaps the two most memorable and acclaim scenes from Pretty 
Woman.      
Runaway Bride is a visually astounding film. The panoply of scenery is 
never better highlighted than the opening sequence where images of a 
horse trotting through a field in the marvelous country side are quickly 
cut to images of New York City. The many scenes out of city are 
beautifully framed with lovely background and pastel colors. The city 
scenes are more edgy and harsh visually, providing a nice juxtaposition 
of the opposite lifestyles that collide.
The only sexual jokes you'll find in Runaway Bride come from Maggie's 
grandmother, and are watered down references to "the one eyed monster" 
and its duties on the wedding night. The biggest laughs come from hair 
dye and a cheesy FedEx joke about on-time delivery. You can't help but 
miss the numerous references to condoms, drugs, and prostitution that 
the jokes in Pretty Woman provided, creating far bigger laughs than 
anything you'll find here.  
Runaway Bride holds itself to a higher standard by choosing to display 
numerous similarities to Pretty Woman, and never being the slightest bit 
shy about it. Because of that, it ends up committing a suicide of sorts; 
having attempted to shoot for the stars and not being willing to settle 
for the sky instead. At one point in the film, Ike explains his 
profession by saying "We push, we stretch, we go out on a limb." Runaway 
Bride does just that, it pushes, it stretches, and it goes out on a 
limb. But I think the limb just snapped. 

Title
Review for Rounders (1998)
What is a movie that has no apparent morals, encourages illegal 
practices, and features it toughest character in a one-piece jump suit? 
Is it a testimony to a great plot, or a circus sideshow gone horribly 
astray? When Rounders starts it's 2-hour duration it is clearly leaning 
toward the latter of the 2 options. And yet, when the last reel is over 
and all is said done, the film is so much more than a testimony to the 
great plot it is made of. In-between the beginning and end there is a 
line that is treaded by this unique film that often resembles a line 
between genius and insanity. And those elements are no less diverse as 
both the positive and negative of this film. But, as it is nice to see 
once in a while, the positive elements prevail here.
Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a small time poker player in New York 
City. He sits with the best in the world, everyone from "grinders," 
those who make a living at the poker table, to Russian mobsters that are 
connected all the way up. His best friend, and long time partner, is 
incarcerated for credit card fraud. His social life has been steady 
lately, as he lives with his girlfriend outside of the law school campus 
that he attends. His main focus is his studies, and he has the ability 
to be one of the best lawyers in his class.
Everything in Mike McDermott's life is a constant, stable, chain link. 
Even his gambling at the poker table is a calculated risk. So what 
happens when he has a hand of poker that goes wrong? He quits the game, 
hoping not to throw off the balance of his life. But everything in his 
life will change when his best friend, Lester "Worm" Murphy (Edward 
Norton) is released from prison, and finds himself $25,000 in debt to 
the Russian mob. Choices are limited, and being a lifelong friend, Mike 
takes the game back, in an attempt to come up with the cash to bail his 
best pal out. The catch: A chain link fence is only as strong as the 
weakest link.
Rounders is not just a movie about the glories of poker, it is about a 
person finding himself, and what he really is. It is not a collection of 
explanations of rules, or wagering policies, but rather a complex 
character study. The unique thread of this study is that McDermott is 
the only vulnerable character in the film, in the sense that everyone 
else has already achieved a rhythm in their life and discovered who they 
really are.
It is very rare that a group of actors with as much recognition as this 
cast will assemble for a film, and all turn out four star performances. 
However, that does occur here. Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Martin Landau, 
John Turturro and Gretchen Mole are all excellent in their parts. The 
chemistry seems to work so well since they all portray vastly different 
characters, one of the advantages that the vastly rich script provides 
for.
And yet this wonderful film comes with one major caveat that adds a 
negative side to this work that is nearly equivalent to the positive, 
but thankfully not entirely. If you do not know how to play several 
types of poker or at least understand the rules of the games, you will 
be utterly bored for 120 minutes. Despite the successful attempt to lure 
the film away from cards to character development, there is still a 
heavy emphasis put on cards and the assumption that all viewers already 
know the rules of the games.
The bottom line when you look at Rounders is that when all has been said 
and done, a lot more ends up said then done. Does this takeaway from a 
potentially great film? Somewhat. Is the aforementioned caveat to the 
film's incredible entertainment value a major loss? Well, not 
necessarily. For some viewers, especially those experienced in the field 
of card games, it only adds to the most enjoyable experience. And yet, 
for those who are not as knowledgeable, this film can seem like an 
eternity at times, and that costs it most of, if not all of it's 
value. So, I am going to compromise

Title
Review for Return to Me (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/return_to_me.htm ---
Comparisons between Return to Me, the directorial debut of actress Bonnie
Hunt, and Keeping the Faith, the directorial debut of actor Edward Norton,
are bound to be drawn. This is a problem for Return to Me given that
although it is a cute and oftentimes enjoyable date film, it lacks the
intellectual breadth of Keeping the Faith. Hunt is an obviously freshman
director afraid of taking the risks necessary to transform her film from the
hardly-average date fare that it is to the bold, intellectual and far
funnier movie that Norton created.
Return to Me opens with a shot reminiscent of that introducing Federico
Fellini's La Dolce vita: the camera pans in from a wide view of downtown
Chicago to a close-up of Bob Rueland (a solid David Duchovny). Read: he is
free in a limitless world. Then we meet Grace Briggs (a very cute Minnie
Driver who's smile is second only to the $20 million Julia Roberts'),
pail-faced and confined to a hospital bed with a tube under her nose, via a
tight face-shot. Read: it will take an amazing grace to save this dying
young woman.
That grace comes in the form of Bob's wife. She dies suddenly one evening
and soon her main artery is in Grace's chest. After a year of Bob mourning
his wife who was as much married to her job as him, and Grace recovering,
the destined couple meet and commence dating without either knowing the
incredible coincidence that they share. This is a mistake of the film's as
seeing the subject dodged is annoying and oftentimes requires over-silly
techniques. The picture would be far more interesting had a scenario where
the couple knew about this early on been created. This would allow the film
to deal with some of the more philosophical issues of organ-donating and not
be forced to skirt the matter in the name of a cuteness that quite frankly
isn't that cute.
Grace's closest people to a family are the four elderly men, including her
grandfather, who run the family-style Irish-Italian restaurant where she
works. The motley crew has a nightly beer and poker fest very much
reminiscent of the old Saturday Night Live `Da' Bears!' sketches, only
substituting The Rat Pack for Chicago football. It is unfortunate that these
characters are the most entertaining part of the film as they do little to
further the plot or add depth to the main characters.
Bob's closest friend is Charlie Johnson (an excellent David Alan Grier), an
African-American veterinarian who was equally close with Bob's wife when she
was alive. A relatively sensible and conservative man by day, Charlie
transforms into a rude social animal come sun down. His character serves as
the confidant that Bob needs for everything except Bob's all-important
ventures into dating.
As Return to Me grows even more confused towards the end, the film takes on
some elements not dissimilar to As Good As It Gets in terms of plot. But the
quality of romance and humor never nears that of the 1997 film. Grace's
first line is `Rosebud.' The intellect never nears that legendary film
either. But for that matter, not much even nears the price of admission.

Title
Review for Election (1999)
Matthew Broderick and high school comedy. The two terms have been 
practically inseparable since Ferris Buehler took the day off in 1986. 
Now it is 13 years later, and Broderick has another high school comedy, 
Election, to show the world. Ferris Buehler's Day Off showed an 
educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows. It was 
light, fluffy, tasty, and sparkling clean. But Election is far 
different. This production is a dark, and frighteningly realistic one 
that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies; 
it shocks as well.
Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the type of teacher that makes 
American high schools proud. He is a kind, caring, younger man who has 
built his life around Carver High School. In turn, Carver High School 
has provided a home for him. Jim has won teacher of the year no less 
than three times in his 12 year span, and is a well respected social 
studies teacher among the student body.
Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an intelligent, outgoing, and, to 
quote the film, "super nice" young girl. She is involved in numerous 
extracurricular activities, always has her hand up first in class, and 
is extremely popular among most of the student body. So, it is a natural 
progression when she decides to run for school president.
The Metzler family is an extremely wealthy one. The father, Dick (Holmes 
Osborne), owns a cement company. The mother, Jo (Jeanine Jackson), is an 
ideal housewife. And the two children, Paul (Chris Klein) and Tammy 
(Jessica Campbell), are both students at Carver High School. Paul was 
the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself, and is 
definitely a candidate for most popular person in school. Tammy is a 
lesbian who, to say the least, is going through a period of self 
discovery.     
For reasons of revenge, hatred, and sexual envy, Jim convinces Paul to 
run against Tracy for school president. He claims that in a democracy 
you need choices, and having Tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship 
of sorts. So Paul agrees and the race is on. But then, in an effort to 
spite the two candidates, Tammy announces that she is running as well. 
Her campaign is straightforward: People only run to put it on their 
college applications, then they do nothing. Well, "I don't even want to 
go to college," she says.
In Election, there are no "good guys". Almost everyone has their own 
agenda. No matter how deeply hidden, the production digs it up and 
exploits it for the audience. Tracy is the type of person that you 
remember from high school. She is the girl that would be labeled "Most 
likely to achieve anything she wants" in the yearbook, and everyone 
secretly envied her because of that. Jim is a teacher that takes the 
trust that students give him as a privilege, and uses it to his own 
amoral advantage. Everyone, including the principal, a former teacher, 
all the candidates, and even Paul's girlfriend are two sided characters. 
That is much of this film's beauty, it doesn't have the typical good 
guys that Hollywood likes, instead it is a realistic portrayal of the 
real world, specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions 
that people usually keep to themselves.
Matthew Broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role. His 
character is often similar Bill Murray's award winning role in the 1998 
film, Rushmore. Of the two acting jobs, Broderick's is far superior. But 
even he is overshadowed by the young Reese Witherspoon. The hatred that 
she causes the audience to develop towards her, is simply indescribable. 
Broderick and Witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing 
off each other in various scenes. One such moment occurs when she 
approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day. You can see 
her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures, 
making her an eligible candidate. And his subtle disgust with her is 
apparent, although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to 
put on a happy face.
The supporting cast is one with little Hollywood experience. But that is 
far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part. However, the 
real treat is Jessica Campbell in her confused role as a young 
homosexual girl. This is never more apparent than the scene where she 
delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency. 
She is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an 
unjust system is expressed.
If Ferris Buehler made you feel good about American high schools, and 
gave you an innocent laugh or two, then the movie achieved its goal. But 
don't you dare think that Election's goals are similar. It is just as 
real in its portrayal of high school, as its characters are in the real 
world. There certainly is no pile of marshmallows here.

Title
Review for Black and White (1999)
---Please note, a copy of this review will be posted to
http://www.moviereviews.org/black_and_white.htm ---
Imagine Larry Clark's Kids with big name stars and a director conflicted
about what can and cannot be shown on screen. The shock value is lost. That
is exactly what Black and White is, an honest look at the streets of New
York City that has little effect on the viewer.
The film opens with a certain sexual act involving two Caucasian girls and
an African-American guy in the not-so-thick woods. Little kids look on as
their presumably virgin-eyes are corrupted. This is undoubtedly the film's
most effective scene because a) the three actors are unknown to most
audiences, which provides a certain reality, and b) it is the most graphic
that the movie has to offer. From there on, everything is downhill.
Director James Toback attempts to tap one of Generation X's most peculiar
traits: upper-class white teenagers attempting to infiltrate lower-class
black society. His characters can be divided into three basic groups:
trust-fund teens that meet the above criteria, poor black teens that want to
make a better life for themselves and poor black teens that seem to
altogether lack such drive. He also includes a freelance documentary
filmmaker (Brooke Shields), her gay husband (Robert Downey Jr. who is one of
the film's highlights), boxer Mike Tyson (as himself) and a disgruntled
undercover detective (Ben Stiller).
The language used in Black and White is, in a way, very revealing. A
classroom scene shows that the teenagers' teachers care. Yet their
vocabularies are a dense version of broken English perhaps most similar to
Ebonics. Although the infamous language of Mark Furman is considered
derogatory, a similar word, `niga,' apparently isn't. In the aforementioned
class, kids swear and no one flinches. Yet when such language is used at
fancy dinner tables, the teens' parents are outraged. There is a great
contradiction between street settings and home settings, yet the movie's
subjects haven't figured that out.
Mid-film finds one of the few actual plot moments;  a murder is committed.
The most surprising thing about this scene isn't that the New York City
District Attorney's son commits the murder or that the victim dies almost
immediately, but rather the tame nature of how this is shown. For a film
that apparently seeks to shock, a little blood might have been appropriate.
The same can be said of the sex, or lack thereof. Other than the
aforementioned opening, no such acts are shown on screen. The characters
constantly talk about it, and much happens off screen, but Toback seems to
have gotten scared for reasons unapparent to this critic. Perhaps it is that
big name stars like Elijah Wood, Claudia Schiffer and Gaby Hoffman aren't
willing to show themselves on screen; an argument for a lesser-known cast.
The ultimate goal of Black and White is to make the viewer ask him or
herself questions. Here's one to start with: `What else is playing at the
local theatre?'

Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
***I would like to recognize the passing of George C. Scott this week. 
He was a fine actor who delivered one of the great monologues in film 
history in Patton. May he rest in peace.***
Double Jeopardy comes at the beginning of a fall movie season that is 
expected to be one of the film business' best, both artistically and 
financially. Unfortunately, the movie serves as a reminder that those 
two qualities do not always go hand-and-hand. The production's big name 
stars and run-from-the-law plot will likely deliver big bucks for 
Paramount despite a noticeable absence of quality.
Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) is a happily married woman enjoying the 
success of her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood) and very much involved 
with their son, Matty. An abrupt change occurs when she spends a 
romantic weekend on a sailboat with Nick. While at sea she finds herself 
framed for his bloody murder. Not too much later, she is behind bars, 
having put her son in the custody of her best friend, Angie (Annabeth 
Gish).
Angie disappears soon after Libby is imprisoned. With the help of some 
fellow inmates, the accused murderer finds her friend living in San 
Francisco with Matty - and the very much alive Nick. Libby doesn't 
pursue revenge while in prison, but rather patiently waits for her 
parole (advice that she gets from the same two aforementioned inmates 
that welcome her with open arms for no
apparent reason and seem to help her with everything accordingly). One 
of the two inmates used to be a lawyer and explains that since Libby is 
already convicted of murdering her husband, she cannot be tried again 
under the fifth amendment, which states "No person (shall)...be subject 
for the some offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."
After a suspiciously short period of time for a convicted murderer, 
Libby is paroled to a halfway-house under the supervision of Travis 
Lehman (Academy Award winner Tommy Lee Jones). From there, the search 
for her beloved son is on. One night, her quest keeps her out after 
curfew. She realizes this and flees the state. Travis follows in 
pursuit, thus creating a manhunt of a manhunt. The rest of the film is 
as cliched as one might imagine, with the payoff scene having plot 
twists that hardly catch the audience by surprise.
Ever since James Bond came along, some films have gained a certain 
immunity to the laws of realistically conceivable plots. Double Jeopardy 
abuses that privilege to the nth degree. Although the fifth amendment 
clause is not too farfetched, certain not-so-small details are. I am 
quite confident that Libby's possessing a murder weapon, ruining at 
least two cars, constant fleeing of states, breaking and entering a 
school and destruction of federal property might just be enough land her 
back behind bars. It also strikes me as particularly amazing that the 
police always seem to show up at just the right moment and Libby always 
manages to escape by tripping up the officers Keystone Cops style. 
Ironically, it is the same branch of government that manages to convict 
her so quickly and efficiently in the beginning, even without a body to 
show the jury.
The brief, yet all important, scenes in prison reek of deja vu. The 
two inmates that guide Libby are pulled right out of The Spitfire Grill. 
At the same time, I was reminded of the film I saw just before Double 
Jeopardy. At the end of Mumford, a reference is made to a certain prison 
as "a country club." That doesn't seem to be far from the case here, as 
other than a little labor, the penitentiary is filled with lively 
chatter, fun and games.
If ever there were proof that acting cannot compensate for a faulty 
script, it is here. Ashley Judd is just as good as she was in Heat, A 
Time To Kill, and Norma Jean and Marilyn (A made for HBO film where she 
portrayed Norma Jean and garnered several award nominations). But the 
real treat is Tommy Lee Jones who seems to have the on-the-run film down 
to a science after his critically acclaimed role in The Fugitive and the 
more recent U. S. Marshals. The two actors are very rarely on screen 
together, as the nature of their roles requires that they be in pursuit 
of each other. However, one scene that they do share carries a rare 
emotional feeling in a movie polluted with trucks speeding on sidewalks 
and action stunts of a similar nature.
Some many years from now, when the biographies of Ashley Judd and Tommy 
Lee Jones are written, this film will be conveniently left out as not 
even their two performances will save it from the fate of joining the 
"Employee Choices" rack at Blockbuster and the ranks of pay-television 
marathons. Probably, this is the last sentence you will ever read about 
Double Jeopardy.

Title
Review for Boiler Room (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/boiler_room.htm ---
Boiler Room, the first hardcore stock exchange film since 1988's Wall
Street, is one of the most spellbinding thrillers in recent years. Two hours
haven't moved so quickly since America was transfixed on a white Ford
Bronco, the Los Angeles Freeway and a national hero with a gun to his head.
(Speaking of which, why hasn't anyone bought the movie rights? Allison
Janney would be the perfect Marcia Clark!)
Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) has dropped out of college and started a casino in
his New York apartment complete with specialized house chips, porno
magazines and foul language. He no longer needs a student loan check to make
rent; portraits of Benjamin Franklin accumulate via this underground
business. Seth's father (Ron Rifkin who is a dead ringer for Ed Harris 10
years down the road), a respected Judge, isn't totally blind to his son's
doings and ultimately confronts him, sending an already rocky father-son
relationship into pure turmoil.
Seth decides that the New York Stock Exchange, in essence the world's
largest "legal" casino, is the place for him and takes a job at J. T.
Marlin, a brokerage just outside of town- trying to impress  his father. The
firm is full of 20-something millionaires, over-stuffed rolodexes, expensive
suits, fine Italian-leather chairs and sheer decadence. The money is so easy
to make because the stocks being pitched don't exist. Yes, J. T. Marlin is a
stock chop-shop, and like all fascinating scams, the FBI has its eyes
fixated on this one and, more importantly, our protagonist.
The workaholic society portrayed is not unlike many modern-day war room
businesses; Steve Jobs' and Bill Gates' empires closely resemble J. T.
Marlin in their dedication to working more hours than exist in a normal day.
In the beginning of the film, when you suspect little more than hard work
and dedication has led to the abundance of wealth, you want to somehow enter
the silver screen and become part of the culture. After all, Marlin's
workers are guaranteed their first million within three years, the secretary
makes $80,000 and last month's phone bill was a tad under the nonchalant
$400,000 mark. But as things progress and you learn more and more about the
poor folks who lose their money in the massive scam, a middle-class man
named Harry Reynard (Taylor Nichols) in particular, you become more and more
comfy in your seat and appreciate the distance between yourself and the
screen.
The initially sexy appeal of J. T. Marlin is helped by Jim Young (Ben
Affleck)'s pitch to new recruits. The so-called "group interview" is little
more than his ruthless sales tactics at their best with the aid of several
f-words and the re-assuring tagline "We don't hire brokers here. We train
new ones." But future mottos prove less appealing, like a "don't pitch the
bitch" anti-woman philosophy. Ultimately, when all rosy images are brushed
away and Seth reflects on his casino, the truth is more evident than ever,
"the illegal business I was running was the most legitimate thing I had
going."

Title
Review for Mystery, Alaska (1999)
Unfortunately, there is little mystery in this film. Following in the 
footsteps of Rocky; Hoosiers; Rudy; The Mighty Ducks; and on and on, 
Mystery, Alaska is yet another underdog sports movie where the audience 
is made to wait over an hour for an inevitable final match that will 
surely come down to the last seconds. This film will likely be buried 
quickly in the always hectic fall film season.
With a population of just under 700, the town of Mystery, Alaska is 
small, homely and most everyone knows everyone; the biggest threat is 
the invasion of a mega-store and its potential harm to the status quo of 
their economy.
Once a week, the town gathers around a frozen pond for a near-religious 
experience: The Saturday Hockey Game. The players are selected by a 
special committee and are the pride of Mystery. The matches are always 
friendly as the pool of athletes is randomly divided into teams just 
before game time.
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a Mystery native, has left the town and is 
now working in New York with a television station. He remembers the old 
town games and thinks, just as Kevin Bacon thought in The Air Up There, 
that these local players might be on par with the multimillionaire 
athletes seen every weekend on television. He writes a feel-good article 
for a popular magazine and soon after returns to Mystery with the 
promise of an exhibition game, against the New York Rangers, to be 
broadcast for the whole world to see. To Charles it is a fluff piece 
that will make him money, to the Rangers it is a joke and waste of time, 
to Mystery it is a game for pride - the pride of knowing that their 
boys are just as good as any others.
The makers of Mystery, Alaska learned a lesson from Fargo: No matter how 
snowy and accent-heavy your setting, a complementary side plot is still 
necessary. In this case sexual relationships are the added oomph. 
Although premature ejaculations; teenage soap-opera relationships; 
adultery with a friend of the spouse and old crushes revisited are far 
from uncharted territory, they are portrayed here in a surprisingly bold 
manner for a sports film.
The production skates dangerously close to the realm of melodrama. One 
of the low points comes mid-film and pits the town of Mystery, in court, 
with the National Hockey League Players Union. The issue is whether or 
not the Rangers will be forced to play in the game all the way across 
the country during one of their much-valued breaks. Aside from having an 
obvious outcome, if there is no game, there is no movie, this section is 
particularly pathetic because two of Hollywood's last resort dramatic 
elements are used: a court scene and a key character's death.
There are three funny roles in Mystery, Alaska: Mike Myers, Beth 
Littleford and Michael McKean. Myers has a cameo, McKean has two scenes 
and Littleford isn't exactly a prominent character. Other than those, 
there is not much good about this film; the drama is weak and the payoff 
is predictable. Maybe the Rangers had the right idea in trying to stay 
home.

Title
Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
The 13th Warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it 
carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue. The 
best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing 
credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely 
white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the 
projector. My vote goes for the ending credits, where you can start 
trying to put the awful experience behind you.
Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is an important official who is banished 
from his home for sleeping with another man's wife. He encounters a 
group of Norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious 
journey to be taken by 13 men. Fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last 
warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that 
numerous persons at the screening I attended broke out into laughter.
The movie proves to be a new low point for Banderas, who's acting 
seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying 
gay man in 1993's Philadelphia, than that of a warrior. In the 
film's supposed pay off scene, he exclaims "I was wrong, these are not 
men!", a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production. 
Unfortunately, Banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes Chevy 
Chase's career look like Oscar material.
The film, based on Michael Crichton's best selling novel, Eaters of 
the Dead was shot under that name some three years ago, and after 
numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony, but 
the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
At the same time, The 13th Warrior makes you think about numerous 
questions. Questions like "Why do the characters always have perfect 
lighting on them even when it is pitch dark?", "Why does no one ever 
have blood cover both sides of their face, but rather just one side?" 
and finally, "Will the manager give me a refund?"
90 minutes into the 103 minute film, a man invites of the warriors "Come 
with me, there is a woman who can help." Unfortunately, there is nothing 
that could help this film. The most appropriate ending would have been 
for the 13 men to join hands, form a chorus line, and break into a 
rendition of "Springtime for Hitler."

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
American Beauty is a sitcom on the surface, but a remarkable social 
commentary laced with dark humor and thorough character development can 
be found just below. Kevin Spacey gives a performance, in what may be 
one of the great films of our time, that will surely garner him an 
Academy Award nomination.
Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) lives an every-man life filled with 
misery. "Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser" he 
quips. His boss is about to give him the axe. His marriage to Carolyn 
(Annette Bening), a real estate agent, is just for show. His daughter, 
Jane (Thora Birch) is experiencing more that just the typical teenage 
resentment of her father, as she rightfully points out to him "You've 
barely even spoken to me for months."
Lester's answer is to make a drastic change in his lifestyle. He 
blackmails his boss out of nearly $60,000, buys the car that he has 
always wanted, develops a secret crush on his daughter's best friend, 
starts smoking dope, and gets a job that he truly enjoys: flipping 
burgers at a fast food restaurant.
Before long, Jane takes a liking to her new neighbor and classmate, 
Ricky (Wes Bentley), whose quiet and deeply observant habits test the 
attention span of Angela Hayes, Jane's best friend. As Jane and Ricky 
develop into a couple, Angela fades away into a world of infinite 
loneliness.
The role of Lester Burnham is an extraordinarily tough one. It exhibits 
feelings of pedophilia, obsession, and carelessness; just to name a few. 
Kevin Spacey does it all, thus creating a believable character and 
delivering an amazing performance that is one of the finest in memory. 
Annette Bening and the rest of the cast all do a sound job and play 
their parts credibly.
The title of the film is equally as thought provoking as its subjects. 
Is "American Beauty" a reference to the rose garden which Carolyn 
cherishes? Could it be Angela Hayes, the blond haired and blue eyed 
cheerleader that lives in constant fear or being ordinary? Most likely 
it is a reference to what director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball are 
trying to show is the impossible dream.
Two types of people will see this movie. One will see it as a humorous, 
out-of-the-ordinary sitcom. For them it is entertainment worth the price 
of admission. The other group will not only see those qualities, but the 
deep symbolic themes that lie between the lines. For them the two-hours 
will be priceless.

Mac VerStandig's radio review of the film will air on WTPN-Radio on
April 21, 2000---
Love and Basketball is a mawkish, overly-poignant and clichéd movie that
mindlessly bounces along without ever making a clear statement. For the
majority of the two-hour running time, the latter half of the title watches
from the bench as the picture makes a faulty bounce-pass at romance and
family values in the court of life. At the end, the viewing experience is no
more pleasurable and just as frustrating as rooting for the
destined-to-be-annihilated-opponent at a Harlem Globetrotters game.
As the `first quarter' (the movie voluntarily divides itself into four
quarters that are as even in length as Muggsy Bogues and Gheorghe Muresan
are in height) begins, we meet Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan), the new girl on
the block who is as much a tomboy as her older sister is a beauty queen. She
aspires to be the first woman in the NBA and will, ultimately, have a career
in basketball. But first she needs to overcome the preconceived notion,
which her mother happily lives, of a woman belonging in a kitchen  not on
the basketball court.
Before long, Monica is accepted in the neighborhood and befriends her next
door neighbor, Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), who also aspires to NBA greatness.
But for Quincy, the road is much more inviting with the aid of a father who
is already playing in the league that so many youth dream of joining. As the
two grow up together, their romance fades in and out with their destiny of
belonging with each other being painfully obvious to everyone but the two
aspiring athletes. Such relationships have grown tired on screen thanks to
other abysmal films like Drive Me Crazy and Whatever it Takes and this duo
do little to wake up the device.
As the quarters go on, the two children's personalities change possession.
Monica ceases to be the over-aggressive, tempestuous tomboy that she was and
finds a happy medium in life while Quincy turns away from the romantic,
understanding traits he had grown up with and allows his ego to take over.
There is little surprise when such turns take place as it can be expected
that any athlete who turns pro in the movies (Quincy enters the draft after
just one year of College) will develop such self-importance and any person
who struggles to find acceptance (Monica doesn't break the gender barrier in
the NBA), becomes humbled and wise overnight.
As the two become young adults, they round out their clichéd lives with
family conflicts. Monica struggles with her mother who prefers to see her in
a dress and pearls than a jersey and headband while Quincy is forced to deal
with his father's unbiblical behavior with a female fan. These excess
subplots do little to move the film through its two hours and could be as
easily disposed of as Michael Jordan's baseball career.
The one place where the film does score points, sometimes at least, is in
the game of morals. Writer/director Gina Prince does her predominately
teenage audience a favor in showing the young couple use a condom when they
first engage in intercourse. There is also a minor emphasis put on the
importance of education although it may well be too little to late to have a
real impact. Still, better some positive traits then none.
As you have probably gathered, the game of basketball takes a back seat to
the game of life in Love and Basketball. Although I applaud the film for not
feeling the need to use a dramatic last-minute buzzer-beater, something that
too many films these days overuse, I find it ironic that this movie might
well be one of the few that could benefit from such action.

Title
Review for WADD: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes (1998)
WADD: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes is an extremely
entertaining documentary that handles its 110 minutes without the
slightest hint of boredom. The film, by Cass Paley, has been making
its way around film festivals for several months now, and most
recently played the Florida Film Festival. The production is well
conceived probably due to an interesting motivation behind it. Similar
to the 1997 film, Boogie Nights, the story being related is an
intriguing one that constantly begs the question "What will happen
next?"
John C. Holmes was a small town boy that went on to become the first
major male pornographic star in the United States of America. As his
career advanced he became a constant substance abuser, a pathological
liar, and a household name all at the same time. Seeing his first
marriage end in divorce, Holmes married again and carried on numerous
affairs. He also became increasingly involved with crime. By his death
in the late 1980's, Holmes was living more of a soap opera than an
ordinary life. In WADD, the people closest to John, notably absent his
family, recall their experiences with the sex star. Director Cass
Paley regrets the absence of Holmes' family, but explains "I didn't
find any of John's family that would talk to us. His mother didn't
want to discuss it, his brother hung up on us." This has an adverse
impact on the film, but the presence of Holmes' wives and closer
friends almost entirely make up for his biological family's absence.
After seeing Boogie Nights, a film largely based on John C. Holmes,
Cass Paley decided to make this film. "[Boogie Nights] was interesting
film, I enjoyed it; but knew that a lot of what was there was
fantasized." Mr.  Paley explained. Going on, he said that he met the
pornography star once and "85having heard a lot of stories about John,
I wanted to know if these = were really true." So when Bill Amerson,
John's manager finally agreed, the film was set to be made. "And all
of the sudden one day I got a phone call and it was Bill and his voice
at the other of the phone goes 'it's time' and that's all that he
said." Mr. Paley enthusiastically recollects.
Several of the scenes in WADD are easily recognizable from Boogie
Nights. One such scene pits Holmes and his director Bob Chinn being
interviewed together.  After Holmes explains at length that he enjoys
working with Chinn because he is allowed to block his own sex scenes,
the director flat out denies the entire practice. This brings a
certain comedic light to the film that is a pleasant surprise, yet
makes a point about Holmes' less than honest nature as well.
WADD does include several clips from Holmes' movies. However, this is
a far cry from pornography and would be considered family material if
compared to Hollywood films like 8MM. "You can show it until you are
blue in the face, but I don't think the audience needs to see it."
Says Mr. Paley explaining the absence of hardcore nudity in his film.
One of the more interesting filmmaking techniques was showing a
contrast in people's opinion of Holmes by putting contradictory
remarks after each other.  Take for instance when several people
attest to how easy it was to work with him, the film immediately cuts
to another person's complaints about working with the star. This is
entertaining and interesting initially, but the concept loses its
charm after a while and becomes somewhat of a repetitive downside.
At the South by South West Film Festival, WADD won top honors for a
documentary feature. Reportedly the film has been received quite well
elsewhere. This trend should continue, as WADD is a well assembled and
intriguing examination of not just the man who practically founded
cinematic adult entertainment, but the industry he started as well.

Review for First of May, The (2000)
***Note: Given the excellence of this film, I have added it to the 
Moviereviews.org top 100 list at the #82 position.***
***Note: As of June 20, 1999 no studio had purchased the film for 
distribution and therefor no release date has been set.***
Paul Sirmons' directorial debut is entitled "The First of May", a term 
that the film explains is given to youngsters in circus life who have 
unlimited potential before them. With beautiful sentiment, all the 
traits of a great family film, loveable acting, and a story able to 
bring nearly anyone to tears, The First of May is a film as rich and 
capable as the youngster its name describes, as well as being one of the 
most heartwarming movies in recent memory.
Cory (Dan Byrd) is an 11 year old foster child who has been in numerous 
homes and shelters. Cory's latest set of parents are Dan (Tom Nowicki) 
and Michelle (Robin O'Dell), a happily married young couple with a 
bright future in front of them.
Early in the film Cory becomes friends with Carlotta (Julie Harris), an 
elderly lady who constantly complains about the prison like atmosphere 
that her nursing home provides. A former world traveler, she is both 
knowledgeable and sweet to the young child.
When Cory learns of plans that will place him in yet another home, he 
and Carlotta choose to runaway from the lives that constantly distress 
them. During this nearly magical journey that they take, Corey matures. 
He not only masters the ordinary grade school material that kids his age 
are mandated to learn, but he encounters lessons in business, love, and 
survival as well.
Most important during Cory and Carlotta's journey is the young boy's 
discovery of various forms of affection and love. Not only does Carlotta 
become the stable caretaker that he has dreamed of, but he becomes the 
grandchild that she has always wanted. Additionally, he forms bonds with 
a turtle named Mr. T, a beautiful and talented young girl, and the 
numerous people that he encounters, who soon become the family he has 
always desired. But by far, the most touching and heartwarming moment of 
Cory's journey is when he receives batting advice from a certain 
baseball legend named DiMaggio. This spectacular scene is most memorable 
because unlike typical cameo appearances by stars playing themselves, 
Cory's lack of knowledge regarding DiMaggio's identity transforms 
the greatest baseball player ever into an ordinary guy.
Furthering its heartwarming quality is The First of May's ability to 
call itself a family film. This production is absolute proof that any 
and all ages can be entertained without violence, sex, or even naughty 
language. Older generations will be grinning at the numerous references 
to the great New York Yankees dynasty, and the aforementioned scene with 
DiMaggio. Younger crowds should be well amused by some circus atmosphere 
stunts that can only be described as "neat." And just about everyone 
should enjoy the film's ability to move swiftly through the nearly two 
hours, and always have an interesting focus on screen.
If the plot, themes, and entertaining qualities of The First of May make 
it a tasty film, then the acting is a cherry on top. Newcomer Dan Byrd 
is presented with one of the toughest roles that an actor could be 
given. Not only is he the protagonist of a film, but he must play 
opposite Hollywood great Julie Harris in nearly every scene. Byrd and 
Harris both turn in performances that make their characters so sweet 
that audiences will lovingly "awe" and cry at times. The pinnacle of 
this occurs early in the film when the two are sitting in a tree 
together, and form a bond literally as strong as that of a loving 
family.
Holden Caulfield had what he considered to be a "lousy childhood." 
Oliver was an orphan. Over time writing and filmmaking have introduced 
the world to some of the most intriguing, entertaining, and occasionally 
adorable children with blemished histories. Cory is certainly one of 
these great characters. Through a loveable script, memorable moments, 
and touching acting, The First of May is a heartwarming family film.

Title
Review for Varsity Blues (1999)
Varsity Blues is neither a good film nor a bad one, but rather a 
mediocre production that had the potential to be far better, but could 
have slipped even lower as well. In some areas it was masterful, and 
other were equivalently pathetic to put it frankly. The outcome is 
interesting, odd and unique, but not necessarily worth the trip unless 
you are a teenage James Van Der Beek heartthrob or have some other 
obsession with one of the cult aspects of this film.
In a small town in Texas high school football is a way of life. It is 
the heritage, it is the society, and it is the community's favorite 
topic. Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) has coached the high school squad since 
his current team's parents were playing. Over that time he has brought 
home 2 state titles and 22 division titles. Grasped by immortality, he 
can do no wrong.
Leading this year's squad is quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) and 
lineman Billy Bob, (Ron Lester) who, as you can figure out early on, is 
a stereotype right out of a Jeff Foxworthy book. Then, as only Hollywood 
would have it, through corruption, illegal drinking, and a whole lot of 
other stuff that ATF doesn't like, Billy Bob misses a block and Lance 
goes down. Of course, this is where our hero enters. Jonathan Moxon 
seems about as perfect you can get, a scholarship to Brown, a great 
girlfriend, and a steady life. But all that must change when he becomes 
the starting quarterback of a football team that is a way of life.
Varsity Blues tries to explore several proven aspects of film making by 
putting them all together into one film. Parts of the film resemble such 
child favorites as Angels in the Outfield and others with a fairy tale 
plot and overly predictable ending. But much of the film is about sex, 
drinking, and life in strip bars; thus making it a far cry from kiddy 
material. I suppose the goal is to settle on a teenage audience 
somewhere in-between, but I have reservations as to just how anyone 
could sit through these 90 minutes of contrast and be truly entertained. 
One saving grace, however, is the acting. Jon Voight is absolutely 
stellar and offers a reminder to the world that he is one of the most 
underrated actors in Hollywood. In his freshman performance, James Van 
Der Beek is great as well. He seems to step beyond the typical teenage 
role and gives his part some meaning that few others could add to the 
film. And most of the supporting cast fairs well also, but nothing 
brilliant will come out of a bunch people playing drunk high school 
students.
Overall, this film does have it's moments of glory, but they are matched 
with shame. The plot isn't very original, but the combination of plots 
within is an unprecedented theory. However, I get the feeling that there 
is a good reason why no one had dared to do so before: it just doesn't 
work. So, although I tip my cap to the acting, I just don't see a 
quality film here.

Title
Review for Love & Sex (2000)
---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/love_and_sex.htm ---
---Mac VerStandig's coverage of the 2000 Florida Film Festival can be found
at http://www.moviereviews.org/florida_film_festival_2000.htm ---
`I know ten times more about blowjobs than I do about relationships' insists
Kate Welles (Famke Janssen) in the opening moments of `Love and Sex.' Over
the course of the next 75 minutes, Kate will experience one gigantic
epiphany consisting of numerous smaller realizations and will emerge, hardly
to the viewer's surprise, with a full grasp on the nature of relationships.
Yet, dull and predictable as such an inherently mawkish premise might sound,
the film is actually an oftentimes cute and humorous piece that should be
much easier for couples to cuddle up to than the recently similar `High
Fidelity.'
In Kate's life can be found shades of `American Beauty's' Lester Burnham
(Kevin Spacey). She works at a popular woman's magazine, is decidedly fed up
with her job and pens article after article that she recognizes to be phony.
Her boss is referred to as `the antichrist' and is preparing to fire Kate
over her current piece. The article in question, originally supposed to be a
commentary on the pleasures of oral sex, turned into a how-to on performing
effective fellatio; Kate refers to it as `a blow by blow' description.
However, unlike Lester's approach of trying to solve his problems at home
with each day being a new beginning, Kate decides to do like `High Fidelity'
s' protagonist, Rob (John Cusack), and first reconcile her romantic past.
The movie comes fully equipped with bite-size romantic philosophies like
`scheduled spontaneity is the key to long term love' and `we [fall in love]
for one reason: nothing in the world makes us feel better.' Such one-liners
do help the movie work on multiple levels and progress forward although you
can oftentimes tell that such hokey comments are the product of a
screenwriter who probably worked late nights.
The film seems to have no qualms allowing its characters to engage in some
very public displays of affection. Yet, the filmmakers seem inexplicably
scared to go `all the way' and instead opt for a very unsettling lack of
nudity. Films like this and `An Affair of Love' simply aggravate audiences
with continuous sexual lingo yet no genuine sexual content. If a movie's
purpose is to show the true nature of intimate relationships, which `Love
and Sex's' apparently is, then the reality of nudity should be welcomed, not
dismissed with such awkward tactics as the infamous `L' shaped covers which
reach just over a man's groin area yet extend over a woman's breasts.
Fortunately, the film's lead actress, Famke Jannsen, does have sex appeal.
She comes across as a blend of Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock with her
only noticeable physical flaw being a slightly too-long forehead. However,
most importantly, the young actress seems human and doesn't yet have the
jaded movie-star look that separates sex appeal from sex symbolism among
Hollywood's leading ladies.
At one point in the film, Kate and her primary boyfriend, Adam (Jon Favreau
who is a dead ringer for Jeremy Piven) argue over what to rent at a video
store. Kate favors a tear jerking foreign film while Adam endorses a movie
about topless ninjas. `Love and Sex' would be the perfect compromise.

*** A copy of this review can be found at 
http://moviereviews.org/deuce_bigalow_male_gigolo.htm ***
Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is a very pointed film that doesn't waste any 
time screwing around from the beginning by continuously firing shots at 
the handicapped, blind, tall, obese and Tourette's Syndrome inflicted, 
all to give the audience the pleasure they seek: morally reprehensible 
yet hilarious sexual humor. The production is also big where it counts: 
in the heart. This gigolo is well worth the $8 price of entry.
Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) has mastered his trait to a point where he 
swims with the fishes- literally. A knowledgeable yet sexually deprived 
fish tank cleaner, the highlight of Deuce's day is getting a sales girl 
to bend far enough over a water-filled tank that her white shirt becomes 
transparent. But he soon learns that Antoine Laconte's fish has 
developed a rare gill disorder. Aside from being one of Deuce's clients, 
Antoine is a male whore preparing to leave the country on business. Soon 
the title character is fish-sitting in a mansion and, predictably 
enough, finds himself having destroyed the $6000 mini-aquarium that he 
is supposed to be looking after. The race is on for him to buy a new one 
before Antoine returns home, and there is only one way he is going to 
come up with that much money that quickly: the same way Antoine does.
Rob Schneider is a member of the Saturday Night Live (SNL) class that 
produced stars like Adam Sandler (who produced this movie), Chris 
Farley, David Spade, Norm Macdonald (who has a cameo) and Mike Myers. Of 
the group, Schneider is most similar to Sandler with his ability to play 
an average (or below average for that matter) Joe who happens to be in 
the right (or wrong) place at the right (or wrong) time. Schneider also 
exhibits a Sandler-sized heart here when he falls in love with a 
"client" named Kate (Arija Bareikis). But Schneider is yet to peak, and 
if this movie isn't a hit you may never hear his name again, let alone 
with such prestigious company as the above.
So, just how far does this movie push the envelope sexually? Well, it 
makes the old SNL skit "Fred Gervan: Male Prostitute" seem tame and this 
summer's hit film American Pie seem like Deep Throat (not the Nixon 
informer). A police officer pulls down his pants numerous times and 
complains about his skinny member but no genitalia is ever shown and a 
pornographic film appears on television but only the sound is indicting. 
Deuce's adventures are relatively innocuous beyond some spanking and 
condom use, but you shouldn't forget that this is a movie about a 
gigolo. 
Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo will likely make a tidy profit from teens 
seeking its services on weekend nights. The movie needn't worry about 
getting rushed out of theatres as it will quickly go in video stores 
where a significant number of people will probably jerk it off the shelf 
and take it home for hours of private entertainment. Running at close to 
two hours, the film isn't too long to cause pain nor too short to not 
get the job done.

Review for American Pie (1999)
Note: For personal reasons, I will be on hiatus from June 30, 1999 until 
August 25, 1999. No reviews will be published during that time. -Mac
American Pie is a guilty pleasure at its best, and an outrage at its 
worst. The film is indisputably funny; due to a script filled with 
hilarious and memorable quotes, and the forthright use of sexual 
content. However, the same sexual aspects push the movie's R rating 
closer to "adults only" than the target teenage audience, and the often 
predictable nature of the work plays as a spoiler as well.
Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and 
Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have three weeks left in their high school 
careers and all face a probable realization of their worst nightmare: 
graduating a virgin. The last straw for them comes when their friend 
Sherman, long considered a semi-geek, announces his introduction into 
manhood. Realizing that prom will be their last chance in high school to 
achieve their goal, the four friends make a pact to help each other and 
get the job done, no matter what the cost.
Candidates for the group's goal include a choir girl named Heather (Mena 
Suvari); Kevin's long time girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid); Nadia (Shannon 
Elizabeth's), a foreign exchange student; and some assorted other 
females. The guys also have friend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne, who is 
fabulous) to help out and give advice when things get way too bazaar.
The funniest part of the production is a sub plot focusing on Jim in 
particular, his relationship with his Dad, and a certain act of 
disparity he commits involving an apple pie. But it is Jim giving a live 
broadcast over the internet that wins the funniest scene contest.
The MPAA issued American Pie an R rating. However, the film is more 
deserving of an NC-17 rating that the user friendly R mark. Some of the 
more offensive scenes include masturbation with a sock, a condom, and 
the aforementioned baked goods. The movie also highlights two premature 
ejaculations, some dirty magazines, oral sex, regular sex, nudity, 
mention of masturbation with a musical instrument, the consumption of 
male bodily fluid, and an entire plot focussing on sex. If this film 
doesn't merit an NC-17 mark, then the MPAA needs to start asking itself 
what does.
One thing American Pie is not lacking is memorable quotes and moments. 
As the four friends agree to make a pact to lose their virginity, the 
audience is treated to the most uproariously funny speech since John 
Belushi addressed the Delta fraternity in another Universal film, 
National Lampoon's Animal House. This memorable speech ends, of course, 
with "We will get laid!" And Natasha Lyonne has wonderful advice for her 
friend who wants to experience her first time in the perfect 
setting-"it's not a space-shuttle launch. It's sex!" And some of the 
greatest dating advice ever "Just ask 'em questions and listen to what 
they have to say and (explicative)."
Unfortunately, American Pie does have some predictable aspects. The 
production also has the dubious accomplishment of being a high school 
comedy with a plot that leads to the prom, something that has become 
nearly synonymous with 1999. Perhaps the most predictable "surprise" of 
the movie is the revelation of a certain character's prevarication that 
became central to the plot. But to the credit of the film, the four 
central character's fate is unknown until the film ends.  
American Pie opens with a scrambled video. It is obvious that the video 
is pornographic and a teenager is getting his "jollies" from it. 
Ironically there may be no better metaphor for the film itself. It is an 
entertaining work that seems to have gotten scrambled somewhere in the 
process, but teenagers will still enjoy every last moment, just as most 
older audiences will as well. 

Title
Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
---A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/man_on_the_moon.htm ---
---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.---
Man on the Moon is a brilliant movie that tells you absolutely nothing 
about its subject. At the end of two hours you are no closer to 
understanding what made Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) so zany, innovative or 
genius. Rather, you come away with a complete comprehension and 
subsequent newly found appreciation of the man's work.
"Hello, I am Andy and I would like to thank you for coming to my movie. 
I wish it was better" is the opening line of Man on the Moon. Soon you 
learn that Andy (Jim Carrey) wishes it was better because, once all the 
bologna was done away with, the movie is now finished. Credits role, you 
are instructed to go home and the screen goes black. Anyone that gets 
up, demands a refund or even thinks of heading for an exit at this 
juncture becomes the punch-line of the film's first joke, one that would 
make Mr. Kaufman proud. Soon Andy is back on screen and inviting you to 
at least attempt to understand his career by watching the biography that 
follows.
Kaufman's roots are the same as most comedians': at home, with family 
looking on. Years later Kaufman is bombing at an improvisational comedy 
club because, despite a radically different type of audience, his act 
hasn't changed from his days as a bedroom performer. Tapping his guitar 
and making funny sounds, Andy soon gets a clear message from the 
manager: get with it or get out. Andy returns with a dead-on Elvis 
impression that is definitely with it.
Like many stars, Kaufman is discovered in the aforementioned humble 
night club environment. Agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) doesn't take 
long to get his new client on Saturday Night Live and a little show 
called Taxi (for those of you still scratching your head as to exactly 
who this Kaufman guy was, he played Latka Gravas on the hit series whose 
cast returns to play themselves here, minus DeVito who is obviously 
occupied otherwise). Kaufman begins to perform in many different arenas 
with unheard of material. Whether it be wrestling women, disrupting a 
live TV show or taking the audience at Carnegie Hall out for milk and 
cookies; Kaufman ventures where few have previously gone and soars to 
the top in the process. But everything that goes up must come down.
Academy Award winning director Milos Forman helms this project with 
experience in both insanity and reality having also done One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus and The People Vs. Larry Flynt. Here is 
joined by screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who penned 
The People Vs. Larry Flynt (supporting actress Courtney Love, giving a 
delicious performance in a limited role here, is also an alumni from the 
pornographer's bio-pic). There is little doubt that Forman and the 
writers will be nominated for Academy Awards.
The other person who will likely be in The Shrine Auditorium on Oscar 
night is Jim Carrey. Once considered a funny-faced comedian doomed to a 
career of potty-mouth fart-fests, Carrey suddenly shows up here with one 
of the greatest dramatic performances of our time. Much like Robin 
Williams, Carrey's new trend (with the primarily dramatic The Truman 
Show in the not to distant past) seems to be playing funny people in 
serious movies.
Andy Kaufman probably died in 1984. Some people are of the opinion that 
he is still very much alive, and Man on the Moon actually provides a 
very nice "out-clause" should that ever prove to be true. Regardless, 
Kaufman's public recognition was at an all time low on May 16, 1984 and 
has hardly risen since. This film will likely project his name into 
household status once again, perhaps permanently.
Although Man on the Moon may not win battles at the box office or even 
on Oscar night, although it certainly deserves to, the movie will likely 
be one of only a handful from 1999 that is still fresh in minds several 
years down the road. Andy Kaufman aimed to give his audience an 
experience they would never forget, and Carrey and Forman do just that 
in Man on the Moon.
