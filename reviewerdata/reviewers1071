Title
Review for Mission: Impossible (1996)
Best Part:  Theme Music in Action Scenes - Old TV Show Music turned so-so 
chase scenes into spine-tingling fun.
Worst Part: Actress who played John Voight's wife.  1) Take diction lessons 
2)SPEAK UP!!!! 3) Women w/Big Lips went out with Kim Basinger.
Part that did work:  Having "MAX" be sophisticated older woman - What she 
lacks in youth she makes up in sex appeal - RUFF!!
Part that did not work:  Cool black dude who was a tough, rougue 
CIA....Computer Hacker?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Big Miss:  Movie That could have resurrected Emilo Estives' career,  but he 
dies in first 10 minutes.
Big Hit:  Another $100 million dollar movie, For Tom Cruise, Keeping him 
high on the A list.
