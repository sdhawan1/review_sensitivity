Title
Review for Joy Luck Club, The (1993)
        After watching the film THE JOY LUCK CLUB recently, I read some
        movie reviews, including the two stored in the
         FTP site.
        
        (See also .">http://www.msstate.edu/Movies>.)
        The reviews are almost all positive.  Newsweek (Sept 27, 1993)
        called it "a four-hankie classic".  Time (Sept 13, 1993),
        Variety and other magazines hailed it similarly.
(1) No yellowfaces: Asian actors are playing Asian roles.
(2) Stereotype: Asia is sexist, cruel, strange, exotic, and inscrutable.
(3) Stereotypes: Asian males are bad; white males are good.
(3.2) Asian males are all bad, whether in China or in the USA.
    --- Waverly's father.  The only thing he said was "Sit down. Eat."
(4) Comments on the plot of reunion between the mother and
        children deserted in China.
(4.1) Tyuugoku-zanryuu-koji (China-deserted-orphans)
(5) "Feminist" film or "Asian American experience" film?
(5.1) Stacy Ferguson  has written an
        excellent Usenet article questioning that "powerfully feminine
        starting point".  She argues that the film shows emotionally
        disturbed Asian mothers raising insecure daughters, and is not
        a good reflection of Asian women.
(5.2) A "feminist theme" film becomes weaker if it is flawed in other
        ways, such as by including racial stereotyping.  We (Steve Wei
        , etc) argue that this is the case in THE
        JOY LUCK CLUB.
