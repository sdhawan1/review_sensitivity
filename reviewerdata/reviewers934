Review for Solomon and Gaenor (1999)
If you're familiar with the name Shakespeare, the premise of Solomon and
Gaenor shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  It's got the whole doomed
romance equation (young man + young woman x secret love = tragedy), but
Gaenor is much more than a Romeo and Juliet rip-off.  It was nominated
for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar earlier this year, and it's
probably the first picture to have dialogue in Yiddish, Celtic and
English.
Abandoning Verona for 1911 Wales, Gaenor begins by introducing each of
the victims in the forthcoming romance.  Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, from
the upcoming 102 Dalmatians) is an Orthodox Jew whose family hails from
Russia.  They run a successful pawnshop, where Solomon keeps the books
and hits the town's streets with a pack full of fabric samples to woo
potential customers to the family store.
Along with her mom, Gaenor (Nia Roberts, in her acting debut) is
essentially a servant to her hard-working father and brother.  Both
burly men work at the coal mine, where Gaenor lost her boyfriend in an
explosion.  Like most of the inhabitants of this impoverished town, her
Gentile family spends most of their time either at church or thinking
about the next time they'll get to go to church.
When Gaenor opens the door to Solomon and his fabric, you can
practically see the sparks fly.  Utterly smitten, Solomon makes her a
lovely dress out of one particular material that Gaenor admired during
their first meeting.  When he goes back to present her with the dress,
the film almost captures an audible swoon coming from Gaenor, who
finally succumbs to her secret attraction to Solomon.
The kicker is that Solomon never lets on that he's a Jew.  In fact, he
covers it up, pretending to be an Englishman named Sam Livingstone in
order to pry Gaenor away from her overprotective family.  Gaenor's
parents seem pretty happy with `Sam,' but her big brother becomes
suspicious when he notices that Solomon's hands aren't covered in
calluses
The star-crossed lovers literally roll around in the hay but, like any
guy who's just gotten some, Solomon turns into a jealous, post-coital
jerk.  Gaenor expects him to marry her, but he knows matrimony would be
impossible if she learned the truth about his religion.  And before you
know it, Gaenor is blowing chunks during the morning chores.
If you have the slightest familiarity with storytelling, you know Gaenor
is headed somewhere dark and tragic.  First-time writer/director Paul
Morrisson keeps things even gloomier by setting the film in rainy,
overcast weather.  There's also a devastating scene where the pregnant
Gaenor is booted out of church after she's accused of having pre-marital
sex.  It was almost enough to make me want to start going to church
again.

Review for Fille sur le pont, La (1999)
A Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film earlier this year,
Girl on the Bridge is a terrific romantic tale about a young, suicidal
woman and a knife-thrower in the midst of a mid-life crisis.  Sure,
they're not your typical screen couple, but what would you expect from a
black-and-white French film about carnival act lovers?
Bridge opens with Adele (Vanessa Paradis) being interrogated by what
appears to be a panel of doctors.  We learn that the wide-eyed waif, who
has teeth like Alfred E. Newman, is 21 and dropped out of school early
to run off with a boy.  Since then, Adele has been unlucky in all
aspects of her life  especially love.  She even goes so far as to
compare herself to flypaper picking up filth.  This great scene is
comprised of just a few long shots of Adele, helping to establish her
character better than a typical film's opening scene.
The next scene shows Adele on a bridge over the Seine River in Paris.
She's about to jump into the cold, murky water below, when a stranger
emerges from the shadows, calmly telling Adele that she shouldn't off
herself.  The stranger even offers her a job as his assistant.
The stranger turns out to be a piss-poor knife-thrower named Gabor
(Daniel Auteuil, Lucie Aubrac).  He's just turned 40 and is starting to
worry that he's lost his touch with his precious knives.  To make
matters worse, Gabor is finding it increasingly difficult to get
bookings at big tent festivals, losing out to novelty acts like
contortionists and plate spinners.  But he sees something special in
Adele and readily takes the chance at making her a part of his act.
Gabor and Adele's first act involves knives being hurled at the shackled
beauty with a curtain separating the two.  Gabor has never thrown blind
before, but that's the only way he can talk his way past the
performance's pessimistic booker.  It goes off well, with Adele finding
some erotic pleasure from her fear of the oncoming knives.
The two hit the road, performing their sensational act around Europe.
The catch is that Gabor has to heighten the risk of each performance to
ensure a big payday.  He also has Adele visit various casinos, where the
woman who used to be so unlucky begins to rake in piles of money at the
roulette table.  The implication is that Gabor and Adele are unlucky
apart but unstoppable as a team  a point driven home by a trick
involving a dollar being torn in half and then, magically, becoming
whole again.
You can see the instant where their luck takes a dramatic turn for the
worse, at which point you hold your breath and wait for the inevitable
tragedy to occur.  But it doesn't come the way you might expect it to.
In fact, it's not even close.
While Paradis does an admirable job as Adele, Auteuil's Gabor is the
real draw here.  This has to be the coolest role in a French film since
Alain Delon played Le Samouraď.  Auteuil looks like the love child of
Midnight Run's Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin (I understand the scene
where he is conceived is on the recently released DVD of Run).  He's
definitely not the most attractive guy (even for France), and his face
barely shows any emotion, yet his performance is alluring and
believable.
Bridge was directed by Patrice Leconte (Ridicule) and written by Serge
Frydman.  Leconte's direction, along with Jean-Marie Dreujou's lush
cinematography, make the film feel more dreamlike than any in recent
memory.  The film was nominated for eight César Awards (the French
version of the Oscars), nabbing nods for picture, director, screenplay
and both lead acting roles (only Auteuil took home a trophy at a
ceremony ironically hosted by Delon).  Although the subtitles are often
difficult to read against the black-and-white pictures, Bridge plays
like a fairy tale for grown-ups.

Review for Ladies Man, The (2000)
It's almost become an annual rite of autumn - buy school supplies for
the kids, hunker down to watch the Major League Baseball playoffs, carve
a scary face into your Halloween pumpkin and sit through an awful film
based on a marginally entertaining skit from Saturday Night Live.
Potential viewers of these films break down into two equally disturbing
groups  those that watch SNL religiously and feel some bizarre
obligation to see each hastily produced film released by Lorne Michaels'
production company, and those that don't watch the show but want to see
the film because they've heard from co-workers that the skit is `pretty
funny.'  Each goes home disappointed, swearing that they'll never do it
again.  But come the following fall, they're right back in line to buy
tickets for the next skit-turned-film debacle.
The apparent purpose of these pictures is to have the main character(s)
repeat their catch phrase as many times as possible over a 90-minute
span.  It's a strange concept, considering that a skit needs to be
pretty popular to even be considered as feature film fodder.  If it's
popular, that means the catch phrase has already been rubbed into the
ground for a couple of years on the show, which should make regular
viewers cringe every time the phrase is uttered.
In The Ladies' Man, the phrase is `That sounds real good,' and it's
spoken by 70s throwback Leon Phelps (Tim Meadows), the host of a late,
late night radio call-in show in Chicago (it's a public access
television program on SNL, but who's keeping track?).  `The Ladies'
Man,' which logs oodles of complaints yet is supposedly popular, is a
show where listeners address questions about relationships to Leon, who
has a lisp as thick as his Afro and, reportedly, a mighty `wang.'  More
importantly, Leon (like Dr. Laura) is idiotic, unintelligent and
uneducated, offering his listeners bad advice that usually involves
`doin' it up da butt.'
In the absence of a typical plot, Man floats between two loosely
constructed threads.  One focuses on Leon trying to find a job after
he's fired from his radio station (a head-scratching move, considering
his show is so popular), while the second involves the relationship
between Leon and his seemingly normal producer (Karyn Parsons, The Fresh
Prince of Bel Air), who, for some reason, likes him and supports his
career.  Leon's only redeeming quality appears to be an authentic desire
to help people.  `I'm like Mother Teresa,' he explains, `but bonin'.'
Man features a subplot where the husbands and boyfriends of women that
Leon has bedded band together to hunt down the despicable cad.  The
group is called the VSA, and to explain the initials would deprive
potential viewers of the film's only legitimate laugh.  Among the VSA
members are Meadows' SNL castmate Will Ferrell and Lee Evans (There's
Something About Mary).
Man was directed by Reginald Hudlin (The Great White Hype) and
co-written by Meadows and two other debut scibes, Dennis McNicholas and
Andrew Steele.  The script abandons ideas like comic timing and, well,
common sense.  There are also cameos from the likes of Rocky Carroll
(Chicago Hope), Eugene Levy (Best in Show), former Kids in the Hall
stars Mark McKinney and Kevin McDonald and, strangest of all, recent
Oscar nominee Julianne Moore.  Billy Dee Williams also has a small role,
playing a bartender in a lounge that doesn't even serve Colt 45.  The
horror of it all.

Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Growing up as the child of dirty hippies, I was introduced to the plight
of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter at an early age.  Via the Bob Dylan song, I
learned that Carter was the number one contender for the middleweight
boxing title until he was accused, falsely tried and convicted of a
grisly triple murder by an all-white jury.  The song also detailed the
cover-ups, witness tampering and corruption ranging from the local
police to the judge that handed Carter his life sentence.  Pretty heavy
subject matter for a song (thank God that Dylan was writing in blank
verse), not to mention my five-year-old brain.  The tale seemed
inconceivable, even to a kid whose biggest concern was trying to get the
brake on his Big Wheel to make him spin to a groovy halt.
Still, I approached the film with apprehension.  First, you have to
consider the fact that you're basically seeing a movie that will offer
no surprises.  It's a biopic and, like Man on the Moon, based on
real-life events that most people already know.  Then there's director
Norman Jewison.  He's made some decent films, especially when he focuses
on racial injustice, but his last two (Bogus and Only You) really stunk
up the joint.  And then there's Denzel Washington (The Bone Collector),
an actor who, in my opinion, is one of the most overrated in the
business (it's a photo-finish with Liam Neeson).  But since The
Hurricane has already been praised by critics worldwide, I felt I should
probably check my preconceptions at the box office window.
Hurricane is a good film.  Is it a Best Picture candidate?  Absolutely
not.  Does it belong on Top Ten lists?  Not unless you've only seen two
dozen movies in 1999.  I'm not even sure that you can call the film
entertaining, considering the depressing material and lack of
surprises.  It is simply a good film.
Among its strengths is the way the film is assembled.  Instead of going
for the simple, linear, timeline approach, Jewison skips from Carter's
welterweight title fight in 1963; to the release of his novel, `The 16th
Round,' in 1973; to the murders in 1966; to Carter's youth in Patterson,
New Jersey; to the `present day,' when a group of Canadians lead a fight
to free the imprisoned boxer.  Jewison is able to pull this off without
Hurricane seeming too jumpy or confusing.
Also commendable is Roger Deakins' (The Big Lebowski) cinematography,
which is fantastic without being intrusive.  His camera-work, especially
during the grainy black-and-white fight, is quite remarkable.  At this
point in post-Raging Bull cinema, it's almost a requirement that all
fight scenes be filmed in black-and-white, but Deakins does more than
just use black-and-white stock:  He gives these scenes such a dated look
that you can almost hear Howard Cosell calling the action.
But the biggest surprise of all is Washington, who does a really great
job in the titular role.  The usually one-dimensional actor manages to
appear angry, scared and delusional at the same time.  There is one
standout scene where he meets with his lawyers and they do that whole
talking-on-the-phone-separated-by-a-thick-pane-of-glass thing.
Washington gets so worked up that his side of the glass starts to get
steamed up.  Or maybe he just had really bad gas.
Hurricane certainly isn't without flaws, though.  It's one slow-moving
train, punctuated by a tedious scene of Carter in `the hole.'  It feels
like we're watching the entire ninety-day ordeal play out in real time.
I also have a big problem with the creation of the fictional character
Detective Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya, Dick).  The detective is
portrayed as a bigot that sat around and dreamed up ways to incarcerate
Carter.  Sound familiar?  It should - it's the O.J. defense.  While I
understand his inclusion intends to illustrate the corruption of the
system, it's really hard to swallow.  I'm sure that law enforcement
officers wish they had this kind of free time on their hands.  The
character does nothing but potentially incite hatred toward police.  And
that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Review for Aimée & Jaguar (1999)
Think it was tough being a Jew in Germany during World War II?  Try
being a lesbian Jew.  That's the basic theme in Max Färberböck's Aimée &
Jaguar, a Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film earlier
this year.  As in The Tao of Steve, there isn't anybody named Aimée or
Jaguar in the film  they're pen names used by two women having an
illicit affair amidst the almost constant bombing of Berlin.
Felice Schragenheim (Maria Schrader) spends her days working for a
pro-Nazi newspaper in order to give important information to the Jewish
underground, while her evenings are spent with a close-knit group of
fellow lesbians.  Felice is a confrontational smart-ass who isn't afraid
to push the envelope when it comes to her sexuality or her religious
beliefs, causing a friend to say that she's `lost all sense of danger.'
In fact, the only time Felice seems uncomfortable is when her
grandmother prods her about an imaginary fiancé.
When Aimée opens, we see Felice at an orchestral concert with her pal,
Ilse (Johanna Wokalek).  Ilse works for Lilly Wust (Juliane Köhler), the
beautiful, bourgeois wife of a Nazi soldier.  Before the concert is
interrupted by the city's air raid sirens, Felice longingly gazes at the
seemingly unobtainable Lilly from afar.  She decides to write Lilly a
steamy love letter, anonymously signed `Jaguar,' which Lilly assumes is
from one of the men she sees while her husband fights in Eastern
Europe.  Through Ilse, the two women meet and begin to spend more and
more time together, ultimately beginning a torrid affair.
But Lilly still doesn't know that Felice and her friends are Jewish; she
just assumes they're banded together because of their alternate
lifestyle.  The first sexual encounter between Felice and Lilly is quite
breathtaking.  Färberböck does a great job at capturing Lilly's first
nervous foray into lesbianism, as well as Felice's cautiousness at
becoming involved in a potentially dangerous relationship.
Aimée also succeeds in its portrayal of 1943 Berlin.  People think
nothing of greeting each other with a friendly `Heil Hitler.'  There is
also an interesting scene where an affluent woman sells food stamps to
Felice and her gal pals in the bathroom of a posh club.  `Exciting
times, aren't they?' she snidely asks the women after charging too much
money.
In addition to the Golden Globe nomination, Aimée also won the top
acting prize (shared by the two leading ladies) at the Berlin
International Film Festival, which, ironically, is where the film is
set.  The film was written by Färberböck and Rona Munro (Ken Loach's
Ladybird Ladybird), who based their script on the Erica Fischer novel.

Review for Pay It Forward (2000)
What do an alcoholic titty-bar waitress, an obsessive-compulsive 7th
grade teacher and a kid with beady little eyes and giant teeth have to
do with each other?  You can find out in Pay it Forward, a
button-pushing film with terrific acting, an interesting story and a
really hokey ending.
Forward begins with a Los Angeles news reporter named Chris Chandler
(Jay Mohr, Action) getting his classic car ruined during a hostage
situation.  While he stares in disbelief at the twisted pile of metal, a
complete stranger offers Chandler a brand-new Jaguar.  Shocked beyond
belief, Chandler asks the stranger if any strings are attached to the
generous, out-of-the-blue offer, to which the stranger replies, `Pay it
forward.'  The understandably curious reporter then launches an
investigation into the situation.
Flash to four months earlier, where 11-year-old Trevor McKinney (Haley
Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense) is beginning his first year at a Las Vegas
middle school.  His social studies teacher, Mr. Eugene Simonet (Kevin
Spacey, The Big Kahuna), gives Trevor and his class an abstract
extra-credit assignment by telling them to `think of an idea to change
our world and put it into action.'
The strong-minded Trevor immediately begins to work on the project,
coming up with a rather simple, inventive idea of thinking globally but
acting locally.  His plan - dubbed `paying it back' - has three steps
(like The Tao of Steve) that basically calls for everybody to help three
other people in unique ways.  In turn, these people will help three more
people, who will help three more people, and so on and so forth, until
the whole world becomes one cosmic pyramid scheme of do-gooders.
The main problem with Forward is that Trevor concocts this idea within
the first 30 minutes of the film, so you know that Chandler will
eventually trace `pay it forward' back to Trevor before the credits
start to roll.  The remaining ninety-plus-minutes are rather
predictable, save a couple of minor twists at the end.  But it's still
fun to watch Trevor's plan take root, especially when it shows you can
go from providing a bowl of cereal to giving away a luxury vehicle in
just five simple steps.
After Trevor's first attempt to help a homeless man (James Caviezel,
Frequency), he sets his sights on Mr. Simonet, a slightly disfigured
burn victim who doesn't appear to have had a date since the Carter
administration.  Trevor tries to fix his unsuspecting teacher up with
his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt, As Good As it Gets), a boozehound with
half-empty bottles stashed all over the house.  At first, it seems like
all of Trevor's attempts at helping others fail miserably, but the
presence of the Chandler sub-plot reminds us that at least one must have
been successful.
It's interesting to watch people get suspicious and angrily shout, `I
didn't ask for your help,' when strangers offer to go out on a limb.
Forward also shows people `paying it forward' on a broader level through
corrective parenting.
If you think it sounds schmaltzy, just wait until the ending, which
drives its point home with the weepy Jane Siberry song "Calling All
Angels."  It's calculating beyond comprehension.  Forward has other
problems, too.  The sole black character is a convicted thief, while the
only two Latinos are knife-wielding pre-teens.  Jon Bon Jovi (U-571),
who plays Trevor's deadbeat dad, looks strangely effeminate and could
probably pass for a transvestite on the right street corner.
There's also a big stumbling block with the Chris Chandler thread of the
story.  Why does he start tracing the origins of `pay it forward'?  It's
just dumb luck that he catches the thing while its only five steps
removed from the source.  He could have been hundreds of participants
away, and his search could have taken years.  Forward's time
manipulation is a little shaky as well.  Chandler's story begins four
months after Trevor launches `pay it forward,' but by the last reel, the
past has somehow caught up with the present.
Forward was directed by Mimi Leder, who is probably best known for
helming action films (like Deep Impact and The Peacemaker) and is a
frequent contributor to the fast-paced ER.  The deliberately slow pacing
of Forward comes as somewhat of a welcome change, as are the close-ups
of Mr. Simonet's scars and Arlene's prematurely aged mug.  The film was
written by Leslie Dixon (The Thomas Crown Affair) and adapted from the
Catherine Ryan Hyde novel.  But don't let the fact that the film was
written and directed by women give you the impression that Forward is a
chick flick.
Oscar-caliber talent can be found behind the camera as well as in front
of it.  Thomas Newman (a nominee for American Beauty) provides the
score, while David Rosenbloom (a nominee for The Insider) serves as the
film's editor. Cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, who was robbed of a
nomination for The Cider House Rules, does a fantastic job of making the
characters seem extremely isolated from the rest of the world,
especially with scenes looking out Mr. Simonet's classroom over the
barren desert and Rocky Mountains.
