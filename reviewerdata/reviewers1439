Review for Great Expectations (1998)
Great Expectations (star)(star)(star)
Starring Ethan Hawke (Finnegan Bell), Gwyneth Paltrow (Estella),
Hank Azaria (Walter Plane), Chris Cooper (Joe), Anne Bancroft
(Ms. Dinsmoor), Robert De Niro (Lustig)
Think of it as Great Expectations for the MTV generation. You wonšt need
your Cliffšs notes for this one; itšs much easier to follow whatšs going
on because itšs shorter and simpler. And thatšs not always a bad thing.
Frankly, I didnšt mind the movie being set in the 20th century. And I
didnšt mind some of the liberties. But I honestly minded two things. I
minded a movie made about a novel I donšt really like. And I minded a
movie that was afraid to get involved with its own story, despite some
merciful editing and shortening of the original. 
I have to reveal my prejudices up front. Dickens is not one of my favorite
authors. His work, to put it bluntly, has always seemed sentimental and
kitschy, and I know I am not alone in this opinion. So I canšt decide if
this story of his is really worth doing in its entirety, if at all. This
movie tries for a hip, rock-and-roll, MTV kind of Dickens, though I donšt
know if MTV and Dickens mix. Kind of like spraypainting paisleys on the
side of a subway train. 
So to make the movie move, its creators jazzed it up and shortened it.
Considerably. Mercifully (it is a 400 plus page novel). True to life, or
at least Hollywoodšs version of life, the movie trims much of the fat from
Dickensšs novel and leaves us with only the essentials: the boy, the girl,
Joe and his shrewish wife (Pips, or in this case Finnšs, sister), the
convict, the old woman, and Pipšs/Finnšs rival lover. 
But when the movie eliminates what was bad or insufferable about the book
it also gets rid of some of what was good. Take for instance the minor
characters. Every Dickens novel is full of minor, colorful characters.
They make (and break) his novels. They usually have more personality than
his main character(s), although most are mere caricatures. The following
minor characters are shrunk or cut entirely from the movie: the lawyer
(almost a cameo in the movie), his assistant (missing), Pipšs boyhood and
later young adulthood friend (missing), the woman who works for the lawyer
(missing), and any action in court (missing). 
So even though the movie makes the story watchable within a two hour time
frame, its brevity makes it almost casual. Gone are the attachments we
form to the loveable, motley cast of characters of the book. Whatšs left
is sort of like a short, modern fairy tale. All in all, itšs not bad.  It
is beautifully shot (like any good music video is) and well acted, despite
occasional intrusions of unkempt  rock music and some bad makeup on
DeNirošs Lustig in the third act. 
But I left feeling not quite satiated. Which, ironically, is the way
Pip/Finn is supposed to feel after getting (almost) everything he really
wants. But that is supposed to be him, not us feeling that way. When we
see an allegedly great romance arenšt we supposed to be touched? To take
the heat off the movie, I again think that some of the fault is in
Dickensšs story.  For a novel so long, it just was just too trivial, not
łgreat˛ enough. With expectations like these top draw from, the film is
sort of doomed from the start.
Not much is embellished or added, except Finnšs new life and the
perfunctory but very tastefully done, (as with nudity elsewhere in the
movie) sex scene. (I hope doesnšt spoil the movie for anyone, but you knew
they were going to get into bed sometime during the show.) 
I grudgingly recommend the movie, which is short enough and entertaining
enough for the younger set so they wonšt get bored, but not quite long
enough or touching enough for the more mature crowd, who may leave the
theatre wondering if they missed something more than just the minor
characters. I wondered what the movie might have been like had its
creators trusted in the (admittedly flawed but lengthy) story. I guess
wešll never know. Again, maybe it canšt be done, given what there is to
work with. So we may have Hollywood marketing men to thank for the
sculpting of this move. These are the guys who tell studio execs that the
demographics of moviegoers are weighted heavily in the 18 to 25 age group,
and this was one movie that certainly wasnšt taking ANY chances taxing
their attention span.

Review for Titanic (1997)
Written and directed by James Cameron
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt
Bukater), Billy Zane (Cal Hockley), Kathy Bates (Molly Brown), Frances
Fisher (Ruth DeWitt Bukater)
Titanic: Small, Thoughtful Hollywood Movies Goes Down with the Ship
In his book Adventures in Screen Trade, William Goldman identifies two
types of movies: real, and comic book. Long before the end of my review
you will guess which one I think Titanic is. 
I initially didnšt want to see the Titanic. I figured I knew what was
going to happen, so why bother?  And I had heard stories about how it was
three hours long, and that you had better go to the bathroom first, etc.
Eventually I was forced to give in and this review is the result. 
Since so much has been said about the moviešs plot, I will confine my
comments to my immediate reactions. First, I liked the movie more than I
thought I would. Second, it didnšt seem as long as it was, so it certainly
held my attention. But third, although I liked the movie, the longer it
has been since seeing it, the more disappointed I am because of its little
flaws. 
First, the story of the young, star-crossed couple (you knew they were
star-crossed because they fell in love on a boat that you knew would sink)
was not entirely believable, although there was enough energy there to
draw you into the show. That this love story works in spite itself is less
a testament to the script or the casting, both of which were flawed, than
to the power of a good old fashioned love story. Leonard DiCaprio (Jack
Dawson) looked too young, and Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt) too old. His
dialogue was filled with anachronisms and had a modern day smart-aleck
sound, and even though there was some chemistry between the two, their
union seemed improbable. I found it hard to believe, for instance, that
after her motheršs plea to stick with the rich fiance Cal Hockley (played
by Billy Zane), Winsletšs character would abandon her family and go after
a penniless young boy. Chase your own dreams to your own detriment if you
will, but abandon dear old mom to creditors? Only in storybook romances
are rich girls that impractical and willing to abandon their parents.
Also, casting an older-looking MAN (versus boy) than DiCaprio might have
helped their relationshipšs credibility. As I watched the movie I found
myself wondering whether the formula story book romance between social
unequals may be getting a bit hackneyed for our post-modern sensibilities.
Then there is the old woman. She is allegedly the young woman eighty or so
years later. For some reason her character irked me. Perhaps itšs because
she wasnšt a character but a plot contrivance. She didnšt look 100 plus
years old or enough like I would imagine Kate Winslet would look like as
an old crone. And I couldnšt see how she could have lived this long and
not have told anyone this incredible story. Add to that her possession of
a pricless diamond necklace, which she even wore around her neck while
doing the gardening, that no one knew about? At times, these and other
features of Titanicšs story book plot kept nudging me to remind me that it
was just there to make the rest of the disaster a little more palatable.
And that was another problem too, the jarring juxtaposition of dime store
romance novel plot with real life tragedy. The sinking of the Titanic was
a real disaster, an historical event with all sorts of amazing
coincidences and instances of both sacrifice and utter selfishness, and
most of that went ignored so that a plot that would have barely sustained
a made for TV movie could take center stage. Without the magnificent
special effects (mostly magnificent, occassionally you could tell that the
people walking on deck in the long shots were computer generated), would
this be a movie? Which leads me to summarize what both these flaws
signify: that the plot and character were secondary to the spectacle. And
a comic book movie is nothing if not a great spectacle.
This raises a disturbing question: Are we still able to make and watch
movies that arenšt comic book? There are still a few of them made, but
their numbers seem always to be in decline. Special effects are here to
stay, in part because people expect them, but also because they allow film
makers to get away with contrived plot and shallow characters. (Consider
how flat and comic book-like both the Jurassic Park moviesš characters
are.) And now that movies are made on a scale so large that most have to
succeed in foreign markets in order to turn a profit, the comic book movie
is easier to translate and export, with its easily distinguishable good
and bad guys and its shorter more declarative sentences played atop an
obvious spectacle.
Of course, few people notice the decline of the small movie anymore
because most of us have been weaned on a diet of flat, convenient
characters in movies and tv. In the end, the Titanic will make a lot of
money and inspire a few fond memories, but little more. It is not a movie
that we can revisit to mine for hidden meaning or allegory. Thatšs a sad
memorial for a disaster that needlessly claimed the lives of so many
innocent victims. But at $200 million, you canšt risk making a
sophisticated movie since you need half the population of the US to watch
it just to break even. Such is the legacy of the Hollywood blockbuster,
starting with Jaws and Star Wars through the Jurassic movies and down to
Titanic, that the studios, greedy for the outrageous profits to be had
from them, all want a blockbuster of their own. The small, thoughtful
Hollywood movie, once almost extinct but making a slow comeback, may at
last have been dealt a final death blow. We now hear that Titanic may now
be the only movie to gross over a $billion worldwide. The Titanic took
down with it more than its 1500 plus brave souls.
Again, donšt get me wrong, this is a movie I enjoyed, but as soon as it
was over, I had a nagging sensation of not quite being satisfied, a
sensation I have sadly gotten used to. As I walked to my car after
watching the Titanic, I thought I could hear a bell tolling.  It wasnšt
tolling for the brave dead from the Titanic, but for a new casualty, the
small, serious Hollywood movie. I got in and drove away as fast as I
could, hoping to avoid the funeral.

Review for Tango Lesson, The (1997)
Review: The Tango Lesson (star) (star) (star)
Sally Potter (herself) and Pablo Veron (himself)
Near the beginning of The Tango Lesson, Sally Potter asks tango master
Pablo Veron why he chose to dance the tango: łI didnšt choose the tango;
the tango chose me.˛ Of course it did, Pablo. During that split-second
pause after his first sentence I knew what his second phrase would be,
about being chosen, and I knew that this film would not surprise me, but
it would be pleasing. The Tango Lesson is a delightful film, but mostly
because it is filled with beauty, beautiful dances, beautiful moments, and
beautiful people, especially Pablo and his first partner (unfortunately
NOT Sally). But a profound revelation The Tango Lesson is not. Some of the
moments, like the one above, contained predictable dialogue, and I found
myself marvelling at things I donšt think I was supposed to marvel at.
Like what a magnificent dancer Sally Potter is, she does all her own
dancing, and how everyone who lives in Paris seems to be able to speak at
least three languages. I left the movie, less enthralled by the
romantic/man/woman story than by the magical lifestyle that Parisians,
especially independent movie makers, seem to lead. I kept wondering if
someone like Pablo Veron really can make a living putting on stage shows
where the entire show is a series of couples soloing a tango number
onstage. Only in Paris, I thought. Remember, for those of you who are
provincial American suburbanites like myself, France is a country where
they rate intellectuals like Americans rate college football teams. They
really are different than us. 
I think I was supposed to be captivated by the intrigue of the story--film
director meets and learns from tango dancer who later must follow her
direction in making a film--but I wasnšt. I think I was supposed to be
captivated by the love story that wasnšt a love story, but I wasnšt. I
wasnšt bored, but, as I said before, I kept being awed at some of the
wrong things. I was awed, and rightfully so, by the dancing. Pablo Veron
shines, and Ms. Potter is not far behind for someone whose profession is
film directing. And even though I still donšt want to learn the tango, I
marvelled at how beautiful dance is. There is a sort of religious, not
capital łR˛ religious, but cultural religious undertone to the film. Both
of the main characters are Jewish and it becomes a connecting point for
them. Again, I ended up marvelling less at their connection and more at
the cultural stereotype my mind kept trying to draw about Jews truly being
the chosen people. Everything the main characters did in the movie, aside
from a few awkward moments where Pablo remembered he was acting in a film,
seemed effortless, seamless, flawless, like a smooth tango. 
To be blunt, one of the reasons the filmšs emotional story line didnšt
hook me is because the story seemed contrived, less a reflection of what
happened between Sally and Pablo in real life and more a reflection of
what she wishes had happened (or didnšt happen). As a couple they danced
well together, but they lacked chemistry. Sally Potter just looked so much
older than he, and, Išm afraid, so much plainer. Her thin, drawn, elfin
face just didnšt make me think tango, even though I knew she was supposed
to be a film director first. Call me conventional, but I have to see some
obvious physical beauty and energy in a woman onscreen for me to think
that another man could fall in love with her. Even though this might have
been based on reality, I still had trouble believing he would be attracted
to her. 
As an aside, I just want to say that there are a couple of humorous
moments in the film. At an early point in the film she makes a trip to LA
to promote a bizarre script idea that she is seen working on in the filmšs
opening. The overdone poolside conversation is cliche but no doubt
reminiscent of some real life experiences the director herself must have
had trying to pitch aesthetic ideas to people who donšt even know what the
word means. 
See the film. Not because youšre going to appreciate the similarities
between filmmaking and tango dancing or the almost love story or the
needlessly weighty things Sally seems to be saying about the
creative/artistic process, but see the film because it is not like
anything youšre going to see in America for a good long while. And enjoy
the dancing. I did, and I caught myself smiling as I watched. A film
hasnšt done that to me in a long time.
