Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
American Beauty  Dir: Sam Mendes. Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening,
Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, Peter Gallagher and Chris Cooper.
The pitch: A man hobbled by a mid-life crisis and a nightmarish family
channels his depression into lust for a teen-age girl.
Yes, and there's so much more. A jet-black satire of suburbia, this
cautionary fable with a grim, inevitable climax features a stunning
performance from Spacey, as the 42-year-old advertising man who hates his
job and shrewish wife (Bening). Seldom does a film spew such venom, or offer
such a myopic and pessimistic worldview, only to shatter our expectations
with a glimmer of hope at the end. In terms of metaphor, as social
commentary and, yes, as art, American Beauty is the most challenging film of
1999, sure to prompt controversy and conversation. The constant, symbolic
use of the color red is enough to fuel many a late-night discussion, long
after the credits roll. Expect OscarŽ nominations for both actors,
first-time film director Mendes, for the incredible script by television
writer Alan Ball (Cybill) and certainly for the picture itself.
Let us be clear, so that no one goes into the theater unaware: American
Beauty is a difficult, provocative experience, a film concerned with ideas
that outwardly decent people don't discuss, though some no doubt ponder in
their hearts.
Watching his daughter's best friend Angela (Suvari) perform her cheerleading
routines, Spacey discovers a fire in his loins and a passion for life that
has been missing for two decades. When he sees Suvari strut, her arms
snaking over her lithe body, it's lust at first sight. But Spacey also feels
a renewed interest in life that has little to do with sex. Don't dismiss
this as just another Lolita tale, although it bears more than passing
resemblance to Nabokov's most famous novel. American Beauty is that rare
flower in American film  a major-studio (Dreamworks) production with A-list
stars tackling material that many daredevil independents might hesitate to
touch. The picture works the same territory as Todd Solondz's repugnant film
Happiness, except here the characters are treated with compassion and a
degree of humanity in spite of their weaknesses.
As the film opens, we learn Spacey's character is already dead. He narrates
in flashback, a technique reminiscent of Sunset Boulevard. And it works.
Discovering how Spacey will die is critical to the suspense of the
heartbreaking final reel. Spacey explains his fall and ultimate redemption
in the cynical-comical narration that frames the film. In fact, he says it
all:
`In a year, I would be dead,' he says. `In a way, I already was.'
His character is a loser whose career is trapped in an office cubicle. His
wife, a real-estate saleswoman, and their teen-age daughter (Birch) despise
him for no reason other than he is socially awkward. Spacey doesn't even
seem to like himself, though he masturbates in the shower before work and
declares it will be `the highlight of my day.'
His wife would rather tend to her blood-red roses, framing the white-picket
fence around their well-appointed home. She is so obsessive-compulsive, so
driven in her pursuit of perfection, that her pruning shears are
color-coordinated with her clogs. She worries that Spacey might spill a beer
on her $4,000 silk upholstered sofa. Bening is mesmerizing in the role.
Spacey's daughter is embarrassed for him as he stumbles out the door,
spilling the papers in his briefcase on the sidewalk.
The man knows something is missing from his life. When he meets the teen-age
sexpot Angela, his brain begins to boil. He fantasizes encounters with the
girl, reclining on a bed of rose petals. He quits his job, extorts $60,000
from his hateful boss and buys a 1971 fireapple-red muscle car. American
Woman by the Guess Who blares on the stereo as he drives home. He wails
along with the anthem, closing his eyes and nodding in recognition when that
serpentine guitar solo kicks in (this movie deals brilliantly in subtext).
He starts working out with free weights in the garage, after he eavesdrops
on Angela telling his daughter that her dad would be hot if he had a little
more muscle tone.
At a business party, while his wife flirts with the local king of home sales
(a slick, silver-haired Gallagher), Spacey sneaks out of the noxious
gathering to smoke a joint in the alley with the waiter (Bentley), a strange
kid who's just moved in to Spacey's neighborhood. He's the creepy teen-ager
next door.
Bentley has his own obsessions. He videotapes Spacey's daughter from his
bedroom and slowly, shyly, begins an awkward romance with the troubled girl.
He also sells high-quality pot and hides this enterprise from his abusive,
homophobic ex-Marine father (Cooper). Bentley has to provide urine samples
to his brutal dad every six months, ever since he was busted for dealing.
His mother has been so brow-beaten by Cooper that she can only stare at the
wall and make apologies for a house that is already spotless. Bentley is a
brooding teen, biding his time for a chance to leave home. And although he
professes to love the beauty in the world, in
his piercing stare we sometimes catch a glimpse of Columbine madness.
Director Mendes propels these miserable characters on a collision course,
then casually introduces a gay couple who live down the street. Theirs is
the only enduring relationship in the film.
Their chance encounter with Spacey and later, with the baleful Cooper,
triggers a series of comic misunderstandings between the core characters.
The confusion escalates with frightening speed into violence and
mind-numbing tragedy on a thunderous, rain-splattered night.
Spacey and his teen-age obsession exchange unforgettable words that will
leave even the most jaded viewer reeling. Spacey's closing monologue,
indeed, his final words, will haunt us long after the lights come up and we
are left to ponder -- as if his words were not enough -- that richly
symbolic use of red: the color of jealousy and hate. And of love.
Rated R for sexuality, nudity, familial violence, pervasive language and
drug use.

Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
Being John Malkovich  Dir: Spike Jonze. Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
The pitch: A puppeteer reluctantly takes a job with a bizarre company on the
7 Â˝ floor of a NYC office tower, where he discovers a secret door leading
into the mind of actor John Malkovich.
Got that? Hereâs a wildly inventive, completely crazy satire of celebrity
obsession -- spiced with a quest for eternal life, adultery and betrayal,
madness and gender confusion. And, gulp, itâs the funniest movie of the
year.
Being John Malkovich almost defies description. First-time screenwriter
Charlie Kaufmanâs delightfully demented tale unfolds like a hallucination
that could have been penned by Lewis Carroll under heavy medication. We
guarantee the gentle readers of Cinema Uprising have never seen anything
like this. They probably never will again.
Cusack is a sensitive puppeteer whose skills just arenât in high demand,
although he blames his lagging career on âthis wintry job climate.â? His
loopy wife (Diaz), is devoted to a menagerie of house pets - a dog, assorted
cats, a neurotic chimpanzee (the monkeyâs problem stems from a childhood
âincident,â? we are told), an iguana, an aquarium of tropical fish and an
obnoxious cockatoo. The noise in their one-bedroom apartment could push
anyone over the edge.
Diaz tells her brooding husband that he needs to find a real job. Responding
to a cryptic classified ad, he takes the elevator of an office building to
the 7 Â˝ floor - yes, the elevator stops between the 7th and 8th levels.
Scrambling into the hallway, he discovers that the ceilings are only five
feet tall. Everyone walks hunched over, turning their heads sideways to
talk, like Quasimodo in the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The explanation behind
the construction of this floor is just as preposterous and equally funny.
Cusack ambles down the hall, puzzled, looking as though heâs just popped
down a rabbit hole. The receptionist talks in gibberish and confuses his
legitimate questions with sexual harassment. Flummoxed, heâs ushered in to
meet the boss, a mysterious doctor who doesnât explain the companyâs
business, but offers his new employee a position in the filing department.
The jobâs a snore, but Cusack takes an immediate liking to co-worker Maxine
(Keener), a shark in a womanâs business suit. She doesnât think much of the
scruffy puppeteer, but gets the hots for his wife. Diaz is equally smitten
with Maxine.
As if that wasnât enough trouble, Cusack discovers a tiny door behind a
filing cabinet at work. The portal opens to a narrow corridor, dripping with
mud and effluvia. He crawls inside and is propelled, as though riding a
water slide, through some sort of metaphysical corridor that deposits him
into the mind of Oscarď'-nominated actor John Malkovich. Cusack sees the
world through the eyes of Malkovich for precisely 15 minutes before he is
ejected, falling from the sky by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Itâs
an inspired bit of lunacy.
The time limit inside the actorâs mind is no doubt a reference to Andy
Warholâs comment that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.
Exhilarated, Cusack tells Maxine of his trip inside Malkovich. She smells a
business opportunity. Who wouldnât pay to be someone else - anybody else -
for 15 minutes? The fact that itâs a celebrity only sweetens the deal.
Soon customers are queued up along the office hallway, waiting to pay $200
each for a ride inside the famous actor. Cusack persuades his wife to give
it a try. Diaz slips inside the portal, but only after Maxine arranges a
date with Malkovich. That way, while sheâs inside the actorâs mind, Diaz is
able to indulge her fantasies with Maxine. She can be a man seducing a
woman. The new perspective is intoxicating. After Cusack picks her up by the
turnpike, Diaz declares that she either wants a sex-change or to be a
lesbian. Doesnât matter which. Itâs hard to convey the hilarity of this
scene, which is best experienced first-hand, as a small comic miracle that
keeps building as Cusack does a slow burn.
Malkovich is superb playing not so much himself, but perhaps the public
perception of who he is - a quiet man given to contemplation and understated
elegance. The supporting players are likewise marvelous, especially Diaz,
who seems to take delight in hiding her beauty behind a challenging role.
Cusack is always fun to watch, although this may be his best role since
Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). He fully realizes the controlling nature of his
character â` after all, for a guy who loves to pull the strings of
marionettes, what could be more satisfying than crawling inside another
personâs brain and making him do tricks?
First-time feature director Jonze, who is best known for shooting music
videos, has a fractured way of looking at the world. Itâs as though he was
peering at his characters through a prism of broken glass -- the different
facets of their personalities never throw the same reflection twice. Theyâre
unpredictable. As such, we feel off-balance in an amusing way, like
exploring a funhouse with warped mirrors and tilted floors.
Being John Malkovich belongs on any top 10 list for 1999. For all its
lunacy, this unique picture merits serious Academy Award consideration. It
is audacious, anarchic and outrageously funny filmmaking. Catch it quick. We
will not see its kind again.
Rated R for language, sexual situations.

Title
Review for Bone Collector, The (1999)
The Bone Collector  Dir: Phillip Noyce. Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina
Jolie, Queen Latifah, Ed OâNeill and Michael Rooker.
The pitch: A quadriplegic NYC homicide detective helps his protĂŠgĂŠ track
down a brilliant serial killer obsessed with true crime.
After a solid first hour of chilling suspense, this high-concept thriller
unravels completely in the final, disappointing reel. The killerâs identity
may come out of the blue, but the rationale for the killings is so
preposterous, so dependent on nearly impossible coincidences, that we just
donât believe it.
Washington plays the immobilized detective who feels suicidal four years
after a freak accident left him paralyzed below the neck, save for just
enough movement in his left index finger to allow manipulation of a computer
trackball. His computer, television monitor and telephone are all voice
activated, which is crucial to the climax. Before the accident, Washingtonâs
character was a renowned detective specializing in analysis of forensic
evidence. Confined to a motorized bed, forced to gulp oxygen from a straw
strapped to his headrest, now he only wants to die. The role is daunting â`
Washington is limited to facial expressions and changes in the tone of his
voice. His nurse, the motherly Latifah, refuses to give up on her patient,
even though he wants âto check out of this life.â?
Jolie is a novice cop who comes upon a grisly crime scene: a
multimillionaire developer buried under tons of gravel near a railroad line.
Only his hands are exposed, fingers frozen with rigor mortis as though
clutching at the air. The dead manâs wife is still missing, a captive of a
serial killer who leaves maddeningly obscure clues as to his whereabouts and
motives.
Washingtonâs friend and fellow detective, OâNeill, assigns Jolie to the
case, which is a helluva promotion for a street cop. But OâNeill has his
reasons. Jolie can be Washingtonâs surrogate at the crime scene. And he can
communicate with her via two-way radio as they try to catch the killer. It
gives Washington a reason to live.
The killerâs methods are markedly gruesome. Some victims are flayed to the
bone. One is boiled alive by steam jetting from an exhaust pipe (even in
shadow, these scenes are grisly and graphic). With Washingtonâs deductive
skills, Jolie is able to draw closer to the psychopath, despite the
interference of a territorial police captain (Rooker) â` one of those
needlessly stupid characters whose purpose is to get in the way of the
heroes just so they can prove him wrong, again and again. Rooker and the
film deserve better than this old screenwriterâs crutch.
Then again, so does the climax, which hinges on a ridiculous number of
circumstances coming together with precision timing. Not in New York City,
baby. The movie backs itself into a corner, since a confrontation between
the immobile Washington and the killer is inevitable. But how to show these
two in a battle of wits, a fight to the death, without stretching
plausibility to the breaking point? Itâs a question the filmmakers should
have answered before shooting the picture and tacking on a coda that even
Frank Capra would have found corny.
Rated R for violence, gruesome murders and language.

Title
Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
Cinema Uprising
Take an aisle seat with the most dangerous film critic in America
The World is Not Enough Dir: Michael Apted. Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards, Robbie Coltrane and Judi Dench.
The pitch: James Bond races around the globe to stop a brain-damaged
terrorist from disrupting the world's oil supply.
Secret Agent 007, now in his 19th official outing, can still act suave,
caressing women, guns and cocktails with equal ease. But the series itself
is looking long in the tooth and short on ideas.
After an old friend is killed in a bombing inside MI6 headquarters, Bond
resolves to protect the man's beautiful but emotionally scarred daughter
Elektra (Marceau, who can plop her feet on our coffee table any time). The
bewitching Elektra was once kidnapped by Bosnian terrorist Carlyle, who
still carries a bullet in his head from an attempted assassination. Although
he survived the hit, the bullet has caused irreparable neurological damage.
Carlyle can no longer feel pain. Or pleasure. The injury is slowly killing
him. Too bad this idea never develops into a big payoff at the climax. Like
most of the action in this busy film, the issue of brain damage is
introduced and quickly forgotten as Carlyle obsesses on blowing up an oil
pipeline in the Caspian Sea (think fast, film fans: how many times has the
climax of a Bond movie hinged on the threat of a thermonuclear device?).
Bond travels by jet ski and snow ski, by boat, rocket-equipped BMW and
submarine. Curiously, though, for all his globe-trotting, we never see the
super spy climb aboard or disembark from a plane (Perhaps the ancient Q and
his new sidekick -- John Clesse, in an amusing cameo -- have developed a
secret teleportation device so Bond can get around).
Brosnan, reprising the role for the third time, seems to relish his
assignment. His confidence and wry manner are well-suited to the part, which
demands a seriousness that Roger Moore could never muster and a levity that
eluded Timothy Dalton in his two-picture incarnation as Bond. Brosnan has
shrugged off the Remington Steel albatross and settled for a style somewhere
between Moore and Dalton. Still, nobody kicked super-villain ass, defused
nuclear bombs, stroked babes, smoked cigarettes, sipped martinis, raced
Aston Martins, knew more about fine wine, gave Q a hard time or muttered
more amusing quips than Sean Connery, his own bad self. And if Connery
wouldn't look absurd trying to hold his toupee in place  or face serious
risk of cardiac thrombosis (he turned 69 in August)  we'd say bring him
back, put a Walther PPK in his shoulder holster and let's rock.
If this sounds like carping, then the gentle readers of Cinema Uprising
should know that we have seen every Bond film, most of them multiple times.
We even enjoy Casino Royale (1967), the much-maligned spoof that purists don
't count as a legitimate Bond film, although in many ways it is better than
most of the movies starring Roger Moore (as Bond, or anyone else, for that
matter). So we're predisposed toward this Bond character. We know the
formula. And Brosnan is the best actor to get behind the role since Connery
vowed `nevermore.'
But the goons behind the camera are so focused on pyrotechnics, good as they
are, and gee-whiz gadgets, that no one bothered with the script. We're not
talking about believable plots. Hell, if that was a prerequisite, there
wouldn't be any Bond films.
The problem with The World is Not Enough is the characters have nothing
intelligent to say. The new Bond girl, Christmas Jones (Richards), is a case
in point. First off, the best Bond girls have ridiculously suggestive and
sexist names like Pussy Galore (Goldfinger), or Holly Goodhead (Man with the
Golden Gun), not stupid monikers like Christmas Jones, which is just a setup
for the worst closing line in any of the Bond movies. Richards plays a
nuclear bimbo-scientist, with an emphasis on the bimbo. Talk about
unbelievable: If this doe-eyed valley girl knows anything about nuclear
physics, then we'll eat plutonium. Richards hit her stride in Wild Things
(1998), a gleefully sleazy picture that still shows up on cable TV at 2 a.m.
Such roles illustrate the breadth of her talent, which doesn't stand up to
the stress of dialogue or facial expression.
Bond's tricked-out BMW turns in a better performance. Worse, he shows more
emotion for the car when it is destroyed than he does for Ms. Richards  or
the remarkable Ms. Marceau  who is a wild and an untamed thing, yet sadly
impervious to Bond's particular method of rehabilitation.
Even the fine Shakespearean actress Judi Dench, starring here as a matronly
M, is forced to declare obvious
plot points that we can see for ourselves. The portly Coltrane fares better,
reprising his role from Goldeneye (1995) as a Russian gangster. He provides
equal parts cynicism and comic relief.
The World is Not Enough just isn't enough to sate the legions of Bond fans
who must wait another two years for the next installment. Our advice is to
check out the solid first hour, then bail out for a debriefing over vodka
martinis and Beluga caviar served on toast points. Thus primed, the
discriminating viewer will head for the home theater and a nostalgic,
late-night viewing of the Bond classic, From Russia with Love (1963) on
video. As the ads once exclaimed: Sean Connery is James Bond. That's good
enough for us.
Rated PG-13 for cartoonish violence and insipid sexual double-entendres.

Title
Review for Astronaut's Wife, The (1999)
The Astronaut's Wife  Written and directed by: Rand Ravich. Starring Johnny
Depp, Charlize Theron, Joe Morton, Nick Cassavettes and Blair Brown.
The pitch: Rosemary's Baby meets E.T. in this trashy exploitation flick
apparently designed to scare the bejabbers out of pregnant women and bore
everyone else.
Affecting a suthern accent, a bleach-blond Depp sleepwalks his way through
the role of a shuttle astronaut who, while orbiting Earth, loses contact
with NASA for two minutes. He returns to Floridaa changed man.
His wife, the lovely but bland Theron, senses something is wrong, even
though she faithfully returns to her teaching job each day at the local
elementary school. But all is not well. Depp's fellow crewman, Cassavettes,
drops dead a week later at a party as his wife stares in horror. Did
something happen to the astronauts during those two minutes of silence in
space? Why, hell yes, we've got another 90 minutes to go. [Side note Part I:
Cassavettes apparently needed some quick cash to get on with his successful
career as an independent filmmaker. He's following in his dad's footsteps.
The late John Cassavettes also starred, from time to time, in some equally
cheesy, low-rent movies (check out Two Minute Warning) to pay the bills in
between his own independent projects. Side note Part II: this basic
storyline was handled with much more suspense in I Married a Monster From
Outer Space (1955).]
Okay. At Cinema Uprising we would never reveal key plot points in a good
movie: By the end of Act I, Cassavettes' wife commits suicide, which does
little to reassure Theron. Unfazed by all the sudden death, Depp picks the
only sensible solution that can propel the plot  he quits his NASA job for
a gig with a major engineering firm, packs up his wife, cuts out of Florida
and moves to New York. This worries Theron even more, since she did the same
thing with Keanu Reeves two years ago in The Devil's Advocate.
In his new job, Depp designs amazingly complex aircraft for a military
contract, raking in scads of green money. Pretty soon he's kissing corporate
ass at parties and doing an awkward bumpity-bump with his wife in public
places. Next thing we know, Theron is taking a pregnancy test in the
restroom stall at her new school. (As any would-be parent knows, those tests
are supposed to be taken first thing in the morning. Or did Mrs. Astronaut
drive all the way to work just to pee?)
Does it matter? Yes. In a movie already swollen with improbabilities, the
incorrect administration of a pregnancy test might seem like a minor sin,
but we beg to differ. We believe people deserve more for their $7 tickets
than a movie that actively defies their intelligence. Worse, we're appalled
that a film would dare to exploit a woman's greatest fear  that she might
give birth to Webster.
Theron doesn't have it quite so bad. The poor woman eventually gloms to the
fact that she's carrying twins. And Depp seems to take a preternaturally
unusual interest in their safety. One of Depp's former NASA associates tries
to warn the expectant mommy that she's carrying a heap o' trouble, times
two. Problem is, the doomsayer is played by Joe Morton, a character actor
who gets killed in practically all his movies. Who's going to believe him?
Or the preposterous ending, with cheap-looking special effects and Theron
acting like she's swallowed enough Quaaludes that somebody ought to call
poison control.
Stoned, sedentary or fast asleep, The Astronaut's Wife is still a space
cadet.
Rated R for language and uncomfortable-looking sex.

Title
Review for House on Haunted Hill (1999)
House on Haunted Hill  Dir: William Malone. Starring Geoffrey Rush, Famke
Janssen, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher and Chris
Kattan.
The pitch: A wealthy amusement-park owner promises a group of strangers $1
million each if they survive a night in a haunted house.
Tis the season for lousy horror films. This one could have been called
House on Moron Hill, since idiots typically congregate in these movies,
waiting in some dark manor for the bogeyman to come along and slit their
throats. Vincent Price hammed it up in the cheesy 1958 original, directed by
gimmickmeister William Castle. Back then, the going rate for sleepovers in
haunted houses was a paltry $10,000. Well, the pay is better these days,
even if the movie isn't. Hell, in this picture there isn't even a proper
house up on yon haunted hill. It's a derelict hospital.
As we learn in flashback, the 1937 art-deco building was actually an asylum
for the criminally insane. The equally mad doctor who runs the place decides
to practice surgery on the inmates without benefit of anesthesia (graphic
and gory). They revolt and kill the staff (pencil stabbing through one man's
neck, implied rape, much blood letting and other mayhem unsuitable for
children). But when the crazies set the building on fire, they're trapped
inside after steel shutters automatically seal off the doors and windows.
The ridiculous shutters serve no purpose except to advance the plot when we
fast-forward 60 years.
Cut to: Geoffrey Rush as Steven Price, successful owner of spooky-themed
amusement parks (the character's name is no doubt a nod to Vincent Price,
though we wonder if the late actor would have been honored or appalled).
Chewing the sets, Rush acts like James Woods acting like Vincent Price.
He forgets that his bitchy wife (Janssen) wants a birthday party. Their
marriage is the real horror show. The poisonous verbal exchanges between
these two are both obvious and lowbrow (Screenwriter Dick Beebe could learn
a lot from Edward Albee).
When Janssen reminds her hated hubby about the party, he shreds her guest
list and replaces it with one of his own. Preparing the invitations, Rush
offers $1 million to every person who lives through the night at the
house/hospital on haunted hill. The reason for this generosity is never
explained, which shows the contempt everyone involved in this project has
for the audience. Rush snickers at his little joke and goes back to
designing roller coasters. Problem is, something erases the guest list on
his computer and sends party invitations to four strangers. Could it be the
work of that evil house/hospital? Golly!
Greed compels an out-of-work pro baseball player (Diggs, who's treated like
a token black) to attend the party. He's joined by a bland doctor
(Gallagher), who doesn't need the money, and a couple of interchangeable
blondes (Larter and Wilson) who probably do. Kattan (who is seldom funny on
Saturday Night Live) is their escort to the gated entrance at the foot of
the haunted hill. Knowing something of the hill's storied past, he whines
and snivels, and demands his money from Rush, who seems as puzzled to be in
the old place as everyone else. That doesn't make sense, which is in keeping
with the silly story.
Soon Janssen comes a-slinkin' down the stairs, and she and Rush start
squabbling again. But before either can hurl a choice insult, those creaky
steel shutters come down, the lights go out and the screaming begins.
Damn shame it isn't scary. Anyone who's been plunking down cash for
horror-movie tickets for any length of time may well slip into a coma
watching this one. The special effects (reportedly rushed) are unconvincing
and cheap-looking. The only diversion comes from guessing which of the
repugnant characters will get killed next.
There's plenty of acting talent on board, all of it wasted. Rush scored an
Oscar? for Shine and was hilarious in Shakespeare in Love. Gallagher can do
good supporting work when he has an exceptional script to work with (check
out sex, lies and videotape, The Player and, especially, American Beauty).
Diggs set the screen on fire with Angela Bassett in How Stella Got Her
Groove Back, but he throws nary a spark in this low-rent drivel.
House on Haunted Hill could have been big fun, if some of the gore and
language was toned down to drop the rating to at least a PG-13. Then the
picture would have had an audience.
William Castle, who's been dead these 22 years, understood showmanship and
his audience. He delivered cheap thrills to bored 1950s kids. Castle was not
a brilliant filmmaker, merely competent. But he excelled at marketing and
promotion. Castle directed more than 50 no-budget movies, mainly in the
horror genre.
Funny thing is, all of them are better than this ridiculous remake.
Rated R for gore and naughty language.

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
Dogma  Written and directed by: Kevin Smith. Starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt
Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, George Carlin, Salma Hayek,
Jason Mewes, Alanis Morisette, Smith and assorted surprise cameos.
The pitch: a woman suffering a crisis of faith must stop two fallen angels
from sneaking back into Heaven and thereby negating existence in this
ribald, raunchy and occasionally provocative satire of Roman Catholicism by
the director of Clerks.
By turns gleefully offensive, juvenile and, yes, even brilliant, this edgy
comic parable doesn't deserve the hail of criticism raining from some
(non-official) segments of the Catholic Church. A contingent of bishops,
meanwhile, is calling for a boycott. Verily, film fans, here is the gospel:
those who lose or even doubt their faith after seeing this film didn't have
a strong grasp on it to begin with. The director is clearly a religious man,
if not a devout Catholic in the traditional sense. And he knows the Bible
better than some of his critics. His intent here is to question the
machinations and politics of the church, not the underlying principles of
faith that members embrace for meaning in their lives. And Smith doesn't
push as far as he could have gone: his camera never even enters a sanctuary.
No blasphemy has been committed here, although the picture is assuredly not
for all tastes. Perhaps the greatest offense, though, comes from people who
would condemn Dogma without seeing it. We can't do anything about that,
since willful ignorance and hypocrisy are not crimes in this country. Then
again, neither is blasphemy. Smith's great success is he removes religion
from the holier-than-thou hands of official church spokesmen and turns
possession over to the clumsy and imperfect people who must live in this
world.
Fiorentino stars as Bethany, a world-weary worker at an abortion clinic. One
of the movie's quiet ironies is Bethany's infertility. Alone in bed, she
receives a message from God in the form of a fireball that turns into Alan
Rickman (recall the terrorist leader in Die Hard). The sensible Bethany
blasts a fire extinguisher at the intruder, then threatens to crown him with
a baseball bat. She cools off when Rickman unfurls his wings and tells her
to settle down. Affecting a fey English accent, he explains that Bethany
must stop a pair of fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) from passing beneath
the archway of a renovated church in New Jersey. These wicked angels once
were God's messengers of doom  the fiery Old Testament stuff - but they
fell from Her favor and She banished them toWisconsin. Eager to regain
entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven after spending millennia in the land of
cheese, they discover a loophole in Catholic dogma.  If Damon and Affleck
walk through the church in Jersey, they may have a plenary indulgence  what
Catholics call instant forgiveness for all sins  which entitles direct
admission into Heaven. Problem is, that would show God is fallible. And that
would trigger an outcome worse than the apocalypse - all would cease to
exist.
The cardinal of the church (George Carlin, having a blast) plans to
rededicate his sanctuary to God with a new marketing campaign endorsed by
the Vatican  Catholicism Wow! At a press conference, Carlin unveils a
statue of the Buddy Christ, a grinning, winking figure with a prominent
thumbs up. Buddy is a new totem for a new generation bored with the
traditional symbols and rituals of the church (The posture of Buddy Christ
also bears passing resemblance to Mr. Natural, the brain-addled philosopher
in Robert Crumb's underground comics. That, if anything, might rankle the
devout, assuming they are hip to the subreference).
Back in Wisconsin, Damon enjoys toying with the fragile faithful. Wandering
through an airport like some sinister Hare Krishna, he convinces a nun that
she has wasted her life. Soon the poor sister heads off in search of a
one-night stand and fashionable clothing. Damon and Affleck snicker at their
mischief.
Bethany seems a strange choice to stop a pair of rotten angels. She is a
reluctant hero, preferring to tithe her salary from Planned Parenthood to
the church. Only when her life is saved by two unlikely prophets, Jay and
Silent Bob (Mewes and director Smith), does she believe in the urgency of
her mission. Jay and Silent Bob are recurring characters in all of the
director's films. Jay is coarse and chatty, a stoner with a sharp, foul
tongue who cannot conceal his basic cluelessness. And he damn-near steals
the film. As Silent Bob, Smith has three words of dialogue in the entire
picture, but his range of facial expressions can bring down the house. They
hook up with Bethany after she is attacked outside the abortion clinic by
three teenage demons wielding hockey sticks. After Jay and Silent Bob
dispatch the thugs, Bethany wants to know why they're hanging around an
abortion clinic.
`We thought it would be a good place to meet loose women,' Jay declares.
Together, this triumvirate is joined by Rufus, the 13th apostle (Chris Rock)
who literally falls from the sky to help them.
Rufus says his role was left out of the Bible because he's black. He also
claims Jesus once told him the meaning of life during a wedding reception in
Cana, `but I got drunk and forgot it.'
They meet a stripper-muse (the delectable Hayek). She claims to be the
inspiration for 19 of the 20 top-grossing movies of all time. But she won't
take credit for Home Alone.
`Someone sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of
crap,' she declares.
Extending the metaphor, the heroes are soon attacked by an excrement demon
that rises from a toilet and, wellwhat's a Kevin Smith movie without a
little potty humor?
While Bethany and her holy helpers ponder how to fight the demon, Damon and
Affleck make their way across the country, spreading murder and mayhem. The
fallen angels crash a board meeting of The Mooby Corporation, a company
clearly modeled after Disney (which passed on distributing this film,
fearing the ensuing controversy). Damon berates the board members. Enjoying
the power of omnipotence, he chronicles their private sins and then
slaughters them all, splattering their blood on the corporate mascot -- a
golden calf wearing Mickey Mouse pants.
Smith's screenplay is crammed with pop-cultural references, both sly and
obvious, from Star Wars characters to ancient commercials for floor wax. At
times, we wonder if he might be trying too hard, especially during the
longish second hour when each character gets to deliver a speech (sermon?)
that earnestly explains the importance of faith  regardless of religious
denominations.
The director also wobbles at the climax, when Affleck and Damon lay waste to
a city block surrounding the church. These and other scenes of jarring
violence seem out of place in a comedy. The bloodshed throws off the tone of
the film  illustrating once again that, as with most art forms, less is
more. When the point is made, move on.
Perhaps Smith is struggling to maintain his momentum. Maybe he'll sustain
that high note in his next film. But in Dogma, after soaring completely over
the top with two hours of anarchic excess, he literally ends with a squeak
when Alanis Morisette arrives for her cameo as God. Morisette may be an
impassioned vocalist, but she's no actor. And a movie that wants to push the
satirical limit needs a climax that packs an ungodly wallop and an almighty
bang, not the thespian exertions of a rank amateur.
Rated R for constant foul language, scatological humor, brief (but potent)
violence.
