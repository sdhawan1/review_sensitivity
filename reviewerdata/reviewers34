Title
Review for Dirty Dancing (1987)
     Based on the previews, you probably wouldn't go see DIRTY DANCING unless
you're either bored out of your skull or under 16.  And you'd miss a real gem.
I was curious because the screenplay was written by a woman, and this is pretty
rare for the usual LA-LA fare.  (I had visions of my delight at ROMANCING THE
STONE--for once a heroine not made of perfumed cardboard.)
     I was expecting SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.  But what I saw was a tight,
emotional, well-told story of a fall from innocence.  With real people.  It's
the summer of '63, the the twilight of the Camelot days.  If this is a movie
for kiddies, they'll never understand that special time.  With Kennedy's death
and then into Vietnam, we all grew up in a hurry.
     Interestingly, as with ROMANCING THE STONE, it's the male characters who
are a bit stereotypical.  The male lead (one of these days I'll remember names
of actors, directors, et al.  and write *real* reviews) is a classic "noble
savage" right out of Rousseau, but you want to believe it anyway.  There's also
a slimy, effete twit who justifies his arrogance in a marvelous scene where he
pulls a copy of THE FOUNTAINHEAD out of his pocket and tells the female lead,
"It's all in here.  I've made notes in the margins."
     Ah, Jennifer Grey.  She did a first-class, remarkably subtle job on a part
that begs to be overacted.  And can she dance or what?
     No great piece of cinema, but a damn good movie.  I'd give it a solid 2
stars on the Leeper Scale.  The Ayn Rand-trashing scene alone is worth the
price of evening admission.
