Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
Double Jeopardy
http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/double_jeopardy.html
/Double Jeopardy/ is a movie that could've been much superior, with
less contrivances and better acting.  The premise, based on the Fifth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, is an interesting one, but is
executed with too much sentimentality and not enough substance.
Libby (Ashley Judd) and Nick Parsons (Bruce Greenwood) take a cruise
together, alone, and one night Libby finds herself following a trail
of blood and missing a husband. She is charged for the crime and
convicted, where she spends time in prison insisting she is
innocent. A miraculous turn of events alert her to the fact that her
husband is still alive, and convinced by one of her prison-mates, she
decides to go after him and kill him (after all, according to the
Constitution, you cannot be convicted of the same crime twice).  The
point however remains: why kill when you can expose the fraud and be
pardoned?
So she gets parole and runs into Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), a
parole officer who has seen better days.  In her quest to find her
husband, Libby violates parole and is pursued by Travis who slowly
realises the fraud that is occurring and works with Libby to bring Nick
to justice.
So what's good about the film?  I thought /Double Jeopardy/ was
surprisingly fast-paced. Perhaps it was the company, but the time
seemed to just fly by after the initial events leading to Libby's
imprisonment.  The acting is generally mediocre though Tommy Lee Jones
has a few redeeming moments. The script/dialogue isn't great
either.  However, because of the premise, the pacing, and 
make the film  worth renting someday.
