Title
Review for 8MM (1999)
Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, the P.I. looking for the killer of the
girl in the mystery 8mm reel. The reel was found in the safe of a
millionaire(billionaire?), and the widow wants to know for sure if the
murder is authentic or not. Tom takes up the case after concluding
that the murder is real. He is given free reign over the budget to
find the perpetuators. He travels to Hollywood after finding a secret
note in the girls house, then to New York City to stalk the killer. On
his stop in Hollywood, he befriends a porn store clerk. Max(Joaquin
Phoenix) brings a welcome bit of lightness to an otherwise morose
film.
8MM is a prototypical Schumacher film, as Joel bends over backwards to
let us know that Snuff Films are bad. The mistake he made in "A Time
Kill", and he repeats here, is that he tries too hard to make bad guys
look evil to justify the ensuing vengeance.  There is also a tedious
subplot between Tom and his wife which should have been cut. I applaud
Nicholas Cage and Joel Schumacher for tackling such a taboo subject,
but the finished work is unconvincing as a study of someone who takes
the law into his own hands.
